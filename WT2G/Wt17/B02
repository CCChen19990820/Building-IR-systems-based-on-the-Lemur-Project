Congress once again is debating an increase in the minimum wage, this time from $4.25 an hour to $5.15. Although proponents argue that declining real wages require an increase to provide a decent living wage for low-income workers, a minimum wage hike in fact will harm unskilled Americans by destroying entry-level job opportunities.<sup>1</sup>  Further, it will do nothing to increase the income of nonworking families, while raising prices for both the poor and non-poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Decreeing an increase in the minimum wage does not address the underlying cause of stagnant wages: slow productivity growth. Before raising the minimum wage, Congress must ask itself a fundamental question: Should it be illegal for Americans, young or old, to work at even a part-time job for $4.50 or $5.00 an hour?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While proponents make emotionally appealing arguments for raising the minimum wage, these arguments are misleading. To be sure, increasing the minimum wage will help some low-income workers, but it will have the opposite effect for many more Americans. It is also an inefficient way to boost the income of poor households. Among the reasons:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Increasing the minimum wage to $5.15 will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and destroying over 200,000 entry-level job opportunities by 1999.</b> The minimum wage is an uncompassionate tax by which some low-wage workers increase their earnings while others lose their opportunity to earn anything at all. Raising it will effectively prohibit people from working unless their skills are worth at least $5.15 per hour.
<p>
<li><b>Raising the minimum wage generally does not help low-income households.</b> The reason?  Over half of the increased income from minimum wage jobs would go to youth and spouses living in families that are well-off, rather than to poor minimum wage workers.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, because almost half of minimum wage workers work <i>voluntarily</i> part time, many working only part year, 90 cents more per hour will not substantially increase their annual income but could cost them their jobs.
<p><li><b>Increasing the minimum wage does not help poor families because most do not have anyone working at the minimum wage.</b><sup>3</sup>  Of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour.
<p>
<li><b>Hiking the minimum wage will cost consumers and workers about $2.2 billion per year as the higher cost of entry-level jobs is passed on through higher prices and lower real wages.</b> Taxpayers will also be asked to shell out billions more for ineffective government training programs because the higher minimum wage has priced unskilled Americans out of the job market.<sup>4</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the past 25 years, the United States has moved from a manufacturing to a global service economy, competition has increased, and more American women are working than ever before. Employers are straining under unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, and taxes that have slowed productivity and limited real wage growth. But instead of addressing the impediments to wage growth imposed by government, proponents prefer to blame employers for stagnating wages and curry favor with voters by proposing another hike in the minimum wage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Imposing another mandate that raises prices and destroys entry-level job opportunities, however, is not a compassionate or sensible response to the problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of hiking the minimum wage, Congress and the Administration should focus on removing the barriers to productivity and wage growth that they have imposed on the private sector. Specifically, Congress and the Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Cut payroll taxes.</b> Studies also show that changes in legally mandated benefits are largely shifted to workers in the form of lower real wages.<sup>5</sup>  Cutting payroll taxes will directly increase take-home pay.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the capital gains tax.</b> This will reduce investment disincentives, increase wages by raising productivity, and increase small business formation and associated job opportunities.
<p>
<li><b>Balance the budget.</b> This will increase total domestic saving, lower interest rates, and increase investment. The growth in capital per worker is closely associated over time with the growth in labor productivity.
<p>
<li><b>Increase the skills of the future workforce.</b> What is needed is fundamental change aimed at improving basic education through school choice and enabling local educators to strengthen core curricula, improve discipline, and set high expectations.
<p>
<li><b>Increase the skills of the current workforce.</b> Enable employers to offer minimum wage apprenticeships that permit businesses to pay the minimum wage as a combination of cash and tax-creditable education.
<p>
<li><b>Enact significant regulatory reform.</b> The explosion of new regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital, creating barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs. The regulatory bureaucracy needs to be rolled back and job-killing labor regulations eliminated.
</ul><p>
<b>INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE WILL DESTROY JOB OPPORTUNITIES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vast majority of economists accept that raising the minimum wage will mean fewer job opportunities for lower-skilled workers. Using one of the nation's leading models of the U.S. economy, Heritage economists have estimated the effect of raising the minimum wage 90 cents an hour over the next two years on entry-level job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>  According to the Heritage analysis:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A 90 cent increase will cause employers to create over 200,000 <I>fewer</I> entry-level jobs each year by 1999, after which the impact declines. The rise in the minimum wage will increase the unemployment rate by at least 0.1 percentage points in 1998.
<p>
<li>Prices will be at least 0.2 percentage points higher through 1998 as employers pass their increased costs on to both poor and non-poor consumers.
<p>
The minimum wage hurts unskilled Americans the most. A recent study by David Neumark at Michigan State University reveals that the significant negative effects on the employment prospects of unskilled teenagers are masked by their replacement in the work force by more highly skilled teens.<sup>7 </sup>
<p>
<li>The increase in the minimum wage proposed by President Clinton would increase the number of unskilled teens who are neither in school nor at work by almost 20 percent. Moreover, there is evidence that teens may actually drop out of school earlier in response to a higher minimum wage. 
</ul><P>
<b>FACTS ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS MISSING FROM THE DEBATE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For the most part, the 3.7 million workers who work at or below the minimum wage can be broken down into two broad groups.<sup>8</sup> 
<p><ul>
<li><b>About half are teenagers or young adults age 21 or less</b>, and most (68.2 percent) of these young workers live in families with incomes two or more times the official poverty level for their family size.<sup>9</sup>  The average family income of a teenage minimum wage worker is around $47,000. Only 12 percent of these young workers live in poor families. 
<p>
<li><b>The other half are workers ages 22 and up.</b> More of these workers live in poor families (27 percent or 367,000 have family incomes below the poverty level) or near poverty (44 percent have family incomes less than one and one-half times the poverty level). However, even among this half of the minimum wage population, 39 percent live in families with incomes two or more times the poverty level, and the average family income of minimum wage workers ages 25 to 61 is around $25,000.
<p>
<li><b>Only 23 percent of minimum wage workers were the sole breadwinners in their families in the previous year.</b><sup>10</sup>  The wage and salary earnings of 56 percent of minimum wage workers account for 25 percent or less of their families' total wage and salary income.
<p>
<li><b>Only 16 percent of minimum wage workers are full-year, full-time employees.</b> Thirty-three percent are part-year, part-time employees, and almost half (48.5 percent) are <I>voluntary</I> part-time workers.<sup>11</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Almost 40 percent of the sole breadwinners earning the minimum wage are voluntary part-time workers,</b> while only 18.8 percent of all minimum wage workers are family heads or spouses working full time.<sup>12</sup>
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is incorrect to portray entry-level minimum wage jobs as lifetime dead-end jobs. Instead they should be recognized as opportunities for most people to establish a track record of work and a springboard to better paying jobs. More than 60 percent of all workers can point to a minimum wage job as their first job experience.<sup>13</sup>  Some 40 percent of workers starting a minimum wage job will receive their first raise within 4 months, and 63 percent of those workers will be earning 20 percent more than the minimum wage within 12 months.<sup>14</sup>  George McGovern put it best when he said, "We forget that too often a job -- any job -- is the best training for a better or more specialized job."<sup>15</sup> 
<p>
<b>THE MINIMUM WAGE DESTROYS ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND INCREASES GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before raising the minimum wage, Congress must ask itself two fundamental questions: Should it be illegal for Americans, young or old, to work at even a part-time job for $4.50 or $5.00 an hour?  And does the federal government have the right to destroy the economic freedom of families by telling parents that their young son or daughter may not work this summer for $4.50 an hour, or that a senior citizen may not work part-time for $5.00 an hour next year? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proponents defend a minimum wage increase by declaring it to be a moral issue and a moral imperative -- not just an economic or political consideration. The minimum wage, however, epitomizes government paternalism at its worst. It presumes that politicians are morally justified in destroying some people's jobs in order to inflate other people's wages. The American principle of economic freedom has been replaced by the principle of "government knows best."  Decreeing a higher minimum wage without mandating that every American be given a job just knocks the bottom rung off the economic ladder and denies millions their opportunity to begin pursuing the American Dream. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The state of Oregon, in a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court defending its 1917 minimum wage law, revealed the actual implications of such laws: "If Simpson [a woman thrown out of work by the Oregon law] cannot be trained to yield output that does not pay the cost of her own labor, then she can... accept the status of a defective to be segregated for special treatment as a dependent of the state."<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Government must share the blame for stagnant wages. Over the years, more and more mandates, higher and higher taxes, and overregulation have shackled the economy, limited productivity, and stagnated real wage growth.<sup>17</sup>  Employers do not -- indeed cannot -- unfairly keep down the wages of their lower-skilled and entry-level employees. Employers, as well as workers, operate within a competitive labor market in which wage rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers -- less the costs of government-imposed mandates and taxes associated with employing a worker. But instead of addressing the impediments to wage growth imposed by government, proponents prefer to blame employers for stagnating wages and curry favor with voters by proposing another hike in the minimum wage. Imposing another mandate that raises prices and destroys entry-level job opportunities, however, is not a compassionate or sensible response to the problem.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Raising the minimum wage appeals to the sense of decency and compassion of Americans. But it would be a mistake. Increasing the minimum wage would impose significant costs, primarily on those unskilled Americans a minimum wage hike is supposed to help. It also would raise prices for both the poor and non-poor. It would destroy entry-level job opportunities that otherwise would have been created, and although it could raise some workers' family incomes above poverty, it would do so at the cost of denying jobs to many more workers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To raise the standard of living of minimum wage workers without imposing these costs, Congress should focus on policies that would raise worker productivity while reducing government-imposed labor costs on employers.

<title>Warning to North Korea: Stop Provocations and Talk Peace With South Korea - Heritage</title>

<h3>WARNING TO NORTH KOREA: STOP PROVOCATIONS AND TALK PEACE WITH SOUTH KOREA</h3>

(Updating <I>Backgrounder Update</I> No. 236, "Clinton's Korea Policy Falls Short: A Call to Congressional Action," January 13, 1995, and Asian Studies Center <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 133, "The Clinton Nuclear Deal with Pyongyang: Road Map to Progress or Dead End Street?," November 4, 1994.)
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On three different occasions this past week, communist North Korea sent armed troops into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the border separating the North from South Korea. These provocative moves directly violate the 1953 Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the Korean War. They also raise questions about North Korea's intentions. At risk is not only the security of America's ally, the Republic of Korea, but the safety and security of 37,000 U.S. troops stationed on the Korean Peninsula. These hostile steps come at a time when the Clinton Administration continues its flawed policy of providing economic benefits to North Korea and improving political relations with its government in the absence of any improvement in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Bill Clinton will visit South Korea on April 16. He will be stopping over on his way to the Japan summit to meet briefly with South Korean President Kim Young Sam. While on Cheju Island, off the peninsula's southwestern tip, President Clinton, in close coordination with President Kim, should make it clear to Pyongyang that unless North Korea takes immediate steps to reduce tensions, the U.S. will curtail its current policy of upgrading U.S.-North Korean relations and bolstering the North's failing economy.
<p>
<b>Pyongyang Attacks the Armistice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

North Korea's recent military moves are a direct attack on the 1953 United Nations-brokered Armistice Agreement that ended hostilities of the Korean War. The Armistice established a Military Armistice Commission (MAC) to maintain the cease-fire, serve as a military channel of communication, and investigate violations of the Armistice. The MAC, too, is sanctioned by the United Nations. The Armistice also established the existing DMZ and the Joint Security Area (JSA) which straddles the border. The JSA is a small, circular compound where the MAC meetings and occasional North-South negotiations have taken place over the years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has taken steps to undermine the functions of the MAC. It refuses to attend scheduled MAC meetings, thus closing the only channel for military communication along the world's most heavily armed border. On April 4, Pyongyang declared that it "shall give up its duty, under the armistice agreement, concerning the maintenance and control of the military demarcation line and the DMZ."  The next day, several hundred heavily armed North Korean soldiers entered the North's side of the JSA and carried out what appeared to be combat training drills. Similar incursions took place on April 6 and 7. These actions are serious violations of the Armistice agreement. Each side is limited to only 35 troops in its sector. Another violation occurred when on April 7 North Korean troops carried rifles, machine guns, and mortars into the Joint Security Area. Soldiers in the JSA are restricted to sidearms only.
<P>
<b>The North's Quest for a Peace Treaty with the U.S.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Pyongyang openly admits that this deliberate destruction of the existing Armistice structure is aimed at a long-standing goal: convincing the U.S. to sign a bilateral peace treaty with the North. Pyongyang hopes that such a treaty would cut Seoul out of the military settlement and pave the way for the withdrawal of American forces from Korea. The Clinton Administration rightly insists that the U.S. will never sign such a deal. Since the U.S. fought in the Korean War under the U.N. banner, it should not be attempting to negotiate with North Korea on its own. The only sensible replacement of the existing structure is a peace treaty negotiated and signed by North and South Korean governments.
<p>
<b>U.S. Flexibility Encourages North Korean Belligerence</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has chosen this bold and provocative course of action because the Clinton Administration's Korea policy is weak and misguided. The foundation of Clinton's policy is the "Agreed Framework" of October 1994. Negotiated in an effort to stop the North's menacing nuclear weapons program, the Framework offered certain benefits to the North, including gradual improvement of trade and political ties with Washington, a $50 million-per-year fuel oil supply, and the construction of two nuclear reactors in the North worth about $5 billion. Washington is working with about a dozen allies to raise money to support the deal, but Seoul has pledged to pick up most of the tab. In return, the North agreed to freeze its current nuclear program, thus preventing it from amassing any more weapons-grade plutonium. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, the Clinton Administration backed down on its earlier insistence that Pyongyang immediately provide a full accounting of the plutonium it has produced. Inspection of its fuel storage sites, which the North is obligated to permit under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, has been delayed for years to come. In the meantime, the North may be constructing nuclear bombs secretly with the enriched fuel it currently possesses. Even the Clinton Administration admits that the U.S. has no way of detecting such a covert program. The North was pleased with the deal since it offers lucrative benefits yet allows it to keep its nuclear card. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Under the Agreed Framework, the North also promised to engage in dialogue with the South and make progress toward tension reduction. But Pyongyang has refused to do this. In fact, as the events of recent days indicate, tensions are as high as ever. The North's million-man army maintains its forward deployment. Its large stockpiles of chemical weapons are of grave concern to U.S. military commanders. The North has a growing missile arsenal which is capable of striking all parts of South Korea.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Agenda While in South Korea</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's Korea policies have failed to protect America's interests on the Korean Peninsula: the reduction of military tension along the DMZ. The North's recent provocations are disturbing evidence not only of its contempt for the Armistice, but for Clinton's Framework agreement as well. While in South Korea on April 16, President Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Express strong U.S. condemnation of the North's actions and reiterate Washington's commitment to the defense of South Korea.</b> The U.S. should bolster U.S. forces in South Korea with AWACS radar aircraft and temporarily deploy one more aircraft carrier to the 7th fleet in the Pacific. These additional forces are necessary to deter the North from undertaking real aggression against the South.
<p>
<li><b>Clearly state that the U.S. will never consider a bilateral peace treaty with the North.</b> President Clinton should remind the North that, in the Reconciliation Agreement ratified by the North and South in 1992, the two sides pledged to negotiate a North-South peace agreement. Clinton should demand that the North abide by this commitment.
<p>
<li><b>
Press Pyongyang for immediate initiation of substantive, high-level talks with Seoul.</b> The 1992 North-South Reconciliation Agreement is a detailed document outlining practical steps toward easing political and military tensions between the two sides and could serve as a blueprint for future dialogue. The North has refused to implement this agreement and instead has focused its efforts on improving its ties with the U.S.
<p>
<li><b>
Remind Pyongyang that the U.S.-North Korean nuclear accord explicitly links tension reduction with the political and economic benefits offered to the North.</b> President Clinton should warn Pyongyang that if it continues to violate both the spirit and letter of the Framework, it will put at risk further implementation of the Framework agreement.
<p>
<li><b>
Discuss with Seoul the appointment of a seasoned American negotiator as a special envoy to jump-start the tension reduction process.</b> A special envoy could seek regular contacts at the highest levels of Pyongyang's secretive and insular ruling elite. He could make clear to the North that the U.S. and South Korea will no longer tolerate the North's provocations. If this message is not hammered home to Pyongyang forcefully and regularly, the North will continue to underestimate America's resolve and misjudge its intentions.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Now that the Cold War is over, Pyongyang no longer has China and the Soviet Union standing in the wings prepared to back its military aggression. Nevertheless, apparently oblivious to this fact, North Korea is threatening the peace on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. needs to act now to send North Korea a message: stop the military provocation, live up to its agreements, and start talking peace with Seoul.

For the first time in 5,000 years of China's history, a Chinese people have directly elected their leader. This impressive exercise in democracy took place on March 23 in the Republic of China on Taiwan with the election of President Lee Teng-hui. Equally impressive, however, has been the pace of political evolution in the ROC that has transformed a one-party authoritarian system into a multi-party democracy. The direct popular re-election of President Lee was the capstone in a ten-year process of liberalizing national politics and developing democracy on Taiwan, and took place even as China was conducting a campaign of military intimidation against Taiwan. Democracy on Taiwan is of great political and strategic importance. Policymakers in Washington cannot ignore the reality of Taiwan's democracy when dealing with mainland China.

<p>

<b>The Road to Democracy on Taiwan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the ending of martial law in 1987 and the legalization of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition party, the democratic transformation of Taiwan has spread across the political landscape at the local, county, provincial, and national levels. In 1992, Taiwan held the first full election of its law-making body (the Legislative Yuan);<sup>1</sup> in December 1994, ROC citizens directly elected Taiwan's provincial governor for the first time. The growth of democracy also involved amending the constitution of the Republic of China in 1994 to allow for the direct election of the president.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taiwan's democratic transformation culminated in a four-month span from December 2, 1995, when ROC citizens for the second time elected members to the Legislative Yuan, to March 23, 1996, when they went to the polls to elect their president directly for the first time.
<p>
<b>The March Election</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 23, 1996, over 10.7 million of Taiwan's 14.3 million eligible voters cast their ballots in the first direct, democratic election of the president of the Republic of China. Incumbent President Lee Teng-hui won re-election overwhelmingly, with 54 percent of the vote. Former political prisoner and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Peng Ming-min came in a distant second with 21 percent of the vote, and New Party candidate Lin Yang-gang and independent Chen Li-an received under 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Winning 54 percent of the vote in a four-way race with 76 percent voter participation earned President Lee Teng-hui an overwhelming mandate to push forward his platform of greater "dignity, vitality, and grand development" for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although overshadowed by the presidential election, elections for the Third National Assembly also were held on March 23. In the National Assembly, the ROC institution charged with managing constitutional reform, the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party) maintained its slim majority with 54 percent of the 334 seats. The formerly independent seats were nearly equally divided between the DPP and the New Party, with slightly more going to the DPP. The DPP improved its representation in the assembly from 12.6 percent to 29.6 percent, while the New Party went from zero to 13.7 percent representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the elections of December 1995 and March 1996, the KMT maintains a slim majority in both the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan and thus will have to form coalitions in order to conduct the business of government. In the National Assembly, Taiwan's constitutional democracy will have to deal with the political agenda of Taiwan's evolving loyal opposition. The DPP has campaigned for constitutional amendments to eliminate the National Assembly and the office of Taiwan's provincial governor. The KMT opposes these changes, but supports less drastic measures such as extending Legislative Yuan terms from three to four years.
<p>

<b>China's Missile Diplomacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing could not have made the contrast between the two Chinese systems more clear. On one side was the PRC -- a communist, one-party, authoritarian state. On the other, a thriving democracy. The PRC threatened the ROC with three military exercises in the three weeks leading up to and during Taiwan's democratic election. The exercises interfered with international commerce and threatened investors' confidence in Taiwan. Almost daily, Beijing shrilly charged President Lee Teng-hui with using "false" democracy to establish a dictatorship on Taiwan. The Chinese also accused Lee of wanting to split Taiwan away from the motherland. Similarly, China warned the United States that it would pay a high price, more dear than in Korea and Vietnam, if it intervened in the Beijing-Taipei dispute -- China's internal affair. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Beijing's military intimidation proved ineffective and counterproductive. The elections took place as scheduled and Lee's margin of victory exceeded expectations. In fact, China's military exercises may have contributed greatly to Lee Teng-hui's overwhelming victory. Many analysts predicted that Lee would have difficulty winning a majority in a four-way race, especially given the good showing of the DPP and New Party in the Legislative Yuan election last December. Partly because of China's missile diplomacy, this turned out not to be the case.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's use of force also failed to accomplish its international objective: to reconfirm to the world that Taiwan is China's internal affair in which the U.S. should not interfere. While the "one China" policy remains official U.S. policy, the PRC's show of force provoked joint resolutions from Congress that urged a stronger commitment to Taiwan's defense than even the former U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty allowed.<sup>2</sup>  That pressure from Congress almost certainly played a role in the Administration's decision to send two aircraft carriers to the vicinity of Taiwan to monitor Beijing's "war games."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's military threats forced Washington to be less ambiguous in its commitments to Taiwan. Previously, the Clinton Administration had maintained that the use of military force to protect Taiwan would depend on circumstances and developments. The dispatch of two carrier battlegroups sent a less ambiguous message. It implied that the U.S. was prepared to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan under current circumstances. In addition, Beijing's heavy-handed tactics soured China's image in the eyes of the American public and policymakers, making it more difficult for the U.S. to pursue its policy of "constructive engagement" with China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the March crisis, Beijing asserted its resolve to use force to keep Taiwan from declaring independence. The U.S. demonstrated its resolve to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan. And Taiwan demonstrated its resolve to move forward with political liberalization, even in the face of Beijing's military threat. In this standoff Taipei was the clear winner, Beijing the clear loser, and Washington fell somewhere in between. Taiwan stood up to Beijing's threats, garnered favorable world-wide headlines, and elicited further demonstrations of support from the United States. By contrast, Beijing soured global public opinion with its irresponsible display of military force and provoked a stronger than expected military response from the United States. In Washington, the Congress and media pushed a reluctant Clinton Administration into a stronger position vis-…-vis China and Taiwan. 
<p>

<b> A New Strategic Environment</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now that the Taiwan elections are over, it is time for the U.S. to take stock of its positions and policies toward China and Taiwan. Ever since 1950, when President Truman sent the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait at the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. has been part of a strategic triangle with the PRC and the ROC. For 46 years America's aim has been to prevent either the PRC or the ROC from using non-peaceful means to resolve the question of Taiwan's status. This triangular relationship survived near nuclear crises in the 1950s and changes in diplomatic recognition in the 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise of democracy on Taiwan changes this triangular relationship and forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance. Economic and political freedom on Taiwan amplify the lack of similar freedoms in China. Taiwan has proven that free enterprise and democracy are compatible with and desirable in a Chinese society. Taiwan's rapid progress leaves many Americans impatient for similarly rapid change on the mainland. For the U.S., democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking improved relations with China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For China, democracy on Taiwan takes away Beijing's self-proclaimed ability to speak for the people of Taiwan. Beijing no longer is able to extend a hand of friendship to the people of Taiwan while slapping its leader in the face. It is increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people, while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese people who elected him.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan for several reasons. Democracy makes the government of Taiwan less predictable and harder to control, since it now must respond to the electorate's competing interests or be voted out of office. Democracy on Taiwan also increases the sympathy of the world's other advanced democracies for Taiwan. Moreover, Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan because it contrasts so strikingly with the leadership selection process on the mainland. In fact, it strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. What if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative?  The answer no longer can be that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Taiwan, democracy is also of great strategic importance. Fifteen years from now, Taiwan's hostile neighbor will be economically and militarily capable of dominating it, and possibly conquering it. Democracy is more important to Taiwan's strategic defense than any weapon system it could acquire. It makes Taiwan much more likely to draw support from the U.S. and other developed democracies in the event of any real threat from the mainland.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, though, democracy on Taiwan challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan. Reunification can take place only within a political system in which the government is responsive to the interests of the governed, not where the governed are beholden to the dictates of the government. By proving that democracy is possible and desirable in a Chinese society, Taiwan opens the door for Beijing to adopt such a system to protect the interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
<p>

<b>What Is At Stake</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At stake in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship is peace and stability in Asia. American interests in this relationship range from freedom of navigation on the high seas, to control of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, to the development of democracy and free enterprise in Chinese society, to access to the markets of America's sixth and seventh largest trading partners -- the PRC and the ROC, respectively. In order to best serve these interests, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<b><li>Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue.</b> For the Chinese themselves to resolve Taiwan issues, as posited in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqu‚, they must meet face to face to negotiate.<sup>3</sup>  Beijing suspended Taiwan's primary channel of communication with the mainland last July in response to Lee Teng-hui's visit to the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. should use its ability to communicate with Beijing to encourage Beijing and Taipei to restore this forum for the discussion of fundamental issues in cross-Strait relations.
<p.
<b><li>Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations.</b> Washington should lend its support to Taiwan's membership in international commercial and cultural organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria for membership in the WTO, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its entry, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<P>
<b><li>Urge Beijing to allow Taiwan to play an appropriate role in the international system.</b> Beijing must work with Taiwan to evolve an appropriate role for Taiwan in the international system. Taiwan is a separate, autonomous, and prosperous region which can and should play a role in international affairs. Taiwan is simply too large and important as a trading nation for either Beijing or Washington to ignore. Beijing must accept this reality. All international economic and cultural organizations, whether they technically require sovereignty or not, should be mutually agreeable. The successful examples of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) should be followed to allow both Beijing and Taipei to participate in international organizations.
<p>
<b><li>Sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, especially strategic missile defense.</b> Washington should continue to sell arms of a defensive nature to Taiwan in accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Given recent threats from Beijing, the U.S. should assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile defense system.
<P>
<b><li>Avoid linking MFN and Taiwan issues.</b> Washington should carefully consider the unintended consequences of any actions taken against China, such as revoking most-favored-nation trade status or applying unilateral sanctions, as they may indirectly harm Taiwan and Hong Kong, not to mention U.S. workers and consumers. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle rests are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the U.S. and other markets. Revoking MFN could cut Hong Kong's gross domestic product in half, deal a serious blow to Taiwan's economy, and jeopardize the 200,000 high-wage American jobs that depend on U.S. exports to China.
<p>
<b><li>Urge Taipei to avoid cross-Strait conflict and provocation.</b> Taipei must know that the U.S. wholeheartedly supports the efforts of the people of Taiwan to seek political and economic freedom and a greater role in world affairs. However, Taipei must understand that any unilateral action to determine the status of Taiwan, including a unilateral declaration of independence, is counter to the U.S. interest in peace and stability in Asia. Taipei must work with Washington and Beijing to ensure its security, and to protect its economic prosperity, by reasonably avoiding conflict and provocation.
<p>
<b><li>
Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement.</b> There is little chance of peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status if one party is negotiating with a gun pointed at its head. One possible way to defuse the tension could be for Taipei to pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time and for Beijing to respond by renouncing the use of force for that period of time. The U.S. could add credibility to a cross-Strait armistice agreement by endorsing it.
<p>
<b><li>
Engage in preventive diplomacy.</b> Beijing clearly misread the Taiwan electorate and miscalculated the international response toward China's missile diplomacy. To prevent such misunderstanding and miscalculation from occurring again, the U.S. must improve communication with Chinese leaders at the highest level. The U.S. should promptly and clearly inform Chinese leaders of the likely response Beijing's actions will provoke in a democracy where elected leaders must respond to constituent interests and public opinion. In Beijing a better understanding of America's democracy will help build stronger relations with the U.S. and the American people. Improved Sino-American relations are not only in the interest of China and the U.S., but of Taiwan as well.
</ul><p>


<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy. Despite a firestorm of military and rhetorical threats from Beijing, the electoral process in Taiwan functioned freely and fairly. Over 600 visiting journalists witnessed the triumph of democracy in Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election was truly an historic event. Leaders in Beijing, Taipei, and Washington now must assess the strategic implications of democracy on Taiwan. A new balance must be established in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship. Central to a new equilibrium must be a new international role for the Republic of China. This role should comport with Taiwan's standing as an economic powerhouse and mature democracy. Also central to the new balance should be an increased dialogue allowing Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to work out their differences. As they do so, both should accept not only the need for maintaining peace and stability, but also the fact that democracy now exists in the Republic of China on Taiwan.

<title>AFL-CIO To Impose New "Taxes" On Its Members - Heritage</title>

<h3>AFL-CIO TO IMPOSE NEW "TAXES" ON ITS MEMBERS</h3>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To increase its political muscle, the AFL-CIO has announced plans for two new union "taxes," including a more than one-third increase in per-member levies on constituent unions, to fund organized labor's 1996 partisan election activity. The new fees -- levied by the AFL-CIO on its members --  will finance the federation's previously announced $35 million campaign against the current Congress. This year alone, the additional income from these new charges will exceed $75 million for an organization whose annual budget was only $65 million last year. And despite the fact that 40 percent of union members voted Republican in the 1994 elections, the federation apparently intends to spend 100 percent of the new funds opposing GOP candidates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To put its 1996 political expenditures in perspective, the AFL-CIO expects to spend seven times its usual campaign budget and three times more than it has ever spent in any previous election year.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, when the $35 million budget is allocated among the 75 targeted districts -- predominantly Republican freshmen, according to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney -- the average per-district expenditure is $467,000. In the 1994 election cycle, by contrast, the average challenger spent $239,000. Moreover, the $35 million figure represents only the AFL-CIO's planned political activities. Individual unions within the federation, as well as unaffiliated unions, will likely conduct additional election efforts.
<p>

<b>36 Percent Increase to be Ratified at March 25 Convention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While meeting during the last week of February at a posh resort in Bal Harbour, Florida, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and his Executive Council decided to increase by more than one-third the fees it imposes on union members. Member unions currently are assessed 42 cents per member per month. The new assessment will increase this by 15 cents to 57 cents per member per month. It is expected that this will raise $25 million of the $35 million needed for the federation's 1996 political efforts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 25, 1996, the AFL-CIO will hold a special convention in Washington to ratify this extraordinary increase. (The Executive Council decided this new fee exceeded the amount they could approve on their own.) The intent of the new fundraising effort is clear:  AFL-CIO leaders plan to endorse President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the same meeting.

<p>
<b>AFL-CIO Cuts $375 Million Credit Card Deal</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As if a 36 percent increase in members' fees was not enough to finance the AFL-CIO's expensive 1996 political agenda, it also was announced in Bal Harbour that the federation had cut a new credit card deal. The AFL-CIO has an "affinity card" with the federation's logo that is marketed to union members by a bank. In return, a portion of the fees paid by union members for credit card use is paid to the federation. Under the terms of the new agreement with Household International, the AFL-CIO will receive at least $375 million in profits over the first five years, with a special $50 million signing bonus payable in the next few months.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the AFL-CIO has attempted to portray this new agreement as good for workers, the bank presumably could offer better terms to union members if the federation were not receiving such large payments. If a bank acting alone diverted credit card profits to other ventures, Sweeney and his allies no doubt would complain of "corporate greed."  When the AFL-CIO does the same thing to advance its own political ambitions, it apparently is virtuous.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the leadership of the AFL-CIO basked in the sun in Bal Harbour, Florida, they decided to impose two costly fee increases on its hardworking rank-and-file members. It is unfortunate that the federation's new leadership has placed such a strong and costly emphasis on partisan political gamesmanship. Just this year, over $75 million will be taken from rank-and-file union workers -- of varying political views -- to support the federation's endorsement of Bill Clinton and its campaign against congressional Republicans. These new union "taxes" will be used, in effect, to oppose real tax relief for all American workers.

<title>With Liberty and Justice For All - Heritage Lecture</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><b>Heritage Lecture No. 560 </b><p><h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and Educational Programs</a></h2><hr> <h3>With Liberty and Justice <I>For All</I></h3>

By Ward Connerly<br>
April 30, 1996
<p><blockquote>
<I>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</I>
</blockquote>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thirty-one words tightly compressed into one sentence, a sentence that is more universally known and more often repeated in America than any other.
<p>
<img src="lect560.gif" align=left alt="Ward Connerly with Dr. Matthew Spalding, Director, Lectures and Educational Programs"><caption><b>Ward Connerly with Heritage's Dr. Matthew Spalding</b></caption><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is hardly a day that passes that I do not recite that pledge -- in public or in private -- at least half a dozen times. How many hundreds of times has each of us recited those words?  Do we reflect on the meaning of the words embodied in that sentence, or is it like so many other things we say during the course of our days, giving little thought or commitment to what is meant?  "Have a nice day."  "Good to see you again."  Perfunctory words of life.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But this pledge is no ordinary sentence. It is a definition of American democracy and a constant reaffirmation of our dedication to the fundamental principles of that democracy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You flatter and honor me today by this opportunity to share what I believe is the significance of that pledge, to visit with you and discuss the meaning of American citizenship, America's passion for fairness, matters relating to that delicate subject of race, and why I believe the time is at hand for us to pursue a new course with regard to what we call "affirmative action."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When we become citizens of this nation, at birth or otherwise, we get a warranty. That warranty is supposed to honored by every government franchise in every village and hamlet of this nation. It is not transferable, and it is good for the life of the vehicle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We are guaranteed the right to vote; the right to due process; the right to be free, not to be enslaved, as long as we conduct ourselves in accordance with the laws of our nation; and the right to equal treatment under the law, regardless of our race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. These are rights which attach to us as individuals, not as members of a group.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This warranty has not always been honored for some of us. Because of the color of our skin or the place from whence we came, some of us were denied the right to vote; we were enslaved; we were denied due process; and the equal treatment granted to others was not ours to enjoy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In my lifetime, I can give testimony to America's meaner instincts and their consequences upon my life. To reflect upon this nation's past, with my racial background, it is tempting to mock that pledge, to devalue the warranty, and to be embittered by those who would urge me to forget the past. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One need only invoke a few memories to become enraged and to feel entitled to all of the preferences that can be presented:
<p><ul>
<li>Rosa Parks relegated to the back of the bus,
<p>
<li>Drinking fountains for "whites only,"
<p>
<li>Restrooms for "men," "women," and "colored,"
<p>
<li>George Wallace standing in the schoolhouse door saying "segregation now, segregation forever,"
<P>
<li>Images of black people being hosed in the streets simply because they demanded that the warranty be honored,
<p>
<li>And my thirty-year-old uncle being called "boy" by a ten-year-old white kid.
</ul> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because we were treated like animals, there are some who say "America owes us."  But the past is a ghost that can destroy our future. It is dangerous to dwell upon it. To focus on America's mistakes is to disregard its virtues. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This nation has a passion for fairness. That passion is evidenced in our Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, in executive orders, in court decisions. But most of all, it courses through the arteries of our culture. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is the centerpiece of virtually all of our religious faiths.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That great American pastime -- baseball -- is a reminder of the intensity of our passion for fairness as we exhort the crowd to "kill the umpire" if he makes what we consider an unfair call. As we drive home at the end of the day, our hands gripping the steering wheel, our bumper kissing the one ahead, when to our right a vehicle speeds along the curb and merges ahead of us at the moment when an opening appears, our passion for fairness surfaces. The protrusion of one of our fingers signals our belief that one of the rules of fairness has been violated. In every sport I can think of -- baseball, basketball, football, tennis -- one is expected to play between the white lines. To do otherwise is unfair and carries a penalty.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our passion for fairness seeps out of every pore of our existence. Great leaders understand that passion. In his early days, when members of his own church were urging him to "cool it," Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. appealed to America's sense of fairness and morality. It was Dr. King's appeal to fairness that resonated throughout the land and inspired Americans of all races and colors to travel to the deep South and to put their lives on the line in defense of what they considered the right thing, the fair thing to do.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action has its roots in that passion for fairness. When President Lyndon Johnson explained affirmative action to the nation, it is significant that he said, "You can't bring a man to the starting line who has been hobbled by chains and expect him to run the race competitively."  Fairness dictated that the nation pursue affirmative action to compensate black Americans for the wrong that had been done. Affirmative action was a technique for jump-starting the process of integrating black Americans into the fabric of American society, for changing the culture of America from an exclusive society into an inclusive one. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe affirmative action was meant to be temporary. It was meant to be a stronger dose of equal opportunity for individuals, and the prescription was intended to expire when the body politic had developed sufficient immunity to the virus of prejudice and discrimination. It was not meant to be a system of preferences that would harm innocent people. The rationale for affirmative action thirty years ago was a moral one. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Three decades later, affirmative action is permanent and firmly entrenched as a matter of public policy. It has its own constituency that is prepared to defend its continuation at any cost, not because of any moral imperative, but because it has become the battleground for a political and economic war that has racial self-interest as its centerpiece.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action, as most of us originally understood the term, enjoyed the support of a majority of Americans. Many Americans still support this concept as long as it does not involve preferences. Preferences, on the other hand, were wrong at the outset and are wrong today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Affirmative action has become a system of racial preferences in my state. Jobs are solicited with explicit acknowledgment that we want a woman or an African-American or a Hispanic for this position. Contracts are set aside for certain groups, with the taxpayers paying what amounts to an affirmative action tax. This is the result of contractors who set up shell minority and women-owned businesses to front for white-owned businesses in order to benefit from the minority set-asides.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Wealthy sons and daughters of underrepresented minorities receive extra points on their admissions applications to the university, based solely on their race, while higher-achieving Asians and whites from lower-income families are turned away from the university. Families are forced to mortgage their homes to send their children out of state to an institution comparable to Berkeley and UCLA. A racial matrix is used at most of our campuses which establishes a racial pecking order that distributes extra points on the basis of one's racial background.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When this nation began its use of affirmative action decades ago, America's racial landscape was rather clear. There was the dominant white majority and the oppressed black minority. Today, we have several dozen racial and ethnic categories in California. There is no dominant majority and there is no oppressed minority. Within a few years, the group which will numerically be the largest is Hispanic. Our racial tensions are no longer just black and white. They are black and Korean, black and Hispanic, white and Hispanic, Russian and Hispanic. Every conceivable racial conflict is present and lurking somewhere beneath the surface in California. How, then, do we decide who among us should receive a preference?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A direct product of our diversity is the emergence of a whole new set of racial configurations and problems which defy the old racial order. Yet affirmative action operates as if the old order was still in place, as if our racial dilemma was still black against white.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end of affirmative action will be difficult for black Americans. It is our nature not to be trusting of the goodwill of whites. It is instinctive for us to harbor the belief that our rights will only be as secure as the amount of ammunition issued to the federal troops to protect us. Well, it is time to let the troops go home and to place our faith in the American system of democracy, in America's passion for fairness. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 It is time for black Americans to enter the arena of democracy instead of seeing ourselves as spectators. <I>This</I> is our land, not Africa. The blood and sweat of black Americans can be found in the pot of democracy in just as great a quantity as that of others. It is time for black Americans to accept America proudly as their land, the land of opportunity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To black Americans, I say look through the windshield at America's opportunity, not through the rearview mirror at this nation's mistakes. Resist the temptation to believe that our nation owes us a debt. Let us take the initiative to say that the debt has been paid and the books are closed. And the Republican Party should say, "Come home to your party; you have been gone too long."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A significant phenomenon in my state is the growing political influence of Hispanics. As the emerging numerical majority, many Hispanics see affirmative action as their passport to college, jobs, and contracts. Many see affirmative action as a tool that has benefited black Americans, and they now believe it is their turn to be the preferred minority. They see it as the express lane to a better life. I urge them not to pursue this strategy. It is corrosive and dangerous. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am often asked why it is that California, one of the most multiracial states in the nation, is the first to begin the process of dismantling affirmative action. The answer is twofold: First, because California is a window of the future, we often experience events before other states. Second, it is precisely because of our diversity that we know how destructive affirmative action can be of fundamental democratic values of self-reliance, individualism, and equal opportunity for all.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
California is as close as any society on the face of the Earth to being that promised land where racism is considered repulsive and has no place. But this promised land can become a battle zone if we allow the continued tribalization of California.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can point with pride to the fact that the mayor of one of America's favorite cities, San Francisco, is a black man: Willie Brown. The mayor of one of the largest cities in the nation, Los Angeles, for years was a black man: Tom Bradley. Our two United States Senators are women. The mayor of our state capital is Hispanic: Joe Serna. Although I as a Republican don't always agree with the political judgment of my fellow Californians, I believe no one can dispute their egalitarian impulses. As one looks at <a href="http://www.ca.gov">California state government</a>, for example, the conclusion is inescapable: Equal opportunity is now inbred. The cabinet of Governor Wilson is nearly equally divided among men and women, and it only takes a casual meeting with any of them to confirm that raw talent, and not affirmative action, is the basis of that fact.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am terrified at the prospect of what can become of us if we maintain our existing preference policies. In police departments, in fire departments, in middle-class homes throughout California, there is a growing perception that if I am white, I and my kids will not have an equal opportunity to succeed. No matter where it comes from, if anyone among us believes the warranty is not being honored, we have a duty to investigate the legitimacy of their complaint and to make it right if their complaint is proven to be valid.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout this debate, you will hear about blacks being stopped in white neighborhoods, about white women clutching their purses as black men approach, about the difficulty of black men getting a taxi in urban centers late at night, about the glass ceiling, about the lack of role models, about the percentage of black males in prison, and about the shortage of women in the Congress. All of these complaints warrant our attention, but none of them, no matter how true, justifies a suspension of that warranty that I talked about.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are those who say that racism and sexism are not dead in America, and they are correct. But racism and sexism in our society do not justify our government giving a preference to Jose over Chang because Susan's father discriminated against Willie's father fifty years ago. Not in America.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If you are a student of history, you know that every now and then, the opportunity to alter the course of human events presents itself. Such is now the occasion for the people of this nation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every now and then, the challenge confronts us to step out from among the crowd to perform extraordinary acts. Such is the moment for the Republican Party.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge is to end the corrosive system of racial preferences that has evolved in our nation, a system that has the potential to fatally damage the most fundamental values of our democracy, and to do so in a way that does not unleash the meaner instincts of some and the fears of others. The opportunity is to resume that noble journey of building an inclusive family of Americans in which men and women of all races and colors can work and play in harmony, with mutual respect and expecting nothing more than an equal opportunity to compete, and from that competition to build that more perfect union of which our forefathers dreamed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vehicle for this journey is the California Civil Rights Initiative. This initiative is simple and direct: No government agency shall discriminate against anyone on the basis of race, sex, or national origin, and no government agency shall give anyone preferential treatment for any of those reasons.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two days ago, I appeared on a talk show with Congresswoman Maxine Waters. She argued that the California Civil Rights Initiative will create divisiveness. That may be true, but we are not the ones creating the divisiveness. Those who cling to the notion that preferences must continue are the ones responsible for dividing our society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the student who works hard for four years to earn a 4.0 grade point average only to be denied admission to Berkeley or UCLA in favor of someone with a 3.0, merely because UC wants racial diversity, whether she thinks we are being divisive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the poor Vietnamese student who is turned away from Berkeley or Irvine, despite his high grades, in favor of a wealthy underrepresented minority whether he thinks we are being divisive. Ask him whether he is satisfied with the explanation that we are getting too many Asians at those campuses.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the daughter of a third-generation Chinese-American family whether she thinks we are being divisive when we say that it is unfair for applicants who are in this country illegally to get a preference over her.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the parents of James Cook, one of only two California students admitted to Johns Hopkins University in 1994 only to be denied admission to UC San Diego medical school because he is white, whether they think we are being divisive. Ask them and thousands of other middle-class families, who are forced to take out $80,000 to $100,000 second mortgages on their homes to send their kids out of state to college because racial preferences prevent them from being able to attend UC, whether they think we are being divisive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ask the high-achieving black or Chicano student who works hard and gains entry to college solely on the basis of his merit, but who then must endure the nagging question of whether he was admitted because of affirmative action, whether he thinks we are being divisive. Ask him whether he thinks it's fair that his accomplishments are devalued.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Do we not believe it was divisive when those from an earlier period said that slavery is immoral and should be ended?  Was it not divisive when our nation's people fought among themselves over this very issue?  Was it not divisive when we sent troops into Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, to protect the rights of people like Rosa Parks and James Meredith to ensure their right to sit wherever they wanted on the bus and to attend a college that wasn't segregated?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, those were divisive times. But the seeds of division are planted not by those of us who seek to eliminate racial and ethnic preferences; they are planted by those who believe that our skin color and gender and how we spell our last name should entitle us to the harvest of diversity -- college admission, government employment, and contracts. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friend and ally throughout this experience has been <a href="http://www.ca.gov/gov/governor.html">Governor Pete Wilson</a>. When I first brought the fact to him that the University of California was engaged in an offensive system of racial preferences, the governor unhesitatingly said, "Let's fix it."  When our opponents accuse us of being divisive, the governor is correct when he says that sometimes the only way to resolve issues in a democracy is through the ballot box. That is why this initiative is so important.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I find it interesting that a nation which claims to have the heart to solve an ethnic war in Bosnia shouldn't have the stomach to prevent one here at home. If there is any lesson that we can learn from the rest of the world, it is that America's experiment with democracy will fail if we divide our people into racial enclaves and allocate jobs, contracts, and college educations on the basis of group identity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We often hear about the "angry white male."  If anyone is discriminated against because of his or her color, they have a right to be angry. And we should all share that anger, not belittle or rationalize it by citing glass ceiling statistics. As individuals, none of our rights are secure when the fruits of our society are allocated on the basis of group allotments.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yogi Berra once said, "When you reach a fork in the road, take it."  Well, try as we might, we can't take his advice. We must make a conscious choice. We can continue down the path of numerical parity, racial preferences, and a continuing preoccupation with the concept of race. We can continue perpetuating the outdated premise on which racial preferences are based: that blacks, women, and other minorities are incapable of competing without a handicap. Or we can return to the fundamentals of our democracy: the supremacy of the individual, equal opportunity for the individual, and zero tolerance for discrimination.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As a Republican, I want my party to be known not just as the party that eliminated the deficit and concerned itself with the fiscal health of our nation. I want us to be remembered as the party that stood fast in support of the proposition that racial preferences are a social deficit that has to be eliminated, that true equality of opportunity cannot be compromised, that the next generation should not have to inherit the task of solving the horrible problems that affirmative action is creating. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am not worried about the skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Aryan Nation. In our time, we have discredited them and their brand of racism. Now we must fight those who, in their own way, peddle a form of racism and bigotry that is just as destructive of democratic principles as the bigots of yesteryear.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You know, it pains me to say that within the past year, I have experienced more hate from my fellow black Americans than I have seen in the previous 55 1/2 years of my life. For example, a black state senator, Diane Watson, recently said that I want to be white, that I consider myself colorless, that I have no racial pride -- all because my wife is white and because I oppose racial discrimination and racial preferences.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The one thing that I have learned from this experience is that bigots come in all shapes and colors. Despite their physical differences, they have one thing in common; they all reside in the same intellectual sewer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The senator is right about several things. First, I do want to be colorless in the eyes of my government. I thought that was a goal to which we all subscribed. Second, I am lacking in racial pride. I have self-pride. I am proud to be an American. I am proud to be a Rotarian. I am proud of my family. I am proud to own my own business. But I am racially indifferent, not racially proud.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Those who proclaim pride in their color or race trouble me, unless they have earned that color lying on the beach or in front of a sun lamp. To any of you who want to travel down that road of racial pride, leave me out of the vehicle. But I urge you to be attentive for those signs which read, "slippery road ahead."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And so, my friends, we find ourselves poised at this moment in the life of a great people, trying to define the character of our nation. Throughout America, we are restructuring our institutions. Our nation is desperately trying to embrace policies which place greater reliance on the rights and responsibilities of individuals. The debate about affirmative action must be seen in that context.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This issue will define the political parties in our nation for generations to come. The challenge for Republicans will be to convince all Americans that preferences are not in the national best interest, that a preference for some means a loss of liberty and the pursuit of happiness for others. We have to convince black Americans, a group which has become addicted to the drug of a powerful central government, that their rights can be no more secure than anyone else's when we empower government to make decisions about people's lives on the basis of a government melanometer which measures melanin levels. None of our rights are secure in a game of racial self-interest.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I will never abandon my faith that America can become Ronald Reagan's "shining city on the hill," a society in which a person's gender or race or ethnic background are irrelevant in the transactions of their government. Let us not mourn the death of affirmative action. Instead, let us proclaim our belief that the spirit of equal opportunity, which affirmative action engendered, has become a permanent feature of America's social, economic, and political landscape. Let us have faith in our own sense of fair play.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On February 27, 1860, in his Cooper Institute address, President Lincoln urged his party to hold fast to their beliefs: "neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government, nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why do I take the position I have?  Because it is my duty as an American citizen.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am often asked if I would do it over again, knowing what I know now about the loss of privacy, the personal insults, and the occasional negative stories. My response is: "in a heartbeat."  This is the price of citizenship in a democracy. This is the fee which democracy exacts from each of us. If you don't have the courage of your convictions, then you forfeit the best that a democracy has to offer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Please indulge me in this moment of personal pride, as a citizen who has no political aspirations, who derives no economic benefit from this effort, in sharing with you the fact that I have taken the best blows that the opposition has been able to deliver, and I am still in the ring and on my feet.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it too presumptuous of me to say that one person can indeed make a difference?  Is it too naive of me to consider my experience as a reassurance that democracy works, that the republic for which it stands is a value worthy of our aspirations and dedication?  Is it wrong for me to think that the Pledge of Allegiance obligates me to believe and act upon my belief that the pursuit of liberty and justice for all is a duty for all of us?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I hope you will agree with me that those propositions are not presumptuous and naive.

<h3>Beyond Rhetoric: A Renewed U.S. Commitment To Hemispheric Free Trade</h3>

By Cresencio Arcos<br>
April 8, 1996

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Italian adventurer Amerigo Vespucci landed on the eastern coast of South America, he never could have imagined that the entire Hemisphere one day would carry his name. Nor could he have envisioned what we see today -- that after 500 years of starkly different histories among its many nations, the Hemisphere finally may be finding a common future. There is, however, no guarantee that Vespucci's Americas will realize their full potential. In fact, it is more accurate to say there are far more roadblocks ahead of us than those we have already cleared away. History may well look back on the '90s in the Americas as a decade of opportunities lost. I strongly hope this is not the case, but recent events do not engender confidence that we are well on the road to a robust commercial and economic integration of the Americas. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This is all the more frustrating given that the U.S. has the power and the influence, if it wishes to use them, to be a force for positive change in the Americas. Our market dwarfs all others in the Hemisphere, and is arguably more open than any other country's, with perhaps the exception of Chile's in some areas. This huge U.S. market is extremely attractive to Latin American countries and can give us enormous leverage in opening markets in the region. However, we are on the verge of losing this strategic advantage by shirking our role as the natural leader in promoting economic liberalization.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It does not have to be this way. There is still time for the U.S. to alter its course and reassert itself. But in order for us to do that, we must take an honest look at what has gone wrong and how to fix it. First, a look at what has gone wrong. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Contrary to the many accounts that the vision of the Summit of the Americas (in reference to the Hemispheric Summit in Miami in 1994) is being fulfilled, the Hemispheric trade agenda is in a holding pattern. That nothing of tremendous substance came out of the Cartagena meetings should be of no surprise. In fact, that they even agreed to meet again next year to continue the dialogue should give us great cause to celebrate. There are several reasons why the Hemispheric trade agenda at this moment appears to be a rudderless ship, being pulled here and there by the daily tides: the peso crisis in Mexico, election year politics in the U.S., and the increased influence of Brazil in promoting a Hemispheric trade regime different from the NAFTA.
<p>
<b>U.S. RETREAT AFTER NAFTA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Coming off an all-time high from the negotiation and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we perhaps overlooked the fact that there would be bumps in the road and occasional setbacks. So when the peso crisis hit Mexico in December 1994, the free trade opponents like Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan said it only showed that they were right all along -- Mexico was just waiting to trick the U.S. into signing the NAFTA so it could devalue the peso and flood the U.S. with Mexican goods. Of course, it didn't show that at all. In fact, without a NAFTA the U.S. would have seen its exports to Mexico drop by over 50 percent, like it did in 1982 when Mexico devalued, instead of the 17 percent drop we experienced last year. But the Perot/Buchanan accusations were superficially appealing, and so they stuck, and politicians in the U.S. began to worry about coming out too strongly in favor of trade in the Americas. Then the economic situation in Mexico deteriorated rapidly and the U.S. came to their aid as the leader of a $48 billion loan guarantee package. This had the unintended consequence of splitting the free trade coalition in Congress (many of the supporters of the NAFTA were opposed to the loan guarantees), and placing the Clinton Administration in the unenviable position of defending the loan guarantees during an election year in which the vast majority of Americans opposed the loan package. From that time forward it was apparent that we would see little if any action from Congress or the White House to advance the FTAA until after the elections, in 1997. When the election cycle kicked into high gear several months ago, it became even more apparent that free trade would be under attack when Pat Buchanan made trade the focus of his political campaign. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With the U.S. stepping back, a political vacuum was created in the Hemisphere. This vacuum has now been partially filled by the ascendance of the Brazilians, who favor a "go slow" approach to an FTAA. They believe that NAFTA-styled free trade would hurt Latin American countries, and instead have proposed a South American free trade agreement first, which would then be able to negotiate with the U.S. on much more so-called favorable terms. I say so-called favorable, because that type of a trading regime most likely would not be favorable to U.S. businesses, nor do I believe it would be favorable to South American economies in the long run. It would, however, most likely be favorable to the economic interests of the status quo that I will describe later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, as much as I am worried about the Brazilian initiative, I am far more troubled by the lack of U.S. leadership. After all, we are the ones holding most of the cards, and we cannot blame the Brazilians for pursuing their own interests once we have stepped back from the table. And although U.S. retrenchment may be understandable given our domestic political situation, we must realize this carries a price: namely, that Latin American countries will not unilaterally open their markets without reciprocity from the U.S. Ironically, the "opening" the U.S. needs to make is rather minor, given our already low tariffs and non-tariff barriers. But without providing a secure market for Latin American goods under a NAFTA-styled trade agreement, we will not be able to wrest political concessions from our Hemispheric trading partners. Why?  Because the commercial status quo is so hard to change. We only need to look at our own textile or agricultural industry to be convinced of that. 
<p>
<b>THE POLITICAL NATURE OF TRADE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Let's be honest, free trade is not good for everyone. It is not good for monopolies and it is not good for those seeking special favors or protections through government laws or regulators. Just to give you one example from my own industry. Up until just a few years ago, most local, long distance, and international telephone services in foreign countries were owned by government monopolies. In several countries in Latin America that still is the case. These monopolies produce poor service at high prices and reap windfall profits for doing so. In contrast, in Chile today telecommunications service is good, prices are down, and competition flourishes. In Argentina, competition in local service has also increased service, while its monopoly service for international long distance continues to keep prices well above market rates. So why don't the other Latin American countries quickly adopt the Chilean model?  Because there is more money to be made, and more political interests to be protected, by keeping things as they are. This rule works in Argentina and Mexico just like it works here in the U.S. In other words, although global competition may encourage market liberalization, the decision to open markets or keep them closed ultimately is a political one.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is neither good nor bad that market liberalization depends on politics. It is only bad when we fail to realize trade in this political context, and then wonder why our policies are ineffective. In other words, leaders in Latin America cannot place some of their protected industries in jeopardy under a free trade pact unless they can at the same time provide their competitive industries with access to our markets. The same political dynamic applied to President Clinton and Bob Dole when they sought passage of NAFTA. So if our agenda to create an FTAA by 2005 is seen in Latin America as harming more political and commercial interests than it helps, it will most likely be unacceptable. This is what is happening now. As Latin American politicians have come to believe we will not provide them the political cover they need -- consistent entry into the world's largest market through accession to NAFTA -- they have either postponed or withdrawn plans to make concessions to open their markets to our products and businesses.
<p>
<b>FOUR KEY AREAS OF U.S. TRADE POLICY </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Assuming we can once again commit ourselves to this agenda, there are four areas on which we need to focus our efforts as we attempt to create an FTAA. They are: 1) intellectual property rights, 2) procurement, 3) competition policy, and 4) services, and a fifth issue that covers all of them -- transparency. Let me describe the challenges we at AT&T and U.S. businesses face in each area. 
<p>
<b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although most of the debate of IPR has centered on the pharmaceutical company, there is much more at stake. Lax or nonexistent enforcement of intellectual property rights robs U.S. businesses of billions of dollars worldwide. The growing U.S. software and entertainment industries and what could be termed its emerging "information-based" industries are not protected in many Latin American countries. Although some Latin American countries believe they are benefiting from this lax enforcement, they are undermining a respect for property rights in general, and that will ultimately undermine the growth of their own nascent technology-based industries.
<p>
<b>Procurement</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Procurement of government services plays a much larger role in Latin American economies than it does in the U.S., with some Latin American governments controlling directly or indirectly the majority of the spending power in the country. And although the issue of procurement in the trade arena has generally dealt with how government contracts would be awarded, the telecommunications industry is particularly interested in a broader definition. The telecommunications industry is such a highly regulated field that its very existence depends on a clear and concise regulatory regime in the awarding of government contracts -- that is, in the awarding of concessions for the right to provide a wide range of telecommunications services. Our trade negotiators must attempt to remove any barriers that would prevent U.S. businesses from getting a fair chance in bidding on these "contracts." 
<p>
<b>Services</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The services industry in the U.S. employs far more workers than any other sector of the economy. And a larger percentage of our exports are now in services. Over 20 percent of exports to Latin America are in services, and that number would be much higher if we were provided all the protections our industries are provided here in the U.S. In Latin America many services industries, like telecommunications and financial services, still are considered "strategic," and as such are controlled by the government. In many Latin American countries, foreign investment is limited to a minority stake. For example, Brazil is liberalizing its telecommunications industry by allowing competition in cellular phone services. However, it is limiting foreign investment in those projects to 49 percent. If it maintains that restriction, it will limit the ability of AT&T and other U.S. companies to invest; but it will also limit the ability of the Brazilians to have the most advanced and well capitalized telecommunications system available. Lifting all restrictions on foreign investment would truly be a win/win proposition for both parties. A Brazilian official recently mentioned that his government might change this limitation. This is encouraging, and we hope the changes are made, but the U.S. would be in a much better position to influence the outcome if it were actively engaged in the process. 
<p>
<b>Competition Policy</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Competition policy is perhaps the most important area of interest. It was finally included as a legitimate subject of inquiry at Cartagena, when a working group was formed to study its implications. Broadly defined, competition policy is a set of principles that will foster competition at the local as well as international level. One of those principles is the creation and protection of long-term property rights, including contract rights. This requires a judicial process where contracts are respected and enforced. Contracts that extend beyond a five-year period are rare in Latin America, and you will hardly ever find contracts beyond ten years. This is mainly because businesses and people in the region have little confidence that their governments will respect property rights over the long term. In the case of AT&T, we have had an ongoing problem with contractual obligations we have entered into with various government or private sector monopoly phone companies. In international telecommunications, calls traditionally have been delivered by international carriers, like AT&T, which must hand off telephone traffic to the monopoly carrier in the foreign country. The payments regime for these "hand-offs" is known as the accounting rates process. Historically, accounting rates have not reflected market rates, with monopoly foreign carriers reaping windfall profits. AT&T and other U.S. foreign carriers are in the process of renegotiating contracts with these foreign carriers to get these rates down, but many of these carriers use their monopoly position to violate their contract rights or discriminate against U.S. carriers in violation of prior agreements. We should include strong provisions for the respect for property rights and the adjudication of property rights disputes in any trade agreement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Another aspect of competition policy deals with the elimination of monopolies. In the case of accounting rates, monopoly carriers have the power to reduce the profitability of AT&T and other U.S. carriers, and thus the ability of our companies to create wealth and jobs here in America. Monopoly foreign telecommunications carriers also raise the prices for U.S. customers who end up subsidizing the programs of the foreign monopolies, such as lower domestic rates in the foreign country. The result is often poor quality and limited services for both U.S. and Latin American customers. U.S. carriers must pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually in settlement payments to these Latin American carriers, with few benefits flowing to the customer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As liberalization occurs in Latin America, competition policy will play an even larger role as the regulatory issues become more complicated and subtle. The telecommunications industry is a perfect example of this. As foreign governments allow competition in international long distance, the big issue now is how will the costs for interconnection into the local network be decided. In Mexico, we see this very process going on today. AT&T and the other international carriers are preparing to enter the Mexican long distance market. We are asking to interconnect with the local monopoly at what we believe is a cost-based rate. However, there is a great disparity between what the long distance carriers believe is a cost-based rate and the current position of the telephone monopoly. We obviously don't agree on what the rate should be at this time, but that is why competition policy becomes so important. As markets are liberalized, businesses become ever more susceptible to market pricing, and so our cost structure must realistically reflect what the market demands. AT&T CEO Bob Allen has taken some harsh criticism recently about his decision to lay off thousands of workers in what people are describing as heartless and unnecessary. But as economist and <I>Washington Post</I> writer James Glassman said recently, AT&T must change because it cannot survive with its old monopolistic structure -- it is no longer a monopoly. We fight for market share on a daily basis against companies like MCI and Sprint that continue to grow. As competition in telecommunications increased here in the U.S., it became imperative to operate the company on a cost-based structure. In fact, critics five years from now may well say the restructuring was not radical enough. Consequently, since most U.S. businesses work under these exacting conditions of the market, we must insist that equal competition exists in the countries with which we will be trading under an FTAA. So our trade negotiators must insist on including mechanisms in any future FTAA
 that will limit the discretion of governments to impose political criteria on what needs to be a cost-based, market-driven process. In this particular case, that would mean establishing a clear set of rules and standards for cost-based interconnection fees. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To show how active U.S. engagement can make a difference in this particular area, we can look to Mexico. Because of our close relationship with Mexico through NAFTA, Mexico has recently announced it will follow an FCC-styled bidding process for the allocation of PCS services throughout Mexico. This process establishes a clear set of rules and procedures for bidding, and requires an open process.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is one other area that tends to influence all commercial activities in Latin America, but does not clearly fit into any of the categories above. That is the issue of transparency. Until all government decisions are open to public scrutiny there will always be room for corruption and behind-the-scenes deals. This environment may help a select few businesses with the right connections, but it harms the economy overall and it is extremely inefficient because it injects uncertainty into the commercial transaction. This way of doing business has serious costs for U.S. businesses. The Department of Commerce recently concluded that since 1994 there have been over 100 instances of foreign firms using bribery to undercut U.S. firms' efforts to win international contracts worth roughly $45 billion. Foreign firms that bribe win bids approximately 80 percent of the time. U.S. trade negotiators must establish clear and concise rules of commercial conduct when governments are involved, and we must insist on opening up the process to public scrutiny. 
<p>
<b>REVIVING THE TRADE AGENDA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So how do we bring about these very difficult changes in Latin America?  We do it through active and aggressive engagement. We do it by showing the American people why we need Hemispheric free trade to remain internationally competitive. We do it by showing how free trade can be a win/win for those who are not seeking special favors from governments. We don't do it by folding our hands and talking a good line about how everyone wins under free trade. We don't do it by failing to reward those countries, like Chile, that have done their utmost to open their markets. Chile is the crown jewel of Latin America. Many sectors of its economy are more open than ours. Its international telecommunications industry is so competitive, there have been times this year when it was cheaper to call from New York to Santiago, than from New York to Los Angeles. It has a strong democracy and a flourishing middle class. What kind of message do we send to the rest of Latin America when we fail to even engage Chile in negotiations? 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

What happened in Cartagena was inevitable given the direction of our current trade policy. But that direction can be altered with sufficient political will. One thing is certain. Good intentions by the U.S. are not enough. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

I met with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in Nicaragua last week. I believe he is committed to free trade in the Americas, as is U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, but personal commitment is not enough. The forces against Hemispheric integration are simply too strong. And much more is at stake here than Hemispheric integration. U.S. global leadership rests on our ability to create a trading model at home, that we can then export to the rest of the world. Imagine how much more influence we would have with our Asian trading partners if we had just concluded a Hemisphere-wide, comprehensive, NAFTA-style FTAA?  The benefits would be enormous for U.S. businesses and the world economy as a whole.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But the reality today is that our trade agenda is still in a holding pattern. I sincerely hope we can remove the obstacles from the runway before we run out of gas.

<title>Eight Good Reasons to Continue MFN for China - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>EIGHT GOOD REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 449<br>
April 30, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent crisis in the Taiwan Strait has reignited the annual debate over whether to continue China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status. As the debate heats up, Washington policymakers should consider carefully the reasons why continuing MFN for China serves U.S. interests. While granting MFN status does not solve all of America's problems with China, revoking it causes more problems than it solves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are eight prinipal reasons why Congress should approve an extension of MFN status for China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #1:</b> Revoking MFN will harm those America wants to help. Discontinuing MFN status for China would harm U.S. workers. The U.S. exported over $12 billion of goods and services to China in 1995, and American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #2:</b> Revoking MFN would threaten U.S. business and investment. The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated that China will require nearly $750 billion in new investments to fund new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies should be getting the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment. The result will be American jobs lost to competitors overseas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #3:</b> Revoking MFN would jeopardize economic reform in China. The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of one quarter of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to encourage the further opening of China's economy and society. To be sure, MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but at least it keeps China open to influences and pressures from the outside world.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #4:</b> Revoking MFN would harm the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong. The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong is heavily dependent on investment and export production in China. Abandoning MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. It also would harm Taiwan's economy. Billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by current tensions with China. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by countries the U.S. seeks to support -- Hong Kong and Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #5:</b> Revoking MFN will not improve human rights conditions in China. History shows that China is far more oppressive against its people when isolated from the outside world. This was clearly the case during the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #6:</b> Revoking MFN will not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction. China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The MTCR monitors and controls missile components and capabilities, while the NPT is a framework for control and reduction of nuclear weapons. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan and criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to such unstable regimes as those in Pakistan and Iran. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. The U.S. must investigate the recent allegations of missile sales to Pakistan, and it has every right to ask China to explain itself. If such sales have taken place, American law dictates that technology and commercial sanctions be imposed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be specific and targeted on the responsible Chinese enterprise, to avoid jeopardizing unrelated U.S. activities in China, rather than targeted on all U.S.-financed projects in China, as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial transaction with China. In this area, MFN is simply the wrong tool.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #7:</b> MFN is not special treatment. MFN trade status is a fundamental principle on which the World Trade Organization operates. The WTO is the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. MFN is the normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries. In the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, it is the foundation of basic international commercial relations. Discontinuing MFN to China is tantamount to imposing trade sanctions on China. Such sanctions should be imposed only when a country poses a special threat to American security. As difficult as China now is, it does not present such a threat.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #8:</b> Revoking MFN would set the U.S. on the road to confrontation with China. Abandoning MFN for China would lead to Beijing's isolation, making it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States and its allies to deal effectively with nuclear weapons proliferation, unfair trade practices, and human rights violations, China must be engaged, not an enemy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even though the U.S. should continue MFN trade status for China, however, it should not ignore Beijing's recent bellicose actions against Taiwan. To demonstrate displeasure with Beijing's missile diplomacy against Taiwan, and to reward Taiwan once it meets economic criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization, the U.S. should expedite Taiwan's bid to join the WTO ahead of the PRC. In the past, China has insisted that the PRC should accede to the WTO ahead of, or at the same time as, Taiwan. The U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for Taiwan's entry into the WTO, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China, but it would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. Most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<title>What the New Farm Bill Will Mean to State Economies and Farmers - Heritage</title>

<a href="fyi98t1.gif">Table 1:</a> New Farm Law Increases Farmer Income, by state, Alabama-Montana<br>
<a href="fyi98t2.gif">Table 2:</a> New Farm Law Increases Farmer Income, by state, North Carolina-Wyoming 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The agriculture legislation recently enacted by Congress and signed into law (P.L. 104-127) by President Clinton marks the most dramatic change in U.S. farm policy since the current command-and-control programs were created during the Depression. Today's system of centrally planned commodity support programs, export subsidies, supply controls, acreage allotments, production quotas, and restrictions on trade imports holds back American farmers. This makes it impossible for them to benefit from the growing world market and denies farming-related industries the economic boost of higher farm production. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new legislation was based on bills first debated last year by Congress: the<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.2195:"> Freedom to Farm Act</a> (H.R. 2195), sponsored by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), and proposals advanced by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) during the consideration of balanced budget legislation. These bills called for sweeping changes in American agriculture policy to create freer markets, reduce subsidies, and generally permit farmers to run their businesses to take advantage of market opportunities rather than comply with bureaucratic regulations. The bills also were in line with calls for fundamental reform voiced by many farmers and research organizations, such as The Heritage Foundation. In <I>Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity</I>, Heritage analysts proposed last year that Congress immediately end all supply control programs, phase out subsidies, and end other restrictions on farmers.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
P.L. 104-127, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996, eliminates federal government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction programs. Farm subsidies for these crops are to be replaced by steadily decreasing, but fixed, "market transition" payments. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the FAIR Act failed to reform the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Allegedly an environmental program, the CRP actually has functioned more as a supply control program, more often than not paying farmers to take potentially productive land out of use. The CRP at least should have been reformed to allow farmers to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. The FAIR Act also failed to reform the sugar and peanut programs, which continue the archaic policy of restrictive allotments and quotas that gouge American consumers; nor did it eliminate the milk market orders which force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these shortcomings, the new farm legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous new opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of this restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. farm economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which would mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by Heritage Senior Fellow David Winston, using an econometric model of the agriculture economy developed last year by Heritage, the new law will mean:
<p><ul><b>
<li>Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li>Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<P>
<li>Taken together, the agriculture community as a whole thus will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion of income. 
</ul></b> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This increase in agriculture activity will have a "multiplier" effect on other industries, leading to a total economic boost to the nation of $74.6 billion between 1996 and 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The states in which farmers will be at least $1 billion better off over the next seven years are:

<h3>APPENDIX: <br>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION MODEL</h3>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage Foundation Farm Income Projection Model, described in detail in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, projects what would happen to future farm income (1996-2002) under the Freedom to Farm Act, based on historical analysis of the farm sector from 1990-1993. In our model we assumed that, overall, about 95 percent of ARP and 50/92 land would come back into production. These additional acres would yield only 95 percent as much as land currently being farmed, and costs of production would be 5 percent higher. For all cropland in our analysis, yields would increase 0.5 percent each year through 2002 due to productivity gains. Finally, we assumed that because of growing overseas demand, the increase in supply would have a minimal impact on prices. The greatest effect would be in 1996, when prices would drop 4 percent. By 2002 this loss would be more than recouped.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In keeping with estimates of the gain in farm income contained in Freeing America's Farmers, the Heritage Foundation's more comprehensive estimates of increased economic activity are conservative in their assumptions. In the model to estimate farm income gains, we assumed that future productivity gains would be only 0.5 percent annually and estimated relatively higher costs of production for new acreage relative to existing acreage. Thus, the model significantly understated potential income gains, and our conclusions about changes in farm income presented the worst case scenario, suggesting that some states would take much longer to become net farm income winners.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Some states would take longer because the model assumed that farmers would continue to grow whatever crops they previously produced or currently were producing and that production on new acreage would simply reflect their historical growing patterns, even when this would cause a loss of income. However, if allowed to produce for the marketplace rather than for the government, farmers would not use their acreage to produce any crop that resulted in a negative income. If there is no alternative crop available to generate a net profit from production on the new acreage, the farmer's rational decision would be to leave that land idle rather than produce a crop at a loss. Therefore, our model showed income losses for farmers when, at worst, there would have been no gain.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In estimating the additional economic activity generated by increases in farm income, we assumed that most, though not all, of the new product would be sold overseas to meet the growing demand for food in Africa and the Pacific Rim. While it is true that increased production could trigger faster development of new consumer products and new uses for the domestic market as well as for the international market, we estimate only the increase in economic activity that would be derived from increases in exports.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage analysis is based on the gross business multiplier of all agricultural exports developed by Gerald Schluter and William Edmondson of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Their multiplier factor is based on a recognition that "in a highly interrelated economy like that of the United States, many more people benefit from agricultural exports than just farmers and exporters and their employees."  Schluter and Edmondson point specifically to firms that provide materials and services used by farmers and others to provide the export goods as beneficiaries of increased economic activity that leads to business growth, in addition to businesses which sell consumer goods and find that customers spend more when trade expands.<sup>2</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of good economic news in recent months, many Americans are concerned about their economic security, stagnating family incomes, and less money in their paychecks after taxes. They have a sense the economy is performing below its full potential and do not accept President Clinton's claim that the economy is the "healthiest it has been in 30 years."<sup>1</sup> 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A comparison of the current economic expansion and the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months suggests that they are right. The economy is failing to perform as well as similar expansions, and over the past three years the job opportunities and real earnings of many Americans have declined.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the current recovery, for example:
<P><ul>
<li><b>The gross domestic product</b> has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.<sup>2</sup>  Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><b>Total employment</b> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li><b>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs</b> has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li><b>Real median family income</b> actually has declined 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average increase of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
<li><b>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers</b> have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an increase of 3.1 percent during the November 1982 to July 1990 expansion.<sup>4</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, the economy is experiencing modest growth, but other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for many Americans in recent years. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Since September 1993, real average hourly earnings have stagnated and real average weekly earnings have declined 1.5 percent.</b><sup>5</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.</b><sup>6</sup> Over the same period, real hourly compensation (combined wages and benefits) has not increased significantly.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs</b> in the 12 months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<li><b>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet.</b> In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<li><b>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.</b><sup>10</sup>  The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.
<p>
<li><b>From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.</b><sup>11</sup> From March 1991 to March 1995, the first four years of the current expansion, manufacturing employment slowly increased (52,000 total new jobs). Over the past year, however, it declined by 1.8 percent.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. Graded on a curve, the economy gets a "D" for below-average performance when compared with other expansions. It is not quite failing, but it clearly is not performing up to its potential.

<h3>BILL CLINTON AND JAPAN: GETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT</h3>

F.Y.I. 95<br>
April 11, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Bill Clinton will visit Japan on April 16-18 to meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The major purpose of his trip will be to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance. Challenges now facing both the United States and Japan in Asia, from tensions on the Korean Peninsula to China's increasingly aggressive conduct toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea, make a reaffirmation both timely and necessary. It is even more necessary because for the better part of the Administration's first two years, Bill Clinton's Japan policy has put this critical relationship at risk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration came into office committed to forging a new U.S.-Japan relationship. Its Japan policy, however, was based on a number of miscalculations. The first was that security issues could be de-emphasized in the U.S.-Japan relationship after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The second was the over-emphasis placed on reducing the bilateral trade deficit. Trade policy, originally viewed as but one part of an overall Japan strategy, quickly expanded in time and effort to become almost the entirety of the Administration's approach to Japan. In effect, Japan policy became an extension of the 1992 campaign theme, "Its the economy, Stupid."  Seeing Japan through a mid-1980s time warp as an immutable economic juggernaut, the Clinton team was committed to applying intense external pressure to get its way. The final miscalculation was that, in the post-Cold War world, this pressure could be applied with little collateral political damage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, the Administration was wrong across the board. Security in today's post-Soviet world remains important, as North Korea's quest for nuclear weaponry and China's aggressive behavior toward Taiwan have reminded Americans and Japanese alike. Moreover, Japan's economy was not immutable. By 1993, it was undergoing significant structural change, the result of a five-year recession brought on by the collapse of its wildly inflated late-1980s economy and a skyrocketing appreciation of its currency, the yen.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While in Tokyo, President Clinton will try to take credit not only for improved U.S.-Japan economic relations -- in particular, the reduction of America's trade deficit with Japan -- but for the improving security relationship as well. This will be credit not deserved. After damaging U.S.-Japan relations with the threat of a trade war, the President saw his mistake and corrected course. Better late than never. But solving a problem which the President himself caused is hardly the best way to conduct foreign policy.
<p>
<b>ECONOMICS IN COMMAND</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration got off on the wrong foot early in dealing with the Japanese. Downplaying the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance, the Administration quickly placed economics and trade at the top of its agenda with Tokyo. The centerpiece of its strategy was its New Economic Framework, a combination of economic and trade policies hastily cobbled together in Tokyo in July 1993. In effect, the New Economic Framework was an attempt to manage trade with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Through a series of negotiators the Clinton Administration attempted to pressure the Japanese government into accepting targets for American exports to Japan. The Framework negotiations essentially were geared to redeeming the President's promise to produce results in such politically sensitive sectors as computers, telecommunications, automobiles, and auto parts. Fearing that failure to meet such quotas would make Japan a target for trade sanctions, Tokyo refused to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

From the outset, the Framework talks were acrimonious, marked by a high degree of suspicion, mistrust, and unprecedented personal animosity. They did not improve with age. At the February 1994 summit between Bill Clinton and then-Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese found that they could and did say "no" to the Administration's demands for managed trade. By the spring of 1995, the Administration was poised for a trade war with Japan, threatening a 100 percent tariff on the import of Japanese luxury automobiles unless Tokyo relented and signed up for managed trade.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In both countries, the media duly reported on and expanded on the tactics and personalities of the negotiators and their countries. In both countries, the media retreated to familiar stereotypes -- the untrustworthy, scheming Japanese versus the unreasonable, demanding Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the end, trade agreements were signed but none contained enforceable quotas. Typical was the conclusion of the auto parts negotiations. Two days after insisting that the government of Japan had to be part of an agreement to guarantee compliance of Japanese auto companies, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was forced to back down. To underscore the extent of the Administration's retreat, the Japanese negotiator, Ryutaro Hashimoto, now Japan's Prime Minister, made clear at a joint press conference that Kantor was speaking solely for himself with regard to expectations for growth in American exports to Japan. The Japanese government, he emphasized, was not guaranteeing the deal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton set out to build a new U.S.-Japan relationship. But by placing economics at the center of his Japan policy, he short-changed the vital U.S.-Japan security relationship. And by resorting to threats of a trade war, the President caused a significant erosion in Japanese support for relations with the U.S. In short, his policies have been counterproductive for the strategic interests of the U.S.
<p>
<b>ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS AND JAPAN'S ECONOMIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration is claiming that its trade policies are responsible for the recent decline in Japan's trade surplus with the United States. This is political spin of the highest order and represents a striking example of the logical fallacy known as <I>post hoc ergo propter hoc</I> (literally, "after this, therefore because of this"). The root causes for this decline are to be found not in Washington, but in the impact of global economic forces operating on Japan. In reality, a substantial appreciation of the yen and high Japanese production costs are the main causes of America's declining trade deficit with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The major factor driving down Japan's trade surplus is the soaring value of the yen. In Japan, this is known as <I>endaka</I>, which means an increase in the value of the yen against other currencies. From 158 yen = $1 in April 1990, the yen appreciated to a high of 79 yen = $1 in April 1995. Today, it stands at approximately 108 yen = $1, still substantially higher than it was in 1990. The appreciation of the yen has had a double effect: While making Japanese exports more expensive, it also has made imports cheaper. And Japanese consumers have responded to market signals by buying more imports, including those from the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Imports began to surge in April 1993. Japan's imports climbed by 22.3 percent in 1995. Semiconductors and electronic devices went up 66.6 percent, while automobile imports grew by 40.6 percent. Meanwhile, internationally, Japan's now higher-priced exports grew more slowly, by 12.0 percent, while exports of American-bound automobiles actually fell by 13.9 percent.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The <I>endaka</I> also is causing Japanese manufacturers to restructure fundamentally the way they do business. Under unrelenting pressure to cut costs, Japanese firms are beginning to open their traditional clubby business networks, known as <I>keiretsu</I>, to foreign suppliers. American and other foreign venders are now aggressively marketing their components to Japanese firms.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, Delphi, a General Motors parts subsidiary, hired Nissan and Toyota executives who then persuaded their former employers to designate Delco batteries as "authorized" parts for automobiles made by these Japanese companies. Consequently, Nissan and Toyota dealers now stock Delco batteries. In another instance, Tenneco, a <I>Fortune</i> 500 corporation with interests in automotive parts, energy, packaging, and shipbuilding, recently reached agreements with Toyota and Japan Energy to carry U.S.-made Monroe and Rancho shock absorbers at Toyota's 5,000 affiliated garages and at Japan Energy's 6,000 gas stations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To stay competitive, Japanese manufacturing firms are closing plants in Japan and moving to lower-cost production sites in the United States, Britain, and Southeast Asia. For example, Toyota is now investing billions in new plants, not in Japan, but in the U.S., Britain, and Thailand. While shedding jobs in Japan, Fujitsu, a leading Japanese electronics manufacturer, is building semiconductor plants in Oregon and Britain. Increasingly, Japanese firms are supplying overseas markets through local production rather than exports. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) estimates that in 1995 the value of goods produced by Japanese companies overseas exceeded the value of their exports for the first time in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Moreover, "reverse imports" -- products made abroad by Japanese firms and then exported for sale to Japan -- are becoming common in America. For example, Honda is now a net exporter of motor vehicles to Japan. In 1995, Honda exported some 45,000 Accord coupe, Accord wagon, and Civic models from North America to Japan. In sum, cost-conscious Japanese corporate decisions, not U.S. government policy, are driving down Japan's trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

By attempting to manage trade through quotas or targets, the Administration's trade policy was playing directly against economic forces that are working to transform, open, and deregulate Japan's economy. Trade quotas, both to expand imports and to restrain exports, empower the Japanese bureaucracy to decide which firms must buy more of a targeted import and which firms must be prevented from making profitable sales overseas. Such an expansion of governmental control would reregulate rather than deregulate Japan's economy.
<p>
<b>POLITICAL COSTS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's trade war with Japan from 1993-1994 took a political toll on the U.S.-Japan relationship. According to polls conducted by the United States Information Agency in June 1995, during the auto and auto parts negotiations, 39 percent of Japanese respondents saw trade conflicts as eroding the alliance, while 30 percent saw the alliance as strong. By contrast, in May 1992, 43 percent saw the alliance as strong despite trade frictions. In the same June 1995 poll, 51 percent considered relations as "poor" and only 41 percent viewed them as "good."  In January 1996, 48 percent thought the relationship in "poor" shape.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Certainly, progress needs to made in opening and deregulating Japan's market. But, as the above polls make clear, the Administration's approach of using external pressure to force internal economic change in Japan has been counterproductive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Against this background, the rape of a twelve-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl by American servicemen last September triggered the most serious crisis in the U.S.-Japan security relationship in decades. Calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Okinawa dominated Japan's political public debate in October. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 With the Okinawa crisis still smoldering, the President did not help matters when he canceled his November state visit to Japan to deal with the budget battle in Washington. Shortly before that decision, Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, warned that cancellation would be a "body blow" to the alliance. In Tokyo, Japanese government officials noted that the cancellation was met with a dangerous indifference by the Japanese media and public, reflecting exasperation in dealing with the Clinton Administration. Shortly thereafter, the President in similar circumstances found time to visit Ireland and Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin. The Japanese media and political elite were quick to contrast the President's political priorities.
<p>
<b>ENDURING STRATEGIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Despite the end of the Cold War, the alliance with Japan remains critical to American national interests. Today, the U.S.-Japan Alliance is the centerpiece of Asia's security system and the foundation of its economic dynamism and prosperity. This is of direct and immediate consequence to the security and economic well-being of all Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As John Dori of The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center has pointed out, U.S. exports to Asia in 1994 grew at a rate of 16.2 percent to more than $153 billion, the steepest increase since 1988. The prosperous nations of the region purchased over $45 billion more from U.S. exporters than did the 15 nations of the European Union, and almost $30 million more than Europe as a whole. And exports to Asia mean jobs for Americans. In 1994 more than 3 million Americans owed their jobs to exports to Asia, with 428,000 jobs being created in 1994 alone.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The United States also has enduring strategic interests in Asia. For over a century, the U.S. has worked to prevent a single power from dominating the region. Today, America's alliance with Japan enhances its ability to keep Asia open to U.S. influence. Forward-deployed U.S. forces in Japan have helped to deter aggression against allies and friends in the region. Recognizing the importance of this U.S. presence to Japan's security, the government of Japan contributes close to $5 billion annually in support for U.S. forces stationed in that country. Japan's effort in this regard represents the most generous host nation support of any of America's allies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The strategic importance of the U.S. force presence in Japan was recently demonstrated. In mid-March, President Clinton ordered the deployment of the USS <I>Independence</I>, home-ported in Yokosuka, Japan, to waters near Taiwan at the time of the Republic of China's presidential elections. This strategic importance has also been evidenced by America's continuing ability to deter a possibly nuclear-armed North Korea from attacking South Korea, a U.S. ally, and reunifying the Korean Peninsula on communist terms. And a strong U.S.-Japan alliance will enhance America's ability to deal with China as it emerges as a great power in the first quarter of the next century.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton's Japan policy has ill served the relationship once defined by Ambassador Mike Mansfield as the United States' most important "bar none."  Were it not for the dedicated work of officials in the Pentagon, most notably Joseph Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, there is no telling how far the free-fall in the relationship would have taken the alliance. Fortunately, these officials recognized the damage being done by the Administration's trade tactics, and in 1994 began the long, arduous task of returning the Administration's focus to the strategic centrality of the alliance. This is what has brought Bill Clinton to Tokyo. Better late than never.

America's students still are not performing at a satisfactory level, and Americans are not getting a solid return on the investment of their tax dollars in the nation's schools, according to the latest assessment of achievement. After 15 years and $328 billion in federal spending, the U.S. <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a> is contributing little, if anything at all, to student success in reading.<sup>1</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The recently released findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) final 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States show most of America's students are not meeting a proficient achievement level in reading.<sup>2</sup>  The 1994 NAEP reading examination is the nation's report card in reading. The 1994 test was administered to nearly 140,000 students in public and private schools nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NAEP report reveals student reading and comprehension achievement levels in grades 4, 8, and 12 between 1992 and 1994, as well as achievement levels within various subgroups of the student population. The report uses three achievement levels to rank the results: basic, proficient, and advanced.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While 4th and 8th grade students showed slight declines in performance, there was a significant decline in the reading performance of students in grade 12 (see <a href="fyi94c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Between 1992 and 1994, notes the report:
<p><ul>
<li> There was a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the proficient level;<p>
<li> There was also a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the basic level; and<p>
<li> There was a significant increase in the percentage of twelfth graders performing <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regionally, the results were equally discouraging. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Every region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West) had significant declines in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>at or above</I> the proficient level; and<p>
<li> Every region had an increase in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 NAEP final report also accounted for the reading performance of six population subgroups: white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian.<sup>4</sup>  Consistent with previous NAEP reports, there were large differences in performance by race and ethnic subgroups (see <a href="fyi94c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). In nearly every ethnic and racial subgroup there were significant declines in reading performance. While there were significant decreases in the reading performance levels for white, black and Hispanic twelfth grade students, white students had the largest decreases. Fewer white twelfth graders in 1994 achieved at least <I>the basic level of reading performance</I> than achieved that level in 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Breaking down student performance by gender, the 1994 NAEP results show that female students generally outperformed male students in all three grade levels (see <a href="fyi94c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). According to the report: 
<p><ul>
<li> Between 1992 and 1994, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade males <I>at or above</I> both the proficient and basic levels. There was also a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade females <I>at or above</I> the basic level. There was also a significant increase in the number of male and female twelfth graders who performed at or below the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the most discouraging results are the differences in the performance levels between poor students participating in the Title I program, the Federal Education for the Disadvantaged program "(formerly called Chapter One)," and non-Title I participating students (see <a href="fyi94c5.gif">Chart 5</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Although there were no corresponding data on Title I participation for 1992, the 1994 results show that the low-income students enrolled in the Title I program are being left behind the rest of America's students. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Across all three grade levels, of those students participating in the Title I program, there were significantly fewer students performing <I>at or above each of the reading achievement levels.</I> 
<p>
<li> Of all students performing <I>at the below basic level</I>, Title I students are performing below the basic level at a larger proportion than non-Title I students. The percentages of Title I students who performed <I>below basic</I> ranged from 59 percent at twelfth grade to 80 percent at fourth grade.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Clinton's Secretary of Education, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/04-1995/naepwrd.html">Richard W. Riley</a>, argues that congressional efforts to dismantle the existing federal bureaucracy and channel funds back to the states, localities, teachers and parents would set back efforts to improve education.<sup>6</sup>  The results of the 1994 NAEP reading examination are yet another indicator that the current approach to education is not working. More money, more bureaucracy, more regulation, and more federal intrusion clearly are not improving America's academic performance.

<h3>NATO EXPANSION: MYTHS AND REALITIES</h3>

By  W. Bruce Weinrod<sup>1</sup>
<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Committee Brief No. 23
<br>
March 1, 1996<BR>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Momentum for the admission of new members into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is increasing. NATO may well invite
new members to join the alliance before the turn of the century.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The case for admitting new members to NATO is persuasive. An expanded
NATO will reinforce peace and freedom In Europe and thus will
support important U.S. interests and objectives. However, crucial
decisions related to NATO expansion have yet to be made. Little
information is available about the specifics of NATO expansion,
and U.S. public and congressional debate on whether NATO should
expand has just begun. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Examining the details of the NATO expansion process and its implications
for U.S. interests is both inevitable and necessary. Some critics
of NATO expansion have raised objections which are spurious, misleading,
or inaccurate; others have raised legitimate concerns which deserve
consideration. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the process of NATO expansion to be successful, the American
public and Congress will have to sort through the myths and realities
of the issue. NATO enlargement raises two broad and interrelated
sets of issues: whether NATO expansion as such is a good idea
and (assuming NATO expansion occurs) how the expansion process
can best proceed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>SHOULD NATO EXPAND?</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics suggest that there exist no real security threats justifying
an increased NATO membership. Therefore, the argument goes, there
is no reason to expand. But NATO expansion is important, not primarily
to defend against an imminent attack, but rather as a deterrent
against potential future security threats and an insurance policy
against uncertainties.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Bringing in new members would send a signal to any potential aggressor
that it would pay a substantial price for any expansionist ambitions
against nations which have become a part of the larger Western
community of nations. An expanded NATO also would reinforce the
post-World War II effort to envelop Germany in a broader European
framework and would make it highly unlikely that the region to
NATO's immediate east would emerge as an unstable geopolitical
vacuum between Germany and Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As it did for many Western European nations in the early post-World
War II years, NATO can reinforce the consolidation of free political
and economic institutions in the emerging but fragile democracies
of Central Europe. The alliance can do this by providing an overarching
security umbrella and a clear symbol that such nations are being
welcomed as part of the West.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In any event, while Western Europe is indeed safer and more secure
after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the rest of Europe contains
instabilities of concern. Most important, if a resurgent extreme
nationalist leadership in Russia were to appear, it would be easier
to deter if NATO already had formalized membership for nations
between Russia and Western Europe.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>&quot;New Lines&quot; and European Stability</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A major contention of critics of NATO expansion is that adding
members to NATO inevitably will create &quot;new lines&quot; of
instability in Europe between members and non-members. The argument
is that nations not invited to join NATO (it is generally assumed
that nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary would
be admitted first) would be discouraged and alienated from NATO
and the West. As a result, these uninvited nations might join
rival alliances or take other actions which would increase geopolitical
instability.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This will not necessarily happen. But in any event, the most important
new lines in Europe already have been created as a result of the
dissolution of the Soviet empire. Adding new members to NATO would
only reflect the new geopolitical realities demonstrated in the
preferences of many nations to NATO's east for close political,
economic, cultural, and security ties to the West<sup>3</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate NATO objective should be the ending of lines and
the extension of the free society throughout Europe. However,
from a Western security perspective, if dividing lines are to
exist in the near term, it is preferable that these lines be as
far to the east as practicable. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Concern has been expressed that admitting new members into NATO
will have a negative impact on Russia and its relationship to
the West. These critics note comments such as President Boris
Yeltsin's September 6, 1995, statement that NATO expansion &quot;would
plunge Europe into the flames of war&quot; and a remark by General
Alexander Lebed (a potential 1996 candidate for Russian President)
that it &quot;would mark the beginning of World War III.&quot;<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Overheated Russian rhetoric, however, should be kept in perspective.
Moscow has changed its position on important NATO-related issues:
After initial opposition, Russia acquiesced in NATO bombing in
Bosnia; and Russia joined the NATO Partnership for Peace (PFP)
after a lengthy period of hesitation. Further, there are forces
in Russia which view NATO expansion as a positive development
for Russia itself; and even among those opposed to NATO expansion,
there are many realists who understand, as the influential Council
for Foreign and Defense Policy puts it, that &quot;even in the
case of enlargement, the military threat is not likely to increase.&quot;<sup>5</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another argument is that NATO enlargement would undercut reform
forces in Russia and provide a catalyst for the advancement of
extreme authoritarian nationalist factions and their anti-Western
agenda. However, if authoritarian nationalists come to power again
in Russia, it will be due not to increased NATO membership, but
to more fundamental systemic factors inside Russia. For example,
the issue of NATO expansion was not even a marginal reason for
the strong showing of Communist and other anti-Western factions
in the December 1995 Russian Parliamentary elections. The reality
is that the issue of NATO expansion can have only a marginal effect
on whether democracy prevails in post-Communist Russia and on
Moscow's international role.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If authoritarian nationalists take power, their attitude towards
the West will not be shaped primarily by whether NATO expands.
For such ideologues, the West is the adversary not because of
what it does, but because of what it is and what it stands for.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some critics oppose NATO's enlargement now but suggest that expansion
could be appropriate if and when Russia posed a renewed threat
to the West. However, expanding NATO when no threat exists would
be a much smoother and more positive action because enlargement
in the context of a reassertive Russia inevitably would be criticized
as &quot;destabilizing&quot; or &quot;provocative.&quot;  Further,
it would prove more difficult for NATO members to agree on enlargement
should Russia be seen as a renewed threat.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A democratic Russia should accept NATO enlargement for two principal
reasons: first, it will encourage the consolidation of democracy
in neighboring nations, which in turn will reinforce democracy
in Russia; and second, it will make unlikely the kind of regional
instability to Russia's west which would divert attention away
from domestic reform.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The West, sensibly, is treating Russia constructively as it did
Germany after World War II, rather than vindictively as it did
after World War I. It is up to Russia to respond positively to
that wise policy. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Security Obligations and Cohesiveness</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics of NATO expansion suggest that by taking on new security
commitments, NATO may be drawn into numerous ethnic or other sub-regional
disputes. NATO need not make this a primary mission. NATO can
avoid such an outcome by constraining the ability of newly admitted
members to draw NATO into localized disputes, and by developing
clear criteria for the use of military force.<sup>6</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has been argued that should NATO grow, its cohesion and sense
of common purpose inevitably will dissipate; that a larger NATO,
exacerbated by significant cultural and geopolitical differences,
will become unmanageable; and that reaching agreement between
new and old members on important issues will prove difficult<sup>7</sup>.
 But while increasing an organization's size may present challenges
to cohesiveness, NATO's experience with past enlargement is instructive.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, when NATO's membership was being decided in the late
1940s, the original European members initially rebuffed U.S. efforts
to include Norway, Iceland, and Portugal out of concern that these
nations were geographically too distant, and that Iceland and
Portugal's &quot;Europeanness&quot; was questionable. Later, some
European NATO members initially opposed admitting Greece and Turkey
because they were &quot;distant geographically and culturally
from the West.&quot;<sup>8</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These and similar concerns have proved groundless. Despite sharp
policy differences which have arisen occasionally over the years,
NATO in fact developed a real sense of cohesiveness which has
enabled it to develop a consensus on actions ranging from the
deployment of nuclear-armed missiles in Europe during the 1980s
to active cooperation with the international response to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait to the deployment of a multinational force
in the former Yugoslavia. This cohesiveness reflects the emergence
of a common democratic security culture among NATO nations which
has enabled even traditional rivals Turkey and Greece to work
together, albeit uncomfortably at times, for common NATO objectives.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's new structure allows for some difference of perspective
among members, since the alliance already is developing mechanisms
which would allow a sub-group of NATO members to take military
action. Nonetheless, NATO may need to consider procedural mechanisms,
at least for a transitional period, to provide assurance that
new members cannot block important NATO decisions<sup>9</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Enlargement inevitably will bring new perspectives into NATO.
But the significant benefits of expansion, including the expansion
of the common democratic security culture eastward, easily can
outweigh the inevitable disagreements which will occur.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Implications for Military Effectiveness</b> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It also has been suggested that adding members could dilute NATO's
military effectiveness. Enlarging NATO obviously would raise challenges
for NATO's military structure and capabilities. Even at NATO's
current size, assuring effective military coordination among different
military forces requires considerable effort. Issues which the
alliance will need to address include coordination of multinational
force formations, interoperability of military equipment, maintenance
of effective communications among different military forces, and
overall quality of military forces.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These challenges cannot be resolved fully in the very short term,
and there will not always be smooth interaction between current
NATO forces and those of newer members whose quality varies greatly
at this point. After all, NATO's Cold War defense structure was
developed over many years. However, such concerns can be assuaged
if NATO works with potential new members to address military requirements,
although no nation should be admitted until it satisfies specified
NATO military standards<sup>10</sup>.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A separate but related concern is that in taking on new commitments,
NATO will be overextended militarily. Again, a review of NATO's
past is helpful. For example, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff were
uncomfortable with bringing Italy into NATO because it might overextend
NATO's abilities in the Mediterranean region<sup>11</sup>.  In fact, Italy's
membership has proved to be a significant military plus for NATO.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another concern is that the presence of former or current Communists
in senior government positions in new member nations could serve
as a Trojan Horse and present security problems for NATO and its
members. Security leaks to Moscow are of particular concern. 
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Former Communists indeed are making a comeback throughout the
former Warsaw Pact nations. This is legitimate cause for worry,
although this trend may reverse itself over time. The solution
is simple: NATO should monitor this matter very carefully, and
refuse to admit a new member if there is a genuine security problem.
Of course, it also should take appropriate measures to ensure
the security of vital military information and intelligence.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Political Institutions and Practices</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some have suggested that former Warsaw Pact nations should not
be admitted to NATO because their domestic institutions are still
not fully democratic. However, in the past, NATO has not made
democracy an absolute criterion for membership. Rather, it balanced
strategic necessity with political concerns. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Portugal, Turkey, and Greece, for example, were admitted to NATO
at a time when they were not democracies. They were admitted because
of their perceived military benefit against a clear Soviet threat.
Spain, on the other hand, was not admitted for many years because
perceived military advantages were considered not sufficient to
override its non-democratic political system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are hopeful signs of political progress in many former Communist
nations, and a return of pre-1989 communism among potential Central
European applicants for NATO membership is most unlikely. Nonetheless,
the possibility of reversion to authoritarian rule cannot be ruled
out, and it is not fully clear at what point some of the nations
interested in being considered for NATO membership will consolidate
their democratic political experiments. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Further, with no immediate direct security threat to NATO, political
standards can be made a higher priority. Indeed, as a practical
matter, it would likely prove difficult to obtain endorsement
of NATO member legislatures for new members whose governments
are not clearly democratic.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, NATO will need to balance the geopolitical benefits of expansion
with respect to a specific country against any domestic political
flaws. For example, Slovakia's location separating Poland and
Hungary argues for its admission to NATO on practical military
grounds along with those other two nations. However, its domestic
practices at present clearly do not meet democratic standards.<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alliance should apply political criteria with some flexibility.
This is because the prospect of NATO membership, as well as the
fact of membership, may well have a positive impact on the domestic
politics of potential new entrants. NATO membership played a positive
role in stabilizing fragile European democracies after World War
II, and also helped Spain through a shaky transition period to
democracy. Admission of emerging democracies such as Poland and
Hungary could well have a similar impact.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, while NATO need not and should not admit new nations solely
in order to reinforce democracy, admission to the alliance nonetheless
has the potential to produce this important side benefit. <BR>
<BR>

<b>
<P>
Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's growth would likely have significant financial costs not
only for NATO itself, but also for member nations and any new
admittees. Most of these costs would be associated with enhancing
military capabilities.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At this early point, calculations of financial costs must be provisional
and depend greatly upon assumptions about such matters as the
threat perceptions, military strategy, and force structure of
potential new members and NATO itself. Nevertheless, approximate
costs, assuming differing levels of military forces, have been
estimated.<sup>13</sup>  These totals assume an implementation period of 10
to 15 years, although there will be continuing costs after this
period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A least expensive option of around $20 billion would focus on
enhancing self-defense for new members by upgrading relevant military
capabilities, combined with NATO logistics and communications
support. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second approach costing around $20 billion to $30 billion would
include a buildup by new members combined with giving NATO a meaningful
capability to project air power. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even more capable option costing around $50 billion would include
the same new member buildup, combined with in-region infrastructure
and a NATO air and ground force designed for power projection
into the region (to include a 10-ground-division, 10-air-wing
NATO regional capability); for around $35 billion, a more modest
version of this option with a less ambitious version of this military
package could be assembled.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Establishing a classic conventional military capability with NATO
air and ground forces actually deployed in the new members' region
could cost considerably more than $50 billion.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These costs are significant. Current NATO members, including the
U.S., would have to contribute equitable financial shares. But
the new members themselves would have to balance requirements
for economic development with the need for military-related expenditures,
and thus make real sacrifices during a difficult period of economic
development.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, financial requirements should be viewed in context.

Over a multi-year period, and broken into shares from NATO nations
and new members, the costs to all parties should be manageable.
A plausible estimate for a U.S. contribution would be an expenditure
of around $1 billion to $2 billion per year for 10 to 15 years.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If expansion is in America's and the West's interests, the costs
should be manageable and acceptable as a modest supplement to
what the U.S. already spends for its own security and that of
its allies.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and U.S. Interests</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A secure, stable Europe whose nation-states have free political
and economic systems is very much in America's national interest;
and bringing qualified and appropriate new members into NATO makes
this more likely.<sup>16</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. influence and leadership in Europe also can advance American
interests. Indeed, it is likely that admission of new members
would enhance U.S. influence in NATO. This is because the views
of those nations most likely to be offered membership parallel
those of the U.S. on most important security issues.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>THE PROCESS OF NATO EXPANSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if NATO expansion is a good idea in principle, there are
a number of important practical issues which will have to be addressed
and resolved for the process of expansion to succeed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Initial Invitation List</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A number of nations have indicated an interest in joining NATO.
In the short term at least, only a few will be considered seriously
for membership. These nations include the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland. Slovakia is also mentioned (these four nations together
are referred to at times as the &quot;Visegrad Group&quot;). If
Austria, Sweden or Finland &#173;&#173; all new members of the
European Union (EU) &#173;&#173; were to seek membership, they
would likely go to the top of the list.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the moment, the Czech Republic is closest to meeting likely
NATO standards for membership, while Poland and Hungary are making
progress. Slovakia is less likely to be invited at first because
of questionable domestic political practices. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Any other admissions to membership probably would be some years
away. Plausible future candidates might include Slovenia, Bulgaria,
and Romania. Baltic nations may meet eligibility criteria as well,
but concern about Russian reaction could inhibit NATO's approach.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Pace of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some who accept the principle of NATO enlargement nonetheless
would prefer a very slow pace. One rationale is that expansion
might have a negative impact on Russian policy and give anti-Western
candidates in the June 1996 Russian presidential elections a campaign
issue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, it makes no sense for Russia to be a determining factor
in the timing of NATO enlargement. Under such logic, expansion
could be delayed indefinitely because for the foreseeable future,
the possibility of a negative Russian reaction will always exist.
Indeed, it seems more likely that the longer the enlargement process
is dragged out, the more potential there is for problems with
Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. leadership is important in catalyzing NATO enlargement, and
the pace of expansion should not be constrained artificially.
In addition, NATO itself can expedite the process by, for example,
appointing an Assistant Secretary General to deal with expansion-related
issues, as well as with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council
(NACC) and Partnership for Peace (PFP).<sup>17</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Criteria for Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that, either implicitly or explicitly, NATO will
apply political and economic membership standards. Plausible domestic
political requirements for prospective members include democratic
institutions and practices; a market economy; the rule of law
along with institutional and legal protection for minority rights;
and civilian democratic control of the military, intelligence
agencies, police, and internal security forces. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Legitimate concern exists that NATO might lose its leverage for
domestic reform once a nation is admitted to membership. Thus,
pressure for continued reform must be maintained after the admission
of new members. Indeed, entry into NATO (along with pressure from
the European Union) can be a positive force for political change.
Spain's admission to NATO in 1982 very likely helped reinforce
and consolidate its nascent democratic institutions; and NATO
membership undoubtedly was a factor in the consolidation of democracy
in Portugal, Greece, and Turkey.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO in any event has the option of developing procedures for
the suspension or even expulsion of a member whose domestic or
international policies fall fundamentally short of NATO expectations.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>International Aspects of Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can ask new members to meet certain foreign policy standards.
For example, new members could be required to renounce all territorial
claims on other nations. NATO could also insist that new invitees
(for example, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary) implement
trans-regional cooperative endeavors, such as common security
planning at a sub-regional level.<sup>18</sup>  For its own part, NATO could
formalize its already implicit policy of not becoming involved
militarily in a dispute among NATO member nations. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO also might require agreement from new members to submit any
disputes with other NATO nations to international arbitration,
and new entrants could be asked to shape their militaries for
defensive missions only.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO certainly should expect commitments from prospective members
to assist anti-terrorism efforts, to participate in countering
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their delivery
systems, and to prohibit the export of arms or militarily applicable
technology to rogue nations.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Military Criteria for New Members</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should expect that new members will contribute to its overall
military capabilities and, conversely, will not undermine its
military effectiveness. How each new member should comply with
these standards remains to be decided. NATO could require, for
example, that new members agree to join its integrated military
structure (this is important because this structure fosters smoother
and more efficient military operations). New members also could
be required to strengthen very quickly &#173;&#173; in line with
NATO standards &#173;&#173; the military capabilities of selected
military units, and to work for operational military compatibility
with NATO forces over the longer term.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New members could be required to make their territory and military
facilities available for NATO use, and otherwise support NATO
military requirements, without any unilateral constraints on NATO
activities. Moreover, new members could be required to keep their
military forces and planning open to view by NATO allies, and
to assure the protection of intelligence information.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The structure of the military forces of new members will be a
crucial factor in determining the effectiveness and costs of military
cooperation between new members and NATO. Also important will
be the need to determine exactly how NATO's forces would be structured
and deployed in peacetime, as well as at a time of crisis or conflict,
to fulfill NATO security commitments to new members.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Military force structure options for new members range from Swiss-type
civilian-based forces to a large standing army. Possibilities
must be weighed in the context of such factors as perceived national
interests and potential military threats, the relationship of
national armed forces to NATO's military structure, costs, and
other factors. It also would be advantageous for NATO if new members'
forces can contribute in a militarily significant way to any future
Persian Gulf-type conflicts.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At a minimum, force structure decisions by prospective members
should be taken within the context of maximizing regional (Central
or Eastern European) military cooperation and strengths, and also
within the context of extensive consultations with NATO. For example,
shared arms production and military purchases and assistance should
be pursued in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of military
capabilities and achieve military economies of scale. Defense
cooperation and co-production arrangements (arrangements by two
or more nations to join in researching, developing, or producing
a technology, system, or weapon), either among prospective new
members themselves or with other NATO members (including the U.S.),
can reinforce this approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, the military forces of likely new members will not
come close to meeting NATO's standards and requirements for many
years. Since full operational integration will not be feasible,
a realistic shorter-term objective would be to assure that the
troops of the old and new members work together as smoothly as
possible. Ways in which this might be accomplished include developing
an integrated air defense network, conducting NATO military exercises
on new members' territory, prepositioning military supplies; and
deploying aircraft to bases on new members' territory at regular
intervals (called &quot;dual basing&quot;).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, NATO's own evolving strategies and military
capabilities need to undergo further changes in order to accommodate
a larger NATO. These changes include: <BR>

<P><ul>
<li>Continuing revisions in NATO's forces and command structures and
planning processes, both to streamline NATO's military structure
and to establish command units specifically responsible for the
territory of new members; <BR>

<P>
<li>Adapting NATO's forces so that sub-groups of NATO nations, such
as the Western European Union (WEU) or ad hoc coalitions, can
utilize NATO's military resources when appropriate;<sup>19</sup> <BR>

<P>
<li>Further developing multinational formations (military units composed
of personnel from more than one nation), which will be even more
challenging when new members are involved; <BR>

<P>
<li>Reviewing the role of nuclear deterrence in post-Cold War Europe,
a continuing requirement even with NATO's current membership,
because nuclear strategy inevitably will be affected by the addition
of new members; and<BR>

<P>
<li>Assessing and implementing air and theater missile defenses which
take new members into account.<BR>
<BR>
</ul>

<P>
<b>Reassuring Uninvited Nations</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion may cause at least some short-term sense of exclusion
or resentment among those not invited in the first round of admissions.
The reaction of uninvited nations could range from bruised feelings
to an interest in making alternative security arrangements, and
momentum for internal reform in such nations could be slowed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should seek to defuse such possibilities. For example, it
can make clear that expansion is a process and that NATO remains
open to new members even after the first new admissions. The alliance
also should increase the involvement of such nations in enhanced
Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council political
programs and meetings while encouraging their interaction with
other European organizations, such as the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU),
as well as bilateral programs.<sup>20</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can point out that the PFP framework already provides a <I>de
facto</I> equivalent of NATO's Article Four security relationship
to PFP participants. While Article Five addresses the defense
of members' territory against armed attack, Article Four calls
for consultations against more general security threats against
a member.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the alliance can also reinforce efforts to link relevant
NATO members more closely with nations that are not invited to
join initially. For example, Scandinavian members can work more
closely with Baltic nations, and southern region members can develop
closer links with Balkan and Mediterranean countries. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Sequence of Admission</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sequencing of new admissions could have an impact on the reactions
of those nations not invited to join. NATO will still have to
decide, for example, how eligible nations should be admitted &#173;&#173;
whether individually or in groups &#173;&#173; and in what order.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inviting nations in groups rather than individually could avoid
the tensions caused by admitting some nations before others which
also are eligible. At the same time, some suggest it would be
best not to invite all eligible members at the same time in order
to establish that admitting new members is a process rather than
a one-time event.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is too early in the expansion process to suggest which approach
is most appropriate. All that can be said at this time is that
if NATO chooses not to invite all eligible nations together, it
will need to explain clearly its rationale for implementing the
first wave of admissions in phases. NATO also needs to provide
a realistic assessment to those nations whose prospects for entry
are minimal or nil.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and Non-NATO Institutions</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The growth of NATO will occur within a context of multiple European
institutions. Most important is the Western European Union, which
is linked to the European Union. All WEU members also participate
in NATO, while the EU has several members who are not NATO members.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The WEU has defense obligations to its members and is considering
admitting new members. Further, the WEU might assume defense obligations
for all EU members. If the WEU admits new members before NATO
does, or if it assumes an obligation to defend all EU members,
then current WEU (and NATO) members will be taking on new defense
obligations to nations which are not NATO members. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has important implications for NATO. WEU nations could become
embroiled in a conflict in order to defend a non-NATO member of
the WEU &#173;&#173; Austria, Sweden, and Finland recently have
been admitted, and other nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic,
and Hungary have applied for membership &#173;&#173; or a non-NATO
member of the EU. These WEU nations, if counterattacked, might
then seek to invoke NATO commitments for their own defense. This
would mean, in particular, that the U.S. could be called upon
to help defend NATO members in a conflict originally involving
an attack on a non-NATO WEU member even though NATO had no obligation
to defend the WEU or EU nations which were attacked. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid such situations, NATO would have to coordinate
its expansion process with that of the WEU and the EU. Ideally,
nations should become members of both groups at around the same
time.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion should proceed on its own merits and terms. However,
as part of the enlargement process, NATO should hold out to Moscow
the possibility of a positive or even formal relationship if Russia
pursues responsible policies. For example, the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council, whose members include all NATO nations and
all former Warsaw Pact nations and ex-Soviet republics, could
be given an enhanced role and responsibility for considering European
political and security issues (including Russian involvement in
neighboring nations) and developing responses to security problems.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the short term, NATO should pursue a dual approach. Russian
participation in the PFP should be developed through such means
as security consultations and humanitarian relief training exercises
in order to demonstrate the positive aspects of a new relationship
with the West. At the same time, NATO should advise Moscow that
any renewed expansionism will end such activities and result in
contingency planning against such a Russian approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO remains, as always, a defensive and transparent alliance.
Any reasonable Russian concerns can be addressed; and a NATO-Russia
relationship can be institutionalized, up to and including a NATO-Russia
agreement defining the terms of the relationship, if Moscow accepts
the reality that NATO can expand. Of course, should Russia come
under the control of extreme nationalist and expansionist forces,
NATO will need to adopt appropriate measures in response.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Ukraine and NATO Enlargement</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ukraine is an especially important part of the European geopolitical
equation. Without control of Ukraine, it would be much more difficult
for an expansionist Russia to threaten the West directly. Although
independent, Kiev still remains sensitive to Russian concerns
and thus far has been ambivalent about NATO membership.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A fundamental Western objective should be to assure that Ukraine
is not reincorporated into a revived Russian empire. NATO, as
well as NATO nations acting bilaterally, will need to make Ukraine
a top priority for economic assistance, strengthened political
relationships, and security assistance. All this should be implemented
with a sensitivity to the challenges posed by Ukraine's balancing
act between the West and Moscow. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Financial Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most costs incurred by NATO expansion will be to meet military
requirements. Current NATO members will have to contribute to
the costs of expansion, with the U.S. providing a reasonable financial
share. In addition, there should be significant economic assistance
from the European Union for economic development so that new members
can allocate sufficient resources to improving military capabilities.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, new members will have to demonstrate a significant
financial commitment, which will be a challenge in view of their
still early stages of economic development. Creative arrangements,
including loans, grants, and even barter arrangements, need to
be explored. NATO nations also should consider the sale or lease
of excess military items to new members.<sup>21</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, NATO funding for common infrastructure facilities,
such as military bases and storage facilities, can be allocated
to new members. Costs for military items may be lowered by developing
co-production arrangements and taking advantage of economies of
scale.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The American debate over NATO enlargement, in a fundamental sense,
will be over the proper U.S. international role in the post-Cold
War world and the continuing relevance of NATO to U.S. interests.
If America wishes to protect its security interests beyond the
Western Hemisphere and help shape the international environment,
and if it is to continue as an international leader, NATO enlargement
will further those objectives. The enlargement of NATO also will
advance the consolidation of peace and freedom throughout Europe,
the expansion of NATO's common democratic security culture, and
the protection of U.S. interests in that region and elsewhere.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many of the arguments raised against NATO expansion are specious
or based on inaccurate or exaggerated concerns. At the same time,
there are reasonable questions and concerns about how NATO expansion
would work. These concerns must be addressed satisfactorily by
NATO and by candidates for membership. In particular, prospective
members, as well as NATO member nations, will have to contribute
their fair share, financially and otherwise.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The continuing importance of NATO is clear. Not only are nations
clamoring for admission, but long-standing member France has decided
to reinvigorate its participation in the alliance.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has brought in several new members since its inception.<sup>22</sup> Admission of new members at this point would not be a radical
change, but rather a natural progression in NATO's steady growth
over the years. Opening the alliance to new members would ratify
the expansion of freedom's borders and the reality that new entrants
already are a part of the West.<BR>

<li>There is nothing that would prohibit NATO

<li>The OSCE (formerly knows as the CSCE)
is composed of 53 nations and addresses a variety of areas, including
the development of international norms of behavior, institutional
support for democracy and human rights, and efforts at confidence&#173;building
and conflict resolution. The EU is composed of 15 European nations
and is the instrument for efforts to integrate Europe politically

members could use around $1 billion to $2 billion annually in
Western defense&#173;related loans and grants; <I>op. cit.</I>,

for example, is considering the leasing of F&#173;16s to Poland.

<p><blockquote>
"We must, however, continue to express our concerns about mandated 
Medicaid expansions. States do not have the luxury of operating a budget 
deficit. Every mandated dollar that we spend is a real dollar that has to be 
taken from another program."
</blockquote><p>
--Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, June 7, 1990

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much of the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid, the health care program 
serving the nation's poor, has transpired without adequate attention paid to the 
effect of the program on state finances. If significant reforms in Medicaid are 
not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the 
proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to the program. 
And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the 
rate for total state spending, the states will be forced either to increase taxes or 
to divert money from other programs, such as education and crime control.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medicaid is a state-administered 
program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments 
jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a 
statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower 
per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 
83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The cost of Medicaid to the federal 
government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid 
costs will almost double by 2002.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the financial impact on the 
federal government of generally unrestrained Medicaid growth is alarming 
enough, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless 
growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid that 
forces them either to raise taxes in order to maintain spending for other 
programs or to reduce state expenditures for non-Medicaid programs. States 
can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal 
rules requiring that certain levels of coverage (entitlements) be provided to 
certain populations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To examine the probable future 
budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend of 
total Medicaid spending using certain assumptions to forecast the state share 
of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002.<sup> 2</sup>  This 
analysis resulted in two sets of findings:  first, the additional costs to the states 
if no changes are made in the Medicaid program and, second, the additional 
costs stemming from President Clinton's proposed "per capita cap" reforms in 
Medicaid. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level 
Medicaid burden if Congress either does nothing or adopts the President's 
proposal. These projections of state spending incorporate expected changes in 
state economic activity, in the size of the eligible population, and in the trend 
of federal Medicaid transfers to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These forecasts of future state 
Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton 
Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally recognized 
economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 
47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between changes in 
historical Medicaid spending and fluctuations in the states' economic activity 
and Medicaid-eligible populations. In four cases, however, the relationship 
was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in 
spending; these states are North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming. 
<a href="cb22t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the 
states are to meet their projected Medicaid expenditures.
<p>
<b>Estimated Additional Costs Without Reform</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Between 1995 and 2002, if no 
reforms are enacted that address the costs of entitlements and the composition 
of covered groups, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money 
on Medicaid. Total state spending over this period is projected to be $1,700 
billion, of which $1,011 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if 
CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between 
federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote 
an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among 
the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 17 percent of its 
revenues to the health care program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="cb22c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of 
state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 
1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. 
These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion 
by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid 
by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the 12-year period 
between 1990 and 2002. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some individual states will be 
particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $18 billion in 
new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 
1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $17.3 billion; Florida, 
$12.9 billion; Pennsylvania, $11.6 billion; and Texas, $7.2 billion. If these 
states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California 
will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $246 per year; New York, 
by $370; Florida, by $374; Pennsylvania, by $362; and Texas, by $177.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This rapid growth in the states' 
Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level 
Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes 
support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation 
infrastructure (see <a href="cb22c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state 
Medicaid spending to grow at a rate of 7.5 percent, while total state spending 
should grow at a 6.4 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid 
means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other 
state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will 
continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-
2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8.4 percent rate, while 
total state expenditures are expected to grow by an average of 5.8 percent.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Effects of the "Blue Dog" Democrat Plan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Democratic "Blue Dog" plan to 
reform the federal Medicaid program, the principal elements of which have 
been advanced by the Clinton Administration in its seven-year budget 
proposal, would increase the federal fiscal burden on the states by an 
estimated $47.4 billion over the next seven years. This new fiscal burden has 
been described as "one of the biggest and most expensive unfunded [federal] 
mandates ever"<sup> 3</sup> and, over the seven-year period 1996-2002, 
would amount to $4.4 billion in California, $3.7 billion in Florida, $3.4 billion 
in New York, $3.2 billion in Pennsylvania, and over $2.9 billion in Texas. 
Overall, this unfunded federal mandate would exceed $1 billion in 16 states. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First proposed by a group of 
Democratic House members earlier this year,<sup>4 </sup> this plan would 
further challenge the fiscal resources of the states by maintaining all the 
existing program mandates which the federal government imposes on the 
states<sup> 5</sup> while simultaneously reducing the federal government's 
contribution through the mechanism of a "per capita cap" on the federal share 
of the program. Under the "Blue Dog" plan, the per capita cap limits the 
amount of federal medical assistance that states would receive for each 
Medicaid recipient. Any expenses that exceed this limit would be the sole 
responsibility of state and local taxpayers. Because the full array of federal 
Medicaid mandates would remain in effect, states would not be able to offer 
innovative, and less expensive, health care options to Medicaid recipients. 
Overall, the per capita cap would shift an estimated $47.4 billion of mandated 
Medicaid spending from the federal to state governments over the next seven 
years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would probably respond to 
this shift in one of three ways:  1) enact dramatic tax increases; 2) reduce state 
spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement, and other important 
state functions; or 3) some combination of the above. Indeed, the proliferation 
of Medicaid mandates during the late 1980s and early 1990s has already 
forced the states to reallocate their resources to Medicaid. According to the 
National Association of State Budget Officers, Medicaid spending has 
doubled from approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall 
state spending since 1987.<sup> 6</sup>
<p>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Heritage Foundation and 
Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic 
activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the 
additional funds states would need to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our baseline estimates assume no 
change in current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid 
transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this 
program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of the 
state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and 
economic change. We used this as the basic structure for future Medicaid 
spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These baseline forecasts of state 
Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher 
federal expenditures on Medicaid projected by the Congressional Budget 
Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) 
spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $58 billion over the period 1996 
to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each 
state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the 
seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would 
be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated 
by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of 
taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the principal goals of government regulation is to protect the public and save lives. But how efficiently does today's system of regulation achieve that goal?  Federal agencies are criticized increasingly for imposing ineffective, costly regulations on individuals and businesses that do little to improve public health and safety. The criticism ranges from accusations of poor-quality science being used to estimate the magnitude of health risks, to the growing trend of agencies to regulate purely hypothetical health risks that likely pose no danger whatsoever. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year due to the current command-and-control system, chiefly by squandering billions of dollars on eliminating risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The traditional rhetoric of those who support the current regulatory system -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is simply wrong. Well-intentioned regulations can kill. Alarmists have succeeded in convincing the public that a reformed regulatory system would "roll back protection" -- for example, that women would be denied life-saving mammograms and our food supply would not be safe from deadly <I>e.coli</I> bacteria. This is untrue. A reformed system would allow us to devote more resources, not less, to the types of activities which we know save lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress has been unsuccessful in its efforts to frame the issues clearly for Americans. But, rather than passively allow the assertions of alarmists and regulatory extremists to go unanswered, reformers can and should seize the moral high ground in the debate over risk regulation. They should point out that their reforms and solutions actually will save more lives. In effect, they can help Americans get "more bang for the regulatory buck."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Reformers must understand and effectively communicate five simple truths about risk regulation to convince the public that regulatory reform will result in more protection, not less:
<P><ol>
<b><li>Not every risk is avoidable.</b> While eliminating every risk from life is desirable, it also is impossible. People make decisions every day regarding the types of risk they choose to face, and accidents do happen. A 100 percent risk-free, accident-free society is an impossible goal, and it is unwise for regulators to act as if it were achievable.<p>

<b><li>All risks are relative.</b> Almost everything we do every day carries some degree of risk. But some risks obviously are greater than others. Some risks may sound catastrophic while actually being relatively trivial because the likelihood of harm is so low. For example, many Americans still fear airplane flight despite clear evidence it is one of the safest modes of transportation available. By contrast, commonplace everyday risks such as driving to work pose a greater health hazard because they occur more frequently and the chance of accidents is greater.
<p>
<b><li>Wealthier is healthier.</b> Higher incomes increase living standards which, in turn, improve health and increase life expectancy. As the standard of living improves, overall public health and safety improves. Conversely, actions which lower living standards typically increase risk and shorten life expectancy. Thus, the more burdensome the regulations, the greater the drain on the economy and on the prosperity and health of Americans. This cost must be balanced against any benefit from a regulation.<p>

<b><li>Regulations can have adverse side effects, thus creating more risk and less protection.</b> While some regulation saves lives, some federal regulations actually cost more lives than they save by discouraging innovation, decreasing incomes, destroying economic output and job opportunities, and creating other new risks in pursuit of policy objectives. For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations meant to guarantee the safety of drugs or medical devices often delay the release of these products, placing millions more lives at risk.
<p>
<b><li>More lives would be saved if risks were prioritized.</b> If federal regulators identified and prioritized risks more effectively, as many as 60,000 additional lives could be saved each year.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These truths constitute the foundation of how to talk about risk regulation. This study is intended to help policymakers communicate in clearer terms the problems underlying today's system of risk regulation and describe a framework for reform.
<p>
<b>LIFE AND RISK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

We face risks every day of our lives. It is risky to eat, breathe, and walk down the street. Tragedy can strike from unknown and improbable sources. The world is full of risk, and no one is free from its dangers. But we also put ordinary risks in perspective. Even though people are constantly exposed to potentially dangerous circumstances, few decide to live in seclusion merely to avoid a slight chance of harm. While people wisely avoid unacceptable risks, they also wisely ignore or take only minor precautions against the vast majority of potential dangers facing them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Common sense tells us that risk is a relative matter. All other things being equal, less risk is better. But not all other things <I>are</I> equal -- sometimes it is better to accept small amounts of risk because the rewards are so great. In fact, humans do this every day when they risk poisoning by eating food or taking medicine or when they drive to work. The reason: Even with reasonable government protections and private precautions, there is a risk. But while the possibility of, say, food poisoning, remains real, usually it is very small and the alternative is unacceptable to most people. People calmly accept commonplace risks everyday. Life is a series of prudent trade-offs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, this is not understood by government bureaucrats who continue to craft regulations with the goal of eliminating all risk from society. These regulators, in an effort to be cautious and "safe," often impose great economic burdens on those they regulate to eliminate the slightest risk of death or injury. Even the smallest element of risk in society typically is deemed intolerable and unacceptable. The enormity of the cost often is irrelevant to regulators as they pursue a "zero-risk" or "no-risk" society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk trade-offs and opportunity costs.</b> While these policymakers are well-intentioned, they ignore the important point that risk is neither created nor eliminated in a vacuum. Every action has consequences. Any attempt to decrease or eliminate risk will entail a corresponding trade-off. Every action taken by an individual or organization means that other opportunities are closed off. Economists refer to these lost opportunities as opportunity costs. More specifically, the opportunity cost of a given action refers to the forgone benefits that could have been obtained by employing resources in an alternative way.<sup>1</sup>  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>On an elementary level, most people enjoy watching television as well as reading books or magazines, but understand there is a trade-off between the two at any given time. The opportunity cost of watching television is the lost chance to read.
<p>
<li>On a more complex level, the opportunity cost of prohibiting a business from hiring and paying workers at whatever wage they can afford may be an overall loss in employment and income for the economy.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<li>Likewise, federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which require increased fuel economy in American automobiles, undoubtedly have saved fuel. But this has come at the expense of many thousands of lives lost, because auto companies were effectively forced to manufacture much lighter-weight cars to meet the fuel economy standards, and these cars were not heavy enough to protect drivers and passengers as well in accidents.<sup>3</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In each case, a trade-off is made, although the trade-off may not be consciously understood. Consequently, opportunity costs are incurred. Such costs can range from very expensive to fairly trivial; hidden to visible; extremely complex to easily understood. Whatever their magnitude, there are real costs and trade-offs associated with every regulatory decision.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In an important new book, <I>Risk vs. Risk</I>,<sup>4</sup> John Graham, Director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis and President-elect of the Society for Risk Analysis, and Jonathan Baert Weiner, Associate Professor in the School of Law and the School of Environment at Duke University, develop a conceptual framework (referred to as "Risk Trade-off Analysis" or "RTA") to help policymakers and the public better understand the nature of risk trade-offs. Graham and Weiner argue that the best way to understand the dangers inherent in the risk assessment process is to plot on a chart the relationship between "target risks" and "countervailing risks."  Target risks are those risks that regulations are designed to reduce. A countervailing risk is the unintended and undesirable consequence that results from attempts to reduce the target risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, consider Graham's and Weiner's hypothetical example of how someone might go about reducing the risk of a headache. To alleviate the target risk, the headache, the sufferer could take several aspirin. While taking several aspirin usually will lessen the headache, it often comes at the cost of a countervailing risk -- a severely upset stomach. As the chart below reveals, if the recommended remedy for the target risk is merely to take several aspirin while ignoring any side effects, improvements can be made along the target risk axis. Yet alleviating the target risk may increase the risk of severe stomach problems, moving us backwards on the countervailing risk axis. Thus, both types of risks must be acknowledged so that the proper balance can be struck or alternative treatments found to remedy the target risk without creating heightened countervailing risks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Risk Trade-off Analysis, as developed by Graham and Weiner, simply draws attention to the inevitable trade-offs policymakers face when attempting to eliminate target risks. Actions taken to alleviate target risks may come at the expense of heightened countervailing risks. When legislators and regulators ignore the opportunity costs of such trade-offs, the results can be unfortunate and even deadly. A clear case of this is the CAFE standard mentioned earlier. Increased fuel economy in cars (the target risk) was achieved, but at the expense of increased highway fatalities (the countervailing risk).
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Graham and Weiner provide many other examples of how RTA can be used to examine inefficient risk analysis:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Regulations aimed at decreasing solid waste in landfills from disposable diapers can decrease this target risk by encouraging increased use of washable cloth diapers.</b> Yet this produces a countervailing risk: more air pollution created by increased energy-intensive washing and household pickup services by high-polluting trucks.
<p>
<li><b>Banning the pesticide EDB may have eliminated the very slight cancer risk it posed, but only at the expense of a more dangerous cancer-causing fungus left on the food</b> that used to be treated with the pesticide.
<p>
<li><b>In 1991, Peru suffered a massive outbreak of cholera, which killed 7,000 people and afflicted over 800,000 others. This was caused by Peru's decision to ban the chlorination of drinking water, based on American risk studies</b> that had shown there might be a slight chance of developing cancer due to chlorine. But the chances of cancer death from chlorinated water turned out to be far less than the risk of death due to a contaminated drinking supply.
<p>
<li><b>Asbestos abatement efforts actually pose a greater risk to human health than non-action, since the substance has been shown to be virtually harmless if left alone.</b> Thus, regulations requiring asbestos removal not only have wasted scarce public health dollars, but also have placed workers removing it and others at greater risk from dust stirred up once it was agitated.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clearly, as shown by these examples, if Congress ever hopes to fix the grave problems of the current risk assessment and management systems, it must be aware of the opportunity costs that are inextricably entwined with all risk regulation trade-offs. While the benefits of some regulations may outweigh the cost, more often they do not. And that means lives are lost unnecessarily. Why is this the case?
<p>
<b>How Well-Intentioned Regulations Can Cost Lives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Attempting to save lives by trying to eliminate every risk from life actually can increase the overall death toll for many reasons. The primary reason: Avoiding one risk necessarily implies accepting others. Even in the United States, with a gross national product of $7 trillion, there are limited resources that can be devoted to reducing risk. At the very least, policymakers should acknowledge that saving lives by taking one action precludes using those same resources to save other -- and perhaps more -- lives. In many cases, if the private resources used in complying with federal mandates were left to the individuals affected, or used in other ways in the economy, Americans would benefit more. The country cannot afford to eliminate all risk, since trying to do so can reduce safety.

As Supreme Court Justice Stephan Breyer noted in his 1993 study of risk regulation, <I>Breaking the Vicious Circle</I>, while it would be wonderful to eradicate every last bit of risk from life, trying to "go that last mile" can be pursued "to the point where it brings about more harm than good."<sup>5</sup>  Few additional gains are made in terms of public health and safety when such a strategy is followed, Breyer argues, since "[r]emoving that last little bit can involve limited technological choice, high cost, devotion of considerable agency resources, large legal fees, and endless argument."<sup>6</sup>  To better understand Justice Breyer's point, critics of the onerous current system must learn to speak in terms of "wealthier is healthier."

<b>Assuming the moral high ground: Why a higher standard of living keeps people safer.</b> Increasingly, academics, expert analysts, and even government officials argue that large increases in regulatory spending can result in more lives lost than saved. But while true, this is counter-intuitive for most people. After all, regulation ostensibly is designed to protect people, and this usually would be true if the benefits of regulation existed in a vacuum with no costs, including opportunity costs. Regulation neither exists in a vacuum nor necessarily corresponds with more protection; yet it always entails costs. When the cost of well-intentioned risk regulations is a corresponding decrease in the overall economic welfare of average citizens, the net result can be lost lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is an old saying that health is wealth. The converse is also true: Wealth is health. As <a href="tp13c2.gif">Chart 2</a> and <a href="tp13a1.gif">Appendix 1</a> suggest, comparing average national income levels to life expectancy and infant mortality in 132 surveyed countries reveals a strong correlation. More children survive and adults live longer in countries with higher incomes. Why does this occur?  There are many reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One reason is that increases in economic production make possible innovations such as medical technology, antibiotics, weather-resistant shelter, and safer modes of transportation. These factors in turn increase life expectancy. Another is that wealthy, robust economies encourage job creation, which also lowers deaths by reducing the ranks of unemployed workers, who suffer from higher mortality rates. Moreover, increased wealth extends life expectancy for those already fully employed by giving them opportunities to buy better food and shelter, purchase more health insurance, drive safer cars, and otherwise live a less stressful life. Furthermore, a healthier population produces even more wealth, so the wealth-health cycle becomes self-perpetuating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These advances have done more to reduce the very real everyday risks Americans face than the great majority of risk regulations currently on the books. Despite "Chicken Little" claims by some alarmists, life is getting less risky all the time. The easiest way to see this is to compare turn-of-the-century life expectancy figures with today's. Total life expectancy in the year 1900 was just 48 years; today, it is 76 years. This remarkable 60 percent jump is due primarily to the ever-increasing standard of living enjoyed by Americans over the span of this century. Steadily rising incomes have allowed individuals and families to make ongoing investments in risk-alleviating measures that increase their health and that of their families. In fact, two scientists in the early 1980s estimated that for every 1 percent change in income, mortality is reduced by approximately 0.05 percent.<sup>7</sup>  Again, wealthier is not only healthier, but highly risk-reducing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is also worth noting that these large gains in human health and longevity occurred just as rapidly before the onset of most federal regulatory programs in the early 1970s as they have since. In fact, from 1900 to 1969, life expectancy at birth rose by an average of 0.8 percent per year (see <a href="tp13c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). By way of comparison, from 1970 to 1990, life expectancy grew by only 0.3 percent per year. Policymakers need to ask themselves how these amazing gains were made prior to 1970 without federal health and safety rules. The answer, of course, lies in the wealth-health phenomenon.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Regulation: The other side of the story.</b> Regulations, including those that ostensibly are supposed to reduce risk, can cause fatalities whenever they destroy wealth, confiscate property, or discourage employment and product innovation. This should be taken into account whenever a regulation is proposed. Jobs are lost and wealth is destroyed when output is restricted, resources are used inefficiently, or entrepreneurialism in general is discouraged. Product innovation likewise is suppressed whenever government too strictly regulates the development, distribution, and use of products with life-saving potential.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Several recent regulatory and judicial decisions support this concept. For instance, the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has noted that for each additional $7.5 million increase in the regulatory burden imposed on Americans, one human life is lost.9  According to OIRA, the reduction in economic activity due to the burden of regulation itself actually increases risk because living standards are reduced, and this causes mortality rates to rise. This increased mortality, however, reflects only the heightened risk caused by the economic effects of regulations and is separate from reduced risks that could be achieved by devoting expenditures to other uses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using this estimate:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $119 billion</b> to avert just one death under an OSHA-based formaldehyde occupational exposure limit, 331 new drugs could be developed and brought to market.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $168 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based benzene regulation, 3,064 police officers could be placed on the street.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $653 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based dichloropropane water standard, 4,353 new fire trucks could be purchased -- equivalent to 10 per congressional district.<sup>12</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The late risk expert Aaron Wildavsky made clear exactly why regulation can have such counter-productive effects. He explained that the quest for a no-risk society through overzealous regulation "is the highest risk of all"<sup>13</sup> because it prohibits or interferes with the enormously beneficial trial-and-error process that weeds out unsafe products or processes and replaces them with superior alternatives. As Wildavsky noted in his influential work <I>Searching for Safety</I>, proponents of a no-risk society demand "trial <I>without</I> error," which in reality is more deadly, since "[i]f you can do nothing without knowing first how it will turn out, you cannot do anything at all.... [I]f trying new things is made more costly, there will be fewer departures from past practice; this very lack of change may itself be dangerous in forgoing chances to reduce existing hazards.... [E]xisting hazards will continue to cause harm if we fail to reduce them by taking advantage of the opportunity to benefit from repeated trials."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Those who support the current regulatory system apparently want policymakers and the public to believe that thousands of pages of new rules and hundreds of additional bureaucrats would do more to improve human health and safety than more police on the beat, more fire trucks in local communities, or more pharmaceutical drugs on the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In summary, because regulatory policy often requires that private resources be employed in sub-optimal ways, enormous costs are imposed on businesses and individual Americans alike.<sup>15</sup>  Unfortunately, as critics of the current system can now argue, these costs may often include the loss of human life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>A real world example: CLIA.</b> Take the case of CLIA, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. Despite little evidence that any serious problems existed with current laboratory testing methods, Congress became fixated on a few highly unusual cases in which laboratory testing error contributed to the death of a patient. Congress felt that even a single fatality caused by testing error was one death too many. With truly noble intentions, legislators set out to insure lab tests would be perfectly safe from that point forward -- again, the creation of a "no-risk" society was the theme. Yet, despite these good intentions, the results have been less than encouraging and have placed the lives of average Americans at even greater risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The eight-page law led to 1,600 pages of regulations as well as thousands of pages of additional guidelines. Faced with enormous paperwork costs and threatened with fines for non-compliance with this needless paperwork, tens of thousands of small private medical practices have been forced to stop administering basic patient tests or have shut down their operations altogether.<sup>16</sup>  As a result, the cost of routine laboratory tests for things such as strep infection, cholesterol levels, pregnancy, and Pap Smears has risen dramatically. With fewer patients (especially those who are poor) therefore able to obtain basic clinical tests, the overall quality of care has been reduced, and more lives are now at risk than before CLIA was passed. Good intentions have led to disastrous results. Thus, like many other regulations whose stated purpose is to reduce risk to society, CLIA is likely costing more lives than it is saving.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This real-world example provides several important lessons that apply to all risk regulation:
<P><ul>
<li><b>First, it illustrates that every regulation involves trade-offs and corresponding opportunity costs, including the cost of human life.</b> In the case of CLIA, trying to make labs completely safe is placing individuals at even greater risk.
<p>
<li><b>Second, it shows that "two wrongs don't make a right."</b>  A few chance accidents do not justify overzealous regulatory initiatives that actually create more problems than they solve. Again, it is not possible to avoid every single risk in life, and attempting to do so can lead to more harm than good.<p>

<li><b>Third, and most important, as economists Richard J. Zeckhauser and W. Kip Viscusi note, "When thinking about these tradeoffs, one should remember that improvements in mortality and morbidity have come primarily from technological progress and a higher standard of living, not from government regulation or private forbearance."</b><sup>17</sup>  Innovation, trial and error, acquired knowledge, and the corresponding benefits of progress and wealth expansion are the true keys to a safer, healthier society -- not a more onerous regulatory regime.
<p>
<li><B>Finally, where command-and-control tactics are used, whether by the FDA, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the EPA, or other regulatory agencies, fewer lives are being saved than many policymakers and average Americans have been led to believe.</b> In many cases, as with CLIA, lives may be lost because countervailing risks are being ignored.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When federal policymakers accept the validity of regulations such as CLIA without carefully considering the costs they impose, they fail to understand that resources are being used inefficiently and people often are dying as a consequence. Tammy O. Tengs of Duke University summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost."<sup>18</sup>  With federal regulatory spending growing without restraint,19 the conclusion is clear: The pursuit of a "no-risk" society through expensive and inefficient federal regulatory activity is killing Americans.
<p>
<b>How to Manage Resources Better to Reduce Risk</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The central question facing policymakers and regulators is how to obtain "more bang for the buck" when trying to reduce risk. Since economic resources in society are scarce, it is essential that policymakers examine the cost-effectiveness of measures designed to reduce risk. This requires a common reference point to measure benefits. In the scholarly literature on risk analysis, this is often done in terms of how many "life-years" are saved by a particular measure. Assuming an average woman's life span of 80 years of age, a measure that prevented her premature death at age 50 would save 30 "life-years."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In examining the cost-effectiveness of various kinds of risk-alleviating measures, recent studies using life-year analysis generally have grouped the measures into three categories: 1) medicine and medical treatments, 2) fatal injury reduction efforts, and 3) toxin control. Although rules and methods can be found in each category that save lives very efficiently, medical treatments typically generate the greatest life-year benefits for the least cost while toxin control measures produce few benefits at the highest   cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What generally saves the most lives?</b>  The most cost-effective way to save lives generally is to increase medical treatment and, to a somewhat lesser degree, to curb fatal injuries. Trying to save lives by regulating pesticides or other toxins, on the other hand, generally uses up far more resources and saves fewer lives -- meaning that shifting resources from toxin regulation to medical testing on balance typically would save lives. While it is true that some toxin regulations do save lives (for example, restrictions on the release of nuclear wastes), most do not fit into this category. A seminal study that recently surveyed 587 risk-reducing methods, programs, and rules reveals that the median cost per life-year saved -- or extending a single life by one year -- for toxin control measures is $2,800,000. In contrast, the median cost per life-year saved is $19,000 for medical treatments and $48,000 for fatal injury reductions.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just how cost-<I>ineffective</I> are the great majority of these toxin control measures?  To put the numbers in perspective, Graham notes, "the median toxin control program costs 58 times more per year of life saved than the median injury prevention program and 146 times more than the median medical program (see <a href="tp13c4.gif">Chart 4</a>)."<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is ironic since, intuitively, most policymakers and ordinary Americans assume that toxin control is perhaps the most cost-effective method of reducing risk. Many Americans generally have come to believe that federal regulations banning or severely curtailing the use of products that sound very dangerous are extremely cost-effective and represent wise public policy. It turns out that nothing could be further from the truth. For example, the following list of five federal toxin control regulations reveals the enormous costs that would have to be incurred by society in trying to save just one life-year for each of these regulations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If citizens were forced to incur these expenses to save one life-year per regulation, and if the regulatory costs for these five regulations were totaled, it would cost society roughly $189 billion for just five life-years saved. By way of comparison, spending $189 billion on developing new life-saving drugs typically would allow an additional 526 new drugs to be developed and brought to market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It should be noted that this does not mean the nation is now actually spending $189 billion to alleviate the risk posed by these five toxins. Rather, this is how much would have to be spent to save just five life-years. The numbers are extraordinarily large precisely because the risks being regulated are so small, perhaps even illusory. In reality, the nation now spends much less on implementing these five rules but does not buy five years of life for that amount.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Current policies = 60,000 extra deaths per year.</b> As noted earlier, an important new study by Tammy Tengs estimates the magnitude of this resource misallocation. In her doctoral dissertation at Harvard, Dr. Tengs notes that from a survey of 185 life-saving interventions: 
<P><blockquote>
	 Results indicate that we incur opportunity costs of approximately $31.1 billion, 60,200 premature deaths, or 636,000 years of life lost every year in order to maintain our present pattern of investments in these 185 life-saving interventions. At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars. This could be accomplished by simply attending to the cost-effectiveness of investment options.<sup>22</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Dr. Tengs notes, "[W]e pay a large price for this pattern of investments and policy makers would be well advised to examine whether retaining the status quo results in non-survival benefits that are worth the cost and loss of human life."<sup>23</sup>  John Graham observes bluntly, "This perverse pattern of investment amounts to 'statistical murder' of American citizens. Policy makers need to ask harder questions about whether our public health and environmental protection dollars are well spent."<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The bottom line:</b> If the current pattern of regulation and structure of costs continues, risks actually will increase for average Americans.
<p>
<b>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given this misuse of resources and the corresponding costs of current federal policies and priorities, policymakers and regulators should reconsider how to reduce real risks to Americans. The aim should be to provide more protection at less cost. A better distribution of scarce societal resources to achieve this goal would:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Improve risk decision-making and minimize inefficient federal spending.</b> Risk assessment methods need to be improved (for example, by using sound science), and agencies need to establish a clear distinction between assessing risks and deciding how to manage them. Federal agencies should work closely with the scientific community to improve risk assessment guidelines. Today, agencies too often allow policy decisions about how risk should be managed to influence how risk is determined. When a risk is identified, a policy decision is made about how to handle it. If certain federal toxin control efforts produce little or no benefit for society, however, they should be abandoned, since they waste resources that could be used better elsewhere. Other programs, such as fatal injury programs, also would be scrutinized to ensure that resources could not be used better elsewhere, such as for medical treatments.
<p>
<b><li>Require that decisions about how to manage risks be made with due consideration for scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns.</b> In those cases where governmental solutions are viewed as inevitable, regulators should be required to take into account all possible outcomes and potential side effects of their actions. Scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns all must be given due consideration in this process. Moreover, Congress should demand that regulators meet stringent standards of proof before allowing them to overrule individual action and choice. External peer review mechanisms and judicial review opportunities also should be established to guarantee accountability. Proper prioritization of serious risks will aid in this process.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Encourage market-based solutions that produce incentives to reduce risk.</b> Achieving a wealthier citizenry would do more to decrease risks and reduce mortality than most public programs. Better use of market pricing and strict enforcement of property rights claims through the common law system would produce risk-alleviating incentives. For example, by applying property rights to water usage in Scotland, river users have reduced pollution by others in the waterways since they have an economic incentive to conserve and keep clean the natural resources they now own.<sup>26</sup>  Fundamental reform of tort law that results in a fairer compensatory system and better deters harmful conduct without over-punishing behavior also would help achieve this goal.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Improve both public and private risk information efforts.</b> The public needs to understand the types of familiar risks they face everyday, such as being struck by lightning, and how these compare with unfamiliar risks, such as exposure to a particular chemical in the community. This would ensure that individuals possess the maximum amount of information to make wise, safety-conscious decisions on their own. For example, smoking, alcohol abuse, poor dietary standards, sun tanning, dangerous recreation activities and vehicles, and other potentially hazardous lifestyle habits are among the most risky activities engaged in by most Americans, according to experts. However, government regulation is rarely the solution and traditionally has not been the approach in these areas. An informed citizenry, with the liberty to make personal decisions, is the optimal goal.
<p>
<b><li>Give states and localities the flexibility to target resources more effectively to address the risks they face.</b> States and localities can target resources more precisely to the needs of their communities, such as sanitation, hazardous waste cleanup, and traffic safety. Moreover, they are more likely to know and be more responsive to the unique needs and concerns of their citizens than are distant federal regulators. Restricting federal efforts to clearly interstate and national concerns in those cases where private, state, and local efforts fail would be a much more effective division of responsibility.
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Eliminating every risk from life is impossible. But in pursuit of the mirage of a "risk-free" society, regulators oftentimes pursue quixotic and unattainable goals that place the lives of ordinary Americans at even greater risk. The traditional rhetoric surrounding the debate over risk -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is fraudulent. Regulations can kill, especially when they are formulated as a rash response to hypothetical risks and divert resources from other activities that would reduce real risks. The new rhetoric of risk regulation must be based on sound science, prioritization, and an understanding of the wealth-health trade-offs government regulations force on society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, not all federal risk regulations can be eliminated. But those that regulate illusory risks can and should be eliminated. Moreover, other regulations that alleviate small amounts of risk often can be crafted in better ways or carried out at the state or local level to ensure that they are cost-effective and truly beneficial. Obviously, there is no one panacea that policymakers can rely on in determining whether federal intervention is necessary. Judgment is needed. But if the proper tools and concepts are applied consistently when contemplating legislation or regulation of risk, those judgments would be much more sound than they are today. In the end, many more Americans would live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

<li>Aaron Wildavsky, "Trial and Error Versus Trial Without Error," in <I>Searching for Safety</I> (New Brunswick, Conn: Transaction Books, 1988), p. 38. Wildavsky referred to "those opportunities to reduce <I>existing</I> harms that society forgoes when it decides to delay or deny the introduction of a new substance of technology" as "opportunity benefits" since "opportunity costs" refers only to goods or services that might have been purchased with the same resources. "Opportunity benefits," on the other hand, focuses on the beneficial results that could have come about if a different path had been followed. <I>Ibid</I>., p. 39.<p>
<li>Although almost all risk experts agree this relationship holds over the long run, the short-run effects of economic wealth and personal health are disputed. That is, as "permanent income" (average income over the long run) increases or decreases over time, health risks and mortality generally decrease. See generally Wildavsky, "Richer Is Sicker Versus Richer Is Safer," in <I>Searching for Safety</I> , pp. 59-75. However, fluctuations in "transitory income" (short-term income changes during business cycle upturns and downturns) do not always exhibit a similar correlation. In fact, some scholars have noted that a perverse relationship exists between health/mortality risks and short-term increases in income brought on by improving economic conditions. For example, some ailments such as heart attacks, accidents, and cirrhosis tend to increase with improving economic times since they often are the result of an increased tendency and ability among individuals to consume greater quantities of luxuries that may have adverse health effects. See John D. Graham, Bei-Hung Chang, and John S. Evans, "Poorer Is Riskier," <I>Risk Analysis</I>, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1992), pp. 333-337. In general, though, these are health risks that individuals accept despite the side effects associated with them. More important, permanent income is generally a more important gauge of overall societal well-being and is hurt by federal policies that generate enormous costs and produce few benefits.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait is among the most important
challenges for American foreign policy in early 1996. Ever since
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the
United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating
Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of
force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and
even larger maneuvers are underway as Taiwan moves toward its
scheduled March 23 presidential election. China continues to reserve
the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare
independence. If a military clash were to occur, even a limited
one, tremendous damage would be done, both to Taiwan and to U.S.-China
relations. Failure to deter conflict also would be regarded in
Asia as a failure of U.S. leadership.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At stake in Taiwan is not only the peace and security of the region,
but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. With a population of
only 21 million, the ROC is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner,
right behind China itself. After martial law ended in 1987, the
ROC embarked on political reforms that soon will transform Taiwan
into a full democracy. Last December, free and fair elections
were held for the ROC Legislative Yuan<sup>1</sup>; and this March 23, Taiwan
will hold its first direct presidential election. The ROC is the
first full democracy in the history of the Chinese people. Taiwan
is thus a model for political reform on the mainland.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In response to the ROC's growing international stature, China
has mounted a campaign of diplomatic pressure and military intimidation
against Taiwan. On one level, these threats are directed at political
forces in Taiwan calling for independence from China<sup>2</sup>. But they
are aimed also at Taiwan's emerging democracy. Beijing's threats
have been reinforced by demonstrations of force, including large-scale
military exercises and tests of nuclear-capable missiles near
the ROC. These actions have not depressed the democratic enthusiasm
of the people of Taiwan, but they have weakened business confidence
on the island. Even larger military exercises will be held in
the days leading up to the March 23 presidential election.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Bill Clinton's failure to respond adequately to Chinese saber-rattling
in the South China Sea and against Taiwan fosters an impression
of American weakness. Several statements by Clinton Administration
officials to the effect that the U.S. will not defend Taiwan if
attacked are potentially even more destabilizing. Hard-liners
in Beijing have been encouraged to step up dangerous military
pressure against Taiwan. President Clinton therefore must take
strong but measured steps to convey to Beijing America's clear
interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Congress can
play an important role as well in reaffirming America's traditional
bipartisan support for the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Thus, the
Administration and Congress should:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
<li>Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
The perception that the U.S. would not respond to a Chinese attack
will only embolden Beijing.<BR>

<P>
<li>Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully.<BR>

<P>
<li>Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. China should be told it may face economic sanctions,
ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a
full U.S. economic embargo, and that the U.S. does not rule out
using force to defend Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li>Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li><B>Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act. These may include advanced air-to-air missiles,
conventional submarines, and missile defense systems. <BR>
</B>
<P>
<li><B>Maintain a balance of power in Asia favorable to the U.S. by
deploying missile defenses. </B>China's demonstrated willingness
to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan underscores
the need to defend U.S. forces in Asia from this threat. <BR>
</ul><BR>


<P>
<b>GROWING DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN: THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN ELECTIONS</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan is the foremost lawmaking branch of the ROC
government. The December 2 Legislative Yuan elections represented
a milestone in the democratic reform process begun by former President
Chiang Ching-kuo when he lifted martial law in 1987. The elections
emphatically demonstrated the deepening of Taiwan's own democratic
political culture. Today, Taiwan's democracy includes aspects
common to all advanced democracies: competitive multi-party competition,
professionally managed and transparent voting procedures, effective
public debate, and citizen faith in the election process. This
faith was illustrated by the impressive turnout of 67.65 percent
of Taiwan's 14.2 million voting-age citizens. This occurred without
compulsory voting laws. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The elections preserved the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party's narrow
majority in the 164-seat Legislative Yuan. The KMT won 85 seats,
but its total declined by 11 seats. The main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) made only modest gains, from 50 to 54.
Meanwhile, the New Party, a recently formed conservative party,
went from 0 to 21 seats. Because party discipline in Taiwan is
lax, the KMT will have to form coalitions in order to conduct
the business of government. Thus, the results of the election
offer prospects for the development of a culture of compromise,
a necessary element common to all advanced democracies.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The December 2 elections were judged universally to be fair and
democratic. On election day, an observer team organized by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> visited several polling stations in Central
Taipei, witnessing voting procedures that Taiwanese appeared to
regard as routine. There was little tension because the procedures
were well known. Confidence in the secrecy and security of the
ballots is well established. That evening, the Heritage delegation
visited the National Vote Tallying Center, where computerized
tallying produced national results well before 10:00 p.m. There
were no accusations of fraud to challenge the integrity of the
process. University of Florida Professor James Robinson also noted
that &quot;Taiwan at present compares favorably with its democratic
peers in conducting fair elections.&quot;<sup>3</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan elections were dominated by domestic issues.
Political and economic issues included criticism of KMT &quot;money
politics,&quot; a perceived slowdown in the economy, accusations
of government corruption, veterans benefits, and the personalities
of the candidates. In contrast to previous elections, many observers
noted that vote-buying was much less a problem in this election.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Independence and Intimidation. </B>China's military intimidation
played a lesser role in the December elections than many expected.
Some have noted that the impressive gains made by the New Party
(NP) and the defeat of one-third of the Democratic Progressive
Party's incumbents reflect opposition to Taiwan independence.
The NP strictly opposes independence and criticizes the KMT for
covertly seeking it, while the DPP advocates independence from
China despite Beijing's repeated threat to invade Taiwan if this
were to occur. In the middle of the spectrum between the NP and
the DPP, the KMT wants peaceful unification with a reformed mainland
over the long term but, in the interim, seeks to expand Taipei's
international recognition short of formal independence. The Heritage
delegation concluded that domestic issues played a far greater
role in voting preferences than did the independence issue. The
delegation also concluded that China's military threats did not
sway the Taiwanese people significantly. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>THE MARCH 23 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The democratic process begun by the legislative elections last
year will be consummated this year by the presidential elections
on March 23.<sup>4</sup> The front-runner in this election is KMT incumbent
President Lee Teng-hui. Lee is the first native-born Taiwanese
to become President and has followed his predecessor, President
Chiang Ching-kuo, in advancing democratic reforms. Lee has opposed
the DPP on the issue of independence from China but has sought
vigorously to raise Taiwan's international status by seeking to
join international organizations like the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the World Trade Organization, and the
United Nations. President Lee also has pressed for greater diplomatic
support from the United States. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Lee will face three opponents in the election. Peng Ming-min of
the Democratic Progressive Party is a former political exile and
is regarded as the intellectual godfather of the pro-independence
movement. Two other candidates come from factions of the KMT.
Lin Yang-kang, former President of Taiwan's Judicial Yuan, is
supported by the New Party, which opposes both independence and
Lee Teng-hui. Also running on an independent ticket is Chen Li-an,
former President of the Control Yuan, a government watchdog body.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CHINA'S THREAT TO PEACE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Over the last year, China has deliberately increased tension in
the Taiwan Strait. Beijing views Taipei's attempts to gain admittance
to the United Nations and President Lee's private visit to the
U.S. last June as efforts to advance the cause of an independent
Taiwan. However, China's leaders have an even greater fear: A
free and democratic Taiwan stands as a threat to the legitimacy
of the Chinese Communist Party's political dictatorship. Thus,
Taiwan's democracy and place in the world stand as important issues
in China's own ongoing political transition. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Threats of Missile Strikes. </B>Since 1994, China has mounted
three major military exercises near Taiwan. In September and October
1994, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted combined air,
land, and sea exercises on Chou Shan Island, about 60 miles south
of ROC-held Quemoy Island. At the time, Assistant Secretary of
State Winston Lord described these exercises as &quot;the most
expansive... that China has conducted in 40 or 50 years.&quot;
In June and July of last year, the PLA conducted a similar series
of exercises near Taiwan. These exercises concluded with the firing
of four 1,125-mile range DF-21 and two 375-mile range M-9 missiles
to an area about 100 miles north of the ROC.<sup>5</sup> Both missiles are
capable of carrying nuclear or chemical warheads. These tests
mark the first time China has used missiles to threaten an opponent.<sup>6</sup>
Finally, right before the Legislative Yuan elections, in late
November, Chinese President Jaing Zemin personally presided over
large-scale combined-arms amphibious and airborne assault exercises
designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan. These exercises involved
about 20,000 troops, in addition to about 40 ships and 100 aircraft.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China has scheduled more exercises for 1996 and has been deploying
forces to Fujian Province, across the strait from Taiwan, for
large-scale military exercises planned for late February.<sup>7</sup> These
exercises may involve up to 100,000 troops and China's most modern
combat aircraft, the Sukhoi SU-27 and J-8II jet fighters.<sup>8</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Beijing also has threatened to use force against Taiwan. Before
the December Legislative Yuan elections, China used the Hong Kong
press to discuss the possible invasion and occupation of one of
the ROC's offshore islands, followed by a naval blockade of the
Taiwan Strait. These threats were designed to compel Taipei to
begin reunification talks on Beijing's terms. Even more alarming,
former Clinton Administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles
Freeman, following meetings in China, reportedly has told the
Administration that while China &quot;prefers negotiation to combat,&quot;
it &quot;has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan
consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China does not have the capability to invade and conquer the ROC,
but it does have the capability to do significant harm. Last November's
amphibious exercise involved only a single PLA division, but the
effort required civilian ships to support the PLA Navy.<sup>10</sup> However,
the PLA can cause substantial damage to Taiwan by mining ports,
undertaking a limited blockade with its five nuclear-powered and
45 conventional-powered attack submarines, and conducting a terror
campaign with conventional missile strikes. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; To counter Chinese submarines, the ROC Navy has only two modern
conventional submarines. Moreover, the ROC lacks anti-missile
systems, and China conceivably could take Quemoy or Matsu, small,
fortified islands near the coast of China, albeit at heavy cost
to its invading forces. Even such limited PLA action might lead
to air battles that would reduce the number of ROC combat aircraft.
In addition to any physical damage, such a limited campaign against
Taiwan could depress public and economic confidence. Shipping
insurance rates would skyrocket, and foreign investors would be
deterred. ROC officials estimate that after the PLA missile tests
last July, capital flight amounted to $5 billion.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Unification By Force? </B>The PRC is stepping up its efforts
to intimidate the ROC, but it may be preparing for a more decisive
confrontation with Taiwan early in the next decade. In a speech
on January 30 Premier Li Peng, the second most powerful Chinese
leader, said that &quot;During the period of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan [years 1996 to 2000] the Chinese Government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau. Therefore, settling
the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese
people.&quot; Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that
the &quot;the important role to be played by the Army in taking
back Taiwan&quot; was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting
Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. This meeting reportedly also endorsed military modernization
plans, including a decision to build China's first aircraft carrier.<sup>11</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China indeed is modernizing its armed forces. Beijing has purchased
four advanced Kilo-class conventional submarines from Russia that
are far more capable than the older Soviet-based submarines currently
used by China. The PLA Navy is building modern missile-armed destroyers
and frigates. Reports of a pending deal in which China may buy
over 70 advanced Russian SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> fighters, which
will entail co-production of this aircraft, indicate the PLA could
have over 100 of this type in about five years.<sup>12</sup> This aircraft
has superior range and may be armed already with AA-11 <I>Archer</I>
air-to-air missiles, which would threaten the U.S. F-16s the ROC
plans to put into service in 1997<sup>13</sup>. Moreover, China may be seeking
to purchase Russian or Israeli AWACS early warning and air-combat
management aircraft, which would be essential in establishing
air superiority over the Taiwan Strait.<sup>14</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>WHY THE ROC DESERVES STEADFAST AMERICAN SUPPORT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though Washington ended formal diplomatic relations with Taipei
in favor of Beijing in 1978, a long-standing bipartisan consensus
in the U.S., expressed in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, has
supported strong informal ties with the ROC. There are three reasons
why maintaining strong relations with Taipei is in America's interest.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #1:</b> The ROC is America's seventh largest trading partner,
following immediately behind the PRC. In 1995, trade with the
ROC totaled $47 billion. While Taipei maintains a $5.8 billion
trade surplus with America in manufactured goods, the U.S. had
a surplus of $1.5 billion in the export of services in 1994. Taipei
has a good track record of responding to U.S. concerns about trade
barriers, though differences still exist in the areas of intellectual
property rights protection, access to banking and insurance markets,
and some tariffs. Nevertheless, The Heritage Foundation has rated
Taiwan's economy as the eighth freest in the world, right behind
the U.S.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #2:</b> The Republic of China's transition to full democracy
reflects America's own commitment to democracy. When democratization
is completed after the country's first direct presidential election
in March, the ROC deserves to be considered a democratic ally
of the United States. The persistence of the Taiwanese people
in building their own democratic institutions and traditions despite
internal and external pressures is a testament to their courage
and determination. The American people traditionally have admired
democracies and often have come to their aid when threatened.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #3:</b> Taiwan's democracy could have a positive influence
on China. China is experiencing a critical leadership transition
as President Jiang Zemin seeks to consolidate his power as Deng
Xiaoping fades from the scene. Over the last decade, Deng's economic
reforms have produced double-digit economic growth and expanded
economic freedom. Taiwan is well placed to advance this trend.
Despite the deep-seated political antipathy of China's leadership
toward Taiwan, both sides have rapidly increased their economic
and personal interaction in recent years. ROC-PRC trade now exceeds
$20 billion annually, and millions of Taiwanese have visited the
mainland for business and family reasons. The success of Taiwan's
democratic reforms could influence mainland attitudes toward political
reform in a positive way as more mainlanders learn how Taiwanese
enjoy both political freedom and economic prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>STRENGTHENING DETERRENCE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring China from taking military action against Taiwan will
be a major test of American leadership in Asia. Since 1979, three
American Presidents have provided the leadership necessary to
protect U.S. interests in cross-straits relations. That China
now feels emboldened to threaten military action against Taiwan
indicates that it senses political weakness in Washington. This
is understandable because the Clinton Administration has failed
to make clear to Beijing that its military moves are unacceptable.
When China occupied Philippine-claimed reefs in the South China
Sea in February 1995 &#173;&#173; causing alarm throughout Southeast
Asia &#173;&#173; the Clinton Administration did not issue a statement
of &quot;concern&quot; until the following May. When China &quot;tested&quot;
six nuclear-capable missiles only 100 miles north of Taiwan last
July, the Clinton Administration again did nothing but issue a
mild statement of &quot;concern.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration may have contributed to the uncertainty
in another way. In the October 30, 1995, issue of <I>U.S. News
&amp; World Report</I>, an unnamed State Department official discounted
the possibility of direct U.S. military action if Taiwan was attacked,
saying that &quot;we would not be in a position to react with
force. We would not elect to do that I'm sure.&quot;<sup>16</sup> Others in
the Administration have coined the term &quot;deliberate ambiguity&quot;
to describe U.S. policy in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
Late last year, former Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye
told Chinese officials that &quot;we don't know and you don't
know&quot; how the U.S. would respond to an attack against Taiwan.<sup>17</sup>
Is it any surprise that, only three months later, Beijing is readying
another series of large military exercises designed to intimidate
Taiwan? <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The United States cannot afford to continue this policy of timidity.
President Clinton and Congress must work together to rebuild confidence
in American leadership and strengthen deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. They should:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
Perhaps the most important message that Washington can send Beijing
is a forceful reaffirmation of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).
It was the intent of Congress in 1979 that the U.S. maintain the
ability to ensure that Taiwan's defense needs were met and that
China understand America's interest in a peaceful resolution of
Taiwan's future. The elements of the TRA which convey this intent
are:<BR>
<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
Sec. 2 (b): It is the policy of the United States &#173;&#173;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(3) to make clear that the United States decision to establish
relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation
that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(4) to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by
other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,
a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and
of grave concern to the United States;<BR>

<P>
(6) to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or
the social or the economic system, of the people of Taiwan. <BR>

<P>
Sec. 3 (a):... the United States will make available to Taiwan
such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as
may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability.<BR>

<P>
(c) The President is directed to inform the Congress promptly
of any threat to the security or the social or economic system
of the people of Taiwan and any danger to the interests of the
United States arising therefrom.<BR>
<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should remind China that these sections
of the TRA convey the clear intent of the American people. The
Administration also should make clear that the U.S. retains the
option to come to Taiwan's defense if it is attacked.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The TRA is a critical element in Washington's ability to deter
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. However, it is the Clinton Administration's
consistent weakness in the face of aggressive Chinese behavior
which threatens to undermine the value of the TRA. The Administration
should emphasize to Chinese officials that the TRA is a U.S. law
that guides American policy. To strengthen this message, early
in this legislative session, Congress should pass a joint resolution
reaffirming the TRA. Furthermore, it should insist that the Administration
fulfill its obligations under the Act, including its responsibility
to report to Congress any threats to the security of Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully. To bolster confidence
in Taipei, the Administration and Congress should acknowledge
Taiwan's emerging democracy. A former President or former Secretary
of State should be asked to lead the U.S. delegation to the inauguration
of the new ROC President. Taiwan's evolution toward democracy
belies the notion promoted by some Asians that democracy is not
suited to the Asian character.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At the same time, Washington should privately urge both Beijing
and Taipei to resume the cross-straits dialogue which began in
1991 but was suspended last year. Washington should make clear
to both sides that they bear the main responsibility in resolving
their differences. Nevertheless, Washington should stress regularly
to Beijing that, given Taiwan's democratic evolution, blatant
threats will prove increasingly counterproductive.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. The Clinton Administration should warn China privately
of the consequences that would follow direct military action against
Taiwan. The Administration should warn China that, depending on
the degree of damage it inflicts on Taiwan, it could expect sanctions
ranging from the ending of most-favored-nation trade status to
a total trade embargo with confiscation of all Chinese assets
in the U.S., and that the U.S. will not rule out using force to
defend Taiwan. China also should be told that these sanctions
would likely receive wide support in the U.S. Congress and that
the U.S. will lead a vigorous campaign to press other allies to
join them. Finally, China should be told that if it attacks Taiwan,
the U.S. will undertake a fundamental reevaluation of its relations
with China, in which policies of economic and political &quot;engagement&quot;
could give way to policies that focus on China's breach of the
peace. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan. The Clinton Administration
should order an aircraft carrier task group to be on station in
international waters near Taiwan during the period before and
after the March 23 election. This would demonstrate the U.S. commitment
to deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait and to maintaining
freedom of the seas.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act. It has been U.S. policy since 1979 to sell the ROC defensive
weapons sufficient to deter Chinese attack. As a response to China's
acquisition of the SU-27 from Russia in 1991, the Bush Administration
sold Taiwan 150 F-16 jet fighters in 1992. Should China's growing
military capabilities again threaten to tilt the military equilibrium
in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. should be prepared to sell Taiwan
defensive weapons to redress the balance. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's purchase of additional SU-27s and its intention to co-produce
many more of this aircraft are troubling in this regard. The F-16's
combat range and weapons already are inferior to those of the
SU-27. Washington should provide the ROC advanced armaments for
the F-16, such as the advanced medium-range AIM-120 AMRAAM missile,
giving ROC F-16s a technological margin that ensures deterrence.
In addition, the U.S. should allow U.S. shipbuilders to sell conventional
submarines to Taiwan. The U.S. is the only country willing to
supply this sorely needed defensive system to the ROC. Likewise,
in view of the PRC's missile tests near Taiwan last July, it is
essential that the U.S. offer Taiwan advanced versions of the
Patriot missile defense system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Should China attack Taiwan, the U.S. should be prepared &#173;&#173;
consistent with the TRA &#173;&#173; to resupply rapidly the ROC's
military weapons and munitions stocks. If China follows through
on threats to impose a naval blockade, the U.S. may have to supply
naval ordnance and replace ROC frigates that are lost. A naval
blockade also could lead to air battles, and the U.S. should be
prepared to advance delivery of F-16s and, more important, to
resupply combat missile stocks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Maintain a balance of power in Asia favorable to the U.S. by deploying
missile defenses. To deter China, the U.S. as soon as possible
should deploy not only theater missile defenses in Asia, but also
a national missile defense system to protect Americans. China's
willingness to use short-range nuclear-capable missiles to terrorize
countries in Asia was demonstrated by its missile tests 100 miles
north of Taiwan last July. Since then, Chinese officials reportedly
have told former Assistant Secretary Charles Freeman that China
may use conventionally armed missiles to terrorize Taiwan. Another
official stated that U.S. leaders &quot;care more about Los Angeles
than they do about Taiwan.&quot; Freeman reportedly viewed this
statement as a thinly veiled Chinese threat to use nuclear missiles
against the U.S. if it intervened to help protect Taiwan. Thus,
it is essential that the U.S. accelerate development and deployment
of theater anti-missile systems like the Navy's Upper Tier and
the Army's THAAD missiles. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats also make imperative the deployment of a national
missile defense system to defend Americans. As it threatens Taiwan
with missile strikes, China also may threaten the U.S. with nuclear
blackmail in the future. China is building up its nuclear missile
arsenal to include mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles.
A national missile defense system must be deployed to counter
this threat.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats against Taiwan are designed primarily to intimidate
the people on the eve of their first direct presidential election.
But they also stand as a challenge to the United States. Since
the 1950s, successive American Presidents have met this challenge
by ensuring adequate deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. But by reacting
timidly to China's military provocations in 1995, and even suggesting
that the U.S. would not come to Taiwan's assistance if attacked,
the Clinton Administration is undermining deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should begin immediately to reverse
this record of weakness. It should take steps to ensure that China
understands that the United States will not tolerate an attack
on Taiwan. Congress and the President should reaffirm the Taiwan
Relations Act, which will reassure Taiwan and warn China of U.S.
resolve, while urging both Beijing and Taipei to seek a peaceful
solution to their differences. If Beijing persists in its threats,
Washington should be prepared to deploy U.S. naval forces to help
deter Chinese military action against Taiwan. In the worst case,
if China does attack, the U.S. should be prepared to resupply
ROC military forces. Washington also must not rule out using U.S.
forces in Asia to help defend Taiwan.<BR>

<a href="tp11c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Major Uses of the Electromagnetic Spectrum
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades ago, the federal government nationalized one of the most important natural resources in existence. If this resource had been oil, coal, lumber, or steel, the American people would have been outraged. Yet this resource -- the electromagnetic wireless spectrum -- was simply unknown to most Americans, so few knew or cared. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the seven decades the federal government has held and parceled out the spectrum, many important and highly innovative technologies have been derived from it: AM and FM radio, broadcast television, cellular telephony, and satellite-delivered television, to name just a few. But the grossly inefficient and highly bureaucratic system of federal spectrum management also has slowed the introduction of many of these technologies by prohibiting or discouraging competition in the use of this valuable resource. In addition, the holders of wireless spectrum licenses have been denied the freedom accorded other types of communications technologies. For example, radio and television licensees continue to be denied First Amendment protections equal to those of print technologies, such as newspapers and magazines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A comprehensive bill deregulating much of the telecommunications industry was passed recently by Congress and signed by President Clinton this February. But this new law focuses primarily on wireline industries and issues (such as telephony and cable television) and ignores many equally important issues within the wireless sector of the industry (including cellular, satellite, and television broadcasting).<sup>1</sup>  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) did manage to force a last-minute debate over a portion of the bill that would give away large portions of the spectrum to a broadcast industry making the transition from analog to digital television. Dole argued that this giveaway would constitute "a big, big corporate welfare project"<sup>2</sup> because it sacrificed as much as $70 billion in potential revenues at a time when Americans are being asked to tighten their belts to help balance the federal budget.<sup>3</sup>  While this provision was not changed, Senator Dole's efforts did force supporters of the bill to offer to hold hearings in the future on legislation to reverse this misguided policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the defective spectrum management system left unaddressed in this round of telecommunications reform is to be remedied, Congress must do more than simply pass legislation auctioning off the spectrum now set to be given away at no cost to the broadcast industry. While auctioning the broadcast spectrum is a crucial first step, effective spectrum reform legislation will require Congress to go much further and:
<p><ol>
<li><b> Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b> Current holders of spectrum should be granted an absolute property right in their current allocation, not just licenses to use the spectrum as regulators see fit. Giving industry this flexibility would result in more efficient and innovative use of the spectrum resource.
<p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), the two federal agencies responsible for managing the spectrum, should be required to allocate and auction off as much of the spectrum as possible. Congress should specify that any new spectrum property for which there is a competing claim, including spectrum recently set aside for the broadcast industry, must be sold in an auction process. This will guarantee more rapid deployment of the spectrum to new users who value it most highly.
<p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are accorded equally to all media.</b> Electronic media and technologies that utilize the wireless spectrum traditionally have been held to different standards under the First Amendment. This must change, especially as the lines between technologies begin to blur. There is no justification for treating speech that is transmitted electronically any differently from the printed word.
<p>
<li><b> Transfer all remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to the courts, private entities, and an independent body.</b> Once spectrum privatization is complete, there will be no need for continued oversight by either the FCC or the NTIA. Coordination problems can be handled by the courts, private industry coordination organizations, and a small administrative body if needed.
 </ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If Congress fails to improve the current telecommunications reform with comprehensive wireless reform, it will have failed to deregulate the entire industry. This means wireless technologies and industries will remain overregulated relative to wireline industry, and placed at a competitive disadvantage. The practical result of this distortion will be to blunt efficiency and entrepreneurship. The result: fewer new jobs and more costly and more limited services for the consumer.
<p>
<h4>WHAT IS "THE SPECTRUM," AND HOW IS IT MANAGED TODAY?</h4>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="tp11c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Major Uses of the Electromagnetic Spectrum<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"The spectrum," as it is generally known, is made up of "radiated electromagnetic waves (radio waves) [which] permit the transmission and reception of information over a distance -- even through empty space -- without the use of wires."<sup>4</sup>  In essence, a collection of these waves, which vary in strength and frequency, can constitute a single channel along which distinct information can be transmitted. If much information is to be sent at once, a channel requires more spectrum space -- or "bandwidth" -- to be transmitted. For example, a broadcast video signal requires more bandwidth than a cellular voice signal. However, certain channels can be used to deliver many different types of signals, and also can be used by different parties in different geographical areas. For example, a television channel in Washington, D.C., can be reused in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and many other metropolitan areas. As spectrum experts Charles L. Jackson and Dale N. Hatfield note, "[T]he radio spectrum resource can be shared by many simultaneous users by taking advantage of its frequency, time and space dimensions."<sup>5</sup>  In other words, because the transmission distance for most spectrum frequencies is limited, the same channel can be used by different carriers in different locations if they are far enough apart. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain channels may even be used within the same region to deliver multiple types of signals simultaneously through a process known as "spectrum sharing" or "overlay."  Digital compression technologies facilitate this process by squeezing more space out of the same spectrum channel so that it may be used by more than one entity. Spectrum experts often speak of the "digitalization" of spectrum as a major breakthrough because it will expand significantly the number of spectrum uses and users as bandwidth becomes more abundant.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Older and less efficient analog transmission technologies still dominate much of the spectrum, however. Analog technologies utilize wave modulations that are susceptible to interference problems. Digitized transmission, on the other hand, breaks down waves into numbers and codes that can be encoded and decoded to transmit information. As this process becomes increasingly sophisticated, signals can be sent much more clearly, rapidly, and efficiently than analog signals.
<p>
<b>A Short History of Spectrum Management in the United States </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the early decades of this century, the wireless spectrum was left unregulated. As both public and private use of the spectrum grew, however, government officials became concerned about what has been labeled "chaos in the spectrum."  In other words, policymakers feared that unregulated use of this new and important resource would cause signal quality to deteriorate to a point where no one would be able to communicate effectively. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After numerous complaints from the U.S. Navy about such interference, Congress passed the Radio Act of 1912. This granted the federal government the ability to allocate licenses among users for specific spectrum allocations. The entire process was geared to assuring military users the best parts of the spectrum, leaving private users with nearly useless channels. Things grew worse during World War I, when the Navy took control of the entire spectrum. Although the Navy was forced to relinquish control in 1919, the Department of Commerce retained licensing power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This licensing power was limited. For example, the Department of Commerce could not charge for use of a license or restrict use once a license was granted. Not surprisingly, spectrum users began applying for as much of the spectrum as they possibly could, knowing there was no cost associated with doing so. This led to genuine interference, or "chaos," problems within the spectrum, leading to demands by policymakers and industry officials for more legislative intervention. Economist Jora R. Minasian aptly noted in 1975 that this interference "was not due to any inherently particular technological characteristics of radio emissions, but to the fact that rights to use of the frequency spectrum, rights of radiation, were ill-defined."<sup>7</sup>  Sixteen years before Minasian wrote these words, Nobel economist Ronald H. Coase pointed to the same problem in a famous 1959 article on the Federal Communications Commission. 
<blockquote><p>
	 [T]he real cause of trouble was that no property rights were created in these scarce frequencies. A private-enterprise system cannot function properly unless property rights are created in resources, and, when this is done, someone wishing to use a resource has to pay the owner to obtain it. Chaos disappears; and so does the government except that a legal system to define property rights and to arbitrate disputes is, of course, necessary. But there is certainly no need for the kind of regulation which we now find in the American radio and television industry.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Professor Thomas Hazlett of the University of California-Davis notes that the legitimate chaos evident during the 1921-1923 period, when calls for government control were multiplying, "was, in essence, an outcome of government control: over 500 broadcasters were... bunched up all at the same point on the spectrum to which they had been directed by the Commerce Department, and operations were not always perfectly synchronized."<sup>9</sup>  Minasian agrees: "No attempts were made prior to May, 1923, to assign a separate channel to each station, or to provide geographic separation of the stations operating on the same channels, or to provide mutually exclusive times of operation. The wave lengths were assigned to all in a group.... This policy, coupled with a liberal policy for issuing licenses to amateurs, resulted in interference.... "<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Radio Act of 1912 and the administrative decisions that flowed from it had two main effects. First, it encouraged military use of the spectrum at the expense of private broadcasters, leaving them little room to operate effectively. Second, it failed to create a private marketplace in spectrum rights that could have solved the ensuing interference and chaos problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these impediments, property rights in the spectrum were developing. Professor Hazlett explains that while federal regulators, legislators, and industry officials worked together to pre-empt the institution of a property rights regime, some judges were taking steps to establish property rights. As an illustration, Hazlett points out that in one 1926 court case, <I>Tribune Co. v. Oak Leaves Broadcasting Station</I>, "the classic interference problem was encountered, litigated, and overcome, using no more than existing common-law precedent."<sup>11</sup>  In this case, Judge Francis S. Wilson adjudicated a dispute between two broadcasters who faced an interference dilemma. Judge Wilson argued that once an entity had established a presence in a given allocation within the spectrum that user had a <I>de facto</I> property right in that allocation. By establishing this common law precedent to protect property rights in the spectrum, the decision effectively rendered the interference problem moot.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some immediately recognized the power of this precedent-setting decision and welcomed it. Others, in the industry and in government, feared that it meant they would not be guaranteed a comfortable, ologopolistic market setting (that is, a non-competitive market in which both the regulator and the regulated entities were satisfied with control of entry and comfortable market share, respectively).<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hazlett suggests this was not an accident. During Herbert Hoover's tenure as Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s, large incumbent broadcasters worked with Hoover to establish a "public interest" paradigm of federal regulation and control of the spectrum to replace the emerging common law, property rights-based paradigm. Basically, Hoover and the large broadcasters argued publicly that, despite the clear failings of past legislative efforts and the potential property rights solution developing in the courts at the time, only federal regulation of the spectrum could eliminate the chaos that existed during this period.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This pressure eventually led to the adoption of the Radio Act of 1927, giving the federal government complete operating control over and ownership of the spectrum. Under the 1927 Act, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was established and given the power to grant three-year licenses in exchange for certain public service requirements. Licenses would be granted (and revoked) in accordance with "the public interest, convenience, or necessity."  No more specific definition of what constituted "the public interest" was given.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Hazlett notes, the creation of the FRC and the public interest paradigm was the answer to broadcasters' prayers: "[I]t immediately grandfathered rights for major broadcasters, while eliminating marginal competitors and all new entry."<sup>13</sup>  Furthermore, Hazlett notes that the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> argued at the time what should have been evident to everyone: "The point seems clear that the Federal Radio Commission has interpreted the concept of public interest so as to favor in actual practice one particular group. While talking in terms of the 'public interest, convenience, and necessity' the commission actually chose to further the ends of the commercial broadcasters."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, little has changed since the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> printed these words in 1935. When the Federal Communications Commission was formed in 1934, the FRC was folded into the FCC along with its public interest powers.<sup>15</sup>  Throughout the years, the agency has developed highly haphazard, inflexible, and inefficient techniques to manage the spectrum resource.
<p><b>The Spectrum Scarcity and Interference Myths</b><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before discussing the pitfalls of the current regulatory approach, it is important to debunk the myths used to justify the disastrous spectrum management techniques employed by the FCC since its inception. These myths are (1) that the spectrum is scarce and (2) that private ownership would create interference problems. Both arguments are fatally flawed.
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Scarcity Myth.</b> The scarcity of the spectrum is irrelevant and cannot serve as a credible basis for federal ownership and management.<sup>16</sup>  As Coase has explained: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]t is a commonplace of economics that almost all resources used in the economic system (and not simply radio and television frequencies) are limited in amount and scarce, in that people would like to use more than exists. Land, labor, and capital are all scarce, but this, of itself, does not call for government regulation. It is true that some mechanism has to be employed to decide who, out of the many claimants, should be allowed to use the scarce resource. But the way this is usually done in the American economic system is to employ the price mechanism, and this allocates resources to users without the need for government regulation.<sup>17</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The scarcity rationale is even more irrelevant today as digital technologies move America into an age of "boundless bandwidth" and "spectrum surplus," as technology visionary George Gilder is fond of saying.<sup>18</sup>  "Why have... gloomy, scarcity-based forecasts proved so wrong?"  asks Gilder."  Because in each case, advances in microchip design tools, integration of more transistors on single chips, improved design of radio frequency systems and new antenna technology led to the creation of better systems at higher frequencies. "<sup>19</sup> Lawrence Gasman, president of Communications Industry Researchers and author of <I>Telecompetition</I>, agrees: "With lower-power communications, data compression, and practical communications at high frequencies, spectrum may still be scarce, but it is not as scarce as it once was, and it is becoming less scarce all the time."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Interference Myth.</b> The interference justification for federal spectrum management is equally flawed. As Hazlett cogently points out:
<blockquote><p>
	Economists, political scientists, and lawyers generally agree that the interference rationale for licensure in "the public interest" is nonsensical. The interference problem is widely recognized as one of defining separate frequency "properties"; it is logically unconnected to the issue of who is to harvest those frequencies. To confuse the definition of spectrum rights with the assignment of spectrum rights is to believe that, to keep intruders out of (private) backyards, the government must own (or allocate) all the houses.<sup>21</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas G. Krattenmaker and Lucas A. Powe, authors of <I>Regulating Broadcast Programming</I>, concur: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]nterference, like scarcity... is a bogeyman. All resources are subject to interference in the sense that their value will decline if everyone attempts to use them at once. This is why governments recognize property rights (which include the right to exclude others from using) in resources exchanged through the marketplace. Interference will... destroy the value of any resource, but usually the government does not choose to displace the market to prevent interference. Two people cannot comfortably sit at the same time in the same desk chair. Yet this fact has not led government to parcel out the right to sit in a chair. Rather, ownership of the chair is taken to confer authority to exclude others from sitting in it, no matter how eager they may be to do so.<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To illustrate the absurdity of both the scarcity and interference rationales for asymmetrical regulation of the broadcast industry, the authors further note: 
<p><blockquote>
	 It was as though Congress, having realized that paper is scarce and that "interference" occurs when two or more people write simultaneously on the same sheet of paper, had declared that the government owned all the paper in the United States. A Federal Paper Commission would then be necessary to decide how much paper would be available for (say) books and how much for (say) wallpaper. The Commission would further choose who was permitted to engage in book publishing.<sup>23</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Recent court and FCC decisions support these sentiments. In the 1986 case <I>Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC</I>,<sup>24</sup> Judge Robert Bork, writing for a majority of the D.C. Circuit Court, argued that spectrum scarcity was a "universal fact" of economics and therefore could not serve as a valid basis for lesser First Amendment treatment of broadcasting. Likewise, in the FCC's 1987 <I>Syracuse Peace Council</I><sup>25</sup> decision revoking the Fairness Doctrine, the agency argued that when "analyzing the appropriate First Amendment standard to be applied to the electronic press, the concept of scarcity . .. .. is irrelevant."<sup>26</sup>  The Commission went on to note that "We believe the function of the electronic press in a free society is identical to that of the printed press and that, therefore, the constitutional analysis of government control of content should be no different."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the scarcity rationale nor the interference rationale for federal spectrum management can be used credibly to support the continued socialization of spectrum or its special regulatory treatment.
<p>
<b>"Zoning" Delays Introduction of New Technologies </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the fact that neither scarcity nor interference can serve as legitimate justification for federal spectrum ownership, the FCC continues to employ the same outmoded spectrum management techniques it has used for the past seven decades. As use of the spectrum grew and new technologies developed, the FCC began to partition the spectrum into various blocks called allocations. Within each spectrum allocation, the FCC specifies how that particular block of spectrum may be utilized. FM radio, for example, is allocated a block of spectrum between 88 mhz and 108 mhz, and the commercial paging block is found between 931 mhz and 932 mhz. Broadcast television, satellite dish television, and cellular telephony all have similar block allocation arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within each of these block allocations, the FCC then subdivides the allocation geographically. These subdivisions, known as allotments, are important because they enable spectrum to be reused in many different geographic areas. After the agency divides the spectrum into allocations and then subdivides it into geographic allotments, it parcels out specific spectrum assignments in the form of spectrum licenses. These licenses provide a specific legal right to use the spectrum, but only for the listed use. In other words, a television broadcaster is licensed only to broadcast video programming; it cannot offer cellular, paging, or other types of communications services even though there may be a large potential market for these services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, this system has proven extraordinarily inefficient and time-consuming. As the Congressional Budget Office notes:
<blockquote><p>
	Block allocations take a long time to establish, and once established are difficult to change. Difficulty in responding to changes in technologies and consumer preferences can leave parts of the spectrum underused. In some instances, a limited allocation of spectrum gives license holders control over prices and accompanying high profits or rents. Accordingly, the radio spectrum is not distributed among different users in an economically efficient way. Under the block allocation system there is no smooth path that permits spectrum to move easily from lower to higher value services.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This parceling system has not changed fundamentally since the FCC began managing the spectrum in the 1920s. In essence, the FCC is "zoning" the spectrum, to borrow the terminology of real estate land management. Those firms lucky enough to receive a license must be content with a single use; innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Worse yet, the assignment and licensing process is prone to the same criticisms economists level against all government licensing schemes. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation working group recently found, "Across-the-board, the Commission's licensing process is characterized by procrastination, equivocation, and seemingly endless delay. Unnecessary delay, ultimately found to be in the public interest, imposes enormous costs on the industry and the national economy."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>30</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) by 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, such costly delays have been the norm, since licenses have been doled out to the industry through "comparative hearings" in which applicants for a license must demonstrate their worthiness to FCC bureaucrats. "Comparative hearings can be long, burdensome, and inflexible. Years can elapse as lawyers present the merits of each side," notes Citizens for a Sound Economy Vice President James Gattuso. 
<blockquote><p>
	Perhaps worse, even after this costly procedure [estimated to cost about $130,000 for the applicant and another $5,000 for the FCC<sup>32</sup>], it is often difficult or impossible for the Commission to determine which applicant will best serve the "public interest."  The Commission may find itself not only trying to decide which applicant is most sincere in its expressed desire to serve the public, and which has the financial resources to do so, but also may have to pass judgment on the applicant's entire business plan to determine it would meet the needs of consumers.<sup>33</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the Commission must engage in <I>de facto</I> industrial policy to distribute licenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem was not alleviated when Congress authorized the FCC in the 1980s to begin using lotteries instead of comparative hearings to distribute licenses. Thought to be a cheaper and more rapid way to expedite licenses to the industry, lotteries simply awarded them randomly to a lucky few among the thousands of applicants. In fact, note Evan R. Kwerel and John R. Williams at the FCC's Office of Policy and Plans, "Because the cost of applying was low and the licenses were quite valuable, large numbers of applicants chose to enter the FCC lotteries. For example, there were nearly 400,000 applications for cellular licenses -- so many that the shelves broke at the FCC processing center in Gettysburg."<sup>34</sup>  Furthermore, as noted by Jonathan Blake, a partner at Covington & Burling and former President of the Federal Communications Bar Association, "because lotteries were every person's chance for a big payoff and winners routinely sold their licenses as soon as possible to real operators, it was soon observed that lotteries led to private auctions. In turn, this led to the question: why shouldn't the government conduct the auctions?"<sup>35</sup>
<p>
<b>The Auction Alternative Becomes Reality in the 1990s</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the FCC and Congress began to realize that the problems associated with comparative hearings and lotteries demanded a solution. In 1993, Congress finally gave the FCC authority to auction certain commercial uses of the spectrum, although certain types of spectrum were excluded, most notably broadcast spectrum. In general, auctions present a less costly and more efficient allocation mechanism. 
<ul><p>
<li> As the Congressional Budget Office noted in 1992, "Compared with other methods of assignment... auctions are faster, less costly to society, produce more federal revenues, and are more likely to place licenses in the hands of the applicants who value them most."<sup>36</sup> 
<p>
<li>As Peter C. Cramton of the University of Maryland notes, "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative hearings."<sup>37</sup> 
<p>
<li>The superiority of auctioning over alternative allocation mechanisms is perhaps best described in the most recent <I>Economic Report of the President</I>: "When the government does not auction off but simply assigns spectrum licenses for free, it is giving away public resources worth billions of dollars. But more than revenue is at stake. Auctions can help promote economic efficiency, by ensuring that spectrum is deployed in the highest-return uses, including emerging growth industries that entail innovative technologies and services."<sup>38</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As of early February 1996, spectrum auctions have brought in over $15 billion to the U.S. Treasury. As a recent headline in <I>The New York Times</I> says, "The Sky Seems to Be the Limit."<sup>39</sup>  More important, however, hundreds of spectrum properties have been assigned much more rapidly than would have been possible using comparative hearings or lotteries.
<p>
<b>The Resistance to Auctions </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the enormous success of auctions, Congress continues to allow certain spectrum uses to escape the auction process. Specifically, due to an exemption built into the original 1993 auctioning authority, services that do not collect "compensation from subscribers," such as broadcasting, are exempted.<sup>40</sup>  The broadcast industry, which has lobbied Congress intensely to win and keep this provision, does not want auctions to be applied uniformly to all new uses of spectrum because it would force broadcasters to pay for additional spectrum licenses they are set to receive free of charge from the FCC in the near future as part of a plan put in place a few years ago by the Commission. 
<P>
<b>The Taxpayer Cost of Limits on Auctions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The value of the spectrum to be given away has been estimated by the FCC to be somewhere between $10 billion to $70 billion. Yet the recently passed Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not alter this plan by demanding auctions. Instead of making tens of billions available for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief through auction of this spectrum, Congress will force Americans to shell out more of their own money to pay down the national debt while broadcasters receive a free handout of spectrum assets. Worse yet, by giving additional spectrum away to broadcasters, Congress will not equalize the treatment of communications providers; in practice, it will create a highly uneven telecommunications playing field.<sup>41</sup>  The unfairness of this giveaway is summarized by <I>Los Angeles Times</I> columnist Michael Schrage: "Do we give farmers free farmland when they want to grow new kinds of crops?  So why should the FCC give spectrum to broadcasters who want to grow new business?"<sup>42</sup>  Schrage argues it would be "like giving the Baby Bells and the cable companies `free' fiber optics as they rewire America."<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although this blatant example of corporate welfare became an issue during the waning days of the battle over the comprehensive telecom bill early this year, it did not prevent the legislation's eventual passage, although Senate Majority Leader Dole did hold out for promises of hearings and introduction of a bill this year to rectify this situation.
<P>
<b>Why Auctions Alone Are Not Enough</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is important to note that auctions alone cannot solve the "zoning" problem discussed above. As Hazlett notes, "while auctions can distribute licenses in a relatively low-cost manner, they do nothing to distribute spectrum more efficiently. The federal government still micromanages markets, protecting the interests of incumbent licensees and doling out entry rights to new players only after years of frustration and struggle."<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, while it was wise of Congress and the FCC to move forward with auctions in 1993, Congress should not have allowed the FCC to limit the use of auctioned spectrum merely to personal communications services (PCS) uses. Instead, winning bidders should have been given the right to use purchased spectrum however they wished. Likewise, if Congress decides to reverse its current position and go forward with auctions of additional broadcast spectrum licenses, it should not require the FCC to box winning bidders into providing certain types of digital broadcast programming that may be technologically irrelevant in a few years. Achieving maximum efficient use of the spectrum resource means granting full flexibility in use to winning bidders -- in fact, to all spectrum users.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In sum, the FCC should not be selling licenses at all. It should be selling property rights. Licenses traditionally have restricted use, while property rights would define boundaries within which owners could use their allocations in any way they thought economically efficient and profitable. Moreover, a regime of auctions and property rights could encourage a number of alternative uses for many spectrum licenses, unlike the current system, which is too rigid to allow innovative alternatives to develop freely. As Coase explained in 1959:
<blockquote><P>
	Quite apart from the misallocations which are the result of political pressures, an administrative agency which attempts to perform the function normally carried out by the pricing mechanism operates under two handicaps. First of all, it lacks the precise monetary measure of benefit and cost provided by the market. Second, it cannot, by the nature of things, be in possession of all the relevant information possessed by the managers of every business which uses or might use radio frequencies, to say nothing of the preferences of consumers for the various goods and services in the production of which radio frequencies could be used.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thirty-six years later, Peter Pitsch, an adjunct fellow at the <a href="/pff">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a> and former chief of staff at the FCC, testified before Congress that this was still the case: "[T]he FCC like other central planners lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. [D]etermining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast amounts of continually updated information that is hopelessly beyond the abilities of the administrative process."<sup>46</sup>  In addition, Pitsch notes that this problem has grown worse with time since, "In the case of spectrum, the information required to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other areas of the economy, because the pace of technological development has created a raft of new uses for wireless communications and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed."<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<h4>SIDE EFFECTS OF FEDERAL SPECTRUM MISMANAGEMENT: THE "PUBLIC INTEREST" STANDARD AND CONTENT REGULATION</h4>
<hr> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic costs associated with federal spectrum mismanagement are high. Equally as damaging, however, is the degree to which federal regulators have used their authority to intrude on licensees' ability to operate freely once they have received their allocations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As mentioned earlier, when the Radio Act of 1927 became law, federal regulators were given the power to issue licenses if they found it was in the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."  This meant that regulators were given broad discretion when determining who would receive a license and how they could use that license. Unfortunately, the term "public interest" has never been clearly defined. As Coase noted over 35 years ago, "The phrase... lacks any definite meaning. Furthermore, the many inconsistencies in Commission decisions have made it impossible for the phrase to acquire a definite meaning in the process of regulation."<sup>48</sup>  More recently, critics have pointed out that regulation in the "public interest" has come to mean whatever regulators want it to mean at a given time.<sup>49</sup>  Hence, the "public interest" or "public trustee" model of regulation that sprang up around broadcasting gave regulators the ability to exert unusual influence and require that special demands be met as a condition of license renewal.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, using the public interest rationale as a defense, in 1949 the FCC instituted the inappropriately named fairness doctrine. This doctrine required radio and television broadcasters to "afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of public importance."<sup>51</sup>  Instead of promoting the discussion of conflicting views and free speech in general, however, the fairness doctrine stifled it. In fact, over the span of its 40-year existence, it has been used as a tool of blatant political intimidation and influence backed by the threat of license revocation for failure to comply with the political whims of the day.<sup>52</sup>  The Reagan Administration FCC repealed the doctrine in 1987, citing First Amendment concerns and the fact that program diversity (informational, educational, religious, and entertainment fare) had increased steadily over time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the public trustee model has allowed the FCC both to demand that broadcasters restrict the amount of commercial airtime during children's viewing hours and to require that they air greater amounts of children's programming. Congress made this worse when it passed the Children's Television Act of 1990, which encouraged the FCC to expand regulations demanding a certain minimum number of hours of children's programming.<sup>53</sup>  Despite the noble intentions of policymakers and regulators intent on improving broadcast quality, these efforts have proven futile, even counterproductive. Because the public trustee social compact between broadcasters and regulators is kept intact by noble-minded but ineffective rules, industry competition is discouraged. If Congress continues to be content with half-hearted efforts to squeeze the most out of this regulatory arrangement, broadcast quality will never improve substantially. It is only greater competition within the field of video programming, not more restrictive social compacts and regulations, that can ensure improvement in the overall quality of broadcast fare over time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Making a Mockery of the First Amendment.</b> Even worse, such rules create an unfortunate schism within communication jurisprudence by ignoring First Amendment protections. Although most government attempts to impose prior restraints or requirements on speech constitute a <I>prima facie</I> violation of the First Amendment's mandate that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,"<I>54</I> holders of spectrum allocations do not enjoy similar speech protections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Basically, once federal regulators rejected property rights and chose instead the public interest paradigm, they found it easier to regulate the electronic press (such as television and radio) in ways they could not regulate the print press (such as newspapers, magazines, and newsletters). As Krattenmaker and Powe argue, "by adopting public ownership of the spectrum and administrative control over its uses, Congress chose a legal regime for broadcasting that differs radically from the law that governs every other mass communications medium in the United States. Congress thus put its imprimatur on the twin myths that scarcity and interference are phenomena unique to broadcasting and that scarcity and interference necessitate administrative control of the quality of broadcasts."<sup>55</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequently, although the print press traditionally has been accorded strict First Amendment protection from government efforts to manipulate speech and content, the electronic press has been accorded only secondary rights.<sup>56</sup>  First Amendment scholar Timothy Dyk notes that "it is reasonably clear that none of the programming rules or policies [applied to broadcasters] would be constitutional if applied to the print press."<sup>57</sup>  Timothy Dyk points to a number of cases that have invalidated legislative attempts to demand access to print media.<sup>58</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Therefore, Krattenmaker and Powe contend that content regulations such as the fairness doctrine, the Children's Television Act of 1990, and other similar rules should be repealed because "no proffered distinction for treating broadcasting differently from print justifies a different regulatory regime. Accordingly, all content regulation of broadcasting that could not be similarly applied to print or other mass communications media properly ought to be regarded as impermissible under the First Amendment."<sup>59</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regulators like to pretend they do not violate First Amendment standards. They argue that they are only operating within their statutorily defined powers to issue and renew spectrum licenses under the public interest standard they have sworn to uphold. Yet the license renewal process itself gives the government the ability to censor by threatening license revocation or fines. Although this is rare, it has occurred. It is the equivalent of regulatory extortion and flies in the face of traditional First Amendment thinking, because the government has no more right to demand certain types of speech than it has to restrict them.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A final and equally unacceptable justification for differential First Amendment treatment of broadcasters is that an individual or firm must obtain a license from the FCC before starting a broadcast station, whereas this is not the case with newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and the like. Yet, as mentioned above, licensing itself represented the first unjustifiable intervention by government into this arena and therefore cannot be used credibly to justify further mischief by federal regulators. If a property rights regime had been allowed to develop, no differential treatment would be allowed by the courts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, even if one accepts that there might be some role for the government in licensing spectrum, it does not follow that government should regulate its use as it now does. As noted legal commentator and newspaper columnist Bruce Fein says, "A lawyer needs a license to practice law, yet the government does not force a lawyer to spend equal time defending clients of opposite views. It is patently absurd to suggest that a license requirement in an industry is enough to allow the taking away of First Amendment rights."<sup>61</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hence, it is only the continuing belief in the scarcity rationale of federal spectrum management that continues to prop up this unconstitutional house of cards. If this rationale were rejected by the courts, all content regulations would likely fall as well. Although the scarcity rationale has been cited numerous times by the courts and Congress to justify content regulation of electronic media,<sup>62</sup> given the combination of its technological irrelevance and the recognition by the courts and many academics that it fails to justify broadcasting's unique treatment, it obviously no longer serves to justify content regulation.<sup>63</sup>
<p>
<h4>FOUR STEPS TO A FREE MARKET IN SPECTRUM</h4>
<hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If policymakers want to bring an end to this disastrous system of spectrum management, piecemeal reforms will not help. Only radical reform can succeed. The four key components of comprehensive and revolutionary spectrum reform are as follows:
<ol><p>
<li><b>Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b>
<blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Current holders of spectrum should be granted full flexibility to provide whatever type of service they want, however they want, whenever they want to consumers. There is no justification for continuing the rigid zoning restrictions on spectrum use that have evolved through seven decades of bureaucratic mismanagement. Americans are being denied access to countless innovative goods and services simply because spectrum holders have no incentive or ability to offer them. Although the opportunity costs associated with such rigid regulations are unquantifiable, it is reasonable to assume the U.S. economy is losing billions of dollars of economic activity. Providing full spectrum flexibility therefore will guarantee an increase in jobs, exports, and overall economic output. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, as long as spectrum remains a quasi-socialized public resource, it cannot be allocated efficiently or put to the best possible use. In essence, government cannot manage something as complex as the electromagnetic spectrum efficiently because bureaucratic processes are not suited to the task. What is needed, beyond flexibility in use, is a proven allocation mechanism that allows more effective utilization of the spectrum resource. A property right in the spectrum is the answer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to granting full flexibility in use, Congress could privatize the wireless spectrum by giving current holders a property right in their allocation. This means spectrum holders would no longer lease their allocation from the federal government, but instead would own it outright -- able to use it (or sell it) as they see fit. This also means that all arbitrary federal regulatory oversight of the spectrum would end. Federal regulators would be responsible only for enforcing technical trespass violations and disputes that arose between adjoining holders of spectrum.<sup>64</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Auctions should be applied across the board to every spectrum use for which there is a mutually exclusive claim or that has not yet been allocated by the government. Congress should create the following three-step process by which spectrum can be allocated more effectively and auctioned off to move toward a property rights regime:
<p><blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 1: Efficiently assign and allocate underutilized spectrum.</b> Currently, much of the spectrum managed by the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration is undistributed or underutilized.<sup>65</sup>  Large and valuable parcels that could be deployed for private sector use by the FCC, and especially by the NTIA, are lying dormant or are hoarded by less efficient users. Congress should demand that unallocated private-sector spectrum and underutilized public spectrum be allocated immediately. In essence, any time a party files for claim to such spectrum, that party should be granted the right to use it as it sees fit. However, when competing claims for the same spectrum allocation exist, or when the public sector refuses to give up spectrum, the following two steps will be necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 2: Mandate that auctions be used where any competing claim for spectrum exists.</b> For all potential uses of spectrum for which there are competing claims, auctions should be utilized to allocate the spectrum. Firms would file plans of their bidding proposals with the FCC and then post bonds proving they have enough capital to bid credibly for the given allocation. The Commission also could establish competitive bidding rules (as it did in past PCS auctions) to ensure that bidding collusion does not take place. These auctions would not be limited to one-time events, but would be ongoing as spectrum claims developed and multiplied.<sup>66</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This policy should be employed for all new mutually exclusive claims for use of a particular spectrum allocation. This includes the rights to the second six-megahertz digital channel that broadcasters have requested. Although pressure from broadcaster groups will make it difficult politically to support such an auction, it would be fundamentally unfair for Congress to give such valuable property away while others are forced to compete for their desired spectrum in the open market. In addition, once broadcasters have been given complete operating flexibility, they can use their current six-megahertz allocation to convert to digital television however and whenever they feel it is appropriate. Furthermore, broadcasters and others can borrow against the value of their spectrum to raise funds to purchase any new spectrum they feel is needed to do business. Finally, the auction of this spectrum should not be restricted to any specific type of use, whether it be broadcasting or even more sophisticated digital types of transmission. Congress should make it clear to the FCC that the spectrum being auctioned can be used for whatever purpose buyers desire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 3: Provide incentives for the public sector to release additional spectrum.</b> Most important, Congress must disgorge much more spectrum from the public sector. One way to facilitate this process without demanding full knowledge of what they are doing with their spectrum is to create a simple incentive mechanism that would give agencies holding the spectrum a cut of the auction proceeds. For example, if the Department of Defense knew that it had been warehousing sizable portions of spectrum that it could afford to release, it might do so voluntarily if it knew it would receive, say, 15 to 25 percent of the auction proceeds. Beyond such incentives, Congress may find it necessary to demand that certain blocks of public spectrum be released immediately to the FCC for private auction, just as it was for previous PCS auctions.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are provided equally to all media.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For over six decades, unconstrained spectrum regulation in the name of the "public interest" has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily is in the public interest rarely is truly in the best interests of consumers. The reason is simple: Regulators, not consumers, are making the decision. Congress should scrap this fraudulent public interest paradigm entirely. If, however, lawmakers insist on continuing to rely on public interest FCC oversight, they should define the standard clearly in law. The new definition should focus on three specific criteria:
<p><blockquote><ul>
<li> The maximization of consumer welfare via the broadening of the general scope of individual decision-making within telecommunications markets;
<p>
<li>The utilization of market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever possible; and
<p>
<li> The full protection of First Amendment rights and equal First Amendment treatment of all communications media, whether print or electronic.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This "consumer welfare" standard would serve the interests of all Americans. It would guarantee that the federal bureaucracy is not in a position to manipulate and coerce spectrum holders into doing things they do not wish to. On the other hand, it would ensure that no spectrum holder is able to capture the regulatory apparatus and use it to exclude competitors.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Transfer remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to an independent body. </b>

Once the previous steps have been taken, the need for spectrum oversight by the FCC or the NTIA will be minimized. Because the NTIA soon may be abolished, all spectrum management should be removed from it immediately. Once property rights are established, remaining spectrum responsibilities (enforcement of technical trespass or nuisance violations) could be handled just as effectively by a smaller Spectrum Coordination Council or Board. The Board or Council would sit in the executive branch and be made up of no more than approximately 50 spectrum engineers, economists, and lawyers. The courts would play an important role in the adjudication of spectrum disputes, and private industry groups would be responsible for a large portion of self-regulation, as they are now. Finally, the Board or Council would represent American interests in international meetings or disputes over spectrum allocations so that all remaining authority over such global issues can be transferred from the Department of State.

<h4>CONCLUSION</h4><hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades of federal spectrum ownership and management have met with predictable failure. While virtually all other resources have been left to private owners to manage in America's free enterprise system, spectrum has remained a quasi-socialized resource. The result: Other resources have been deployed and utilized far more efficiently and effectively while spectrum innovation and entrepreneurialism continue to be held captive by federal regulation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spectrum socialism should end -- and must end -- if the United States hopes to remain on the cutting edge of wireless innovation. Policymakers must look beyond their myopic focus on older wireline industries and find new ways to encourage entrepreneurship in the wireless arena. Property rights in spectrum will guarantee such a result, since only by granting spectrum holders full flexibility and ownership in their allocation can policymakers expect to witness such a dramatic transformation. Unleashing the spectrum is the only way to ensure that this transformation is successful and the communications revolution is complete.

<li>    This should not be surprising. "Responsible for the continued provision and improvement of service, [the regulatory commission] comes increasingly and understandably to identify the interest of the public with that of the existing companies on whom it must rely to deliver goods."  Therefore, "When a commission is responsible for the performance of an industry, it is under never completely escapable pressure to protect the health of the companies it regulates, to assure a desirable performance by relying on those monopolistic chosen instruments and its own controls rather than on the unplanned and unplannable forces of competition."  See Alfred E. Kahn, <I>The Economics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions</I> (Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 1971), p. 46.<p>
<li>    Hazlett, "The Rationality of U.S. Regulation of the Broadcast Spectrum," p. 154.<p>
<li>    Quoted in <I>ibid.</I>, pp. 157-158.<p>
<li>    Many decades later, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) assumed responsibility for the management and allocation of all spectrum utilized by the federal government.<p>
<li>    The scarcity rationale was developed primarily through a series of court cases and FCC decisions over the past six decades. Most notably in <I>NBC v. United States</I>, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), <I>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</I>, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), and <I>CBS v. FCC</I>, 453 U.S. 367 (1981), the Supreme Court argued that scarcity made broadcasting a unique business and that this demanded special treatment to guarantee "the public interest" would be served. Yet the courts also noted similar restrictions on the print medium would be an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. See <I>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo</I>, 418 U.S. 241 (1974). Likewise, recent court cases have held that cable television must be accorded more strict First Amendment protections than broadcast, even though cable is also an electronic medium. See <I>Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 567 F. 2d 9 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <I>Midwest Video Corp. v. FCC</I>, (8th Cir. 1978); <I>Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 768 F. 2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1985). These cases all were heard by lower courts, however, as the Supreme Court has refused continually to hear such cases. This is due most likely to the fact that the Court realizes technological innovation continues to obliterate traditional media boundaries, making court decisions based on the scarcity rationale increasingly confusing and unjustifiable.<p>

<li>    This does not mean, however, that broadcasters put up a serious fight to end the public trustee paradigm. In fact, on one hand they speak of its importance to ensure that viable competitors are kept out of their market, while on the other they cite its intrusiveness as an excuse to produce mediocre programming. As Henry Geller, fellow at the Markle Foundation, notes, "A broadcaster loves to be considered a public interest figure. Broadcasters generally want the economic benefits of being a public fiduciary without having to meet the burden of adhering to public interest content regulation."

<li>    While granting property rights may seem like nothing more than a natural extension of providing full flexibility in use, an important difference exists. Full flexibility could be granted to spectrum users while they continue to lease their allocation from the federal government.

Therefore, bureaucratic meddling could remain a serious problem, especially with regard to content regulation.<p>

<h3>FULFILLING THE PROMISE OF NAFTA: A NEW STRATEGY FOR U.S.-MEXICAN RELATIONS</h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere. With both eyes focused firmly on domestic U.S. politics, the Administration has dropped trade expansion from its Latin American policy agenda while adopting a more aggressive stance not only against illegal immigration from Mexico, but against drug trafficking in the Americas.<sup>1</sup>  However, the Administration is not alone in its retreat from free trade. In Congress, some longtime free traders from both parties are also backpedaling from trade expansion and from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Populist proponents of protectionism have tapped into voter anxieties about the health of the U.S. economy and job security by misrepresenting NAFTA as the cause of the Mexican peso crisis, declining manufacturing wages in the U.S., rising illegal immigration from Mexico, and increased drug trafficking.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At one level, the Clinton Administration appears to understand the importance of foreign trade to the U.S. economy. The President's foreign policy team continues to extol the importance of free trade to America's economic interests. For example, Richard Brown, the White House coordinator for the Summit of the Americas, claims that the Administration has not retreated from the goal of completing negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. Brown also insists that the President has not given up on obtaining fast-track negotiating authority to include Chile in NAFTA<sup>2</sup>.  In practice, however, free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton Administration. During the past year, President Clinton has:
<ul><P>
<li>Reneged on his pledge to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996. The delay in Chile's admission to NAFTA has damaged America's credibility and leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<li>Violated key provisions of NAFTA. For example, the Administration postponed indefinitely the implementation of provisions to permit the circulation of Mexican trucks in U.S. border states.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Dropping the ball on trade with Latin America is merely part of a larger problem with the President's Latin American policy. The Clinton Administration has never possessed a coherent vision of America's economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1993, bowing to pressure from American unions and environmental activist groups, the President delayed NAFTA's approval for a year while labor and environmental side agreements were imposed on Mexico and Canada. The Administration's invasion of Haiti in 1994 and secret immigration agreement with Cuba in 1995 likewise were undertaken in response to domestic political pressures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The damage is done. The task for American policymakers now is to correct the current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible. U.S. relations with Mexico must be repaired, NAFTA must be strengthened, and America must regain its dominant role in the process of hemispheric trade liberalization. To achieve these policy goals, the U.S. government should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Comply with NAFTA.</b>The U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA obligations on schedule. By cheating on NAFTA, the Clinton Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future.

<b>THE TRUTH ABOUT NAFTA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994, Mexico has been suffering its worst economic and political crisis in more than a century. The peso's meltdown sank the myth of Mexico as the standard-bearer of economic reform in the Third World. The &quot;200,000 net new jobs&quot; promised by the Clinton Administration have not materialized, and the U.S. is running a trade deficit with Mexico estimated at $15.83 billion for all of 1995.<sup>3</sup>  Instead of a prosperous partner, Mexico has become a financial ward of the U.S. government. As a result, many Americans now believe that NAFTA caused the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nothing could be further from the truth. NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency. A series of political shocks in 1994 caused a sustained run on the peso by nervous Mexican and foreign investors<sup>4</sup>.  But instead of raising domestic interest rates and cutting public spending, the Salinas administration sharply increased public spending and used the country's international reserves to support an overvalued peso. As a result, the peso collapsed. Moreover, it was the devaluation of the peso that crashed the Mexican economy and cheapened the value of Mexican exports. These cheaper Mexican exports account for the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious. Thanks to NAFTA, those who favored returning to a closed, statist economy were kept at bay while President Zedillo was able to keep the country on course to capitalist democracy. NAFTA is still the best guarantee that Mexico will become a true capitalist democracy and prosperous trading partner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and U.S. Competitiveness. </b>NAFTA is the best way to stimulate America's growth and competitiveness. Mexico is America's fastest-growing export market and third largest trading partner, as well as a key factor in the international competitiveness of many U.S. industries that have established manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico since the 1960s. These plants enable U.S. manufacturers to compete against low-wage manufactures from China and other Asian countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate 2.5 times greater than U.S. export growth to the rest of the world<sup>5</sup>.  From 1987 to 1993, 48 of the 50 states expanded their merchandise sales to Latin America and the Caribbean, with Mexico absorbing the largest absolute share each year; 17 states expanded their exports to Mexico and Latin America by more than 200 percent during this period, and 15 recorded export growth of more than 100 percent. The biggest state exporters to Mexico and Latin America are Texas, Florida, California, Michigan, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana<sup>6</sup>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America each year, with Mexico absorbing more than half of the total. These exports represent 19 percent of all U.S. merchandise exports and support nearly 1.96 million U.S. jobs. During the first year of NAFTA's implementation in 1994, U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada climbed rapidly. Merchandise exports to Canada, America's largest trading partner, grew by more than 13 percent to $114 billion, while exports to Mexico increased over 22 percent to $51 billion. U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 8.8 percent during 1995 as a result of the peso crisis but at the end of the year still remained well above the total for 1993, the last year before NAFTA went into effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Production-sharing operations along the U.S.-Mexican border, known as <I>maquiladoras</I>, are an important competitive strategy for many American firms competing in the U.S. domestic market with goods made by low-cost Asian producers. For example, products assembled in Mexico's <I>maquiladora</I> industries from U.S.-made components accounted for 48 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and America's National Security</b>. NAFTA is very important to U.S. national security. Illegal immigration and drug trafficking are perceived increasingly as threats to this security. By a very large majority, Americans want their government to control and reduce illegal immigration and stop the flow of illegal drugs entering the U.S.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the Mexican peso crisis fanned the American public's concern that the U.S. is being overwhelmed by a flood of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 3 million Mexicans enter the U.S. illegally each year.<sup>9</sup>  More than 80 percent of the cocaine brought into America is transported through Mexico by Mexican drug cartels. Mexican police investigators have disclosed that drug traffickers penetrated the highest levels of the Salinas Administration. Drug-related corruption is widespread within the PRI, Mexico's ruling party, especially at the state level. The police, courts, and military also have been corrupted by Mexican drug traffickers whose operations generate profits in excess of $30 billion a year. 
<P>
NAFTA is America's most valuable foreign policy tool in managing these security threats on its southern flank. In addition to accelerating Mexico's transformation into a capitalist democracy, NAFTA is a foundation on which to develop effective cross-border agreements to deal with the twin threats of illegal immigration and drug trafficking in both countries. With NAFTA promoting closer economic ties between the U.S. and Mexico, governments in both countries will face increased pressure from their respective constituencies to work out effective solutions for cross-border problems that hinder trade, economic growth, and competitiveness.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and Democracy in Mexico. </b>NAFTA is an important anchor for reform in Mexico. The closed, one-party system that spurred Mexico's economic development and guaranteed the country's political stability for over six decades is coming apart at the seams. A pluralist democracy is emerging, but the old statist regime will not surrender quickly or quietly. On January 12, 1996, 255 of the 298 representatives of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) publicly called on the government to &quot;abandon neo-liberalism and grant priority to action against poverty and unemployment.&quot;<sup>10</sup>  Similar demands are being made by other groups, including the left-wing PRD, small and medium business, the rebels in Chiapas, consumer debtor organizations, and farmers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these pressures, President Zedillo has stood firm on Mexico's commitment to market-oriented policies, free trade, and compliance with NAFTA. Zedillo's main political priorities are to encourage the growth of a pluralist and open democracy, establish the rule of law, reform Mexico's judicial system, and eradicate widespread police corruption at the national and local level. Without NAFTA, Zedillo's chances of advancing these political reforms would be very poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>NAFTA and a Free Trade Area of the Americas. </B>NAFTA is the foundation upon which the U.S. can negotiate free-trade agreements with other Latin American countries. Latin America is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and the U.S. has been one of the principal beneficiaries of that growth. For over six years, Latin American governments have pursued aggressive policies to liberalize trade. As a result, America's exports to other countries in the Western Hemisphere (including Canada) have increased over 50 percent since 1990, growing from $137 billion to nearly $207 billion in 1994 and creating 1.4 million new jobs for American workers. Overall, two-way trade between the U.S. and the Western Hemisphere jumped over 44 percent between 1990 and 1994, from $292.8 billion to $423 billion. U.S. exports to Latin America accounted for one-fifth of total U.S. exports during 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, for free trade between the U.S. and Latin America to continue growing, NAFTA must be expanded quickly to other countries in the Western Hemisphere, starting with Chile and Argentina. It also should be expanded to include countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore that want to liberalize trade faster than currently envisioned by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NAFTA is the linchpin of U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.<sup>11</sup>  It assumes that the best way to achieve both sustained economic development and stable democracy is to expand international trade. The emerging capitalist democracies of Latin America and the Caribbean have embraced free trade and NAFTA without reservations, providing the U.S. an unparalleled foreign policy tool for the expansion of free trade, the consolidation of democracy, and the reaffirmation of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere. NAFTA is also the benchmark trade agreement for the creation by 2005 of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). As long as NAFTA's expansion remains stalled, the U.S. has no effective Latin America policy.
<P>

<b>MEXICO HAS NOT TURNED THE CORNER</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration claims that the worst of the Mexican crisis has passed. Mexico's external accounts are once again in balance, exports soared in 1995, the peso has risen, inflation is slowing, and interest rates have eased from their peak levels of 80 percent to 100 percent in early 1995. Moreover, Mexico has raised over $6 billion from international capital markets since the peso collapsed, and the Zedillo government is meeting the deadlines for repaying the money it owes to the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). <sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, the Clinton Administration's claim that Mexico has &quot;turned the corner&quot;<sup>13</sup> is premature. The Mexican economy contracted between 6 percent and 8 percent during 1995.<sup>14</sup>  Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz admits that 1995 was the worst year for Mexico since the revolution<sup>15</sup>, although he also projects that the Mexican economy will grow 3 percent in 1996. Yet most private analysts forecast slower growth, more devaluation, and higher inflation because Mexico's banking system is still very weak. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican government already has spent $6.5 billion to bail out the banking system and may have to spend another $10.9 billion during 1996 to keep the system afloat.  In all, the cost of bailing out Mexico's banking system could add up to $20 billion, or more than 12 percent of Mexico's GNP for 1995. Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment bank, estimates that 30 percent of the Mexican banking system's debts are non-performing.<sup>17</sup>  Moreover, the system's problems may be worse than they appear to be, because Mexican banks book only the interest on past-due loans and not the entire loan, including the principal, as U.S. banks are required to list in their accounting.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another problem for the Mexican economy is the political weakness of President Zedillo. Two national polls conducted in November 1995<sup>19</sup> found that three-quarters of Mexico's voters approve of Zedillo's honesty and commitment to democracy but they give him poor marks on political leadership and ability to manage the economy. Two-thirds of the respondents in both polls disapproved of how Zedillo was governing the country, and over 80 percent said that he should change his cabinet. More than half of those surveyed felt the first two ministries to be changed should be the Finance Ministry and the Trade and Industrial Development Ministry. Compared to a similar poll conducted three months earlier,<sup>20</sup> the November poll indicated less confidence in Zedillo and increasing discontent with how he is managing Mexico's difficulties.
<p>
<b>A MEXICAN FREE-MARKET SOLUTION</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's $50 billion bailout has not halted Mexico's downward spiral of devaluation, depression, and eventual default. Clinton ignored the principles of free trade when he went to the aid of the Mexican government. The main beneficiaries were Wall Street speculators and Mexican banks and companies owned by business leaders close to the Salinas regime and the ruling PRI. Moreover, the Administration's decision to bail out Mexico with $20 billion from the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund effectively underwrote the cost of refinancing the Mexican government's entire short-term debt without a U.S. congressional appropriation. Clinton's failed attempt to rescue Mexico also created a moral hazard: It signaled foreign governments and private investors that mistakes caused by political incompetence and corruption will be underwritten by American taxpayers through the U.S. Treasury, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of correcting the structural causes of the Mexican peso crisis, President Zedillo is repeating the errors of the Salinas administration. The policies of Finance Minister Ortiz are indistinguishable from those pursued by Pedro Aspe, his predecessor during the Salinas government. Pressured by the U.S. Treasury and the IMF, the Zedillo administration is following policies which are destroying Mexico's economy. The Zedillo government is doing everything it can to maintain the Wall Street fiction that Mexico is an investment-grade economy. At bottom, Zedillo's economic policies are intended to keep Mexico safe for portfolio investment, not to promote the sustained export growth that constitutes the only escape route from Mexico's current economic crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The central problem is that Mexico's financial technocrats refuse to consider a fixed exchange rate policy to achieve price stability. Since the peso's collapse, Mexico's central bank has implemented a floating exchange rate regime that allows the country's monetary authorities broad discretionary power to manipulate monetary and currency exchange policies. The problem with this policy is that Mexico's central bank lacks the credibility and international reserves to sustain itself without continued loans from the U.S. government and the IMF.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To achieve price stability under its current floating exchange rate, the Bank of Mexico will have to impose a relatively tight monetary policy and high interest rates. Inevitably, this will be accompanied by very slow economic growth. A sluggish Mexican economy would depress export earnings and foreign investment, making it more difficult for the government to service its foreign debt obligations. Slow economic growth also would fuel increased political turmoil, a revival of statist economic prescriptions, and more illegal migration to the U.S. This could weaken support for NAFTA in both countries and increase cross-border tensions over sensitive issues like drug trafficking and illegal immigration. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Only Mexico can devise lasting solutions for the Mexican crisis. NAFTA is vitally important to Mexico's future economic prosperity and democratic stability, but it is only part of the equation. Mexico has yet to go the full distance to capitalist democracy. Moreover, it has yet to devise an effective economic model capable of delivering the sort of sustained growth Chile has managed to achieve since 1985. Natural resources, human capital, and access to technology are not the problems. Mexico has all three in abundance. Missing, however, is the bold, imaginative leadership capable of conceiving and executing a strategy to complete Mexico's transition to capitalist democracy. Ideally, such a strategy would involve five goals:
<p>
<b>1.) Restore confidence in Mexico by stabilizing the currency. </b>This requires replacing the Bank of Mexico with a currency board.<sup>21</sup>  To achieve sustained export growth and price stability, Mexico needs a sound monetary system, which a currency board would provide. The Bank of Mexico's floating exchange rate may be the favored option of Mexico's financial authorities, but it is fundamentally unsound because it allows arbitrary, discretionary control over Mexico's monetary and exchange problems. The principal goals of a currency board would be to fix the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar and to eliminate the broad discretionary power (and lack of accountability) of Mexico's financial authorities to manipulate monetary and exchange policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The establishment of a currency board would stabilize the peso virtually overnight and restore confidence in Mexico. It would do so by instituting a non-discretionary, rules-bound, and totally transparent currency exchange regime. A currency board would prohibit public spending above levels that threaten reserves, stimulate more foreign direct investment, and insulate the peso from political interference and bureaucratic tinkering, in addition to quickly reducing inflation and interest rates, thereby spurring an increase in real long-term productive investment in Mexico.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More than 70 countries have used currency boards. In all cases, these boards have produced stable currencies that keep inflation at substantially low levels. No currency board has ever devalued its local money against its reserve currency. Argentina has been using a variant of the currency board since 1991. In every country where a currency board has been established, governments have succeeded in killing the deadly virus of high inflation, lowering local interest rates to manageable levels, and encouraging direct foreign investment in the local economy. The creation of a currency board in Mexico would be the first step in a Mexican free-market solution for the Mexican crisis.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
<b>2.) Break Mexico's addiction to foreign debt. </b>This means restructuring Mexico's banking sector. Standard &amp; Poor's estimates that the bailout of Mexico's private banks will cost the equivalent of 12 percent of the country's 1995 GNP.<sup>23</sup>  Debt relief programs created by the Zedillo administration will not work under the current floating exchange rate because higher inflation from the ongoing devaluation of the peso caused by the banking crisis, along with the continuing need to cheapen Mexico's exports, will cause Mexico's domestic debts to increase more rapidly than the ability of debtors to repay them. Moreover, Mexico cannot increase its borrowings from the IMF because it already has exceeded, by a factor of nearly 20, its allowable credit ceiling under existing IMF rules. Complicating matters even more, in November 1995 the Clinton Administration rejected a formal Mexican request for more financial assistance to bail out the banking system.<sup>24</sup>  As a result, the Zedillo government may be tempted to print more pesos to rescue the banks, driving up inflation and keeping interest rates at high levels. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A currency board would create the stable price environment that Mexican banks need to recapitalize and restructure their domestic credit portfolios. Bad debts could be winnowed out of bank portfolios and written off. Collectable consumer and corporate debt could be restructured and securitized,<sup>25</sup> creating a secondary market where domestic debt paper could be traded at a discount. However, the government also should lift all remaining limits on ownership of banks and other commercial enterprises.<sup>26</sup>
<p>
<B>3.) Promote sustained economic growth. </B>A key to achieving this goal is liberalizing Mexico's national oil industry.<sup>27</sup>  The Mexican government owns 100 percent of the country's oil and natural gas industry. On February 12, 1996, the Mexican government announced its new energy program for the next five years. The plan is a restatement of Mexico's traditionally anti-market, monopolistic approach to energy development. <sup>28</sup> Jesus Reyes Heroles, president of the state oil monopoly <I>Petroleos Mexicanos</I> (Pemex), predicts that Mexico will attract $6.3 billion in foreign investment in petrochemicals, power plants, and natural gas companies. However, declared Reyes Heroles, no private investment will be permitted in upstream exploration, production, and refining of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Mexico, a better alternative would be to follow the example of more efficient and successful state-owned oil companies. A good model is <I>Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA),</I> which is implementing a mixed-economy expansion program to develop the country's oil and gas reserves.<sup>29</sup>  Without giving up ownership of Mexico's oil and gas reserves, Pemex could contract with small private operators to exploit older and smaller oil and gas reservoirs that are uneconomic for Pemex to operate commercially. In addition, Pemex could enter into long-term associations with large international oil companies to find and develop major oil and gas reservoirs which Pemex is not financially or technologically capable of exploiting by itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As oil and gas export earnings increase, part of the incremental profits could be reinvested in the expansion and modernization of Mexico's oil industry, and part could be deposited directly to the accounts of Mexican workers in privately managed pension funds. Such a strategy would represent a true &quot;nationalization&quot; of the Mexican oil industry, since it would transfer real oil wealth directly to workers and their families, creating a fast-growth domestic savings industry to finance Mexico's economic development with internal savings rather than with crippling external debt. 
<p>
<b>4.) Increase disposable income. </b>Mexico's income tax rate should be cut and income thresholds increased. The top tax rate of 35 percent takes hold at very low levels of income. To spur investment, Mexico should extend its current zero percent capital gains tax rate on large stock exchange companies to all investments.<sup>30</sup>

<p>
<b>5.) Create better legal and political institutions for economic growth. </b>This requires both judicial and political reform. The rule of law and transparent democratic institutions are essential for the well-being and prosperity of successful capitalist democracies. President Zedillo has pledged massive overhaul of the judicial and political systems in Mexico, but efforts on both fronts are not progressing quickly, largely because of increased political discontent and resistance to change fueled by the current economic depression.
<p>
<b>REASSERTING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America is dangerous. The Clinton Administration is projecting an image of retreat. In Mexico, still struggling to overcome its economic difficulties and recover its political stability, there is widespread concern about the depth of Washington's commitment to NAFTA. Throughout Latin America, political leaders trying to promote unpopular free-market reforms are questioning the sincerity of the Clinton Administration's pledge that the U.S. would lead the process of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas. The longer America's policy drift continues, the greater the risk that hard-won economic and democratic reforms will be stalled or even rolled back in some countries. Moreover, if Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide. To regain the initiative in Latin America, the U.S. government should: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Comply with NAFTA. </b> The Clinton Administration should respect NAFTA's provisions and timetables for implementation. By cheating on NAFTA, the Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future. Permits for Mexican trucks to circulate in the U.S. border states should be issued without further delay if the vehicles comply with all technical, safety, and legal requirements as stipulated in NAFTA.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Complete the NAFTA with Mexico.</B>The peso crisis demonstrated the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and Mexican economies. It also showed that NAFTA is an incomplete pact. Some of NAFTA's most important provisions have yet to be negotiated by the U.S. and Mexico, including currency unification, forgiveness of the Mexican government's public-sector debt, illegal immigration, and labor and law enforcement problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and other countries. </B>Since the end of the Cold War, free trade and support for democracy have been the pillars of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. The Clinton Administration's retreat from NAFTA's expansion has left the U.S. without a coherent foreign policy for Latin America and sidelined from the ongoing process of trade liberalization in South America. Thus, NAFTA should be expanded to include Chile, and later to include Asian countries that qualify.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chile is a beacon of economic prosperity and democracy for all of Latin America. It has set the standard for success in the region by achieving average growth rates of 6 percent annually every year since 1985, along with inflation of less than 8 percent, unemployment of 5 percent, and savings and domestic investment of 27 percent of GDP. Postponing Chile's admission to NAFTA would slow hemispheric trade integration and weaken American leadership.<sup>31</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Asian countries also should be considered for NAFTA membership. Some members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, are willing to liberalize trade at a much faster pace than is currently envisioned by APEC and may wish to negotiate free trade agreements with the U.S. as quickly as possible. Instead of a series of separate bilateral pacts, incorporating Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore into NAFTA would make sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board. </b>The current Mexican experiment with a floating exchange rate will fail eventually.<sup>32</sup>  The U.S. should encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board that would fix the peso's exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. The creation of a currency board would stabilize the peso, reduce inflation and interest rates, and restore confidence in Mexico and NAFTA. Under a currency board, if a run on the peso occurred, the worst that could happen would be the total dollarization of Mexico, since trading would take place in U.S. dollars while the currency board held the stock of Mexican pesos.<sup>33</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico's public sector foreign debt. </B>This offer should be extended in return for an irrevocable pledge by Mexico to end all future international borrowing by government entities, not to take any more money from the IMF and World Bank, and to rely only on private investment to drive Mexico's economic development. There is no moral hazard in forgiving Mexico's entire public sector foreign debt, since it will never be repaid in full anyway. Moreover, writing off the public-sector's foreign debt would free Mexico from the IMF's destructive clutches.<sup>34</sup>  The IMF's record in Mexico, an IMF borrower since 1976, has been impoverishment, indebtedness, and dependency.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking. </B>For many years, America's war on drugs in the Western Hemisphere has concentrated on the Andean drug trade, with special emphasis on Colombia, while largely ignoring the closer threat of Mexican drug traffickers. However, since the mid-1980s, 19 distinct drug cartels have emerged in Mexico.<sup>36</sup>  President Salinas himself admitted that the annual flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs through Mexico totals some $100 billion annually. The rise of these drug cartels threatens the national security of both Mexico and the United States. The U.S. and Mexico should begin talks to enhance cooperation in apprehending and prosecuting illegal drug traffickers.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican peso crisis weakened support in America for NAFTA, damaged U.S.-Mexico relations, and halted further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Americas for at least the next two years. Moreover, the crisis in Mexico is not over yet: Clinton's $50 billion bailout of the Zedillo government kept Mexico from defaulting on its foreign debt obligations in 1995, but Mexico's downward economic spiral was not reversed. The economic policies of the Zedillo government will not achieve the structural reforms that Mexico needs to avoid another currency collapse. The market's recent surge of optimism in Mexico's recovery therefore may prove to be very short-lived.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the Mexican crisis continues, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow. Conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking easily could displace cooperation on trade and investment. More crisis in Mexico also will fuel opposition in both countries to NAFTA and free trade, possibly delaying NAFTA's implementation in North America and derailing its expansion to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>The Economist</I> argues that NAFTA is one of the principal factors responsible for &quot;a second Mexican revolution,&quot;<sup>37</sup> and asserts that Mexico's successful transformation into a stable capitalist democracy depends on its becoming &quot;more like America.&quot;<sup>38</sup>  More than that of any other country in Latin America, Mexico's future is tied, for better or worse, to the future of the United States. However, the American goal of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), based on NAFTA's expansion to all democratic countries in the Western Hemisphere, depends on the quick return of economic and political stability to Mexico. As long as the crisis continues in Mexico, it will be difficult for any U.S. Administration to rebuild bipartisan congressional support for NAFTA's expansion and regain public trust and support for free trade. The U.S. needs to work with Mexico, through NAFTA, to help end this economic crisis.

<li>&nbsp;During his State of the Union address to Congress on January 25, 1996, President Clinton announced the appointment of Army General Barry McCaffrey to head the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Although McCaffrey's appointment did not cause any reaction in the U.S., throughout Latin America it was widely seen as a sign that the Clinton Administration plans to militarize the hemispheric war on drugs. Another first was the Administration's decision to deploy local law enforcement officers alongside federal agents already patrolling the U.S. border with Mexico, and to increase the use of armed forces personnel as support for the U.S. Border Patrol.

<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reagan Administration understood that support for democracy and the hemispheric expansion of free trade was the foundation of future U.S. relations with Latin America. During the two Reagan Administrations, the Caribbean Basin Initiative was launched, and the groundwork was laid for a new relationship between the U.S. and Mexico based on the expansion of bilateral trade and investment, closer economic interdependence, and progressive economic liberalization in Mexico. In 1988, the U.S. and Canada signed a Free Trade Agreement that later would serve as the foundation for NAFTA. The Bush Administration's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, launched in 1989, outlined a blueprint for creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA); the first step in achieving the goal of a hemispheric FTAA was the negotiation of the NAFTA with Mexico. When the Clinton Administration was inaugurated in 1993, the NAFTA talks between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada already had been completed. Clinton delayed NAFTA's implementation until 1994 while unnecessary labor and environmental side agreements were negotiated with Mexico and Canada. Moreover, at the Summit of the Americas, Clinton reaffirmed long&#173;standing U.S. policy that NAFTA should be the standard for creating a hemispheric FTAA.
<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 29, 1996, the Mexican government repaid the U.S. Treasury $1.3 billion in short&#173;term swaps issued under the U.S.&#173;Mexico Framework Agreement announced by the Clinton Administration on February 21, 1995. In all, $13.5 billion in U.S. funds was disbursed to Mexico from the ESF, of which $10.5 billion in medium&#173;term swaps remains outstanding. The ESF, created by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, has been used since the 1973 demise of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime to intervene in foreign exchange markets and finance short&#173;term loans to developed and developing countries. As of early 1995, the ESF held about $25 billion. The ESF is not financed with regular appropriations from Congress, so it &quot;borrows&quot; from the Federal Reserve when it needs additional funds. These loans are &quot;warehoused&quot; at the Federal Reserve, where the Treasury stores its foreign currencies in exchange for dollars that must be repaid later.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the congressional budget process is notorious for missed deadlines, this fiscal year's effort to craft a budget for the federal government has set records for delay. At a time when both Congress and the President should be well along in developing a budget for FY 1997, they have yet to agree on spending for FY 1996. Nearly halfway through the current fiscal year, in other words, Congress and the White House must try to complete two budgets in a time frame that has proved inadequate for one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last year, the congressional budget process, with its complicated procedures, proved to be woefully ineffective in securing enactment of the ambitious agenda of the 104th Congress. But it did prove to be a highly effective weapon in the hands of a President determined to protect the status quo. Observers and participants concede a first-round victory to President Clinton, who has attempted to postpone the second round by arguing, along with some of his allies in Congress, that a national debate on last year's budget issues should be deferred until the upcoming presidential campaign, which should serve as a referendum on Congress's agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should ignore this suggestion that it relinquish its constitutionally mandated fiscal responsibilities. Instead, it should rejoin the budget struggle with a strategy that takes advantage of the impressive legislative accomplishments of the first session and the original intentions of the congressional budget process. This means focusing more intensely on timely completion of the appropriations and authorization process, and any necessary enabling legislation, as the primary mechanisms for crafting and enacting the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By doing this, Congress could divide its far-reaching agenda into functional components, debating each issue on its individual merits rather than as part of a larger package in which important reform issues are lost in controversy over out-year deficit targets. This approach also would allow Members to separate components of the budget that are controversial from those that are not, thereby limiting the President's ability to hold government hostage to his own political agenda. In addition, recognizing that Congress must complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets in a very limited period of time, Congress should adopt a biennial budget that embodies the key reforms developed during the last session. 

<p>
<b>A SIX-POINT PLAN FOR BUDGET VICTORY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following six point strategy would allow Congress both to adopt two-year budgets and to enact its reform agenda in the limited time available.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) </b>Adopt a biennial budget strategy during this session. This would allow Congress to complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets, meet dual spending targets in those authorization and appropriation bills either vetoed or not yet signed by the President, and pass the legislation needed to change entitlements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2.)</b> Place greater reliance on individual authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation, completed on schedule, as the primary vehicles for fiscal and legislative reform. This contrasts with the current strategy of depending on continuing resolutions or omnibus reconciliation bills. By constructing a budget using authorization and appropriation bills, and if necessary segmenting the 13 individual appropriations bills into an even greater number of functional accounts, Congress would focus the debate more sharply on the profound policy differences involved and prevent the President from using these disagreements to block reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3.)</b> Build upon last year's considerable legislative accomplishments in such areas as welfare, Medicare and Medicaid reform, and discretionary programs. Last year, Congress enacted major reforms in several policy areas to improve the operation of federal programs. When folded together in giant budget bills, these accomplishments were blocked by President Clinton. These same bills should be split into separate bills. Along with existing but unsigned appropriations bills and related legislation, they should be amended to extend spending authority and program changes over a second year and sent separately to the President.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4.)</b> Use the breathing room available under this budget strategy to remedy deficiencies in budget-related House and Senate bills either now being considered or already passed but not signed into law. Congress should use the current impasse as a second chance to reconsider its performance in such areas as transportation, housing, privatization, and devolution -- areas in which last year's authorization and appropriation bills often fell short of promised reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5.)</b> Lawmakers must keep focusing on why they were elected -- to cut the budget and reform government. Talk of "CBO scoring" for "front-loaded glide paths," "growth from baseline," and "reconciliation" is the language of staff, not leadership. Americans want the budget cut because they know their hard-earned money is financing waste, redundancy, and obsolescence.  Lawmakers must take every opportunity to explain their programs and accomplishments in the same vivid terms that convinced voters to entrust them with the job.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6.)</b> Adopt an appropriate division of labor within the leadership. This is needed to ensure that individual committee work products are timely and conform to overall congressional objectives. It is needed also to make sure that leadership is not so thinly spread over every issue. 
<p>
<b>The Need to be Better Prepared</b>
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Heady with success from passing key elements in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyic.com:80/conservative/contract.html">Contract With America</a> and adopting a balanced budget while fundamentally reforming welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare, Congress was caught unprepared by the President's veto strategy to defend the status quo. Congress relied too heavily on an omnibus reconciliation process and on comprehensive continuing resolutions as substitutes for a set of separate authorization and appropriations bills. Congress presented the President with an all-or nothing package covering so many significant issues that it was devoid of meaningful policy content. The President accepted the challenge by holding the government hostage, thereby allowing the news media to reduce the debate to sound-bite-friendly statements about Yellowstone sleigh rides and tickets to the Statue of Liberty. Lost was any serious discussion of the need to restore the viability of Medicare, reform the destructive welfare system, and boost the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The three-time failure to achieve success with the all-or-nothing strategy has left many in Congress demoralized and confused, with lawmakers assuming they can achieve little this year. But this need not be the case. A different approach to budget process could allow Congress to turn its impressive collection of legislative initiatives last year into law this year.
<p>
<b>Building on Last Year's Accomplishments</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The key to restarting the process is to recognize that the first session of the 104th Congress was remarkably successful in passing legislation that would fundamentally reform many of the government's most troubled programs. After decades of empty promises, it was this Congress that finally confronted the welfare and Medicaid mess, passed the necessary legislative remedies, and sent them to the President. Similarly, the financially collapsing Medicare program was overhauled to give seniors far more choices than any previous Congress or President had even considered. These reforms did not become law. The only reason: because President Clinton refused to sign them. Likewise, in many of the discretionary accounts, scores of wasteful and obsolete programs were terminated or cut back substantially, and some of these terminations were signed into law by the President.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This agenda should be pursued aggressively during the second session of the 104th Congress in a debate which sets out clearly the choices that must be made -- a focus lacking during the latter part of 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To do this, Congress should move immediately to construct a biennial budget resolution for the combined 1996 and 1997 fiscal years, using last year's resolution as the base and including whatever corrections might be needed to reflect spending, taxing, and economic patterns already underway. With this accomplished, Congress should move swiftly to complete the drafting (mostly by refining earlier bills) and passage of the authorization and appropriation bills and other legislation needed to turn the hundreds of decisions embodied in the budget resolution into law. Most of these authorization and appropriations bills, like the budget resolution, should cover at least two years.
<P>
<b>Speed Up the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should stop using omnibus reconciliation bills and continuing resolutions as its primary vehicles in advancing fiscal and policy objectives. Instead, as intended by the Budget Act, it should rely on the timely completion of authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation to implement spending decisions contained in the budget resolution. Under the Budget Act (as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990), the House Appropriations Committee must report out all of its bills by June 10, and the House must complete action on them by June 30. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Last year, however, the House passed only two of 13 appropriations bills by the June 30 deadline. Eight more were passed in July, and the remainder in August and September. Similar delays occurred in the Senate, and the first appropriations bill was not sent to the President until eight days before the start of the new fiscal year. By the time the new fiscal year had begun, only two appropriations bills had been cleared for the President's signature. Legislation to reform major entitlements also was not completed until after the fiscal year began.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When passage of spending bills is delayed until after the start of the fiscal year, the need to avoid a government shutdown forces Congress to rely on a single omnibus reconciliation bill or comprehensive continuing resolution to enact its agenda. This, in turn, allows the President to hold the entire government hostage to his own plans and avoid an open debate on the issues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the recent past, the reconciliation process and related legislation often were used as a substitute for the appropriations process, partly because it is easier to deal with a single omnibus bill than with 13 or more separate pieces of legislation. While this approach may work when Congress and the President are in general agreement on key issues, however, the process tends to exacerbate differences when they are not. Reliance on premature reconciliation bills also is a factor in keeping Congress from completing action on appropriations bills in advance of the relevant fiscal year, forcing it to pass continuing resolutions or some other form of omnibus legislation to keep government open while budgets await approval. Indeed, persistent delay in getting these bills completed before the start of the fiscal year was one of the many reasons Congress passed the Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974.
<P>
<b>Rely on the Appropriations and Authorization Process, As Improved and Intended</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By avoiding omnibus reconciliation bills and ambitious continuing resolutions, Congress places the burden of fiscal responsibility where it was intended to be placed and where it resided for nearly two centuries before enactment of the 1974 Budget Act:<sup>2</sup>  on the authorization and appropriations process. By relying on the timely completion of appropriations bills and necessary legislation within the schedule mandated by the Budget Act and avoiding dependence on a single bill to effect substantive policy and fiscal changes, Congress would follow more closely the original intent of the Act.3  But, as noted above, such bills seldom have been completed and signed into law by the start of the fiscal year. With just a month to go before reaching the mid-point of FY 1996, only eight of the 13 bills have been signed by the President, and the one covering the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services has not even been completed, thanks to a threatened Senate filibuster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House and Senate leadership promise that this year's appropriation committee performance will be swift and timely. Such promises have been made at the start of every session in living memory, but with little result. This year, they actually could mean something. Paradoxically, one reason for optimism is that with so few of last year's appropriations bills and related legislation signed into law, subcommittees of the appropriations and authorizing committees need only rewrite and edit the bills that already have been completed, adding an additional year of spending so that they cover two years instead of just one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To accelerate the process, out-year spending projections in the FY 1996 budget resolution could serve as a preliminary basis for the FY 1997 portions of the appropriations bills until the new FY 1996/FY 1997 budget resolution is passed on or before the April 15 deadline. This process also would include all of the authorization bills and companion legislation needed to accomplish fundamental reform of the entitlement programs. The bills covering Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform are just as necessary and as valid today as they were last year when rejected by the President as parts of a single omnibus bill or as separate pieces of legislation. They should be separated into individual bills, then modified as appropriate and resubmitted to the President in a process designed to draw clear distinctions between Congress's reforms and the President's embrace of the status quo.
<p>
<b>Conduct a National Debate on Separate Issues</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The main advantage of swiftly following the budget resolution with separate authorization and appropriations bills and legislation to alter entitlements is that Congress and the President then could conduct a clear debate in each policy area. When everything is lumped into a reconciliation bill or continuing resolution, issues of fundamental change, and the reasons for them, get lost in an angry debate over lines on a chart and out-year deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By separating the budget into 13 or more appropriations bills and any number of other bills needed to reform program operations, Congress can engage the President directly in a debate over differences in policy on a program-by-program basis and challenge the President more effectively in his defense of the status quo. Instead of creating an environment where the President can talk about hungry children while rejecting a reform of Medicare, separating bills into their functional components would permit Congress to compare what it wants to achieve through welfare reform with existing inner-city squalor in federally funded public housing projects. Further, separating bills in this way would allow lawmakers to talk about the reforms themselves, rather than about back-loaded baselines and seven-year CBO projections. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 This strategy would allow lawmakers to draw vivid and clear distinctions between abuses that exist and the reforms they know the nation both wants and needs. The successful strategy used in the House last January to pass comprehensive regulatory reform can serve as a model to involve the public in a debate that otherwise might become obtuse and technical. Medicare, Medicaid, federal job training programs, deplorable conditions in public housing projects, and obsolete agencies are just some of the costly targets of opportunity that should be brought to the attention of a public still eager for reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 In implementing this strategy, there is no reason why Congress has to limit itself to its traditional 13 appropriations bills. Without challenging any committee's current jurisdiction, appropriations bills could be subdivided more finely into functional areas that lead to clearer debates on policy differences, at the same time denying the President and a minority in Congress the opportunity to hold one program hostage to another. For example, the National Park Service, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, and any other programs likely to trigger intense debate could be brought forward as separate bills rather than as subsections of a single "Department of Interior and Related Agencies" bill. Likewise, the single appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, and State could be sliced easily into three or more components, while separate bills covering each of the major entitlement reform initiatives could be brought forward and debated on their merits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Added to this agenda should be similarly comprehensive reform legislation for areas of government which last year were not subject to nearly the degree of reform that many of the social welfare programs and independent agencies experienced, leaving the majority in Congress vulnerable to charges, for example, of ignoring costly "corporate welfare" programs. Only limited changes were imposed on the troubled public housing industry or on the transportation, public power, and agriculture interests, to name just a few. These costly deficiencies should be remedied during the second session and within the combined FY 1996/FY 1997 resolution and related authorization/appropriations process.
<p>
<b>Managing the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By promising to complete the appropriations/authorization process in a timely fashion, Congress has set for itself an ambitious goal -- one it has failed to fulfill during much of the recent past, including the last session of Congress when so much was at stake. Is Congress up to the task of performing this well?  It may be able to do so, but only if changes also are made in the management of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Specifically, the House and Senate leadership should stick with issues more appropriate to leaders and leave the complicated technical details to others. By defining duties and responsibilities more clearly, the leadership could take full advantage of the efficiencies that arise from an effective division of labor by organizing members into issue teams, drawn from the relevant committees, and assigning to these teams the responsibility of advancing each of the key policies. These teams would focus on such cross-cutting issues as welfare reform or the termination of wasteful programs, championing them in debate on behalf of the majority. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, because it has yet to complete its work on many of the appropriations bills and most of the entitlement reforms for the FY 1996 budget, Congress also will need to produce and defend a series of interim continuing resolutions to keep government operating, at the same time advancing whatever incremental reforms can be brought along for the ride. Perhaps another task force, drawn from the leadership and the budget, tax, and appropriations committees, could be formed to fulfill this duty while the leadership and key committee chairmen develop and implement a comprehensive biennial budget with promised reforms.

<title>Key Changes Needed In the Governors' Medicaid Proposal - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>KEY CHANGES NEEDED IN THE GOVERNORS' MEDICAID PROPOSAL</h3>

John C. Liu<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 89<br>
March 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The congressional leadership is drafting comprehensive Medicaid reform legislation based on a recent outline proposal endorsed unanimously by the National Governors Association (NGA). But unless the legislation differs sharply from the governors' outline in some critical details, it will be a disaster rather than a reform, preserving some of the worst features of today's Medicaid program while opening the door to another state-led raid on the U.S. Treasury. To avoid this, the legislation must make two crucial changes in the governors' plan: It must limit the categories of Americans guaranteed benefits and, even more important, must not include an open-ended state entitlement to "umbrella" funds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The outline preamble calls explicitly for an end to the entitlement status of Medicaid and for the establishment of a block grant system of financing. But a close reading of the fine print in the governors' plan shows that the reverse is true. The plan actually sets out a federally defined list of guaranteed benefits for a large "guaranteed population" that would have an entitlement to these benefits. Moreover, the plan does not simply transform Medicaid into a block grant program, with a specific determination of the maximum amount of federal funds each state will receive (at a higher percentage than is typical today); that capitated amount will be only part of the funds flowing to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The plan also contains an "umbrella insurance" provision to provide guaranteed additional money to states in the event of unanticipated growth in the eligible population. It states explicitly that "[t]hese funds are an entitlement to states and are not subject to annual appropriations" by Congress. Thus, state officials, who have shown themselves adept in the past at squeezing huge amounts of federal money out of the fine print of federal Medicaid law, would have unencumbered power to raid the federal treasury. Even the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which strongly opposes devolution of control to the states, warns that the umbrella mechanism "may create incentives for states to 'game' the system and consequently may result in substantial, unintended federal cost."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Keeping the Status Quo.</b> As drafted, the governors' outline retains a comprehensive list of government benefits for Medicaid's "guaranteed" populations.<sup>2</sup>  The groups eligible for this entitlement include: 
<p><ul>
<li> Pregnant women, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children to age 6, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children ages 6 through 12, to 100 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Elderly who meet Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and resource standards; and
<p>
<li> Persons with disabilities as defined by the state in their state plan. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of the 33.4 million Medicaid recipients in 1993, pregnant women and children living on income up to 133 percent of the government's official poverty level accounted for 71 percent, or 23.7 million, of the eligible population. Generally, these recipients also get cash assistance under other major welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supple- mental Security Income (SSI). By mandating states to continue coverage for these individuals, as well as those falling into the two other major categories (elderly and disabled), the governors simply retain the mandatory entitlement features of Medicaid for the vast majority of existing beneficiaries -- features that have contributed to the explosive financial pressures on the Medicaid system. Given the uncapped status of the insurance umbrella, the governors' plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and costly entitlement feature of Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In maintaining a federal definition of which individuals will be guaranteed benefits, the governors seem also to have tied their own hands in reforming their own welfare programs. Since most welfare recipients are categorically entitled to Medicaid benefits, there would remain little incentive for individuals to seek employment with generally more limited insurance through the private sector. Worse, the governors will have neither true flexibility in administering Medicaid nor the ultimate authority in determining how best to provide quality care for their resident poor. It is to help meet the anticipated costs of maintaining federal eligibility and benefits requirements that the governors included an insurance umbrella provision, which will help them shift costs back to the federal taxpayers. That also is the flaw from the federal taxpayer's point of view.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Deficit Dangers.</b> The governors know that the current level of spending growth in Medicaid is unsustainable. While few consider the governors' proposal a step toward fiscal responsibility, the insurance umbrella described in their outline almost certainly would add to the federal deficit. The purpose of the umbrella is understandable: to protect individual states from unanticpated costs due to changes in the growth of their eligible populations. But it is crafted as an uncapped, open-ended entitlement "reserve" fund upon which the states can draw in emergencies, and the outline contains no measures to control federal spending once the provision is triggered. This directly contradicts both the principle and goal of a federal block grant program, and it would allow creative accountants in state government free rein to manipulate eligibility requirements and service levels to shift as much of their costs as possible to categories of people who would qualify for umbrella funds. Past experience with Medicaid shows that they would do so.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rules and Mandates.</b> The nation's governors rightly criticize the red tape of Medicaid mandates with which states must comply in order to get federal matching funds. Moreover, these congressionally imposed requirements hamper state governments' ability to design and implement cost-efficient programs that target medically needy persons. Ironically, the governors' proposal still includes federally defined mandates; even though states would be given much more flexibility, these federally mandated eligibility and benefit requirements would supersede their own authority to decide how best to care for their poor residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The costs associated with federal mandates have not gone unnoticed by this Congress, which has sought to tackle the growing financial burden of an unreformed Medicaid program (an effort vetoed by President Clinton). While the overall cost of the program is rising rapidly, the federal share alone is projected to reach approximately $100 billion in FY 1996. Similarly, states are dedicating a growing percentage of their budgets to providing their residents access to health services. According to an analysis prepared for The Heritage Foundation, if no reforms in the Medicaid program are enacted, the states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money between 1995 and 2002 just to maintain the system as it is today.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW TO FIX THE GOVERNORS' PLAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the governors' proposal calls for much-needed flexibility and a long-overdue block grant approach to financing Medicaid, the NGA's plan itself would not pare back the entitlement feature of Medicaid sufficiently, and the umbrella feature, as currently designed, almost certainly would lead to an uncontrolled hemorrhaging of federal funds. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the governors' plan is to be turned into legislation that actually reforms Medicaid and introduces sensible spending control at the federal level, two crucial changes are necessary. Without them, the plan should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of the costly open-ended entitlement status of today's program. These two essential changes are:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The guaranteed populations and benefits -- the entitlement -- should be sharply limited, and focused on politically weak groups traditionally ignored by the states, such as the homeless and those with severe mental illness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not an entitlement to states. States do need protection from unanticipated changes that would make them vulnerable under a strict block grant, but this should be in the form of a fund voted on each year and distributed according to a formula devised by Congress to meet specific problems. It should not be a blank check to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then Medicaid, like other federal programs, will require more, not less, fiscal discipline. In reforming Medicaid, lawmakers must make sure that the precise legislative language does not create a legal loophole for state officials who have acquired expertise in "gaming" the Medicaid program at the expense of federal taxpayers.

<title>Yet Another Sham Welfare Reform: Examining the NGA Plan - Heritage</title>

<h3>YET ANOTHER SHAM WELFARE REFORM:<br>
EXAMINING THE NGA PLAN </h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The National Governors' Association (NGA) is proposing a new welfare reform plan, and Congress has initiated hearings on the governors' proposal. Unfortunately, this proposal, crafted by NGA bureaucrats and borrowing significant elements from President Clinton's welfare reform schemes, is another blueprint for flawed welfare reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of Congress should realize that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements of the Contract With America proposed by conservatives in the fall of 1994. The Contract contained a solid, comprehensive welfare reform based on three themes:
<p><ul>
<li><b> A national goal of reducing illegitimacy</b> and establishing a number of modest national policies to advance that goal;<p>

<li><b> National work requirements</b> for AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) recipients; and<p>

<li><b> Greater flexibility to state governments</b> in the operation of welfare programs.<sup>1</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House/Senate conference bill passed by Congress, and vetoed by President Clinton on January 9, retained these three basic elements of reform, albeit with the pro-marriage provisions weakened. But the NGA plan effectively eliminates the first two principles of reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Decision makers enticed by the NGA's "bipartisan" reform package would do well to remember history. America supposedly ended welfare just eight years ago, when Congress in 1988 passed a comprehensive "bipartisan" reform which promised to replace welfare with work. This so-called reform, also predominantly shaped by the NGA, turned out to be a sham:  Daycare spending soared; welfare caseloads skyrocketed; even today, almost no welfare recipients are required to work. With the NGA bureaucracy again in the lead, history is about to repeat itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan is heavily flawed in four key aspects.
<p>
<b>1) The plan abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy.</b> NGA officials have completely misdefined the real goal of reform. Their plan explicitly abandons the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy, which was the number one welfare reform plank in the Contract With America; the shift is so complete that the governors' policy declaration does not mention rising illegitimacy even as a minor social problem, let alone propose a reform structure to deal with it.
<p>
<b>2) The plan eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients.</b> The plan drawn up by the NGA bureaucracy completely guts the work requirements from the House-Senate conference bill and substitutes bogus requirements designed to deceive the public while preserving the status quo. The work requirements in the NGA plan are far weaker than those in the Democratic alternative bills supported by President Clinton, S.1117, introduced by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) in the Senate, and the amendment to H.R. 4 introduced by Representative Nathan Deal (D-GA) in the House. In fact, under the NGA plan, no welfare recipients will be required to work.
<p>
<b>3) The plan has a pervasive anti-marriage bias.</b> Since the NGA bureaucracy rejected reducing out-of-wedlock birth rates as a reform goal, it is not surprising that the plan is indifferent, or effectively hostile, to marriage throughout. To the extent it modifies the conference welfare bill passed in the House and Senate, the NGA plan systematically discriminates against marriage. Further, it would penalize financially those states which pursue a pro-marriage welfare strategy and reward those which concentrate on the narrow goal of providing job-training and employment to single mothers.
<p>
<b>4) The plan embodies the Clinton Administration's "reform" structure.</b> The NGA plan incorporates many major elements of President Clinton's anti-dependency plans. As such, the governors' proposal encourages states to pursue the least efficient strategies for reducing welfare dependence and penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.
<p>

<b>ABANDONING MARRIAGE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most important element of any reform plan is the goal. If the goal is set properly, all other elements eventually will fall into place. If the nation sets the wrong goal, no amount of tinkering will help. The number one goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage and reduce illegitimacy. All else is secondary. Setting a clear, paramount goal of reducing illegitimacy also serves a public education function:  It frames the debate, alerts Americans to what is truly important, and establishes social expectations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' proposal is a failure because it sets the wrong goal. NGA officials declare that there are three "crucial elements" of real welfare reform:
<p><ul>
<li> Providing more government-funded daycare;
<p>
<li> Increasing child support payments from absent fathers; and 
<p>
<li> Imposing time limits and work requirements (with gaping loopholes) for welfare recipients.<sup>2</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise in illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not even merit a concerned comment, let alone aggressive policies, from the NGA.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, over the last year, the focus of the welfare debate has undergone a radical metamorphosis, from combating illegitimacy to providing public support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Eschewing the issue of illegitimacy, the NGA plan instead appears as a preparation for a future in which marriage plays a sharply diminishing role in America, and the government is heavily involved in meeting the needs of an ever-growing population of single-parent families. The triumph of liberals on this aspect of the debate has been complete:  Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government daycare is "in." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan, borrowing heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals, dovetails neatly with the interests of America's enormous welfare bureaucracy:  an industry that thrives on social decay. While the plan will trim the growth rate in welfare spending slightly in the near term, by failing to deal with ballooning rates of illegitimacy it sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social service spending in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nor are the governors alone. Under its recently passed version of welfare reform, the Republican-controlled Congress has committed itself to spending nearly half a trillion dollars, over the next seven years to subsidize and support illegitimacy and single parenthood through multiple welfare benefits, daycare, job training, and other services. Under the congressional plan, government will spend $1,000 to subsidize single parenthood and illegitimacy for each dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA welfare reform plan will distort these priorities even further. When the dust settles on welfare reform, even token efforts to fight illegitimacy will have fallen by the wayside.

<P>
<b>The Crisis of Illegitimacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But decisive action to deal with the collapse of the family is urgently needed. Last year, nearly one-third of American children were born out of wedlock. Even worse, the illegitimate birth rate continues to rise relentlessly -- by about one percentage point each and every year. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. This figure astounds even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), who first issued his prophetic warnings about the erosion of marriage among blacks in the early 1960s. Moynihan's warning was vilified at the time, but the breakup of the black family and the accompanying social calamities have far outstripped his worst nightmares. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ominously, the illegitimate birth rate among whites now is edging toward 25 percent -- almost exactly equaling the black rate when Moynihan first raised his alarm. The white family is teetering on the same precipice, heading rapidly toward the same lethal decomposition that devastated black communities in the late 1960s and 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The collapse of marriage and the concomitant rise in illegitimacy together form the number one problem facing America; family collapse is the root cause of other social problems, such as poverty, crime, drug abuse, and school failure.<sup>4</sup>  Some reasons why:
<p><ul>
<li>Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those born to couples who remain married. 
<p>
<li>Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out-of wedlock themselves than are girls from intact non-welfare families. 
<p>
<li>A boy from a single-parent home in the inner city is twice as likely to engage in crime as a similar boy who is poor but living with a father and a mother.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some would argue that federal action on illegitimacy is unneeded:  If left alone, the governors will tackle the problem on their own. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few, if any, governors have made reducing illegitimacy a central theme of reform; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. By refusing to acknowledge or mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out of wedlock and raised in government-supported daycare centers. This is not reform. It is a national disaster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage. But the governors have formally stated that promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is not a meaningful part of their reform plan. If the House and Senate adopt the governors' plan, they will have agreed with them and will have abandoned even token efforts to stem the rise of illegitimacy and decline of marriage in American society.
<p>

<b>THE NGA'S SHAM WORK REQUIREMENTS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly 90 percent of Americans believe that welfare recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. In response to this public pressure, the U.S. welfare establishment has a simple solution:  sham work requirements that create the illusion that beneficiaries must work while, in fact, few actually do. For example, as part of the 1988 welfare reform (the Family Support Act) the public was told that "welfare will be replaced by work."  But the NGA opposed real work requirements. As a consequence, the reform, enacted by a nearly unanimous bipartisan vote in the Senate, was a sham. Daycare funding exploded, AFDC caseload grew by some 30 percent, and today only some 2 to 3 percent of AFDC recipients actually are required to work. History is about to repeat itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A major provision of the conference bill passed by Congress is a requirement that some AFDC recipients must work.5  Section 407 of the bill requires certain percentages of the AFDC caseload to work for benefits and provides a fairly tight definition of work. However, even these work participation requirements have loopholes. For example, up to 20 percent of those counted as working can be in vocational education instead.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The following table shows the nominal work participation rates in the conference bill and the real rates, once loopholes are taken into consideration. 
<center><P>
<table border>
<tr><th>YEAR</th><th>Nominal Participation Rates</th><th>Real Participation Rates</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>1996</td><td>15%</td><td>10.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1997</td><td>20%</td><td>14%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1998</td><td>25%</td><td>17.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1999</td><td>30%</td><td>21%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2000</td><td>35%</td><td>24.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2001</td><td>40%</td><td>28%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2002</td><td>50%</td><td>35%</td>
</tr></table></center><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, in the typical state, some 10 percent of AFDC recipients already are employed, voluntarily, in part-time jobs and can properly be counted toward the state work requirement rate. This means that, in the typical state, only 25 percent of AFDC recipients would be required to work by 2002.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even this rate is far too high for the NGA. While the NGA proposal nominally accepts the work participation rates from the conference report, the plan actually includes a cavernous loophole which effectively obliterates all work requirements. The NGA proposes to count routine caseload turnover toward the work participation rates, so any AFDC recipient who ever obtained work and left AFDC could be counted toward the participation requirement. It is important to note that there always has been a considerable turnover in the AFDC caseload. Hundreds of thousands of recipients obtain jobs and leave AFDC in any given year as an equal or greater number of persons enroll. This routine turnover occurs even when total AFDC caseloads are rising rapidly. The governors wish to be given credit for this automatic turnover and to portray the status quo as successful reform.<sup>7</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By claiming credit for individuals who have obtained a job and left AFDC during the last 24 months, a governor could automatically obtain a work "participation rate" of roughly 40 percent without in any way altering the existing welfare system.<sup>8</sup>  Nearly all states would be able to meet their work requirements for the next seven without the least change in the status quo. Thus, the NGA bill is almost a perfect repeat of the bogus 1988 reform. Once again, complicated sham work requirements will be substituted for the real thing.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the Clinton Administration is enthusiastic about counting normal caseload turnover as "work."  Very similar "credit for turnover" provisions played a key role in the Democratic alternative reform legislation rejected earlier this year in the House and Senate. Congressional Republicans at the time denounced these provisions as a crude effort to deceive the voters. It would be ironic if a Republican-controlled Congress now embraced the same deception.
<p>

<b>BUT ISN'T ENDING AFDC ENTITLEMENTS THE KEY TO REFORM?</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is true that the NGA plan does end the entitlement status of AFDC and eliminates many of the unnecessary restrictions in the existing AFDC code, thereby giving greater flexibility to the states.<sup>9</sup>  Replacing automatic entitlement funding with block grants also imposes greater fiscal discipline on each state. Under the current entitlement system, when a state expands its AFDC caseload, it gets an automatic increase in federal AFDC funds. If a state shrinks its caseload, its federal funding is cut. If the current automatic entitlement funding mechanism were replaced by a block grant system, each state would be given a fixed amount. Since the block grant amount would not expand automatically if a state's AFDC caseload grew, a block grant funding system would give states a greater incentive to curtail caseload growth.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current entitlement nature of AFDC is objectionable and should be eliminated. However, eliminating entitlement status alone is not reform, or even a small part of reform. The impact of eliminating the entitlement nature of AFDC has been greatly overrated. Under the current funding system, states must match federal AFDC funding in the state (generally the state pays 40 to 50 percent of total AFDC costs within the state). Thus, states always have had a strong financial incentive to curtail AFDC caseload growth; this, however, has not prevented the program from swelling to the point where one out of five children receives benefits each year.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been recent efforts to exaggerate the importance of ending AFDC's entitlement status. For example, it has been claimed that ending the entitlement status and "block granting" were the only welfare goals of the Reagan Administration. This is misleading. A hallmark of welfare policy under President Reagan was the effort to establish national work requirements for welfare recipients. Bills to accomplish this aim were introduced year after year during the Reagan presidency.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, eliminating AFDC entitlements would have only a modest effect on reform. Other far more significant factors in shaping reform at the state level are the overall framing of the welfare debate and the shaping of public expectations; the actual goal of reform in the minds of decision makers; the momentum of past policies; the vast influence of the state welfare bureaucracies; and the explicit goals, incentives, and requirements established by the federal government.<sup>10</sup>

<p>
<b>OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE NGA PLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan would create a huge performance incentive fund, costing roughly $6 billion over the next seven years. This fund -- a central feature of the Clinton reform strategy -- would provide cash bonuses to states which have higher rates of AFDC mothers obtaining jobs. This is a very limited and illogical measure of success. For example, increasing marriage and reducing out-of-wedlock births would have far more beneficial effects on children and society than merely increasing employment of single mothers. But the NGA plan is indifferent or hostile to the issues of illegitimacy and marriage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the more limited perspective of reducing welfare dependence, the NGA plan is illogical. 
Welfare dependence can be reduced by six means:
<p><ul>
<li> Reducing illegitimacy;<P>
<li> Reducing divorce;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among women who have had children out of wedlock but have not yet enrolled in welfare;<P>
<li> Encouraging single mothers to take jobs before they enter AFDC;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among welfare mothers; and<p>
<li> Having welfare mothers obtain jobs.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employment of welfare mothers is, in fact, the least effective of these six mechanisms for purposes of shrinking dependence, reducing child poverty, and enhancing the well-being of children. However, employing welfare mothers is the mechanism which least disrupts the ideological status quo and it is attractive to the huge welfare bureaucracy, whose material interests require a growing population of welfare recipients needing more and more services, such as daycare and training. Hence, despite its irrationality, the employment of welfare mothers remains the almost exclusive focus of the NGA plan. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan thus is narrowly focused on the least effective means of reducing dependence and the one which is least beneficial to children. Under the proposal, states which concentrate on other aspects of reform would bear a heavy financial penalty. But by encouraging states to focus on the least effective and least desirable means of reducing dependence, the governor's plan actually will slow the reduction of welfare dependence.<sup>11</sup> 
<p>

<b>Rewards for Bogus "Success" </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA's focus on "exits from welfare," borrowed from the Clinton Administration, is illogical. The evidence indicates that serious work requirements have their strongest impact not by encouraging people to leave welfare, but by reducing the number of persons who bother to apply for welfare in the first place. Similarly, a state which restricts welfare entry to the truly needy (those who are the least able to support themselves) almost certainly will have proportionally fewer "exits" from the welfare caseload than would states with more liberal entrance standards.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The entire notion of measuring success in welfare by caseload exits makes no sense. It is like measuring success in the war on drugs not by a decline in drug use, but by an increase in the number of persons passing through rehabilitation, or judging the nation's health by counting the number of successful exits from hospitals -- a criterion which might be popular among hospital administrators but would make no sense for society at large. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, there is little relationship between "employment exits" and the level of welfare dependence or caseload size. In the NGA plan, there is no requirement that "successful" states actually lower caseloads. States would be rewarded for "success" even when their caseloads were consistently growing. If, for example, the NGA "performance incentive fund" had been created seven years ago, states automatically would have been rewarded with billions for "success," year after year, while their AFDC caseloads were growing between 25 and 30 percent. Unfortunately, the creation of bogus measurements of successful reform is no accident -- such measures are a key element in the welfare industry's strategy to forestall real change.
<p>
<b>Anti-Marriage Bias</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the limited perspective of promoting welfare exits, the NGA plan is inconsistent. The NGA bureaucrats would reward states when a single mother gets a job and leaves welfare, but give no reward if a mother marries and gets off welfare -- even though the marriage is far more effective in reducing long-term dependence and poverty. In keeping with the prevailing ideology of the nation's welfare establishment, the NGA plan is heavily biased against marriage and focused on obtaining employment for single mothers.
<p>
<b>No Real Money for Reducing Illegitimacy </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vetoed House-Senate conference bill did contain a fund to reward states which reduced illegitimacy without increasing abortions, and the NGA plan retained this. However, it is useful to compare this illegitimacy reduction bonus fund with the NGA's "performance incentive fund," which rewards the employment of AFDC mothers. The performance incentive fund rewards states on a comparative or relative scale; states would be ranked, and states with higher employment records relative to other states would be given substantial bonuses. Such a comparative reward system creates automatic winners; cash incentives will be paid out automatically under the plan even if the overall level of real performance remains the same or deteriorates. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, the illegitimacy ratio bonus fund is linked to absolute -- not relative -- performance, so a state must achieve a real reduction in its illegitimacy ratio (the proportion of births which are out of wedlock) in order to receive a reward. The requirements are very difficult to achieve -- so much so that little or no bonus money actually will be paid from this fund. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA thus has adopted very tough absolute standards for rewarding illegitimacy reduction but lax comparative standards for rewarding employment. Yet the latter standards guarantee winners. Consequently, under the NGA plan, little or no money would be paid to reward states for efforts to reduce illegitimacy, while $6 billion in rewards would be given automatically for efforts to employ welfare mothers. Once again, the NGA's relentless bias against promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is apparent. 

<p>
<b>Large Increases in Mandatory Day Care Funding</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The House-Senate conference bill increased federal daycare funding by $2 billion over seven years. The NGA plan would require another $4 billion. Overall, this means that federal daycare funding would be increased by a third. States would be required to spend all the increased funds on daycare even if they would prefer to spend it on other services to the poor.
<P>
<b>Family Cap </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conference bill prohibited states from using federal funds to give higher welfare benefits to women who have children out of wedlock while already enrolled in AFDC; states could choose to "opt out" of this restriction by enacting specific legislation. The governors' plan eliminates the family cap provision entirely. As under current law, states could have a family cap if they wish, but there is no legal impetus for them to do so.<sup>12</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The family cap is not only sound policy; it is widely supported by the public. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."<sup>13</sup>  The popularity of the family cap is so great that the Clinton Administration does not publicly oppose the policy. Nor did the White House cite the inclusion of the family cap provision as a reason for its veto of the House/Senate conference bill.
<p>

<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Contract With America advanced three principles of welfare reform:  promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy, requiring work, and increasing state flexibility. The NGA plan abandons the first two of these principles despite the fact that they are supported overwhelmingly by the public. Real welfare reform must carry out the principles of the Contract.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Restoring a sensible debate on marriage and illegitimacy is crucial. This issue has been trivialized or ignored by those pretending it is merely a question of whether the family cap provision in the House/Senate conference bill should be retained or eliminated. In reality, conservatives have proposed nearly a dozen national measures aimed at reducing illegitimacy. Many were included in the Contract With America. But in each case, they have been resisted by the Washington establishment and, one by one, they have been whittled away. What is now required is a complete reorientation of the debate back to the topic of illegitimacy, and the establishment of multiple measures to deal with the problem. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to produce real reform, the following ten steps are needed.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1)</b> The leadership of the House and Senate should assert publicly that reducing illegitimacy is the key goal in welfare reform and should commit to an ongoing effort to use the "bully pulpit" to raise concern about the collapse of marriage in society.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2)</b> The family cap provision of the conference bill (with the opt out clause) should be retained in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3)</b> The illegitimacy reduction bonus fund established in the conference bill is a good idea and should be retained. However, the criteria for successful performance are so strict that even those states which make serious attempts to reduce illegitimacy will be unlikely to achieve them. Of course, incentive bonuses which are nearly unobtainable are not likely to have much effect on state plans and activities. The success criteria for this fund should be softened to give states a more realistic opportunity to obtain the bonuses. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4)</b> The NGA performance incentive fund rewards only employment by welfare mothers, even though this is the least effective and least desirable way of reducing dependence. The fund should be altered to reward a composite score of all of the following:  a reduced illegitimacy rate, reduced divorce rate, reduced AFDC application rate, increased AFDC employment exits, and increased AFDC marital exits. Moreover, states should be rewarded only if caseload and illegitimacy actually are declining.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5)</b> States should be given the option of providing food commodities rather than food stamp coupons to AFDC mothers and retaining any resultant savings for other anti-poverty efforts. By reducing the attractiveness of the welfare life-style, this policy has the potential to greatly reduce future out-of-wedlock births.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6)</b> The amount of funding in the conference bill's abstinence program should be increased from $75 million to $200 million per year in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>7)</b> Each state should be required to submit a plan showing how it intends to reduce illegitimacy. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>8)</b> Within the existing AFDC program, a new set-aside fund should be established providing $300 million per year for states to devise their own programs to reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion (with firm evaluations required).
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>9)</b> The work requirements in the conference bill should not be weakened or undermined through the governors' proposal to count employment exits. Performance goals should not be linked to exits in any way, since the best reform schemes will reduce enrollments rather than increase exits. The hourly work requirements for AFDC recipients, especially AFDC-UP fathers, should not be reduced.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>10)</b> Under the bill, daycare funds could be spent only for daycare even if the governors wish to use them for other services for the poor. This "lock in" of the daycare money should be eliminated in future legislation.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On the crucial issues of work and illegitimacy, the NGA plan resembles the Democratic alternative bills introduced in the House and Senate much more closely than it does the original Contract With America. Indeed, the work requirements in the NGA plan actually are weaker than those in either Democratic bill.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The welfare "reform" proposed by the National Governors' Association is, in reality, an anti-reform. The NGA has abandoned the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy. Instead, NGA officials call for a massive investment in government daycare for an expanding population of single-parent families. The NGA seeks to abolish the work requirements in the conference bill passed by the House and Senate and to substitute sham requirements in their place. The bill is biased against marriage. The NGA has adopted a reward and incentive system which has as its exclusive goal the employment of single mothers despite the fact that this is the least effective means of reducing dependence and improving children's well-being.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sham reforms such as that proposed by the NGA are very harmful. By creating the illusion of reform, bogus reform reduces public pressure for change and thereby helps to preserve the existing system. The bogus welfare reforms of 1988, created in large part by the NGA, delayed action on real reform for nearly a decade. This sad mistake should not be repeated.

<li>Statement on "Welfare Reform" as adopted by the governors on February 6, 1996.<p>
<li>In an February 29, 1996, article in the <I>Washington Times</I>, entitled "Can Welfare Reform Survive Friendly Fire?"  Robert Carleson maintains that the National Governors' Association did not ignore the catastrophic rise in illegitimacy. Carleson cites "findings" contained in the welfare legislation passed last year by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton. The findings say that illegitimacy is harmful. It is important to note, however, that these findings are merely rhetorical and are not linked to policy. It is true that the NGA, as a practical matter, used the conference bill passed by Congress as a textual base and amended it to produce its own proposed policy. But one can be quite certain that no governor actually looked at the huge conference tome, and it would be very surprising if any governor was aware of the few paragraphs of legally irrelevant "findings" buried deep within the 650-page conference document. Certainly no one at the NGA seems to have regarded these forlorn paragraphs as important. All one need do is listen to the NGA's own words. In its official statement of policy, reducing illegitimacy is not mentioned as a goal or "crucial element" of reform, and the NGA, of course, makes not the slightest reference to the "findings" on illegitimacy. <p>
<li>See Patrick F. Fagan, "Rising Illegitimacy:  America's Social Catastrophe," Heritage Foundation <I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 19, June 29, 1994. See also Patrick F. Fagan, "The Real Root Causes of Violent Crime:  The Breakdown of Marriage, Family, and Community," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1026, March 17, 1995.<p>
<li>Some of the "work" requirements in the conference bill are illusory; for example, individuals who have received AFDC for over two years are required to "work," but a state may count one hour of job search per year as "working."  These "requirements" are very similar to the cosmetic provisions of the sham reform of 1988. However, the work provisions of Section 407 of the bill are quite different, and for the first time in the history of AFDC, require a certain percentage of recipients actually to work <p>
<li>Another loophole permits states to subtract women with children under age one from the denominator for purposes of calculating their work participation rate. Such women comprise about 10 percent of the AFDC caseload; excluding them from the caseload count effectively cuts the required work participation rates by 10 percent.<P>
<li>It is important to understand the distinction between routine caseload turnover and net caseload reduction. With caseload turnover, a certain number of persons leave the welfare rolls but an equal or greater number enter; the total size of the caseload remains the same or increases. With net caseload reduction, the actual number of persons on welfare declines due to a drop in enrollments or an increase in exits which exceeds new enrollments. Caseload turnover is omnipresent and meaningless; it not a valid measure of success in reducing dependence. Caseload reduction is difficult to achieve and has rarely occurred in the history of AFDC. The goal of welfare reform is not to increase the number of persons cycled through the welfare system (although the welfare bureaucracy would like such a goal); it is to reduce the level of dependence. Caseload reduction is a proper measure of that goal. The House-Senate conference bill established performance standards which gave states proper credit for anti-dependency efforts which resulted in real caseload reduction, but not for mere turnover.<p>
<li>NGA bureaucrats in fact are demanding any individual who has ever obtained a job and left AFDC be counted toward the state's work participation rate. The figures become very complex since these individuals would be counted in both numerator and denominator for purposes of calculating the participation rate. However, the bottom line is simple:  Even if caseload turnover only for the prior six months is counted, the actual work standards in the bill would be gutted, at least through the end of this century.<p>
<li>In particular, the plan would eliminate the current JOBS program, which has made it difficult for states to operate serious workfare programs.<p>
<li>However, some proponents of the NGA plan regard ending the entitlement nature of AFDC not only as the most important, but as the only acceptable element of reform. Such individuals tend to adhere to the philosophy of "value neutral revenue sharing."  Under this doctrine, the federal government should collect the revenue for the welfare system and hand it over to state governments with no requirement other than that the funds be spent to aid the poor. According to this narrow doctrine, most of the welfare provisions of the Contract With America (and especially those dealing with work and illegitimacy) are not only unnecessary, but also highly objectionable. From this perspective, "success" in welfare reform necessarily means opposing and eliminating most of the Contract's welfare provisions as unwanted impediments on the states. Not surprisingly, the NGA plan draws very high praise from adherents of this view. However, this seems to be a perspective which is not widely shared.<p>
<li>It could be argued reasonably that the rewards and incentives provided in the NGA plan are irrational but that this fact is of lessened importance because it is greatly outweighed by the impact of removing the AFDC entitlement funding mechanism. In this view, giving each state a fixed-sum block grant creates an implicit fiscal discipline which will drive states to pursue rational means to reduce dependency, irrespective of the explicit, contrary system of goals and bonus incentives. However, in the experience of this writer, explicit goals, reform concepts, and rewards play a very large role in shaping the outlook of state-level bureaucrats and decision makers, a role which greatly outweighs any implicit fiscal impetus. <p>
<li>Under the current law, a state government must request a federal waiver to enact the family cap. Under the NGA plan, a waiver would no longer be needed.<p>
<li>Family Research Council poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, mid-October 1995. The poll surveyed 1,000 randomly selected American adults about their views on welfare and social issues and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel long has sought a comprehensive peace with its Arab neighbors, and has made great progress since the landmark 1991 peace conference in Madrid. It signed a peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 and concluded a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. But negotiations with Syria have proceeded at a glacial pace. One of the major obstacles in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations has been Syrian insistence on recovering the strategic Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, without ironclad security guarantees that Syria would not use the Golan as a staging area for aggression against Israel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has tried to bridge the negotiating gap by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor compliance with any agreement, but it has resisted congressional calls to examine the wisdom of such a commitment, claiming that a public debate would be premature. Administration officials contend that the details of a peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights have not been worked out and a final commitment has not been made. However, Defense Secretary William Perry, after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on January 8, confirmed the Clinton Administration's long-standing offer to provide U.S. peacekeeping forces to monitor the Golan Heights. Although Perry had said last September that the U.S. "should be willing" to contribute forces that would facilitate a peace accord, he recently firmed up the U.S. offer by proclaiming, "we are prepared to do that."<sup>1 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress Should Hold Hearings.</b> Now that Secretary Perry has explicitly made this offer, Congress should hold hearings to examine the potential costs and benefits of this commitment. It also should press the Administration to reconsider its risky plans to enter such an open-ended peacekeeping operation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Administration has resisted congressional scrutiny of the Golan peacekeeping question, arguing that it could complicate efforts to negotiate a peace agreement. While this may be true, the Administration would be wise to gauge congressional support for a possible Golan peacekeeping operation now, rather than risk having an agreement unravel later due to congressional disapproval.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has its own reasons for debating a Golan peacekeeping commitment sooner rather than later, as underscored by the recent experience in Bosnia. The rapid pace of developments in the Bosnian peace negotiations greatly limited congressional debate, with U.S. troops being deployed to Bosnia only 11 days after the November 21, 1995, signing of the Dayton peace accords. While the pace of Syrian-Israeli negotiations is likely to be slower, Congress must address the Golan peacekeeping issue before, not after, the Israelis and Syrians negotiate a deal if it wants to avoid being presented with another diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i> by the Clinton Administration.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Israel is a sovereign state, and it is Israel's prerogative to negotiate whatever diplomatic arrangements it finds necessary to assure its security and promote peace. Washington should actively support efforts to build a just and lasting Arab-Israeli peace.<sup>2</sup>  But when America is asked to ensure the implementation of an agreement which entails obvious risks to American peacekeepers, the U.S. Congress has a right and duty to examine the risks and benefits of such a commitment, as it would do with any other peacekeeping commitment.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Congress examines the Golan Heights peacekeeping issue, it should bear in mind that American troops should not be involved in such a mission. There are five reasons for this conclusion.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing U.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula. Unlike the American troops assigned to the multinational peacekeeping force on the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai since 1982, peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be sandwiched between two large armored forces in a much smaller area. Moreover, Syria historically has been much more hostile to the U.S. than has Egypt, which is now a U.S. ally. Thus, a Golan peacekeeping operation would be much riskier.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. U.S. peacekeeping forces in the Golan will be close to southern Lebanon, which is a major staging area for numerous terrorist groups that oppose Arab-Israeli peace.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. An American presence on the Golan will constrain Israel's military options more than Syria's and will sap Israel's self-reliance. In the long run, this could strain U.S.-Israel relations.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. A small force will be unable to defend itself against possible terrorist or Syrian military attacks, while a large force will be a major drain on active U.S. Army forces.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. Other countries can play the same peacekeeping role. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, comprised of troops from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland, has been deployed on the Golan for almost 22 years to monitor the 1974 Syrian-Israeli Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under no circumstances should the U.S. promise foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. The prospective recovery of the Golan Heights and peace itself are Syria's peace dividends. Moreover, the U.S. should remember that it has important national interests to advance regarding Syria that go beyond brokering a Syrian-Israeli peace agreement. Congress must prevent the Administration's preoccupation with the peace process from obscuring American interests in halting Syrian support of terrorism, promoting Lebanon's independence from Syrian domination, ending Syrian subversion of Turkey, halting drug smuggling in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, and isolating Syria's ally Iran.
<p>

<b>THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE GOLAN HEIGHTS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Golan Heights comprise some of the most strategically significant terrain in the world. Occupying its high forward slopes gives Israel line-of-sight surveillance of Syrian military movements and electronic communications. Electronic intelligence-gathering facilities in the Golan provide early warning of threatening developments in the plains southwest of the Syrian capital of Damascus, or in south Lebanon. Control of the Golan also provides Israel, a small country, with something it badly needs:  a buffer zone to give it strategic depth. Before losing the Heights in 1967, Syria used its commanding position on the Golan to bombard the Israeli settlements in the nearby Galilee region. Highly lucrative agricultural and tourist sites around the shores of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) now are safe. Finally, the Golan highlands form a watershed that supplies approximately 30 percent of Israel's water. Dominating the Golan watershed means potential control of this vital freshwater resource. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For these strategic reasons, most past Israeli governments, whether led by the Labor or Likud parties, have not been willing to withdraw from the Golan, which the Israel Defense Force (IDF) captured in a bold and courageous operation in 1967. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin began direct negotiations with Syria under American auspices after his June 1992 election, but declined to specify how far Israel would withdraw on the Golan until Damascus made clear what kind of peace and security arrangements it was willing to make. Syria's Hafez al-Assad broke off the talks in July 1995, insisting on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights. After Rabin's November 4 assassination, his successor, former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, dropped Rabin's insistence that security arrangements be dealt with first.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Peres used his December 12, 1995, speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress to appeal to Assad to resume the talks. Assad agreed and the talks were revived on December 27. Two rounds of Syrian-Israeli talks already have been held at the Wye Plantation in eastern Maryland, and a third round began on January 23. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has offered to undertake open-ended shuttle diplomacy between the two countries to bridge the still-wide gaps. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though Israel is eager to make peace and maintain the momentum generated by the diplomatic breakthrough with the Palestinians reached in Oslo in 1993, many Israelis are deeply concerned about the potential threat to their security if the IDF withdraws and the Syrian army moves back onto the Golan. The position of the Peres government is that the benefits of a deal with Syria outweigh the risks and that Israel must deal now, while the opportunity exists, and while Israel is in a position of strength. But most Israelis nevertheless believe that only extraordinary security guarantees can make the return of the Golan to Syria acceptable. 

<p>
<b>FIVE REASONS TO REJECT U.S. PEACEKEEPING IN THE GOLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One possible guarantee is the deployment of U.S. troops on the Golan, either as part of a multinational operation or alone, and either in a pure "peacekeeping" role or as a kind of tripwire to hedge against renewed hostilities from Syria. This possibility has been a matter of speculation in Washington for over two years. The Clinton Administration has aggressively discouraged congressional consideration of the issue, maintaining that it is premature to address the issue of an American peacekeeping force on the Golan.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Secretary Perry's January 8 statement indicating that the U.S. is prepared to deploy a Golan peacekeeping force has considerably undermined this argument. Congress soon must consider the implications of a U.S. peacekeeping deployment on the Golan, or it will find itself reacting to a diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>, as in Bosnia. While examining the Golan peacekeeping issue, Congress should bear in mind five reasons that the U.S. should reject a U.S. peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #1:</b>  The Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing mission on the Sinai Peninsula. U.S. and Israeli officials often cite the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), which monitors compliance with the security arrangements in the Sinai peninsula, as a model for an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan. The MFO, created in 1982 to monitor compliance with the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, is composed of three battalions of troops from Colombia, Fiji, and the U.S. and a Civilian Observer Unit staffed with American personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, however, would operate in a markedly different geographic, military, and political environment. Rather than being deployed in a vast, empty desert far from the main bodies of the opposing military forces, Golan peacekeepers would be stationed in a constricted area, sandwiched between large armored forces in positions that would quickly become important military objectives if fighting were to break out. Unlike the remote, sparsely populated Sinai, the Golan also would be a more hospitable operating theater for terrorists based in neighboring Lebanon or among civilians living in the Golan Heights. Finally, Hafez al-Assad's Syria today is a far cry from Anwar Sadat's Egypt. Not only has Syria supported terrorists that have killed Americans and provoked military clashes with the U.S. in Lebanon in 1983, but Assad is extremely unlikely to become a reliable U.S. ally in the future, unlike Sadat's Egypt.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much depends on the details of an Israel-Syrian treaty. If an agreement leads to the removal of a standing Syrian mechanized army within 40 kilometers of the Golan, then U.S. troops, as in the Sinai MFO, might play a useful role in monitoring or verifying compliance with the treaty. But if large Syrian forces remain deployed close by and a significant potential security threat remains, then a mere monitoring mission makes little sense. In essence, the U.S. force would be serving as a deterrent or tripwire to prevent Syria reverting to the use of arms.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There also are major questions about size, composition, mission, and command and control of the Golan force. An MFO-like monitoring force would be small and lightly armed. But a small, light force would have difficulty protecting itself from terror attacks emanating from Lebanon, let alone a Syrian military offensive. Therefore, a U.S. peacekeeping force in the Golan would have to be large enough to deter attacks from any source and defend itself. In other words, it must be a large combat formation, configured for possible combat, with appropriate rules of engagement. But a large force, such as an armored or mechanized infantry brigade, would be costly and a drain on the U.S. military presence in more important regions such as Europe or South Korea.<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #2:</b>  Terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops. Unlike the Sinai MFO, Golan peacekeepers would be vulnerable to significant terrorist threats. They would be stationed close to southern and eastern Lebanon, the staging area for some of the world's most dangerous terrorists, including Hezbollah, the militant pro-Iranian terrorist group responsible for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Hezbollah and other terrorist groups operating in Lebanon have a history of attacking Americans. They will have even more reason to use terrorism to disrupt an American-brokered peace agreement that they violently oppose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Syria itself is one of the chief exporters of international terrorism.<sup>3</sup>  Assad repeatedly has used terrorism as an adjunct of foreign policy in inter-Arab politics, in Lebanon, and against Israel. He also supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon in 1983-1984. Given his success in helping Hezbollah to drive U.S. peacekeepers out of Lebanon in 1984, Assad may try a similar strategy in the Golan if he decides to seek their removal. Even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, however, Iran, Iraq, and Libya could support Lebanon-based terrorist proxies against U.S. forces in the Golan. Since U.S. troops will be a lightning rod for terrorism, particularly due to American brokering of a Syrian-Israel peace accord, a Golan peacekeeping operation should not be manned by Americans.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #3:</b>  It could adversely affect U.S.-Israel relations. A peacekeeping force is supposed to be a neutral, honest broker, but maintaining a neutral stance is likely to have a negative political, military, and psychological impact on U.S.-Israeli relations. This would be particularly true if the U.S. maintains strict neutrality with respect to Israel and Syria in the implementation of any agreement. At a minimum, sharp differences of opinion are likely to arise concerning compliance issues and the interpretation of Syrian activities along the border. Deeper strains in the bilateral relationship could occur if Israel concluded that the peacekeeping forces were turning a blind eye to Syrian violations of the peace treaty or if Washington concluded that Israel was overreacting to minor or ambiguous Syrian violations. It should be remembered that American participation in the 1982-1984 multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon led to considerable friction with Israel and at one point an American Marine officer brandished a pistol to halt the advance of an Israeli tank.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A U.S. presence on the Golan also will sap Israeli self-reliance. Because Syria adamantly rejects allowing Israel to maintain early warning facilities in the Golan as an infringement on its sovereignty, Israel is likely to become more dependent on U.S. spy satellites and aircraft. The U.S. presence also will put a brake on Israeli military operations in the event of conflict with Syria or terrorists in Lebanon. Their presence will constrain Israel's military options, possibly depriving Israel of the opportunity to launch a preemptive military strike if a Syrian attack was imminent. Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked. They are likely to constitute only a marginal military deterrent to Syria and they will be unable to provide adequate early warning to Israel.<sup>4</sup>  The real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the U.S. will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts. This is dangerous because it could engender a false sense of security that could lead Israelis to take more risks in peace negotiations with Syria than they otherwise would take.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #4:</b>  It could be too costly and too much of a drain on U.S. forces. The U.S. cannot afford to commit an ever-larger proportion of its declining active duty forces to worldwide peacekeeping operations. Sending U.S. troops to Haiti and Bosnia already has depleted America's strategic reserve and could jeopardize American interests by stretching U.S. forces thin around the world. It should be remembered that the peacekeeping commitments to Haiti and Bosnia, and now possibly on the Golan as well, were made in addition to the existing military alliance commitments in Europe and Asia -- and even as the Clinton Administration is trying to cut the defense budget even further.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For a Golan peacekeeping mission to be credible, it would require the commitment of a large force consisting of at least a heavy brigade, roughly 5,000 troops. To maintain a long term deployment of this force, three brigades would have to be dedicated to the mission:  one on deployment, one recovering and retraining after returning from the mission, and one training and preparing to deploy on the mission. This is roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength, a prohibitively high burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission. If the U.S. is suddenly faced with conflict in other regions of the world, such as the Persian Gulf or the Korean peninsula, the forces on the Golan could be sorely needed to protect vital U.S. national interests.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to diverting troops from other, more important missions, an open-ended peacekeeping mission on the Golan will reduce the military effectiveness of troops available for other missions. Troops returning from the Golan will need many months of retraining to regain the warfighting skills that atrophied during their peacekeeping deployment.<sup>5</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American Golan peacekeeping commitment also would entail considerable financial costs, and could drain away hundreds of millions of dollars from the defense budget. Congress already has scaled back the U.S. contribution to the Sinai MFO budget, cutting it from $80 million to $74 million in fiscal year 1988. Similar budgetary pressures could undercut a Golan MFO, even if other nations contribute to the costs of the operation.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>REASON #5:</b>  Americans are not needed. If peacekeepers are needed to monitor a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty, they should not be Americans. An American peacekeeping presence would be a lightning rod for terrorism, would drain the U.S. defense budget unnecessarily, and would strain Israeli-American relations. Other countries are willing and fully able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces. After all, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force has deployed peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to blocking an American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights, Congress should press the Clinton Administration to:
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Rule out foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. To make it clear that no U.S. aid will be forthcoming to sweeten a Syrian-Israeli deal, Congress should pass a resolution opposing U.S. foreign aid to Syria. The reward for peace is peace, not billions of dollars of bribery. America's aid to Egypt, a country which did not launch terrorist attacks against Americans, came after the 1978 Camp David accords and in the context of the Cold War. Egypt switched sides and left the Soviet orbit to become a reliable American ally. Syria has no Soviet card to play. The U.S. must allocate its increasingly scarce foreign aid resources to long-term friends and not use foreign aid as a reward to Syria, a long-standing adversary. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Maintain pressure on Syria to halt its support of terrorism. Damascus supports over one dozen terrorist groups, including many Palestinian groups opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The U.S. should push Syria relentlessly to expel these Palestinians from Syrian territory and Syrian-controlled Lebanese territory, crack down on Hezbollah in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon, and cooperate with the U.S. in breaking the back of international terrorist groups. There can be no genuine peace as long as Syria maintains ties with terrorists. Congress should ensure that the war against terrorism remains a high priority of U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, Syria should not be removed from the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism unless Damascus halts its support for terrorism. Syria should not be removed from the list merely as a reward for signing a peace treaty with Israel.
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American peacekeeping presence on the Golan Heights is not needed. It would not significantly reduce the military risks that Israel would run in returning the Golan to Syrian control. The U.S. cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit. Nor should it seek to downplay the significant military risks attendant on returning the Golan Heights to Syria. If Israel decides to do so, that is its prerogative, but it should do so without the implied commitment represented by a U.S. tripwire on the Golan. There are many other nations that would be willing to provide peacekeeping forces, if that is necessary.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress must open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another <i>fait accompli</i> like Haiti or Bosnia. Now that Secretary of Defense Perry has confirmed that a U.S. commitment of some sort exists, it can no longer be deemed "premature" for Congress to discuss the issue.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The bottom line:  Syria gets more out of a peace agreement with Israel than does the U.S. and therefore should be willing to pay more for it. Washington should push Assad to acquiesce to America's agenda and not get bogged down in more narrow peace negotiating issues. The U.S. must not jeopardize important national interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic.

<h3>A Tale of Two Pesos:  A Comparison of Currency Policies In Mexico and Argentina</h3>




<b>By Steve H. Hanke<sup>1</sup></b><br>Delivered December 12, 1995<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A sound currency is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the establishment of a stable government and the promotion of economic prosperity. This theme has been sounded over and over again by virtually all great economists in positions of influence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After suffering the trauma of the 1922-1923 hyperinflation, no people has taken the call for sound currency and credit systems more to heart than the Germans. As West Germany's first Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, put it:  "Safeguarding the currency forms the prime condition for maintaining a market economy and, ultimately, a free constitution for society and the state" (Marsh, 1992, p. 30). Not surprisingly, Adenauer's economics minister, Ludwig Erhard, went so far as to proclaim that monetary stability was a basic human right. These sentiments are shared by all political parties in Germany. Indeed, one of the pithiest pronouncements on the need for sound money was uttered in parliamentary debate by Karl Schiller, the Social Democratic economics minister from 1966 to 1972:  "Stability is not everything, but without stability, everything is nothing" (Marsh, 1992, p. 30).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The German views on sound money are enshrined in the Bundesbank Law of 1957. That law charges the central bank with one and only one objective:  to defend the value of the German mark. And that is just what the Bundesbank does. Indeed, in the post-Bretton Woods era, the mighty mark has been the world's most stable currency (Deane and Pringle, 1994, pp. 353-354). This performance is, of course, music to the ears of most Germans:  a recent poll found that almost 80 percent of the Germans identify their Germanness with the stability, strength, and international prestige of the mark (Nash, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After bearing the burden of one of the world's most unstable currencies for decades, Argentineans appear to be following the path of the Germans (Hanke, 1995). In Argentina's most recent presidential election, all three major parties (which accounted for 96.2 percent of the popular vote) supported Argentina's Convertibility Law (Law 23.928). Under this law, which has governed monetary policy since April 1, 1991, the Argentine peso is fully backed by U.S. dollar denominated assets and is freely convertible at an absolutely fixed exchange rate of one peso for one dollar.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In contrast, Mexico's monetary policy is in disarray. Although Mexicans yearn for a sound peso, politicians from the three major parties and the technocrats who advise them have not been able to agree on a well defined exchange rate policy. The Banco de Mexico has allowed the peso to collapse during the last four presidential election periods and consequently has the distinction of being one the world's worst central banks (101st out of 108), judged on the basis of currency stability (Deane and Pringle, 1994, pp. 353-354). Given this, it is not surprising that the Banco has been unable to establish a transparent exchange rate policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Banco de Mexico's monetary policy remains incoherent. Indeed, the numbers contained in the Banco's monetary plan for 1996 are not plausible. The Banco assumes that real GDP and inflation will increase by 3 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively, and that the monetary base will increase by 28.6 percent during 1996. This implies that the demand for pesos will dramatically increase and that the velocity of money will dramatically decline to    -5 percent. Given the historical record in Mexico, this is highly unlikely (I.D.E. A. and the London School of Economics, 1995). Indeed, for velocity to decline to -5 percent, inflation would have to decline from 53 percent in 1995 to around 20 percent in 1996, and more important, such a drop in inflation and a stable exchange rate would have to be the prevailing expectation. Such a shift in expectations is highly unlikely, particularly given the central bank's low level of credibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, it is important to mention that Mexico -- unlike Argentina and Chile, for example -- has also failed to produce a coherent program to cut public spending and to privatize and deregulate its economy. As the <i>Economist</i> magazine put in its recent  <i>Survey of Mexico</i>, "much of the economic liberalization of recent years has not been up to scratch. Privatization sometimes merely served to replace public monopolies with private ones -- amid much scattering of lucrative favors....  [And] financial reform was late and poorly regulated."  (<i>Economist</i>, October 28, 1995, p. 15). If this is not bad enough, Mexico continues to embrace the principle of wage-price controls. This principle was enshrined in October 1995, with the approval of yet another pact, the Alliance for Economic Recuperation (DePalma, October 30, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An incoherent monetary policy and half-baked economic liberalization are hardly the foundation upon which to build stability and robust economic growth. Indeed, this combination of policies is a recipe for continued financial and political turmoil in Mexico.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To avoid future turmoil, Mexico must correctly define its exchange rate regime. Exchange rate regimes come in three varieties:  pegged (fixed, but adjustable), floating, and fixed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Pegged exchange rates are favored by most developing countries. Some developed countries, most notably those that are members of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, also employ pegged exchange rates. This regime is not a free-market mechanism for international payments. It is an interventionist system, and should be rejected on principle.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In practice, pegged exchange rate regimes, not surprisingly, do not perform well. They require central banks to manage simultaneously a currency's exchange rate, the domestic liquidity, and the capital account. This is a tricky, if not impossible, task, particularly in developing countries, where the instruments for discretionary monetary policies are limited (Fry, 1995). Consequently, a pegged rate inevitably results in contradictory policies that invite a speculative attack. When under siege, a peg cannot last unless interest rates are raised to sky-high levels or foreign exchange controls are imposed. Alas, such episodes usually get out of hand and result in an "adjustment" to the peg (a devaluation).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is what happened with Mexico's old pegged system in which the peso was linked to the U.S. dollar. Under that peg, the peso was allowed to trade within a tolerance band of some plus or minus 3 percent. The band "crawled" downward daily, allowing an annual peso depreciation of about 4 percent against the dollar.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To keep the peso within this band, the Mexican central bank had to manage at the same time both the peso-dollar exchange rate and the peso money supply. This is a difficult balancing act, as Mexico discovered in 1994, and as members of the ERM discovered in 1992 and 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Interestingly, Lord Keynes anticipated the difficulties posed by pegged systems. As he put it in 1923, "we cannot keep both our own price level and our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose" (Keynes, 1971, p. 126). Alas, despite the evidence, advocates of pegged exchange rates are alive and well. Indeed, some research institutions, notably the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., are evangelical in their promotion of pegged systems (Bergston and Williamson, 1983).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To put the failure of pegged exchange rates into a broader context -- particularly in developing countries, where they are almost universally used -- consider the performance of central banks in developing countries since 1971, when the U.S. closed the gold window (Schuler, 1995). The median annual rate of inflation of the 126 developing countries with central banks has been double that of the 19 developed countries. And 37 developing countries have experienced annual inflation from 100 percent to 999 percent, and 19 have endured hyperinflation of over 1,000 percent per year. In the same period, 13 developing countries have confiscated their currencies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, the currencies of the developing countries have lost most of their value relative to the U.S. dollar. The median depreciation has been 79 percent since 1970. And if you reside in a developing country, it is difficult to legally avoid the effects of currency depreciation because 88 percent of those countries impose some form of exchange controls.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And here's the saddest part:  The low-quality junk money produced by the central banks in developing countries has been a drag on per capita economic growth. Since 1971, the developed countries have grown at almost twice the rate of the developing nations,
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In an attempt to avoid being robbed by their central banks, citizens in developing countries resort to all means, legal or illegal, to get their hands on "high-quality" money. Consequently, Gresham's Law in reverse is at work in most of the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As much as some might complain about the U.S. dollar, the greenback is the world's preferred currency, with the German mark coming in a distant second. Indeed, between $185 billion and $260 billion in cash is held outside the U.S. -- 50 percent to 70 percent of the total U.S. dollar notes outstanding (Blinder, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Where have all the greenbacks gone?  Between 1988-1991, most went to Latin America. Since then, Europe has been the dominant destination, with Russia demanding the lion's share. In 1994 well over half of the total foreign shipments of dollars went to Russia, a total of about $20 billion. The rate of shipments to Russia has increased in 1995, with flows running at a remarkable $100 million per business day. After Europe, the Far East and Middle East now account for about 30 percent of the shipments, and the remainder of the dollars flow to Latin America (Porter and Judson, 1995). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The export of greenbacks is a very profitable business for the U.S. No other export can match the profit margins earned by the Federal Reserve's shipments of cash overseas. The Fed prints and hands over little pieces of noninterest-bearing green paper at almost no cost and gets hard currency in exchange. This amounts to an interest-free loan from foreign holders of those pieces of green paper. The Fed then invests the proceeds in U.S. government securities and turns the profits over to the U.S. Treasury.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The profits are huge, between $11 billion to $15 billion per year -- equal to federal receipts from estate and gift taxes. Moreover, it is a growing business:  Foreign holdings of U.S. dollars are growing faster than the U.S. economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unlike pegged exchange rates, floating and fixed rates are free-market mechanisms for international payments. Under a floating regime -- such as that which governs the U.S. dollar, German mark, and Japanese yen -- a national currency seeks its own level in relation to other currencies that it floats against. Although many currencies in developed countries float, few of the developing countries float their currencies, and for those that do float, it tends to be a short-lived experiment (Schuler, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though there is nothing wrong with floating, in principle, this type of regime is plagued with practical problems in developing countries, where most central banks have very poor records and lack credibility. Consequently, to achieve price stability under a floating regime, a central bank must impose a relatively restrictive monetary policy and relatively high real interest rates for an extended period. Alas, this would be accompanied by an economic slump or very slow economic growth. This is why few developing countries have adopted floating rates. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fixed exchange rates are favored by a handful of countries -- most notably, Argentina, Estonia, Hong Kong, and Lithuania. These countries employ currency board-like systems in which their local currencies are backed 100 percent by a reserve currency and are freely convertible into the reserve currency at an absolutely fixed exchange rate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consequently, a country operating under this discipline forgoes an independent monetary policy and becomes part of a unified currency area with the country to which its local currency is linked. Unlike floating regimes, currency boards have a rich and successful history in developing countries (Hanke, Jonung, and Schuler, 1993).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More than 70 countries have had currency boards. The first currency board was established in 1849 in the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, then a British colony. Currency boards spread to other British colonies and to independent countries that wanted to earn income from having their own currencies, yet maintain fixed exchange rates with an anchor currency. Most currency boards used the pound sterling as their anchor currency, but some used the U.S. dollar, the Australian pound, gold, or silver.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beginning about 1913, the currency board system spread rapidly, and eventually it reached almost all parts of the world. Currency boards were common in Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, the Caribbean, and Oceania. In South America, Argentina had a currency board. In 1899 Argentina passed a law re-establishing the gold standard and requiring the Caja de Conversión, previously a conduit for unbacked paper money, to hold 100 percent gold reserves for all new liabilities. The system became fully operative in 1902. The period of its operation was one of great prosperity for Argentina, which at the time was among the world's richest countries. Argentina suspended the system just after the First World War began, apparently because the government feared a drain of gold to countries that had already suspended the gold standard. Argentina re-established a currency board briefly from 1927 to 1929, but suspended it again in December 1929, as a result of the worldwide stock-market crash and the resulting cessation of foreign investment in Argentina. Both in 1914 and 1929, the gold reserves of the Caja and commercial banks were high, and the rationale for suspending the system appears dubious in retrospect (Hanke, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The performance of currency boards through out the world has been excellent. All have maintained full convertibility into their anchor currencies. Furthermore, countries with boards have generally had price stability, respectable economic growth, and balanced government budgets. (Hanke and Schuler, 1994).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What type of exchange rate regime should Mexico adopt?  A pegged system should be rejected on two counts:  it is unsound in principle, and in practice, pegged regimes have a poor record, particularly in Mexico. A floating regime, though sound in principle, is unsatisfactory for developing countries with central banks that have low credibility, such as is the case in Mexico. Alas, many free-market economists have recommended that Mexico float the peso. Two notable examples are Dr. W. Lee Hoskins and Professor Allan H. Meltzer (Hoskins and Coons, 1995 and Meltzer, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Apparently, these free-market economists have failed to pay heed to Professor R.H. Coase and his complaints about economists who engage in abstract theorizing to the neglect of acquiring a detailed knowledge of the actual institutions involved (in this case, central banks in developing countries). This, of course, is not the first time this type of error has been committed in debates about exchange rate regimes (Hutchinson, 1977).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both on principle and in practical terms, a currency board for Mexico offers the most attractive exchange rate regime. Sir Alan Walters and I first argued in favor of this approach in July 1994 (Hanke and Walters, 1994). Specifically, we concluded that the peso was overvalued and that Mexico's crawling peg system would fall apart. We recommended that the peso should be devalued by 16 percent, to 4 pesos per U.S. dollar, and that a currency board system should be installed. By introducing a completely new and credible exchange rate regime, inflation expectations would have been dramatically altered in Mexico and the new exchange rate would have remained absolutely fixed at 4 pesos per U.S. dollar from that point onward. Hence, we are not "airy-fairy" devaluationists, as Sir Roy Harrod has called them (Hutchinson, 1977, p. 101).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, we are not the only free-market economists who see currency boards as the only means to achieve monetary stability in developing countries. Professor Milton Friedman, never one to overlook real world institutional detail, has written that:
<p><blockquote>
	[F]or developing countries, the case against using monetary policy primarily as an instrument for short-run stabilization is far stronger than for developed countries. The crucial problem for developing countries is to achieve sustained growth, not to smooth short-run fluctuations. In addition, such countries seldom have financial markets and banking institutions sufficiently sophisticated to permit what has come (most inaccurately) to be called "fine-tuning" of monetary policy.
<p>
	...  [F]or most such countries, I believe the best policy would be to eschew the revenue from money creation, to unify their currency with the currency of a large, relatively stable, developed country with which they have close economic relations, and to impose no barriers to the movement of money or of prices, wages, or interest rates. Such a policy requires avoiding a central bank. (Friedman, 1974, p. 274).
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So why has Mexico eschewed a currency board?  Many hypothetical objections have been raised. Most of these have been presented in a recent book (Williamson, 1995). And all have been refuted (Hanke and Schuler, 1994). But, the Mexican technocrats, unable to mount a substantive attack on the currency board system, turned to a practical argument. They claimed that Mexico did not have enough reserves to fully back the Banco de Mexico's liabilities (Buira, 1995). Even if this was true, it is irrelevant. A viable currency board can be started with less than 100 percent reserves on existing, old liabilities, if all new liabilities are required to have 100 percent reserve backing. In the past, this type of marginal reserve rule has been successfully employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, while the fiat issue of pesos that Argentina's currency board inherited in 1902 was virtually unbacked by gold (which served as the reserve cover), new pesos could only be issued if they were backed 100 percent by gold reserves. Once the new system was installed, the demand for new pesos grew rapidly. Consequently, the gold cover for all outstanding pesos rose from only 0.11 percent in 1902 to almost 73 percent in 1913 (Hanke, 1995).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This leaves us with two unanswered questions:  How well did the Argentine currency board-like system stand up to the ravages of the so-called tequila effect?  And what lessons can Mexico draw from Argentina's experience?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The shock imposed on Argentina by Mexico's financial crisis had four distinct phases (Banco Central, Republic of Argentina, 1995). The first phase lasted from December 20, 1994 through February 1995. External drains from the currency board-like system occurred, with the central bank's liquid reserves falling from $15.8 billion before the crisis to $13.3 billion at the end of February. (Note that Argentina's system is not orthodox because only 80 percent of the system's reserves must be held in dollar denominated assets issued by foreign governments. These are called "liquid reserves."  The remaining reserves must be dollar denominated, but can be issued by the Republic of Argentina. Both types of reserves must be marked-to-market (valued) at current prices.) There were also internal drains of both peso and dollar deposits from commercial banks. Wholesale banks and small retail banks were most strongly affected. Two small wholesale banks, with a high proportion of their assets in Argentine government bonds, were suspended.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During the first phase, the broad money supply, M3 (pesos outside banks plus peso and dollar deposits), decreased by 3.2 billion pesos, or 5.8 percent, by the end of February. And bond prices fell sharply, with yields on peso denominated bonds moving from 22.6 percent before the crisis to 38.9 percent at the end of February. The prime rate on peso denominated loans also increased during the period, from 12.5 percent to 22.7 percent. Dollar denominated bond yields and the dollar prime rate also increased, but not by as much as those on comparable peso denominated instruments. The peso-dollar bond yields, for example, increased from 480 basis points to 934 basis points (Pre 1 vs. Pre 2 bonds), reflecting an increase in the perceived exchange rate risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The central bank took steps to tighten the link between the peso and the dollar. On January 12th, it eliminated the spread between buying and selling rates for dollars, making the rate exactly 1 peso = $1. It also required banks to hold their current accounts at the central bank in dollars instead of pesos (these accounts are used for clearing and reserve requirements). That reduced the central bank's potential gain from a devaluation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To increase the liquidity of banks, the central bank temporarily reduced reserve requirements on deposits on the 28th of December and again the 12th of January. On January 12th, it also established a safety net (lender of last resort facility) financed with 2 percentage points of existing required reserves. These funds could be loaned to solvent banks with liquidity problems. Previously, there had been a private, voluntary safety net to buy loans from banks with temporary liquidity problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Subsequently, the government took further action to assure bank liquidity. Decree 286 of February 27th created the Fiduciary Fund for Provincial Development to help privatize banks owned by provincial governments, many of which were notoriously weak. Decree 290 of February 27th amended the Organic Law of the central bank to broaden its power to lend to illiquid banks, and amended the Law of Financial Institutions to allow the central bank to play a more active part in reorganizing troubled institutions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The liquidity squeeze that the financial system had endured became a true crisis in the second, post-tequila phase, which started in late February 1995 and lasted through March. On February 27th, the international banks with branches in Argentina cut off credit lines to their branch operations, citing "country risk" as the rationale for such drastic action. This shocked branch bank managers and sent them scurrying unprepared into the domestic interbank market. The consequences were predictable. The interbank interest rates rose dramatically, from about 20 percent on peso deposits to over 50 percent within hours after the international credit lines were cut. Also, the massive entry of the international branch banks into the interbank market was interpreted as a vote of no confidence for Argentina's currency board-like system. Consequently, both external drains from the currency board-like system and internal drains from the commercial banks became great floods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is important to stress that the withdrawal of the credit lines from the international banks was the event that pushed Argentina from a liquidity squeeze into a liquidity crisis. Viewed from a historical perspective, this event is unusual, if not unique. With absolutely fixed exchange rate regimes, either currency boards or the classical gold standard (1880-1914), foreign banks have provided liquidity during times of liquidity squeezes (Hanke, Jonung, and Schuler, 1993; Gallarotti, 1995). Indeed, private foreign banks have traditionally acted as lenders of last resort in absolutely fixed exchange rate systems. This was not the case in Argentina, because its currency board-like system was relatively immature and untested. Alas, Argentina had to pay a price for the sins of its monetary past.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fuel was added to the crisis, when in the last days of February, rumors spread that the government might freeze deposits, as it had done with the "Bonex plan" of early 1990. Many people were also apprehensive that the decrees of February 27th were a prelude to broader powers that would reduce the rule-bound nature of the currency board-like system. There was also fear that a possible devaluation in Brazil would have effects in Argentina.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In March, the broad money supply fell by 4.3 billion pesos, or 8.4 percent; it reached its low point for the crisis at the end of the month. Peso deposits, dollar deposits, and currency outside banks all fell, reflecting a desire by many Argentines to hold their money outside the local financial system, either in dollar deposits abroad or dollar caches locally. Interest rates jumped; the peso prime rate increased from 28 percent at the end of February and peaked at 45 percent in March. Dollar interest rates likewise increased, with the prime rate peaking at 30 percent. The exchange rate risk exploded, with the peso-dollar interest rate spread moving from 934 basis points at the end of February to 1,647 basis points at its peak. Since dollar interest rates were many times those prevailing in the United States, market participants evidently perceived that there was a high risk that borrowers of dollars would default or that the Argentine government would interfere with loans and deposits in dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the crisis worsening, the central bank took additional measures to further increase liquidity for banks. On March 10th it temporarily allowed all banks to use up to 50 percent of their peso and dollar vault cash to fulfill reserve requirements, and allowed banks that had bought assets from institutions with liquidity problems to use the remaining 50 percent in the same way. The central bank also used its excess reserves to make short-term loans (discounts and repos) exceeding 900 million pesos to solvent banks with liquidity problems. As a result of its loans and the reduction in pesos outside banks, the central bank's liquid reserves fell to a low of 10.2 billion pesos at the end of March, compared with 15.8 billion pesos in late December. However, at no time during the crisis did the ratio of liquid reserves to the monetary base fall below the statutory minimum of 80 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On March 14th, the government announced a package of measures, totaling 11.4 billion pesos, to contain the financial crisis. It accelerated privatizations. It reduced its planned government spending by 2 billion pesos, including cutting the wages of senior government employees by 5 percent to 15 percent. It increased several taxes, most important the value-added tax (a temporary increase of the rate, lasting until March 31, 1996, from 18 percent to 21 percent). And it announced plans to borrow up to US$7 billion -- a three-year US$l billion domestic "patriotic" bond issue from Argentines, a three-year US$l billion bond issue from private foreign lenders and US$5 billion from the IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Argentina's success in putting together the (oversubscribed) $1 billion Patriotic Loan turned the corner. The loan was a convincing domestic affirmation of the creditworthiness of the Menem-Cavallo administration, and the IMF et al. tagged along. This soon opened up the system with a fall in interest rates as dramatic as the February-March rise. The crisis was over.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the beginning of April to the presidential election of May 14th, phase three, the crisis leveled off in some respects and eased in others. The broad money supply remained approximately constant:  dollar deposits decreased, while peso deposits and pesos outside banks actually increased. Interest rates declined slightly; the peso prime rate eased from about 27 percent at the beginning of April to 24.5 percent in mid-May. Perceived exchange rate risk also declined, with the peso-dollar spread narrowing from 1,224 basis points at the beginning of April to 713 basis points in mid-May. And on April 12th, the government announced the creation of a privately financed, voluntary Deposit Guarantee Fund for peso and dollar deposits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite the crisis, the Convertibility Law continued to enjoy support across the political spectrum, including the three leading candidates and parties in the presidential election. Nonetheless, people were apprehensive about what might happen if President Menem were defeated or forced into a runoff election. However, President Menem's re-election in the first round, and the strong showing of his Justicialist Party in Congress, calmed the fears that a change in the government would undermine the Convertibility Law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After the presidential election, all monetary indicators improved, marking the last phase the crisis, which ended by the beginning of August. Interest rates fell; the peso prime rate fell from 24.5 percent in mid-May to 14.5 percent by late July, while the dollar prime rate fell from about 18.5 percent to 12 percent in the same period. The broad money supply increased, though by the end of July it was still about 10 percent below the pre-crisis level. Pesos outside banks, peso deposits, and dollar deposits all registered increases. Bank credit to households and businesses, which had fallen about 4 percent from the beginning of the crisis to the low point at the end of April, began to recover. Further, the central bank reduced its repos by about half between the end of March and the end of July, while its liquid reserves held against the monetary base rose above 90 percent. The perceived exchange rate risk also eased, with the peso-dollar spread narrowing from 713 basis points at the beginning of phase three to 500 basis points at the end of July.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the present, the Argentine monetary indicators roughly reflect the "pre-tequila" magnitudes. The peso-dollar exchange rate remains absolutely fixed at 1 to 1. And inflation for 1995 was 1.6 percent, one of the lowest rates in the world and the lowest annual inflation in Argentina since 1944. The central bank's liquid reserves increased by $3 billion during December 1995, to reach $15 billion, almost the pre-tequila level of $15.8 billion. Dollar denominated time deposits currently stand $500 million higher than those of December 1994, and M1 has returned to its December 1994 level. And the peso and dollar prime interest rates are 9.5 percent and 8.25 percent, respectively. Both rates are lower than their pre-tequila levels. The perceived exchange rate risk is actually lower than the pre-crisis level, with the peso-dollar spread currently standing at 359 basis points, 121 basis points lower than the pre-crisis spread. Like tempered steel, Argentina's currency board-like system has been toughened by the crisis, and as the peso-dollar spread indicates, the system is stronger than ever. In addition, unemployment has started to come down and economic activity is starting to show signs of life. So, Argentina's currency board-like system has proven its critics, such as Professor Krugman, wrong (Krugman, 1995). As the Duke of Wellington often observed victory is the avoidance of being crushed by an onslaught, and Argentina's currency board-like system has certainly kept Argentina from being crushed by the tequila effect.
<p>
<b>What lessons can Mexico draw from the Argentine experience?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Currency boards, much like the classical gold standard, provide a constraint on monetary authorities. This is not to say that the monetary authorities do not attempt to maneuver around the constraints. Indeed, writing about the gold standard in 1932, Professor F. A. Hayek concluded that "Every effort has been made to obviate [the gold standard's] functioning at any point at which there was dissatisfaction with the tendencies which were being revealed by it" (Hayek, 1984, p. 134). During Argentina's recent experience, the authorities also squirmed as much as they could within the confines of Argentina's currency board-like system. However, as much as the monetary authorities tried to maneuver and introduce discretion into Argentina's rule-bound, absolutely fixed rate system, they failed to shake its irksome constraints (Gallarotti, 1995 and Hayek, 1984). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consequently, currency boards create price stability, even in times of severe crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The hard budget constraints imposed by currency boards motivate deeper liberal economic reforms, as well as desired automatic adjustments in the economy. For example, before the Mexican crisis, Argentina's banking system was notoriously weak. Given that Argentina had no central bank that could print pesos at will or act liberally as a lender of last resort, many people thought that the weak banking system would be Argentina's Achilles' heel. It was not and is not. Argentina's banking system is rapidly being strengthened and consolidated, with a few weak banks going to the wall and many more being bought by strong banks. Now, 80 percent of all Argentinean deposits are in the 25 largest banks. In addition, virtually all the weak banks owned by the provinces are on the block in a mass privatization. The discipline imposed by the currency board has put in place a virtuous cycle. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; And perhaps most important, the results produced by currency board systems can give politicians a platform from which they can win elections.
If Mexico wants to clean up its monetary mess, it must ponder the lessons provided by the Argentine experience. By facing reality, even Mexico's braying pack of technocrats might finally appreciate that a currency board system is the only way for Mexico to provide Mexicans with what they yearn for:  a stable peso.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since the Cold War ended, the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization has been in the midst of an identity crisis. When it lost the Soviet threat in the early 
1990s, the Atlantic alliance went on a search to redefine itself. There have been many stops on this 
inchoate journey of redefinition. The Bush Administration used NATO forces, structure, and 
modus operandi to build a framework for the coalition that defeated Saddam Hussein in the Persian 
Gulf War. Since President Clinton took office, NATO has gone in even more directions. Between 
1993 and 1995, NATO acted as a combat subcontractor for the United Nations in the former 
Yugoslavia, implementing and enforcing a "no-fly zone" over Bosnia and providing close air 
support to U.N. peacekeepers. Now, of course, NATO is involved in an ambitious peace 
enforcement operation in Bosnia:  a mission for which NATO was not originally designed and in a 
country that is not a member of the Atlantic alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has traveled far from its original mission of 
deterring a Soviet attack on Western Europe. It stands to reason that it should do so, NATO 
planners maintain, because the original raison d'etre of the alliance -- the Soviet threat -- has 
disappeared. What is needed, they argue, is to make NATO more up-to-date and more relevant to 
solving messy conflicts like Bosnia. Peacekeeping and "out-of-area" military operations (whereby 
NATO becomes involved in conflicts outside the treaty area) are supposed to save NATO from 
irrelevance. Unless NATO adapts to new circumstances, they aver, it will wither away and become 
extinct.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These advocates of a trendier NATO have it backwards. 
Unless NATO returns to its core mission, it will not survive. That mission is to preserve the 
freedom and security of Europe as a whole -- to prevent the general conflagration of Europe -- and 
not to put out every brushfire that breaks out in every corner of the continent. Put in the parlance of 
the strategist, NATO's core mission is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or 
bloc of powers which strive to deny the continent of its overall freedom and security.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That mission -- preserving the basic security condition of 
Europe -- is as relevant today as it was during the Cold War. Moreover, it is especially important in 
defining the American role in European security and NATO. The U.S. has a vital interest in the 
freedom and security of Europe regardless of whether a hostile attack is imminent. Who is to say 
whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe ten or twenty years 
from now?  It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest 
in the basic security condition of Europe. If even a potential threat to that interest exists, the U.S. 
must be prepared to deter major power aggression and defend European security and freedom. It 
makes no sense for America to leave Europe and return, as it did in the last two world wars, only 
when Europe is in flames and the threat is practically on America's doorstep. It is far better to keep 
100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send 1 million GIs to fight a European war 
that broke out in America's absence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The more NATO drifts away from this core mission, the 
less likely it will survive in the long run. It will not work to create new roles and missions for which 
the alliance is poorly suited and in which the U.S. is reluctant to become involved. Military make-
work will cause the interests of alliance members to diverge and will accelerate the demise of the 
alliance. If peacekeeping and other crisis management operations take NATO too far afield of its 
core mission, the cohesion of the alliance will be diluted and the U.S. will lose interest over time. 
Getting NATO involved in "out-of-area" operations for their own sake will not do the trick either. 
Having a baby to save the marriage is neither good family practice nor a sound basis for military 
strategy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. It needs to refocus on 
its core mission of ensuring that peace and freedom in Europe as a whole are not threatened by a 
hostile power. The greatest threat to NATO's cohesion today is the possibility of failure in 
Bosnia.<sup>1 </sup>  No other issue has such a potential to tear NATO apart -- not the debate over 
NATO enlargement or disagreements about how to handle the Russians. If NATO trips up today, it 
will not be over a disagreement concerning its core mission, but over some tangential but 
seemingly urgent problem (like Bosnia) which Europeans and Americans mistook as being 
fundamentally and strategically important to the security and freedom of Europe as a whole.
<p>
<b>Why NATO? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO countries need to explain to their peoples why 
NATO is needed regardless of what happens in Bosnia. American leaders in particular need not 
only to articulate more clearly to a skeptical public why NATO should exist, but also to establish 
clearer principles for when the U.S. should or should not become involved in Europe's wars. In 
addition, leaders should make an effort to define how America will become involved in other 
European security affairs. This will promote a clearer and more sensible division of labor that can 
be understood by Americans and Europeans. Accomplishing these tasks would give NATO 
direction and purpose. There are three reasons why NATO should exist. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. This is vitally important to the freedom and security 
of the United States. A Europe dominated by any power hostile to America, her interests, and her 
values would be a direct threat to the security, stability, and prosperity of the United States itself. 
America fought two world wars and sustained over 40 years of a Cold War military commitment to 
prevent Europe's domination. It should be no less committed to this goal today, even though the 
immediacy of the threat has diminished.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is a strategic insurance policy. Insurance exists to 
protect against catastrophe, no matter how remote the threat may be. Because the cost of 
catastrophe is so high, people are willing to pay insurance premiums to protect them in case it 
strikes. Even when the likelihood of a household fire is remote, most people still take out fire 
insurance because the cost of a fire is so devastating, and far greater than the cost of the premiums.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So it is with NATO. The threat today in Europe is not as 
great as it once was, but neither are the premiums. One hundred thousand troops deployed in 
Europe today is far more economical, both in blood and treasure, than the cost a world war would 
impose on America tomorrow. Twice this century, Americans have seen what happens when fire 
sweeps over Europe. Anything that would prevent such a catastrophe would be well worth the 
price. Indeed, for this reason, NATO is even better than insurance. It actually helps to prevent 
catastrophe. That makes it a double bargain. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A major 
power threat to Europe would cause economic disruption that would be devastating to U.S. markets 
and economic stability. The U.S. economy is greatly dependent on the economic stability of 
America's principal trading partners, and access to trade and resources in Europe is a vital 
American interest. Europe is America's second largest trading region and accounts for billions of 
dollars in two-way trade per year. Many millions of jobs in the United States are directly dependent 
upon American trade with Europe and European investment in the U.S. The prosperity of America 
depends in large measure on a free and prosperous Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. While NATO ultimately is an 
alliance of collective defense, it also is a functional vehicle for promoting democracy and freedom 
in Europe. It is not only practically important from the standpoint of providing stability in Europe, 
but it has a moral component as well. NATO is an organization of democratic states and a reflection 
of America's identity in the world, an anchor for American values both abroad and at home. This 
stability, born of political freedom and economic prosperity, should be brought by NATO to 
Central Europe, a region historically characterized by political instability.
<P>
<b>When Should America Become Involved? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; It is not enough to know that America should remain in 
the NATO alliance. The far more pressing problem is to know when and under what circumstances 
U.S. combat troops should or should not become involved in a range of military operations in 
Europe. In order to have a coherent strategy and promote a sensible division of labor in Europe, the 
U.S. should adhere to some basic guidelines. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. The main mission of the U.S. armed forces in 
Europe should be to prevent Europe from falling victim to a hostile hegemonic power. Thus, 
America's main military mission is collective defense -- to protect NATO member states from a 
major power threat. While the U.S. should never rule out participation in less threatening scenarios 
or turn its back on out-of-area operations, in general it should concentrate its military efforts on 
achieving NATO's core military mission. This will lend definition and purpose to NATO and the 
American role.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. As a rule, if U.S. forces duplicate the efforts of European 
allies that can provide the same capabilities, the European forces should get the nod. The United 
States is NATO's military leader because of its unique and powerful military capabilities. It is not 
just another European military power; it is a world power with many strategic commitments. A 
significant U.S. military role in NATO must be guided by the singular capabilities that America can 
bring to bear.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The use of large numbers of American combat forces should make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. If the American people perceive an American-led NATO 
chasing peripheral security crises with the reluctant participation of prosperous European allies, 
public support for NATO will erode quickly. The U.S. military role in NATO must be a unique and 
decisive contribution towards the core mission of the alliance.
<p>
<b>Enlarging NATO. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Expanding the Atlantic alliance to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would enhance NATO's capability to perform its core 
mission of defending the basic security condition of Europe. The profound geopolitical security and 
stability this will bring to Central Europe far outweighs the technical and financial difficulties of 
limited enlargement. To do this, the Clinton Administration must stop dragging its feet. Clinton has 
taken the exclusive counsel of his fears and has given too much weight to complaints from 
Russians who oppose NATO enlargement. The President has given Russia a <i>de facto</i> veto 
and has used the Partnership for Peace plan as little more than a bureaucratic delaying tactic. 
Clinton needs to act now by making a political commitment to these four Central European states 
and demonstrating the same kind of vision and courage that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
President George Bush showed in pressing for German unification in the face of Soviet opposition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act. To spur the President to 
revitalize NATO, the Congress needs to act. The Clinton Administration has not done a good job of 
giving NATO a sense of purpose and mission in the post-Cold War era. The Congress should 
consider passing a NATO Revitalization Act that not only spells out the reasons for the American 
people about why the U.S. should be involved in NATO, but also clearly defines the strategic role 
of the U.S. in fulfilling NATO's core mission of collective defense. This Act also should define the 
principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, thereby urging the Europeans to take 
more responsibility for peacekeeping and other marginal military missions. Finally, it should call 
expressly for the rapid inclusion of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in NATO 
and substantial modification of the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program.
<p>


<b>NATO'S IDENTITY CRISIS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has proven to be 
the most effective security alliance of modern times. Its stated aim was to "safeguard the freedom, 
common heritage and civilization of [its] peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, 
individual liberty and the rule of law."  The treaty signatories also sought to "promote stability and 
well-being in the North Atlantic area" and were "resolved to unite their efforts for collective 
defense and for the preservation of peace and security."<sup>2 </sup>  That NATO achieved these 
goals with small loss of life in the face of an adversarial and expansionist Soviet Union was truly 
remarkable. Underpinning this success story was the enormous and expensive political and military 
commitment made by America to NATO, a commitment that did not waver during the many crises 
of the Cold War.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is the ironic fate of alliances that their success ultimately 
can spell the end of their existence. Such is the case with NATO, where the moment of the 
alliance's greatest triumph contained within it the seeds of the identity crisis that now threatens its 
viability and even its existence. The demise of the Soviet Union brought calls for a "peace 
dividend" the world over. Politicians and strategists proposed a restructuring of alliance 
commitments, defense requirements, and security architecture to meet the more unpredictable but 
less apocalyptic threats of the new world disorder. The American public demanded that its 
politicians focus on troubles at home. The 1992 presidential campaign was about "the economy, 
stupid," and foreign policy issues dropped out of the immediate consciousness of 
America.<sup> 3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the meantime, NATO has struggled for a post-Soviet 
identity that can inspire its members to remain completely committed. It is still not clear that this 
can be accomplished in the absence of a clear and present danger that would cause the interests of 
all NATO members to converge. Consequently, the struggle to find a new identity for the alliance 
has been marked by an inchoate and inclusive program of NATO enlargement (further muddled by 
the Partnership for Peace program), a dabbling in combat support to U.N. peacekeeping, a proposal 
to refocus NATO on the Mediterranean and the implicit threat of nationalist Islam, and the out-of-
area peace enforcement operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;None of these operations has served to inspire solid 
support for NATO from the American public and Congress. While a majority of Americans (56 
percent) support America's basic commitment to the alliance, public support for the American role 
in NATO's Bosnian intervention has peaked at around 40 percent.<sup>4 </sup>  In addition, while 
support for NATO is stable in Congress, the Bosnian mission has met strong congressional 
opposition in both the House and Senate. Many congressional leaders question the utility of an 
American-led alliance that created a supposedly vital American interest in Bosnia, an area of 
marginal strategic interest for the United States. Indeed, President Clinton used American 
leadership and credibility in NATO as the chief justification for the American role in Bosnia. 
NATO became the end in itself, no longer an appropriate means to the relative end of preventing a 
major power threat to Europe. 
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR A WORKABLE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States needs alliances of all sorts in an 
interdependent world. Economic alliances allow the U.S. to remain the number one trading nation 
in the world and sustain American prosperity at home. Political alliances ensure that America is 
involved in decisions the world over that may influence the peace and prosperity of the United 
States. Military alliances give America partners in fighting her enemies and defending her interests, 
thereby lessening the costs to the U.S. in time of war and peace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. has many national interests throughout the world, 
but not all are equally important. The principal task of American statecraft is to discriminate among 
these interests, set strategic priorities, and choose policy options commensurate with their 
importance. Such an approach distinguishes among vital national interests, important interests, and 
marginal interests.<sup>5 </sup>  Naturally, America has a vital national interest in defending the 
physical territory and airspace of the United States and ensuring the safety and well-being of 
Americans abroad. To protect these vital interests, the U.S. should be willing to wage war if 
necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, the U.S. has vital national interests that lie 
beyond American shores. For both political and economic reasons, it is in America's vital national 
interest that Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf are not dominated by a hegemonic power or 
bloc of powers. It is also in America's vital national interest that the U.S. have unimpeded access to 
foreign trade and natural resources. American prosperity overwhelmingly depends on the stability 
of international markets and free trade regimes. Political scientist Benjamin Schwarz has written 
that:
<p><blockquote>
	Economic interdependence dictates security commitments. As long as world politics 
remain what they have always been, Europe and East Asia will be potentially 
unstable. And as long as U.S. prosperity is understood to depend upon the stability 
of those regions, the United States must pacify them. America's worldwide security 
commitments are a truly permanent burden.<sup>6 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, Schwarz and many others also recognize that 
this permanent burden ultimately could turn into a "wasting proposition."  America, without a 
coherent strategy, and in order to sustain its prosperity, will run itself ragged trying to preserve the 
stability of the entire world. Its engagement in world affairs therefore must be selective. The U.S. 
must set clear priorities that allow it to use its political capital and military forces for the tasks that 
most matter to America. If the U.S. tries to do everything, it will overextend itself and accomplish 
nothing.<sup> 7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid becoming the world's policeman, the 
U.S. must operate within security alliances. These alliances must preserve the conditions necessary 
for American prosperity, and must do so by "stretching" American resources through an intelligent 
definition of America's exact role and principles for sharing burdens with allies. These alliances 
must unequivocally lay out the roles that make the most sense for America and her goals abroad. 
NATO, in particular, needs to be refocused to avoid being drawn into an expensive "wasting 
proposition" that the American people will not support.
<p>

<b>WHY NATO?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most military alliances in the world can only hope to 
attain the level of political and military credibility enjoyed by NATO. However, in order for NATO 
to sustain public and congressional support in the U.S., its fundamental purpose must be refocused. 
American leaders should explain exactly why NATO is critical and should define America's basic 
role in the alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are three principal reasons why the U.S. should be a 
member of NATO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #1:</b>  NATO is needed as insurance to 
maintain the freedom and security of Europe. The U.S. has been a major European power 
throughout the 20th century, intervening in three world wars (two hot and one cold) to prevent a 
hostile power or bloc of powers from dominating the continent. An American commitment to this 
basic security condition of Europe is an insurance policy that works to prevent another great power 
war in Europe. The premiums that America pays on this policy are commensurate with the benefits. 
A focused and clearly defined policy will ensure this balance is retained. In fact, the costs of these 
premiums have dropped tremendously since the end of the Cold War. In 1989, the United States 
military had over 313,000 servicemembers permanently stationed in Europe. That number is now 
down to 100,000.<sup>8 </sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with any insurance policy, the cost of being insured 
through NATO is far less than the cost of not being insured at all. A major power threat to the 
political freedom of the European continent was the condition that inevitably drew the U.S. into the 
enormously expensive campaigns of World Wars I and II and the Cold War. It is far better to have 
100,000 troops peaceably deployed in Europe now than have to commit a million later to fight a 
war that broke out in the absence of the one power that could guarantee the core security condition 
of Europe:  Less expensive to live as lodgers now than as liberators later. Even the most superficial 
and cursory look at modern history supports this view.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #2:</b>  NATO is needed to provide general 
economic and political stability in Europe, which is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A U.S. 
commitment to the collective defense of Europe is necessary to preserve the economic prosperity of 
America. The system of international trade upon which American prosperity depends is predicated 
on free, stable, and orderly political conditions. In 1993, Europe was America's second largest 
customer, taking 31 percent of American exports. It also was the U.S.'s second largest supplier, 
providing 29 percent of imports. While the U.S. runs a large trade deficit with Asia, it has relatively 
balanced trade with Europe. More important, almost 50 percent of direct American investment 
abroad is in Europe, and over 60 percent of direct foreign investment in the U.S. comes from 
Europe. Finally, and closer to home, nearly 3 million Americans are employed in the U.S. by 
European-owned firms, and another 1.5 million American workers are supported directly by U.S. 
exports to Europe.<sup> 9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A great power threat to Europe would cause the wholesale 
disruption of the European economic order. The stability of world markets and international trade 
depend on a stable and thriving Europe. The United States cannot afford to cut itself off from the 
world market. Neither could the U.S. long sustain its economic growth if Europe as a whole were to 
enter an economic crisis born of insecurity or protracted instability. America's very standard of 
living depends on stable international financial and commodity markets, of which Europe is a 
critical element. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Reason #3:</b>  NATO is an important vehicle for 
consolidating and spreading freedom and democracy in Europe. America's defense of Europe 
through NATO strengthens America's values and identity as a nation. NATO is a community of 
democratic nations. It is based on a common set of ideals that originated in European thought but 
have become uniquely American. Helping to secure these ideals in Europe anchors the values of 
freedom and democracy at home, giving them a larger life on the world stage, and by so doing 
deepens their roots in America's own political culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition to reinforcing these ideals and values, 
American commitment to NATO serves as a solidly practical vehicle for expanding democracy and 
freedom. NATO represents not only a "zone of peace and security," but a "zone of democracy" as 
well. Democratic systems and market economies produce free and prosperous societies and are 
stabilizing forces that serve to lessen tensions and prevent the conflicts NATO is intended to deter. 
While the main mission of NATO, as a defensive alliance, is not to crusade for democracy, it must 
be recognized that democracy is both a cause and effect in NATO. An alliance of free and 
democratic nations that wish to preserve their political and economic systems, NATO provides the 
security and stability in which democracy and economic prosperity can flourish.
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these compelling reasons for American 
involvement in NATO, the American public will not support such a commitment if it is not 
supported by a clear and coherent military strategy. A commitment that does not discriminate 
between situations where American power is necessary and those where it is merely a substitute for 
that of reluctant Europeans will cause the American people to balk at an expensive transatlantic 
responsibility. A recent poll by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy 
Attitudes shows that over 70 percent of Americans believe the United States should work 
principally through alliances or coalition structures to relieve America of some of its security 
burden. More conclusively, 71 percent of Americans said the U.S. is playing the role of world 
policeman "more than it should be."<sup>10 </sup>  Americans want multilateral security structures 
that make sense for America. This means working through military alliances, not the United 
Nations. Americans want the U.S. involved in alliances where the U.S. role is clearly understood, 
the burden is shared, and American participation is essential for success.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans need to understand clearly the criteria that 
determine the American role in NATO and NATO's role in Europe. In the identity crisis that has 
characterized NATO's search for a post-Cold War role, many new or revised missions have been 
entertained and questions raised. Should NATO operate only in its traditional area of operations, or 
should it consider out-of-area missions?  Should NATO concentrate on traditional notions of 
military deterrence and warfighting, or should it engage in peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and 
military operations other than war?  Should NATO extend its nuclear guarantee to new members or 
associate members? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These questions are based on the search for relevant and 
viable missions that would justify the existence of NATO in the absence of a threat to its core role 
as a defensive alliance. As guidelines for determining the future American role in NATO, they 
completely miss the point. The U.S. role in NATO, a fundamentally American alliance, should be 
determined by principles of engagement, not by geographic parameters or mission types. Stating 
that the U.S. will undertake NATO operations only in certain areas or will not participate in certain 
types of missions unnecessarily limits American flexibility. Instead, the American role should be 
considered through guidelines that point the way to a successful and sensible role in 
NATO.<sup>11 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #1:</b>  America's principal military role is 
to serve NATO's core mission of collective defense. NATO's mission is collective defense, not 
collective security. Collective defense seeks to tie many nations to a collaborative effort in 
defending their territory. It is inherently limited, focused, and reactive in its political nature. The 
missions of collective defense are straightforward and focused:  defend members from outside 
attack. Collective defense seeks to deter through military strength and defeat an aggressor when 
deterrence fails. Collective defense organizations cannot afford to do anything except succeed 
spectacularly. Any other result amounts to failure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Collective security arrangements are different from 
collective defense. They seek to provide a forum through which members can organize cooperative 
responses to security problems, especially those below the threshold of war. Collective security 
missions can include many quasi-military efforts such as humanitarian intervention, support for 
nation-building, peacekeeping, and peace-enforcement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States already is involved in a collective 
security organization in Europe, and it is not NATO. It is the 54-member Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Established in 1973, the OSCE has become increasingly 
institutionalized since the end of the Cold War. It is an organization that can act as a forum in 
which the nations of Europe can coordinate and integrate their common efforts towards preserving 
peace and stability. Along these lines, it has undertaken very limited fact-finding, sanctions-
monitoring, and observation missions in the former Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Ukraine, Albania, and even Chechnya.<sup> 12</sup>  However, the OSCE is viewed largely as a 
toothless talking-shop. There is too much disparity among its members to institutionalize the 
military resources and structures needed for more significant military operations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The failure of the OSCE and the United Nations (another 
collective security organization) to deal competently with problems like Bosnia has thrust NATO 
into the picture. In short, events are taking NATO down the road to becoming something it never 
was:  a collective security organization. By default, not design, NATO has been consigned to fill 
the collective security gap in Europe. This means that NATO might become involved in even more 
ambiguous security missions like Bosnia. As it does so, it will find that the inevitable divergence of 
opinion over these operations will dilute its unique and formidable cohesion. NATO drew its 
strength from its core identity, which united all members. A lack of focus on its principal mission 
of collective defense will continue to weaken the alliance. As one U.N. scholar recently recognized, 
"NATO's biggest advantage over the UN, historically, has been agreement on some clearly defined 
defensive purposes, whereas the UN has an almost infinite range of responsibilities."<sup>13 </sup> 
 Using NATO for contentious collective security missions will only serve to erode that unique 
advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. public and Congress will not support an 
American-led alliance running hither and yon from one media-generated crisis to another and 
lacking criteria for distinguishing the roles of America and its European allies. The U.S. should 
refocus its role in NATO on the core mission:  to prevent a major power threat to Europe by a 
hostile power or bloc of powers. While U.S. participation in NATO peacekeeping operations 
should not be ruled out, it should be undertaken only if participation affects NATO's core mission 
or some other vital U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #2:</b>  U.S. forces must make a unique 
contribution to the military operation. The United States is the only military superpower in the 
world today. It has an enormous edge in intelligence-gathering systems, military technology, and 
the size, lethality, and professionalism of its armed forces. No other nation alone, and few 
combined, can challenge the combined air, land, sea, and space-based military capability of the 
U.S. But while America's military capabilities are enormous, they also are thinly spread. The Soviet 
threat has collapsed, but global U.S. military commitments remain. The U.S. military has been 
reduced by over one-third since the end of the Cold War and has been greatly strained in trying to 
honor its commitments with such a reduced force. This situation is made worse by the defense cuts 
imposed by the Clinton Administration -- cuts that underfund President Clinton's own strategy by 
some $150 billion over five years.<sup>14 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since American military forces are stretched thin, the U.S. 
must deploy them only when their capabilities and effect are unique. As a rule, America should not 
duplicate the efforts of the European powers. If an American infantry battalion is needed to balance 
a NATO force on paper, but does not make a unique contribution to the force, it should not be 
deployed in place of a similar European unit. The United States is not just another European power; 
it is a world power with unique capabilities and a unique role in European security. The division of 
labor in NATO military operations should be based on this premise. The intention is not to help the 
U.S. shirk mundane tasks, but to ensure that the American public see clearly that, to paraphrase 
Lyndon Johnson, "American boys aren't dying where French boys should."  The intention of an 
intelligent division of labor in NATO is to preserve, at all costs, the fundamental American security 
guarantee to Europe. To do that, Americans must be convinced that every NATO nation is pulling 
the wagon in the best way it can, and is not merely along for the ride. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Does this mean that America would lose its leadership role 
in NATO, consigning itself to a specialist's role in the alliance?  Not at all. The U.S. need not match 
the Danes infantry battalion for infantry battalion to exert its leadership. At times the U.S. may need 
to deploy a large American combat formation in order to exercise its leadership in a NATO 
coalition of forces, even if the French, British, or Germans can match the size and type of 
contribution on paper. This is a unique contribution because it demonstrates the seriousness of the 
U.S. military commitment in a way that air, sea, or support forces cannot. A leader reserves his 
talents, time, and resources for important tasks that only he may be able to accomplish. It is good 
teamwork, but not always good leadership, for a leader to duplicate the efforts of others to the 
detriment of his unique responsibilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Guideline #3:</b>  The U.S. force contribution should 
be decisive. The last principle that should guide American military operations in NATO is that the 
American contribution should be decisive. The American military effort must make the difference 
between winning and losing or drawing. Ultimately, American support for a rich and prosperous 
NATO alliance cannot be sustained if the American public and Congress see that the basic security 
condition of Europe can be guaranteed without the United States. If that is the case, it is time for the 
United States to come home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The United States military contribution should push the 
effort over the top. In some cases, this may mean the limited deployment of special capabilities that 
dramatically enhance and multiply the effectiveness of a European-dominated coalition. For 
example, the U.S. may wish to deploy intelligence, logistics, air, sea, and specialized combat 
support units to assist a European effort in out-of-area peacekeeping. In the core missions of 
NATO, the U.S. may need to dominate the force structure, base its operations on American 
command and control structures, and take the lead in determining strategy and operations. This was 
the arrangement in the Persian Gulf War. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics might argue that this distinction robs the United 
States of a leadership role in day-to-day European events and reserves U.S. influence for some 
cataclysmic battle for Europe's future. Once again, this presents a narrow reading of the principle of 
a decisive role and discounts the role that competent American leadership can play in Europe. The 
United States can exercise American leadership in NATO and European security affairs in many 
ways. American diplomacy, political influence, and economic tools all can be decisive in conflicts 
outside of a great power threat to Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, randomly deploying American military forces 
on peripheral missions in order to "fill out" a European force structure and "preserve American 
leadership" will erode American support for NATO. It traps the U.S. into having always to "lead" 
in even the most marginal operations, because European security systems have no other viable 
alternative. In a recent address to Congress, President Jacques Chirac of France seemed to support 
this line of reasoning, stating that reform of NATO would "enable the European allies to assume 
full responsibilities, with the support of NATO facilities, whenever the United States does not wish 
to engage its ground forces."<sup>15 </sup>  America leads in NATO because of the conditions that 
leadership engenders, conditions that must be favorable to the United States. Leadership is not an 
end in itself.
<p>


<b>EXPANDING THE EUROPEAN ZONE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The immediate enlargement of NATO to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia would bring a level of stability and security to Central 
Europe that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history. In short, it would expand 
the zone of peace and freedom that NATO has provided for Western Europe for almost 50 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, those who take a skeptical view of NATO 
enlargement raise questions about provoking Russia and drawing a "new Iron Curtain in Europe."  
They also point to the technical and financial difficulties involved in military integration and 
NATO interoperability. Other critics maintain that the countries of the former Warsaw Pact have 
not yet shown a sustained commitment to free market economies, democratic political institutions, 
and civilian control of the military.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The naysayers of NATO enlargement are making the same 
mistakes that opponents of German reunification made in 1990. At that time, it was widely thought 
that the Soviet Union would never accept a unified Germany. At most the Soviets might accept a 
long-term plan for confederation within a neutral Germany.<sup>16 </sup>  Among the many dire 
warnings that came from the Soviets was the prediction by then Foreign Minister Eduard 
Shevardnadze that "Europe could come again to ruin on German soil."  British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and French President Fran‡ois Mitterand were adamantly opposed to German 
unification; many Germans balked at the tremendous costs to be borne by the West German 
taxpayer; and even after the reunification plan was announced, Soviet President Gorbachev warned 
the U.S. that a reunified Germany in NATO would be an absolutely "unacceptable shift in the 
balance of power."<sup>17 </sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ten months later, in October 1990, reunification was fact. 
More significantly, the reunified Germany was not some neutral European entity, but a leading 
NATO member. What was unthinkable to the world less than a year before was neatly 
accomplished due to the driving leadership and vision of President George Bush and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. A comprehensive strategy was undertaken adroitly by these two leaders. President 
Bush in particular put forward a three-part plan which ensured that Germany would not work issues 
in isolation from the Soviets, that the Soviets would not feel forced into a corner, and that a unified 
Germany must be a full member of NATO.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This courageous approach should have been adopted for 
NATO enlargement from the beginning. In fact, the window of opportunity for bringing a 
guarantee of peace and stability to Central Europe is rapidly disappearing. The Clinton 
Administration has dragged its feet on NATO enlargement, taking the exclusive counsel of its fears. 
The Administration had hoped that the soft line on NATO enlargement would encourage Russian 
democratic reforms and make enlargement "easier" in the future. In essence, President Clinton has 
given Russia a veto over how, when, and where NATO will enlarge, ostensibly to gain Russian 
cooperation in Bosnia and stop a hard-line trend that already has occurred and is getting 
worse.<sup> 18</sup>  However, it is clear that being soft on NATO enlargement has not stopped 
the Russian drift away from democratic reforms. The election results in the Russian Duma and the 
appointment of hard-liner Yevgeny Primakov as Russian Foreign Minister should give notice that 
the trend is most likely in the other direction.<sup>19 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs a plan to admit Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia as soon as possible. The first pillar of this plan would offer full 
membership for these countries. To be sure, there will be technical difficulties, and these countries 
will put a financial burden on NATO. However, the costs are far outweighed by the greater 
geopolitical good of NATO enlargement. Full NATO membership for these Central European 
countries will bring them a security and stability they have never known.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A purely military line that distinguishes NATO from non-
NATO should stop for the time being after the admission of these four countries. As with German 
reunification, Russia must be convinced that while she has no veto, she is a partner in Europe and 
her security concerns are a consideration. Limited NATO enlargement will make it clear that 
enlargement is not intended to encircle Russia with an adversarial alliance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To reinforce this point, NATO must modify the 
Partnership for Peace program (PFP) by dropping its membership provision. Other useful aspects of 
PFP, such as association through defense cooperation, should be retained. PFP offers an official 
association with NATO and the implicit guarantee of full membership. However, it also perpetuates 
a damaging myth:  that NATO eventually can include every part of the former Soviet Union 
(including Russia). Such a move is unsound for several reasons. Admitting all the PFP states to 
NATO would dilute the cohesion of NATO as a focused alliance of collective defense. A NATO of 
some 40 nations, including Russia or other former Soviet Republics, would be a collective security 
organization as unwieldy and ineffective as the OSCE or U.N. NATO cannot be all things to all 
people; if it attempts to do so, it will lose the unique and formidable cohesion that makes it the most 
functional military alliance in existence.
<p>

<b>TOWARD A REVITALIZED NATO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has failed to develop a sound 
strategy for NATO. Lacking a practical vision for America's role in Europe, President Clinton has 
taken the alliance in dangerous directions. If the present course is not changed, it could threaten the 
survival of the alliance. To give NATO badly needed focus in the post-Cold War era, Congress 
needs to step into the breach opened by the President's failure to articulate a coherent NATO 
strategy. Congress should consider, as an amendment to the FY 1997 Defense authorization bill, a 
NATO Revitalization Act that:
<p><ul>
<li>Spells out America's vital national interests in Europe, explains the reasons for America's 
participation in NATO and the U.S. strategic role, and states that NATO is a political insurance 
policy that ensures Europe will not be dominated by a hostile power or bloc of powers;
<p>
<li>Defines the principles governing U.S. military participation in NATO, states that any 
significant American combat force commitment to a NATO operation must be firmly grounded in 
NATO's core mission of collective defense, and recognizes that U.S. forces must make a unique 
and decisive contribution to NATO military action;
<p>
<li>Encourages the Europeans to take lead roles in addressing marginal and peripheral security 
problems while guaranteeing an active U.S. support role in these endeavors; 
<p>
<li>Offers immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia 
and drops the implicit guarantee of membership for other countries in the Partnership for Peace 
program.
</ul><P>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO is an American alliance. It is a tool that America 
needs to defend its vital national interests in Europe. It does not need charity work in the form of 
attempting to reinvent itself as a pan-European alliance of collective security. NATO protects the 
political freedom and economic prosperity of the United States, and serves as an effective means to 
this end.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO needs to get back to basics. In the absence of a 
clear and present danger to Europe, it has lost its focus. It has tried to become relevant by 
embarking on military make-work programs for the United Nations, and now on its own behalf. 
These diffuse efforts have diluted NATO's cohesion and caused U.S. public support for the alliance 
to erode.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and 
preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe. It will enhance this support by laying out 
principles guiding U.S. military action in NATO. These criteria will serve to put forth a clearly 
understood and sensible division of labor in NATO that will keep the alliance strong. This strong, 
cohesive, and focused NATO must undertake limited enlargement to extend the zone of peace, 
security, and freedom to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. This will enhance 
NATO as an alliance of collective defense. Forestalling enlargement and failing to refocus NATO 
will, at best, turn the alliance into an incohesive and emasculated collective security organization 
that bears no resemblance to its robust predecessor.

<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  "Advancing American Business Interests Through APEC" is our topic this morning. It is an important topic. We have three excellent panelists who will approach it from different points of view.
<p>
This program is a joint production of the Heritage American Trader Initiative (ATI) Advisory Council, newly formed in the last year, and the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Heritage Asian Studies Center</a>. The ATI brings together the <a href="/heritage/library/index/g3.html">foreign policy</a> and <a href="/heritage/library/index/l1.html">international trade</a> aspects of Heritage's work, which are considerable, and we have created a new advisory council of private-sector business and policy leaders, which I am pleased to chair. I'm Barbara Franklin, former U.S. Commerce Secretary. The other half of the equation is Heritage's Asian Studies Center, which has been going on for some time and which really is excellent. I know <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> is here; he is the director of that program. So, with this bit of introduction, we will begin.
<p>
The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) was founded in 1989, at the instigation of Australia. The United States has been a member ever since, and in 1993 hosted the first meeting of the leaders of the member countries in Seattle. There are now eighteen countries that belong to APEC. The obvious ones are in the Pacific Rim, plus the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Chile. Ten working groups have been activated as a part of the APEC framework, and there is a secretariat today in Singapore.
<p>
That this group was formed at all is, I think, a reflection of the dynamic growth that is prevailing in Asia today, with economies growing, in many cases, in double digits. That part of the world is a very important marketplace for the U.S. In U.S. terms, our exports to Asia grew 12 percent in 1994 from the preceding year, to over $153 billion. Our direct investment climbed 17 percent in that region, to over $108 billion in 1994. Our exports to Asia now support 3.1 million jobs here at home.
<p>
There was an historic event at the APEC leaders' meeting in 1994. In fact, it was so historic that some of us wondered whether it was possible. At last year's meeting, on November 15, the heads of the APEC governments decided to set a goal for themselves:  to create "free and open trade and investment" in that region by the year 2020. President Suharto of Indonesia, where that meeting was held, deserves a great deal of credit for overcoming a lot of differences in points of view, economic realities, and cultures. He did quite a magnificent job.
<p>
Now we have before us this year's meeting coming up in just a few weeks in Japan, with the Japanese as hosts and with Prime Minister Murayama as the chairman. I think it would be fair to say that our Japanese friends have not been as aggressive in putting this meeting together as we might have hoped. After last year we began to have high hopes for what might be possible, and the hope was that we would come out of this meeting with a framework for implementing this free trade concept in the Pacific Rim by the year 2020.
<p>
Right now, we have a bit of a split, and that is what I hope some of our panelists will address. We have a split in the ranks, with the Japanese having proposed a "flexibility" that would allow the membership to exclude certain sectors, mainly agriculture, from the trade liberalization discussions. This concerns us. The U.S. is not in that camp. The "flexibility" group includes -- in addition to Japan -- China, Korea, and Taiwan. On the other side we have ourselves, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the other countries.
<p>
In just a few short weeks, on November 19, we will have this meeting in Osaka. So the real question is:  Can this division over "flexibility" and the exclusion of agriculture be overcome at this meeting?  That is really the biggest question. I have read articles recently that would indicate that maybe APEC doesn't matter, that business will flourish with or without it. It did before APEC was formed in the Pacific Rim, and some say business activity will overtake and outrun the APEC process. We have two representatives from our business community here, and we will be very interested in your answers to that question. And with that, let me introduce the panelists.
<p>
First of all is Stuart Allan, who is Director of the Office of Economic Policy, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at the Department of State. This is the office that interacts with APEC and is involved in planning this conference. Mr. Allan is a career foreign service officer, having joined the department in 1971. He has served as Counselor of Economic Affairs at our embassy in Australia and has also served in the Netherlands, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Mexico. He is a graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina, with an M.A. in economics from the University of Wisconsin.
<p>
<b>STUART ALLAN:</b>  Thank you very much, Barbara. It's a great pleasure to be here today to talk about this very important question of free trade in the Asia Pacific region and the prospects for moving forward on that. Sandy Kristoff, my boss, does extend her sincere regrets. She had been scheduled to come, she wanted to come, but as we move closer to ministerial and summit meetings, the leaders' meeting, she gets pulled over to the White House quite frequently. So she extends her regrets.
<p>
In Canberra in 1989, when Secretary of State Baker joined the other foreign ministers for what was to be a very informal discussion on shared interests in the region, there was a lot of skepticism about the Australian initiative to pull the meeting together. There was some doubt in the region, particularly among some in Southeast Asia, as to the utility of the idea. But after the ministers met for a couple of days of fruitful discussion, they discovered that indeed they had a lot in common, that there were a lot of things they would like to pursue. They sketched out a work program in particular sectors where there might be prospects for cooperation to enhance trade and to enhance the ability of firms to do business in the region. From that slow and hesitant start, APEC has really burgeoned.
<p>
Barbara has pointed out the seminal event in Seattle in 1993, when President Clinton really elevated APEC from a meeting of foreign ministers and trade ministers to an annual meeting of leaders of the APEC economies. Then President Suharto last year hosted a similar meeting in Bogor, just outside of Jakarta, where APEC took another very important step forward. President Suharto, as an important leader of the developing member economies in APEC, and as a leader of the developing world as head of the non-aligned movement, was able to convince all the member economies of APEC to undertake this commitment to achieve free trade and investment in the region by specified dates. Those specified dates were 2010 for the industrialized members of the group and 2020 for the developing member economies.
<p>
So the challenge before the APEC members this year has been to frame an action agenda which the leaders requested. They asked the ministers to come forward with specific, detailed proposals on how to get from where we are to where they have committed us to be in 15 to 25 years. That has proved to be a major challenge over the past year. The Japanese have worked very hard, and it has been difficult. The situation in Japan is such that Prime Minister Murayama, as a member of a coalition government, is doing what he can to provide leadership. Within Japan there are competing bureaucracies that sometimes affect the Japanese ability to do things; but even with those constraints, they have worked very hard this year to try to frame an action agenda, working with the 17 other member economies, that could be finalized by the foreign and trade ministers in their ministerial meeting in Osaka and then promulgated by the leaders in their meeting on November 19 in Osaka.
<p>
The draft, as it now stands, is maybe 70 to 80 percent agreed but still has some very important components that have yet to be concluded. The draft includes a section of general principles that the APEC member economies will seek to adhere to as they move forward to the free trade goal. Those principles include things like the main point that Barbara mentioned, the question of comprehensiveness. Under that principle, the question is:  As we move forward, will it be to comprehensively liberalize trade and investment, or will there be exceptions?  In the leaders' declaration last year, they did not mention any exceptions. They said "free trade and investment in the region" by specified dates.
<p>
But as we've engaged in this initiative this year, moving from the political commitment to the practical reality, a number of member economies have found that it begins to be very hard to swallow. I think the reasons are quite understandable. They were quite evident at the closing days of the Uruguay Round, for example. We found with a number of the member economies, particularly Korea and Japan, that the problem of agricultural liberalization was a major difficulty for them, but they moved forward.
<p>
Our approach is that the APEC leaders did not state any exception to comprehensive free trade and investment liberalization, and the leaders did not say anything about special consideration for sensitive sectors. The one understanding the leaders had was a recognition of the different levels of development, and that was reflected in the two different target dates, with the industrialized by 2010 and the developing by 2020.
<p>
How do we deal with this problem at this point?  That has yet to be decided, but my sense is that in the run up to the ministerial meeting there will be intensive discussions in advance in Osaka. If the issue cannot be resolved at the working level, it will probably go to the ministers. And if the ministers are unable to reach agreement on this question of comprehensive coverage, I think it will ultimately have to go to the leaders. After all, it was leaders who made the commitment, it was leaders who did not say "except for sensitive sectors," and if there is some clarification required for the ministers and the rest of us, then maybe the leaders will have to do that. So the jury is out on this question of comprehensiveness and whether there might be an exception for agriculture.
<p>
The reason we are fairly firm on this, quite firm on it, is that once we start making exceptions for sensitive sectors -- again, agriculture in the case of Japan and Korea -- we will find that everybody has a sensitive sector. And if everyone was able to identify one sensitive sector for exclusion -- I could imagine, for example, elements in the U.S. would be happy for the Japanese to exclude agriculture -- we might exclude textiles, the Chinese might exclude automobiles, the Southeast Asians might exclude financial services. Pretty soon, if everyone takes one thing off the table, you don't have much left. It's quite easy to picture an unraveling of the objective. Moreover, agriculture is an important trading commodity, one that we are very efficient at exporting, so agriculture is an important issue. We will have to see where that comes out.
<p>
Other items in the principles section of the draft action agenda include things like the question of nondiscrimination; that is one that has to be worked out. The question of comparability is critical as member economies move forward to achieve the free trade goal:  How do they do it, and how does one assure that the efforts and, more important, the market access results are mutually beneficial and comparable?  These are open issues, and I think we will be able to reach agreement on them, but they are not yet agreed.
<p>
The second part of the draft action agenda addresses the central question of the process:  How do we do this over the next 15 to 25 years?  To generalize, there have been roughly two different approaches to this question. On one side, a number of member economies would prefer more of a voluntary and unilateral effort, whereby they accept the goal but move forward in their own way over the next 15 to 25 years to open up the different sectors, to address the different issues, so that they achieve the commitment. At the other end of that spectrum is a group of countries that think you cannot depend entirely on voluntarism, although some member economies have indeed been doing a lot unilaterally. Many of the countries in Southeast Asia, for their own benefit, have been deregulating, lowering tariffs unilaterally, to help open up their economies and continue to enjoy the rapid growth that they have enjoyed, in part because of wise, market-oriented policies.
<p>
On the other hand, there are other member economies in Asia where the track record is less encouraging. Therefore, for all the member economies to be confident that we are going to achieve the goal, some believe that we cannot depend solely on voluntarism and unilateralism, that we also need some collective action where we sit down and talk through some issues and agree on where we are going and how fast we are going to get there.
<p>
In the actual action agenda, what I think we will find is perhaps a mix of these different methods that might include unilateral and voluntary actions, might include some collective actions by member economies, ongoing actions in the context of the WTO to meet multilateral commitments which will also be beneficial in an APEC context. In APEC we have this notion of "18 minus X."  Of the 18 members of APEC, perhaps a subset of 12, for example, might be able to agree on action in a particular area. And if the other six cannot move forward in the near term, subsets of the whole group can move forward. This is copied from a technique that is used in ASEAN, where they have a "6 minus X" approach. If some parts of ASEAN, say five of the six, can move forward, you don't hold out for absolute consensus; the other one basically catches up later and the five move ahead.
<p>
After principles and a process section, the key part of the action agenda will be a section that identifies specific sectors and issues that we will be focusing on at the outset and consistently over the 15 to 25 years. These issues include things like trade in services, intellectual property protection, government procurement, regulation and deregulation, competition policy, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers. There is an enumeration of 14 or 15 specific sectors and issues where the member economies are going to focus their efforts as they pursue liberalization individually, collectively, in the WTO, 18 minus X -- the different methodologies.
<p>
That is where we stand. The senior officials of APEC -- this is the group just below the ministers level -- have met six times or so this year, both in a special restricted negotiating context and in the general meetings they routinely have. The action agenda draft is, as I say, about 80 percent toward where we need to be, but a lot of important work has yet to be done.
<p>
I would like to turn a little bit away from what I have been talking about, which is what has seized the headlines and focused the attention of a lot of people in the last 12 months, and understandably so, to look at another aspect of APEC:  the more short-term, the more practical, concrete kinds of things that APEC has been doing and will continue to do to provide some tangible benefits for business. This is what APEC really started on back in 1989, with these working groups looking at tourism, looking at telecommunications, looking at transportation, looking at energy -- some of the sector-specific working groups looking at ways the member economies could cooperate.
<p>
Let me just mention a few of the kinds of things that have happened or will be happening in this area, in different categories. One is activities that increase transparency. This is important. I think it is fair to say we have one of the most transparent trade and investment regimes in the world. But in the Asian part of APEC -- and, again, think of Southeast Asia, think of China, developing economies -- transparency is a problem for businessmen. To the extent that through APEC we can be clear in terms of what the business rules, procedures, and so forth are, and make that information more readily available to businessmen, that should make it easier to do business.
<P>
A couple of examples. One is the customs guidebook, a publication by the APEC Customs Subcommittee with information on the regulatory regimes, non-tariff barriers, and so forth, all collected in one place, in English, available globally for exporters of all the member economies. Another transparency measure seems kind of small and very specialized, but is quite important for one sector, and that is the fish inspection system handbook. There is a Fisheries Working Group looking at both health and safety and trade issues in the fisheries area. The U.S. is an exporter of seafood products, and seafood is traded widely in the APEC region. This is one of the most highly regulated sectors because of safety and health concerns. Now, through this working group, a handbook has been published that identifies what the rules, regulations, contact points, and so forth are to import and export shellfish and seafood products.
<p>
Another type of practical measure I would characterize as in the "doing business" category. This differentiation between "doing business" measures and "transparency" measures may seem a little artificial, but just let me give you a few other examples. Through one of the working groups of the Committee on Trade and Investment, over the last year the APEC member economies have developed a tariff database. It is now on a CD-ROM and can be purchased for $50 or $60 from the APEC secretariat; I can give you a contact point in the Commerce Department that can tell you exactly how to do it. Here on a CD-ROM, which will be updated annually, are all the tariff schedules for all the member economies, easily accessible on a common tariff description. I think it is BTN or the standard tariff classification. The key thing here is for American businesses, or any other businesses that are considering exporting a product into the APEC region, to find the tariff level. Is it a prohibitive tariff?  Is it something they could deal with and still be competitive in that target market?  Here is a key "doing business" question, with the information readily available.
<p>
Another one that we kicked off a few years ago was called the APEC Partnership for Education. I think this was initiated about 1991. The idea was that there are lots of foreign students studying in the United States, including many from Southeast Asia. They come here for four or five or six years and learn excellent English, become familiar with American education and the way we approach business and so on. There also are a lot of American multinationals working in Southeast Asia or in Asia that would like to offer employment to many of these students that have the language and American orientation. Many of those graduates, as they go back to their home countries, would like to offer their services as employees of those companies. So it was really a matchmaking exercise that was set up with some seed money from the U.S. Agency for International Development. I think in recent years that seed money has been removed, and the latest I heard is it is now self-sustaining by the two parties, the buyer and seller. I'm not sure who pays most of the costs, but it is an ongoing effort.
<p>
Each year for the last several years, in advance of the APEC ministerial meetings, there has been a customs symposium. I think we kicked this off in Seattle and found it to be very useful, where customs officials sit down and talk with importers and exporters about practical problems faced by firms doing business in that country. I sat in on a small part of this in Jakarta last year, and this was an incredibly well-attended event:  a roomful of probably three or four hundred businessmen talking with Indonesian customs officials. They had the director-general and the other customs officials, as well as some international customs officials from the GATT and the World Customs Organization, talking about practical problems in an actual forum where businessmen could go into some of the problems in terms of importing and exporting in Indonesia:  good contacts and a good way to exchange information and seek to improve procedures and solve problems.
<p>
Another example is mutual recognition agreements. This is something that is still being worked on. Member economies have different product standards, and products typically will have to be tested and approved by different testing organizations. Even though individual economies may have their own standards for their own reasons, the ideal is to have a harmonized standard, but in many cases that will not be possible. In terms of testing and testing conformance to standards, is it fruitful and efficient to test every product in every place, or can we in APEC come up with an approach where we agree to test it once and accept it everywhere and, if so, this really facilitates movement of products in the region?  Again, I think this is probably less a problem in the United States, but I know that many American exporters, as they try to ship a product into Japan or into China, face tremendous problems. Sometimes each product has to be tested. So if we could somehow simplify testing procedures, recognize the results of tests regionwide, that should really facilitate the movement of products in the region.
<P>
Finally, there is another category of tangible, near-term, and practical benefits for business, and I put it under the business promotion rubric. I'll give just a couple of examples. One example is simply showcasing technologies. This year Secretary of Transportation Peña hosted an APEC Transportation Ministerial meeting. All of the transport ministers from around the region met here in Washington for two days for an excellent session in one of the conference rooms of the State Department. Day One of that session was a symposium of the ministers with the business communities. Every minister was invited, and most of them brought a group of businessmen concerned with the transportation sector. For a day, the ministers sat down and talked with businessmen about transportation issues in the region.
<p>
There was an official ministers-only session the next day, and then Secretary Peña invited all of the ministers to go with him on a short tour through the United States in order to showcase some of the transportation technology of the U.S. They went to the new Denver airport, which Secretary Peña knew a lot about, as well as to Seattle to look at Boeing, look at some of the infrastructure there, and I think down to San Francisco:  a good opportunity to showcase American technology to ministers from the region. We all know that infrastructure growth in the region, particularly transportation infrastructure, is very important and offers a lot of opportunities. So the post-ministerial tour provided a good exposure for U.S. transportation technology.
<p>
There was another, similar event in Vancouver a couple of years ago, when APEC environmental ministers met under Canadian chairmanship and there was a showcase of environmental technology. I think many American environmental technology companies showed their products at that time. I would hope that there will be more opportunities of the business promotion kind.
<p>
Another impact of APEC, in my opinion -- and this may be more important for the United States than most other member economies -- is to raise the profile of the opportunities in Asia. This is not a conscious objective of U.S. policy, but it is really an important byproduct. In the United States, we have very competitive multinationals, very active globally and in the region. But in the United States, we also have lots of small and medium-sized enterprises which are accustomed to doing business in their state, maybe nationally, but they are not sufficiently oriented to international exports and international investment opportunities. To the extent that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Commerce go to the ministerial and APEC leaders' meetings and thereby draw attention to the opportunities in Asia, they can stimulate the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises in exploring opportunities in Asia that they might not have thought about before.
<p>
Small and medium-sized business here is one of the great generators of new technology, of jobs and so on, and to the extent we can get small business more internationally oriented, that is good for the United States. This is true also in most of the other member economies. Small business is an important component of many of the developing economies, and many of the practical results in APEC that I described earlier really are more beneficial to small businesses, which face these big expenses in lack of transparency and lack of knowledge, than to IBM or General Motors, which are much more comfortable working internationally.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Next is Philip Vaughn, Director of Government Relations for Fluor Corporation, a very large, diversified engineering and construction company operating in over 50 countries. Prior to joining Fluor, Phil was vice president of International Business Government Counselors, a consulting firm here in the District. Before that, he was on the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee when Dan Rostenkowski was the chairman and with the Peace Corps in Zaire. He graduated from Georgetown, with a B.S. in foreign service and an M.A. in Arab studies, and speaks French, Arabic, and Italian.
<p>
<b>PHILIP VAUGHN:</b>  Thank you very much for asking me to be here today. As a real believer in APEC, I was very pleased to be a part of this program this morning. Actually, Fluor is very active in Asia. We have offices in all the APEC countries except for Brunei, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.
<p>
Our involvement in this started last year, when the President asked our chairman, Les McCraw, to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, which is the business advisory group to the APEC leaders. The Pacific Business Forum is made up of two members from each APEC economy, one from a large business -- in the case of the U.S., Fluor Corporation -- and one from a small business. The small business representative for the United States was Discovery Communications, although Discovery Communications is actually not all that small. For the past two years, Fluor has also been co-chairman of the Pacific Business Forum. We have done this with Indonesia last year, and this year we have been co-chairman with Indonesia and Japan.
<p>
I was asked to speak about business views toward APEC. I'm not going to go into great detail on the report which the Pacific Business Forum produced, but I will be happy to send people copies if they want to contact me. I wanted to talk a little more broadly about why APEC is important. I think it's a bit difficult to represent U.S. business views as a whole, for two reasons. First, as you all know, the U.S. business community is probably among the most diverse in all the APEC economies. There are differences between large and small, which we touched on earlier, between the manufacturing sectors and service sectors, heavy industry and high tech; so, depending on who you talk to, you might get a very different opinion on APEC.
<p>
Second, there really is a distinct lack of awareness in the business community about APEC and what it does, so I think, as a whole, business views have not fully matured at this point. Indeed, until our chairman was asked to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, Fluor was aware of APEC but certainly not deeply involved in it. 
<p>
Before I go into the specific trade and investment issues that we were looking at this year in APEC as the PBF, I would like to make some very broad comments on why I think APEC is important to business.
<p>
First, it can help solidify the economic and political security of the region that business needs to feel confident in its investments. It is clearly in the interests of the U.S. business community to have a forum in which the U.S. can deepen its ties with all of its trading partners in the Asia Pacific region.
<p>
Second, APEC offers a mechanism for anchoring the U.S. in the region, as I mentioned, both strategically and economically. There seems to be a lot of debate today, at least around APEC, that America may be too focused on Asia, putting too much emphasis on the region; that we do not have a natural role there; that the cultural differences are far too great; and that we really should be focusing perhaps more on Latin America or Europe. I think the physical distance, the cultural differences, and the lack of a clear role in the post-Cold War world perhaps make APEC even more important, and keeping the U.S. involved in the region through APEC even more a priority.
<p>
Third, APEC is the only truly regional grouping in existence, and I think it can play an important role in bringing together the NAFTAs, the AFTAs (which is the ASEAN free trade area), the CERs (which is the free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand), and prevent the region from breaking down into a multiplicity of isolated subregional trading blocs.
<P>
And fourth, APEC offers the U.S. a broad policy forum in which we can sit down and talk to our trading partners in more constructive dialogue, rather than in destructive confrontations that I think we have had in the past.
<p>
Beyond the tariff and trade and business reasons, I think those four are very broad areas or reasons to stay involved in the APEC process. But when you get to the business side, people always look at me and say, "Well, why APEC?  Why are you involved in it?  Does this really have any meaningful impact on your bottom line?"  I think the answer really is a resounding, "Yes, it can," but only if APEC gets its act together this year and starts taking some tough decisions in Osaka is it going to prove to business once and for all that it is willing to move from being a policy talk shop into an action-oriented forum. I think that is the main thing we need to see from Osaka this year.
<P>
Our report that the Pacific Business Forum produced this year, in fact, addresses this issue. Our theme is "Making APEC more relevant to business."  To achieve that business relevancy, APEC has to do two things this year. First, it has to establish itself as a credible and effective organization in the eyes of business, and, put very simply, that means we want to see APEC take some actions that are going to have an immediate and beneficial impact on our ability to conduct business in the region. If APEC does not begin to undertake these types of activities, I think it is going to lose its growing credibility with business, both in the U.S. and in the region, and the nascent business support you are seeing for APEC is going to evaporate.
<p>
Second, APEC really needs to strengthen its ties with business. There has been some general agreement that business has been the driving force behind the tremendous growth we have seen in the region in the last decade. Business is going to continue to do its part to drive that growth and create jobs, but we can do that better in partnership with the public sector through APEC in breaking down some of the barriers that you referred to. That is going to take a great deal of effort, because I'm not convinced that all of the APEC economies really want business input into the process. It is clear the U.S. is looking for it. Australia is looking for it. But I think there is a definite lack of interest in business participation by some of the other members.
<p>
Looking to the Osaka meetings, which are coming up in just about two weeks, there are three very broad things we would like to see. First of all, we need to see a clear road map on how we are going to get to free trade and investment in the region by 2010 and 2020. This would include time lines, milestones, and frequent progress reviews so that we can see exactly who is living up to their commitments, who is not living up to their commitments, and whether APEC as a whole is moving in the right direction. Declarations of intent and promises to do things next year and the year after simply aren't good enough any more.
<p>
Second, at Osaka we need to see a series of steps announced which prove APEC is serious about this trade and investment liberalization agenda. I think these can be small things. They don't all have to be focused on the tariff area. We can accelerate the work they have done in the customs area. We can look at visa-free entry for business travelers. You could look at further work on the rather weak investment principles that were adopted in Jakarta last year, look at continued work on intellectual property. These things are not difficult. They don't cost money, and with a little bit of political will by the leaders, I think they could be done.
<p>
Third, as I mentioned earlier, we need to strengthen this partnership between business and APEC, and there are two main ways I think that can be done. PBF has recommended that a successor organization to our group be established, which would be an official advisory group by regional business to the APEC leaders and ministers. I think there is a lot of debate about how that is going to come out.
<p>
In addition to that formal advisory group, APEC really does need to reach out, whether they want to or not, and get business involved in the working groups -- the ten that you mentioned, some of the programs you mentioned -- on an ongoing basis. Getting a report from business once a year will not keep APEC on the right track. They need to include businessmen in the official discussions; they need to include business in all of their meetings on an ongoing basis. Otherwise, I think we are going to see APEC waver from the path they are setting this year.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to say that I think APEC really is a remarkable organization. It has come a lot further, a lot faster, than anyone might have imagined. We are always intoning this mantra:  that APEC's been around six years and, by God, it better do something this year or we're going to walk away from it. But if you look at it, APEC has been around for only six years. I think it has come rather far for an organization of 18 countries of very disparate levels of economic development, disparate languages and cultures. I think we need to support APEC -- give them a little more time than we have so far.
<P>
Let me make one last observation. I mentioned earlier about keeping the U.S. involved in Asia. There seems to be a big debate these days on Asian values and Western values, and on differences between our philosophies and our ways of doing things. This is usually in the context of why APEC must fail or why ultimately the East and West cannot work together. Well, the PBF was 34 people from 18 different economies, different economic backgrounds, different outlooks, yet over time we all learned to respect each other, to respect each other's points of view. We have worked in great harmony and, in the true spirit of APEC, achieved consensus and mutual respect. We produced a report which every person put their signature on. If this represents the future of the region, I am really very optimistic that we are going to be able to work together in a long and productive partnership, both as business and as government. Thank you.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Dan Amstutz became president and CEO of the North American Export Grain Association in Washington last April. For three years previous to that, he was executive director of the International Wheat Council in London. Earlier, he had been in the Reagan Administration for six years, first as undersecretary of Agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs and then as ambassador and chief negotiator for agriculture in the GATT Uruguay Round trade negotiations. He was one of the key architects of the U.S. agriculture position in that round. When that round started, one of the U.S.'s major objectives was to have trade in agriculture products covered by GATT -- now WTO -- rules, and that was accomplished. Before that, Dan was with Goldman Sachs. He also was with Cargill for 25 years, the culmination of which was his serving as president and CEO of Cargill Investor Services in Chicago. We particularly wanted somebody who knew the agriculture sector around the world on this panel, given the divisions within APEC about that issue, so we are eager to hear from you.
<p>
<b>DAN AMSTUTZ:</b>  Thank you, Barbara. Phil mentioned that some opine that, perhaps, here in America these days we focus too much on Asia to the exclusion of the rest of the world. But from an agricultural perspective, probably we do not focus enough. When one looks at the demographic and economic outlook, it is staggering. Just to pass on a few things that most of you have heard before, it is highly likely that the world's population by 2025 will increase by 50 percent over current levels; it is reasonable to expect that at that time some 35 percent of the world's people will live in only two countries, China and India; so, within a generation, half the number of people that live in the entire world now may be living in China and India alone.
<P>
The economic scenario is equally exciting. Currently, the five largest economies in the world are the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, and France. In the year 2020, when trade liberalization is supposed to be accomplished in the APEC, the five largest economies of the world, with the exception of the United States, will be Asian:  China, Japan, India, and Indonesia. France will be ninth largest, behind Germany, Korea, and Thailand, and Britain will be the fourteenth largest, behind Russia and barely ahead of Mexico. Canada, currently part of the G-7, will not even be in the list of the top 15. It appears that the OECD is rapidly becoming irrelevant and that it will have to be replaced by a new grouping, but that is a different subject.
<p>
Consider just one example of why agriculture is so interested in Asia. This is an OECD estimate. If China, India, and Indonesia grow by an average of 6 percent a year economically, which is entirely feasible, and their income distribution remains unchanged from current levels, by the year 2010 some 700 million people in those countries will have an average income equal to Spain today. That is 600 million more than at present. The interesting thing about that number, 700 million, is that it is roughly equal to the current combined populations of the United States, the European Union, and Japan. So in a half a generation, a sophisticated market equal in size to Europe, the U.S., and Japan will develop in China, India, and Indonesia. For the agriculture sector, that is a lot of business:  a lot of meat and a lot of all kinds of food products. It presents an exciting outlook for trade expansion.
<P>
The agriculture industry in this country, by and large, is very much in favor of trade liberalization. We believe, as an industry, that trade negotiations must be comprehensive; otherwise, they are self-defeating. That means that all industries must be involved, and all segments of each industry, and that all barriers, all forms of protection, must be addressed.
<P>
The magic of trade negotiations is the concept of reciprocity, and unless you have a comprehensive negotiation, the magic of reciprocity breaks down. How in the world can you expect the U.S. to agree to liberalize import barriers for textiles and apparel, for example, if it is not going to enjoy better market access for some products in which it has a comparative advantage, namely, in agriculture?  The conclusion must be clear:  There would be no progress.
<P>
The truth is that the history of trade negotiations, both bilateral and multilateral, has been one of addressing the subject almost on a case-by-case, product-by-product basis. The terminology is "request/offer."  Country A says, "Can you open the market for more tires that we produce here?"  And Country B says, "Maybe we can do that, but what can you do about opening opportunities for the United Parcel Service?"  I use those two examples because I read that when President Zedillo was here from Mexico, these were trade issues that he discussed with President Clinton. With heads of state and heads of government meeting with each other, this is the process that has ensued. So product by product, service by service, progress is made, but slowly. The objective of a multilateral approach is to expand markets quickly, to allow for the generation of more wealth and more buying power quickly. That can be accomplished, in my judgment, only if we follow a truly comprehensive approach.
<p>
It goes without saying that when that kind of approach is endorsed, there will be some displacement of industries in various countries. It goes without saying that there is an enormous need for retraining, for restructuring, for redeveloping industries. And that becomes a national obligation, both by government and by the private sector. The reason for reluctance, and the reason countries ask for flexibility in the approach to trade negotiation, is they do not want to face those necessities. But the payoff is more opportunity, more access, more growth for more industries. This was what we preached at the beginning of the Uruguay Round, and I am proud that we were able to maintain agriculture on a comprehensive basis during that round.
<P>
I might add that, even in my industry, there are losers from this, and there are some that say, "Wait a minute, let's show some flexibility," as the government of Japan currently says. Certainly, the textile industry of this country would like to slow down the flow of textiles and apparel into the United States. And certainly, as we have trade liberalization, there is going to be a need for some restructuring and retraining and redevelopment in that industry here in the U.S. But there are always new services and new products that can be developed and for which there can be a market around the world. Again, the question is, "How quickly, how rapidly, can world economies expand?"  And the payoff from trade liberalization is that more countries are shipping more goods and services, and more wealth is indeed generated. That is what we're searching for.
<p>
We don't need an APEC to do that, I guess, but I'm here to tell you that an APEC really facilitates it, and really permits it to work much more effectively and much more rapidly. Is APEC competing with the World Trade Organization?  Not at all. It is facilitating it and advancing the objectives of trade liberalization more rapidly.
<p>
Can there be sensitivity to weak economies in this?  The term for this in trade negotiations is S&D, special and differential:  special and differential treatment for economies that are developing more slowly, special and differential treatment for industries that have particular problems in various countries. Of course there can be, and APEC is on a dual track in this regard:  2010 for the developed countries, 2020 for the developing. And there can be flexibility shown within that -- although I should not use the word "flexibility," because it's a buzz term for exclusions, and I want to speak out forcefully against that.
<p>
Within any industry there are some that will say, "Well, let's not rush too rapidly into this because we'll make some of our very good customers unhappy."  The truth is, the best customer in the world for American agriculture is Japan. By far. And I can tell you that we in American agriculture value the markets in Japan very much. We need them, we would like them to grow, and we want to help in that effort, in that pursuit. To use the word "reciprocity" again, we're very eager to help Japan's market outlets in this country grow as well.
<P>
The fainthearted cannot prevail these days on these subjects. You really cannot have your cake and eat it too; you either support overall growth in trade, or you opt for what I would say is a no-growth situation. So, again, to sum up, the opportunities for all involved in trade expansion in all the APEC countries -- certainly in agriculture -- are dramatic and exciting. We can have optimum realization of these opportunities for all only if APEC plows forward with a truly comprehensive approach. Then the magic of reciprocity will really work. It is for all of us who are not in government to urge our governments to press hard for this, and I think we will all be pleased with the results in the years ahead.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The vast expanses of the former Soviet Union harbor oil and gas riches which will be crucial in fueling the global economy in the next century. The huge oil reserves, estimated at over 25 billion barrels, under the Caspian Sea and in the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are similar to those in Kuwait and larger than those in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Control over these energy resources and export routes out of the Eurasian hinterland is quickly becoming one of the central issues in post-Cold War politics. Like the "Great Game" of the early 20th century, in which the geopolitical interests of the British Empire and Russia clashed over the Caucasus region and Central Asia, today's struggle between Russia and the West may turn on who controls the oil reserves in Eurasia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The world now faces a choice between the cooperative exploitation by the East and West of natural resources or a wasteful struggle that could cost a fortune in blood and treasure. Regional conflicts in the Caucasus and Central Asia threaten to deny Western access to the vital oil and gas reserves the world will need in the 21st century. The wars in Chechnya, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and in Georgia were started or exacerbated by the Russian military, and the outcome of these wars may determine who controls future pipeline routes. Moscow hopes that Russia will. Powerful interests in Moscow are attempting to ensure that the only route for exporting the energy resources of Eurasia will pass through Russia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. needs to ensure free and fair access for all interested parties to the oil fields of the Caucasus and Central Asia. These resources are crucial to ensuring prosperity in the first half of the 21st century and beyond. Access to Eurasian energy reserves could reduce the West's dependence on Middle East oil and ensure lower oil and gas prices for decades to come. Moreover, oil revenues can boost the independence and prosperity of such Newly Independent States (NIS) as Azerbaijan and Georgia. For example, through production royalties, Azerbaijan could generate over $2 billion a year in revenue from its oil fields, while Georgia could get over $500 million annually from transit fees. With these new-found oil riches, non-Russian republics in the region would depend less on Russia, both economically and militarily. Independent and self-sufficient former Soviet states, bolstered by their oil revenues, would deny Russia the option of establishing a <i>de facto</i> sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two pipeline routes in Central Asia are under consideration. The first would allow oil to flow from the Azerbaijani Caspian Sea shelf to the Black Sea coast. The second would transport oil from the giant Tengiz oil field, developed by the U.S.-based Chevron corporation in Kazakhstan, in a westerly direction toward Europe and the Mediterranean. Western governments and oil companies participating in the Azerbaijani and Kazakhstani pipeline projects<sup>1</sup> face a choice: Will a neo-imperialist Russia (aided and abetted by Iran) dominate the development of Eurasian oil and its exports, or will Russia be an equal and fair player in the region with Turkey, the three Caucasian states (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), and possibly Iran?  The U.S. should respect the right of Russian companies to bid for the exploration and transport of oil and gas in the region. However, the West has a paramount interest in assuring that the Caucasian and Central Asian states maintain their independence and remain open to the West. Otherwise, Moscow will capture almost monopolistic control over this vital energy resource, thus increasing Western dependence upon Russian-dominated oil reserves and export routes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves in Central Asia, the U.S. should:
<P><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the Newly Independent States in Central Asia.</b> The U.S. should try to prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). To achieve that end, it should endeavor to ensure that Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and other Newly Independent States receive a fair portion of the oil revenues from the region. Moreover, the U.S. should strengthen bilateral and multilateral political and military cooperation with these states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil and gas companies should be allowed to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equitable basis with other countries in the region. That is their right. Forming partnerships with Western oil companies could turn the Russian business sector into an ally of the West. However, domination by military means should be rejected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> Thus far, the West has focused mainly on settling the crisis in Bosnia, relegating the Caucasus region to the back burner. Now that a Bosnian settlement has been reached, the U.S. should endeavor to settle the conflicts in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The OSCE would be a useful vehicle for pursuing these goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian geostrategic ambitions and Iranian-style religious militancy pose long-term threats to the Muslim societies of the region. These threats can be countered by helping to create free market economies, respect for the rule of law, and a civil society that respects democracy and political pluralism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> Absent a new oil pipeline, more potentially hazardous oil shipments will pass through the already clogged Bosphorus Straits. Oil tanker fires like the one in 1994 can block international shipping through the Boshporus for days, causing tens of millions of dollars in damage and threatening the lives and health of local citizens. The U.S. should support a pipeline route through the territory of Georgia and Turkey that will bring oil from Eurasia to a Mediterranean port such as Ceyhan in Turkey.
</ul><p>

<b>WARS ENDANGERING OIL TRANSIT ROUTES IN THE CAUCASUS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The War in Chechnya.</b> One of the main goals of the Russian attack on Chechnya in December of 1994 was to ensure control of the oil pipeline which runs from Baku, via Grozny, the Chechen capital, to the Russian city of Tikhoretsk. The pipeline ends at the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, designed by Russia to be the terminal for the proposed Kazakh and Azerbaijani pipelines.<sup>2</sup> In addition, Grozny boasts a large refinery with a processing capacity of 12 million tons per year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During its brief self-proclaimed independence under President Jokhar Dudayev from 1991 to 1994, Chechnya illegally exported crude oil and refined products worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. The rebel government worked closely with corrupt politicians in Moscow to obtain export licenses. Partly to cut off this activity, Russia launched a massive but covert military action in the fall of 1994 to support opponents of Dudayev. In 1994, Dudayev turned to radical Islamic elements in the Middle East and Central Asia for support. This exacerbated the religious aspect of the conflict between the Muslim Chechens and Christian Orthodox Russians. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overt military action began on December 12, 1994, when the Russian army marched on Grozny, destroying Chechnya's capital city by brutal aerial, tank, and artillery bombardment. Since the start of the campaign, over 30,000 people have been killed, and more than 300,000 have become refugees. Hostilities continue, with hostage-taking crises erupting in July 1995 and January 1996.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Drama in Georgia.</b> Another conflict affecting potential oil routes is occuring in the Caucasus republic of Georgia. Russia wants to prevent oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan from going the "Western" route through Georgia to Turkey. Moscow's support of civil strife in Georgia is directly connected to its goal of perpetuating conflict in the Caucasus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From 1991 through the end of 1993, Georgia was in the midst of a bloody civil war which pitted the supporters of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia against each other. Political violence became chronic. Eventually, the defeated Gamsakhurdia either committed suicide or was murdered under mysterious circumstances in 1993. But even after his victory over Gamsakhurdia, Shevardnadze faced challenges from warlords and militias. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In exchange for crucial Russian support, Shevardnadze finally was forced to join the CIS in October 1993, a move he had bitterly opposed. When he attempted to read a press release announcing this step, Russian diplomats took it out of his hands and gave him a Moscow-authored text to read. Such was the degree of independence enjoyed by Shevardnadze at the hands of his Russian patrons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1995, Moscow brought pressure on Shevardnadze not to build a pipeline for Azeri oil through Georgian territory. The Georgians wanted to bring oil to the Georgian port of Supsa (between Poti and Tbilisi), from which it then would be exported by tanker to Turkey. However, the Russians demurred. Soon after Shevardnadze refused to cancel the pipeline plan, he was injured in an assassination attempt when a car bomb exploded next to his vehicle on August 29, 1995. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shevardnadze has insisted repeatedly that Russia was behind this attempt on his life. The suspected culprit -- Shevardnadze's security chief, Igor Georgadze -- has escaped to Russia and continues to threaten Shevardnadze's life.<sup>3</sup>  Shevardnadze demanded that the Russians extradite the suspect, and the Russian Prosecutor General's Office issued an order for his arrest. However, the Russian Interior Minister refused the extradition, and Georgadze is still at large. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Fighting in Abkhazia.</b> Another dangerous conflict is smoldering in Abkhazia, a breakaway region in Georgia. The bitter war in Abkhazia, which began in 1992, has claimed over 35,000 lives. It was precipitated by the Russian military backing the Abkhaz separatist minority against the Georgian government in Tbilisi.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One purpose of the Russian intervention was to weaken Georgia and curb Turkish and Western influence in the region. But more important was the Russian goal of controlling access to oil. By acting as it did, Russia gained <i>de facto</i> control over the long Black Sea coastline in Abkhazia. Moscow also was protecting the Russian Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse and moving closer to the Georgian oil exporting ports in Poti, Supsa, and Batumi. In August 1995, Georgia's beleaguered President Shevardnadze agreed to place four Russian military bases on Georgian soil, thus assuring Russia's control of the oil exporting routes via the Black Sea coast. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Russia became entangled in Chechnya in 1994-1995, and word of Chechen commando training camps operating from Abkhazia spread, Moscow began to show less support for the Abkhaz rebels, who are allies of the Chechens. But Russia also has refused either to close the border with Abkhazia or to deny the separatist government in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi, financial and military support. Shevardnadze had hoped that this would be a Russian <i>quid pro quo</i> for his agreement to permit Russian military bases on Georgian territory.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict.</b> Yet another bloody war affecting potential oil pipeline routes is occurring in Nagorno-Karabakh, a small, largely Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. The enclave of Karabakh sits astride a potential oil route from the Caspian Sea to Turkey. Populated mainly by Armenians, Karabakh was put under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction in 1921 after Stalin negotiated a treaty in the Transcaucasus between communist Russia and Turkey. Strife between the mainly Christian Armenians and Shi'a Muslim Azerbaijanis broke out in 1988. Full-scale war erupted in 1992, with the Armenians demanding complete independence for Karabakh or its absorption into Armenia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A cease-fire negotiated in May 1994 has been holding. The Armenians in Karabakh have proclaimed an independent republic, which Azerbaijan refuses to recognize. Thus far, Azerbaijan has suffered political and military defeat at the hands of the Armenians, losing one-fifth of its territory since the collapse of the Soviet Union. One million people, mostly Azerbaijanis, have become refugees as a result of the war. The Azeri capital of Baku has seen the government change three times since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has supported the Armenians and the Azeris intermittently. In 1992, Moscow proposed that Russia become a guarantor of peace in the region, promising to send in 3,000 peacekeepers, but was rebuffed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional security group in Europe.<sup>4</sup>.  The OSCE "Minsk group," which consists of Russia, the U.S., Turkey, France, Sweden, and Italy, has been charged with finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict but thus far has met with only limited success. Under Western pressure, Moscow has agreed to a multilateral OSCE peacekeeping force for Karabakh. However, this force has yet to materialize, and there is still no peace agreement between the warring parties. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Azerbaijan: Key Oil Region.</b> The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is important because of the immense oil reserves controlled by Azerbaijan. Since the late 19th century, the oil in Azerbaijan has played a key role in the economies of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union, as well as in the global energy market. International business interests, such as the Nobel and Rothschild families, and even conquerors like Adolf Hitler have all vied at different times for control of Azerbaijan's oil. Even after 100 years of Russian imperial and Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan still has some of the largest reserves in the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At stake today is a $6 billion, 4 billion barrel Caspian Sea shelf petroleum deal between Azerbaijan and a consortium of large international oil companies.<sup>5</sup>  Put simply, Russia opposes the deal. The Russian oil company Lukoil is part of this international consortium, but other Russian oil interests felt excluded, and the Russian foreign and defense ministries have come out squarely against the arrangement. In addition to demanding that at least 25 percent of the deal go to Russian firms (Lukoil gets only 10 percent), Moscow wants full control of the oil exports. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Caspian Sea oil deal was facilitated first by President Abulfaz Elchibei, who was overthrown in June 1993 by former Azerbaijani KGB Chief and Brezhnev Politburo member General Heydar Aliev.<sup>6</sup>  While Elchibei was considered pro-Turkish, Aliev had a reputation for being pro-Russian. It was Aliev who signed the oil agreement in September 1994. On October 9, 1995, the Azerbaijani International Oil Consortium (AIOC) announced that "early" oil (approximately 80,000 barrels a month) would be split between two pipelines. The northern line would go to the Russian port of Novorossiysk (via unstable Chechnya) and the western line to the Georgian port of Supsa in two separate pipelines. This was a compromise decision supported by the Clinton Administration and aimed at placating Moscow, but it failed to do so. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite his attempts to accommodate Russia, Moscow apparently considers Aliev too independent. Therefore, the Kremlin is backing Suret Husseinov, a warlord who reportedly has good connections with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.<sup>7</sup>  Between 1993 and 1995, four unsuccessful coups were attempted against Aliev, reportedly with Moscow's support. Russia also is playing the ethnic separatism card against Aliev, bolstering the national movement of the Lezgin minority in the north of Azerbaijan and the movement of the Talysh minority in the south. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Aliev has proved himself to be a tough survivor. Although Azerbaijan has joined the CIS, he has managed to resist the pressure to deploy Russian military bases or troops on Azerbaijani soil. However, Moscow probably can outwait Aliev, in the meantime fostering instability in Azerbaijan. Russia will attempt to block any large-scale production or exports of oil from Azerbaijan until such time as a more compliant man can be put in charge.
<p>

<b>OIL POLITICS AND RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM IN THE "NEAR ABROAD"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The main threat to the equitable development of Eurasian oil is the Russian attempt to dominate the region in a <i>de facto</i> alliance with the radical Islamic regime in Tehran.<sup>8</sup>  Russia benefits from instability in the Caucasus, where wars and conflicts undermine independence and economic development while hindering the export of oil from the region's states.<sup>9</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moscow has gone beyond words to establish its power in the Caucasus. The Russians are setting up military bases in the region in order to gain exclusive control over all future pipelines. Georgia now has four Russian bases and Armenia has three, while Azerbaijan is still holding out under severe pressure from Moscow. In addition, members of the Commonwealth of Independent States are required to police their borders jointly with Russian border guards, and thus are denied effective control over their own territory. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Attempts to Reintegrate the South.</b> The struggle to reestablish a Russian sphere of influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia started in early 1992. While not a full-scale war, this struggle employs a broad spectrum of military, covert, diplomatic, and economic measures. The southern tier of the former Soviet Union is a zone of feverish Russian activity aimed at tightening Moscow's grip in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. The entire southern rim of Russia is a turbulent frontier, a highly unstable environment in which metropolitan civilian and military elites, local players, and mid-level officers and bureaucrats drive the process of reintegration.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin called for a re-examination of Russia's borders to the detriment of her neighbors, especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan. For example, upon his return from a state visit to the U.S. in September 1994, Yeltsin reiterated Russia's "right" to conduct "peacemaking" in the "near abroad," to protect Russian speakers and to exercise freedom of action in its sphere of influence.<sup>11</sup>  These statements were echoed on numerous occasions by former Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other key policymakers in Moscow. In his September 1995 Decree "On Approval of the Strategic Policy of the Russian Federation Toward CIS Member States,"<sup>12</sup> Yeltsin outlined plans to create a CIS military and economic union. Some observers have termed this design an informal empire "on the cheap," a "sustainable empire" which is less centralized than the old Soviet Union.<sup>13</sup>  The aim of such an arrangement would be to ensure Russia's control of the oil and gas reserves in Eurasia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Competing political interests inside Russia's neighbors often prompt local elites to challenge the faction in power and to seek Moscow's support. For example, Russian oil chieftains in Kazakhstan and military commanders who are still in place in Moldova and Georgia naturally maintain close links with Moscow. Where it lacks troops on the ground, Moscow supports the most pro-Russian faction in the conflict, such as Trans-Dniestrian ethnic Russians in Moldova, the separatist Abkhazs in Georgia, warlords and former communist leaders in Azerbaijan, and pro-communist clans in Tajikistan. This is a classic scenario for imperial expansion. What is common to these conflicts is that without Russian support, the pro-Moscow factions (regardless of their ethnicity) could not have dominated their respective regions, and would be forced to seek negotiated and peaceful solutions. In each case, appeals by the legitimate governments of the Newly Independent States to restore their territorial integrity were ignored by Moscow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russian political elites have not overcome the imperialist ideology that inspired both pre-1917 and Soviet expansionism. For today's Moscow bureaucrats and generals, as for their predecessors in St. Petersburg prior to 1917, the turbulent southern periphery is a potential source of political fortunes, promotions, and careers. For Russian politicians in search of a grand cause, re-establishing the empire and paying for it with Eurasian oil revenues is a winning proposition, especially in the murky environment in the aftermath of imperial collapse. 
<p>

<b>KEY RUSSIAN PLAYERS IN THE GREAT OIL GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and security services are by far the most resolute driving force behind the restoration of a Russian-dominated CIS. They are playing a key role in ensuring Moscow's control over the pipeline routes. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall terminated, at least temporarily, confrontation with the West, leaving the Red Army's General Staff, the Russian military intelligence (GRU), and the former KGB desperately seeking new missions. The biggest of these new missions is to establish control over Caucasus and Central Asian oil, establishing a Russian sphere of influence in the process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control. Russian military activities over the last four years indicate an attempt to consolidate strategic control of oil sources and export routes in Eurasia. For example, the war in Chechnya blocked an important pipeline from Azerbaijan through Grozny, and the victory of the Abkhaz separatists, supported by the Russian military, further secured the Russian oil terminals in the ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse. In order to obtain an oil route in the region, Western exporters may be pressured to reach accomodations with the Russian generals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian intelligence services are also involved. The successor to the KGB's First Chief Directorate, now known as the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia (SVRR) and led until January 1996 by KGB general and now Foreign Minister Evgenii Primakov, published an important document in 1994 on Russia's policies in the "near abroad," called "Russia-CIS: Does the Western Position Require Correction?"<sup>14</sup>  General Primakov's staff argued that any attempt to integrate the CIS states into the global economy without Moscow's cooperation is doomed to fail. Russia already has effectively stopped Kazakhstani and Azerbaijani joint oil exporting ventures in their tracks. 

<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The states of the CIS's southern tier were coerced by Russia even before they declared their independence from the USSR. Moscow incited local pro-Russian factions, such as Abkhazians in Georgia, Armenians in Karabakh, and hard-line communist pro-Russian clans in Tajikistan, to challenge the independence and territorial integrity of these nascent states. The Russian military provided advisers, hardware, training, planning, and coordination for the military activities in these areas. As a result, hundreds of thousands have been left dead, wounded, or homeless. In addition, these violent conflicts blocked the transit routes to the West for Caspian and Central Asian oil. 
<p>

<b>THE U.S. ROLE IN THE GREAT GAME</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much is at stake in Eurasia for the U.S. and its allies. Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The wars which would be required to restore the Russian empire would prove much more costly not just for Russia and the region, but for peace, world stability, and security. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, these conflicts may escalate to include the use of weapons of mass destruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence both in Eurasia and throughout the world. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.<sup>15</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Domination of the Caucasus would bring Russia closer to the Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. Russian imperialists, such as radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have resurrected the old dream of obtaining a warm port on the Indian Ocean. If Russia succeeds in establishing its domination in the south, the threat to Ukraine, Turkey, Iran, and Afganistan will increase. The independence of pro-Western Georgia and Azerbaijan already has been undermined by pressures from the Russian armed forces and covert actions by the intelligence and security services, in addition to which Russian hegemony would make Western political and economic efforts to stave off Islamic militancy more difficult. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Eurasian oil resources are pivotal to economic development in the early 21st century. The supply of Middle Eastern oil would become precarious if Saudi Arabia became unstable, or if Iran or Iraq provoked another military conflict in the area. Eurasian oil is also key to the economic development of the southern NIS. Only with oil revenues can these countries sever their dependence on Moscow and develop modern market economies and free societies. Moreover, if these vast oil reserves were tapped and developed, tens of thousands of U.S. and Western jobs would be created. The U.S. should ensure free access to these reserves for the benefit of both Western and local economies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to protect U.S. and Western interests in Eurasia and ensure free and fair access to the oil reserves of the region, the United States should:
<p><ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strive to preserve the independence and economic viability of the New Independent States in the region.</b> In cooperation with Britain, Germany, and France, the U.S. should prevent the reconstitution of Moscow's sphere of influence in the southern CIS. The West should not grant Moscow <i>carte blanche</i> in the "near abroad" in exchange for cooperation in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. should lead other Western countries in implementing programs that support independent statehood, free-market development, and the rule of law in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and the Central Asian states. Training for the civil and security services of these countries should be stepped up, and economic reforms, including privatization of industries and agriculture, should be continued. Moreover, sanctions on technical and humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan, imposed at the height of the Karabakh conflict, should be lifted to increase Washington's leverage in settling the conflict there.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Ensure that Russia is not a dominant, but rather an equal partner in developing the oil resources of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</b> Russian oil companies should be assured of equitable access to the development of oil resources and pipeline projects. The strategic goal of the West should be the creation of a level playing field that allows Russian and Western corporations to participate in the development of Eurasian energy resources on an equal footing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If cooperation from Russia is not forthcoming, the U.S. should oppose attempts by the Russian security establishment to impose a single direction for the pipelines -- i.e., north, via Russian territory. This kind of geopolitical <i>diktat</i> would give Moscow an unacceptable level of control over the flow of oil to Western markets and would make the West vulnerable to Russia's political whims. The U.S. government should demand that Russia stop fostering conflicts in the area. At the same time, Washington should promise that the interests of Russian companies operating in the region will be taken into account in current and future oil consortia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Work through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and through bilateral channels, to defuse ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus.</b> The OSCE has been charged by its members with settling the conflicts in Chechnya, Abkhazia, and Karabakh. This authority is recognized by Russia. So far, the OSCE has not been successful. To become more so, the OSCE should step up efforts to bring together the leaders of the Newly Independent States and separatist ethnic groups so they can find acceptable political solutions to the conflicts in the region. The OSCE should assign senior politicians to mediate in order to prevent new conflicts, particularly between the Azerbaijanis and the Lezgin and Talysh minorities in Azerbaijan, or between the Georgians and the Adzhar minority. An OSCE-sponsored conference to promote minority rights in the Southern CIS would be in order. The U.S. and its allies should support the OSCE's efforts and initiate a bilateral dialog with leaders of the ethnic groups to assist them in finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> in their countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Strengthen secular Muslim societies, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, against Islamic militant groups.</b> Both Russian ambitions and Islamic radicalism threaten the pro-Western orientation of regimes in the region. Economic development, support for basic human rights, and cultural affinity with the West are important to prevent a radicalization of Islamic politics in the region. An important ally in this regard is Turkey. The U.S. should support Turkey's bid for membership in the European Union. Turkish efforts have been sidetracked by the Europeans because of Ankara's crackdown on the Kurds last year. Washington should urge the Europeans to refrain from rejecting Turkish Westernizers and pushing the Turks into the hands of militant Islamists.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<li><b> Support the Western oil route through Turkey to reduce oil transportation hazards in the Bosphorus Straits.</b> As an important U.S. ally and founding NATO member, Turkey has raised serious concerns regarding tanker exports of Eurasian oil through the narrow and twisting Bosphorus Straits. Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, would be endangered by the nonstop tanker traffic the exports of vast new quantities of Eurasian oil would require. 
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Straits today are one of the busiest maritime passages in the world. The shipping of more oil from Eurasia would clog the already crowded waterway. Recent accidents involving burning tankers prove that Turkish concerns are justified. Free access to shipping via the Straits was envisaged in the 19th century, when the volume of traffic was twenty times lower than today. Therefore, the safest (and cheapest) route for Eurasian oil, which is preferred by Western oil companies, is a large pipeline from the Caucasus via Turkey to the Eastern Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The struggle for Eurasian oil is a multifaceted game. It involves security, geopolitical, and economic interests not only Russian and Eurasian, but American and Western as well. In Russia, nothing less than democracy is at stake. If Russia pursues a cooperative engagement with the West in the Caucasus, it will strengthen its economic and political integration with the West. However, if it chooses to challenge the West and reverts to its old imperial ways, Moscow likely will become increasingly hostile toward the West in other areas as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The oil and gas reserves of the Caucasus and Central Asia are vital to Western geostrategic and economic interests in the 21st century. They have the potential to secure prosperity and economic growth bolstered by low oil prices. In addition, these resources are key to ensuring revenues and, with them, the sovereignty of the Newly Independent States. In addition, the wealth brought by oil can fuel both economic and democratic development in the Caucasus and Central Asia, fostering the independence and freedom of countries which serve in turn as an obstacle to potential Russian imperial expansion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Russian military and political establishment is attempting to impose a sphere of influence on the CIS and secure control of the region's oil. If a hardliner wins the Russian presidential elections in June 1996, these efforts may redouble. A major campaign to assert influence in the Russian "near abroad" would be a setback for U.S. interests. In addition, control of the Caucasus and Central Asia would allow Russia geographical proximity to, and closer cooperation with, the anti-Western regimes in Tehran and Baghdad. Together, an anti-Western Russia, Iran, and Iraq, if they desired, could pursue a common interest in driving up the price of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To counter this prospect, the U.S. and the West need to convince the Russians to approach the oil question in Eurasia as an economic, not geopolitical, opportunity. The U.S. should reassure Russia that its companies will be included in future economic ventures in the region. Russian companies alone do not have the technological and financial resources to develop the hydrocarbon reserves of Eurasia. They will need Western oil companies to do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To become richer, Russia needs American and Western help. To foster peace and stability in Eurasia, America needs Russian help. A <i>modus vivendi</i> can be reached only if Russia accepts that the principles of free markets, democracy, and state sovereignty take precedence over the outdated geopolitical practices of the past century.

<title>Clinton Is Bypassing the Senate on the ABM Treaty -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>CLINTON IS BYPASSING THE SENATE ON THE ABM TREATY</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 266<br>
December 15, 1995<br>
<p>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 867, "Removing the ABM Treaty Obstacle to U.S. and 
Soviet Defenses Against Missiles," November 15, 1991.)
<p>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
The Clinton Administration has reached a "framework agreement" with Russia to resolve two long-
standing disputes over the future and scope of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) 
Treaty.<sup>1 </sup>  The ABM Treaty all but bars the United States from deploying defenses 
against long-range ballistic missiles. The agreement with Russia would do two things: 
<p><ol>
<li>Name which republics of the now-defunct Soviet Union are subject to the treaty; and 

<li>Define a new dividing line between defenses against long-range missiles, which are subject to 
the ABM Treaty's restrictions, and defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. 
</ol><p>
The U.S. Constitution requires that the executive branch submit these new agreements to the Senate 
for its advice and consent. Failing to do so would be illegal.
<p>
Yet this is exactly what President Bill Clinton intends to do. The President wants the new 
agreement with Russia to be implemented as an "agreed statement" in the Standing Consultative 
Commission (SCC), a joint U.S.-Soviet committee established in 1972 to consult on the details of 
implementing the ABM Treaty. "Agreed statements" in the SCC do not require the consent of the 
Senate. In effect, the Clinton Administration is attempting to bypass the Senate, thereby 
circumventing its constitutional role in the ratification of international treaties. This is not only 
illegal; it is strategically unwise. The Senate needs to ensure that its constitutional prerogatives are 
preserved. It needs to take action to force the Clinton Administration to submit the U.S.-Russian 
agreement to the Senate for its advice and consent.
<p>

<b>The Framework Agreement with Russia</b>
<p>
While the official text of the framework agreement between the U.S. and Russia has not been made 
public officially, the press has published a classified version of it.<sup>2 </sup>  From public 
reports, it is clear that the agreement framework attempts to resolve two problems regarding the 
ABM Treaty. These problems have remained ever since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in December 
1991, which effectively nullified America's previous partner in the ABM Treaty -- the Soviet 
Union.
<p>
<b>Problem #1</b>: The first is designating which republics of the former Soviet Union would 
replace the U.S.S.R. as the new legally bound partners of the treaty. Press reports reveal that the 
Clinton Administration plans to "multilateralize" the treaty by designating several of the 15 former 
Soviet republics as the new treaty partners.<sup>3 </sup>  These republics would include Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, among others.
<p>
<b>Problem #2</b>: The second unresolved problem is to define a new line between defenses 
against long-range (strategic ballistic) missiles, which are subject to ABM Treaty restrictions, and 
defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. The original language in the text of the 
ABM Treaty is ambiguous. Article II both fails to define "strategic ballistic missiles" and Article VI 
fails to explain exactly when non-ABM systems are given an ABM capability or are tested in "an 
ABM mode."
<p>
The framework agreement would establish entirely new definitions for these systems. Any anti-
missile interceptor tested against a target missile with a velocity of 3.1 miles per second or higher 
and a range of 2,175 miles would be considered a defense against strategic (long-range) ballistic 
missiles. Therefore, such an interceptor would be subject to the treaty. Second, the agreement 
would impose a limit on the speed of interceptors. If the interceptor speed is 1.9 miles per second or 
less, it would not be regarded as a treaty-limited, strategic defense system. An interceptor with a 
speed in excess of 1.9 miles per second would be presumed to be a strategic defense interceptor and 
thus subject to the ABM Treaty. 
<p>
In addition, the framework agreement includes a number of "confidence-building measures."  One 
would be to impose restrictions on the number and location of defenses against shorter-range 
missiles deployed by the U.S. The purpose would be to ensure that short-range missile defenses 
cannot be used as interceptors against the long-range missiles deployed by Russia.
<p>
The new definitions and restrictions established in the framework agreement apparently are 
designed to kill the Navy Upper Tier system, a missile defense system the Navy is developing for 
use on cruisers. The Navy Upper Tier's interceptor, called the <i>Standard</i> missile, has a 
velocity of greater than 1.9 miles per second; therefore, it would be subject to ABM Treaty 
restrictions under the framework agreement. Since Article V of the ABM Treaty prohibits the 
development, testing, and deployment of interceptors on mobile platforms such as ships, the 
velocity for the <i>Standard</i> missile would have to be reduced to comply with the Treaty. This 
would weaken the capability of the missile, effectively making it less useful as a defense against 
ballistic missiles. 
<p>
Moreover, the confidence-building measures contained in the agreement would give the Russians 
and other countries a veto over where and in what numbers the Upper Tier ships may be deployed. 
The reason: The agreement requires the U.S. to provide assurances to its ABM Treaty partners that 
deployed defenses against short-range missiles will not pose a realistic threat to long-range 
missiles. But this means that Russia and other countries, not the U.S., will judge whether these 
deployments are a threat. If they feel threatened by U.S. defenses, they simply will veto America's 
deployment of the Upper Tier ships.
<p>
<b>Clinton Bypasses the Senate</b>
<p>
Anticipating that the Clinton Administration was likely to bypass the Senate with a new resolution 
on the ABM Treaty, Congress last year sought to ensure that an agreement with Russia and perhaps 
several other republics of the former Soviet Union would be subject to review by the Senate. 
Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337) 
states: "The United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the 
President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered 
pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution."
<p>
In the past, the Clinton Administration has argued that it could not pledge in advance to submit 
ABM Treaty agreements to the Senate because it could not know whether their content would 
warrant Senate review. Of course, the content of the agreement is now known, but the Clinton 
Administration still refuses to submit the agreement to the Senate. Instead, it rushed to a meeting of 
the Standing Consultative Commission, on December 4, in order to formalize the agreement with 
the Russians. All outward appearances indicate that the Administration intends to treat the 
agreement as an SCC "agreed statement" not subject to Senate review.
<p>
In short, the Clinton Administration apparently plans to present the Senate with a <i>fait 
accompli</i>. The President's advisors may try to argue that the Russian agreement does not 
substantively modify the ABM Treaty. But this would make a mockery of the law and the facts. 
The very first clause of the ABM Treaty begins by saying that "The United States of America and 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, hereinafter referred to as the Parties" will be subject to the 
treaty. Surely, striking the reference to the Soviet Union and replacing it with the names of as many 
as 12 countries substantively modifies the ABM Treaty.
<p>
Changing the names of the parties amounts to more than a formality. It could result in a 
fundamental change in the deployment restrictions of the treaty. A 1974 protocol to the treaty limits 
each side to one ABM site of 100 interceptors.<sup>4 </sup>  If 12 states are designated to replace 
the Soviet Union, each as a legal party to the treaty, then the ABM Treaty now would allow 12 
ABM sites on the territory where it previously allowed only one. Surely, adding 11 new ABM sites 
is a substantive change in the treaty.
<p>
Further, the SCC was designed to work as an implementation forum between two parties. 
Substantive arrangements for the functioning of the SCC must change if more than two states are 
participating. Under the new arrangement, the U.S. would face as many as 12 representatives on the 
other side of the table instead of one. One of those representatives is certain to be Russia. Most of 
the other countries in the SCC would likely be under the influence of Russia and might even form a 
voting bloc with Russia, thereby easily outvoting the U.S. in settling disputes. It would be absurd to 
argue that changing the SCC in this way is not substantive.
<p>

<b>What the Senate Should Do</b>
<p>
The impending actions by the Clinton Administration present the Senate with a challenge to its 
treaty-making authority. The Senate has political and legal tools at its disposal to confront the 
Clinton Administration's attempts to bypass it.
<p>
The political tool is to withhold Senate action on matters deemed important by the President until 
the agreement is submitted to the Senate. The logical targets of delay by the Senate would be other 
treaties, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II 
(START II), and, if the dispute carries on beyond next year, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty as well.<sup>5 </sup>  The Senate leadership should make it clear that it will not complete 
action on any of these treaties if the Administration tries to circumvent the Senate with its changes 
in the ABM Treaty.<sup>6 </sup>
<p>
The legal tool is for the Senate to pass a resolution calling on President Clinton to submit the 
framework agreement for the advice and consent of the Senate. Assuming Clinton refused, the 
Senate could instruct its Office of Legal Counsel to file suit against the Clinton Administration with 
the intent of barring implementation of an ABM Treaty agreement that does not have Senate 
approval. While the statute governing the operation of the Senate's Office of Legal Counsel does 
not expressly authorize initiating lawsuits on behalf of the Senate as an institution, it would be 
possible for the Senate leadership to authorize this action by adopting a Senate resolution. Further, 
an individual member of the Senate could file a similar suit on his or her own. It would be 
preferable, however, for the Office of Legal Counsel to file the suit and speak for the Senate as an 
institution.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The framework agreement which the Clinton Administration has reached with Russia, assuming it 
is formalized in the coming days, will have a profound impact on the nation's security. It will 
determine which countries become ABM Treaty partners, change the way the ABM Treaty 
functions, and impose new restrictions on U.S. programs for fielding defenses against both shorter-
range and long-range missiles. The voice of the Senate deserves to be heard on such important 
matters.
<p>
However, hearing the Senate's voice appears to be too inconvenient for the President. He is trying 
to bypass the Senate by changing the ABM Treaty on his own, without submitting his changes to 
the Senate for its advice and consent. This is patently illegal. The treaty-making powers vested in 
the Senate by the Constitution exist to protect the nation's security, not to suit the convenience of 
the Clinton Administration. The Senate should be prepared to fight to uphold both its 
responsibilities and the nation's security. The Administration's framework agreement on the ABM 
Treaty should be brought before the Senate for its advice and consent.

as for China, this is a critical relationship, one that will significantly shape the economic and 
strategic contours of the Asia-Pacific region. This is a region in which the United States has vital 
national interests at stake. Indeed, China's emergence as a great power, how it integrates into the 
international system or fails to do so, will be among the defining issues for the United States, for 
Asia, and for the international community for at least the first quarter of the next century. Our 
speakers today have played significant roles in the evolution and development of United States 
relations with China over the past 25 years. Looking ahead, their experience, both inside and 
outside the government, and their judgment should serve as useful and thoughtful guides in dealing 
with the challenges of the next century.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="free">CHAS FREEMAN</a>: Thank you very much, 
Jim. I'm going to go right into the subject of U.S.-China relations and a variety of issues that have 
arisen in those relations. 
 On one level, U.S.-China relations are flourishing. Economic interaction and cultural exchange are 
very healthy elements of Washington's relationship with Beijing, but political relations are deeply 
strained. They are drifting. The situation is highly unstable for several reasons which I will address. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent so-called summit meeting in New York between 
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton was a great success in the sense that the highest 
aspiration of both sides was to prevent further deterioration in their relations, and that objective was 
achieved. The meeting accomplished virtually nothing in positive terms and left many questions 
unresolved. Indeed, it may have inadvertently confirmed a Chinese view that the United States is 
indifferent to the fate of Taiwan. The Taiwan issue, which is the central issue in U.S.-China 
relations at the moment, continues to be one that the Administration does not wish to address, and 
which the Chinese are happy to see the United States neglect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is often stated in this city that the strain in U.S.-China relations 
on the political level is the product of some sort of succession crisis in Beijing, or of domestic 
difficulties in China. Neither proposition can stand up to scrutiny. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the succession has in fact occurred. One of Deng Xiaoping's 
great achievements is to be a Chinese leader who turned over to others responsibility for leading the 
country while he was still alive--something that is rare in Chinese history and which will be a great 
contribution to Chinese political culture if others emulate it in the future. There are differences 
between leaders in Beijing just as there are differences in every capital between political leaders 
(we've just had an illustration of that in this city), but to describe this as a power struggle in terms of 
the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s is a gross overstatement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second issue that is cited is the four difficulties that China 
faces domestically, which some would call crises. I do not call them crises because they are not 
urgent; nor are they impossible to resolve. But there are four major difficulties facing the new 
Chinese government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first is a spiritual or ideological vacuum. The Chinese people 
are cynical about ideology, and nationalism alone now serves as a strong force for Chinese unity. 
Nationalism is not a congenial principle in terms of management of difficult issues like the Taiwan 
question.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second problem is the pattern of Chinese economic 
development, which has rested on bureaucratic entrepreneurship. When bureaucrats buy and sell 
things, people buy and sell bureaucrats. In other words, corruption is the inevitable result. From the 
point of view of the Chinese populace, corruption is probably the central issue in Chinese politics at 
present. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The third problem is the lack of definition of relationships between 
the center and the provinces. This is not a crisis; things work. Thirteen percent economic growth for 
the last three years or so is not bad by any standard; it was 10 percent for the previous decade. Yet 
the center is trying to do things which it is incapable of doing, and the provinces are trying to do 
things which they are incapable of doing. The result is confusion and a measure of unpredictability 
about decisions that are important in economic and political terms. This is an issue which must be 
addressed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The final problem, I believe, is in the context of rising nationalism 
and an inadequate structure for civilian control of the military. I will leave that for a later 
discussion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; These factors do have an influence on U.S.-China bilateral 
relations, but it is not the decisive influence. Let me simply make an obvious point. China now 
enjoys its best relations in history with most of the world's great powers. The relationship between 
China and Russia is the most equal and healthy that it has been in two centuries. Relations between 
China and the great powers of Europe--including Britain, where differences over Hong Kong have 
recently been set aside; Germany, which is actively courting China; and France, which after some 
difficulties over the Taiwan question has returned to the good graces of Beijing--are all as good as 
they have ever been in this century. Relations between China and Japan, due to careful management 
by both sides, have not been troubled as they were in the past. They are probably the best that they 
have been in many, many years. Relations with India are the best since the 1950s. Only the United 
States is an exception. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we look for why this is the case, perhaps we should look not in 
Beijing, but here. American relations with Japan and Britain are the least cordial and effective they 
have been since World War II. Relations with Germany are the least intimate they have been since 
the 1950s. Relations with France are the most strained they have been since the early 1960s. U.S. 
relations with Russia are deeply troubled, and relations with India still fall far short of their 
potential. So perhaps we should ask why China should be the exception in U.S. foreign relations, 
rather than looking for explanations inside China. Nevertheless, the fact is that U.S.-China relations 
have taken some very hard knocks over the past five or six years. Remember how this relationship 
began. It began at the outset of the 1970s, based on a common strategic concern with Soviet 
expansionism. It rested on several principles. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first was to pursue, first, strategic dialogue and later, after 
1979's normalization agreement, strategic cooperation. The second was to live and let live in terms 
of ideological differences and the differences between the two societies' cultural and social 
traditions. Mutual tolerance rather than mutual harping and criticism were agreed. We set aside 
regional differences--even major ones about the Vietnam War at the beginning of the 1970s--in 
order to pursue these larger interests in cooperation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This relationship also entailed a series of very delicate 
compromises on the issue of Taiwan. These centered on American acknowledgment, and then 
recognition, of the principle that there was only one China and that Taiwan is part of China. In the 
first instance, this was a common belief in Taipei and Beijing. In the normalization communiqu‚, it 
was the position of the Chinese government recognized by the United States. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This principle of managing relations with Taiwan found expression 
in three communiqu‚s. Let me review those briefly. The Shanghai Communiqu‚ of 1972 
abandoned U.S. policies of containment towards China and reached a compromise on the Taiwan 
issue, taking the United States out of the middle of the Chinese civil war while expressing the 
expectation and hope that the Chinese parties concerned on either side of the strait would work out 
a peaceful solution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Normalization Communiqu‚ replaced the strategic dialogue 
initiated in the Shanghai Communiqu‚ with strategic cooperation. It strengthened the U.S. formula 
with regard to Taiwan, acknowledging the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China and that 
there is only one China. It recognized Beijing as the site of the only legal Chinese government and 
traded form for substance in U.S. relations with Taiwan so that the United States--within the 
context of recognizing one China and Taiwan as part of China--would be able to maintain 
economic, cultural, and other unofficial ties with the people of Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In August of 1982, the tacit normalization understandings about 
arms sales to Taiwan were made explicit and strengthened. China acknowledged that U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan would continue, and the U.S. agreed to cap the quality of those arms sales and to 
reduce them step by step, leading over time to a final resolution of the dispute. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is the history. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the Chinese perspective, the United States has now strayed 
from or explicitly violated every one of the undertakings that I have just cited. This is the core of 
the problem from Beijing's point of view. From the American point of view, I would say, events 
from 1989-1991 destroyed the agreement to set aside ideology in the interest of strategic 
cooperation and replaced tolerance with strident criticism of Chinese human rights practices and an 
ideological confrontation, which has continued. These events then destroyed the strategic triangle. 
The Soviet Union itself -- the common enemy--disappeared. At the same time, Taiwan began to 
withdraw from the consensus it had previously enjoyed with Beijing, that it was part of China and 
that the division of China was an unnatural state of affairs which time and dialogue should repair. 
And, finally, over this period, the United States abandoned an effort we had conducted for 15 years 
to integrate China into global institutions. Increasingly, global institutions were crafted with China 
on the outside. That was the case with the Missile Technology Control Regime. It was the case with 
the Australia Group. More recently, it is the case with the successor to COCOM -- the New Forum. 
We thus have guaranteed that these global regimes will be a source of friction in U.S.-China 
relations. China will not be bound by rules that it did not participate in crafting. Frankly, none of 
these regimes can work because they exclude one of the principal actors with regard to their subject 
matter. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn now to the present and close. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This drift and the absence of consensus on a strategic framework 
for the relationship, the absence of strict adherence by either side to understandings that have been 
reached, and the emergence of a strong drive in Taiwan for a separate international identity have 
come together to produce the collapse of mutual confidence and trust. They have engendered 
Chinese effort to deal with the Taiwan issue separately from the United States. In the late spring, 
the Chinese saw Lee Teng-hui come here and Lien Chan (the Prime Minister) go to Europe. They 
saw an offer of a billion dollars to the United Nations for a separate seat for Taiwan. They 
interpreted these things as a major offensive by Taiwan against the status quo, and a breaking of the 
tacit modus vivendi which had preserved peace in the Taiwan Strait. Their response has been 
somewhat erratic but has settled down into the following pattern. You might call this <i>xuan ying 
jian shi</i> -- soft and hard policies simultaneously applied.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the hard policy. It is clear that in the summer the People's 
Liberation Army received authorization to use force against Taiwan to re-impose a <i>modus 
vivendi</i> in the Taiwan Strait. Of the series of exercises to be conducted, two of six known to be 
scheduled have already been carried out. One is apparently about to begin. These exercises are not 
an empty show of force. They are a campaign of military intimidation which could, and may well 
as the coming year unfolds, extend into the actual outbreak of combat in the Taiwan Strait and even 
strikes against Taiwan targets. This campaign of pressure will continue until Taiwan returns to the 
<i>modus vivendi</i> from which it strayed over the preceding year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the soft side, at the same time that this pressure is being 
applied, the PRC has escalated indications of flexibility in terms of reunification. Without getting 
into detail, I can say that Beijing has very clearly signaled to Taiwan that many things which had 
previously seemed non-negotiable are now up for negotiation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the point of view of the United States, which had hoped that 
the Taiwan issue was behind us, this is a most unfortunate set of developments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are many people in Taiwan who are convinced that the 
United States has a commitment to come to Taiwan's aid in the event that its actions provoke 
conflict with the mainland. They are not correct. There is no such commitment, and Taipei should 
not bank on such American steadfastness in pursuit of objectives that the United States has not 
endorsed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing for its part contains many people, including senior 
members of the Chinese military, who are convinced that the United States will not intervene in the 
Taiwan Strait or come to Taiwan's assistance in the event of conflict arising. These people, too, are 
mistaken. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They base their conclusions on the following factors: first, that the 
United States is legally stopped from intervening in Chinese internal affairs and that Taiwan is a 
matter of Chinese internal affairs: second, that the American performance in Bosnia and in Somalia 
demonstrates a lack of resolve which would also be played out in the Taiwan Strait; and third, that 
while Taiwan is a vital interest of China which the Chinese explicitly state they are willing to 
sacrifice millions of people and entire cities to manage, it is not such an interest for the United 
States. Nor is the United States prepared to make comparable sacrifices. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is not a happy situation. In a legal sense, the Taiwan issue 
may well be a matter of Chinese internal affairs--that is not something I wish to dispute -- but in a 
strategic sense, it is anything but a local matter. The implications of conflict in the Taiwan Strait 
reach well beyond the immediate region of Greater China in two senses. First, I believe it is true 
that the region sometimes called Greater China -- that is, the region of "Straits China," the region 
from Shanghai to Hong Kong, including Taiwan -- will determine the future of China. The future of 
China will determine the future of the Asia-Pacific region. I believe it is most likely that the future 
of the Asia-Pacific region will determine the future of the world, at least for the next century or two. 
Second, if there is conflict in the Taiwan Strait the United States will indeed have to make a 
decision about whether we intervene or don't. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't intervene, I believe the strategic consequences are 
enormous. The United States has no intrinsic strategic interest in Taiwan, but we do have an interest 
derived from our responsibility for the strategic defense of Japan. That interest, plus his ideology of 
anti- communism, is what led MacArthur in 1949 and early 1950 to dissent from the Truman 
Administration's decision to let the People's Liberation Army conquer Taiwan without opposition. 
He sat in the imperial army headquarters in Tokyo. Like everyone before him who had sat there 
from the time of the Meiji restoration, he saw the strategic importance of Taiwan to Japan's defense. 
Therefore, when Kim Il-Sung attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, the Seventh Fleet was 
interposed in the Taiwan Strait for two purposes: to prevent the spread of the Korean War and the 
outbreak from its existing borders of the Sino-Soviet bloc and, second, to discharge American 
responsibilities for the strategic defense of Japan. If the United States did not come to Taiwan's aid, 
and if we do not manage the Taiwan question in a suitable manner, Japan will feel betrayed. This is 
not simply a matter of strategic betrayal. It has emotional overtones. There are many people in 
Taiwan who have fond feelings for Japan and many in Japan who have fond feelings for those 
Taiwanese. This is rather unusual in Asia. In fact, Taiwanese are by far the most admiring of 
Japanese among Asians. This is a close emotional relationship. If Japan cannot count on the United 
States to defend its strategic interests, it must do so itself. That means Japan must assume 
responsibility for its own defense. That is Japanese rearmament. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the United States does come to Taiwan's assistance in the event 
of conflict, we must use bases in Japan to do so. That will pose a terrible dilemma for the Japanese 
government. One strategic imperative of Japanese policy is to avoid a hostile relationship with the 
mainland of China. It would have to choose between that strategic imperative on the one hand and 
its interest in maintaining the U.S. alliance and its strategic interest in Taiwan on the other. I believe 
Japan would choose the United States and Taiwan. I also believe no future Japanese government 
would ever be willing to be put in a position again in which foreigners made such a momentous 
strategic decision for Japan. The result in this case would be rearmament, but at a slower pace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So whether the United States chose to intervene or not, whether the 
PRC succeeded in bringing Taiwan within its orbit or not, the Taiwan issue has the potential to 
overthrow the entire Asian-Pacific strategic balance: not simply to poison U.S.-China relations for 
decades, but also to break the U.S.-Japan alliance and to reignite rivalry between Japan and China, 
with all of the implications in terms of an Asian pattern of containment of China that this might 
itself set off. Therefore, I believe the drift in U.S.-China relations, the failure of the United States 
and China to manage the Taiwan issue, and the very rash actions which Taipei has been taking are a 
great danger to the peace and security of the East Asian and Western Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="hard">HARRY HARDING</a>: It's a great pleasure 
to be here this morning, and especially to see so large an audience, containing people every bit as 
knowledgeable about China as the four of us on this panel. The size of the crowd is not only a 
tribute to the convening power of <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> and his 
colleagues at The Heritage Foundation, but also an indication of the widespread interest in China's 
growing role in world affairs. As Chas Freeman has just said, China will be the determining factor 
in the future of the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chas's remarks have focused on the Taiwan issue. I want to look 
more broadly at the U.S.-China relationship, organizing my comments around three headings. First 
of all, I will suggest why we have legitimate cause for concern about the future of China. Second, 
however, I will argue equally fervently that we should not exaggerate our concern about China, but 
should keep the rise of China in perspective. And finally, I'll draw the implications for American 
policy. I'll suggest that neither of the two policy alternatives most usually discussed--containment 
and engagement -- is a fully adequate or appropriate strategy for dealing with China in the decades 
ahead. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Why are we concerned about the rise of China?  Different people 
will give you different answers to this question. Some would stress China's domestic 
circumstances: that it remains a Communist country, or that it is not yet democratic. My concern is 
more with China's international behavior, and with the nature of the international community 
surrounding China. I can summarize my concern in the following four points:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First of all, we are concerned because we are seeing a dramatic 
increase in China's national capabilities, both its economic capabilities and, at least potentially, its 
military capabilities. We see rapid economic growth, we see significant increases (at least in 
nominal terms) in the official Chinese military budget, and we see a commitment to acquire force 
projection capabilities. We also know from the historical record that China is willing to use force to 
achieve its national objectives, even when others might argue that the odds are against it or that it is 
not fully rational in doing so.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, we realize that China is not a status quo power. It is a 
demandeur both regionally and, to a degree, globally. Its most obvious demands involve its 
territorial claims, most notably to the South China Sea and to Taiwan. It is also clear that China 
seeks major power status and the acknowledgment of that status by others. It seeks to expand its 
influence in the institutions and forums that make decisions economically and strategically for the 
region and the world. China's ambitions are being fueled by rising nationalism. This is not just an 
elite-sponsored nationalism; indeed, I do not yet see any concerted attempt by the Chinese 
government to fan the flames of nationalism. Instead, this is largely a popular nationalism, 
emerging among young people and urban intellectuals, many of whom we might have supposed 
were predisposed to the United States and to the West. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, China is not proving to be fully cooperative in various 
international regimes and relationships, both multilateral and bilateral. It is very skeptical about 
non-proliferation regimes, about arms control and disarmament regimes (especially in the nuclear 
field), about environmental regimes, about many global and regional economic regimes, and about 
some of the bilateral trade agreements that it has undertaken with the United States.
<p.
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the environment surrounding China, a very important 
determinant of any country's international behavior, is not entirely stable. There are long-term 
uncertainties about the balance among the major powers in the region, and about their political 
relationships. There are important potential flash points around China's periphery, including the 
Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and Indochina more generally. Key 
countries that are strategically important to China have uncertain domestic futures, particularly 
Burma, Cambodia, Mongolia, and North Korea. The collapse or the fragmentation of these 
countries could produce pressures or opportunities for Chinese intervention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But while all of these developments are grounds for concern, I 
want to emphasize that alarmist thinking is not warranted at this point. The Chinese make a 
distinction between <i>guanxin</i>, which means to be concerned about something, and 
<i>danxin</i>, which means to be very worried about something. My attitude towards China 
currently is much more one of concern than it is one of alarm. This is because each of the four 
points I've mentioned requires immediate qualification. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, let me return to China's capabilities. It is very dangerous to 
make the kind of straight-line long-term forecasts that figure so prominently in the discussion of 
China's future here in the United States. Although the Chinese may not be facing an acute or 
immediate crisis along any of the four dimensions that Chas Freeman identified, it is facing chronic 
problems that are potentially extremely serious. Indeed, one discovers that as one travels around the 
periphery of China, other Asian countries are at least as concerned about China's long-term 
weakness as they are about its long-term strength. Or, to put it differently, they are as worried about 
the unconventional security threats that would come from collapse as much as they are concerned 
about the more conventional security threats that would come from strength. In contrast, the 
analysis of China in the United States has not yet fully come to grips with the challenges to China's 
continued economic and social success in the middle to long term.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With regard to the military more specifically, to say that China is 
increasing its nominal military budget and is seeking to acquire force projection capabilities does 
not mean that China is in a position immediately to attain this kind of modern military force. China 
remains far behind the United States and other major powers technologically, and will remain so for 
many years. While we should monitor China's military preparations very carefully, I don't think we 
should overreact to them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, although China is not a status quo power, it also is not a 
revolutionary power or even a power that seeks major changes in the international system. In the 
1960s, China was exactly that: a revolutionary power that sought to overthrow every single major 
international institution from the United Nations to the World Bank and to promote revolutionary 
insurgencies throughout the Third World. Today, in contrast, China does not seek to undermine 
international institutions, but rather to expand its role within them, just as a claimant to major 
power status might be expected to do. Although this is a matter of some concern, it is not as 
threatening to the international community as is the behavior of truly revolutionary powers that 
regard the international structure as fundamentally illegitimate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, with regard to China's willingness to cooperate, I'm editing 
a volume on the patterns of cooperation in China's international conduct, which I hope will appear 
in print sometime next year. The basic thesis of the book is that, although China is by no means 
fully cooperative in international affairs, it has become increasingly cooperative over the last 150 
years. Chinese leaders have come to understand that they need cooperative international interaction 
to achieve their domestic and foreign objectives. They are therefore increasingly willing to work 
within international institutions and to forge cooperative relationships with other countries. The 
pattern of China's behavior--albeit more in the economic realm than in the security sphere--has 
increasingly been to accept the strictures of the international community. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, although the environment surrounding China is not 
entirely tranquil, still, in comparison with other regions, the Asia-Pacific region is one of the most 
vibrant and stable in the world. There are no power vacuums into which China can easily expand. 
There is a good chance of dealing constructively with the flashpoints and unstable countries around 
China's periphery. So the situation today is very different from the situation that confronted the last 
aspirant to major power status in Asia, namely Japan in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, Japan 
faced a China in collapse and a number of European colonies in Asia at a time of European 
retrenchment. That was obviously a much more unstable and less vibrant international environment 
than we see in Asia today. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn finally to the third section of my remarks, about the 
implications for U.S. policy. I'm not satisfied with any of the three major alternatives which have 
been put out on the table in recent years. The first of these is one that I didn't even mention in my 
introductory remarks because, fortunately, it has begun to fall out of favor: a policy of fragmenting 
China, encouraging its breakup into its constituent regions and provinces. There's an internal 
contradiction in that policy that I've never been able to fully understand. If China were really so 
weak that we could cause it to break apart, then why would it pose such a threat to American 
security that a policy of fragmentation would be warranted?  Moreover, a policy of fragmentation 
would be guaranteed to ignite precisely the kind of Chinese nationalism that it is in our interest to 
avoid. And even if we were successful in catalyzing China's disintegration, the fragmentation of 
that country would be an extremely messy process that would have security consequences very 
detrimental to the interests of the United States and its allies. So a policy of fragmentation fails, 
with regard both to the end that it pursues and to the means that it entails.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Containment is, of course, the policy that is more frequently 
presented these days as an alternative to the Clinton Administration's approach. In my judgment, 
the analysis of China's intentions and capabilities that I have presented does not warrant a strategy 
of containing Chinese influence or seeking to hamper China's rise to major power status. Were we 
to do so at this point, we would find ourselves engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy, creating a 
hostile China. In addition, we would find that no other Asian government -- not Japan, not South 
Korea, not Southeast Asia, not even Taiwan or Vietnam -- would join us in this undertaking. So we 
would be taking on China absolutely alone, condemning ourselves to an adversarial relationship 
with China and therefore to a second Cold War. If it's necessary, a containment policy can, of 
course, be adopted later. But it is by no means an optimal choice for the United States, and it is 
neither necessary nor desirable for us to select this strategy under present circumstances. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alternative that the Clinton Administration puts forward is the 
policy known as "comprehensive engagement."  There are several problems with this strategy. One 
is that the key word, "engagement," has so many different meanings that it is very difficult to 
explain it to anyone else. It could denote, for example, a betrothal or an agreement to get 
married--certainly not what it means in this particular case. It could mean a military battle, which is 
what many Chinese believe that it means. Or it can mean a meshing of gears or a process of 
dialogue and interaction, which is what the Clinton Administration wants it to mean. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But even if we go beyond the semantic confusion that surrounds 
the term "engagement," we find that it refers to process without substance. Our engagement with 
China is guided by what vision, and directed at what objectives?  In the end, the concept of 
engagement is an empty one. It refers to dialogue and interaction but does not give a clear sense of 
what American objectives are. As short-sighted and ill-conceived as they are, at least the concepts 
of fragmentation and containment tell you very clearly what American goals towards China would 
be. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So what's the alternative?  Well, I've never been a good phrase-
maker, and I'm not entirely satisfied with the word that I will put forward. But I would recommend 
a policy of integration: attempting to integrate China into an increasingly vibrant community of 
nations in the Asia-Pacific region in which the United States is also an active participant. In other 
words, our policy should be to encourage the expansion of China's bilateral political and economic 
ties with its neighbors and its active and responsible participation in the emerging economic and 
security institutions that are being established in the Asia-Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, people in the Clinton Administration might well say that that 
is what they mean by "engagement," even though they don't spell out their objectives quite so 
clearly. But I think there are some significant differences between a policy of engagement and a 
policy of integration. First of all, by talking of integrating China into a regional community, we 
immediately put our policy in a multilateral setting and not just a bilateral one. A policy of 
integration implies that we work together with our friends and allies in the Asia-Pacific region to 
enmesh China in a system of mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral institutions. In short, 
whereas engagement is an essentially bilateral strategy, integration is inherently multilateral, 
although successfully managing the bilateral relationship between China and the United States 
would be a prerequisite for its success. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, a policy of integration would require us to identify our 
common interests with China more clearly, as well as to delineate our concerns about Beijing, 
something that the Clinton Administration has still not fully done. We might say that we welcome 
China's emergence as a major actor in the international economy, including its ability to export to 
other countries, but that we are also asking that China open up its own markets to trade and 
investment from other countries, including the United States. We could make clear that we 
welcome China's growing prosperity, which is good both for the Chinese people and for the rest of 
the world, but that, at the same time, we are concerned about the environmental consequences of 
Chinese industrialization. We should indicate that we acknowledge China's right to national 
security and to a reasonable defense establishment, but that we are very concerned about the 
possibility that China's growing military capability could be destabilizing to the Asia-Pacific 
region, especially when not conducted in a transparent way. And we could say that we respect the 
desire of both the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people for political stability, but that we believe 
that genuine stability can be achieved better through a process of gradual and sustained political 
reform than through repression alone. That kind of statement, identifying both our common 
interests and our differences with the Chinese, would be an important element of an integration 
policy. Such a statement of American objectives has generally been absent from the articulation of 
our engagement policy thus far. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, because of its multilateral dimension, a policy of 
integration alerts us to the importance of not just having a clear strategy towards China, but also 
promoting the stability and vitality of the region as a whole. Security threats are not produced 
simply by the rise of an ambitious or irresponsible major power. Rather, they are created by the rise 
of such a power in an international environment that provides it with either nettlesome provocation 
or easy opportunities. It's therefore very important for us and our friends in the region to maintain 
an international environment that sends a very clear signal to the Chinese: 
<p><ul>
<li>We welcome you into our international community on mutually beneficial terms.
<p>
<li>We are not going to do things that impinge upon your vital national interests. 
<p>
<li>We are not going to create easy opportunities for you to take unfair advantage of. 
<p>
<li>If you attempt to take unreasonable advantage of those opportunities, you will find that the 
community will come together to resist your encroachments and that it has both the resources and 
the political will to do so.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So in sum, although this policy of integration is obviously closer to 
engagement than it is to either containment or fragmentation, I think there are three differences: It 
positions the United States as part of an Asia-Pacific community seeking to integrate China, rather 
than focusing so narrowly on our bilateral ties with Beijing; it identifies our common interests with 
the Chinese, as well as the areas in which we differ; and it places as much emphasis on managing 
the regional setting surrounding China as on trying directly to influence Chinese thinking and 
behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="feld">HARVEY FELDMAN</a>: I am not nearly as 
apocalyptic as Chas and I fear probably not as brief as Harry, so I hope you will bear with me, 
particularly because I want to examine the Taiwan leg of this triangular relationship between 
Washington, Beijing, and Taipei in a way that we haven't quite come to grips with yet. And the first 
thing I have to say is that it seems to me that for some 50 years now, our China and Taiwan policies 
have been built upon an interlocked set of confusions and misperceptions. From 1950 to 1979, we 
took the position that China's legal government somehow was lodged in Taipei. Since 1979 we 
have genuflected to Beijing's position that it is also the government of Taiwan. Each of these 
stances is as totally unrealistic as the other. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Chas pointed out, successive administrations have said that our 
China and Taiwan policies are based on the three communiqu‚s which he enumerated: Shanghai 
'72, the Recognition Communiqu‚ '78, and the August 17, 1982, communiqu‚ decreasing arms 
sales to Taiwan, plus something called the Taiwan Relations Act. There are substantial 
contradictions among these documents and an even more basic misunderstanding of what they 
mean in their legal effect. The three communiqu‚s are policy statements by the Nixon, Carter, and 
Reagan Administrations. Although the Bush and Clinton Administrations also have adhered to their 
terms, the communiqu‚s are not a body of law, international or domestic. Embedded in them is the 
famous "one-China policy" so often cited to us by White House and State Department spokesmen 
and others as the rationale for a policy which seems so often to be irrational. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Recognition Communiqu‚ signed by Carter in '78 is the one-
China formula most often quoted: "the government of the United States of America acknowledges 
the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China."  This is a unilateral 
statement of position; it is not a treaty. Nor does it mean, despite what Chas has said, that the 
United States accepts the PRC position that Taiwan is a part of China. Had we said, for example, 
the government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that Mao 
Zedong sits on the right hand of God and has learned to brush his teeth, that wouldn't mean that we 
believed it. It would mean that we understand that is what the Chinese government believes to be 
the case. The acknowledgment formula is an elegant way of saying we hear you and we don't 
contradict you. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By contrast, the Taiwan Relations Act, Public Law 96-8 of April 
10, 1979, is the law of the land. It establishes a continuing relationship between the United States 
and Taiwan on an unofficial basis to "preserve and promote extensive close and friendly 
commercial, cultural and other relations."  It also states that the United States considers "any effort 
to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means including boycotts and embargoes 
is a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United 
States." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The language "threat to the peace and security of the Western 
Pacific area" was chosen by the Congress for a very specific reason. It replicates the language of 
Chapter Six, "peaceful settlement of disputes," and Chapter Seven, "action with respect to threats to 
the peace," of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, in a statement which is reminiscent of the 
former Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China, the Act goes on to say, "the president is 
directed to inform the Congress promptly of any threat to the security of the social or economic 
system of the people on Taiwan and any danger arising to the interests of the United States 
therefrom. The president and the Congress shall determine in accordance with Constitutional 
processes appropriate action by the United States in response to any such danger." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There can be no question that the TRA mandates a much closer 
relationship with Taiwan and with its people than is contemplated by the three communiqu‚s and, 
of course, a much closer relationship with Taiwan than the PRC has wanted us to have. From Carter 
on, administrations have been pressured by Beijing to ignore the plain meaning of the Taiwan 
Relations Act and to cut back on that relationship. In varying degrees, all have been willing to do 
so, reinterpreting the law to suit policy considerations and presumed economic interests. These 
contradictions were much easier to deal with when Taiwan was, like the mainland, a police state 
with all the apparatus of repression, the political prisoners and so on and so forth. Under those 
circumstances the pretensions of the government on Taiwan could be and were treated with a kind 
of amused contempt, and the United States concentrated on getting on with Beijing while still doing 
business with and admitting students from Taiwan. And, of course, the central core of this policy 
was the need to add China as a makeweight in the worldwide struggle with the Soviet Union. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But now the situation has changed. Not only is the Cold War over, 
but in a remarkably short period of time Taiwan has evolved into a full fledged democracy. It is no 
longer that authoritarian police state. In fact, for the first time in all four thousand years of Chinese 
history, there is a multiparty democracy, a free press, no political prisoners, a representative 
Parliament in which seats are contested at election time. And the major opposition party was 
recently given license to own and operate a television station. Next March, the head of state on 
Taiwan will be chosen by free popular vote, again something unique in Chinese history. Moreover, 
the division of national income on Taiwan is probably the most egalitarian in all of Asia and far 
more egalitarian than here in the United States. To top it all off, the government in Taipei no longer 
asserts any claim to be the legitimate government of all China. It takes the position that within the 
broad historic and cultural entity of China, there are now two governments, that each of them rules 
a defined territory, that each has all the attributes of sovereignty that entitle it to recognition. The 
government in Taipei points out that the government in Beijing has never since its founding on 
October 1, 1949, ruled Taiwan even for a single day. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So, under these circumstances, what should American policy be?  
Well, we're often given the mantra that goes: PRC is very, very large; PRC is a major military 
power; PRC is a growing economic power; PRC has a seat on the Security Council; Taiwan has 
none of those things. Therefore, the PRC is very, very important to us and Taiwan is not important 
at all, except perhaps, as Chas suggested, strategically in the case of Japan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I would make a different argument. Twenty-one million people, 
the population of Taiwan, is not an inconsiderable amount of people, unless you're comparing it 
with the population on the mainland. Twenty-one million people is, after all, the population of 
Australia plus New Zealand plus all the rest of the South Pacific combined. The PRC is much 
larger, but I don't know that size ought to be the criterion of American policy. If size were the 
criterion, we would have taken the part of Indonesia back in the Sukarno days when it was in 
confrontation with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. In fact, if size were the criterion, we 
would never have founded NATO because, after all, the Soviet Union was very, very large and had 
a very large army and a seat in the Security Council -- all the things that China has. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, policies should not be determined by size but by interests. 
We have a great many of these with the PRC, and they are often interests that deal with issues of 
global reach. We want PRC cooperation with the Security Council on non-proliferation matters and 
on specific problems of trade. In fact, the issues that we have on our China agenda are a great many 
indeed: PRC export of nuclear technology to Pakistan and perhaps to Iran; PRC shipments of 
missile components to Iran and perhaps Iraq; drug trans-shipment through Yunan; piracy of 
American intellectual property; the question of cooperation to restrain the North Korean drive to 
acquire nuclear weapons; export to the U.S. of prison-made goods; reneging on commitments to 
allow Red Cross visits to political prisoners; and, of course, the terms of entry into the World Trade 
Organization. This is without even getting into the question of PRC violation of the norms of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined by the United Nations Charter and by 
international instruments which the PRC itself has signed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The list is long and obviously contentious, but I have to say that 
the fact that it is long and contentious is not the result of American ill will. In almost every instance, 
everything that is on our agenda puts us in the position of asking Beijing either to make good on a 
promise which it had given us previously, to remain faithful to an international obligation which it 
voluntarily assumed, or to adhere to a standard agreed to by the international community at large. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From Beijing's point of view, of course, we look like an obnoxious 
bill collector who comes knocking at their door at all kinds of awkward times. But, in fact, the bills 
are important and the debts were honorably incurred. It's hard for me to take seriously the argument 
of some who say that by asking the PRC leadership to make good on these promises that they've 
given, and to live up to the agreements they have signed, we are convincing them that we have 
become a hostile power adopting a policy of containment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We've often been told that how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is going to directly affect how the PRC responds to that specific agenda and, therefore, we 
have no choice but to reject Taiwan's hopes for better treatment at our hands because we need the 
PRC. We need the PRC, goes the litany, and we don't need Taiwan. Therefore, in the larger 
interests of regional stability and world peace, we have to take account of Beijing's sensitivities, and 
especially those sensitivities that concern Taiwan. But it seems to me that the claim that PRC 
behavior on regional and world issues is conditioned by how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is simply farfetched. How we deal with Taiwan will certainly affect our relationship with 
Beijing. It may mean that things might get pretty cold. But Beijing sold nuclear technology and 
missiles to Iran long before Lee Teng-hui was admitted to the United States to speak to an alumni 
group at Cornell. The PRC's claim that the entire South China Sea is their territorial water has 
nothing to do with Lee Teng-hui's visit or our sale of F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact of the matter is, the policy Beijing adopts with regard to 
any of the items on our agenda responds to their view of their interests and, of course, to the 
exigencies of their own domestic and factional politics. Now I don't mean to suggest that their 
views are unimportant. They obviously are important. Nor do I mean to suggest that we should 
break off dialogue. Obviously, we want to continue. But there is no reason for us not to press our 
own interests with persistence and without hesitation, because they are our interests, and we should 
do so without any apology, no matter whether they refer to the Korean Peninsula, the South China 
Sea, the Philippines, or even Taiwan. I have never believed that we need or should take the view 
that a fruitful Washington-Beijing relationship has to be more important to us than it has to be to 
the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I want to point out that we do have interests in Taiwan as well, 
though they are not on the macro world level. About a million Americans have roots in that island. 
It is our fifth, perhaps sixth trading partner. But probably most important of all, it is an example of a 
one-time police state, a Chinese police state at that, that has transformed itself into a democracy. 
This is something that we should value, something we should want maintained, something that we 
should want maintained before the eyes of the Chinese people on the mainland because our and the 
world's interests would be enhanced if that example were imitated on the mainland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as the strategic element is concerned, given PRC behavior in 
the South China Sea, I cannot conceive that it would be in our interest to have the PRC control both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait as well as the waters of the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the 
Philippines. This doesn't mean that we have to support Taiwan's claims or become its sponsor on 
the international scene. But I think it does mean that we should treat it with dignity and with a 
seriousness that its accomplishments deserve. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Public Law 96-8, the Taiwan Relations Act, speaks in terms of 
unofficial cultural and commercial relations with Taiwan, so it seems to me there was no reason for 
us ever to have made a fuss about granting a visa to Lee Teng-hui to speak to an alumni group at 
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca is not the navel of the universe. Indeed, it seems to 
me it was the continuing insistence of the State Department that granting such a visa would destroy 
the basis of our one-China policy that created this scandal and its aftermath. If the State Department 
says giving the visa is going to destroy our one-China policy, what can Beijing say?  It can hardly 
say anything less. Let me point out that in the year before we granted that visa, the Prime Minister 
of Taiwan, Lien Chan, spoke at a graduation at the University of Chicago, which is his alma mater, 
and his Foreign Minister Chen Fo had visited the United States twice. Beijing said nothing about it 
either time. Why?  This was all done very, very quietly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think, with Beijing and with Taipei, we should do what our 
interests and our honor require of us. I think our honor requires that we not turn our back on the 
government that has transformed itself into a democracy, and our interest requires that there be no 
aggression in the Taiwan Strait. Here I have to say that deterrence is a very, very important factor, 
and I agree with Chas we have to tell the people on Taiwan that they cannot count on our assistance 
if they crudely provoke Beijing to action. But we also have to say to Beijing that they cannot 
conclude we would stand idly by in the event of invasion, boycott, or embargo, exactly as is stated 
in the Taiwan Relations Act. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as Taiwan's hopes to raise its international profile, I think 
there are things in our interest that we can and should do. We found it in our interest to help Taiwan 
back into the Asian Development Bank. Given the fact that Taiwan has a hundred billion dollars in 
foreign exchange reserves, I see no reason why we should not try to have Taiwan enter into some 
form of association with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World 
Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It's worth noting that Taiwan continued to be a 
member of the Bank and the Fund for nine years after it lost its General Assembly seat, making the 
point that you don't have to be a member of the General Assembly to be a member of the Bank and 
the Fund. It's also interesting to note that the PRC is that Bank's largest debtor. If Taiwan is willing 
to lend money to the PRC, I say let them do it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="sol">RICHARD SOLOMON</a>: This panel 
discussion has covered very rich and controversial material. Let me try to pull together some of the 
key points in terms of policy.
I should begin by saying that my political instinct--which over more than a dozen years of 
government work I've learned to trust--is that within a decade we are likely to be back in a military 
confrontation with the PRC. There are territorial and strategic issues of extreme importance to both 
the United States and the PRC that, without wise and engaged leadership, are very likely to impel 
us back in the direction of a confrontation. What I'll try to do here is to suggest there is a way to 
cope with these issues in a more constructive way than confrontation, but it does require a 
leadership commitment on both sides that I'm not sure is there. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The crisis in U.S.-PRC relations of this past summer ("mini-crisis" 
might be more appropriate) over a range of factors--the Lee Teng-hui visit, the Harry Wu 
case--played an important role in focusing our attention on issues related to the U.S.-China 
relationship that, frankly, we haven't paid much attention to. Since the Tiananmen suppression in 
the early summer of 1989, the United States has essentially been paralyzed on China policy. In one 
night of violence, as we all saw it on CNN, the political consensus in the United States for normal 
relations with the PRC was destroyed. It put the leadership in Beijing on the political defensive; it 
de-legitimized certain PRC leaders who were seen as responsible for the violence; and it made it 
very difficult to sustain a high-level dialogue between Washington and Beijing. As we all know, the 
secret Scowcroft trip to China in July of 1989, which was an effort to sustain a leadership dialogue, 
was roundly attacked in our domestic politics. And that has led to a situation where the ground rules 
for managing the U.S.-PRC relationship -- which were established during the Nixon Administration 
in the Shanghai Communiqu‚ and the two subsequent joint communiqu‚s on normalization in 1979 
and Taiwan arms sales in 1982 -- have now largely broken down.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think we also have to recognize that for the quarter of a century 
since President Nixon's visit to China in 1972, all the parties involved in this situation -- China, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States -- have really had a very good show. Everyone has benefited 
by the stability in the region induced by U.S.-PRC normalization. It has enabled China under Deng 
Xiaoping's reforms of late 1978 to make an economic takeoff that has put China on the path to 
national economic development for the first time since the early 19th century. The "self-
strengthening" effort late in that century failed with the collapse of the Ching dynasty, and there 
followed a century of foreign intervention and revolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The turmoil of that extended period prevented the Chinese from 
taking off economically in the way, for example, that Japan, the United States, and the nations of 
Europe did. So today, for the first time in that 150-year period, the Chinese have finally attained a 
high rate of sustained economic expansion. As you know, China today is growing at more than 10 
percent a year and is projected to become the largest aggregate economy in the world sometime in 
the second or third decade of the coming century.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taiwan has flourished as well since the early 1970s. In the 25 
years since the secret Henry Kissinger trip to Beijing, Taiwan's per capita income has gone up 
tenfold, from a little over twelve hundred dollars to ten times that today. They've attained the kinds 
of reforms that Harvey Feldman has noted and have done spectacularly well for themselves. Today, 
of course, their interest is in trying to protect their achievements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the United States, for the first time in over a century, we've 
benefited from good relations with all the major players in East Asia, especially Japan and China, at 
the same time. And our domestic economic growth has been fueled in large measure by exports to 
the booming Asia-Pacific economy. I call to your attention the just-released Heritage report on 
APEC, which identifies our substantial economic interests in the region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If everyone has benefited from the situation that grew out of the 
negotiation of the Shanghai Communiqu‚, out of U.S.-PRC normalization, why is this mutually 
beneficial situation now breaking down?  If everybody is doing so well, why do we have such 
unease about the future?  I think our presenters today have laid out the major factors. A major 
consideration is the end of the Cold War. The rationale of "the China card," as we came to call it, 
enabled us to push off the agenda our concerns with many Chinese activities that are now at the top 
of the agenda. The human rights issue is, of course, only one factor. U.S.-China trade has grown 
tremendously, and now we're concerned about the trade imbalance and Chinese trading practices. 
We are concerned about the impact on sensitive regions of Chinese arms sales abroad. And Taiwan 
wants to find some way to stabilize its autonomy and give greater legitimacy to its 
accomplishments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, how can we fix the situation?  Is it possible to reestablish a 
set of political ground rules that will reactivate the pattern of interactions that have been so 
beneficial to all of the players in the China equation for the last quarter century?  I believe this can 
be done, but it requires an active U.S. leadership role. We have to help craft a framework for all the 
players, but without being too out-in-front on issues that are freighted with strong nationalistic and 
territorial qualities for all the Chinese parties involved.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can we lead without being out in front?  As we see in President 
Clinton's cancellation of his November trip to APEC, our nation's leadership is preoccupied, for 
very good reasons, with domestic issues. It is difficult under normal circumstances to get our 
national leaders out to Asia. During my tenure at State, Secretary of State Baker spent only one 
night in Japan, as people will recall from criticism of that fact. Asia is a long way away, and our 
interests in the region compete in our political life with very complex domestic and international 
agendas, and to get Presidents, secretaries of state, and national security advisors out to the region is 
very difficult. I think President Clinton is due credit for elevating the yearly APEC meeting to the 
summit or heads-of-state level, but it is difficult to sustain a dialogue at that level. The question we 
face is whether we can focus our national attention on Asia, as we did over the summer because of 
all the tensions, in order to play the leadership role that we must play if we are to reset the political 
parameters on the sources of potential conflict in the region. To do so would serve our national 
interest in regional stability, but it's not easy to gain a claim on the attention of our national leaders 
in the absence of a crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't do it, the passivity and drift in leadership that was 
induced after Tiananmen, the paralysis in our domestic politics about dealing with China, is likely 
to lead to initiatives by others who will force our hand and heighten tension as they pursue their 
own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One issue that was not mentioned this morning, but which should 
be seen as another source of potential trouble with the PRC, is the recession of Hong Kong to 
Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 -- something that is part of Beijing's 19th century agenda as it 
enters the 21st century. Hong Kong, as you know, was wrested from the Chinese by the British in 
the early part of the 19th century, and it will soon return to Chinese control. There is great concern 
and interest here about how that process unfolds. A set of basic agreements for Hong Kong's 
recession was negotiated in the 1980s between Beijing and London. Heritage has put out a good 
summary of U.S. interests as they will be affected by the transition in Hong Kong to PRC sovereign 
control. I personally am rather pessimistic that Beijing will handle that transition in a way that will 
provide confidence that it is abiding by its agreements with the British. My expectation is that the 
way Beijing handles Hong Kong as it takes over control will give Taiwan little comfort about how 
its interests will be dealt with in any reunification arrangement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How do we try to reset some ground rules for the United States, 
the PRC, and Taiwan relations if the Shanghai Communiqu‚ and the other parameters of the U.S.-
PRC relationship are no longer working well?  No one wants to play the role that General George 
Marshall played in 1945. One of the basic presumptions about U.S.-China policy that evolved after 
the failure of the Marshall mission to mediate the Chinese civil war back in 1945-1946 was that we 
don't want to get caught in the middle as these two parties deal with their differences. Taiwan is 
viewed by Beijing as an internal issue, and they are not interested in having us play the role of 
mediator. Yet what happens across the Taiwan Strait is of great concern to the United States. It 
affects our national interests in very important ways--and not just economically. Remember that 
East Asia was the site of our last three major wars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Generally, we get into trouble, as we did in Korea in 1950, when 
we say we're not interested, when we don't pay attention. That leads others to say, "Well, if the 
Americans are not interested, then we'll pursue our own interests."  We have to lean forward, in my 
view, and indicate in more than just words that the peaceful resolution of these territorial and 
related issues is very much in the U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now what would be the objective of an American political 
initiative?  The core objective should be to make sure that the PRC-Taiwan situation does not 
become remilitarized. Beijing's missile tests and other military activities over the last six months or 
so have shown an inclination to remilitarize the Taiwan situation, which since the Shanghai 
Communiqu‚ Beijing has approached in a political framework. It is in our interest, and in Taiwan's, 
to see that Beijing handles the Taiwan issue in political terms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can it be done?  It seems pretty clear at the moment that the 
prospects for a successful negotiation across the Strait, which Beijing and Taipei have been 
pursuing for several years via the so-called Koo-Wong talks in Singapore, are not good. The 
question, I believe, is whether restraint will be shown on all sides, whether the deal that was struck 
between Kissinger and Chairman Mao will be sustained. In 1973, Mao told Kissinger that the 
United States and China had larger interests than a fight over Taiwan because of the Soviet 
challenge. "We don't need to resolve the Taiwan issue for a hundred years," said Mao. In effect, 
Mao was prepared to delay dealing with the issue far off into the future, as long as the United States 
supported the "one-China" principle, and to let circumstances evolve in ways that he would not be 
responsible for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Today, no Chinese leader seems prepared to compromise the 
country's 19th century agenda. While Mao put the issue on the shelf, it stands like a bookend at the 
outer limit of the country's politics. Beijing's recent military pressures on Taiwan raise the question 
of whether China's contemporary leaders are preparing to take the Taiwan issue off the shelf and 
seek a solution to their goal of reunification in the near term. This is not a question they totally 
control, but my impression, based on recent high-level discussions in Beijing, is that PRC leaders -- 
even the military -- say their first priority today is economic development.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, of course, their hope is that over the next 10 or 20 years they 
will sustain growth at 10 percent a year and acquire the accouterments of modern national power, 
including military power, and on that basis be in a stronger position to assert their various territorial 
and political claims.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I believe today there is still common interest among all the 
parties involved to maintain stability and focus on economic growth. The challenge for the United 
States is to re-engage in a quiet way the various parties involved in this situation to reestablish 
political parameters which will sustain the mutually beneficial situation that persisted for the past 
quarter of a century. This will require considerable restraint on the part of both the PRC and 
Taiwan. In the case of Beijing, their handling of the Hong Kong transition will be a major mood-
setter for Taiwan and could substantially degrade attitudes in the United States about the extent to 
which Beijing will honor its international agreements. This situation also requires restraint on 
Taiwan's part about how it will handle the autonomy-independence issue. From my recent visit to 
Taipei, I have the impression that responsible people are thinking seriously about how to define that 
set of issues in ways that are not a provocation to the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our own politics, since Tiananmen there has been a universal 
tendency to demonize the PRC. I would only note that our most recent ambassador to Beijing, 
Stapeleton Roy, says that much of the characterization of China in our domestic debate doesn't 
sound like the China that he lived in for four years. Having gone to China myself 25 or more times 
since the early 1970s, in terms of openness, social change, and economic transformation, what you 
see going on in that country is a set of developments which, if they are given sufficient time to play 
themselves out, are as likely to produce a China we can work with as they are a threatening China. 
But our tendency to demonize is very strong, and this may foreclose opportunities to deal 
constructively with Beijing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ultimately, the issue comes down to the Administration and 
presidential leadership. We have a capacity to engage all the players involved if it is done in the 
right way. But one of the foreign policy dilemmas we have in the post-Cold War world is that our 
domestic preoccupations make it very difficult for our national leaders to pay attention to loaded 
international issues that, if handled badly or allowed to drift, may well impose great costs on our 
country down the road.

<h2>The Contract With America: 
Implementing New Ideas in the U.S.</h2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerj.htm">Jeffrey B. Gayner</a><br>
[Jeffrey Gayner is a Senior Fellow at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation.</a>
 He spoke on October 12, 1995, at a conference in Athens, Greece, on "Beyond Statism: New 
Ideas." The conference was sponsored by the Athens-based Centre for Political Research and 
Information, a privately supported research institution that supports individualism and the free-
market economy.]
<p>

Decades from now, historians quite likely will reflect back upon the Contract With America as one 
of the most significant developments in the political history of the United States. As Newt 
Gingrich, the first Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives in 40 years, has written: 
"there is no comparable congressional document in our two-hundred-year history."
<p>
Never before had so detailed a document become such an integral part of a congressional election 
campaign; never had so many innovative ideas been drafted into legislation so quickly; and never in 
the previous six decades had so much legislation been passed by the House of Representatives in 
less than 100 days after the newly elected Members of Congress took office. As the chief political 
columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>, R. W. Apple, wrote in a front page news analysis: 
"Perhaps not since the start of the New Deal [in 1932], to which many of the programs now under 
attack can trace their origins, has Congress moved with such speed on so many fronts."
<p>
The revolutionary character of the change represented by the Contract went beyond the U.S. House 
of Representatives. Not only did the 367 Republican candidates for the House of Representatives 
who signed the document run election campaigns based on its provisions, but many of the 
campaigns for the U.S. Senate, as well as state and local government races, also pivoted around the 
fundamental questions concerning the role of government in society as reflected in the Contract. In 
short, the Contract may come to symbolize the most profound change in the American political 
landscape in the last half century and, in many respects, determine the character of American 
government well into the 21st century.
<p>
<b>The Contract and the Conservatives</b>
<p>
There has been a consistent growth of the role of the central government in the United States, or 
what you might call statism. This expansion of the government was never effectively challenged 
from the development of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal beginning in 1933 until the 1960s. Only 
after the defeat of Richard Nixon in the presidential campaign of 1960 did conservatives in 
America begin to vigorously challenge the growth of the state; at that time, conservatives won 
control of the Republican Party. From this position, the conservatives developed fundamental 
criticisms of statist liberal policies which culminated in the nomination of Barry Goldwater for 
President in 1964. Although Senator Goldwater was badly defeated in that election, both the 
conservative ideals he championed and the cadre of workers he enlisted became the basis of the 
modern conservative political movement in the United States.
<p>
Fortuitously, Senator Goldwater remained active in American politics through his final re-election 
to the United States Senate in 1980, the same year the second great transformation of American 
politics took place with the election of Ronald Reagan as President. It was then that conservatives 
learned two lessons about the role of the Presidency. On the one hand, the President can have a 
profound international impact through his policies, as reflected in the winning of the Cold War and, 
later, the war in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, in the most fundamental area of the size and 
scope of government activities, the President could lead, but a Congress controlled by the 
opposition did not have to follow. Thus, liberal Congressmen often effectively thwarted President 
Reagan's actions. As they often noted, the President is only in office for four or at most eight years, 
whereas Congressmen remained in office often for decades, as did the huge staff support system 
they developed. This "permanent staff" eventually reached over 20,000 personnel on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Thus, the third leg of the conservative revolution in post-World War II America is represented by 
the Contract With America and the election of a clear conservative majority in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. This can become the defining moment in the transformation of the responsibility 
for government in the United States away from the central government and back to state and local 
governments or to the private sector, to families and individuals.
<p>
The changes being debated in America now can provide useful lessons and insights to democratic 
societies throughout the world dealing with social and economic problems similar to those 
confronting the United States.
<p>
In many respects, the changes are already profound. The Contract With America led to much more 
than a change of parties in the United States, leading instead to fundamental philosophical 
questions being raised about government in ways not contemplated for 60 years.
<p>
Perhaps the best way to address various aspects of the Contract With America, the ideas in and 
behind the Contract and its relation to the size and scope of government activities, is to answer 
three basic questions:
<P><ul>
<li>Why was it done?
<li>How was it done?
<li>What has become of the Contract and the ideas it embodied?
</ul>
<p>

<b>Why was it done?</b>
<p>
Despite both the ascendancy of conservatives in the Republican Party and the election of Ronald 
Reagan as President, it became obvious that only a substantial change in the U.S. Congress could 
lead to the revolutionary transformation of America sought by conservatives for decades.
<p>
Many conservatives who came into Congress in the 1980 election and thereafter shared a much 
more dynamic vision of the role of conservatives in the Congress than did their predecessors. And 
among them, Congressman Gingrich consistently articulated his principal goal as the creation of a 
Republican majority in the House and the adoption of a very wide-ranging reform agenda.
<p>
In order to draw the attention of the public to the House of Representatives in the 1994 election, the 
Contract With America was created. The Contract provided the mechanism to move from vague 
political rhetoric to creating a specific political program. Through such a program, one could 
clearly delineate to the general public the contrasting philosophies of government the 1994 election 
offered the electorate.
<p>
The Contract's lineage can be traced back to the 1980 election campaign when most of the 
Republican candidates for federal office similarly stood on the steps of the Capitol in early October 
of that year and promised to support tax cuts, a strong national defense, and reductions in federal 
spending. While the Republicans gained 33 seats in the House that year, the Democrats nonetheless 
maintained their majority, and only the first two of three agenda items were initially adopted; but 
several years later, even the tax cuts and defense spending increases were abandoned. Federal 
spending continued out of control throughout the 1980s.
<p>
The ideas in the Contract emerged from extensive interaction between the new, more aggressive 
conservative Congressmen and the emergence of an extensive network of conservative think tanks, 
such as The Heritage Foundation. In 1980, Heritage and other conservative think tanks initially 
focused attention on changing the government through a change in the executive branch, as 
reflected in our monumental study <i>Mandate for Leadership</i>.
<p>
But after 1980, the attention of conservatives increasingly focused on the Congress. Heritage, for 
example, published a study in cooperation with the Claremont Institute in California on <a 
href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress: Crisis in the Separation of 
Powers</a>, which was published in 1988. Five years later, a successor study from Heritage came 
out entitled <a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">The Ruling Class: Inside the Imperial 
Congress</a>; 2.3 million copies of the later volume reached a wide audience. Both volumes drew 
attention to institutional problems within the Congress that were eventually addressed in the 
Contract With America.
<p>
And finally, Heritage developed a useful handbook, <a 
href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>, that provided specific legislative and 
policy recommendations for conservative candidates for Congress; many of these recommendations 
worked their way into detailed provisions of the Contract With America. In this manner, an 
extensive philosophical groundwork formed the intellectual foundation for the Contract With 
America when it formally appeared in the fall of 1994. Sound ideas thus became anchored into 
concrete policy recommendations.
<p>

<b>How was it done?</b>
<p>
The Contract itself emerged publicly with the staging of the mass signing of the Contract on the 
steps of the U.S. Capitol by 367 candidates for office on September 27, 1994. On that day, all of 
these candidates publicly pledged: "If we break this Contract, throw us out."  The Republicans who 
were already Members of the House of Representatives organized themselves into 11 working 
groups that eventually drafted ten bills that made up the Contract.
<p>
The items in the Contract were carefully selected in terms of issues that were of fundamental policy 
importance but also were "doable," that could be accomplished rather quickly because of the broad 
support they engendered. Extensive public opinion polling revealed that at least 60 percent of 
Americans supported all ten of the specific items in the Contract. By dealing initially with popular 
items, such as the Congress being governed by the same rules as all Americans, and broad 
philosophical concepts, such as balancing the federal budget, the Contract engendered popular 
momentum that could eventually lead to confronting more contentious issues, such as 
environmental regulations and Medicare and Medicaid reforms.
<p>
Politically, the Contract found a particularly receptive audience in the elections in the fall of 1994 
because of a combined disenchantment with the existing Congress and the widespread view of a 
lack of leadership being provided by President Bill Clinton in the White House. The Clinton 
campaign in 1992 had generated the expectation of great changes being made to deal with domestic 
problems. Moreover, the fact that Democrats in 1993 controlled both branches of the Congress 
together with the White House seemed to create the means for changes to take place by breaking 
the so-called partisan gridlock in Washington. But the failure to make substantive policy changes in 
1993 and 1994 clearly facilitated the political changes in November 1994. Thus, the concept of the 
Contract found a particularly receptive audience.
<p>
<b>What has become of the ideas embodied in the Contract?</b>
<P>
One of the revolutionary elements of the Contract is the fact that it actually was implemented as 
promised. Profound disillusionment within the American political system centered on the 
perception that politicians make promises only to be elected and then promptly abandon their 
pledges once safely ensconced in office. Thus, the first and most innovative idea reflected in the 
Contract required politicians to take their own promises seriously and actually implement them.
<p>
The idea of the first 100 days repeated, in a Republican Congress, what had been done by the most 
successful Democratic President in American history; in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt vigorously 
launched the New Deal in his first 100 days in office. The key difference between 1994 and 1932 
was that Republicans only controlled the Congress while a Democrat, President Clinton, still 
remained in the White House. This has clearly limited both the speed and scope of changes.
<p>
The ten items in the Contract were all acted upon in the first 100 days of the new Congress, which 
is what the signatories had pledged. Nine of the ten items in the Contract passed the House: Only 
the constitutional amendment on term limits (which required a two-thirds vote) was defeated. Out 
of a total of 302 roll call votes on issues related to the Contract With America, the conservatives 
prevailed on 299 of them. A balanced budget amendment passed in the House by a 300-123 margin 
but was subsequently defeated as it fell one vote short of the two-thirds needed for passage in the 
U.S. Senate. The overall margin by which the items in the Contract were passed averaged about 70 
percent despite the fact that the Republicans only held a 12-seat margin over the Democrats (52-48 
percent, the smallest House majority margin in 40 years). Given the notorious lack of party 
discipline in the American Congress, the passage by a large majority of nearly all of the items in the 
Contract was a remarkable achievement.
<p>
The ten specific bills which made up the Contract contained numerous provisions addressing a 
wide range of issues. Other elements of the Contract dealt with fundamental institutional political 
reforms. Outlined here are a few of these ideas and their status today.
<p>
<b>Institutional Reform: Making Congress More Democratic</b>
<p>
Most dramatically, the new Congress immediately implemented long-sought reforms within the 
House of Representatives. In this one area where the new Republican majority had full authority, 
they effectively exercised it by dramatically changing the nature of the House of Representatives 
itself during their first day in office; they passed nine major reforms.
<p>
First, they made all the laws that applied to the rest of the country apply to Congress itself; this 
indicated that Congressmen should be treated like other citizens and not remain a privileged elite, 
often immune from the consequences of the very laws they imposed on the rest of the country.
<P>
The House drastically cut by one-third the number of committees and similarly reduced committee 
staff personnel by one-third. In short, the lesson was that cutting back the size of government 
should begin in one's own House and thus establish a useful precedent for the rest of the federal 
government.
<p>
The House also provided for an independent audit of the finances of the House itself. This 
eventually led to a report by Price Waterhouse that found 2,200 instances of double payments for 
travel expenses, 700 retroactive pay hikes despite a rule against this, and, in general, accounting 
practices so out-of-date that the auditors could not be sure of the actual numbers they were working 
with.
<P>
Fundamental institutional change also arose in the Citizen Legislature Act provision of the Contract 
With America, which sought to limit the amount of time a Member of Congress could serve in one 
body to 12 years. This measure thus sought to limit the role of career politicians in Washington. But 
the measure required amending the Constitution and failed to achieve the two-thirds constitutional 
margin necessary. Term limits nonetheless remains a very popular issue, passed by many state 
legislatures; and Republicans promise that it will be the first item voted on if they retain control of 
the House after the 1996 elections.
<p>
<b>Controlling the Growth of Government: The Fiscal Responsibility Act</b>
<p>
A key ingredient, both explicit and implicit, in the Contract is a fundamental change in the 
character of government in the United States. The very first item in the Contract With America 
sought "to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress, requiring them to live under 
the same budget constraints as families and businesses."  The key components of this act were a 
line-item veto and balanced budget/tax limitation amendment. The line-item veto would allow the 
President to strike specific spending provisions in bills without having to veto the entire bill, and 
thus eliminate unnecessary spending. This provision passed both the House and Senate in slightly 
different forms, and President Clinton promises to sign it into law. On the other hand, the balanced 
budget amendment, which required a two-thirds vote to change the Constitution, was defeated. 
Even though not succeeding in passing the amendment itself, the House did pass a balanced budget 
resolution, which in the short term would have the same effect. Thus, the concept of balancing the 
budget has remained a central theme in the U.S. Congress; the means of achieving this could only 
come from a drastic reduction in the size and scope of the federal government.
<p>
The effort to eliminate unnecessary federal government programs has proven to be one of the 
biggest challenges facing the new Congress. Initial enthusiasm about eliminating unjustifiable 
federal programs, such as subsidies to the arts and humanities as well as public television and radio, 
generated fierce and well-organized opposition by the special-interest groups who benefit from the 
programs. Thus, instead of immediately eliminating them, the Congress only voted to phase them 
out over several years. What this means in Washington is that the battle is renewed each year.
<p>
The key lesson for anyone wanting to scale back the size of government is that it is best to 
eliminate a program immediately, as that engenders just as much opposition as reducing funding for 
a program. Only when a program is totally eliminated is the battle over that program won; in 
contrast, incremental reduction simply means revisiting the issue every year.
<p>
The example of the Reagan Presidency is instructive. Only 12 of 94 programs the Reagan 
Administration proposed to eliminate actually ended, and 10 of those were in Mr. Reagan's first 
term. Attempting to simply cut back programs ultimately failed. For example, the Small Business 
Administration (what we now call a welfare program for very few businesses) was cut back from 
$2 billion in 1980 to $85 million in 1989, but by the end of the Bush Administration in 1993, the 
program rose back to $975 million, and it is now once again a target of the new Congress.
<p>
Efforts to eliminate entire Cabinet-level departments of the government also have proved difficult. 
Conservatives have long sought to pursue a policy of "rollback" in dealing with proliferating 
government departments. The prime candidates on the list of government departments 
conservatives seek to eliminate are the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, and Housing 
and Urban Development. But at present, only the Commerce Department seems vulnerable. 
Another congressional initiative that has sought to consolidate the United States Information 
Agency, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Agency for International 
Development into the State Department prospectively would save $3 billion over the next four 
years. The combination of disenchantment with the size of the central government and growing 
budgetary constraints in Congress has created real momentum to seriously reduce the size and 
scope of central government activities in America.
<p>
<b>Welfare Reform: The Personal Responsibility Act</b>
<p>
One of the key ingredients in the initial Contract With America has led to one of the most 
contentious debates in Washington: reforming the welfare state. The Personal Responsibility Act in 
the Contract included prohibiting welfare going to mothers under the age of 18, halting the increase 
of benefits for mothers each time they had additional illegitimate children, and cutting welfare 
spending. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson declared a so-called War on Poverty; but 30 years 
later, after spending an estimated $5.4 trillion on welfare programs, it seems that poverty is winning 
the war. Thirty years of central government welfare programs seem only to have worsened the 
situation. The key problem, as my colleague at The Heritage Foundation, Robert Rector, has 
pointed out, is that "the welfare programs present a 'moral hazard' -- a strong tendency to increase 
the behaviors which are rewarded by welfare benefits."  Specifically, "when welfare benefits are 
tied, directly or indirectly, to such behaviors as low work effort, divorce, and illegitimacy, welfare 
strongly promotes an increase in those behaviors."  This only creates an ever-escalating cycle of 
more spending.
<p>
The Personal Responsibility Act of the Contract sought to fundamentally revamp the role of the 
state in welfare policy by developing policies to reduce teenage pregnancies and illegitimate births 
by prohibiting aid to mothers under 18 who give birth out of wedlock and requiring them to name 
the fathers of their children, who would be held accountable for their actions. Such women would 
be required to live at home to receive any aid and would not get housing subsidies to set up their 
own apartments. The Act also required that aid be cut off if recipients did not work.
<p>
The federal government provides 72 percent ($234.3 billion) of all welfare benefits, compared to 28 
percent ($90 billion) by the states. This has led the Congress to set certain general standards and 
criteria that recipients of aid must meet to receive benefits. But beyond some general restrictions, 
the key reform of welfare consists of attempting to decentralize the program to the 50 states and 
thereby stimulate numerous creative approaches to dealing with social problems.
<p>
This reflected the general conservative philosophical view in the Contract. As Speaker Gingrich 
writes in his book <i>To Renew America</i>: "We must replace our centralized, micro-managed, 
Washington-based bureaucracy with a dramatically decentralized system more appropriate to a 
continent-wide country... 'Closer is better' would be the rule of thumb for our decision making; less 
power in Washington and more back home, our consistent theme."
<p>
<b>Unleashing the American Economy: The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</b>
<p>
This Act attempted to reverse the increasingly debilitating role of the federal government in the 
American economy. One of its major provisions that has passed both the House and Senate ended 
so-called unfunded mandates which require states and local communities to impose various 
regulations but do not provide them the money to carry them out. In this manner, Congress passed 
allegedly beneficial laws that were cost-free, at least to the federal government. But such laws had 
enormous destructive power on states, local communities, and businesses. It was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office that such regulations cost state and local government from $8.9 
billion to $12.7 billion between 1983 and 1990 and that the costs were growing. Similarly, the 
federal government often imposed costly regulations on businesses that stifled economic expansion 
by companies.
<p>
The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act included a variety of tax law changes and reforms in 
federal bureaucratic procedures that would enhance private property rights and economic liberty. 
Specifically, it provided for a 50 percent capital gains rate cut, allowed small businesses to deduct 
the first $25,000 worth of investment each year, reduced paperwork burdens on business by at least 
five percent, and required federal agencies to assess the risks and cost of each new regulation being 
imposed. Finally, the Contract provided for a Citizens Bill of Rights for anyone subject to 
investigation or inspection by a federal agency.
<p>
<b>Non-statist Approaches to Social Problems: The Family Reinforcement Act</b>
<p>

This Act similarly sought to refocus attention on the family and away from the government as the 
source of solutions to social problems. Thus, the Act reinforced child support orders issued by 
courts requiring absent fathers to financially support their children and provided both a refundable 
tax credit of up to $5,000 for families adopting a child and another tax credit of $500 for families 
caring for a dependent elderly parent or grandparent. Rather than emphasize institutionally provided 
state care, this Act sought to get orphaned children into homes and encourage family care of 
relatives. Similarly, another element of the tax provisions of the Contract provided a $500-per-child 
tax credit, which would mean that a family of four earning $28,000 would have their tax burden cut 
by one-third.
<p>
Other provisions provided incentives for saving money to be used for college education or buying a 
home and for ending a tax benefit for couples who live together but do not get married. For 
example, a couple earning $40,000 each will pay only $6,633 each in taxes if filing returns 
separately; but on a joint return, their combined taxes will rise by $1,285 to $14,541, or about a 10 
percent tax penalty for being legally married.
<p>
These proposals, as well as others, rested upon a fundamental philosophical principle, as stated in 
the book version of the Contract With America: "The American family is at the very heart of our 
society.... After forty years of putting others first [we] will put families first.... It is through the 
family that we learn values like responsibility, morality, commitment and faith." 
<p>
<b>Other Items in the Contract</b>
<p>
The remaining items in the Contract deal less with the role and nature of the state than with 
confronting specific legal and security issues. This includes dealing with the growing threat of 
crime in America, reforming the legal system, and improving the security of the country. They 
reflect the broad scope of the Contract but go beyond the scope of this lecture.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The ideas espoused in the Contract With America represented the culmination of 30 years of 
creative conservative thinking dealing with the basic social and economic problems of modern 
America. The ideas provided the background for the widest range of legislative initiatives, certainly 
since the 1930s, and possibly at any time in American political history. The fundamental principle 
involves re-examining the role of the government in society.
<p>
Central government attempts to solve many problems have only made them worse; thus, the 
Contract With America represents specific practical steps that can be taken in a wide range of 
government activities to roll them back. Ultimately, the government should cease many of its 
activities; but what is necessary now is a realistic transitional mechanism to achieve that goal. The 
Contract With America provides precisely the kind of formula that can accomplish that objective.

<title>Lessons on Reforming Health Care at the State Level -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 548</b><br>
<h3>Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and 
Educational Programs</a></h3>

<h2>Lessons on Reforming Health Care At the State Level: 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, And Washington State</h2> 
A Physicians Council Symposium<br>
June 13, 1995<br>


<a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">DR. ROBERT E. MOFFIT</a>, Deputy Director of 
Domestic Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation: With last year's collapse of President Clinton's 
huge health plan, we have seen throughout the country a growth in policy experimentation at the 
state level. But the striking feature about most of these state-based reforms is that, in many 
instances -- such as Washington, Tennessee, Minnesota, and Kentucky -- the health care reform 
proposals resemble, in crucial respects, the discredited Clinton health care plan.
Like the Clinton plan, these systems concentrate key decisionmaking power in the hands of 
government officials. The health care system is to be governed by a central board or commission 
that issues rules and regulations and guidelines for the system. Almost all of them have a 
comprehensive, government-standardized benefits package specifying in some detail the treatments 
or procedures that must be available to citizens. Most establish government-sponsored health care 
cooperatives, or regional alliances at the state levels, or managed care networks. Most include 
employer mandates and a system of price controls.
<p>
But state reformers have painfully discovered that, in many respects, reform at the state level is 
subject to the same explosive politics as reform at the national level. The politics of health care 
reform is like the politics of a Rubik's cube. It is an excruciating exercise in frustration: You fix one 
thing only to find that you are breaking another.
<p>
Talking about reform of health care at the state level, we have three distinguished panelists.
<p>
<a href="#mass">Charles Baker</a> comes to us from the state of Massachusetts. He was 
appointed Secretary of Administration and Finance by Governor William Weld in November of 
1994. Mr. Baker directs the preparation of the Governor's budget proposals in Massachusetts and 
serves as the Governor's chief advisor on fiscal matters. Prior to assuming that role, he was 
Undersecretary of Health in the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. As 
Undersecretary, he managed six health agencies and was responsible for the reform of the hospital 
finance system.
<p>
The second of our panelists is <a href="#minn">Dr. Ken Heithoff</a>. Dr. Heithoff is Chairman 
of the CDI Management Corporation and Medical Director of the Center for Diagnostic Imaging in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, a physician-owned company. He is a member of the Hammond County 
Medical Society, the Minnesota Medical Association, and the American College of Radiology. 
Very active in market-based health care reform in Minnesota, he served as an advisor to 
Congressman Jim Ramstad and Senator Rod Grams, the new Senator for Minnesota. Dr. Heithoff is 
the Chairman of the Minnesota Independent Republican Health Care Task Force, which has been 
meeting regularly since April of 1994.
<p>
<a href="#wash">Phil Dyer</a> is the state representative of the fifth district in Washington 
State. Representative Dyer serves on the Health Care Committee of the Washington State House. 
He has a B.S. from Oregon State University. He also is a graduate of the Army Corps of Engineers, 
serving as a member of the Command General Staff College. Representative Dyer received a public 
service award from the National Federation of Independent Business. He was the leading opponent 
of Washington State's Clinton-style health care plan.
<p>
<a name="mass"></a>
<b>MASSACHUSETTS</b>
<p>
CHARLES BAKER: The most important thing about state-level health care reform is to remember 
the old Clint Eastwood saying about knowing your limitations. I agree with The Heritage 
Foundation and with Dr. Kevin Vigilante and others that the major genetic error in the current 
structure of the existing health care system is the federal tax code. And because that's the major, 
fundamental structural problem, it has created a corporate relationship between health plans and 
provider systems as opposed to an individual relationship between patients and doctors.
<p>
Therefore, I was never that interested, at the state level, in pursuing anything as broad and as 
comprehensive as Minnesota Care, or Tenn Care, or Washington State Care, or whatever else you 
call them. But we did have some things to deal with when Governor Weld took office in 1991. Our 
Medicaid program had been growing 22 percent a year for the previous three or four years and was 
basically "PacMan-ing" its way through the rest of the state budget. At the same time, you had an 
angry beneficiary community, an angry provider community, an angry physician community -- 
everybody was angry, but the thing was hemorrhaging money at the same time.
<p>
We also had probably the most regulated hospital finance system in the United States, second only 
to perhaps Maryland or New York. Hospital prices were still growing 10 and 11 percent a year. 
Health care costs generally were growing about 16 percent a year. 
<p>
The standard response from a lot of the folks in the political establishment was, "Well, obviously 
the regulatory model isn't being implemented hard enough."  This was directly opposed to my point 
of view, which was that the state's regulatory model was creating the perverse incentives that were 
driving the rate of spending and making everybody so cranky about what they were getting on the 
service delivery end at the same time.
<p>
<b>Deregulation.</b> So we pursued a fairly aggressive strategy on two fronts. The first was to 
disencumber the provider system from the existing regulatory mass. We managed to pass 
legislation that was signed by the Governor in the fall of 1991 that basically deregulated, on 
January 1, 1992, the entire hospital financing system. Among the naysayers, the sense at the time 
was that this was going to ruin the tight rules that had done such a good job of controlling spending 
in Massachusetts. 
<p>
The good news is that health care spending in Massachusetts in fiscal 1994, the last year for which 
we have final year data, was actually up a little less than two or three percent, and hospital spending 
was actually down a little bit. And the hospital industry overall was in pretty good financial shape. 
This was the exact opposite of what the liberals had said was going to occur. Instead, we took the 
lid off on the pricing, and a very funny thing happened: The market worked. This, of course, didn't 
come as a big surprise to me, but I think it came as a big surprise to lots of other people.
<p>
<b>Medicaid.</b> The second was to improve Medicaid. We started with two assumptions. First, 
that markets were good. Second, that doctors were good. A big part of the political problem that we 
had in Massachusetts was that nobody trusted anybody. In 1988, the head of the Massachusetts 
Medical Society went to the national annual meeting of the AMA and referred to Massachusetts as 
the Beirut of medicine. Early on, I made it a point to make sure that we had doctors involved in 
practically all of our major health care initiatives -- and I mean practicing doctors, not unpracticing 
doctors -- because I believed that they would have a lot of very positive and useful and helpful 
insights into how you could go about doing something to fix a very broken Medicaid program.
<p>
We ended up implementing what I think remains today the largest and perhaps the only statewide 
managed care initiative for Medicaid recipients in the United States. It's got almost 650,000 folks 
enrolled, and it's really two programs. We have a traditional HMO program, but that only serves 
about 100,000 folks. That is the straight plan -- a capitated payment arrangement. But the vast 
majority of the recipients that we serve are served through a primary care program managed by 
about 3,000 doctors. 
<p>
One of the things we decided not to do was to compel physicians to participate in this program. 
Rather, we proposed to raise their fee structure, believing that if we raised their fee structure, they 
would be more likely to serve Medicaid recipients. We thought one of the problems we had with 
the old system was that its fee structure was so bad, and its rules were so bad, that a lot of folks who 
otherwise would have been served by doctors were going to hospitals. This was the most expensive 
and, in many cases, the most inappropriate place for them to get served.
<p>
The other thing we learned was that, despite the statewide availability of plenty of good physicians, 
we had unbelievably high utilization of the Boston teaching hospitals as a source for primary care -- 
totally disproportionate to the population it represented -- for our Medicaid population. So we got 
very aggressive about working with the medical societies and some of the other major physician 
groups to try to create a new relationship between the physician community and the Medicaid 
program. 
<p>
One objective was to get care out of Boston and to hospitals in other parts of the state, and to try to 
develop real relationships out in the hinterlands to serve this population. As a result, there has been 
a dramatic decline in the use of teaching hospitals as sources of primary care for Medicaid 
beneficiaries. As you might suspect, this has been good for patient care, good for local physician-
patient relationships, and good for us. We saved a lot of money by giving people a local and more 
appropriate source for primary and preventive and specialty health care.
<p>
The other interesting thing that we did -- based on advice we got from people on the plan side and 
from the physician community -- was hire an independent company to help us help Medicaid 
beneficiaries make decisions about who they wanted to have do their primary care for them, and to 
help solve what I would refer to as the doctor/program conflict.
<p>
There was never anybody they could call, except some 1-800 number in Boston, to get an answer 
about some problem they were having with the Medicaid program. So one of the things we did was 
contract with a private entity to set up a field-based intermediary that could help solve, at the local 
level, physician problems and recipient problems with the Medicaid program. As a result, I think 
we were able to level the playing field and take some of the marketing and enrollment techniques 
that have dominated a lot of the public payer programs on the plan side out of the loop, and we 
created a truly level playing field. We also gave physicians a place to go to get their questions 
answered.
<P>
We now have over 3,000 doctors enrolled in the primary care program. For the most part, we 
survey them, and we have a standing advisory committee that works on particular issues. It has 
been very successful. For example, we discovered we had a big problem with hospitalization for 
pediatric asthma -- just off-the-chart numbers. It didn't make any sense. The standard way to deal 
with that would be to assume that it's bad medicine and that somehow it's the doctors' fault.
<p>
What we did instead was ask our advisory group to start talking to some of the doctors who dealt 
with significant numbers of Medicaid patients to find out why this was happening. We learned 
three things. Most physicians didn't know that nebulizers were covered under the Medicaid 
program. The two primary drugs that you would prescribe to serve kids who had asthma problems 
were on a prior approval list that was a colossal pain in the neck for a physician to get approved, 
and, as a result, they weren't prescribing them. And we found we had done a lousy job of helping 
the physician community understand what kinds of services and medications were covered under 
the Medicaid program.
<p>
So, again, working with some of the professional societies, we went through a major education 
campaign. We took all of the asthma drugs off the prior approval list, made sure people knew that 
nebulizers were indeed part of the program, and used the medical society as our primary outlet for 
information. Information from those of us in the government always ends up reading like 
bureaucratic prose, whereas if it comes from medical groups, it can be translated into a language 
that doctors participating in the program understand.
<p>
The end result has been a gradual decline in pediatric asthma admissions, which -- as the father of a 
four-year-old who has asthma and spends a lot of time with that kid on the nebulizer -- is a big win. 
It's a big win for physicians who want to do the right thing on behalf of their patients, it's a big win 
for the state in terms of cost-effective service delivery, and it's a big win for families who don't like 
to have to sleep on the chair next to the hospital bed for two or three nights while their kid's sitting 
there breathing so hard that every fiber of his being is concentrating on just making sure he gets his 
next puff of air.
<p>
<b>Treating AIDS.</b> The other thing we've done that has been kind of interesting in this area 
is take some of our most difficult populations -- end stage AIDS sufferers, for example -- and ask 
physician groups if they would be willing to capitate to serve these populations. The argument is 
simple: Medicaid is a very narrowly defined program under federal rules, and there are many things 
you can do for AIDS patients that make a very big difference in terms of dignity, quality of life, and 
cost effectiveness that aren't covered under the existing fee-for-service program.
<p>
So, we said to some of the group practices that dealt with a lot of HIV patients, "Look, we'll 
capitate you, and we'll establish some risk relationships so you're not wildly exposed out there, and 
we'll try to sell it to the federal government. The idea here will be that you'll be able to spend your 
capitation on whatever you think the patient needs, which in many cases is not traditional but is 
appropriate for somebody in those circumstances, both from a cost-effectiveness point of view and 
a quality of life point of view. We think this will be good for you. It will get us out of your hair on 
prior approval, we will refrain from looking over your shoulder, and you'll have a lot more 
flexibility about how you treat them. It will be good for us because it will give you an opportunity 
to expand your horizon in terms of how you take care of them, and if we can do it at a rate that 
looks as good, or better, than our fee-for-service average participant, then we win, too."
<p>
But, of course, we had to run it by Washington. It took us a year and a half to get the federal 
government to agree to let us do this, despite the fact that they were going to save money on their 
Medicaid program, because they paid for 50 percent of it. But the results have been astounding. 
Hospitalization, for example, for these folks has been driven practically to zero, and doctors have 
been using all kinds of interventions and service delivery techniques that are very nontraditional to 
improve the way they take care of these patients. It also has moved the knowledge base a light year 
as a result. 
<P>
What was required to make this work was a lot more flexibility on our part about how the physician 
treated the patient. People say, "Well, you can't make capitation work because the population is too 
sick," but people say this about the Medicare population, the over-65s. The best capitated program 
we've put in place is taking care of the end stage AIDs patient. You can't get much sicker than that 
population, and it has turned out to be, in many ways, a big improvement over what we did 
previously.
<p>
And, you know, our Medicaid growth rate this year is less than 2 percent. Our case load adjusted 
growth rate has seen negative numbers for three years now. We have a provider community that's a 
lot happier with what we are doing now than they were with the system before. The client 
community also is a lot happier. But most of it is really a function of giving people, at the level 
where the decisions needed to be made, more authority to make decisions and turning some of the 
incentives around. I believe you can do the same thing with Medicare. 
<p>
<b>Implications for Medicare.</b> When people say the way to fix Medicare is to cut the fees, 
they are missing the point. The way to fix Medicare is to create a system with the right set of 
incentives for both the provider and the patient to do the right thing. More often than not, doing the 
right thing is the cheapest and most cost-effective way to solve a problem. It also assures the 
highest quality.
<p>
I really hope this Medicare debate does not become fear mongering and scare tactics, because there 
is a much larger issue at stake here. The physician-patient relationship is part of it, but more 
importantly, at least from my point of view as a dad, we have to balance the federal budget for our 
children and we have to do it soon. Otherwise we are just ruining the lives of our children and our 
grandchildren and setting up an impossible dynamic for them. It will be impossible for them to 
grow and be successful in this country while carrying this huge debt and its growing interest 
payments.
<p>
<b>Federal Deficits.</b> The final point I'd like to make is also the most important: Medicare has 
to be part of the discussion about the federal budget deficit, as does Medicaid. You simply can't 
balance the federal budget unless you take an honest look at these two programs. As a real deficit 
hawk, whose four-year-old and one-year-old sons are already inheriting four-and-a-half trillion 
dollars worth of federal debt, I'm ashamed that we have let this happen. I've been saying this to all 
the folks that come see me as the chief financial person in the state and whine about this cut and 
that cut. I don't care whose ox gets gored here. I want to see a federal budget that is balanced at 
some point in the next ten years, because I'm jeopardizing the lives and well-being of my children 
by not being willing to bite the bullet on this one.
<P>
The important role that you and Heritage and others can play in this discussion is to drive home the 
core message that balancing the federal budget is something this country has to do. And you can't 
do it by raising taxes. Why?  Because it's a spending problem. It's not a revenue problem.

<b>MINNESOTA</b>
<p>
<b>DR. KEN HEITHOFF</b>: I happen to agree with Bob Moffit's statement that you can't really 
achieve much fundamental reform at the state level, and that's the quandary. Representative Dyer 
has been there, and he's back from the trip. And in Minnesota, we're pretty much back.
We had a Clinton-style plan, just as Washington State did. Let me describe for you the chronology 
of Minnesota Care and how it evolved. When Surgeon General Everett Koop was there in 1992, he 
looked at Minnesota's health care system, which had been rated as one or two in the country in 
terms of quality. He said, "This system doesn't seem to be broken. Why fix it?" 
<p>
It was a political and economic phenomenon. We had a recession. There were a lot of white collar 
workers out of jobs, and the first thing that they were going to lose, because we had an employer-
based system, was their health care benefits. Liberal politicians came back from their little political 
sojourn into the rural countryside in Minnesota and decided that they needed to fix the state's health 
care system.
<p>
They had some very capable help. Although Representative Dyer in Washington and I have been 
there and are on our way back, some of you are going to begin this journey. The template for the 
Clinton-style state-based reform is going to be the same. Whether it's Minnesota or Washington or 
Tennessee or Kentucky, they will all look the same. They all have the same structure, and they all 
follow the same political agenda.
<P>
Nevertheless, after two years of this in Minnesota, I don't think there are any bad people. As 
physicians we need to stop feeling sorry for ourselves; nobody else is going to. Regardless of the 
reality, we are seen as a privileged, wealthy class. That's not the reality for a lot of our primary care 
practitioners, but nobody is going to listen to you.
<p>
I used to sit and carp about this in the doctors' lounge. I used to be very angry about it. I'm not 
angry any more. The reason: A lot of our state-based reformers simply have a different philosophy. 
It's not about health care. There isn't a damned thing that you can do, sitting in your office, to 
practice better medicine that will change how this thing turns out.
<p>
First of all, physicians have to understand that it's about economics, and it's about power. We have 
been villainized by the media and by the politicians during the past two or three or four years for a 
very specific purpose. It is not because they think we're bad people, but they have to break the bond 
of trust between physicians and their patients in order to have the kind of government disruption of 
the medical delivery service that they have been attempting. So forget all of the things that you hear 
and read in the papers. Maybe stop reading the papers for a while. Have faith in free-market 
principles, because they're extremely powerful and they do work.
<p>
I am convinced that we are at the low point. Five years from now, we will have a hard time 
recognizing the kind of fear and trepidation that we have experienced in recent years. The classic 
managed care and HMO philosophies will become pass‚ because personally managed care -- I 
think Speaker Newt Gingrich coined that term -- is a much more powerful concept than managed 
care. "Managed care" is a misnomer. It should be called "restrictive care."
<p>
In Minnesota, we started, I think, between 1985 and 1987. Some of our legislators teamed up with 
the Children's Defense Fund. The debate always starts with access, because you can't really get 
people too excited about cost, at least at first. But the debate quickly shifts to costs. Quite frankly, 
this is the fruit of a dysfunctional third-party employer-based system of finance which has become 
unaffordable for employers.
<p>
<b>The Role of Business.</b> I don't happen to share the view that the employers are necessarily 
physicians' enemies. They now understand that they are going to be taken care of by the same 
system. CEOs in our state have come face to face with the Minnesota health care delivery system. 
The legislation collapsed the insurance market into three oligopolies, where 80 percent of our 
insurance products are delivered by three highly integrated, vertically integrated systems. The 
Business Health Care Action Group was instrumental in proposing that health care be delivered in 
that way. But after playing with the "reformers" for two years, they got very frightened by what 
happened. Why?  Because under Minnesota Care, fee for service would be destroyed, but it would 
be replaced by a tightly managed care delivery system. Care would be delivered through integrated 
service networks, and those integrated service networks, by definition, included physicians, 
hospitals, and an insurance company.
<p>
There were only a few people that could play in such a marketplace, and it was, in fact, promoted 
by this Business Health Care Action Group. They put out a request for proposal which could only 
be answered by such a very, very strongly integrated service network. But after two years of 
working with that, and seeing the competitive market collapse, they became very frightened. About 
a month to six weeks ago, they did a 180 degree about-face. They have announced their intention to 
contract directly with competing physician groups rather than obtain coverage through health plans. 
They are all self-insured employers. This is a watershed event, not just for Minnesota, but for the 
nation as a whole. 
<p>
The business leaders have gone to the health plans, the health plan not being an arrangement 
between the physician and the patients, and have said, "You know, we're really sick and tired of 
paying you guys millions of dollars and having all the recipients [the doctors] be upset about it."  
Who is upset?  The providers, the patients, and even the employers. The people who are buying the 
plans are not the people who are receiving the care. 
<p>
So now they are saying, "We want to contract directly with the physician organizations for our 
health care. We want to put the health plan outside of the physician-patient relationship, not 
between it."  The health plans have become huge oligopolies; we have a $2.2 billion organization 
which used to be our physicians' health plan -- it became United Health Care when the state 
government declared that physicians couldn't own it. United Health Care now has $2.6 billion of 
cash. Our Physicians Health Plan, which became Medica, merged with 27 hospitals into a $2.2 
billion structure called Allina, and now they're buying out the physicians that started Physicians 
Health Plan.
<P>
We have about five physician-directed organizations in Minnesota, independent physicians who 
have gathered together as an alternative, to practice and to try to stay independent rather than be 
enrolled in integrated service networks. 
<p>
<b>The Political Process.</b> Although they wanted to go to a single-payer system like the 
Canadian system -- the people who began this process were all still single-payer advocates -- there 
were a few people who understood that the single-payer option wasn't politically palatable. They 
tried it in 1991. It was vetoed by the Republican Governor, Arne Carleson.
<P>
Because the Republicans were convinced that the Governor's veto would be overridden and we 
would have a single-payer system in 1991, the Republicans in the legislature had to sit down with 
the Democrats and the Governor. We thus had a situation where both political parties and the 
Governor favored Minnesota Care, even though the people who started that process and who ran 
Minnesota Care from the beginning were dyed-in-the-wool, absolute advocates of the single-payer 
system. They pushed Minnesota Care in that direction, using emotional appeals and saying 
anything but what they were really after. Both political parties in the state went along.
<p>
Minnesota Care became a very tightly regulated, centrally controlled, Clinton-type plan instead of 
the free-market approach it was supposed to be, and which the Governor continued to say it was. It 
wasn't until 1994, when the Governor and the people in the Republican caucuses began to be very 
skeptical of where this was going, that the Governor reversed course and wrote an open letter to 
Minnesotans expressing concern over the direction of Minnesota Care. 
<p>
Minnesota Care was an incremental bill. It started in 1992, but it wasn't to be fully implemented 
until 1997. It set up a series of stepping stones along the way. The Governor signed the bill, but in 
the open letter to the people of Minnesota in 1994, he raised some very significant questions. At the 
same time, I had been working with Representative Jim Ramstad, and I had also obtained 
considerable material from The Heritage Foundation, which was really pushing for free-market 
health reform. Senior Republicans came to me and said, "Put your money where your mouth is. If 
you really want to pursue a free-market approach, if you want to have something, let's start a health 
care task force. But it has to be self-funding."
<p>
We started with an initial funding of about $18,000 and took a multidisciplinary approach to health 
care reform. The idea was to educate the legislators because it was appalling to me that after two 
years of this national and state debate, when you would think that all the legislators would be 
unequivocally informed about health care, the fact was that most of them were not. Everybody told 
them that health care was too difficult to understand. For most people, that was a convenient excuse 
for not putting forth the effort to become informed, and they really didn't understand it.
<p>
We held field hearings. We went to regional briefings for all the candidates before the election. We 
sat down with all the incumbents. We sat down with all of the new prospective candidates. We used 
Heritage Foundation materials extensively, explaining the relationship between the health insurance 
markets, tax policies, and the health care "crisis."
<P>
Initially, we couldn't talk about Minnesota Care because it was supported by the Republican Party 
leadership. We started with an anti-single-payer slant, or an anti-Clinton slant. But it was quite 
interesting that, when we talked specifically about what was bad about the Clinton health care plan, 
they had been around Minnesota Care long enough to know they were similar in many respects.
<p>
We formed a legislative subcommittee which drafted an alternative bill. I would invite you to look 
into this educational process, because it's wonderful to be inside the process and not a special-
interest lobbyist on the outside, not a physician who's complaining about something or looking for 
something. If you are promoting solid information -- which is a good policy for all, not just 
providers -- they come to trust you. The information that you're giving is something that is good for 
them and that is good for their constituents.
<p>
As a result, we drafted a bill, an alternative to Minnesota Care, which was the first time that this 
had even been contemplated. The Governor did not openly support the process. But then came the 
1994 election. We had two of the old guard of the Minnesota Republican Party who decided they 
would not run for re-election, and it gave us a chance for new blood and new leadership. The end 
result was that we proposed the bill and crafted a bill with providers, with the physicians and 
patients, with insurance people, with nurses, chiropractors, and dentists. Everybody got involved.
<p>
At the same time, we got involved in politics. We had 3,000 members. We had 800 major 
contributors, and we raised $86,000. We participated in probably six major campaigns. We worked 
closely with Rod Grams in his successful Senate bid. I personally wrote a letter to 14,000 health 
care providers in Minnesota about two weeks before the election, and a lot of those people 
contributed individually.
<p>
In the meantime, our task force crafted a reform bill. Because it had business input, and because it 
had insurance industry input, as well as provider and consumer input, it was well crafted and 
economically sound. Even though we were still in the minority in Minnesota, we came within two 
votes of passage. We weren't as successful as our colleagues in Washington State, but we came 
within two votes of having our bill supersede Minnesota Care. In the process, because our 
legislators not only were convinced of the correctness of the free-market approach, but also really 
understood it, they talked across the aisles with their Democrat colleagues, and we, in fact, had 
pretty close to a working bipartisan majority. 
<p>
We got the head of the Senate Finance Committee -- a Democrat and probably the most respected 
legislator on both sides of the aisle -- to cosponsor our health reform bill. And because our 
legislators understood the issues, and they were passionate about free-market health care reform, we 
amended the Minnesota Care bill that came out of committee. We slowed and, in some cases, 
repealed some of the more onerous parts of Minnesota Care.
<p>
In the 1994 election, 13 seats were added to the conservative Republican side. Conservatives won 
all five special elections. The Governor is going to be appointing a couple of Democrats to 
positions in the state bureaucracy. We're going to win those special elections, so I think we're going 
to have a clear majority or a working conservative majority in our House, and we're very close in 
the Senate.
<p>
It is remarkable what we have accomplished and how much fun it has been, for somebody who was 
totally out of politics or the policy process before this, to be part of this effort. I had never chaired 
anything like this before. I tried to shy away from it, but I saw my ideas begin to have effect, and 
we continued to show gains and gather momentum. It also would not have been possible if we had 
not been supplied an executive director. The chairman of the Republican Party gave us a 
remarkable young woman who had worked in Congressman Bob Michel's office. She knew the 
political arena. She knew who was important at meetings and how to approach them -- what we 
could and could not say. I got the credit for being the chair, but she was responsible for the success 
that we had in terms of setting up the meetings, the agenda, and providing continuity and vital 
advice and contacts. 
<p>
In terms of education, <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> and <a 
href="/heritage/staff/moffit">Bob Moffit</a> of The Heritage Foundation came out and did a 
remarkable job for us, along with Molly Bordonaro from the American Legislative Exchange 
Council. The education of legislators was (and continues to be) the most important function we 
perform. We are back, and what we did not get this year, we will get next year. We repealed price 
controls on providers. We put off the mandated universal coverage that was supposed to go into 
effect in 1997. We put that off indefinitely. We also changed the universal defined benefit plan and 
repealed the regulated all-payer system. This was supposed to be left for us independent 
practitioners. It was a highly regulated, impossible situation. Only now are people beginning to 
admit that it was never intended to be implemented but proposed to frightened independent 
physicians to persuade them to voluntarily become employees of the large integrated service 
networks.
<p>
We have come back -- not as far as Washington State, but we are on our way. What are the lessons? 
 First, you should trust free-market principles. They will work. What has been unleashed in this 
debate are the free-market ideas: medical savings accounts, personally managed care, voucher 
systems, and so forth. That is so compelling to me. I have no fear that we independent practitioners 
will continue to exist and that private medical practice will see a real comeback. But we have to do 
nationally what we've done in Minnesota: form larger organizations of independent physicians.
<p>
We have 1,300 physicians in five physician-directed organizations. I sat on two of their boards, and 
it was heart-breaking for me to see these proud professionals go hat in hand to the three large health 
plans, essentially begging for some insurance product that the PDOs -- physician directed 
organizations -- could offer through the health plan. I knew it wasn't going to happen because it was 
not in the interest of the health plans to do so. They don't want us to succeed; they want physicians 
subjugated to their bureaucracies.
<p>
We have been meeting to try to put together a physician-directed organization where all five would 
come together and offer an insurance product. One of the ideas was that physicians and their 
families and their employees -- all 12,000 of us -- would offer a medical savings account (MSA) 
and demonstrate to the employers in our market that we could, in fact, drive down the cost of 
medicine by 30 or 40 percent with an open access, consumer-friendly plan -- to use our own 
practices as a beta test site.
<P>
We are looking at other options. I don't think we can out-HMO the big corporate players, but if we 
come to the market with some very creative alternatives, such as MSAs and managed care in its 
best sense -- best practices, best practitioners, and so forth -- we can succeed.
<p>
Given my recent experience, and the successful momentum generated by a relatively small group of 
dedicated individuals, I have little sympathy for people in the medical profession who say that they 
do not have the time and money to become involved in the political process. I've seen the 
chiropractors do a lot more with a lot less money and a lot more contributions. They were very 
helpful in getting bipartisan support. They also bought into the idea of medical savings accounts 
and wrote a letter of support.
<p>
We have to educate ourselves. Most physicians haven't heard about The Heritage Foundation. I 
think that's a problem. They don't understand that health care reform is not about how they practice 
medicine, but about the perverse incentives of the current financing system; that turning our 
delivery system upside down can cure the ills if the financial incentives aren't damaged. Thankfully, 
that is occurring.
<p>
The underlying principle and meaning of professionalism is a primary focus on our vocation and 
disinterest in economic gain. I firmly believe that 98 percent of the professionals that I practice 
with, and all of you in this room, are interested in taking care of your patients and would just like to 
get back to doing that. But you can't ignore the economics. Instead of playing golf, we have to do 
this. If it's another hour, then do it. You all worked 24 hours a day when you were interns. I think 
you have to go back to that for a short period of time. I don't want to do this for a long time, but I 
think that for the next year or two it is essential.

<b>WASHINGTON STATE</b>
<p>
<b>REPRESENTATIVE PHIL DYER:</b> Dr. Heithoff talked about sacrifice. I don't mean to 
sound "Woe is me," but I'd like to take you back in history just a little bit. In 1990, in the state of 
Washington, Governor Gardner, the predecessor to our current Governor Lowry, in his second term 
convened a broad, bipartisan, cross-cultural, horizontal agglomeration of business, labor, all the 
players, and called it his Health Care Commission. There were 13 voting members, plus a large 
number of advisory committees.
<p>
I, for 24 years now, have worked in the medical malpractice insurance field, so I come with a little 
bias in understanding the delivery system and the finance system. I worked for the task force 
regarding tort reform, which had been a crusade for me for many, many years.
<p>
I watched as the 13 Commission members, through 1990, leading up to 1992's election, sat and 
narrowly voted for provision after provision. You are going to hear some similarities between what 
Ken talked about in Minnesota and what Washington State adopted, as if the two states were 
literally lying on top of each other.
<p>
For instance, in 1992, the Commission voted, by one vote, to go with the single-payer system. It 
was an insidious setup for what they called managed competition, the system that was introduced 
following the 1992 elections in Washington State. The political complexion of the Washington 
state legislature at that time then became very heavily Democratic, which it had narrowly been for a 
long time.
<p>
I was not an elected official. We had an open district where there was an open seat, a Republican 
district. And I, a white male Republican, found myself facing a female Democratic opponent. I 
won, with 50.4 percent of the vote, less than 51 percent. 
<p>
I went to the legislature as a freshman. I walked into a caucus in the House of Representatives of 98 
members, and the ranking minority leader turned to me and said, "We need a chairman for the 
Health Care Committee. We've got a minor little debate going on on major policy here. Phil, you're 
it. You're all we've got."
<P>
Four days into the legislature, I became the ranking minority member on the Health Care 
Committee, where I watched the passage of a bill that was constantly being revised, with 202 FAX-
headers -- the latest wisdom from Washington, D.C. -- coming into the Democratic caucus, because 
in that spring of 1993, the Ira Magaziner task force had been formed and was, in fact, operating.
<p>
We ended up with a "managed care only" law that had premium caps, a broad-powered health 
services commission independent of public accountability, a uniform benefit plan dictated by that 
commission, and employer mandates. The only difference between the Clinton plan and ours was 
that Clinton was an 80 percent mandate and we were 50 percent sponsorship. We also had alliances 
that were unique geographic monopolies, and government-certified health plans -- a mimic of what 
we saw introduced later here in the lesser Washington, as we prefer to call it.
<p>
In 1993, the liberal mantra was not dissimilar to our friends at Nike: "Just do it."  And in "just 
doing it," you'll see another similarity. It was later admitted, in reviews with the legislators that 
passed the law in 1993, that fewer than ten out of 147 legislators had even read the bill. They were 
caught up in the emotion of the reform rhetoric and compassion for the downtrodden. No 
understanding of either the current system or the damage they were going to do to that system was 
evident. 
<p>
Nor did they understand the dissimilarities between health care financing and health care delivery. 
They would mix their rhetoric in talking about universality and access as if no one was getting any 
health care at all. This was in direct contradiction to the 1986 COBRA, which had said to all 
facilities, "You're going to take somebody in whether they've got a dime to their name or not."  No 
discussion of uncompensated care was contemplated.
<p>
The similarities are dramatic. Dr. Heithoff and I had talked briefly, but in listening to his 
presentation, I could have listened for another hour, because it would have been my speech. It's 
what happened in Washington State.
<P>
I referenced my manic compulsiveness, and I referenced back to his sacrifice. I turned to my wife 
and said, "Let me remind you of a fellow I worked for out of Texas years ago. He told me as a 
young insurance salesman following my departure from Washington, D.C., having worked for 
President Ford and not winning against President Carter, I had to go get a real job. He said, 'When 
you get out there to sell, don't make your competition angry, because they're going to work real 
hard to beat you if you do.'"
<p>
In 1993, I think the latter occurred, because I left that session, and I said, "This is absurd. This was 
a fraud on the people of the state of Washington. It has been a fraud on my fellow legislators. And, 
by God, we're going to turn this thing around."
<p>
I was not alone. There was a large employer community that became concerned, particularly the 
small business community. It was not only the denouement of the Clinton plan, but the denouement 
of my own business. I had to sell my business. I became preoccupied.
<p>
Over a space of 18 months, I did 168 speeches around the state of Washington. I would talk to 
anybody who would listen to me. It came to the point where I thought I would be wearing a 
sandwich board walking in downtown Seattle. I felt like Don Quixote. I had one Sancho, then two, 
then three, then four. And pretty soon, the windmill was no longer ethereal. It became quite real. 
We started being able to predict, and to see, what the implementation of that law would mean.
<p>
Dr. Heithoff referred to Minnesota's as a staged and incremental plan, not unlike the Clinton health 
care plan. We had the same staging, and, in fact, the time frame is so similar it is scary. Ours was 
implemented July 1, 1993, with final implementation in 1999. This is the frog and water syndrome. 
It is easy to take a frog and throw him into boiling water. The frog is not stupid. There's a 
neurological response: The water is hot, and he jumps out. It's not good for the frog. But put the 
frog in a pan of tepid water and turn the degrees up incrementally over time, and he will sit there 
and cook in his own juice. 
<p>
That was the staging of these Clinton-style health care scenarios in both Washingtons. But it 
became their downfall. It gave us time to get the word out. As I began to tour the state, my 
audiences in the fall of 1993 were this Rotary Club of 20 and that Kiwanis of 25. But by the fall of 
1994, in September and October, I was not speaking to an audience of less than 500.
<p>
<b>Business Interests.</b> The coalitions built by the Association for Washington Business 
included Boeing, Weyerhauser, and Microsoft -- names you all know -- along with the National 
Federation of Independent Business. We soon found that we had strange allies. Organized labor 
began to come on board, starting with the traditional Republican labor organizations of police and 
fire fighters and municipal employees. They were affected because they were no longer ERISA-
protected. They are never ERISA-protected, and they had given up cash wage benefits to negotiate 
nontaxable, noncash benefits in health care for the last 20 years.
<p>
When we showed them what the uniform benefit plan was going to do to their negotiated plan, and 
what the community rating on a one-to-one compression -- just like New York's great plan -- was 
going to do, that they were going to get less and pay more for it, we soon started picking up Boeing 
Aerospace 751 machinists' union. And the next thing you know, instead of a 98-member House 
with 33 Republicans, on the morning of November 9 we had 61 Republicans and 37 Democrats. 
Even more important, conservatives got control of the process.
<P>
<b>Political Change.</b> And I became Chairman of the House Health Care Committee with two 
years under my belt, and they said, "Watch out. He's got the gavel."  Well, "By God," I said, "We're 
going to do it," and we did it.
<p>
We had that bill out of committee in three and a half weeks. It was a 47-page bill; 44 pages were 
repealers. Three pages included three things. The first was continued expansion of our basic health 
plan, which is a complement to the Medicaid asset-based program for providing care to the 
uninsured. We agreed: You have to treat the uninsured. We also had the insurance reforms in there 
-- portability, guaranteed issue, and guaranteed renewability. And then we had MSAs. Beyond that, 
and the repealers, we had a pretty tight bill. 
<p>
We passed the bill through the committee and onto the floor of the House. Then we sat there with a 
slingshot, waiting for the Senate to figure out what they were going to do if we sent it over there. 
They panicked, because we started reminding them of the players who had supported the 1993 act. I 
said, "Can you find one who is vocal about the act being good, who is still elected today?"And with 
half the Senate up next year in 1996, looking around them, realizing they had a one-vote majority 
where they used to have a seven-vote majority in a 49-member Senate, all of a sudden two of the 
Democratic Senators came over and supported my bill. That was all it took.
<p>
We passed it out of the Senate and on to the desk of the Governor, who for two years, arm and arm 
with Bill and Hillary, had been touring the nation's capital as a hero of the populace. He was staring 
us down earlier in the session, saying, "I will veto any changes to my health care act."  He now was 
saying, "Because of the failure of Congress to give me an ERISA waiver, I can't have my plan, so I 
have to make it workable by making this change."  An interesting reversal of theme.
<p>
On April 23 of this year, Governor Lowery signed my bill. It was April 22 of 1993 that the original 
bill passed. I missed it by 24 hours: two years to the day.
<P>
What's next?  We have essentially a level playing field and an opportunity for enfranchisement, to 
bring the public back to the table. They have had an education. The federal health policy debates 
were essential to our success in Washington State because they educated the rank and file through 
the media. All we had to do during the course of the debate was say, "They are, in fact, alike. The 
principles are the same."
<p>
So what am I saying to doctors?  Listening to this morning's discussion, I'm noticing that your 
themes here at The Heritage Foundation are not dissimilar to the themes I see in Washington State.
<P>
Your traditional organized medicine is not always your friend. The Washington State Medical 
Association supported the Washington State health care plan. They had a distinct change in their 
Board of Trustees and their executive management. Politically, family practice physicians and 
specialists were engaged in civil warfare. For years, there had been a balance between primary care 
and specialty care, but in recent years there was no longer a balance; primary care had taken over 
organized medicine, and they were going to stick it to the specialists. 
<p>
And they were going to support this Clinton-style plan because it put them in charge, not realizing 
that we never changed the litigation playing field in the courtroom and that the four-week rotation 
in orthopedics for the primary care doctor is going to be adjudged in a malpractice action by the 
standard set by a board-certified orthopod. They are now beginning to wake up and realize that. Be 
careful what you wish for.
<p>
I also found that organizations like the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which 
had 38 members in Washington State, has now over a thousand in the space of 16 months. Doctors 
were bailing out of the state medical association right and left. Traditional medical organizations 
had been critics of mine for two years but are now giving me every opportunity to speak.
<p>
The animosity between providers and financiers as a result of profits and intrusions in clinical 
standards, and between financiers and providers on utilization controls, employers and financiers on 
premium costs, and employers and financiers or employees and financiers regarding deductibles 
and copays, are only a hint of the battles to come.
<p>
To providers, if you are ahead of the curve, my advice would be to get close to the employer 
community. Managed care organizations don't pay for health care. Employers, 87 percent of them, 
are the source of the funds. Politically, you have to build a relationship to the employer, not to the 
managed care organization.
<p>
In terms of your everyday practice, the challenges yet to come are managed care contract provisions 
that intrude upon your ethics and clinical sovereignty. Most of you have signed, I'll bet, a managed 
care contract that says you cannot criticize the plan to your patient. That is an absolute violation of 
your own ethics. 
<p>
Because you can't write contract standards, how can you get around ERISA and get to those self-
funded plans and not let them have those contracts?  I just gave you the clue. I'll have a bill in 
January that does it using your own licensing boards. It will enable you to make it illegal for 
yourself, under your license, to sign a contract with those provisions that's not ERISA-protected for 
those plans, and no plan can operate without a provider.
<p>
Antitrust has yet to come under safe harbor. It doesn't have the right tolerances, and scoped 
utilization review is my next hope in Washington State, where we don't -- and my apologies, 
because I made the analogy to Texas -- but we don't have an RN in Lubbock, Texas, telling a 
radiologist in Seattle what the standard of care is, and how that patient is going to be treated. I want 
to see utilization review that matches the scope of practice. But it can be superior to subordinate, 
not subordinate to superior, in the rank of scope and training.
<p>
So there's more to come. All we did was take the Nike theme of "Do it,"and just undo it. And now 
we're back to a level playing field, but we have a lot of work to do.

<title>Life With Russell Kirk -- Heritage</title>

<h3>Life With Russell Kirk</h3>

<b>By Annette Kirk</b>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a>, Delivered November 17, 1995
<p>
My estimation of Russell can best be summed up by an incident that occurred several years ago:  
After an especially tiresome travel schedule delivering lectures in several states, Russell returned 
home with a very sore throat. When I phoned the doctor's office to obtain an appointment for him, 
the receptionist said she had no appointments available for at least a month. Hoping to explain the 
urgency of my request, I burst out, "But he's a national treasure; civilization needs him!"
<p>
And so it did and does need the words of Russell Kirk and those other giants who serve as 
guardians of culture, transmitters of our heritage. We are but dwarves standing on the shoulders of 
these giants who provided the philosophical underpinnings of our present political discourse. 
Russell's own significant historical and literary contributions have been widely recorded. As Ken 
Cribb observed, "He lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony from dusty oblivion."
<p>
After almost 30 years of marriage to Russell Kirk, there is simply so much to say that it is hard to 
know where to begin. Russell recounts his life in his memoir, <i>The Sword of Imagination</i> 
(published by Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1995). Today, I will offer my reflections on what life with 
Russell was like, and insight into how his conservative heart shaped his conservative mind.
<p>
Let me begin by answering a question I am often asked:  "Where did you and Russell meet?"  
When I was a junior in college, and president of the student body, I attended many student 
gatherings, at which I met the young men and women who were later to emerge as the leaders of 
the conservative movement. During this time, I became involved in the founding of several 
conservative youth organizations. One snowy Saturday morning in February of 1960, I spoke at a 
conference in Manhattan on a book entitled <i>The American Cause</i>. At the luncheon, I was 
invited to sit next to the author, Russell Kirk. I found him charming and shy and, by dessert, 
discovered that we were kindred spirits. 
<p>
The next year, as a college senior, I arranged lectures for him at my college, as well as at several 
campuses on the east coast. After graduation, I began teaching English and directing dramatic 
productions in a high school on Long Island, while also taking courses for a master's degree and 
remaining politically active. During these years, Russell and I saw each other on many occasions, 
but wrote each other even more often. The two years prior to our marriage, he wrote long missives 
daily -- letters often amusing, but always full of wise insights.
<p>
In addition to writing long letters, Russell also sent me books as gifts -- books such as W.H. 
Mallock's <i>An Immortal Soul</i>, George Gissing's <i>The Private Papers of Henry 
Ryecroft</i>, and <i>The Mind and Heart of Love</i> by the theologian Martin D'Arcy. It was 
this last book, which contrasts the classical concept of love as eros with the Christian concept of 
love as agape, that captured our imagination. We discovered that we both envisioned marriage as a 
vocation, an opportunity to serve not only each other and one's family, but one's community, one's 
culture. To explain how we got from this point of agreement on marriage in the abstract, to my 
writing him a letter agreeing to marry him in particular, would take at least another lecture. So 
suffice it to say that it had long been evident that Russell wished to marry me. Simultaneously, I 
came to the conclusion that I wanted to live all my days with him, to be part of his life, of his world 
-- in short, that I loved him.
<p>
On March 17, 1964, I wrote Russell a letter announcing, "Our marriage is inevitable," which 
sounds rather dour at this distance. Amused, he replied, "Yes, inevitable like death and taxes."  We 
were married on September 19 of that year at my parish chapel, named "Our Lady of the Skies" 
because it was located at, of all places, Kennedy Airport. A zither-player from a restaurant called 
the House of Habsburg performed, and after a small reception at my parents' home, during which 
Bill Buckley held court in the kitchen, we were driven to the airport to depart for our honeymoon in 
a 1929 Rolls-Royce Phantom II hearse, with a bumper-sticker affixed to it proclaiming "Goldwater 
for President."  A classmate of Russell's from St. Andrews University was trying to sell this car and 
was eager to drive us to the church. This seemed a bit much, but not wanting to offend him, we had 
him take us to the airport instead, with our wedding party in the back of the hearse.
<p>
After a brief honeymoon on remote Beaver Island in the middle of Lake Michigan -- a long way 
from the pleasant caf‚s and hectic pace of New York City where we had courted -- we soon 
departed for California, where we feverishly campaigned for Senator Goldwater in the weeks 
before the election. This was the first of many campaigns in which we would be active, attending 
state conventions as delegates and hosting in our home innumerable gatherings for candidates for 
public office.
<p>
In Henry Regnery's preface to the 40th anniversary edition of <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, there 
is a description of Russell as a young man:  "He doesn't say much, about as communicative as a 
turtle, but when he gets behind a typewriter the results are <i>most</i> impressive."
<p>
During the first few years of our acquaintance, I experienced the truth of that statement -- Russell's 
preference for typing rather than talking. If he happened to be in New York when my parents held 
their Sunday evening gathering of conservatives, Russell would come. If he were asked a question, 
he would give an excellent response. When one asked him to tell a story, he kept us in charmed 
awe. Otherwise, he was mostly silent. Within a few days after the gathering, however, once he had 
returned to his typewriter, I would receive a letter from Mecosta containing wonderful comments 
and reflections provoked by our discussions.
<p>
After some years of marriage, one of Russell's assistants put the question to him:  "Dr. Kirk, you 
and Mrs. Kirk are two very different people. Mrs. Kirk is very energetic, always on the move, and 
outgoing. You, on the other hand, are more meditative, stoical, and reserved. How is it that you 
have such a happy marriage?"  Russell replied in his typical manner -- without hesitation and to the 
point -- "What you have said is true -- we are very different. First Principles -- this is the basis of 
our happiness."  Needless to say, the young man was startled to receive such an encapsulated 
answer.
<p>
We did agree on all important matters. Yet, there were two items on which there was some 
contention -- how much the monthly phone bill should be and whether we should drive home the 
70 miles from the airport via the expressway or the scenic route. I'll leave it to you to guess who 
always wanted to take the scenic route.
<p>
Perhaps some background on my education can shed light on Russell's response to the question 
posed to him about our apparent differences, and in doing so touch upon his influence on my mind 
as well as on my heart. When I attended a Catholic college in the late '50s, the curriculum was 
designed to introduce students to first principles, to both the life of the mind and the realm of the 
spirit -- to dispose them to what Newman termed a "philosophical habit of mind."  Philosophy, 
emphasizing logic, and theology, especially apologetics, were then at the core of the curriculum.
<p>
Unlike most of the young men I knew, Russell enjoyed discussing the essential questions in which I 
was interested -- questions such as the metaphysical understanding of "being," the proofs for the 
existence of God, and the meaning and purpose of life. While he agreed that what made man unique 
was his ability to reason and to know the difference between right and wrong, Russell also believed 
that pure reason had its limits and that logical proofs were not needed to validate religious truths. 
He persuaded me that even if a transcendent order were denied in the realm of reason, evidences of 
every sort -- proofs from natural science, history, and physics -- demonstrated that we were part of 
some grand mysterious scheme working upon us providentially.
<p>
Russell introduced me to the "illative sense," an expression employed by Newman to explain a 
method of reasoning beyond logic. The illative sense is constituted by impressions that are borne in 
upon us from a source deeper than our conscious and formal reason. It is the combined product of 
intuition, instinct, imagination, experience, and much reading and meditation. (See <i>The 
Conservative Mind</i>, Chapter VIII, "Conservatism with Imagination:  Disraeli and Newman.") 
Quoting Pascal, Russell often reminded me that "The heart has reasons that the reason does not 
know."
<p>
Russell's emphasis on things of the heart and the hearth became more evident after we were married 
and began to have daughters. So mindful was he of pleasing children that when building an addition 
onto his ancestral home, he instructed the carpenters to place the windows closer to the floor so 
little ones could look out more easily. He also made sure there was a room in a tower that could be 
used as a clubhouse and a winding staircase to a cupola set atop the house allowing them to view 
village fireworks on the Fourth of July. To entertain them he created a garden walk and called it the 
Troll's Path.
<p>
Perhaps an episode that occurred when our first three daughters were young will illustrate Russell's 
enjoyment of everyday life and display how he derived profound insights from ordinary events. In 
his memoirs, which he wrote in the third person, he recounts this tale:
<p><blockquote>
	At Mecosta, snowdrifts persist well into April; when the drifts vanish, the lilacs 
bloom. On the first warm and bright morning of April 1971, there burst out of the 
pantry door of the Old House Monica, aged three; Cecilia, aged two; and Felicia, 
aged eleven months -- the latter two in their pajamas. They commenced to caper and 
sing.
<p>
	Monica, emulated enthusiastically by Cecilia, began piling stones on the back steps. 
"Stones for breakfast!"  she shouted, "We're going to have stones for breakfast 
tonight!"  While Felicia writhed in an endeavor to escape from her father's clutch to 
crawl on the new grass, Cecilia, not to be outdone in fantasy, tried to feed her 
pebbles while exclaiming, "Tones for b'ekfas'!"
<p>
	"Hush!"  said Monica, "I hear a bird!"  Cecilia spied a picturesque insect. Only [her 
father's] prompt exertions prevented Felicia from devouring pebbles in earnest.
<p>
	Returning from the post office, Annette reproved [her husband] for surrendering 
feebly to the desires of their strong-willed daughters who might catch cold outside 
in their pajamas; he protested that their gamboling could not be restrained. Before 
their marriage, Annette had declared that any husband of hers ought to be ready to 
romp with the children. Now she found her Russell all too liberally fulfilling her 
commandment. 
<p>
	In the spring of life, Kirk reflected, nearly everything is wondrous. The fortunate are 
those who have not lost their sense of wonder; who subsist upon the bread of spirit, 
laughing at the stones of dullness and hard materialism.
<p>
	"The life eternal is determined by what one says and does here and now"; so Martin 
D'Arcy had said. With these three playful daughters, that spring morning, Kirk 
enjoyed one of those moments in which time and the timeless intersect:  a glimpse 
of immortality.... 
<p>
	Those men and women who fail to perceive timeless moments are the prisoners of 
time and circumstance. Only by transcending the ravenous ego, and sharing their joy 
with others, do mortals come to know their true enduring selves and to put on 
immortality.
</blockquote><p>
Russell believed that we all long for immortality, for the garden before the fall. Perhaps this is one 
of the reasons why he derived such pleasure from gardening. Our fourth daughter, Andrea, who has 
tended sheep, and shared her father's love of the land, has written:
<p><blockquote>
	When he first took up residence at Piety Hill, my father found the land shaved of its 
lush trees by the family's first settlers, earning it the name "Stump Country."  So to 
make amends for the sins of his ancestors, he planted hundreds of trees on our land 
and in the village. Despite this great number, it seemed as though he could 
remember when each tree was planted and any other interesting detail about it.
<p>
	Agrarian life was well understood and appreciated by my father. Under the dimming 
September sun he and I worked together planting and pruning. He loved to watch 
the progress his labors had achieved; the growth of new life from his ancestral earth. 
The most precious objects in my father's life were his family, his home, and his five 
acres of land.
</blockquote><p>
With Chesterton, Russell believed that all life is an allegory and could be understood only in 
parable. Thus, he relied chiefly on myths, fables, and imaginative tales to teach his children how to 
live in a bent world.
<p>
In an essay entitled "A Literary Patrimony," our second daughter, Cecilia, recalls:
<p><blockquote>
	Night after night my father read aloud to us, all of us delighted by the stories. 
Sometimes we listened for hours. Occasionally, he was even more eager to read 
than we were inclined to listen:  when we fell asleep, we were carried up the 
wooden hill -- the stairs -- to the land of nod.
<p>
	My father also invented his own tales. He related these stories as installments beside 
the fireplace, the traditional place for a community's stories, developing the 
characters and plots as he spoke. We followed "Hew and His Knife," "The Elusive 
Earl," and other tales. Often he would conclude an episode with the protagonists 
caught in a perilous predicament -- surrounded by bandits or the like -- which on 
one occasion so infuriated us that we demanded that he "get those children home to 
their momma."  Laughing, he appeased us with a more satisfactory conclusion.
<p>
	Haunting works, far removed from the tales he told us, my father's published fiction 
often considers the eerie, the macabre, even the diabolic. For the sheer pleasure of 
their evocative titles, I specify: <i>Old House of Fear</i>, <i>The Surly Sullen 
Bell</i>, <i>The Princess of All Lands</i>, <i>Lord of the Hollow Dark</i>, and 
"The Invasion of the Church of the Holy Ghost."  His published fiction and 
unwritten children's tales do, however, share a common element:  the appeal to the 
normative consciousness, touching upon struggles of an ethical nature.
<p></blockquote>

During our three decades together, Russell and I enjoyed the company of dozens of people who 
became, for months or years, part of our extended family. Because of their presence, we were able 
to celebrate more fully holidays, feast-days, and birthdays. At one point, we had so many 
celebrations that Russell conferred upon one of our "little platoon" the distinction of "Mistress of 
Revels."
<p>
Halloween was always an especially festive night. Russell wore his saffron-colored St. Andrews 
academic gown. The village children always referred to him as "The Great Pumpkin."  Later in the 
evening, after the doorbell stopped ringing, he would gather us all around to play an English game 
called "Snapdragon," which involved snatching flaming raisins soaked in brandy from a brass tray 
and eating them while they were still burning.
<p>
During those years, our household included students, refugees, several musicians, and Russell's 90-
year-old aunt, who lived in a log cabin next door. Every day at 5 p.m., tiny Fay Jewell invited all of 
us to join her in her daily drink, a single glass of whiskey and water. The students always liked to 
join her to hear her tales of Mecosta and to take a break from their more scholarly pursuits.
<p>
One could give innumerable examples of Russell's hospitality, shown in large and small acts of 
kindness to others regardless of age or stature. Perhaps the best illustration of this hospitality was 
his acceptance of the hobo who lived with us for six years until he died. A stalwart white-haired 
Viking with piercing blue eyes, Clinton Wallace came to us on probation, having done time for 
stealing from church poor-boxes. He reasoned that he was the poor, and so he was justified in 
taking what he needed. Other than stealing on occasion, his only vices were laziness and buying 
lottery tickets. For years he had kept himself warm while on the road by visiting libraries, where he 
actually read the books. He memorized reams of poetry and loved to recite it at our seminars, 
especially Shakespeare and the <i>Rubiayat of Omar Khayyam</i>. Russell wrote his best and, to 
my mind, most beautiful short story about Clinton and called it "A Long, Long Trail A-Winding."  
In it, the main character, Frank Sarsfield, patterned after Clinton, dies in a snowstorm. Ironically, 
just one year later, Clinton died in a snowstorm, on his way home after seeing the movie "Across 
the Great Divide."  He is buried in our family plot, next to Russell.
<p>
For two decades, we held formal weekend seminars several times a year, sponsored by the 
Intercollegiate Studies Institute. These seminars addressed a wide variety of topics, including "Our 
Classical Patrimony," "Historical Consciousness," "In Search of the American Spirit," "Literature 
in an Ideological Age," and "Can Virtue Be Taught?"  We also held hundreds of informal seminars 
for the many graduate students who lived with us. All together, some two thousand students and 
professors attended these gatherings. 
<p>
Several of these ISI/Piety Hill seminars were held over the New Year's Eve holiday, and so 
naturally called for a celebration. After three days of serious discussion, furniture in the drawing 
room was pushed back to accommodate the dancing of reels, the singing of carols, and the breaking 
of a pi¤ata. The most memorable of these New Year's Eve seminars was the one attended by Kitty 
and Malcolm Muggeridge. The topic was "Pilgrims in the Dark Wood of Our Time."  It was an 
awesome experience to hear Muggeridge reflect upon his fascinating life, to take walks in the 
snowy woods, returning to drink hot cider before the fireplace in Russell's library -- the barn-like 
structure in which all such seminars were held and where Russell did almost all of his writing for 
40 years.
<p>
His writing, or "scribbling," as he referred to it, resulted in 30 books, 500 <i>National Review</i> 
articles, 2,500 newspaper columns, and 400 essays. He also wrote introductions and prefaces to 
countless numbers of books, and edited 30 titles for his series "The Library of Conservative 
Thought."
<p>
Russell was never a dry-as-dust type of scholar. He departed from academe early on and instead 
strove to write evocative prose which spoke to a larger audience, one he identified as "the common 
reader."  He deemed it urgent to speak to this group -- which might include scholars, but mainly 
consisted of people in commerce, the professions, public officials, parents, or students. He wished 
to reach those who perceived that civilization had lost its object, its aim or end, had become 
decadent. He sought to articulate this loss, and to give hope that renewal was possible, to 
continually remind us that for there to be outer order in society, there must be inner order in the 
souls of its members.
<p>
Russell desired us to recognize that a conservative disposition always displays piety toward the 
wisdom of its ancestors. Piety, by which he meant reverence not merely for things spiritual, but also 
for habit, custom, tradition, and history, provides us with an understanding of the limits of our 
intellect and leaves us open to the paradoxes and mysteries of life. Of piety, Richard Weaver has 
said:
<p><blockquote>
	[I]t seems to me that it signifies an attitude toward things which are immeasurably 
larger and greater than oneself without which man is an insufferably brash, 
conceited, and frivolous animal. I do not in truth see how societies are able to hold 
together without some measure of this ancient but now derided feeling.... The 
realization that piety is a proper and constructive attitude... helped me to develop 
what Russell Kirk calls "affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of 
traditional life."... [This realization] was for me a kind of recovery of lost power or 
lost capacity for wonder and enchantment.
</blockquote><p>
It seems significant that the last book Russell published before he died was <i>The Politics of 
Prudence</i>, a selection from the 60 lectures he gave here at The Heritage Foundation over a 
period of 16 years. The last chapter of this book is entitled, "May the Rising Generation Redeem 
the Time?"  One reviewer wrote:  "There is something fitting about Russell Kirk addressing the 
younger generation... because there is a remarkable youthfulness about Russell Kirk himself.... His 
impishness, his capacity for wonder and delight, his intellectual enthusiasm, his freedom from 
academic cant -- all make him the ideal pedagogue for the next generation of conservatives."  Of 
those Heritage lectures, Ed Feulner commented:  "I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable 
overflow crowd of young people who couldn't get enough of him. I asked one of them what his 
hold was on them.... [A] young Reagan appointee said, 'He taught us all why our role was important 
beyond ourselves and beyond politics.'" 
<p>
Russell did not live to see the great congressional victory of '94. While he would have been pleased 
at this turn of events, he would have cautioned us to place this triumph in perspective. Probably, he 
would have approved the "Contract with America," but he would have reminded us of another 
contract, which joins in the community of souls those dead, those living, and those yet to be born -- 
the contract of eternal society.
<p>
This understanding of being part of a "community of souls" was very much evident in a eulogy for 
her father delivered by our third daughter, Felicia:
<p><blockquote>
	My father was delighted at my discovery at the age of fifteen of the Afrikaaner 
writer Sir Laurens van der Post. One of the first books of the many he presented to 
my mother before they were married was <i>The Seed and the Sower</i> by van 
der Post, whom he considered "a wise man."
<p>
	As my interest in the works of Sir Laurens grew, my father began searching his 
favorite book shops and catalogues for anything of a similar topic. On my last 
birthday I received eighteen books in this field. He often sent me postcards, typed of 
course, relating his progress in this endeavor. Our talks were of the bushman and his 
myths, of the land of Ethiopia, and the wonder of the world.
<P>
	This was the original basis of our friendship -- a bond of two of "God's spies," who 
did indeed as Shakespeare wrote in <i>King Lear</i>:  "live, and pray, and sing, 
and tell old tales and laugh at gilded butterflies... and take upon's the mystery of 
things."
<p>
	At our last Christmas gathering my father gave me a tape of an interview with Sir 
Laurens entitled "From the Heart."  We watched it together and listened to Sir 
Laurens speak of the prospect of his impending death and how after seeing "people 
of all races, of all cultures, and of all conditions die" [it was extraordinary to see 
how] "a certain majesty and dignity inside the human spirit comes to take people on 
to the end."  This was the way my father met death -- with reverence and dignity. 
What stories we'll have to tell, God willing, when next we meet!
</blockquote><p>
Being with Russell was never boring. Because he viewed life as a perpetual adventure and loved so 
deeply, we were continually surprised by joy. Through my reflections and through the words of 
others, especially his daughters, I have tried to reveal the essence of his mind and heart, which 
continues on in the legacy that he has left us.
<p>
Perhaps our eldest daughter, Monica, best expressed our family's thoughts on life with Russell:  
"My father was a great intellectual and a distinguished writer. He was a teller of ghostly tales and a 
planter of trees. He was a devoted husband and loving father. But above all, in his words and in his 
actions, my father was a gentleman. Even when he was in considerable pain, my father never lost 
his gracious dignity. When I made a commitment to help my mother care for my father in his 
illness, I knew that it was my duty. I now realize that it was an honor."
<p>
For those of us who knew and loved Russell Kirk, the promulgation of his wise words is both a 
duty and an honor. In this regard, T.S. Eliot's words seem especially appropriate:  "The 
communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living."

<title>The Duma Elections: Russian Reformers Beware -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE DUMA ELECTIONS: RUSSIAN REFORMERS BEWARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies<sup>1 </sup><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 443<br>
December 29, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The elections to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, on December 17 
demonstrated that democratic politics are beginning to take root in Russia. A healthy majority of 
eligible voters participated, and the political elites are learning that they must appeal to them. 
However, many voters clearly are frustrated with the hardships of economic transition, crime, and 
corruption. The impressive performance by Gennady Zyuganov's communists at the polls, and the 
high public opinion ratings of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky as a presidential candidate, 
indicate that the pro-market forces may lose control of the executive branch in the June 1996 
presidential elections. If this occurs, there is a danger that the 1995 elections will be the first and the 
last free and "clean" parliamentary elections in Russia for a long time.
<p>
<b>More Hardline Duma.</b> Half of the Duma (225 seats) is elected by party lists. To win 
seats in this half, parties had to gain more than five percent of the popular vote. Only four parties 
met this test. The Russian voters gave the communists 22 percent and Zhirinovsky's "Liberal 
Democratic" Party of Russia (LDPR) 11 percent. The centrist Our Home is Russia, headed by 
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, received 10 percent of the vote, and the reformist 
<i>Yabloko</i> Party led by economist Grigory Yavlinsky just over 7 percent. This means that the 
communists, together with their allies, now have about 30 percent of the votes, and the nationalists, 
over 17 percent.
<p>
The other half of the Duma is made up of single-seat constituencies, in which the candidate with the 
majority of votes in the district takes the parliamentary post. In these single-mandate districts, the 
voters elected 77 independent (unaffiliated) candidates, 58 communists, 20 deputies from the 
Agrarian Party (which is closely tied to the communists), 14 from <i>Yabloko</i>, and 10 from 
Our Home is Russia. Former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's reformist Democratic Choice 
of Russia and the communist-nationalist Power to the People party, led by former USSR Prime 
Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, won 9 seats each. Zhirinovsky's LDPR took only one seat. A few seats 
in the single-mandate districts were gained by members of smaller parties which did not clear the 
five percent barrier. 
<p>
Out of the total of 450 Duma seats, the communists lead with 150 seats, while LDPR, Our Home is 
Russia, and <i>Yabloko</i> all have approximately 50 each. Given these figures, the communists 
most probably will manage to appoint a chairman and take control of several key committees. The 
leadership of the Duma will consist of the chairman and leaders of the factions which will be 
formed. Given its composition, the Duma is likely to prove confrontational toward the executive 
branch.
<p>
<b>Achievement for Russian Democracy.</b> The 1995 democratic process was more 
transparent and fair than in 1993: this Duma was elected for a full four-year term; no parties were 
banned from running, and a total of 42 parties and movements participated in the race. The 1993 
Duma was elected for two years only, and several parties were banned from running after the 
Russian Supreme Soviet was disbanded by Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
The Russian public showed maturity by heeding the call to participate in the voting process. The 
voting rate was a respectable 65 percent, 15 percentage points higher than in 1993. The lowest 
voting rate was among the young, who tended to cast their ballots for democrats, Zhirinovsky, or 
centrists, but not for the communists. Older voters leaned more heavily toward the communists.
<p>
The elections were "clean" by Russian standards. This is the assessment of foreign and Russian 
observers and of the generally free mass media. There were very few reports of minor tampering 
with the process; three candidates, however, were killed or died in suspicious traffic accidents. 
<p>
There were quite a few surprises in the elections. A number of parties had been expected to do 
better. Among these were Gaidar's Democratic Choice of Russia (4.1 percent), Women of Russia 
(4.6 percent), and the Congress of Russian Communities led by the charismatic General Alexander 
Lebed (4.3 percent). 
<p>
The poor performance of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia suggests that the 
voters do not trust the government's execution of reforms, and they are tired of the ubiquitous crime 
and corruption. Our Home is Russia won the most votes in Moscow (20 percent), where the 
country's capital is most heavily concentrated, and where the reforms already have produced wealth 
and opportunity. (Almost all of Moscow's single-mandate districts returned democratic candidates.) 
Voters in the provinces, where the reforms have not yet generated jobs and have weakened the 
social safety net, gave the communists and nationalists their heaviest gains.
<p>
<b>The Presidency: Yeltsin Still in the Running.</b> Many Russians believe that the Duma 
elections were but a dress rehearsal for the real political fight that will take place in the presidential 
elections next summer. The Duma elections highlighted Communist Party chief Zyuganov and his 
ability to command the still-formidable Party machine. They also showcased Zhirinovsky's shrewd 
political instincts, setting him up as the other presidential front-runner in June. On the other hand, 
Alexander Lebed, whose ads featured the General shooting an arsenal of infantry weapons, has 
shown that he is a better soldier than a politician. 
<p>
According to public opinion polls, both Chernomyrdin and President Boris Yeltsin are not favored 
to do well if they run for president. Both men are in their sixties in a country where the average 
male life expectancy is only 57. Yeltsin's ill health remains a central theme in Russian politics. 
Nevertheless, well-informed sources in Moscow predict that he will still run in June, even though 
he trails Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, Lebed, and Yavlinsky in the presidential election ratings.
<p>
Yegor Gaidar's poor showing eliminated him as the presidential hopeful of the Russian center-right. 
Grigory Yavlinsky, who consistently has distanced himself from the Yeltsin administration and 
won high personal approval rating among the voters, remains the only democratic presidential 
hopeful. However, he will need to work hard to win the first round of presidential elections by 
becoming a consensus candidate of the reformers -- not a very likely development. 
<p>
<b>Conclusion.</b> The fight for Russia's democratic future is far from over. The democrats and 
reformers are split and hardly capable of resisting the dual nationalist and communist threat. While 
the elections showed that Russians can behave like good democrats, they showed also that voters 
do not necessarily elect good democrats. The reformers have to increase their popular appeal, and 
do it very fast. If these had been presidential elections, Gennady Zyuganov would now be the leader 
of Russia and working to turn back the clock, with disastrous consequences for his own country and 
her neighbors near and far. Come June, this may be a very real scenario if democrats do not unite.

<title>Keeping Faith with the Troops: Why Clinton Should Sign the DoD Bill -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>KEEPING FAITH WITH THE TROOPS:
WHY CLINTON SHOULD SIGN THE DOD BILL</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 442<br>
December 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

On December 19, the Senate approved the Department of Defense authorization bill, sending it to 
President Bill Clinton for his signature. The bill authorizes national security programs for both the 
Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1996. 
<p>
President Clinton, however, has threatened to veto the defense bill. The President objects to the 
bill's provisions banning abortions at military hospitals, discharging military personnel with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and earmarking funds for shipbuilding and other programs. 
But his biggest problem appears to be the bill's demand that the nation begin building defenses 
against ballistic missiles. Clinton is prepared to sacrifice the entire DOD bill -- one that raises pay 
for U.S. troops, including those being deployed to Bosnia -- because he cannot tolerate a bill that 
demands protection for the American people against missile attack.
<p>
The President needs to take a step back from his thoughtless threat to veto the DOD bill. Too much 
is at stake to play politics with the nation's security and the lives and well-being of U.S. troops 
overseas. He should sign the DOD bill because it:
<p>
<b>Supports the troops in Bosnia.</b> President Clinton has argued tirelessly that the nation 
needs to support U.S. troops in Bosnia. He is right. But how can he demand that others support the 
troops while he vetoes the very bill that authorizes funds for the troops?  The Department of 
Defense authorization bill establishes the legal foundation for all the programs necessary to conduct 
Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia. These include programs for military pay, operations, and 
procurement, as well as many intelligence programs. While many of these programs already are 
funded through the Department of Defense appropriations bill, which was approved earlier, their 
proper management still requires authorization.
<p>
<b>Improves the quality of life for military personnel.</b> The Defense authorization bill 
provides a 2.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for military pay and a 5.2 percent increase 
in funding for housing allowances. A presidential veto will block the full implementation of these 
adjustments in pay and benefits. The White House statement on the authorization bill indicates that 
the President supports these adjustments, but his threat of a veto implies otherwise. Why would a 
President who vetoes an entire federal budget bill because it does not provide increases in benefits 
to Medicare beneficiaries at the rate he desires not give the same consideration to military personnel 
by signing the Department of Defense authorization bill?  Military personnel -- particularly troops 
risking their lives in Bosnia -- deserve at least the same level of presidential support as Medicare 
beneficiaries.
<p>
<b>Funds the Bottom-Up Review force.</b> In 1993, President Clinton adopted a new defense 
policy and force structure following the Pentagon's Bottom-Up Review (BUR). The Clinton 
Administration's defense budget, however, does not provide enough funding to support the force 
structure recommended in the BUR. The White House states that because the Defense authorization 
bill provides almost $7 billion more in funding for defense than the President requested, he is 
opposed to it. But all Congress has done is attempt to fund the Clinton Administration's own 
defense program. A presidential veto would mean that, in effect, the Clinton Administration is 
disowning its long-range defense program.
<p>
<b>Modernizes the force.</b> President Clinton has stated on a number of occasions that he 
wants to maintain the technological superiority enjoyed by the U.S. military at the time he entered 
office. But the defense procurement account, which is the primary account for providing modern 
weapons to the military, has fallen by more than two thirds since 1985. Whereas procurement 
funding consumed almost 34 percent of the Pentagon's budget in fiscal 1985, by fiscal 1995 it had 
fallen to 17 percent. Most of the congressional add-ons go to the procurement account. Congress 
believes that cutting procurement too fast will erode the nation's superiority in military technology. 
A presidential veto would mean that the President has decided to fritter away this technological 
edge.
<P>
<b>Defends America.</b> The most outrageous complaint leveled by the White House at the 
Department of Defense authorization bill is the objection against the bill's provision to deploy a 
national missile defense system. President Clinton has ordered 20,000 troops to Bosnia because it 
supposedly serves the national interest. At the same time, the Clinton Administration has stated that 
a national missile defense system will not serve the national interest. The President apparently sees 
a national interest in sending U.S. troops to a conduct a dubious mission in remote Bosnia but 
cannot see one in defending the American people here at home against missile attack. This defies 
logic and common sense. It also is morally irresponsible. Why should the lives and security of 
Bosnians be more precious that those of Americans?
<p>
The White House states further that a decision to deploy a missile defense system will jeopardize 
the reduction of nuclear forces in Russia. Its argument: Deploying defenses supposedly will cause 
the Russian Duma to deny ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II ). 
START II would reduce U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals each to 3,500 warheads. The 
U.S. Senate is likely to approve ratification of the treaty in the coming days or weeks.
<p>
The likelihood of approval of START II by the Russian Duma is indeed remote. But this dismal 
outlook for START II has little to do with a decision by the U.S. Congress to deploy missile 
defenses and everything to do with a view popular in the Duma, especially in the aftermath of 
recent elections under the sway of Communists and nationalists, that the Russian nuclear force is a 
useful tool for coercing other nations, including the U.S. By what twisted logic can someone blame 
the U.S. Congress for the demise of START II in the Russian Duma?  Anyone familiar with 
Russian politics knows that the Communists, nationalists, and military-industrial complex oppose 
START II because they want to keep Russia's strategic arsenal strong, not because they feel 
threatened by America's desire to defend itself against Russian missiles.
<p>
In national security policy, a President must mean what he says. Bill Clinton claims to support U.S. 
troops in Bosnia, but his threat to veto the Defense authorization bill belies his professed regard for 
their well-being and their purpose. He says he supports increases in military pay and benefits, but a 
veto of the DOD bill would deny the troops these increases. The White House pretends to have a 
long-range defense plan -- its much-ballyhooed Bottom-Up Review -- but a defense veto would 
make it all but impossible to fund the President's own program. Clinton insists that he wants to 
preserve America's lead in military technology, but his draconian cuts in military procurement 
would devastate the military's ability to stay on the cutting edge of technology. Finally, the 
President has declared his intention to protect the vital national interests of the U.S., but he would 
veto a bill that attempts to protect the American people against the growing possibility of missile 
attack.
<p>
The President's actions speak louder than words. His promises have proven to be empty. It is time 
for Bill Clinton to make good on his promises, and his words, by signing the Department of 
Defense authorization bill.

<title>Updated Estimates of the Costs to States of Not Reforming Medicaid -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>UPDATED ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS TO THE STATES OF NOT REFORMING MEDICAID AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF ADOPTING PER CAPITA CAPS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br> 
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 81<br>
December 18, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

The Congressional Budget Office revised its seven-year projections of federal Medicaid outlays on December 12, 1995. CBO made these revisions in order to reflect how the effect of lower forecasted inflation will reduce the federal government's Medicaid obligations. These lower inflation numbers also reduce the additional revenues the states must find over the next seven years (1996 through 2002) in order to meet their Medicaid obligations. The accompanying <a href="fyi81.gif">table</a> shows The Heritage Foundation's revised estimates of these additional state Medicaid obligations.<sup>1</sup><p>
1) If no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations. This estimate is $27.8 billion less than the earlier Heritage estimate of $174.2 billion.
<p>
2) If the Congress and the Administration adopt the "per capita cap" proposal advanced by a group of moderate Democrats, the preliminary Heritage analysis indicates that states may need to raise an additional $47.4 billion in new revenues or spending cuts on top of the $146 billion increase. 
<p>
3) The total cost to the states of the current law plus "reforms" made on a per capita cap basis is likely to be $193.8 billion.
<p>
The projections of additional state obligations under current law were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. In these state-by-state Medicaid models, total Medicaid program spending is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. The baseline models were then adjusted to reflect CBO's forecasts of federal Medicaid outlays. Heritage's estimates of additional per capita cap costs are preliminary results of adaptations made to the baseline state models.

<center><h3><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h3></center>
	The Senate soon will vote on legislation authorizing $673 million in aid to Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS) in FY 1996 and another $619 million in FY 1997.<p>

	In making this vote, the Senate will face some difficult choices. Foreign aid is more unpopular than ever, and aid to Russia, Ukraine, and other post-Soviet states is coming under heavy scrutiny. Moreover, U.S.-Russian cooperation is ebbing. Moscow's refusal to stop the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran has made it difficult to justify aid to Russia. So, too, has Russia's heavy-handed intervention in Chechnya.<p>

	Given these circumstances, Russian aid should be re-examined and applied to areas that not only make a difference, but also fit into an overall strategic plan. Properly applied, the transfer of market and democratic "know-how" can promote U.S. interests in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, increasing Russia's chances for a smooth transition to democracy and a free market. Therefore, Congress should continue aid to support the growth of democratic capitalism in Russia. This aid should be used to help democratic reformers, who face growing challenges from extremists. The most important programs in achieving this goal are those that develop market institutions, foster economic reform and privatization, and enhance the rule of law and democratic politics. <p>

	In addition, U.S. assistance in dismantling the former Soviet nuclear arsenal (the Nunn-Lugar program) should continue. Americans see reducing the Russian strategic threat as a worthwhile investment in U.S. security. However, this program should not be a sacred cow. The U.S. General Accounting Office and independent writers have reported serious flaws in this program, such as the use of U.S. taxpayers' funds for Russia's nuclear modernization and defense conversion. These flaws must be remedied. Congress should refocus the Nunn-Lugar program on its original purpose -- dismantling the Russian nuclear, chemical, and biological arsenal.<p>

	While fostering democratic capitalism in Russia serves U.S. national interests, many of the aid programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) do not. They often are poorly conceived and executed. For the last thirty years, AID and its traditional contractors have not worked in Eastern and Central Europe. Instead, they have operated in the Third World. As a result, AID officials and contractors lack the area and linguistic expertise needed to support the great post-communist transformation in Europe and the NIS. AID needs to upgrade its regional skills in the NIS, focus more of its efforts on developing democratic capitalism, and ensure that more aid funds go to Russian reformers, and not to American bureaucrats and experts.<p>

	As the Senate considers aid to Russia and the NIS, it should add conditions to this aid and refocus the program to make it more effective and relevant to the particular needs of its recipients. Specifically, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The reactor sale is on hold pending negotiations between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could block the Clinton Administration's agreement to reschedule Russia's debt if the sale to Iran goes through.<p>

<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on a cease-fire in Chechnya. If Russia wants to be treated as a civilized member of the Western alliance, it must end the war in Chechnya. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could condition IMF or World Bank appropriations on the Russian government's compliance with a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict in Chechnya.<p>

<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. This board could set clear goals for U.S. aid to Russia and uphold democratic development as one of its top priorities. The Senate could help create this board by amending the foreign aid authorization bill.<p>

<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. The $90 million CIP is a giveaway for U.S. businesses selling oil and gas technology to Russian industry. It should be eliminated and the funds used to further democracy in Russia, as should the $135 million earmarked for housing displaced Russian military officers. <p>

<li>Make democratic development a top priority. By amending the authorization bill, the Senate could demand that the Russian aid program focus exclusively on the development of democracy, the rule of law, and free markets. Many of AID's programs are unfocused, ineffective, and all too often intended to advance pet liberal causes, not democratic capitalism.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS. Russians receive very little American help in fighting against human rights violations, media censorship, or racism, Most of the funds go to Americans purporting to help Russians, but Russian democrats can do far more with this money than American  "experts."<p>
</ul>


<a name="seige"><h3><center>RUSSIAN DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM UNDER SIEGE</h3></a></center>

	Russian democracy and free markets are in deep crisis. Ten years after the beginning of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, members of the former Communist Party elite still control the levers of power in Moscow as well as in the provinces. They are also in charge of Russia's vast properties and natural resources. Chaotic privatization has given many former Communist Party officials personal ownership of factories and other assets over which they used to exercise only administrative control. <p>

	The influence of old Soviet bureaucracy extends to foreign trade, the privatization process, and the issuing of business licenses. Russians often say that government bureaucrats, not entrepreneurs, are the richest people in the land. This elite may have given up its Marxist slogans, but it remains deeply committed to state intervention, government regulation, and the unbridled exercise of power. More often than not, Russian nationalism is touted in place of Marxist internationalism as a cover for the same old thing --   personal greed. <p>

	Ordinary Russians are deeply and understandably disenchanted with the direction reforms have taken. The majority of the population has lost interest in the political process, as evidenced by the low turnout of less than 25 percent in the most recent local and regional elections.<p>

	Support for political extremists on both the left and right is growing. Moreover, an increasing number of voters have cast their ballots for Russian Communist Party (RCP) candidates in recent elections. Running on an anti-government, anti-establishment, and anti-corruption platform, the communists are a favorite for the December 1995 elections to the Duma, the lower house of Parliament.<p>

	The Military Wild Card. The Russian armed forces also are disenchanted with the reform process. They oppose a Western-style democracy for Russia and yearn for a ruler with a "strong hand."  Military troops voted heavily for ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in December 1993. The armed forces today are polarized between the majority of the officer corps, who believe that the military is grossly mismanaged, and a small group of generals around Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who use their positions for personal enrichment. The Russian Army feels defeated and nostalgic for the Soviet period, when it enjoyed high status and large budgets. <p>

	This situation has been made worse by the war in Chechnya, in which tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have participated in killing citizens of their own country. In the 1980s, veterans of the Afghan war contributed to the swelling ranks of Russian organized crime. They also flooded the extremist nationalist movements. This could well be repeated after Chechnya, further destabilizing Russia's feeble democracy.<p>

	Authoritarian Renaissance. Democracy is under siege as well. The Yeltsin administration has done little to promote the rule of law in Russia. It rammed through the 1993 Constitution, establishing an "imperial" presidency with little but an advisory role for Parliament. Such democratic reformers as former Acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Vice Prime Minister Gennadii Burbulis, Human Rights Commissioner Sergei Kovalev, Ethnic Policy Advisor Galina Starovoitova, and many others have been pushed out of the government. The most influential group in the Kremlin today includes Yeltsin's Chief of Bodyguards, General Alexander Korzhakov, and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who is in charge of the military-industrial complex. Even Yeltsin's Chief of Staff, Sergei Filatov, has complained that presidential aides are forced to communicate by writing notes to each other because their phones and rooms are wiretapped.<p>

	The political role and power of Russia's historically strong spy agencies are growing. In September 1994, the Foreign Intelligence Service, headed by KGB veteran General Evgenii Primakov, published its own policy statement advocating strengthened Russian domination of the whole area of the former Soviet Union, the so-called near abroad. According to Primakov's agency, Russia must re-consolidate all the Newly Independent States under its tutelage regardless of the West's opposition.<p>

	On April 6, 1995, President Yeltsin signed the State Duma law reorganizing the secret police, then called the Federal Counterintelligence Service and known by its Russian acronym, FSK (Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki). This agency, the successor to the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB, is now called the Federal Security Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, or FSB). It has been granted wide powers to conduct investigations and perform surveillance in total secrecy. The scope of its activities was broadened to cover a wide range of internal security threats ranging from organized crime to political extremism to corruption.<p>

	Threats to Free Media. The Yeltsin administration is tightening its control over the electronic media, especially the national television stations. The provincial media also are under heavy pressure from the local chiefs of administration, who have been pressured by Yeltsin to "toe the line."  In late 1993, former Pravda journalist Boris Mironov was appointed chairman of the State Committee on Press. Before he was fired in the fall of 1994, Mironov funneled huge subsidies to hard-line ultra-nationalist newspapers. "If to be a Russian nationalist means to be a fascist, then I am a fascist," he said.<p>

	Vlad Listyev, Director General of the largest Russian TV network and a popular talk show host, was gunned down in the entrance to his apartment building on March 1, 1995. On October 17, 1994, investigative reporter Dmitrii Kholodov of Moskovskii Komsomoletz was murdered by an exploding briefcase. Kholodov was investigating corruption in the military at the time. Others have been slain while investigating organized crime. Journalists in the regions have been tortured and killed. The print media are coming under increasing pressure, as the Moscow government owns printing presses and manipulates the prices of newsprint as well as subsidies to newspapers. <p>

	The Russian government continues to play a dubious role in the media scene. It refuses to privatize television stations and printing plants. The official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta publishes anonymous attacks on Yeltsin's opponents, such as media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, who has been accused of launching a "putsch" against Yeltsin. Formerly allied with democratic presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky and Moscow mayor Yurii Luzhkov, Gusinsky is a political foe of a powerful group in Yeltsin's entourage. The State Duma thus far has failed to eliminate the right of the government to establish media outlets, while it has expanded the list of circumstances under which the government is empowered to shut them down.<p>

	Criminalization of Politics. Rising crime also is endangering democracy in Russia. The recent gangland-style murder of three Duma deputies may have been the work of professional hired killers. So far, no arrests have been made. Moreover, a senior Russian Interior Ministry expert warns against the growing influence of Russian mafiosi "among law enforcement organs and other organs of power."Whole areas of Russia are becoming the domain of organized crime. But the Yeltsin administration is notoriously ineffective in fighting crime and corruption. Despite draconian decrees, known criminal figures remain unpunished and free to penetrate the Russian body politic. At the same time, the hard-liners are exploiting the public's fear of lawlessness to advance their own political goals.<p>

	Organized crime is reaching the highest echelons of power. In the summer of 1994, a Moscow mafia don, Otari Kvantrishvili, was killed by a sniper's bullet. Kvantrishvili headed a powerful political party, Sportsmen of Russia, which was better organized and financed than some legitimate parties represented in the Duma. A prominent criminal, Vladimir Podatev from Khabarovsk, nicknamed "the Poodle," is launching a national political career by becoming a member of the Presidential Public Chamber Human Rights Commission. Podatev is also the leader of a local political movement called Unity, a first step toward attaining office in a national election.<p>

	The Fascist Threat. Extremist Russian nationalism, often identified as neo-Nazism or fascism, is another threat to Russian democracy. The nationalists comprise a broad spectrum, from Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party, which is well-represented in the Duma, to the National Republican Party of Nicholas Lysenko, who was elected to the Duma by a St. Petersburg district. Zhirinovsky's delegates comprise 22 percent of the State Duma. Altogether, the nationalists are expected to get over 30 percent of the vote in the December 1995 elections.<p>

	Nationalists also find political support from Gennadii Ziuganov's communists and Vladimir Barkashov's Russian National Unity movement. The nationalists are united in their hatred of the United States and the West. Some are anti-Semitic, while others passionately hate dark-skinned "Caucasians" -- Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, and Central Asians.<p>

	Russian fascists are involved in extensive paramilitary training programs, conducted with the full knowledge and complacent inaction of the authorities. One of their most important leaders, judo black belt Vladimir Barkashov, claims to have 10,000 well-trained fighters under his command. The Russian security services put this number at 2,000. Other organizations, such as Zhirinovsky's Falcons, the Werewolf Legion, the National Republicans, and Pamyat, have from several dozen to several hundred stormtroopers each.<p>

	Unfortunately, some officials in Russia's law enforcement agencies, including KGB spin-offs, the police, and even the prosecutor's office, often sympathize with and support political extremists. Defectors from Barkashov's organization warn that a deliberate attempt by the neo-Nazis to penetrate the military and security services is under way.<p>

	Russian law enforcement and security services are incompetent in fighting ultra-nationalists as they are in combating organized crime. For example, the police failed to keep Alexei Vedenkin, a prominent Russian fascist, in pre-trial detention after he pledged on national television to kill Duma Defense Committee Chairman Sergei Yushenkov and Yeltsin Human Rights Commissioner Sergei A. Kovalev. After two weeks in jail, he was released by a Moscow judge on a technicality. Meanwhile, Vedenkin's Russian National Movement has bought up a large packet of shares in the Siren Three consortium, which will control plane ticket reservations all over Russia and the former Soviet Union.<p>


<a name="nis"><h3><center>WHY AID RUSSIA AND THE NIS?</h3>
</a></center>
	Despite the rocky road to reform, Russia has not reverted to its old-style totalitarian ways. Nor is it an ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Despite the chaos of its transition, there are reasons for hope. Privatization has allowed many Russians to acquire or start small businesses. Others have become owners of Soviet-era factories. More Russians are employed today in the private sector than at any time since 1917. The reforms in Ukraine are about to take hold. The nascent capital markets and commodity exchanges are breeding rough-and-tumble capitalists -- the kind that build personal fortunes. The entrepreneurial class is more involved in politics than ever. Pressure to formalize the legal infrastructure needed to conduct business is growing.<p>

	Political pluralism also is growing. There are at least ten large political parties or movements in Russia. In addition, dozens of political parties will compete in the December 1995 elections. The independent media are providing blunt and courageous coverage of Chechnya, despite government attempts to manipulate them. While some Russians yearn for a "strong hand," 70 percent want democratic elections and a free press. Moreover, support for reforms is highest where it matters most -- among urban educated citizens under the age of 35.<p>

	Nor has Russia embarked upon a Bolshevik-style retaking of the former Russian empire as it did under Lenin and Stalin. The Russian military is bogged down in Chechnya and Central Asia. Despite calls from nationalists to rebuild the USSR, ineptitude and corruption in the army and the lack of popular will to pay the price do not bode well for Russian revanchists. After Chechnya, the Russian leadership probably will think twice before ordering tanks into any other rebellious area. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's repeated attempts to distance himself from the fiasco in the Caucasus, and the Duma's     relentless attacks on President Yeltsin over Chechnya, indicate that Russia's elites are  seeking new ways to settle political crises.<p>

	Almost eighty years ago the West abandoned Russia to the Bolsheviks. Today, it is in America's interest to encourage Russia to follow a new direction and make its domestic and international behavior more benign. At the same time, the U.S. should support the independence and viability of the other post-Soviet states as a balance against a possible Russian resurgence. Reformers in Moscow, Kiev, and other parts of the NIS have asked repeatedly not only for technical assistance to build democratic and market institutions, but also for support of non-governmental alternatives to state services and functions. Properly implemented, U.S. assistance should be fulfilling these needs. <p>

	The crisis of Russian democracy is deep, but there is hope. U.S. assistance to democrats in Russia and parts of the NIS possibly could help end this crisis. Without U.S. aid, however, it will only get worse.<p>


<a name="bird"><h3><center>AID'S INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS:<br> TOO MUCH BIG BIRD, TOO LITTLE DEMOCRACY</h3>
</a></center>
	Saying that aid can make a difference in Russia is one thing. Saying that current aid programs are doing the job is another. Many current U.S. aid programs to Russia and the NIS are not doing the job. They are often ineffective and should be reorganized. As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has noted: <p>

	[M]uch of AID's technical assistance effort in the New Independent States and Central and Eastern Europe has produced little positive result. Closed procurement practices and AID's own lack of experience in the region has too often led to the awarding of contracts to organizations who themselves have little regional or area competence. In many instances, AID has relied on its network of contractors which have experience in the poorest developing nations. The result has often been wasteful expenditures on contractor field office infrastructure, poor recruitment of participants and expensive, and misdirected short-term training in the United States which has had negative impact on NIS professionals participating in the program.<p>

	Certainly the problem has not been lack of money. Congress has appropriated almost $3.7 billion in aid to Russia since the assistance program began in 1992. Out of these funds, AID obligated $2.5 billion, but only $1.2 billion has been spent. In addition, only $126 million was obligated and $49 million spent on "democratic pluralism initiatives" in the whole of the NIS (see Appendix). Funds for building democracy in the NIS comprised only about 5 percent of AID's total budget; by contrast, management costs make up about 5 percent to 10 percent. Clearly, promoting democracy is AID's budgetary stepchild.<p>

	While some AID programs are successful, many are expensive, lack a coherent overall strategy, and are ill-conceived and poorly executed. For example, not a single U.S. law school or law office received AID funds to execute an AID-sponsored program in the NIS. Yet establishing the rule of law is one of the most important prerequisites of democracy. AID's rule of law program has been severely criticized by legal professionals both in Russia and the U.S. They argue that too few lawyers, lawmakers, judges, and prosecutors have been involved to make a significant impact. The program does not sponsor the long-term education of Russian lawyers in U.S. law schools. Nor has AID succeeded in placing a significant number of American legal advisors in Russian ministries, the Duma, or the Supreme and Constitutional Courts. American jurists have had precious little impact on Russian legislation and regulations.<p>

	Instead of providing adequate support for rule of law programs, what has AID been doing?  Funding Big Bird in Russia. Despite the fact that Russia already produces superb children's films and television programs, AID has granted $2 million to the Children's Television Workshop, a money-making venture affiliated with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, to produce a Russian version of the American TV program Sesame Street. Why does a group like CTW, which is worth millions, need taxpayer money to set up shop in Russia?  And what does giving exposure to the Russian-speaking equivalent of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch have to do with developing democracy and the rule of law? <p>


<a name="capitalism"><h3><center>SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA</h3></a></center>

	Properly focused and administered, aid to Russia and the NIS serves American interests. AID could help prevent Russia from becoming a crime-ridden "mafiacracy," a source of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons proliferation, and a destabilizing factor in the global financial and commodities markets. Many Russian democrats wish for the same things. <p>

	In order to assist the transformation to democratic capitalism in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The nuclear sale was the topic of discussions between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at their May summit in Moscow. The two agreed to refer the matter to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission for further negotiation. During those negotiations, Vice President Gore should make it clear that the U.S. and Russia cannot have a normal and friendly relationship if the sale goes through. <p>
</ul>
	In the meantime, Russia wants a sweeping rescheduling of half its $130 billion debt to the West by the end of this year. At the same time, Yeltsin asked the G-7 leaders at the Halifax summit in June to accept Russia into the Paris Club as a creditor to Third World countries for their Soviet-era debts. This is an opportunity for the U.S. Senate to demand Russia's cancellation of the Iranian nuclear deal. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could demand that Russia's debt not be rescheduled if the deal goes through. The U.S. could relax access to its nuclear and commercial satellite launch markets for Russian companies as compensation for canceling the Iranian transaction. <p>
<ul>
<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on cease-fire in Chechnya. The U.S. cannot and should not challenge the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. Like any other state, Russia has the right to ensure its sovereignty. However, this right does not justify the extreme means employed against the people of Chechnya. Other measures short of war should have been taken. For example, a Federal Treaty model, which is working in the case of Moscow's relations with Tatarstan, was not seriously tried in Chechnya.<p>
</ul>
	Last spring, the U.S. supported $6.6 billion in International Monetary Fund credits to Russia. In view of Moscow's intransigence in Chechnya, the Congress should condition any future U.S. support for IMF financial assistance on a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict. The U.S. should demand that all hostilities be stopped, especially those affecting innocent civilians, and that negotiations be successfully concluded, either bilaterally or through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until such time, the Senate should consider amending the foreign aid authorization bill to demand that the U.S. suspend its financial assistance to Russia through such multilateral organizations as the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. This position would strengthen the hand of Russians who are calling for an end to the hostilities in Chechnya and for a negotiated solution.<p>
<ul>
<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. AID has poorly managed U.S. aid programs for the NIS. An independent board, nominated jointly by Congress and the President, should take over the management of these programs and refocus them on building democratic capitalism in the NIS. (A modified board for all assistance projects was suggested by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), but was voted down in committee.) This board could include representatives from the State and Commerce Departments as well as area experts and representatives of the U.S. corporations involved in the NIS.<p></ul>

	There is precedent for creating such a board. The presidentially appointed Board of International Broadcasting (BIB) for forty years successfully administered Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Members of this nonpartisan board included such prominent Americans as Malcolm Forbes, Jr., James Buckley, Frank Shakespeare, and Lane Kirkland.<p>
<ul>
<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. Under the CIP, $90 million worth of U.S.-made oil and gas equipment is to be given to Russia's most profitable industry, the hydrocarbon energy sector. The program should be abolished. The CIP is supposed to improve the Russian balance of payments and to assist in repaying Russia's debt to Western creditors by allowing Russia, with U.S. support, to drill for and sell more oil in the world market. AID bureaucrats hope that more productive American equipment will boost the Russian state-run energy sector. However, all the CIP would do is prop up the inefficient state-owned Russian energy industry. Experience in Russia shows that Western equipment alone is not a panacea. Capital investment, such as CIP-funded equipment, will not alleviate the problems of systemic mismanagement that plague the Russian oil and gas industry. Only privatization and massive Western investment will resolve the problem once and for all. The funds saved from abolishing CIP should be reprogrammed into democracy-building programs.<p></ul>

	So, too, should funds from the program to build housing for Russian military officers. Under orders from President Yeltsin, the Russian army participated in the slaughter of civilians in Chechnya. The funding for Russian officer resettlement was cut by the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee this spring. The Senate restored this funding in conference, but reduced it from the $155 million requested by the Clinton Administration to $135 million. This money would be spent better on democracy-building programs. <p>
<ul>
<li>Make democratic development a top priority. Thus far, AID's Democratic Initiatives Program is unfocused and suffers from hidden agendas. For example, AID will spend $500,000 on a program administered by Winrock International to enhance the "development and operation of a united group of women's NGOs in Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. to facilitate interaction, cooperation and collaboration in the building of a democratic society in the former Soviet Union."  Russia needs to build democratic institutions and the rule of law. It does not need American liberals telling Russians how to organize feminist groups.<p></ul>

	Far more important would be programs that train Russians to run election campaigns and organize grass-roots groups and referenda. This aid should be given to such democratic parties as Russia's Choice, Yabloko, and the Economic Freedom Party. Public organizations involved in significant reform of legislative and judicial bodies or in public education, such as the Foundation for Parliamentary Development and the newly established Anti-Fascist Foundation, also deserve support.<p>

	U.S.-funded programs need to employ qualified Russian reformers, who understand their politics and culture far better than AID contractors with little experience in Russia. Most AID democracy development programs have been awarded to traditional contractors who know more about AID's lengthy and complex contracting process than they do about Russia, Ukraine, and other NIS countries. Russians and Americans living in Moscow complain that these contractors spend large amounts of AID money to "educate" themselves about the problems. Why hand out perks to friends of AID bureaucrats when Russian democrats could do the job for less money?<p>

	To focus aid programs on building democracy in the NIS, Congress should establish priorities for democratic assistance. Funds should go to Russian and American organizations that:<p>
<ul>
<li>Train Russians and other NIS citizens to run and manage elections and electoral campaigns;<p>

<li>Foster the use of public opinion research;<p>

<li>Help organize democratic grass-roots organizations;<p>

<li>Educate Russians in fundraising techniques;<p>

<li>Develop political parties;<p>

<li>Develop Western-style academic programs in law, business, and market economics;<p>

<li>Use the existing legal system to prosecute neo-Nazis for violations of laws;<p>

<li>Post Western legal advisors in the legislatures, government ministries, regional administrations, the court system, and the Attorney General's office;<p>

<li>Help develop administrative law that allows citizens to challenge central and local governments in the courts;<p>

<li>Work to develop constitutional law;<p>

<li>Draft democratic legislation;<p>

<li> Assist in law enforcement, such as setting up neighborhood watches, anti-crime hotlines, and witness relocation programs; and <p>

<li>Train legislators, judges, and lawyers in the rule of law.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could direct more funds into democracy-building programs administered by the Eurasia Foundation and National Endowment for Democracy. The Eurasia Foundation and NED directly fund Russian grass-roots organizations, like the Memorial Society, which is fighting against human rights violations in Chechnya, and the Glasnost Foundation, which promotes the reform of Russia's secret services. These are examples of organizations that deserve Western support. Private American institutions such as The Heritage Foundation, the Krieble Institute, and the Soros Foundation have accumulated experience in working with Russian institutions and could help identify appropriate recipients and personnel for targeted U.S. assistance.<p></ul>


<h3><a name="conclusion"><center>CONCLUSION</a></h3></center>

	Russian democracy is in a danger zone. While U.S. aid alone cannot save democracy in Russia, it certainly can improve its chance of surviving. Clearly, America has an interest in a democratic Russia. Assisting Russia's transition to democracy is as important as were the de-Nazification of Germany and the reforming of Japan after World War II. But the Clinton Administration has failed to rise to the challenge. Time is running out. U.S. aid programs need to be refocused not on the traditional development goals of the foreign aid bureaucracy, but on building democracy and free markets.<p>

AID'S DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS IN THE NIS

	The AID-funded Democratic Pluralism Initiatives Project includes the following programs:  Political Development, Rule of Law, Public Administration/Local Government, and Civil Society and Media. <p>

	The strategic aim of these programs is to accelerate NIS transition to democracy and a market economy. Their task is to strengthen civil society and its institutions, train market specialists and civic leaders, and encourage the transition to a more benign political culture. <p>

	Following is a brief summary of the major AID initiatives in the NIS. <p>

	Political Development Program. A large part of the AID funding in this program goes to the two U.S. party institutes. Since 1992 the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute have received over $10 million each. These institutes fund seminars and education for political party activists, conferences, and exchanges. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has received over $6 million. It is involved in training for and supervision of electoral processes. The AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute has received $3.5 million. Other organizations, from the New York-based Freedom House to Indiana University, have received grants that as a rule are less than $1 million.<p>

	The Rule of Law. These programs are executed by three contractors. The largest contract, worth over $18 million, is in the hands of ARD/Checchi and Company, a traditional AID contractor. Other awards amounting to $5.6 million have gone to the American Bar Association's Central and East European Law Initiative. The Central Asian component of the Rule of Law program, worth $5.5 million, was awarded to yet another traditional AID contractor, Chemonics. These contractors provide a variety of services, from commenting on legislative drafts to jury trial training and the education of judges and prosecutors.<p>

	Public Administration and Local Government. This program is administered by the Research Triangle Institute ($19.5 million), World Learning ($2.2 million), and several smaller contractors. The program focuses on bringing Russian and NIS local officials and professionals to the U.S. to learn the techniques of city management.<p>

	Civil Society and Media. This program funds such media projects as Internews, a Moscow-based independent TV news production operation.<p>

<p>
<h3>ABOUT ISSUES `96</h3>
</center><P>
<P><I>Issues `96</I> is intended as a handbook for conservative candidates 
of all parties seeking national office.
<P>
<P><I>Issues `96</I> is broken down into sections, one dealing with 
domestic issues likely to be part of the debate, and the other dealing 
with foreign policy and defense issues. Each section begins with a 
general introduction.
<P>
<P>Each chapter follows a general structure (with some variation 
in the foreign policy section). The chapter first summarizes the 
principal issues considered likely to be raised during the election. 
The main body of the chapter then provides candidate-friendly 
statistics and other information to help frame the debate. Following 
this is a summary of the record of the 104th Congress and the 
Clinton Administration on the issue, and a set of policy 
recommendations for 1997. Finally, chapters include a question-and-answer 
section dealing with questions likely to be raised during the debate. 
The information in each chapter is fully footnoted for reference, and 
a list of experts and relevant Heritage publications is included.
<P>
<P>The material in each chapter is as up-to-date as possible. 
<I>Issues `96</I> went into final production in mid-February; whenever 
possible, policy developments since that time have been noted. Updates 
will be issued if there are developments that affect key parts of a 
chapter. These updates can be obtained from The Heritage 
Foundation Government Relations Department or through the 
Heritage Internet home page.

<CENTER><H2>THE CHOICE IN 1996</H2>
<CITE>By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> </CITE></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he promised America  a different way
of doing business in Washington. He promised  an end to gridlock, saying that
now there would be a President  willing to work closely with Congress to deal
with the problems that  afflict the nation. He promised fiscal integrity in
Washington and  a reduction in taxes on overburdened working families. He 
promised to reinvent the federal government. And he promised to &quot;end 
welfare as we know it.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>He has done none of these things. Worse still, when a  Congress was elected
in 1994 prepared to send Clinton the  legislation needed to do the things he had
promised, he did not cooperate  with Capitol Hill to fashion a reasonable
compromise. Instead,  he worked actively against passage of the legislation and
then  vetoed most of the key bills he was sent. The result: the very gridlock 
he promised to end. The main reason for this impasse is that  while Congress
generally has been prepared to face up to the tough  decisions that must be made
to balance the budget, reform  entitlements, and restructure failing programs,
Bill Clinton has failed  to confront the constituencies that oppose change.
Moreover, he  has failed to exercise leadership by using his presidency to 
force Americans to recognize that hard decisions have to be made.  As veteran
journalist Robert Samuelson put it early in 1996:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     President Clinton no longer has a coherent agenda, if he 
ever did. Mainly, he favors everything that might make people  feel good and
opposes anything that might make them feel  bad. He (reluctantly) supports a
balanced budget while  denouncing congressional cuts in popular programs like
Medicare,  Medicaid and food stamps. Clinton exploits these issues  without
illuminating the practical choices government  faces. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftntintr.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Much like the citizens of many other Western  democracies, Americans have a
habit of trying to avoid major decisions  about the scope and finances of their
government until they cannot  escape such choices. The actions required then
typically are far  more extreme than would have been needed had prudent steps
had  been taken earlier. America today faces a number of issues on  which
well-conceived and decisive action now will avoid  panic-driven and drastic
action some years in the future. Correcting the  structural financial imbalance
in the Medicare program now, for  instance, can avoid collapse early in the next
decade. Action now,  in other words, will forestall the severe cutbacks or huge
tax  increases that will be needed to provide health coverage for  today's baby
boomers when they retire. Similarly, unless Congress and  the states tackle the
spiraling growth in illegitimacy within the  context of true welfare reform,
America is headed for a social  catastrophe. And taking steps now to reform
America's inefficient and  costly tax system will give the American economy the
incentive it  needs to boost entrepreneurship, productivity, and wages so that 
Americans are not scrambling in the next century to catch up with  other
nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Congress was prepared to tackle these and similar  issues of
enormous consequence to the future of the country. But  time 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  and again, the new leadership was
thwarted, and  fundamental choices over policy were grossly caricatured by
opponents as  being &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot; children, or the
elderly, or even  allowing visits to the Grand Canyon. The 1996 election is
likely to be  the only opportunity for some years to force a real national 
discussion over the historic challenges facing the nation, and so to resolve 
the impasse in Washington. Conservative candidates must seize  the opportunity
to debate the real choices for dealing with these  challenges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are several particularly important domestic issues for  conservatives
to frame in the 1996 election. Among them:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><UL>
<li>     <B>Washington must balance its budget through real reductions
 in spending and reforms in the way government functions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Politicians in Washington promise to balance the budget  with about the same
eagerness as they pause to shake hands or kiss  babies. But only rarely are they
willing to take the serious  action needed to eliminate red ink. Congresses in
the past invariably  have passed budgets that use creative accounting to reach
balance  well into the future, but then have failed to make the changes in 
programs needed to achieve balance. On many such occasions,  Congresses have
combined phony spending controls with real  increases in taxes. But rather than
reach balance, the new tax  revenue merely reduced the political enthusiasm in
Washington  for making tough decisions on spending. This is why huge tax 
increases enacted under George Bush and Bill Clinton have  done virtually
nothing to bring the deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 sought to break this pattern by  proposing a budget that would reach
balance within seven years  while repealing about one-third of the Bush-Clinton
tax increases.  Unlike most Washington budgets, this one focused much more on 
real changes in programs, much less on gimmicks. Thus, the  budget legislation
passed by Congress in 1995 included structural  changes in Medicare, Medicaid,
and welfare, as well as the termination  of programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed that legislation. Before and after that  budget
reached his desk, Clinton spent month after month  finding ways to avoid
offering a budget that would achieve the fiscal  responsibility he promised
during his election campaign.  Clinton's first set of budgets simply did not
even balance, and put off  policy decisions to achieve even modest spending
controls until into  the next century. As 1995 ended, the President seemed
content to  have no budget rather upset any constituency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the 1996 election, conservatives must make the case that  the budget must
be balanced and that it can be balanced only by  reducing the growth in
spending, not by raising taxes.  Conservatives also must make the argument that
the way to reduce the growth  of spending is not to squeeze good and bad
programs alike, but  by such actions as making tough changes in entitlements and
 terminating obsolete and inefficient programs and departments,  shifting
functions to the private sector that should not be in the public  sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>There must be structural changes in Medicare if the
program is  to exist for the next generation of retirees.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most noticeable, and disturbing, trends in  federal 
spending in recent decades has
been the shift to entitlement  spending. According to the 1994 report of the
Bipartisan Commission  on Entitlement and Tax Reform, entitlement spending has 
consumed an increasing share of total federal spending, rising from 22.7 
percent of all spending in FY 1963 to over 47 percent in FY  1993. This means
that almost half of all federal spending is on  &quot;autopilot,&quot; driven by
statutory rights to certain services rather than  by budgets voted on each year.
Worse still, the largest  entitlements, including Medicare and Social Security,
are hopelessly out of  balance over the long haul. In particular, spending on
Medicare  is rising at such a clip that the program simply will have no money 
to pay any hospital benefits within six years. Already it is so out  of balance
that it is adding tens of billions of dollars each year to  the general budget
deficit, and this drain on the budget is projected  to rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 was the first since the major  entitlements
were created to address the runaway growth of  entitlements and to restructure
the programs to achieve better value for  money. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995
contained historic reforms  of several entitlements. It ended the entitlement to
welfare  and shifted the design and operation of welfare to the states. It 
ended the entitlement to Medicaid, again moving control of the  program to the
states. And it restructured the Medicare program, curbing  its rate of growth
and increasing competition and consumer choice  to improve efficiency and
achieve savings.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clinton vetoed that legislation. According to the White House,  no decisive
action was necessary, and taking serious action  would hurt people. On Medicare,
the White House response was  merely to predict that Medicare growth would slow
down and to  offer tighter price controls on doctors and hospitals -- and to  denounce Congress's efforts as draconian and
anti-elderly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the election, conservative candidates need to point out that  most of
today's working-age voters will find literally nothing  in Medicare's hospital
trust fund with which to pay their  medical bills when they retire. So there is
a clear choice open to voters,  and candidates must press the public to make it:
Either voters can  send the message to Washington that they want to avoid doing 
anything, and let benefits be cut deeply and taxes raised sharply  sometime in
the future, or they can tell Washington they want  prudent steps taken now to
restore the finances of the system.  Candidates also must persuade voters to
face the fact that other  middle-class entitlements cannot be allowed to grow
unchecked if the  programs are to pay promised benefits to America's children
when  they reach retirement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>There must be an end to welfare as we know it and a
national  strategy to reduce illegitimacy.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America has spent over $5 trillion in today's dollars fighting the War on Poverty -- more than on defeating Germany and Japan  in World War II. But as every
taxpayer and welfare mother  knows, the War on Poverty has been a ghastly
failure. Not only has  the poverty rate, for many years, shown no sign of
falling  significantly, but -- even more ominous -- the rate of illegitimacy  has
risen remorselessly. In the black community, two out of  every three children
today are born out of wedlock, and for the  general population one-third of
babies are born to mothers with no  husband. Studies show clearly that being
brought up in a  female-headed household is potentially very damaging to a
child.  Even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  liberals no longer dispute the
findings. Such things as high  levels of teenage crime, poor school performance,
and low future  earnings can be traced to the lack of a father in the home.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress agreed with President Clinton that welfare  as we know it
had to be ended and that urgent action was needed  to curb the dramatic rise in
illegitimacy. So Congress passed  legislation that would have begun the
transformation of welfare,  ending the entitlement nature of many federal
benefits, allowing the  states to make major changes in the design of programs,
and laying  down modest goals on work and illegitimacy for the states to 
achieve. But rather than sign the legislation, Clinton first criticized and 
then denounced it. His own proposal: limited authority to states,  a larger
welfare bureaucracy to &quot;help&quot; people to leave welfare  rather than
strong incentives to do so, and no real action to back up  the talk about
stemming the tide of illegitimacy. Virtually any effort  to discourage
illegitimate births was attacked by Clinton as  tantamount to child abuse.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The utter failure of the liberal welfare state, including the  explosion of
illegitimacy, is shredding America's social fabric. In  the 1996 election,
conservative candidates must urge Americans  to make a clear choice. They can
accept the arguments of those  who say that the only problem with the welfare
state today is that we  do not spend enough on it. According to this line of
argument,  what Congress should do is commit huge amounts of additional 
resources to child care, training programs, and other services to  enable
welfare mothers to become employable. This argument  is advanced most
vociferously by those who would be paid to  deliver the services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other option, conservatives should point out, is to move in  the
direction that Congress charted but Clinton vetoed. This  means facing up to the
obvious fact that spending more money on  welfare harms children rather than
helping them and destroys  families rather than strengthening them. The
conservative option is to  concentrate on reducing the rate of illegitimacy  the
root cause  of America's social problems  by discouraging  out-of-wedlock births
and reducing the burdens on two-parent families. In  addition, the conservative
option would give wide authority to states  to redesign programs while insisting
on clear national goals to  reduce illegitimacy and require work, and would
implement real  evaluations of state efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Further, conservatives must make the case that if poor  Americans are to be
held responsible for their actions, as other Americans  are held accountable,
they also must be given the power to take  responsibility. That means giving
poor Americans the same right  to choose the school that is right for their
child, through vouchers,  as the President of the United States enjoys. And it
means  enabling these Americans, through housing vouchers and the right to 
manage or own their own homes, to escape the crushing and  dangerous environment
of many public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>It's time to reduce the tax burden on families with
children and  to introduce a flat tax.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans have grown increasingly frustrated with the tax  code. Quite
correctly, they see it as complex and unfair, full of  loopholes for those with
the means or sophistication to exploit them. That  is why a simple, flat tax is
so attractive to so many voters. But  besides its mind-numbing complexity,
today's tax code has two  other 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  severe deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One is that over the years the burden has shifted decisively  to families
with children. Because of the erosion, through  inflation, of exemptions and the
rise in Social Security tax rates,  families with children have faced an
increasing share of taxes when  compared with other groups. This has accentuated
the perverse  incentives of the welfare system and made it harder for 
middle-class families with children to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other deficiency is the treatment of savings and  investment. The tax
code almost seems designed to discourage investment  and risk-taking by
subjecting saved income to multiple taxation.  The result: Saving has been
discouraged, and those who have  saved find the nest egg they accumulated for
themselves and their  children eaten away by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 tried to take the first steps to  correct these
problems. Concentrating on the most immediate problem -- the bias against
families with children  Congress enacted  legislation that would have given a
$500 credit per child to families  with children. This across-the-board credit
recognized that the  purpose of the original exemption for children was to
relieve all families  of taxation on income used to raise children. Congress
also  included in the legislation a reduction in the capital gains tax and the 
reduction of taxes on certain new forms of savings. Unfortunately,  despite
pledging a middle-class tax cut in 1992 and raising  taxes since then, President
Clinton vetoed the legislation, invoking  traditional class warfare arguments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives need to use the 1996 election to frame the issue  of 
taxation. They need to argue that
the time for tinkering with  the tax code is over: What is needed is a new tax
system that is  simple and flat, taxes earnings only once, and redresses the
unfair tax  burden on families with children. Such a flat tax not only would 
bring back fairness and help ordinary working families, but it would  end the
tax penalties currently ranged against those Americans  who invest in the future
of their own children and that of the nation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>The American economy is the world's most powerful engine 
of jobs and wealth creation. Washington should stop slowing  down that engine.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While it is natural for people to be concerned about their  economic future,
conservative candidates must not allow these concerns  to be channeled into bad
policies based on a phony reading of  history. This means that candidates must
remind voters of the  real nature and strength of the U.S. economy. And they
must  remind voters, too, that government can do little to improve on the 
workings of the free enterprise system, but much to damage it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many politicians play to fears of economic insecurity and  suggest that
ordinary working Americans are somehow the victims of  Wall Street greed or
underpriced foreign competition. Some of  these politicians go on to argue,
surprisingly, that Americans should  turn to the federal government to assure
their security and  economic well-being. Yet the facts refute the premise behind
this line of  argument, and hard-learned experience indicates that a more 
active federal government is no answer to insecurity. In particular, 
conservatives need to remind Americans that constant change is  the key to
America's traditional economic strength. That is  why America has created 46
million jobs since 1970, while Europe  has 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  languished. And conservatives
must remind Americans that  the tough competition of international trade
sharpens efficiency  and brings prosperity to all Americans, while defeatist 
protectionism leads to long-run stagnation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the U.S. economy still has performed less well  than it could
for many years, and so has rewarded American  workers less well than it could.
There are three main reasons for this.  The first is that government has
increased the cost of hiring  Americans, through regulation and taxation, and
has taken more and more  out of each paycheck. This has meant fewer jobs than
otherwise  would have been created, especially for lower-skilled Americans. 
Over the last 20 years, for instance, regulation alone has probably  cost more
than three million jobs. The solution is deregulation and  reduced taxes on
labor  less government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second reason is that the shortcomings of the public  school system have
caused many Americans to lack the basic skills  they need to be productive, and
thus command good wages. This  government failure in basic education is not
corrected by  maintaining a public school monopoly, or by creating government
training  programs to try to correct the deficiencies of government schools. It 
is addressed by giving parents the power to demand better value  for money,
establishing real standards to enable parents to  evaluate schools, and ending
the public school monopoly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The third reason is that the tax code's bias against saving and  investment
has slowed down the introduction of the new tools  and equipment in the economy
that workers need to be more  productive and earn higher wages. The solution to
this problem is to  reduce taxes on capital.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This Congress has attempted to reduce these government  sources of long-term
drag on the U.S. economy. It has sought to  reduce capital gains taxes and taxes
on working Americans. It has tried  to eliminate regulations whose meager
benefits do not justify  the heavy cost in jobs. And it has encouraged states to
take the lead,  as they should, in overhauling the education system. 
Unfortunately, President Clinton has obstructed or vetoed all of these  efforts.
Meanwhile, he has fostered the enticing but false notion that  government can
provide an economic security blanket for all  Americans. To his credit, however,
Clinton has worked with the  new congressional leadership to resist
protectionism and reduce  worldwide barriers to trade.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives need to draw sharp lines in the debate over  the economy
during the election cycle. They must point out that  there are those who would
maintain  even increase  the current  burden on taxation and regulation on the
economy, and then seek  to expand government programs and protections to &quot;correct&quot;
the  apparent shortcomings of the economy. But this is the road to  stagnation,
not jobs and wealth. They must argue instead that the  only way to create jobs,
prosperity, and long-term security is to end  tax and regulatory policies that
hamper job creation and wage growth.
</UL>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other issues also must be raised in the 1996 election.  Americans need to be
presented with the clear choices that exist on such  issues as health care, the
environment, crime, education, and  congressional reform. In all these policy
areas, critical choices have  to be made  indeed, should have been made many
years ago.  Since the last election, the country has had a Congress willing to 
confront the choices and to take action, and a White House trying  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  persuade the nation to cling to
the cozy illusion that no  hard choices need to be made. It is up to
conservatives during this  election season to make sure that Americans
understand this, and  that they are presented with the clear decisions that no
longer can  be avoided.

<P><B><A NAME="THE">The Issues</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of balancing the federal budget is no longer in question  in
Washington. Both Congress and (much more reluctantly)  President Clinton have
presented plans to balance the budget by FY  2002 that are certified by the
Congressional Budget Office. As with  any major corporation facing Chapter 11
bankruptcy, however,  balancing the books on paper is not the same as taking the
tough  actions needed to restore a failing institution to fiscal health. Even if
 Congress and the President reach a balanced budget agreement  in 1996, which is
by no means certain, the federal budget still  will fund hundreds of programs
that are obsolete, inefficient, or ripe  for privatization, or which should be
turned back to state and  local governments. Thus, the central budget issue for
the 1996  election should be how to restructure the government to meet the 
nation's needs in the 21st century. Such a debate will lay the  groundwork for
swift action by the 105th Congress in 1997 to downsize  and restructure the
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress and the President are serious about restructuring  the federal
government, they must challenge the substance of  every government program  top
to bottom  using three principles  to guide their work: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Federalism:</B> This means determining which activities are  the
responsibility of the federal government and which are best  done by state and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Privatization: </B>This means finding ways to transfer many 
activities now run  inefficiently or inappropriately  by government  to the more
effective and efficient private sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Termination:</B> This means asking of every government  program:
Should the government be engaged in this activity at all?  Is  this program
outmoded, obsolete, inefficient, or broken beyond repair?   If the answer to any
of these questions is yes, then Washington  has an obligation to the taxpayers
to terminate the program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Tinkering with the process of government will not cut  enough spending to
balance the budget; nor will it deliver the major  restructuring the government
needs. Making obsolete programs  process paperwork more efficiently is a waste
of taxpayers'  money. This is the major failing of Vice President Al Gore's
National  Performance Review, or &quot;Reinventing Government&quot; initiative. 
Taxpayers sent a clear message to Washington in 1994 that they do  not want
useless and obsolete programs to waste their money  more efficiently. They want
the budget to be balanced in a timely  fashion, and they want the result of this
effort to be a smaller,  less costly government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration managed to cast  the 1995 budget
debate more as a struggle over the process of how  to balance the federal budget
on paper, without making any hard  decisions, than as a serious attempt to
define what the  government should look like once the budget is put in balance,
and what  was 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  needed to reach that result. The
Balanced Budget Act of  1995, which passed Congress only to be vetoed by
President Clinton,  did contain many substantive policy changes to slow federal 
spending growth and turn some federal programs back to the states. But  in an
effort to force the President to compromise, even this did  too little to alter
the basic structure of government.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Lawmakers thus face many important challenges in the 1996  election period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> they must make the case for continuing to cut spending  
especially discretionary spending if a budget deal  significantly reforms
entitlement programs  to keep the budget on target  for balance in FY 2002; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> they must engage in a serious debate about what the  federal
government should look like once the budget is in balance  and how it should be
restructured to meet the needs of the next  generation of Americans; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> they must change the underlying structure of  entitlement
programs to prevent these programs from consuming ever  more tax dollars and
ever greater shares of the federal budget; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> they must reform the budget process itself to reign  in
spending and bring accountability to how tax dollars are  spent. The current
budget process is a disaster and badly needs  reform.<B> </B>The President is
often a mere bystander, unable to exercise  much control of the nation's purse
strings except through the veto  once Congress has passed a budget. On the other
hand, spending  authority within Congress is highly diffuse across many
committees.  As 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  a result, most Members of Congress
are on one or more  committees with the authority to spend money, but no one
Member is  responsible for how the money is spent. In order to rein in the 
government spending machine, conservatives must make the case  for reforming the
budget process.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Balancing the federal budget is not a panacea for what ails the  federal
government or the national economy. It is simply one step  in returning fiscal
health to a decrepit institution and one element  in boosting economic growth.
To transform the federal  government from a relic of the past into a modern
institution, much more  needs to be done to slow the growth of federal spending,
especially  the uncontrollable portions of the budget known as entitlements,  or
mandatory spending. Also, the budget must be stripped of  programs that have
become outmoded, obsolete, broken beyond  repair, candidates for privatization,
or transfer to state or local  authority. And the process of crafting the budget
itself, which  now takes over a year from the time the White House begins its
work  to the time Congress puts the finishing touches on it, must be fixed  or
the first two priorities cannot be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, balancing the budget and cutting taxes, as the  Balanced Budget
Act of 1995 (BBA) proposed to do, are not  competing ends. Cutting taxes is
central to boosting long-term  economic growth as spending is curbed to bring
the budget into balance.  To be sure, balancing the budget without tax cuts, as
some in  Congress have proposed, will produce higher economic growth  over the
long term than not balancing the budget would. But more  robust economic growth
is generated by a balanced budget plan  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  includes tax cuts. Key to this
superior growth potential are tax  cuts to stimulate new investment and tax cuts
for families.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending Is the Problem</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration proudly claims that the 1993  Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (OBRA 1993), which instituted  the largest tax increase in
U.S. history, produced three years of  continuous decline in the federal deficit
for the first time since  the 1950s. While the causal relationship between the
Clinton tax  increase and slightly falling deficits is questionable, one fact is
 certain: Tax increases do not lead to long-term deficit reduction.  As the
budget deals of 1982, 1984, 1987, and 1990 showed  clearly, tax increases lead
to higher federal spending, slower than  expected economic growth, and, not
surprisingly, higher deficits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures show  that while the
deficit did decline from $255 billion in FY 1993 to  $161 billion in FY 1995, it
is now estimated that it will soar to  nearly $300 billion in ten years, or 83
percent higher than today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Deficits are a symptom of a disease, and the disease is  spending. Thus, the
1995 budget debate was unlike every other effort  to eliminate the federal
deficit because it focused solely on  how much to slow the growth of spending.
There was no discussion  at all, even from liberals, of the &quot;need&quot; for
additional tax revenues  to close the deficit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent CBO spending projections reveal how daunting the task  of controlling
spending really is. From FY 1995 to FY 2002, if  no changes are made in current
law, federal spending will balloon  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  $582 billion, a 38 percent rise.
On average, CBO projects that  total federal spending will grow by 4.8 percent
per year through  2002. While discretionary, or appropriated, programs are
projected  to grow by some 14 percent over the next seven years, and net 
interest payments on the national debt by 16 percent, the reason for  the
explosion in federal spending is entitlement, or mandatory,  spending.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Need to Control Entitlements</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the short-term projections of entitlement growth should  demand
lawmakers' attention, the long-term growth  projections should demand every
taxpayer's attention. If left  uncontrolled, entitlements will consume a greater
share of budgetary  resources, leaving less money for defense, education,
housing, national  parks, and other areas. But these areas also will continue to
consume  a larger share of the nation's resources. The result will be  stifled
economic growth, higher taxes on tomorrow's workers, and  reduced living
standards for every American.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the impact of growing entitlements extends well  beyond the federal
budget. Unrestricted entitlements distort  individual behavior in many ways  for
example, by discouraging  self-help or even encouraging some beneficiaries to
choose leisure  over work. And growing entitlements distort political behavior
as  more and more Americans become members of an &quot;entitled class.&quot;  
Until recently, politicians have been more than willing to accept  deficit
spending to avoid making politically painful choices on  tax increases or
benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What are entitlements?</B> According to the Congressional  Research 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  Service (CRS), &quot;entitlements
are created by legislation that  requires the payment of benefits to any person
or unit of  government that meets the eligibility requirements established by
such  law.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>
 Entitlements are part of a larger category of the budget called  mandatory
spending. Mandatory spending generally is any  spending that is not controlled
through the appropriations process,  including interest payments on the national
debt and deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How many entitlement programs are there?</B> While there  are &quot;about
400 entitlement and mandatory spending accounts,&quot; it  is difficult to
answer this question because there is &quot;no clear  definition of what
constitutes a `program'.&quot;<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     According to the CRS, &quot;the 19
programs with estimated FY  1993 outlays of $2 billion or more account for 97
percent of  entitlement spending. The large social welfare entitlement programs 
dominate mandatory spending  18 of the 19 largest programs are in  the social
welfare budget functions.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     According to the 1994 report of the
Bipartisan Commission  on Entitlement and Tax Reform, headed by Senators Robert 
Kerry (D-NE) and John Danforth (R-MO, now retired), since the  early 1960s,
entitlement spending has consumed an increasing share  of total federal
spending, rising from 22.7 percent of all spending  in FY 1963 to over 47
percent in FY 1993. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In the short term, CBO projects
that if nothing is done to slow  the growth of entitlement programs, they will
grow in aggregate  by $465 billion over the next seven years, a 63 percent 
increase. Worse yet, CBO expects entitlements to consume 57 cents of  every
dollar spent by the federal government in 2002  over 8  cents 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  more than is spent today.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The long-term forecasts reported by the Kerry-Danforth  Commission are even
more troubling. These projections suggest that  entitlements will become a
liability that cannot be sustained by  the federal government, by the economy,
or by taxpayers.

<P><B>*     Entitlement programs defy good budgeting practices.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principles of sound budgeting and fiscal responsibility  require that
spending decisions be based on available resources. The  way current entitlement
programs are designed, with their  open-ended claim on the economy's resources,
violates this principle.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Sound budget measures would require that the eligibility criteria  of these
programs be driven by priorities and limits set by  Congress in the budget. But
today, the federal budget is being driven by  the eligibility criteria of
federal entitlements. The entitlement tail  wags the budget dog. The automatic
growth of these programs  forces higher taxes on American workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Deficit reduction should not be the primary goal of  entitlement reform. It
should be the result. These programs should be  reformed because there needs to
be a real decision about their scale,  their objectives, and how best to achieve
their goals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Simple &quot;fixes&quot; are not the way to reform entitlements.  Sweeping
cuts without reforms, for instance, are akin to using wage  and price controls
to curb inflation. As history shows, price  controls and spending caps produce
the budgetary effects of clamping a  lid on a boiling pot. Nor is means-testing
itself a sound way to  curb the growth of mandatory programs, especially if tax
increases  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  used as the primary tool for &quot;taking
benefits&quot; away from  upper-income recipients. Means-testing does nothing to
change the  fundamental problems with the program. The result is a broken 
program with fewer beneficiaries. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Current entitlement programs also should be authorized  and funded on at
least a biannual basis. If necessary, a  commission should be created to balance
program eligibility and available  budgetary resources. Congress would vote on
such  recommendations at the beginning of every two-year cycle. Further, the 
government should have a mechanism for monitoring who is receiving  federal
assistance from all sources. For able-bodied individuals,  there should be a
lifetime limit on government assistance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Entitlement programs violate the American principle of 
federalism.</B>
</P>
<P>

<P>The principle of federalism suggests that programs should  be funded and
managed by the most effective level of  government. Many federal entitlement
programs, such as Medicaid and  welfare, have become expensive mandates to state
and local  governments. The long-term result of such mandates is an irrational
balance  of funding for programs that distort state government  decision-making.
Moreover, since states depend on federal dollars, they  have less incentive to
manage programs in the most efficient and  cost-effective manner.

<P>Entitlement programs undermine individual behavior in  various ways. While
the disastrous incentive effects of welfare on the  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  havior of the poor are well
known, entitlement programs also  encourage the middle class to change their
behavior in ways that  are neither fiscally healthy nor socially desirable. The
fastest  growing portion of the Medicaid program, for example, is made up of 
the long-term costs of nursing care for the elderly &quot;poor.&quot;   However,
many middle-class seniors are simply divesting themselves of  their assets and
technically impoverishing themselves to become  eligible for Medicaid's generous
nursing home payments. Such  a scam may work to the benefit of a senior's
children   absolving children of the cost of caring for their parents  but
society  is much worse off as a result.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government has become a monument to the needs  and priorities of
the 19th century, the Great Depression, World War  II, and the Great Society. No
amount of &quot;reinventing,&quot; as Vice  Presi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  dent Al Gore's National
Performance Review proposes, can  turn institutions created to address problems
the nation faced 30, 50,  or even 100 years ago into agencies capable of meeting
the needs  of Americans in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most taxpayers would be stunned to learn how old many  federal programs and
agencies really are. Large segments of the  federal bureaucracy were created
decades ago for purposes long since  forgotten. It is time, for instance, to
strip out of the budget such  pre-World War II programs as the Rural
Electrification  Administration, the National Helium Reserves, Impact Aid, and
the  Agricultural Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many relatively new programs also have seen their missions  made obsolete by
technological and social changes. The Corporation  for Public Broadcasting,
international broadcasting programs such  as the Voice of America, Low-Income
Home Energy Assistance,  and the Department of Energy, for example, all are
outmoded or  irrelevant because of technological and market changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs almost  never die,
bureaus, agencies, and programs that duplicate each  other's functions have
sprung up all over the government. The  National Performance Review identified a
staggering degree of  duplication throughout the federal bureaucracy. For

<P><B>Why Tax Cuts Are Needed While Balancing the Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Washington insiders, especially those within the White House  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  some in Congress, argued
throughout 1995 that cutting taxes  was inconsistent with balancing the budget.
They claimed, for  instance, that tax cuts were not justified because Washington
could not  afford them while so much spending was being cut to balance  the
budget. Once the budget was in balance, they reasoned,  Americans could expect a
tax cut. This peculiar logic often gave taxpayers  the false impression that if
the tax cut package were dropped  from Congress's budget plan, Washington could
balance the  budget even sooner, say in five or six years rather than seven.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Such arguments are misleading at best and disingenuous at  worst. The
reasons:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> the $245 billion tax cut package contained in the BBA  is
small; it amounts only to returning to taxpayers 2 cents of  every dollar that
would otherwise be collected by the federal  government over the next seven
years. This is hardly &quot;unaffordable,&quot;  considering that federal tax
collections are projected to total nearly  $11.5 trillion over the next seven
years. Moreover, the tax cut  package amounts to returning only one-third of the
tax increase  imposed during the Bush and Clinton presidencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> if every dollar of tax cuts was eliminated from  Congress's
balanced budget plan, the budget would not balance any  sooner. Eliminating the
tax cut package, or reducing its size, would  only leave more money in the hands
of politicians and bureaucrats  to spend on programs taxpayers cannot afford and
do not even want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But one of the most important reasons for cutting taxes while  moving the
budget toward balance is that tax cuts significantly  increase potential
economic growth and allow millions of families and  in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  vestors to keep more of the money
they earn.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, last year economists at The Heritage  Foundation used one of
the principal econometric models of the U.S.  economy to project the economic
effects of the tax cut elements of the  congressional Balanced Budget Act. This
model (created by  Lawrence Meyer and Associates) is used by the Office of
Management  and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Federal 
Reserve Board. The analysis showed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The Balanced Budget Act with tax
cuts would have added  $112 billion more to gross domestic product (GDP) over
seven  years than the same plan without tax cuts.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The reduction in taxes on capital
(including capital gains tax  relief) accounts for $66 billion of this
additional GDP and leads to  a stronger economy in the long run.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why is there such a large increase in economic activity when  tax cuts are
included in a balanced budget?  Initially, balancing  the budget requires the
government to reduce its role in the  economy. In the short term, this can slow
the economy, but returning  money to the private sector by means of the
$500-per-child tax credit  will help to offset these negative effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, tax cuts to spur investments (particularly cuts in  the capital
gains tax rate) increase economic growth in the long  run. Cutting taxes on
investments has two beneficial effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> reducing the tax on capital gains lowers the cost of  moving
an investment from an average company to one that is  exception
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  ally productive and well run.
This lowering of &quot;switching&quot;  costs means that investors will play a
larger role in promoting well  run, productive companies. Thus, the economy as a
whole is likely  to be more efficient. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> lower taxes on capital cause the cost of capital to  fall.
Lenders, for example, do not require quite as much interest  on their capital
loans in order to recoup the taxes they paid when  they made the capital
available to a borrower. Lower capital costs  usually mean more investment by
businesses in labor-saving  equipment, which commonly results in increased labor
 productivity. This increased productivity translates into higher wages  and,
through the wonders of the division of labor, more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Need for Budget Process Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While there are many reasons why federal spending is out of  control, and
why the political process seems helpless to stop it,  the process of making a
budget is a significant factor. The  modern explosion in federal spending began
shortly after the 1974  Budget Act was passed in the &quot;wake of the Watergate
scandal, when  regard for the institution of the presidency had reached its 
lowest ebb.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#18">18</A></B></TT>
 The 1974 Act stripped the President of his authority  to impound funds  that
is, to refuse to spend excessive  program funding appropriated by Congress  and
directed greater  spending authority to Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, spending authority within Congress is highly  diffuse: Many
committees have the power to spend taxpayers' money,  but no one committee or
member is accountable for how it is  spent. Thus, the budget process is biased
toward increasing  spending, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  rather than toward setting
priorities. The key to bringing  accountability to the budget process is
therefore to shift greater  authority back to the President through such
measures as the line-item  veto and the Balanced Budget Amendment and to tighten
the rules  under which Congress goes about crafting the budget and  spending
money.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to popular belief, the federal budget is not a single  document.
Even the President's proposed budget, transmitted to  Congress each year,
usually incorporates four or five separate  volumes totaling thousands of pages.
The House and Senate must digest  the proposal and then generate their own
documents  at least  15 separate pieces of legislation  that outline their
proposal.  This ponderous process repeats itself each year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The annual workload for Congress and the President includes  the initial
proposals from each side (the President's budget  submission and the
Congressional Budget Resolution), the 13  appropriations bills, and, when
necessary, a reconciliation bill to deal  with changes in tax and entitlement
policy. Often, &quot;emergency&quot;  or &quot;supplemental&quot; appropriations
bills are added mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 13 (or more) appropriations bills cover only 37 percent of  federal
spending. Remaining &quot;mandatory&quot; or entitlement spending  is addressed,
if at all, in a single reconciliation bill. This messy  process must be married
with &quot;authorizing&quot; legislation that may  determine how a program
spends money over two years, five years,  or indefinitely. The numerous steps in
the budget process make  it difficult to cut spending. Real spending cuts can be
derailed at  any of several steps.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When considering the federal budget process, it is often best  to examine it
thematically. The key steps in the current process are:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Vision:</B> formulating a framework for the budget through 
the President's submitted budget and the congressional budget  resolution;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Authorization:</B> approving program details and maximum 
spending levels;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Appropriation:</B> approving specific amounts of
discretionary  spending; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Reconciliation:</B> changing permanent tax and entitlement
law  to meet the requirements of the budget resolution.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress vs. President</B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Congress and the President act independently in  the most
important step in the whole process: establishing their  own vision and
framework for the budget details. The President  submits his budget proposal to
Congress at the start of each year to  establish his vision. Following the
President's submission in early  February, Congress outlines its vision by March
of each year  through what is known as the budget resolution. This sets 
Congress's spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At this stage in the process, neither branch's proposal needs  be approved
by the other branch. In most recent years, as was the  case in 1995, the visions
of the President and Congress differed  significantly. Under the existing
process, however, negotiations  between 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  the two branches do not occur
until the end of the process   typically just before (or even after) the new
budget year begins   when a serious impasse often occurs. This happened late in 
1995 for the FY 1996 budget. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The budget resolution is not signed by the President, so does  not have the
force of law. Congress then proceeds with the  authorization and appropriations
process. It is not until a reconciliation  bill is adopted by the House and
Senate, usually in the fall, that  the two branches even begin<U> </U>to
discuss their policy differences.  This often leads to a &quot;train wreck,&quot;
as was the case in 1995, in  which parts of the government shut down or operate
under stopgap  funding while Congress and the President try to work out their 
differences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Authorizers vs. Appropriators </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It would be incorrect to assume that the only disputes in the  budget
process are those between the executive and legislative  branches. In fact, a
significant logjam can occur because of policy  differences among the budget
committee, authorizing committees,  and appropriations committees. The budget
committee drafts a  blueprint based on certain policy assumptions. Authorizing 
committees then are required to craft legislation setting out the 
responsibilities and maximum funding levels for a program with that  framework.
It is then the responsibility of the appropriating committees to  decide how
much to spend.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This three-tiered process means that the people who decide  how much to
spend cannot decide how that money should be  spent. Similarly, the politicians
who set the policies for the program  have 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  no meaningful control over its
funding. With policy decisions  divorced from spending decisions in Congress,
the likelihood  of ever-higher spending is increased. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, the effort to eliminate the Commerce Department  in 1995
required action by 11 committees and 9 subcommittees,  including the House and
Senate Appropriations Committees,  the House and Senate Commerce Committees, and
the House  Government Reform and Oversight and Senate Governmental  Affairs
Committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With a strong consensus among all these parties needed to  end government
programs, there is a clear bias against cutting  spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Entitlements vs. Nobody</B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While discretionary spending programs are subject to  multiple hurdles each
year, entitlements  which are mandatory  spending programs  operate on complete
auto-pilot. If Congress and  the President never passed another budget bill,
entitlement spending   which includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and 
welfare  would continue unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Two-thirds of the federal budget is consumed by mandatory  spending that
need not be approved annually by Congress or the  President. Leaving
entitlements without annual approval has  contributed to the dramatic increase
in mandatory spending as a  percentage of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The portion of the budget consumed by mandatory spending  has 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  doubled since 1968. Mandatory
federal spending also represents  a significant force in the American economy.
More than one-tenth  of the nation's economy (10.7 percent of gross domestic
product)  is consumed by mandatory programs.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Entitlements can be addressed in the budget process, but  when they are, it
is done in a single bill called a reconciliation  bill, which often incorporates
permanent changes in tax law,  pitting entitlement reforms against tax policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite the major fiscal impact of entitlement spending, there is  no
established process for Congress and the President to review  these expenditures
regularly. The Congress spends more than half  the year focusing on how to spend
one-third of the federal  budget, with far less attention paid to the other
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Previous Reforms.</B> Budget crises in 1986, 1988, and 1990  were met by
specific spending agreements coupled with budget  process reforms. Because
reforms left the flawed budget process  largely intact, however, the agreements
held only for a couple of years,  to be followed by new crises when economic or
political  conditions changed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most significant of these reforms, the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act,
required automatic, across-the-board spending  cuts (called a sequester) if
Congress failed to meet the deficit  targets prescribed in law. Gramm-Rudman was
successful in  reducing small differences between projected and prescribed
deficit  targets, but it broke down when the deficit became so large in 1990 
that Members of Congress refused to allow an automatic spending  cut to take
effect.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The 1990 budget deal scrapped Gramm-Rudman and  instituted statutory caps on
discretionary spending. But these have been  adjusted numerous times, so they
have served as little more  than &quot;speed limits&quot; on the spending
expressway, since they were set  far above anticipated spending growth rates.
Moreover, since  they focused only on discretionary spending totals, ignoring 
fast-growing entitlement spending, these caps have had limited effect  in
bringing down the deficit.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD: ON BALANCING THE BUDGET</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite a campaign promise to balance the budget in five  years while
providing tax cuts for working families, President  Clinton resisted
congressional efforts to enact a balanced budget plan  with tax cuts in 1995. In
addition to vetoing the Balanced Budget Act  of 1995, Clinton presented four
budget plans to Congress during  the year  each falling far short of balancing
the budget, according  to the Congressional Budget Office. After a year of
prodding,  Clinton presented a fifth budget plan on January 5, 1996. CBO
certified   at least on paper  that this new proposal would balance the  budget
by 2002. Closer review of this plan shows that, as with the  four previous
plans, the White House was not serious about either  balancing the budget or
providing meaningful tax relief. It  seemed interested only in finding ways to
spend more taxpayer  dollars while appearing to agree that the budget should be
balanced.

<P><B> Clinton Budget #1: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</B>
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to  the 1994 election
results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget  to the new Congress. This
budget deviated little from &quot;baseline&quot;  forecasts which projected $200
billion deficits through the end of  the decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to CBO, the President's February budget would  increase the
deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to  $276 billion in 2000.
Spending would grow an average of 5 percent  per year, some $422 billion in all
in just five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The February Clinton budget was not all bad, however. It did  propose a few
modest privatization initiatives, such as selling  the Power Marketing
Administrations, portions of the Strategic  Petroleum Reserves, the Naval
Petroleum Reserves, and portions of  the National Weather Service. It also
proposed terminating a  few small programs and consolidating some 270 programs
into 27  new programs. Best of all, the budget proposed a &quot;Middle Class
Bill  of Rights&quot; which included a modest $300-per-child tax credit  for
families with children below age 13 who earn less than  $60,000 per year. But
the Administration did little to fight for any of  these proposals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 19, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote  of 99 to 0.

<P><B>Clinton Budget #2:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional  bal
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  anced budget efforts while
offering no plan of his own,  Clinton presented a second budget plan which he
claimed balanced  the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>This Clinton plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better  than his
first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in  addition to not balancing
the budget, this plan would produce $200  billion deficits for at least the next
ten years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second budget plan also included the modest tax cut for  families with
children in addition to tax deductions for higher  education and expanded
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later  said that this
plan would balance the budget in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the CBO maintained that it would never balance  the budget. Indeed,
CBO found less than $400 billion in  legitimate deficit reduction in this
Clinton offer  $350 billion short of  the total seven-year deficit reduction in
the Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #3:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget  Act of 1995, he
presented yet a third budget plan. The  Administration claimed that this plan
also would balance the budget in seven  years but was more in line with the
President's priorities than the one  he had vetoed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers  failed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  to reach a balanced budget by
2002. While this budget plan  proposed larger savings from discretionary
spending programs  and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also 
proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's  third
budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit  reduction over seven
years  $365 billion short of the savings achieved  by the BBA he had vetoed.
Moreover, according to the CBO,  instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as
advertised, it would leave  a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #4:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with  congressional leaders,
Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But  this plan was mostly an iteration
of Budget Plan #3 and contained  no new policy recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The CBO scored this plan as $69 billion out of balance in  FY 2002. The
Administration tried to make up its shortcomings  in reducing the deficit by
challenging CBO technical and  economic estimates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's  economic
assumptions were too conservative and thus required  excessively deep spending
cuts to balance the budget. In making  this argument, the Administration wanted
to have it both ways.  While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it
actually wanted  to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 18, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412  to 0.

<P><B>Clinton Budget #5:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan.  This plan,
largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats,  was certified by CBO to
balance the budget in seven years, at least  on paper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is likely that Clinton never would have submitted this plan had  it not
been for the conditions Congress included in the  continuing resolution passed
on January 5, 1996. These conditions  stipulated, in effect, that a bill to
provide operating funds for  unappropriated federal programs through January 26
would not be sent to  the President until he submitted a seven-year balanced
budget  plan scored by the CBO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years,  the fifth
Clinton budget falls far short of being a credible plan.  The reasons:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In the fifth Clinton budget, most of the heavy lifting of
deficit  reduction is required in the two years following the end of  Clinton's
possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the  plan's $583
billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002.  For example, the
plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings  over seven years, but 63
percent of these savings are to come in the  last two years. Similarly, the plan
called for $37 billion in  discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed
to achieve a  &quot;hard freeze&quot; in these programs, yet 95 percent of these
additional  savings fall in the last two years of the plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in 
gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these  cuts are
sunsetted in FY 2001  one year before the budget is  balanced. This means taxes
would have to be raised. Mathematically, such  a ploy &quot;boosts&quot; tax
revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002  and thus requires fewer spending
cuts to achieve a balanced  budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal is
reduced by the  plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing &quot;corporate
 loopholes.&quot;  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these  tax
hikes would be received in FY 2002.

</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #6:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This  sixth budget plan
in a year moved only slightly beyond the  previous plans, modestly increasing
the proposed savings from  Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly
boosting the size  of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce
nearly  $160 billion less in budget savings than the last congressional offer 
and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction. Moreover, the  White House
still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare,  Medicaid, and welfare needed
to achieve budget savings and  restructure the programs.

</P>
<P><B> Clinton Budget #7</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on  January 18. This
budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9  plan except that it
substantially increased the amount of new revenues  it 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  would generate from closing &quot;corporate
tax loopholes&quot; and  other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the
net size of  the tax cut would be reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven
years.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past  year, the FY
1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February  5, would force hard-working
Americans to pay higher taxes in  exchange for more spending on programs which
have become  old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization,
 or transfer to state control. Moreover, each plan ignores the  fundamental
problems facing the government's major entitlement  and welfare programs.
Clinton has shirked his responsibility to  address, for instance, a Medicare
program facing insolvency, a  Medicaid program that is bankrupting state
budgets, and a welfare  system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these cast suspicions on  the Clinton
Administration's sincerity in negotiating a balanced  budget plan with Congress.
At every turn, Clinton fought attempts  to cut spending or even reduce the
growth rate of spending.  Clinton challenged CBO's conservative economic
assumptions  because they required greater savings to balance the budget. In 
other words, he wanted more money for favored programs while  claiming to
support balancing the budget. Clinton repeatedly called  on Congress to reduce
the size of the BBA's tax cut package, not  because eliminating the tax cuts
would balance the budget any  faster (say in five years rather than seven), but
because smaller tax  cuts would allow more money for government spending. The
record  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  clear: Bill Clinton prefers
keeping money in the hands of  Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the
pockets of American  taxpayers.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Negotiations Stalemate</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By mid-January, the negotiations between Congress and the  White House had
reached a stalemate. Yet the job for both parties  of reaching a balanced budget
in seven years had been aided  considerably by CBO's December revised economic
forecast,  which showed that $135 billion less in spending cuts would be needed 
to balance the budget by 2002. Congressional leaders quickly  offered to reduce
their proposed savings from programs such as  Medicare and Medicaid in an
attempt to move toward common ground  with the President. In this offer,
congressional negotiators also  reduced the proposed size of the tax cut package
to $177 billion net  from $218 billion net. But this counter-offer made little
sense;  millions of families could be denied needed tax relief as billions of 
dollars more is spent on government programs they do not want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For all intents and purposes, congressional negotiators broke  off talks
with the White House after sensing that Clinton was not  serious  and, perhaps
never had been  about reaching an accord  to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the new Congress swiftly fulfilled the centerpiece of  the Contract
with America by drafting and then passing a  comprehensive plan to balance the
budget in seven years while providing  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  cuts to help families and spur
economic growth. The  Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was vetoed by President
Clinton, but it  nevertheless marked a dramatic reversal of Washington's &quot;business
 as usual&quot; attempts to deal with budget deficits. Though  Clinton signed
the largest tax increase in U.S. history just two years  ago, tax increases were
never suggested as a necessary element of  deficit reduction  even by the most
liberal members of Congress.  The dominant issues during the 1995 budget debate
were how to  curb the rampant growth of federal spending and how much tax 
relief should be given to hard-working American families. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As the year progressed, however, the new Congress's vision  of downsizing
the federal government and returning power and  resources to taxpayers and the
states was overshadowed by the  central issue of balancing the budget within
seven years. Thus,  many of the bolder reforms and initiatives contained in the
early  budget blueprints were watered down or abandoned in the battle with  the
Clinton White House. As the debate wore on into 1996,  voters' 1994 election
mandate to rein in the federal government took  a back seat to the &quot;green
eyeshade&quot; math involved in reaching a  balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The House Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 18, 1995, the House of Representatives, spurred by  73 freshman
Members, by a vote of 238 to 193 passed its  sweeping budget blueprint  formally
known as the budget resolution   to balance the budget in seven years while
providing over $350  billion in tax cuts to help families with children, to help
seniors,  and to spur economic growth. The blueprint called for $1.13 trillion 
in total spending cuts over seven years and, after netting out the  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  cuts, over $970 billion in
deficit reduction over the same period. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of the bolder proposals contained in the House budget  resolution were
generated by freshmen Members. Indeed, with the  encouragement of the House
leadership, a cadre of freshmen  developed serious plans to close four Cabinet
agencies: the  Departments of Commerce, Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban
 Development. The abolition of three of these agencies (Commerce,  Energy, and
Education) was incorporated into the final plan.

<P>
</P>
<P>Though ambitious by Washington standards, the Senate  plan (which passed on
May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42) fell short of  advancing the bold proposals
contained in the House blueprint.  For example, the Senate plan proposed closing
only the Department  of Commerce even though Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) 
became an active supporter of the House freshman effort to  close four Cabinet
agencies. In fact, some Senators wanted to go  beyond 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  the House effort and developed
proposals to close two  additional agencies: the Departments of Transportation
and Labor.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The most disappointing aspect of the Senate plan was the  absence of
specific tax cuts. The Senate plan allowed for unspecified  tax cuts for
families and economic growth only if CBO certified  that the plan would balance
the budget in seven years. Once this  certification had been made, tax cuts
could be financed with the  $170 billion economic windfall, or &quot;Fiscal
Dividend,&quot; the CBO  estimated would accrue to the government from lower
interest  rates and the increased tax revenues generated by higher  economic
growth.

<P><B>Completing the Balanced Budget Plan</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The task of producing the final balanced budget plan  proceeded along two
fronts: the appropriations process (funding  particular agencies and programs)
and the authorization process  (changing such things as tax laws and
entitlements to conform to  spending goals). Specifically, the appropriations
committees in the  House and Senate are responsible for drafting the 13
appropriations  bills that fund the day-to-day operations of the government. The
 authorizing committees, including the House Ways and Means  Committee and
Senate Finance Committee, are charged with  making changes in permanent law
affecting entitlement programs and  tax policy. By law, Congress must complete
all of its work on the  bud
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  get by September 31, before the
fiscal year begins on October 1. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress faced many serious questions as it undertook this  enormous task.
Would the budget, for instance, be completed on time?   If appropriations bills
are not completed by the end of  September, government programs must shut down
due to a lack of funds.  This scenario later became known as the first &quot;train
wreck.&quot;  Also,  Congress needed to pass the reconciliation bill, which
makes  the changes in permanent law, by mid-November when the  government was
expected to exhaust its legal authority to borrow  money. If the permanent debt
ceiling was not increased in time, the  Treasury faced the possibility of
defaulting on its loan payments  and not having the funds available to pay
Social Security benefits.  This became known as the second &quot;train wreck.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, conservatives  including most House freshmen   had other concerns
as well. For instance, would the  appropriations committees follow through on
the bolder proposals in the  House budget resolution to overhaul and terminate
some programs,  privatize others, and send many back to the states?  Also, many 
worried about the commitment of the Ways and Means and Finance  Committees to
tax cuts. Though the budget resolution  recommended $245 billion in tax cuts to
help families and promote  economic growth, Ways and Means and Finance are not
obligated to  follow its recommendations. The question became, would the &quot;tax
 writers&quot; become the &quot;tax cutters&quot;?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Appropriations Bills: &quot;The 10% Revolution&quot; </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The balanced budget outline passed by Congress in May 1995  required that
annually appropriated spending be reduced by $24  bil
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  lion, or nearly 10 percent. But,
with only a few notable  exceptions, rather than meet these spending goals by
overhauling  domestic programs, terminating obsolete agencies, privatizing 
commercial functions, and transferring non-federal functions to the states,  the
104th Congress chose a &quot;salami-cut&quot; approach to  restructuring
government. In other words, Congress shaved relatively  equal amounts from all
programs in order to achieve the savings  required by the balanced budget
outline, which means that most of the  appropriations bills continue the status
quo, albeit at reduced  spending levels.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Example:</B> </P>
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The appropriations bill for the Departments of  Commerce,
Justice, and State would have spent $27.3 billion in  fiscal year 1996, an
increase of 2 percent over the previous year.  President Clinton vetoed this
bill on December 19, 1995. Little  progress was made in eliminating the
Department of Commerce.  Moreover, the Economic Development Administration, a
perennial source  of funding for purely local projects, was granted $349
million.  The Small Business Administration, which as early as 1963 was 
described by <I>Life</I> magazine as a &quot;device for soaking up money  and
getting rid of it,&quot; <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#19">19</A></TT></B>
was appropriated $590 million. But the bill  did take some positive steps. For
example, the Advanced  Technology Program  corporate welfare and industrial
planning at its  most blatant  would have been eliminated. The bill also would 
have converted the cops-on-the beat program into a block grant to  localities to
allow flexibility in fighting crime.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The appropriations bill for the Department of  Energy and

of Engineers, a favorite  source 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  of funding for local pork-barrel
projects, received a mild cut of  5.6 percent. This still left plenty of money
to fund such efforts as  the $304,000 investigation of the Upper Trinity River
basin in  Texas; the $4.4 million beach erosion project in Sarasota County, 
Florida; and the $100,000 beach erosion project in  Surfside-Sunset-Newport
Beach, California. Only 18 percent was cut from the  Department of Energy's
Energy Supply, Research and Development  program. Since 1977, the federal
government has spent over $70  billion in today's dollars on this program and
has little or nothing  to show for it.

And the $934 million  Cooperative State Research Service is cut by only 3
percent. This  mild reduction left room for such spending as $220,000 for 
lowbush blueberry research in Maine, $1.2 million for potato research,  and
$395,000 for rice modeling in Arizona.

<P>The record of the Reagan Administration's proposals to  terminate programs
shows that simply reducing the budgets of such  wasteful programs as these 
instead of terminating them outright   leaves the door open for future
Congresses to boost their funding and  thus return the government to the path of
increasing deficits and  burdensome taxes. This happens because a bureaucracy is
left in  place to work with interest groups toward the re-instatement of 
funding. According to the Congressional Research Service, 94  programs were
recommended for termination during the two  Reagan terms.<TT><B><A

<P><B>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to liberal rhetoric, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995,  as passed by
Congress on November 17 and vetoed by  President Clinton on December 6, did not
slash spending to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Had the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) been signed into law,  federal spending
would have slowed from an average projected rate of  4.8 percent per year
through 2002 to an average of 2.76 percent  per year  roughly the average rate
of inflation. However, over  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  next seven years, total federal
spending would have grown by  21 percent, or $318 billion, from $1.518 trillion
in FY 1995 to  $1.836 trillion in FY 2002  the year the budget is to be in
balance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Driving this spending growth, even under a balanced  budget scheme, is
the rapid growth of entitlement programs. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the BBA, overall mandatory spending was allowed to  grow by $341
billion over the next seven years, a 46 percent  increase. On average, mandatory
spending would grow by 5.6 percent  per year. Contrary to White House charges of
Congress's &quot;deep  cuts&quot; in entitlement programs, the share of the
budget devoted to  this uncontrollable spending would grow from 48 percent of
all  federal spending in FY 1995 to 58 percent in FY 2002, even if the  BBA
effected needed reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare  programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only category of federal spending that would have  declined under the
BBA is discretionary, or annually appropriated,  spending. The BBA would have
reduced aggregate spending for  these programs from $546 billion in FY 1995 to
$515 billion in  FY 2002, or 5.6 percent. However, these modest cuts are &quot;scored&quot;
 by CBO as totaling $408 billion in savings over seven years. How  can this be? 
Nearly 55 percent of these savings, or $258 billion,  comes from &quot;freezing&quot;
aggregate discretionary spending at 1995  levels for seven years. Because CBO
assumes spending to grow,  spending the same amount as the previous year &quot;saves&quot;
money. The  remaining $151 billion in savings represent real cuts in  spending,
meaning that less money will be spent in future years than today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA contained $245 billion in gross tax cuts, or $218  billion 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  in net cuts after deducting the
$27 billion in revenues  generated from closing special tax breaks for certain
corporations and  industries. Though often criticized by the media and the 
Washington elite, the tax cut plan actually is rather modest. Overall, it 
promises to return to taxpayers roughly 2 percent of the $11.5 trillion in  tax
revenues the government expects to collect over the next  seven years. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As Table 5 shows, the tax cut plan is targeted largely to  families, though
the pro-growth tax cuts would have a substantial impact  on spurring new
investments and jobs. Highlights of the tax cut  plan include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts for Families.</B> A full 65 percent of the overall
tax  cut package was targeted to families, especially families with  children.
The &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the congressional plan was the  $500-per-child
tax credit benefiting 28 million families raising 51  million children. Also
included was a gradual increase in the standard  deduction for couples filing
jointly as a modest way of alleviating  the marriage penalty. The plan also
contained a substantial  $5,000 adoption credit and a $1,000 deduction for
families who care  for elderly family members.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts for Jobs and Economic Growth.</B> The remaining 35
 percent of the tax cut package was targeted to spurring jobs and  economic
growth. The centerpiece of the pro-growth tax cuts  was capital gains tax
reform. The effective capital gains rate for  individuals would be cut in half 
19.8 percent would be the top rate   and the corporate rate would be set at 28
percent. The plan  would have promoted savings by creating a new &quot;American
Dream  IRA,&quot; or back-loaded Individual Retirement Account. Taxpayers  could

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  contribute to these accounts
using post-tax dollars, but  withdrawals would be tax-free. The plan also
included reforms in the  Alternative Minimum Tax (ATM) and taxes on estates and
gifts.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts to Promote Health Care Independence.</B> The tax
cut  plan included two small but important tax provisions to help  seniors with
health care costs. The first provision would have given  more favorable tax
treatment to long-term care insurance, in the  same way other health care
insurance is treated. The plan also  would have allowed tax-free treatment for
terminally ill individuals  who cash out their life insurance plans.

<P><B>LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There was a great deal of speculation during the summer of  1995 about
whether there would be a &quot;train wreck,&quot; or general  shutdown of the
government, in the fall. &quot;Train wreck&quot; is really a  generic term since
there are two basic ways in which government  spending could come to a halt in
any given year:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Government programs lack the authority to spend, or
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. The Treasury lacks the authority to borrow money to  finance
government spending.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each scenario has interesting yet important nuances. By law,  the
appropriations bills must be passed by Congress and signed by  the President by
October 1 of each year. If a bill is not approved  by that date, programs within
its jurisdiction must cease  operations. Entitlement programs such as farm
programs, Social Security,  and Medicare, however, continue at current levels
because their  spending levels do not require annual appropriations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What happens if appropriations bills are not approved?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SCENARIO #1: </B>Congress passes a continuing resolution. 
What has happened most often in previous budget stalemates is  that Congress
passes a continuing resolution (CR) to fund  appropriated government programs at
the previous year's spending levels until  a compromise between Congress and the
White House is reached.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SCENARIO #2:</B> Essential programs continue through 
executive powers. The now-famous Civiletti interpretation of the  &quot;Anti-Deficiency
Act,&quot; named after former Attorney General  Benjamin Civiletti, outlined to
Jimmy Carter in 1981 how the President  can continue &quot;essential
expenditures in cases of imminent  emergency, to protect lives or property.&quot;<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#21">21</A></B></TT>  This authority by most 
accounts includes &quot;essential workers&quot; performing such functions as 
White House and congressional duties; Defense, Coast Guard, and  FBI/police
functions; meat and poultry inspection; and Air  Traffic Control. Since this
power rests with the President, it is difficult  for 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  the White House to argue that
Congress is responsible when  meat inspections, for example, are halted.

</P>
<P><B>The Shutdowns of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There were two general shutdowns of the federal government  during the
budget debate of 1995-1996. The first showdown  between Congress and President
Clinton occurred when Congress failed  to approve all 13 appropriations bills by
the October 1 deadline.  An immediate shutdown was averted, however, when
Congress  passed on September 29, and Clinton signed a day later, a short-term 
continuing resolution bill to fund government programs through  November 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When talks between Congress and the White House broke  down before the
November 15 deadline, Congress passed another  short-term spending bill which
the President vetoed on November  13. This veto brought on the first general
shutdown, which lasted  six days. Nearly 800,000 people  about one-third of all
federal  workers  were furloughed. Essential workers remained on the job,  but
without pay (though congressional leaders assured  furloughed workers that they
all would receive back pay). Also on the job,  but with pay, were workers in
agencies whose funding bills had  been passed and signed by Clinton. These
included some  Pentagon workers and employees within the Departments of 
Agriculture, Transportation, and Energy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second  a partial shutdown and the longest federal  shutdown in history 
lasted from December 16, 1995, until January 6,  1996. This time, rather than
send the President a new continuing  resolution, congressional leaders decided
to send him the actual  appro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  priations bills for the remaining
unfunded portions of the  government. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#22">22</A></B></TT>  The shutdown occurred
because Clinton vetoed the  bills funding the departments of the Interior,
Veterans Affairs,  Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, State, and Justice. 
Approximately 280,000 federal workers were sent home during this  second
shutdown.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Shutdown's Limited Impact</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most media attention during the shutdowns was focused on  federal workers
who were left temporarily without a  paycheck, <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#23">23</A></B></TT> companies closing because
of a lack of government contracts, and  &quot;innocent&quot; travelers shut out
of national parks and museums.  However, lost in the media coverage was the
silver lining: a glimpse into  an America with a limited federal government.
Lawmakers and  citizens alike should look carefully at the lessons to be learned
 from such a large-scale federal government closure.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Lesson:</B> As the Chief Executive, it was Clinton who 
determined which agencies and government employees were deemed  essential,
meaning those most directly involved in protecting the lives  and property of
American citizens. The President's choices, then,  are telling because they
indicate exactly where the true priorities  of the federal government lie. These
choices are also ironic in light  of Clinton's claim that he vetoed the Balanced
Budget Act of  1995 because it was too harsh on education, the environment, and 
housing. During the second shutdown, the Administration decided  large portions
of these same programs were &quot;non-essential.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Lesson:</B> Most taxpayers are unaware that many federal 
functions halted during the shutdowns were quickly assumed by the  private
sector or state governments. The competence shown by these  private and public

an excellent indication of why  they should be privatized or transferred to
local government control.

<P><B>The Debt Crisis Showdown</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second showdown occurred over the issue of increasing  the $4.9 trillion
legal debt ceiling (last increased in 1993), which  was to be done by November
15. On November 9, Congress passed  a short-term increase in the debt ceiling,
but with certain  conditions such as terminating the Department of Commerce and
a  prohibition against divesting retirement funds to cover government  debt.
Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, throwing into  question the ability of
the Treasury to make interest payments on  government debt and, possibly,
December Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Generally speaking, if the debt ceiling is not statutorially  increased, the
Treasury runs out of authority to borrow money  to fund spending not covered by
tax revenues. In other words,  the government is forced to operate more or less
on a cash basis.  Treasury then must fund programs out of tax and fee revenues
or  employ a variety of techniques to stretch its borrowing ability. It  has
managed as long as 30 days on a cash basis, Congress in  most years passes
temporary debt increases (six during the 1990  budget deal alone) to get
Treasury through the negotiations.

<P>
</P>
<P>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin avoided the possibility of  default during
the November 1995 crisis by disinvesting the Civil  Service Retirement and
Disability Trust Fund. He justified this action  by cleverly interpreting a
section of the Civil Service  Retirement Trust Fund Act<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#31">31</A></B></TT> to allow the U.S.
Treasury to take  Treasury bonds out of that trust fund. Moving Treasury bonds
out of  the Civil Service trust fund reduced the debt to below the legal  limit,
thus enabling the Treasury to sell additional bonds to the public.  If Rubin
chose to tap the entire $375 billion in this trust fund,  it would be adequate
to sustain this financing trick until May 1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many Members of Congress have challenged the  Treasury 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Secretary's interpretation of the
law and are looking at ways  to close the loophole, which they say undermines
Congress's  power to set a federal debt limit. Moreover, many fear that Rubin 
could fund the government indefinitely by raiding other trust funds.  The
federal government maintains a number of special trust funds  to hold and invest
certain kinds of special payments, such as  Social Security, motor fuel tax
receipts, and airline ticket taxes, as well  as the Civil Service funds.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. government bonds, in which money paid to these  trust funds is
invested, have always been counted as part of the  national debt that Congress
could control by setting a statutory limit.  But the legal interpretation
advanced by the Treasury Secretary is  that the government owes this money to
itself, and the &quot;investment&quot;  of the trust fund balances in Treasury
bonds is not real. It is only  a convenient fiction used by the Treasury to
compute periodic  interest payments to the trust funds, so the Secretary is free
to  disinvest from the trust funds and sell new bonds to the public.

</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The White House worked actively to kill the Balanced  Budget Amendment by
convincing Senators who previously had voted  in favor of it to reverse their
positions at the last minute. During  his February 25, 1995, radio address,
Clinton claimed the  amendment is an &quot;extreme fiscal policy&quot; that &quot;in
its most exaggerated  form, [is] what helped to turn the economic slow-down of
the 1920s  into the great depression of the 1930s.&quot;
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration however, did support the work begun by  the 104th
Congress on giving a line-item veto to the President. In  his March 25, 1995,
radio address, President Clinton stated,  &quot;[The line-item veto] will bring
more discipline to our spending  process by enabling presidents to veto
particular projects which are  unjustified, but which today can be hidden in
comprehensive bills  the president has to sign.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But the White House also has perfected the art of misleading  the public
with baseline budgeting. The most egregious example  is Medicare. Throughout the
past year, Clinton falsely charged  that Congress was insisting on
unconscionable cuts in Medicare.  The truth is that Medicare spending would
escalate dramatically  under the BBA, just not as fast as expected under the
artificial  CBO &quot;baseline.&quot;  Clinton also conveniently forgets to
mention that  his own plan would reduce Medicare spending below the  projected
baseline, though not as much as Congress's plan would.  According to CBO
estimates, cumulative Medicare spending over the  next seven years will total
$1.824 trillion.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#32">32</A></B></TT>
 Clinton proposes  spending a total of $1.733 trillion over the next seven years
on  Medicare, $91 billion less than projected. Congress, by contrast, proposes 
to spend $1.685 trillion during the same period, roughly $140  billion less than
projected but just $49 billion less than Clinton.  Thus, there is a difference
of less than 3 percent between how  much Clinton wants to spend on Medicare and
Congress's proposal.  This is hardly draconian.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress came in with an ambitious budget  reform agenda that
included passing constitutional amendments to  balance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  the budget and provide the
President with a line-item veto. In  addition, the new Congress promised to
bring honesty to the  budget process by eliminating typical congressional tricks
such  as &quot;baseline budgeting,&quot; in which increases in spending are 
called &quot;cuts&quot; because they fall below the spending levels projected by
 the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although often stymied by the White House and old guard  lawmakers, the new
Congress had a good year trying to bring  needed reform to the budget process.
The Balanced Budget Amendment  to the Constitution received overwhelming support
in the House,  only to lose by one vote in the Senate. Congress also advanced 
legislation to provided the President with a line-item veto and  enacted rule
changes to remove some of the trickery from the budget  process.

<P>Some of the more important budget process issues addressed  by the 104th
Congress include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Balanced Budget Amendment.</B> In 1995, both the House  and the
Senate considered constitutional amendments that would  provide for a balanced
budget by the year 2002. While the  House overwhelmingly achieved the two-thirds
majority needed to  send the proposal to the states for ratification, the Senate
fell one  vote short of the 67 votes needed when liberal Senators who 
previously had supported the Balanced Budget Amendment reversed  their position
under heavy lobbying from the Clinton Administration.

<P>
</P>
<P>Fiscal conservatives in the House and Senate attempted to  include a tax
limitation provision in the Balanced Budget Amendment  requiring a supermajority
(three-fifths) vote in both houses to  increase taxes. Unfortunately, that
effort fell short in both  chambers. Such a safeguard is justified because, as
shown in Chart 1 in  this section, the deficits of the last 25 years have been
caused  by spending increases rather than by taxes that are too low. Without  a
tax limitation provision, a balanced budget requirement could  be used as a
justification for tax increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Line-Item Veto. </B>The Line-Item Veto Act (H.R. 2, part of  the
Contract With America) was approved by the House and  Senate, but the two
versions differed widely. The House version, known  as enhanced rescission,
would allow the President to single out  specific items in spending bills for
reconsideration by Congress.  The Senate version would split appropriations
measures into  multiple bills for separate action by the President. After a
lengthy  conference, House and Senate negotiators agreed on a plan that  follows
the House's enhanced rescission approach.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Used conscientiously, a line-item veto could cut wasteful  spending without
jeopardizing necessary programs. State experience  shows, however, that the
line-item veto alone is not likely to result in  huge budget reductions,
although states have found it to be a fairly  effective curb on spending growth
over time. Moreover, it serves  as a check on the usual tendency of legislators
to lard  appropriations bills with pork-barrel spending designed to garner
additional  votes  both for the majority party in Congress and the individual 
Mem
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  ber back home. The President of
the United States would join  the chief executives of 43 states in being able to
use this weapon to  cut spending if the line-item veto is approved.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Byrd Rule.</B> Section 313 of the Budget Act is the  so-called Byrd
Rule, which prevents &quot;extraneous&quot; provisions from  being included in
the reconciliation bill. The rule was proposed by  Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) a
decade ago to prevent adoption of  a particular provision with which he was
unhappy. Unfortunately,  it has resulted in a long-standing problem in the
Senate. A  provision deemed out of order under the Byrd Rule must face a 
three-fifths vote (60 votes) to survive intact. In 1995, more than 45 
provisions were ruled extraneous and summarily removed from bills.  Among the
lost items were:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Limitations.</B> The House did adopt a supermajority  provision
regarding tax increases as a House rule. Since this House  rule would not have
the same standing as a constitutional  amendment, it would not apply to the
Senate and could easily be changed if  a new Congress decided it no longer
wanted to live under it.  However, House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has
promised a  vote around April 15, 1996, on a constitutional amendment that 
would prevent big-spending Members of Congress from using the  drive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  toward a balanced budget as an
excuse to raise taxes on  hard-working Americans. It is significant that the
vote on the  House rule change received significant support from both sides of 
the political aisle. The vote was 279-152, or 65 percent in favor   just short
of the two-thirds needed for a constitutional amendment   with 52 Democrats
voting for the rule.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Scoring Rules.</B> One of the most significant disputes in the 
confrontation between the President and Congress over the Balanced  Budget Act
of 1995 was the question of &quot;scoring.&quot;  The President  argued for the
use of Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) spending and revenue estimates to
judge whether the budget  deal met the requirement of balance by 2002, while the
Congress  stood by the more conservative predictions of the Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO). Using the President's OMB numbers would  have permitted
hundreds of billions in additional spending over  seven years. If Congress and
the President are serious about achieving  a balanced budget, it makes sense to
use the numbers that  produce the most spending cuts; this leaves the greatest
likelihood that  the budget will be in balance when the plan predicts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lock Box.</B> Another concept which could help reduce spending,  the &quot;lock
box,&quot; was approved in preliminary form by the House  in 1995. Currently, if
the House or Senate adopts a specific  spending cut, the savings can be diverted
to spending increases on other  programs. This becomes particularly troublesome
in conference  committees where back-room deals are cut. The lock box bill 
establishes congressional and Treasury procedures to ensure that  votes in
Congress to cut specific spending programs translate into  overall deficit
reduction. Under this plan, internal congressional  spending caps applying to
the 13 appropriations bills would be  lowered 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  whenever the House and Senate
vote to cut a particular  program. The savings would be totaled by the Treasury
Department,  which then would reduce overall spending caps for both Congress and
 the executive branch. Even if fully implemented, however, this  plan, like the
line-item veto, is unlikely to produce major spending  cuts, though it would
discourage hypocrisy.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Truth in Budgeting.</B> The Contract With America contained a  provision
that required House committees to compare new  spending recommendations to how
much was spent on a program in the  previous year. Under the old system,
tax-and-spend liberals had  the upper hand because spending increases were
judged not  against actual spending for the previous year, but against 
projected<U> </U>spending for the next year. With these rules, even a spending 
increase could be called a cut, as happened frequently during the  Medicare
reform debate in 1995. The House rules change applies only  to House committee
reports, however, and not to all government  budget documents.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>1995 was the year Congress faced up to the task of making  tough decisions
on the budget, while the Administration chose instead  to avoid them  and even
maintained that no hard decisions  needed to be made. Conservative candidates
thus must explain to  Americans that Congress sought to institute needed
reforms, only to  be thwarted by the Clinton Administration. And with or 
without White House support, conservatives must commit themselves  to finishing
the job. If Congress and Clinton fail this year to agree  on a seven-year plan
to balance the budget with substantial tax  cuts for families and economic
growth, the first task in 1997 must be  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 61 -->  deliver a new plan to the
President as soon as possible.  Equally important, however, conservative
candidates must commit  themselves once more to overhauling and downsizing the
federal  government.

government in a way that protects Social Security and  national defense, yet
produces the spending cuts needed to balance the  budget and pay for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vision outlined in the Heritage plan is one of a  government focused
solely on functions that are national in scope. The  routine functions of
government, such as cutting checks at the Social  Security Administration, or
those departments concerned with  nar
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 -->  rower functions, such as
operating National Parks, would be  reduced to sub-Cabinet level or independent
status. Activities  more appropriately delivered by the states would be
transferred to  local control, and services better provided by the private
sector  would be fully privatized. Functions which have become outmoded, 
inefficient, or broken beyond repair would simply be terminated.

<P><B>Federalism, Privatization, Termination</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, the conservative agenda for restructuring the federal  government
for the 21st century should be based on three sound  principles:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Federalism:</B> Transferring non-federal functions to state and 
local governments;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Privatization:</B> Transferring non-governmental functions to  the
more effective and efficient private sector; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Termination:</B> Eliminating programs which have become  outmoded,
obsolete, inefficient, or broken beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Principle #1: Federalism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, Congress should enact a budget that makes it clear  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 66 -->  the first responsibility of the
federal government is an  adequate national defense. Congress then should
examine every other  program to determine whether it is truly national in scope
and can  be carried out on a national scale only by the federal  government.
Funding for all agencies and programs that fail to meet this  test, such as many
education, welfare, health, transportation, and  other programs, should be
transferred to the states or returned to  the people as federal tax reductions.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, the Heritage plan called on Congress to take the  following
actions, among others:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Close down</B> the Department of Education, moving most of

programs into a single block grant and limit the overall growth  in spending for

<P>

<P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Principle #2: Privatization </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, conservatives should articulate clearly the distinction  between
those activities that are the exclusive responsibility of  the public, or
government, sector and those that should be the  responsibility of the private
sector. In addition, they should describe  areas in which, while there is a
public purpose, the activity still  should be carried out by private
institutions, either directly or under  contract to government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress should commit to an intensive privatization,  or
denationalization, effort to reassign essentially private functions  to the
private sector. Such an initiative is long overdue in this  coun
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  try. Governments throughout the
world, from Russia to  Mexico and from Japan to Great Britain, have been
redefining the role  of government in a private economy. These governments are 
denationalizing state-owned enterprises, cutting subsidies to  inefficient
industries, removing barriers to private investment, and  restoring property
rights. Yet the U.S. government continues to control  hundreds of private
activities and functions such as public utility  management, railroad services,
small business loans, printing and  publishing, agriculture subsidization, and
oil extraction and storage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In some cases, privatization provides the only hope for many  inefficient
and unreformed programs starved for capital due to  federal budget constraints.
In the private sector, investment flows to  enterprises that can produce
valuable goods and services. Other  countries have used private capital to
finance major  infrastructure projects with a public purpose. The $9 billion
tunnel between  England and France, for instance, was financed almost entirely 
with private capital. By contrast, infrastructure financed and  maintained with
public money tends to be chronically undercapitalized,  as budget pressures
cause public investment to be deferred in favor  of current public consumption.
Privatizing commercial functions  can yield considerable short-term revenues
while greatly  improving the efficiency of services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the private sector, selling unproductive or underperforming  enterprises
is a common practice. Scott Paper CEO Al Dunlap,  who orchestrated the largest
corporate restructuring in history, says  that &quot;Inside every corporation is
the biggest bank one is ever going  to find  its own assets. Before you go
looking for outside  funding look first at what you don't need.&quot;<TT><B><A

to move into the next century.  Conservatives should focus on restoring the
balance of spending power  between Congress and the President by passing such
measures as  the Balanced Budget Amendment and the line-item veto.  Congress
also needs to clean its own house. Conservatives should  centralize spending
authority within a few accountable committees and  enact other rule changes to
safeguard taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specifically, the 105th Congress should:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Send a balanced budget/tax limitation amendment to the 
states.</B> Congress should promptly consider a constitutional  amendment that
provides for a balanced budget by the year 2002 with a  requirement for a
supermajority (three-fifths) vote to raise  taxes. Unless these requirements are
specified in the Constitution,  the nation is doomed to an endless string of
broken promises and  accounting gimmicks that permit politicians to say &quot;just
wait  five more years&quot;  over and over again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pass a Balanced Budget Enforcement Act. </B>Congress should  enact and
the President should approve a new budget process  designed to implement the
requirement for a balanced federal budget.  The package under discussion by the
House's Cox-Largent task force  is an excellent starting point. Among the
important features of  that proposal is a budget resolution, signed by the
President, that  sets out overall spending, revenue, and deficit figures for the
year.  This resolution would have to be adopted before any other spending  or
budget legislation.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 74 --> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Other essential features of budget process reform include  elimination of
the current services baseline, an annual review of  entitlements, a mechanism to
review regulatory costs, and a sequester  or other device to ensure that
spending and deficits stay within  established limits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each of the following reforms could be adopted either as part  of such a
reform package or separately.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Abolish the appropriations committees.</B> The 105th 
Congress should find the political courage to reorganize the  committee
structure to rationalize spending powers and build in  accountability. The
current three-layered congressional budgeting system  is both complex and
diffuse. Many committees of Congress have  the authority to spend tax dollars,
but no one is accountable if  such spending results in higher deficits. Studies
show that when  spending authority is limited to a few committees, Members are 
more accountable for their decisions, which result in minimal  deficit spending
and occasional budget surpluses. For example,  the Hoover Institution's John
Cogan found that congressional  spending decreased sharply in the 1920s after
spending power was  centralized.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#34">34</A></B></TT>  Combining authorizing
and appropriations  functions would eliminate one of the three layers in the
budget process  and strengthen the Budget Committee's ability to limit spending 
by permitting it, rather than the spending-oriented  appropriations committees,
to guide budget decisions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Uniting policymaking and spending decisions in the same  committees would
eliminate a severe bias in the appropriations  process. The fact that the House
and Senate Appropriations  Committees exist solely to spend tax dollars provides
a perverse  disincentive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 75 -->  against cutting spending. Every
dollar cut from the budget  represents a corresponding cut in the power of the
appropriators,  particularly the so-called Cardinals (subcommittee chairmen).
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Establish a lock box.</B> The 105th Congress should adopt
rules  to ensure that when Members vote for spending cuts, the savings  are not
secretly recycled into new spending. This reform would  make it much more
difficult for appropriations committees to  insert pork-barrel or controversial
spending in conference reports.  In addition, the direct tie to deficit
reduction might encourage  members to offer and support more amendments for
specific  spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Revise the Byrd Rule.</B> The Byrd rule should be modified to  permit
reasonable spending policy decisions to be included in the  reconciliation bill.
While the limited debate time in the Senate for  consideration of reconciliation
bills does help prevent legislation  from becoming a Christmas tree bearing all
sorts of extraneous  provisions, the current structure of the rule prevents
Congress and  the President from adopting important reforms that directly affect
 how the taxpayers' money is spent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Introduce truth in budgeting. </B>The practice of baseline  budgeting
should be eliminated, and all government budget  documents should indicate the
change in actual spending from one fiscal  year to the next. As discussed in the
chapter on government reform,  the House and Senate also should adopt rules
requiring witnesses  to disclose any federal funding they receive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Conduct an entitlement review. </B>Congress and the President  should be
required to reexamine entitlement spending at the same  time 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 76 -->  they consider the appropriations
bills. It is fiscally irresponsible  to spend months feuding over one-third of
the federal budget  while scarcely noticing the major drain on federal
resources:  entitlement programs that consume most of the annual budget. The 
regular review should include a careful study by the appropriate  committees of
the programs within their jurisdiction and should result  in roll-call votes in
the House and Senate that, at the very least,  force Congress and the President
to acknowledge the current and  future levels of these programs. Annual budget
resolutions should  establish spending ceilings for all mandatory spending
programs,  except for interest on the national debt, as is now done for 
discretionary (appropriated) spending. Committees with responsibility for 
mandatory programs would be required to revise these programs  to limit spending
accordingly. The nation no longer can afford  to confer benefits on classes of
people with no regard for the cost  to the American taxpayers.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Introduce biennial budgeting.</B> If the congressional budget  process
were expanded from an annual to a biennial process, much  time would be freed to
permit a more careful analysis of policy  revisions. A two-year budget would
permit Congress and the  President to spend much more time debating the
fundamental role of  government and how to revise and improve existing federal 
programs. While biennial budgeting may be a useful reform, however, it  must not
be adopted without the other urgent reforms noted in this  section. Two-year
budgeting on its own would merely create a  higher-stakes &quot;train wreck&quot;
and cause more harm than good. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why not balance the budget in nine or ten years rather  than 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 77 -->  seven?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There are two main reasons why balancing the budget  sooner
rather than later is necessary. First, taking nine or ten years to  balance the
budget would mean larger deficits in each year. The  cumulative effect of these
larger annual deficits is a larger  national debt and larger annual interest
payments on the national debt.  For example, a ten-year &quot;glidepath&quot;
balanced budget would add  $467 billion more to the national debt than the
congressional  Balanced Budget Act of 1995 over the next ten years, resulting in
 additional annual interest payments of $19 billion in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, increasing the time frame for balancing the budget  increases the
likelihood that future Congresses will not  follow through on the necessary
spending reductions and program  reforms. Five Congresses and at least two
Administrations would  be responsible for fulfilling a ten-year balanced budget
plan. It is  impractical to assume that these future lawmakers will restrict 
themselves to decisions made ten years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why cut taxes at a time when we're trying to balance the  budget?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Tax cuts are essential in any balanced budget for two  reasons.
First, tax cuts should be thought of as the ultimate form of  devolution.
Reducing the spending patterns of the federal government  is not enough. We need
to return power to the most basic levels,  the primary one being the individual
household. Parents who are  able to keep more of the money they earn will make
better choices  for their children's education than the federal government.
Senior  citizens who are able to realize more of their retirement savings  will

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 78 -->  be better able to choose a health
plan for themselves than  Uncle Sam. All of these choices are possible only if
people can  keep more of their hard earned money.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, tax cuts are needed in a balanced budget to ensure  a strong
economy. Initially, balancing the budget requires that  government reduce its
role in the economy. In the short term, this  can slow the economy, but
returning money to the private sector  by means of the $500-per-child tax credit
will help to offset  these negative effects. Also, tax cuts to spur investments 
(particularly cuts in the capital gains tax rate) will increase economic growth 
in the long run. This higher economic growth means more  jobs, higher incomes,
and lower prices.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why did Congress insist on giving a huge tax break to the rich?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite the liberal rhetoric, the tax cut package passed by 
Congress as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would have  benefited all
Americans, including the working poor and the  middle class. Sixty-five percent
of the entire package would flow to  families. The $500-per-child tax credit
would benefit 28 million  families raising 51 million children, 89 percent of
whom earn  below $75,000. Moreover, the congressional family tax cut  package
would have eliminated the entire income tax burden of 3.5  million families
raising 8.7 million children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even the capital gains tax cut would benefit all Americans.  Fifty-two
percent of the capital gains tax cut would go to  households with an annual
income of less than $100,000. The capital gains  tax cut also would spur the
economy and promote increased  economic 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 79 -->  efficiency, which leads to more
and better paying jobs  among other benefits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In light of these facts, it is also ironic that many Democrats,  including
members of the Clinton Administration, would cast  the congressional plan as a
tax break for the rich. It is even  more ironic since the President's original
tax reduction plan would  have denied tax relief to more than five million
families earning  less than $30,000 when compared to the Republican  plan.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#35">35</A>
</B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is a spending increase labeled a spending cut?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Each year the Congressional Budget Office issues a  &quot;baseline&quot;
projection of federal government spending. This is an estimate  of the amount of
money that will be spent on each program funded  by the federal government, from
Medicare to AmeriCorps. Put  simply, baseline budgeting is a way to forecast
future levels of  spending, tax revenues, and deficits. Any proposed or enacted 
changes in federal spending and tax policies thus are measured  against these
projected benchmarks to produce estimated cuts or increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, last year the Congressional Budget Office  estimated that
between 1996 and 2002 the federal government would  have spent $12.8 trillion.
In contrast, the Balanced Budget Act  called for $11.8 trillion over the same
period. Even though spending  under the balanced budget plan would have
increased each and  every year, because it would have increased more slowly than
 projected, it is considered a cut.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What economic benefits can I expect to see from a  balanced budget
with tax cuts?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 80 --> 
</B></P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The immediate benefit for many Americans is tax  relief, whether
it is the $500-per-child tax credit or a lower capital  gains tax rate. In the
longer run, every aspect of economic activity  will benefit from a balanced
federal budget with tax cuts.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't blaming the process just a way of shirking real 
responsibility?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Members of Congress certainly must remain  responsible for
their votes and their legislative records, but the current  rules actually
conspire to raise spending and taxes. The roadblocks  to reducing government and
putting more money in the  taxpayers' pockets are immense. By reforming the
budget process, the  accountability of Congress and the President  will<U> </U>increase,
not decrease, because the hurdles to cutting taxes and spending will  have been
removed. The only factor will be the actions of Members,  not arcane rules
created by the defenders of big government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't the line-item veto give too much power to the President?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. A narrowly crafted line-item veto that permits the  President
to send individual spending items back to the Congress for  reconsideration
increases accountability and decreases the  likelihood that pork-barrel projects
will be squirreled away in the  appropriations bills. While this reform alone
will not reduce federal  spending levels significantly, it will provide a
beneficial check on  the current spending tendencies of congressional
appropriators.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Q. Why must a tax limitation provision be included in the  Balanced
Budget Amendment?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 81 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Without a requirement for a supermajority vote to  increase
taxes, the chances are good that Congress will resort to tax  increases
(probably disguised as something like &quot;revenue  enhancements&quot;) that
increase the financial burden on hard-working  Americans. The American people
will make sacrifices as the size of  government is reduced and should not be
insulted by being told  they must pay higher taxes because the politicians in 
Washington couldn't find the courage to make the tough decisions on  spending
cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can the American people be confident that Congress  and the
President won't resort to phony numbers and accounting  gimmicks to balance the
budget?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Balanced Budget Amendment would represent  significant
progress toward effectively reducing the size of government  and returning money
to the taxpayers' pockets. Anyone concerned  that politicians might try to
circumvent a constitutional balanced  budget requirement should be even more
concerned about what  Congress has done in the absence of a balanced budget
mandate.  Effective enforcement provisions and political vigilance by  votes
would be necessary. The 31 states which have balanced  budget requirements have
been able to meet them regularly, even  when difficult decisions were required.
Congress can, and should, do  the same.

<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government regulations affect all Americans: from the food  they eat, to the
medications they take, to how they use their  private property, to how they run
their businesses. Excessive  government regulation today is vast in scope and
staggering in its impact,  both on individuals and on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government regulation has shown itself to be both  far-reaching and
counterproductive in its impact on American business. It  increases the cost of
doing business and hiring workers, which  results in fewer jobs and lower
salaries and makes U.S.  companies less competitive in world markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The burden is bad enough, but much regulation also is poorly  designed and
thus unnecessarily costly. Federal regulatory  agencies do not have a system for
making rational, well-informed  decisions on how to allocate limited resources
most efficiently to  maximize health, safety, and environmental  protection.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>  Today,
Americans spend approximately $170 billion a year just complying with  rules
designed to protect the environment. The total cost to the  economy of all
regulation is estimated to be between $600 billion and  $700 billion annually.
This represents a hidden tax of more than  $6,000 per year per family. The
regulatory process must be reformed  so 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  that government resources at all
levels can be allocated more  rationally and business can devote its resources
to becoming more  innovative and productive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although the direct costs of regulation typically are imposed  on businesses
and governments, ultimately they are passed on  to American consumers in the
form of higher prices, reduced  quality or availability of products and
services, or higher taxes. In  addition, regulation can increase the cost of
employing workers  and thus act as a tax on job creation and employment. For 
example, American businesses must carry the costs of federal labor laws  that
constrain the freedom of companies to hire and fire workers and  to engage in
negotiations with employees and labor unions.  Similarly, employers often are
required to provide such benefits  as health insurance, unemployment insurance,
workers'  compensation, retirement benefits, paid family leave, or child care  
the costs of which are passed on to consumers through higher prices  or to
workers through slowdowns in the creation of new jobs or  reductions in wages.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>  Federal
mandates on state and local  governments also may force the diversion of
resources from other  government priorities such as education, police, and fire
services.  To continue providing these services, state and local government  may
be compelled to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vast majority of Americans agree that some government  regulation is
desirable and necessary. Most highway regulations,  for example, save lives and
improve the flow of traffic at  minimal cost. Such regulations obviously provide
a huge net benefit to  everyone, but regulations also can be both
counterproductive  and harmful to society. The problem is that regulation today
is  far more costly and less effective than it should be.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates and legislators should focus on  bringing common
sense to the regulatory process in 1997 by enacting  reforms that incorporate
five key principles:<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#3">3</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Cost-Benefit analysis.</B> Federal agencies should be required  to
consider the benefits and costs of a range of regulatory  alternatives and
choose the options that maximize net benefits to society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Sound science.</B> Agencies should seek the most advanced  scientific
knowledge available.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Risk assessment and risk management.</B> Agencies must  develop more
scientifically objective methods to determine the nature  and extent of a &quot;hazard.&quot;
 The process for assessing risk should be  distinct from the process for
determining what risks are significant  or unacceptable and how they should be
managed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Risk-based priorities and public education.</B> Agencies  should
prioritize their regulatory actions based on a consideration of  risks, how
those risks compare to risks familiar to the public, and  the costs of reducing
them. Agencies also must educate the  public about their risk-setting
priorities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5. Market incentives and performance standards.</B> To the  extent

<P>Estimating the precise cost of federal regulation is extremely  difficult.
Unlike federal spending, regulatory costs are not  accounted for in the budget
process; and while agencies are supposed to  calculate the costs and benefits of
proposed  regulations, <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#5">5</A></B></TT>
their calculations vary in quality and often grossly underestimate the true 
cost or substantially overestimate the benefits of  regulation. <TT><B><A

called for the application of cost-benefit  analysis to new rules and
regulations. The idea was to force  Congress and regulatory agencies to assess
the costs and benefits of  regulations before they are enacted. Critics argue
that too often the  costs and benefits of a regulation are hard to identify and
quantify,  and that it is difficult to place a dollar value on a human life that
 may be saved by a regulation.

on regulatory  reform: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  &quot;One reason why the cost
estimates appear so outrageous is  that the risks the regulations are trying to

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  nesses and state and local
governments to comply with  unnecessary and costly mandates. A business forced
to spend $10  million to comply with a particular regulation has less money to
pass on  to workers in the form of higher wages or new jobs. Similarly,  state
and local governments must forego other types of services  (education, police,
or fire) or raise taxes every time they are required  to implement a new federal
mandate.

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     While President Clinton is critical
of the federal  government's overregulation, his actions do not match his
rhetoric. In fact,  even as Clinton calls for change, his Administration appears
even  more aggressive than its predecessors in wielding its regulatory power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     For example, on October 4, 1993, President
Clinton issued  Executive Order 12866, &quot;Regulatory Planning and Review,&quot;
replacing  a Reagan Administration order requiring executive branch  agencies to
submit proposed regulations with a cost in excess of $100  million to OMB for
review and approval. In the new executive  order, the Clinton Administration
reaffirmed its commitment to 1)  using the best scientific and economic data; 2)
using analysis to  inform decision-making; 3) considering flexible,
cost-effective  performance standards; and 4) allowing early public
participation in  an open and accountable regulatory process. However, there is 
little evidence that the order has had any significant impact or that  the White
House is encouraging agencies to comply. An April  1995 study by the Institute
for Regulatory Policy examined all EPA  proposed and final rules published in
the<I> Federal  Register</I> during the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  second six months after the
Clinton executive order took  effect. Based on an analysis of 222 substantive
rulemakings, the  study found only six for which the demonstrated benefits
justified  the costs involved. In addition, only 14 examined regulatory 
alternatives, and only eight of these specified that the most  cost-effective
rule had been adopted. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>On February 21, 1995, President Clinton directed federal  agencies to
conduct a page-by-page review of existing regulations to  determine which should
be eliminated and which should be  streamlined, updated, overhauled, or
otherwise improved. By June 1,  the Administration claimed the agencies had
identified over  16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that they
 would be eliminating. In addition, they supposedly are &quot;reinventing&quot; 
over 31,000 additional pages. The challenge now is for the public  to figure out
what this all really means. While the number  sounds impressive, when put in the
proper context it is considerably  less impressive. Today's CFR is more than
131,000 pages, more  than twice as large as it was twenty years ago. Eliminating
 16,000 pages is only about 12 percent of this total, and that is  assuming that
no new regulations are added in the interim, which is not  the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On November 28, 1995, the Administration published its  1,700-page
semiannual agenda of federal regulations, which  presents very brief
descriptions of all planned regulatory actions.  The Administration's lack of
seriousness in achieving real  reductions in burden is evident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting,  review, and
reporting requirements for a number of programs, the  Clinton 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  Administration is simultaneously
pushing forward with  burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the
universe  of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release 
Inventory. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#46">46</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The Administration has reviewed the Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) in an
attempt to &quot;strengthen and streamline&quot; the  rules. However, this
streamlining process resulted in more than  140 pages of new CRA rules and
regulations. As Congressman  Bill McCollum (R-FL) notes, &quot;Only in
Washington can streamlining  be defined as going from a rules that takes up 14
pages in the  Federal Register to one that takes up 145 pages.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, a number of agencies admit that they have not  reviewed their
rules for twenty to forty years. Some of the  pages being eliminated are for
rules for which the underlying statute  has long since been repealed, treaties
that no longer exist, etc.  This alone could easily achieve a 10 percent
reduction in the CFR  without accomplishing any real changes in the way in which
the  federal government goes about regulating the public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clearly, the Clinton Administration effort is windowdressing  and does
little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of  regulation. The
Administration is not being completely honest with  the American public when it
claims to be reinventing regulation  but goes about implementing new, burdensome
regulations about  as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has done little to change the  way in which
federal agencies regulate the public. In fact, it has  worked tirelessly to
block the enactment of comprehensive reform  legisla
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  tion that would codify many of
the principles found in  the President's executive order; the Administration
continues to  take the position that fundamental reform can and should be 
achieved through administrative change, not through statute.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 103RD CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the 103rd Congress, Members became more serious  about easing the
burden of federal red tape. Even though the  Democratic leadership and the White
House ultimately killed the main  reform efforts of 1994, four reform measures
either passed one house  of Congress or received serious consideration by
congressional  committees; until 1994, none of these measures was even given a 
hearing by the committee of jurisdiction. The proposals were  intended to reduce
the paperwork and regulatory burdens on  businesses, evaluate the economic and
employment impact of regulation,  and curb unfunded federal mandates. While
federal regulations  would continue to impose costs, the legislative proposals
were  intended to force Congress and the executive branch to consider more 
thoroughly the economic impact of proposed legislation and  regulation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1994, unlike past years, a strong grass-roots coalition  helped rally
bipartisan support for these bills and convinced  reluctant committee chairmen
that they could no longer block the  legislation. The business community became
a key part of this  coalition by actively supporting measures aimed at
controlling the  regulatory burden. Adding extra impetus to this effort was a 
powerful coalition of state and local officials who organized themselves  into a
potent political force to fight onerous federal regulations  and Washington
mandates that fail to provide the funding to  imple
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  ment them. In the end, however,
the efforts of these groups  were not enough to keep the congressional Democrats
and the  White House from blocking passage of any legislation.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulatory reform became a real political possibility with  the 104th
Congress. As part of the Contract With America, the  Republican majority made
one of its promises the passage of a number  of reforms designed to enhance
private property rights (see  Chapter 4) and economic liberty and make
government more  accountable for the burdens it imposes on individuals and
businesses.  During the first 100 days, Congress enacted and President Clinton 
signed into law two of its reform priorities:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</B> The federal  government
increasingly has been involved in activities considered to  be state and local
in nature. In response to the increasingly  hostile reaction of states and
localities to unchecked and costly  federal mandates, Congress enacted the
Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act of 1995 (Public Law 100-4), in March 1995. The Act
represents  &quot;a bipartisan agreement that something is wrong with American 
federalism as it has evolved in recent  years.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#47">47</A></B></TT>  The Act establishes a
$50 million threshold on the costs Congress and regulatory  agencies can impose
on state and local governments. A &quot;mandate&quot;  includes any requirement
that a state take an action, under the  threat of penalties or loss of
assistance, that would increase state and  local costs beyond existing levels.
New and reauthorized  legislation would have to specify how programs would be
funded. The  law also requires the Congressional Budget Office to issue an 
analysis of each piece of legislation containing a federal mandate.  The 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  analysis must describe the
mandate, specify its expected cost  to state and local governments, and state
whether it is to be partly  or entirely funded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In January 1996, the Advisory Council on Intergovernment  Relations (ACIR),
which is tasked under the Act to &quot;investigate  and review the role of
federal mandates in intergovernmental  relations,&quot; issued a preliminary
report with recommendations to  Congress for addressing existing federal
mandates on state and  local governments. State and localities identified more
than 200  separate mandates affecting them which involve more than 170  federal
laws. Among ACIR recommendations: revise the Safe  Drinking Water Act, the Clean
Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act  to promote greater flexibility and
increased consultation betwen  the federal government and states and localities,
and modify  the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Clean Water Act to 
reduce budgetary and administrative constraints. <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</B> Intent on lessening  the burden
imposed by the federal government on individuals  and businesses, the 104th
Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and
President Clinton signed  it into law on May 22, 1995. The Office of Information
and  Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the White House Office of  Management and
Budget (OMB) is responsible for implementing the Act's  objectives. In March
1995, the Office of Management and  Budget estimated that Americans spend more
than 6.4 billion hours  during fiscal year 1994 filling out forms, answering
survey questions,  and compiling records for the federal government.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#49">49</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The law, which came into effect in October 1995, sets a  govern
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  ment-wide paperwork reduction
goal of 10 percent in each of  the first two years after its enactment and 5
percent from fiscal  1998 through 2001. It also reauthorizes for six years the
Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs, which remains responsible for 
carrying out the law. The Act's most controversial provision  would overturn a
1990 Supreme Court decision holding that OMB's  authority under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 did not  extend to regulations forcing businesses to
provide information to  third parties, including employees and the public. The 
reauthorization provides that all third-party paperwork requirements will be 
approved by OMB, and this is expected to increase OMB's review  of paperwork by
50 percent.

<P><B>Corrections Day.</B> A regular Corrections Day has been  established for
passing corrective and non-controversial legislation with  bipartisan
supermajorities (three-fifths). Through this process,  Congress is able to
revise regulations that have become outdated or  obsolete, correct agency
errors, or simply eliminate regulations that do  not make any sense. In the
House, the Speaker's Correction Day  Advisory Group, chaired by Representative
Barbara Vucanovich  (R-NV), reviews and recommends legislative proposals for 
consideration under the Corrections Calendar. Bills on the calendar can  be
considered at the discretion of the Speaker of the House on  the second and
fourth Tuesday of each month. The following are  two examples of bills passed by
one or both houses of Congress:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act (S.790)</B>
to  abolish or reduce the statutory requirement for a list of over 200 
congressionally mandated reports, and to require the President to  submit his

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act (H.R. 436)</B> to require  the
government to differentiate between petroleum oils and animal  and vegetable
fats, oils, and greases. The Oil Pollution Act of  1990 places prohibitive
financial requirements on oils and does not  distinguish between non-toxic,
biodegradable animal and  vegetable oils, which are less of an environmental
hazard, and  petroleum products. The Department of Transportation was going to 
implement the Act through regulations that would have required  24 hours of
hazardous material classroom and field training for  workers who responded to
butter or salad oil spill emergencies.

<P><B>Congressional Accountability and Regulatory Relief for  Small Business.
</B>In response to the recommendations of the White  House Conference on Small
Business, Senator Christopher Bond  (R-MO), chairman of the Senate Small
Business Committee,  sponsored S. 942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
 Fairness Act of 1996. This bill passed the Senate with a vote of 100 to 0  on
March 19, 1996. The bill authorizes judicial enforcement of  the Regulatory
Flexibility Act of 1980, allows small business to  recoup expenses and legal
fees incurred when agencies make  excessive demands for penalties that cannot be
sustained in court  and provides for an independent ombudsman to receive 
confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with  federal
regulators. In addition, the bill was amended by Senator  Nickles (R-OK) and
Senator Reid (D-NV) to allow Congress 60 days  to review agency regulations.
This amendment effectively  incorporated a previously approved Senate bill (S.
219) that provided  for such congressional review. The House already had passed
a  similar small business legislation (S. 926) in March 1995. The  House and
Senate finalized the bill and attached it to legislation to  raise 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  the debt ceiling. The President
signed the bill on March 29, 1996.

<P><B>Industry Deregulation</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the  Communications Act of 1995,
signed into law by President Clinton on February  8, 1996, which is the most
important industry-wide deregulatory  initiative undertaken by Congress in over
a decade. The Act  removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing
telephone, cable  and broadcasting competition. Specifically, the Act

<P>Although the legislation is an important step, more extensive  initiatives
are still needed to eliminate subsidies and regulations,  end the socialization

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, other important legislative regulatory reform  efforts have
been stalled by the Democratic congressional leadership  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  the White House.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Four other important reform proposals also were considered by  the 104th
Congress:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. A Moratorium on Regulation.</B> After the November 1994  election,
Republican Members of Congress asked President Clinton  to freeze new federal
rulemaking during the first 100 days of the  new Congress. When President
Clinton refused, the House of  Representatives passed H.R. 450, the Regulatory
Transition Act of  1995, which would freeze regulatory activity retroactively
from  November 20, 1994, until 1996 or the passage of regulatory reform 
legislation. The purpose of the bill was to provide for a &quot;time-out&quot; 
period, during which Congress and the Administration could  debate and study the
large number of regulations currently being  developed and evaluate proposed
efforts to reform the way in  which regulatory decisions are made and
implemented. Although  the Senate bill started out the same way, a substitute
bill requiring  that all federal rules lie before Congress for 45 days to be
reviewed  and &quot;vetoed&quot; before becoming final ultimately was passed. 
Because the two versions turned out to be significantly different, the 
House-Senate conference on the bills stalled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Comprehensive Regulatory Reform.</B> Just two months into  the first
session of the 104th Congress, the House passed H.R. 1022  on February 28, 1995.
Although the Contract With America was  a Republican election platform, H.R.
1022 was passed with a  substantial bipartisan majority. The purpose of the bill
is to impose  a requirement  on existing statutes and new regulations  that  the
risks, costs, and benefits be considered before implementation  of new rules.
Where the estimated economic impact is $25 million  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  more agencies would be required
to conduct risk assessment,  as necessary, before regulations take effect. In
addition, they  would be required to evaluate the costs and benefits associated
with  the set of regula-tory alternatives, including no government action;  to
show that the benefits outweigh the costs and that the net  benefits to society
would be greater under the proposed rule than  under alternatives; and to assess
the effect on businesses with fewer  than 100 employees and the effect on
employment. A federal  agency's compliance with the requirements of H.R. 1022
would be  judicially reviewable under the statute granting the agency the 
authority to act and, where applicable, under the Administrative  Procedures
Act.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, comprehensive regulatory reform proposals in  the Senate were
killed by the Democrats and the White House.  Two bills in the Senate were the
focus of the debate. The  Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, S. 343,
sponsored by  Senator Robert Dole (R-KS), started out prescribing the risk and 
cost-benefit studies in a manner similar to that found in H.R. 1022. The  bill
also would allow citizens to petition agencies to apply  cost-benefit analysis
to regulations already on the books. The Regulatory  Reform Act of 1995, S. 291,
sponsored by Senator William Roth  (R-DE), was less prescriptive, giving federal
agencies more latitude  to make regulatory decisions. The standard for weighing
the  costs and benefits of regulation also was less stringent than in the 
original S. 343. Eventually, the Senate's efforts focused on S. 343,  and the
Democrats and the Clinton Administration were successful  in negotiating changes
with Senate Republicans that severely  weakened the bill relative to similar
provisions found in H.R.  1022. Despite the concessions to Democrats, supporters
of the bill  were unable to garner the necessary 60 votes to impose cloture on 
de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  bate, and the bill stalled in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. &quot;Sunset&quot; and Review.</B> Many believe the regulatory 
system would be more reasonable if the law required that agencies  review and
revise their rules periodically and if those regulations not  re-evaluated
within the prescribed time could no longer be  enforced. Senator Dole's
comprehensive regulatory reform bill  contained &quot;sunset&quot; and review
provisions. In March 1996, the House  attempted to incorporate a bill sponsored
by Representative  David McIntosh (R-IN) that would require agency review of 
regulations into a package of reforms that included small business relief  and
congressional accountability. Strong opposition to this type of  review, from
the White House, House Democrats, and public  interest groups, brought the
renewed House effort to move even a  modest regulatory bill in 1996 to a
standstill. The Senate then moved  forward with a bill that included
congressional accountability  and small business relief. This was conferenced
with an earlier  House-passed bill that did not include administrative review
and was  sent to the President and signed on March 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress must pursue regulatory reform efforts that not  only streamline the
way in which the federal government issues  rules, but also improve the
underlying scientific data, information,  and analysis used to make decisions
about how or whether to  regulate. A major reason regulation imposes such
tremendous costs is  that Congress and the executive branch often regulate
without  adequately weighing the burdens placed on employers and the  increased
cost to the economy in terms of jobs and  competitiveness. The following reforms
can build upon existing regulatory  review 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  mechanisms to force the
government to prioritize regulations,  assess their costs and benefits, and
adopt the least burdensome  approaches.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen White House oversight of executive branch agencies.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Executive branch agencies are required to submit proposed  regulations to
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  (OIRA) within the Office of
Management and Budget. OIRA was  created by the 1980 Paperwork Reduction Act to
reduce federal  paperwork burdens, and President Reagan added to OIRA's 
responsibilities by issuing an executive order requiring executive branch 
agencies to submit proposed regulations to it for review. But if the  White
House does not make deregulation a priority, OIRA allows  agencies a long leash.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Legislation should be adopted to establish OIRA's statutory  authority and
responsibility to review regulation. Because  OIRA's regulatory review function
currently is derived solely from  executive order, a new Administration that
disagrees with this  function could withdraw it simply by revoking the
applicable  order. OIRA's authority also should be expanded beyond the  existing
executive orders to cover rulemaking by independent  agencies such as the
Federal Communications Commission and  Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish in statute a set of principles to guide  regulatory
decisionmaking.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The regulatory process needs to be reformed so that scarce  economic
resources can be allocated more efficiently to achieve  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  most good. The concept of smarter
regulation is an important  one to understand in the regulatory reform 
debate.50  The following principles are key elements of this concept:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cost-benefit analysis.</B> Federal agencies should be
required  to evaluate the costs and benefits of all new regulations. Critics 
will argue that costs and benefits can be difficult to identify or hard  to
quantify, and this may be true. Nevertheless, it is very useful  to begin to get
agencies to think more systematically about the  economic impact of new
regulations by requiring an accounting  and weighing of costs and benefits, to
the extent possible, in  making their decisions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Sound science.</B> Federal agencies should be required to use the  most
advanced and precise scientific methods to calculate the risk  estimates that
form the basis for agency decisions, and  regulations should be updated to
reflect changes in that scientific  knowledge. Unfortunately, agencies use
extremely conservative or  worst-case assumptions to make up for the lack of
data and high degree  of scientific uncertainty that characterize the current
risk  assessment process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Risk assessment and risk management.</B> Risk assessment  methods need
to be improved (for example, by using sound science),  and agencies need to
establish a clear distinction between  assessing risks and deciding how to
manage them. Federal agencies  should work closely with the scientific community
to improve risk  assessment guidelines. Today, agencies too often allow policy 
decisions about how to manage risk to influence the determination of  risk. Only
when a risk is identified should a policy decision about  how to handle it be
made.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Risk-based priorities and public education.</B> Government has a 
responsibility to inform the public of risks and to minimize the  distortion and
exaggeration of those risks. By using risk  comparisons, federal agencies can
help the public understand the familiar  risks they face every day, such as
being struck by lighting, and  how these compare with unfamiliar risks, such as
exposure to a  particular chemical in the community.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Market incentives and performance standards.</B> Whenever  regulation is
necessary, it should be accomplished to the extent  possible by setting a goal
and allowing the market to decide how it  will achieve that goal. For example,
instead of requiring businesses  to use specific technology to reduce pollution,
a regulation  should mandate the amount of pollution reduction and allow
businesses  to decide how they will achieve that reduction. Each business  then
has the freedom and the incentive to adopt the least costly  means of achieving
the goal for itself, minimizing the total cost  burden that compliance imposes
on the economy. In contrast,  command-and-control regulations provide no
incentive for the regulated  entity to exceed a regulatory goal.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish a regulatory budget.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President and Congress should establish a federal  regulatory budget
that places a ceiling on the total estimated cost that can  be imposed on the
economy each year by all federal regulations.  If the budget total was reached
by existing regulations, an  agency wishing to add a regulation with further
costs would have to  repeal or modify an existing regulation imposing the same
or greater  cost. A regulatory budget would place a politically accountable
limit  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  the total burden that could be
imposed on the economy by  federal regulation. It also would give agencies a
strong incentive to  review existing regulations to discover which could be
safely  eliminated or modified to reduce costs. Overall, government would be 
forced to prioritize its regulations and abolish the least beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require federal agencies to review existing regulations to  ensure that
they meet sound regulatory principles. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress codifies a set of principles for smarter regulation,  it also
should require that federal regulators go back and review  all existing
regulations to make sure they also meet those principles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Deregulate specific industries.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although reform of the regulatory decisionmaking process is  necessary,
policymakers also should continue to push for  deregulation of specific
industries. In the late 1970s and early 1980s,  Congress deregulated several
industries, including the airline, railway,  and interstate trucking industries
and natural gas. The 104th  Congress succeeded in making 1996 the year we see
significant  deregulation of the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress should continue the success of the 104th  Congress and take
action to deregulate the following industries:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Banking.</B> Congress should continue to deregulate the
banking  industry. Three specific areas of banking regulation need to be 
addressed. First, structural restrictions such as the Glass-Steagall  Act of
1933 retard bank stability and expansion and limit the  credit opportunities
banks can offer to businesses. Second, the  current 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  federal deposit insurance system
is a government-operated  safety net that distorts the banking industry at a
great cost to the  taxpayer. Finally, direct banking regulations such as the
Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) cost consumers and businesses millions  of
dollars each year without correcting the perceived problems  which they are
meant to cure. Banking deregulation will mean that  consumers benefit from being
able to make more profitable  investments, and businesses benefit from the more
efficient flow of  capital through the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Utilities.</B> Policymakers should completely overhaul  regulation
within utilities markets. All consumers should have the right  to purchase
electric services in competitive markets, but  customer choice in electricity
requires the deregulation of the existing  monopoly-controlled industry. The
Federal Power Act and the  Public Utility Holding Company Act are the major
federal statutes  that require the regulation of existing electric utility
monopolies.  Competition, not regulation, is the best way to spur innovation and
 the development of new technologies and services. Opening up  the utilities

<P><B>The Maritime Industry.</B> Congress should repeal the Jones  Act
(Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920), which  increases the
transportation costs of many U.S. businesses by requiring  that when their
merchandise is transported entirely or partly by  water between United States
points  either directly or via a  foreign point  it must travel in US. - built,
U.S.-flagged,  U.S.-manned, and U.S.-owned vessels. That monopoly raises costs.
No  other U.S. industry has such a costly lock on the economy. In  addition,

provisions that expose ships,  shipyards, terminals, and other companies in the
marine industry  to onerous open-ended liability claims.

</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't regulatory &quot;reform&quot; just another way of saying &quot;let's
 roll back twenty years of health, safety and environmental protection?&quot;
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Regulatory reform is an attempt to bring common sense  to the
way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how  to regulate.
Effective regulatory reform means smarter  regulation. One of the consequences
of making smarter decisions is that  we may decide a regulation is not needed,
and this means  reducing regulation. Republicans, like Democrats, want clean
air, clean  water, and safe food and consumer products. Unfortunately,  however,
federal regulators have not done a very good job of allocating  our scarce
economic resources efficiently to achieve these goals.  By making sure that
regulators sensibly and consistently  evaluate risks, compare them to the types
of risk faced by people every  day (such as driving a car or getting hit by
lightning), and consider  the costs and benefits of their actions, we can do an
even better  job protecting the environment and public health and safety  while
spending less.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What role should the federal government play in regulation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A. </B>Most Americans want society to regulate who can be a  doctor or
who can fly an airplane, or to decide what pharmaceuticals  are safe enough to
be placed on open shelves. But most also  would agree that there are good and
bad regulations, some that  make sense and others that are silly and
incomprehensible, and that  the benefits of some are simply not worth the cost,
while others  provide no benefit at all. The federal government should be 
required to consider certain questions about regulations to make sure  they
achieve their intended purposes. These questions include  whether the benefits
outweigh the costs, whether the level of risk  justifies the cost, whether the
regulatory solution being chosen  minimizes the disruption of the free market,
and whether the regulation  is understandable and easy to implement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How do you decide when the benefits of a regulation  outweigh its
costs?  For example, how can you decide how much one life  is worth?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Many ordinary daily activities pose a greater threat to  human
life than the hazards that are regulated. Such risks as driving  without a
seatbelt, which individuals can control, generally pose a  far greater risk than
certain pesticides. Yet the public focuses on  the risk from pesticide. A
10-minute bicycle ride poses the same  risk of death  one-in-a-million  as the
lifetime cancer risk  from wood-preserving chemicals. But only the latter is
regulated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because society has limited resources, it makes sense to  apply them where
the risks are greatest. Environmental regulation  alone 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  now costs America approximately
$170 billion annually.  That means lost jobs, which can pose a far greater risk
to the health  of an individual than many of the problems currently targeted  by
regulations intended to protect health. Thus, it is not a case of  putting an
acceptable &quot;price&quot; on a life, but of determining how  much risk is
avoided by one expenditure as opposed to another. Is  health improved more by
forcing firms to spend money on certain  costly pollution controls, for
instance, or by leaving them free to  spend the same money creating jobs and
improving living standards,  or even hiring more police?  A better appreciation
of risk and cost  has led both Democrats and Republicans to support prioritizing
 risks so that the nation's limited resources are used to deal with  the
greatest threats to human health.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What can be done to relieve the tax, paperwork, and other  regulatory
burdens on small businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The message from small business owners is loud and clear:  The
federal government gets in the way of their ability to survive  and thrive.
Following through on tax and regulatory reform will  give small businesses the
relief they need to create jobs and expand  the tax base. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today's tax system is a disgrace (see Chapter 2). Billions of  hours are
spent each year to comply with an increasingly  incomprehensible maze of tax
forms, regulations, and documents. In  addition, the current system of
deductions and loopholes is too easily  manipulated by special interests for
their own advantage.  Although the 1995 tax legislation makes a small step
toward easing  these problems, the need for fundamental reform is compelling. A 
flat tax would resolve many of the tax problems we face today. It  rep
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  resents a straightforward, fair
system that can be implemented  by two simple postcards, one for individuals and
one for businesses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, small businesses today face increasing federal  regulatory
burdens. Too often, command-and-control,  one-size-fits-all federal regulations
put small businesses at a disadvantage.  The cost of compliance falls
disproportionately on small  businesses. The 104th Congress took action to
correct these problems by  passing a small business regulatory reform bill in
March 1996.  This legislation takes step to make sure the economic impact of 
regulation on small businesses is taken into consideration. This  includes
evaluating the economic impact of regulations on small  businesses as well as
ensuring that small business interests are  adequately represented in the
development of regulations. Small  businesses, like any other businesses, also
should have the right to  challenge federal regulations in court, and courts
must have the ability  both to block the implementation of harmful and costly
regulations  and to require agencies to reconsider them.

</P>
<P>Americans want a clean, healthy environment. They also want  a strong
economy. But environmental protection is enormously  expensive, costs jobs, and
stifles economic opportunity. On the  other hand, before government stepped in,
robust economic activity  such as manufacturing led to a deteriorating and
unhealthy  environment. The challenge is how to achieve both a strong economy 
and a healthy environment. After all, what Americans actually want  is a high
overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Three decades ago, as people perceived that their quality of  life was
beginning to deteriorate, they began to support  aggressive policies to reduce
pollution. These policies frequently failed to  live up to their sponsors'
claims; they also became increasingly  and unnecessarily expensive. But the
environment did improve,  especially in the early years. Now, however, Americans
are  becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that,  even
when they work, they result only in small improvements at a  heavy cost in jobs
and freedom. Americans also are beginning to  recognize that there often is no
sound scientific basis for assertions  of environmental harm or risk to the
public. The pendulum  finally has begun to swing the other way. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives, like Americans generally, have no wish to return  to the days
of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks. But they  do believe common sense
can be brought to bear in dealing with  the environment: that it is possible to
protect the environment  without sacrificing the freedoms for which America
stands.  Conservative candidates and legislators therefore should stress the 
following themes:

conserving  or efficiently using  natural resources is not in dispute.  The

on sound science, not &quot;tabloid science.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Priority setting.</B> Candidates must explain that not all problems  are
of the same importance or urgency, and that regulating all  risks 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  equally means fewer lives are

</P>
<P>While pollution levels have fallen dramatically since 1970,  most reductions
were achieved early and at relatively low cost.  From 1970 to 1990, total
emission levels fell 33.8 percent. Over  the same period, lead levels in the air
fell 96.5 percent, and  carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 40.7 percent. But
reductions  have slowed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As recently as 1985, the annual cost of environmental  protection was $82
billion. Since then, it has more than doubled to $171  billion, while
environmental gains have slowed to a trickle. The  estimated $171 billion spent
in 1995 represents about 3 percent  of America's gross domestic product (GDP).
Put another way,  these poorly crafted environmental regulations cost each 
American household almost $1,800 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The pattern is consistent: What economists call the marginal  rate of return
on investment falls dramatically as government runs  out of easy fixes and then
attempts to eke out minuscule  improvements in the environment at skyrocketing
extra cost. The resulting  drain on the economy is both enormous and
unnecessary.

</P>
<P>Regulatory abuses like these usually are a direct result of the  way
government bureaucracies attack environmental problems.  Typically, these
agencies regulate without regard to the cost  imposed on individuals and
businesses. Yet it makes no sense to issue  a regulation for which the burden
far outweighs any benefit  that might be conferred. In fact, it often is unclear
whether there will  be any benefit at all because the science on which many 
regulations are based is so poor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also, instead of setting realistic performance standards and  giving
businesses the freedom to develop innovative ways of  meeting them, agencies
typically rely on inflexible  command-and-control regulations that, for example,
specify what technologies  companies must use. Since businesses differ in their
operating  structures, this one-size-fits-all approach rarely leads to
cost-effective  solutions compared to more flexible and dependable performance 
standards. Moreover, by eliminating the incentive for companies  to seek out
these cost-effective solutions, it stifles innovative  technologies or
techniques that reduce costs. In the end, of course,  the consumer is the one
who pays.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most troublesome aspect of current  environmental policy is the
fact that bureaucrats and liberal lawmakers  generally consider regulation the
only option. Creative solutions shown to  be less expensive, more effective, and
more respectful of human  liberty are rejected out of hand. Instead of setting
up a system of  incentives to lure businesses into operating with environmental 
impact in mind, the system relies on punishment regardless  of whether this
accomplishes the desired goal or creates  unintended consequences. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Rejecting Property Rights</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulations have become increasingly unfair. The  Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior (DOI),  Army Corps of Engineers, and
other federal agencies operate on  the premise that property should be used to
satisfy government's  needs and objectives without regard to who owns the
property or the  financial burden imposed on them. It is this mentality that 
leads government reflexively to reject the creative solutions advanced  by
free-market advocates, including incentive-based approaches  to protecting
endangered species. By ignoring property rights,  establishment
environmentalists, bureaucrats, and liberal legislators  also ignore the
benefits to be derived from free trade and free markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most unfair and burdensome hardship inflicted by  government &quot;regulatory
takings&quot; is that property owners are not  compensated for their losses. For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife  spend a large portion of their
retirement savings to buy land on which  to build their dream home and that land
subsequently is designated  a wetland, they lose the value of their property as
well as their  savings. They are stuck with property they cannot use and the 
government does nothing to reimburse them for their loss.  Unfortunately, tales
of financial hardship caused by government designation  of land as wetland or
endangered-species habitat have become  common. For instance:

<P>Hundreds of such stories have surfaced over the past few  years, and many
analysts suspect that far more are never made  public. According to Bob Adams,
Project Director for Environmental  and Regulatory Affairs at the National

<P>Ironically, federal agencies and the Clinton Administration  argue that it
would cost too much money to compensate  landowners. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  Leon Panetta, then Director of the
Office of Management  and Budget, told the House Committee on Public Works  and
Transportation's Subcommittee on Water Resources and the  Environment on May 26,
1994, that paying compensation for  wetlands regulation would be &quot;an
unnecessary and unwise use of  taxpayer dollars&quot; and a drain on the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Property owners counter that regulatory takings are a drain on  the family
budget. Nancie Marzulla, President of Defenders of  Property Rights, points out
that &quot;what people don't realize is that  these landowners typically are not
wealthy and powerful  corporations, but normal Americans  schoolteachers and
elderly couples   whose lives are destroyed by stretched interpretations of a 
single environmental law.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#8">8</A></B></TT>
 Moreover, the federal government  already owns about one out of every three
acres in the country (with  even more owned by state and local governments).
<A HREF="ftnt4.htm#9">9</A>  If the federal  government can
afford to maintain one-third of the nation's land,  it should be able to pay
landowners for regulatory confiscation  of their property. If not, maybe it
should consider selling the  least ecologically sensitive land from its vast
holdings to pay for  the land it wants.

<P><B>Lost Opportunities, Lost Lives</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ask the average American how much a human life is worth,  and the answer
likely will be that &quot;no amount is too much.&quot;  This  is how Congress
and federal agencies justify imposing  sometimes staggering costs on businesses
to reduce the risks of death by  infinitesimal amounts. What policymakers fail
to understand is  that wasting resources in this way means not being able to use
them  in other ways that might well produce better results and save  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  more lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If lawmakers ever did consider which environmental policies  actually save
the most lives, they would scrap many existing  rules, freeing up resources to
be used in other ways. This  commonsense approach would lead to regulation that
is very different, in  its scope and fundamental assumptions, from that which 
burdens America today. In fact, as the following charts illustrate, if  the
private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to  be left with the
industries or individuals concerned, or used in  other ways in the local
economy, in many cases Americans would  benefit more, and far more lives would
be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ill-conceived environmental regulations designed to  &quot;protect&quot;
people may even cause deaths. The best example is the set of  Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to  conserve energy and encourage lower
oil prices. The only way  auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building
lighter  cars. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, however, lighter cars 
are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. The result: more  highway
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham  of the Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis have found that 2,500  highway deaths should be
expected as a result of CAFE's impact  on the weight of cars made in the 1989
model year  alone. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#10">10</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some environmental regulations may cause deaths indirectly.  Statistical
analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs  the government imposes
on the economy, lower overall living  standards cause one additional statistical
 death. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>  When
this formula 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  is used to compare the number of
lives &quot;saved&quot; by a  particular environmental regulation with the
number lost through lower  living standards, it becomes obvious that many
regulations  actually increase the death toll. For example:

<P>When asked by the media, pollsters, or politicians, Americans  routinely
answer that they want a clean and healthy environment.  Indeed, the majority of
Americans consider themselves  &quot;environmentalists.&quot;  This does not
translate, however, into automatic  acceptance of the environmental lobby's
agenda. Conservative  candidates need to make this clear to discourage voters
from  supporting policies they do not believe in simply because they are 
portrayed as &quot;pro-environment.&quot;

</P>
<P>The dichotomy in public opinion shows up in polling data.  When respondents
are asked general or theoretical questions that  involve little personal
sacrifice, or that do not identify those  burdened, government intervention
fares well. In one poll, for instance,  60 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  percent of respondents agreed
that we must protect the  environment even if it costs jobs in the  community.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#13">13</A></B></TT>  In another,
72 percent of respondents said they would pay somewhat higher taxes  if the
money was used to protect the environment and prevent  water and air pollution.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, when respondents are asked questions that  are more
specific, that involve greater sacrifice, or that identify  the people losing
jobs, government intervention is less popular.  When respondents are asked to
pay much higher taxes to protect the  environment, support drops by almost half.
By the same token,  only one-third would be willing to accept cuts in their
standard of  living. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>

<P>More Americans than not believe that environmental  organizations are too
extreme  a perception that is partially responsible for  recent significant
declines in membership among these groups.  Perhaps the most consistent finding
is that Americans think EPA  is doing a poor job: More than two-thirds think the

<P>Perhaps the most refreshing change in attitudes in recent years  is the
recognition that the country can have economic growth  and environmental
protection simultaneously. Vice President Al  Gore has made the point that
economic growth and environmental  protection are not incompatible. This is
true, but only if  America's environmental laws are structured correctly to
encourage  responsible behavior as part of the business decision-making 
process. Gore advocates stringent command-and-control regulations  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  are inconsistent with growth and
lead to little real gains in  environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Whenever this question comes up, Americans must be told  that the way to
promote both environmental protection and  economic growth is to allow them to
work hand in hand. The  government must stop regarding them as mutually
exclusive and stop  pitting economic freedom against the environment. Laws must
be  based on, and work with, a free market. Only then can Americans  maximize
their economic and environmental quality of life.

</P>
<P>Given Americans' ambivalence on the question of  environmental protection,
it is all the more important for conservatives to  approach the issue in a
commonsense way. People must  understand that environmental protection need not
come at the expense  of jobs, but will cost jobs if the socialist model of
centralized  control for protecting the environment is not set aside. It doesn't
 work. Rather, the country should adopt a reasonable, commonsense  approach to
environmental protection that is based on:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> leftists and the public at large understand that

<P>&quot;Freedom with responsibility for one's actions&quot; should be the 
conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful  behavior. Ironically,
the old environmentalist slogan &quot;Make the  polluter pay&quot; is consistent
with this message. But when they say this,  conservatives and liberals mean
different things. As Al Cobb,  then Director of Environment and Energy at the
National Policy  Forum, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  has said, &quot;What the
environmental lobby means by that phrase  is that corporate polluters should be
punished severely for any  pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean,
however, is that  polluters should bear the full cost of environmental
degradation,  but no more.&quot; <TT><B><A

market  reflects the conservation ethic better than any command-and-control 
regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however,  only when private
citizens engage in trade, and people can trade  only what they own: some form of
property. Thus, property is the  cornerstone of a free market. If property
rights are insecure or  publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively.
Some  critics misleadingly call this &quot;market failure,&quot; but it is
really a failure  to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a 
result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. A  resource
that is not owned will deteriorate or be depleted  because neither protection of
nor damage to that resource is part of  the individual's usual decision-making
process. Others, however,  are still forced to bear the consequences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should concentrate on explaining the  innovative
ways in which property rights can be used to protect  the environment. The most

to enlist self-interest in  the service of environmental protection.

and Central African  elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million
to less  than half that. Yet, in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased 
dramatically. The difference is that hunting in Zimbabwe is  permitted as a
property right. Small villages that own the land on which  elephants live and
graze charge safari operators to conduct  hunts. Since the villages profit
directly, they have an incentive to  promote herd growth to increase their
income. In surrounding  African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to
curb  incessant poaching; in Zimbabwe, however, villagers are constantly on  the

conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and  prevents pollution
from entering his stretch of the river. If a  municipality pollutes the water

by chlorofluourocarbons (CFCs), a  refrigerant. After widespread media coverage

<P>Instead of merely responding to tabloid claims or politically  motivated
studies by federal agencies and environmental  organizations trying to justify
their budgets, regulations should be based on  credible scientific findings open
to public scrutiny. For instance,  agencies should use consistent methodologies
to determine risks.  Currently, they use different methods. Thus, for example,
risk  assessments by different agencies may turn up different answers as  to
whether a chemical at a particular dose level causes cancer.  Theoretically,
exposure to some level of a chemical could be found  to be both deadly and
perfectly safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government assessments also should reveal the assumptions  and uncertainties
in their analyses. Typically, because of missing  data, most studies use certain
assumptions to estimate these  uncertainties. These assumptions, sometimes
unreasonably gloomy,  usually determine the conclusion reached. For instance,
sometimes an  estimate of the likely risk from some chemical is multiplied 
thousands, or even millions, of times just to be &quot;conservative.&quot;  Yet 
the analyses used to justify these enormously expensive  regulations often are
obscure as to their assumptions. Moreover, the  reports 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  rarely reveal the level of
uncertainty involved in arriving at  their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Whenever regulations that address risks are considered,  each agency should
be required to conduct risk assessments  if only  to aid in intelligent
decision-making  that are consistent, that  are transparent to public scrutiny,
and that fully detail their  assumptions and levels of uncertainty. Moreover,
each study should  be reviewed before a regulation is pub-lished to ensure that 
scientific guidelines are strictly followed. If federal agencies cannot  meet
even this very limited standard, it is unconscionable for them  to impose costly
standards on others.

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     The Need To Set Priorities.</B> The economy has a
limited capacity  to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country 
cannot afford to eliminate every risk. Thus, there is a trade-off:  Attempting
to regulate one risk out of existence may mean that  another risk (or other
risks) will have to be tolerated. In most cases,  the cure is worse than the
disease. Misguided and excessive  regulation can cost lives, so it is critical
that regulators recognize the costs  of their actions. Spending enormous amounts

cannot  be used in other productive ways  public or private  that might  be of
greater benefit to the nation.

Regulating these  less serious risks costs the economy enormous sums while

<P>This is why it is essential that policymakers develop a priority  list of
environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible  risk each appears
to pose and the cost of reducing that risk to  acceptable levels. With such a

dollar spent.  Americans finally will get the maximum environmental &quot;bang

a rare metal on my property, its value goes up.  But if a rare bird occupies the
land, its value disappears. We've got  to turn it around to make the landowner
want to have the bird on  his property.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#37">37</A></B></TT>  Hamilton's words
illustrate why environmental  laws that do not take individual rights into
account are  counterproductive. A serious problem has developed, known as &quot;shoot,
 shovel, and shut up.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#38">38</A></B></TT>
 Landowners that find, say, a listed plant on  their property sometimes pull the
plant rather than lose their life  savings. Even when landowners take no hostile
move against  species, few have any incentive to provide what endangered species
 need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  most: habitat. As Larry McKinney,
Director of Resource  Protection for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
says, &quot;While  I have no hard evidence to prove it, I am convinced that more
 habitat for the black-capped vireo, and especially the  gold-cheeked warbler,
has been lost in those areas of Texas since the listing  of these birds than
would have been lost without the ESA at  all.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#39">39</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the harmful effects from confiscatory  regulations,
encouraging the willing cooperation of landowners has led to  some striking
successes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps the most notable success story was the recovery of  the wood
duck which was rapidly headed for extinction early in  the century due to a loss
of nesting habitat and over-hunting.  Friends of the wood duck, in the best
tradition of voluntary association  and private conservation, spent the rest of
the century asking  the nation's private landowners to allow them to erect
artificial  nest boxes for the birds,&quot; says R.J. Smith, Senior 
Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. &quot;Most 
landowners were more than willing to help. There was no downside. If  the ducks
utilized the nest boxes, the landowners would not be  prevented from using their
lands. If we had had an ESA in 1920,  the wood duck would likely be extinct
today  instead of the  second most common duck in the eastern flyway. Similar
efforts  have worked for... bluebirds, screech owls, barn owl kestrels  (sparrow
hawks), purple martins, and even prothonotary warblers [as  well as] wild
turkeys, ruffed grouse, prairie chickens, and many  species of quail.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#40">40</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous controversies surround ESA, such as whether it is  appropriate or
worthwhile to protect endangered sub-species that  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  almost identical genetically to
other non-endangered  sub-species. But these are side issues. As currently
enforced, ESA forces  landowners  without compensation  to surrender many of 
their property rights if listed species are found. If the incentive  problem
that pits landowners against species instead of aligning their  interests was
eliminated, the threat to species would likely become  a thing of the past. But
this would occur only if the fear of  punishment for having habitat was replaced
with the promise of  reward for providing habitat. Issues such as which species
need the  most protection could be debated dispassionately with a view to 
getting the maximum return for public funds spent to preserve these  species.
Since federal wildlife managers would be forced to  implement the most efficient
and beneficial uses of those funds,  species most needing protection would be
the most likely to benefit.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Wetlands</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Wetlands, traditionally known as swamps or bogs, have been  disappearing at
a rapid rate during this century, primarily  because they are unique ecosystems.
They are valued by many  Americans for the very practical reason that they can
act as a buffer  against flooding and can purify streams and rivers. Others
despise  wetlands as &quot;mosquito-infested swamps,&quot; and they typically 
are breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes. While  most Americans
historically have fallen into the latter group,  increased public recognition of
the positive qualities of some wetlands  in recent decades has led to demands
for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the confusing and onerous nature of wetland  policy has made
wetland protection a politically contentious issue.  In practice, the Clean
Water Act has been used as the legislative  ve
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  hicle to restrict any disturbance
of wetlands even though  wetlands are not mentioned in the legislation. The EPA
and Army Corps  of Engineers rely on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to 
regulate landowners that wish to disturb wetland on their  property. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#41">41</A></B></TT>  There are four principal
problems with current wetland policies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> the statutory authority itself is questionable.
Indeed, for  isolated wetland, known as &quot;non-adjacent&quot; wetland,
federal  authority seems clearly lacking. Obviously, federal agencies should not
 pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor any statute  allows them to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the definition of what constitutes a wetland is 
unnecessarily broad. According to the 1987 Delineation Manual now in  force, a
wetland is any land that meets each of the following criteria:  It must be
inundated or saturated to 12 inches deep for at least 7  consecutive days and 5
percent of the growing season, and more  than 50 percent of the dominant plant
species found are found  in marshes and swamps regardless of whether they are
found  elsewhere as well. This language is so unnecessarily inclusive  that land
which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed  a wetland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the nation already has achieved the Bush-Clinton  wetland
goal of &quot;no net loss&quot; in a given year. In recent years, the nation 
has been increasing its wetland stock. In 1994, the likely net gain  was more
than 100,000 acres; the expected loss rate was 102,000  acres, while the
expected &quot;creation&quot; rate due to federal programs  was 195,000 acres.
Additionally, wetland restoration is taking place  on public land and through
strictly private initiatives. In 1994,  for example, Ducks Unlimited alone
restored or enhanced  51,260 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  acres.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the financial resources of many Americans are being 
destroyed as owners are forced to surrender, without  compensation, their right
to use their property. Because many affected  individuals make their living or
pay their mortgages from income  derived from the land, their savings can be
wiped out.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In short, this legislation has led to often absurd results. Based  on
questionable legal authority, federal agencies can force  landowners to
sacrifice their life's savings to protect land with little  ecological value
against the now-obsolete threat of net loss of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pesticides and the Delaney Clause </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the onerous aspects of pesticide regulation is Section  409 of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, known as  the Delaney Clause, enacted in
1958 to ban any additive in  pro-cessed food that has been shown to cause cancer
in humans or  laboratory animals. The Delaney Clause seemed reasonable at the
time  because scientists could test for traces of chemicals only in  quantities
of about one in a million. Today, however, with improvements  in technology,
they can test for many of these chemicals in  quantities of less than one in a
quadrillion (a billion million). Some  chemicals can be detected almost down to
the level of a molecule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This means that extremely small trace quantities that were  undetectable 37
years ago  and thus allowable  now form the  basis for a court order requiring
EPA to eliminate dozens of  pesticides. Many of these same pesticides are
completely safe up to  certain levels, according to EPA's own findings, but the
law requires  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  they be banned. Under Section 408
of the same Act, which  relates to raw foods, EPA has issued regulations setting
the tolerance  level deemed safe for consumption. Thus, under Section 409   the
Delaney Clause  EPA will ban pesticide residues in  processed foods that it
allows and proclaims safe in raw foods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called for a change  in the law: &quot;We
have gotten to a point where we have to say  we know a lot more about these
chemicals than we did 35 years  ago when the law was passed.&quot;  <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#42">42</A></B></TT>  Unfortunately, the 
environmental lobby applied severe pressure on the Clinton Administration,  and
Browner backpedaled from her position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue is not simply cutting costs. Pesticides are responsible  for an
explosion of food production in this country and around  the world while the
land use has remained relatively constant. As  the <a href="envir_4.gif">chart</a> below shows, if
pesticides were eliminated, the amount  of land used for agriculture to produce
the same amount of  food would triple. Moreover, pesticides are directly related
to  lower world food prices. This increases food consumption, including  the
consumption of fruits and vegetables, which in turn lowers  cancer rates. In the
words of Bruce Ames, Professor of Biochemistry  and Molecular Biology at the
University of California at Berkeley  and perhaps the world's foremost expert on
cancer risk, the best  known way to prevent cancer is to &quot;eat your 
veggies.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#43">43</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the fact that some chemical pesticides test positive  for cancer
when huge doses are fed to test animals is not  necessarily cause for alarm.
After all, says Ames, of the 22 chemicals found  in coffee that have been tested
in animal cancer tests, &quot;17 are  carcinogens. There are 10 milligrams of
known carcinogens in a  cup 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  of coffee and that's more
carcinogens than you're likely to  get from pesticide residues in a year....
We're eating natural  pesticides, which are chemicals that plants use to try to
kill off insects that  try to eat them. And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of
them per  day. We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues. So  we're
talking about incredibly tiny amounts of synthetic pesticides,  and yet the same
percentage [roughly half] of natural chemicals  come out positive&quot; when
tested for cancer. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#44">44</A></B></TT>

<P><B>Superfund </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act
(CERCLA), the program for cleaning up  hazardous waste sites, is up for
reauthorization. Superfund, as CERCLA  is known, not only is one of the most
complex laws now in force,  but also is widely regarded as the most wasteful and
ineffective.  Even the Clinton Administration admits the program does not  work.
Despite expenditures of between $20 billion and $30  billion, Superfund has
cleaned up only a small fraction of the  nation's worst hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Superfund was enacted after widespread press attention to the  exposure of
residents to high levels of dangerous chemicals at  Love Canal near Niagara
Falls, New York. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately, the  law was hurried through Congress in the final days of the
Carter  Administration, so many provisions are ill-considered. Much of  the
money has been spent not on cleanup, but on legal fees and  other &quot;transaction
costs,&quot; and while program costs have  ballooned, cleanups have proceeded
slowly. Only 291, or 24 percent, of  the 1,238 &quot;worst&quot; hazardous waste
sites  sites placed on the  National Priorities List (NPL)  have been cleaned
up. To clean up the  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  maining sites now on the NPL will
cost an estimated $40  billion. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#46">46</A></B></TT>  If the cost of cleaning
up federal facilities is added to the  equation, the total could exceed $750
billion, or $7,800 per U.S.  household. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#47">47</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four basic flaws in the Superfund program:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The law as written is designed to reduce the level of 
chemicals in the ground, not to reduce risks to people.</B> Yet fully one-third 
of the sites pose only hypothetical future risks based primarily on  the
assumption that residential housing will be built, thus  exposing future
residents to these chemicals. It is utterly unrealistic to  assume any
residential housing will be built on any  untreated Superfund site; no developer
would attempt it, or get permits if  he did.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. The program's unreasonable standards require that  hazardous waste
sites be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what  the location, resulting
in a poor return on the investment.</B> For  instance, polluted soil at
industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a  level that makes it essentially
clean enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Hazardous wastes by their very nature are local problems,  but
listings, cleanup decisions, and program authority are run by a  federal
bureaucracy.</B> If there is any federal environmental law  for which a
legitimate case can be made for devolving authority  back to the states, it is
CERCLA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. The law's retroactive, strict joint and several liability  scheme
results in endless legal battles as potentially responsible  parties (PRPs)
fight EPA, then each other, and then their insurers to  shoul
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  der the costs of cleanup.</B> It
is little wonder that the program is  derisively called the &quot;Super
scholarship fund for lawyers' children.&quot;   The liability scheme is designed
to find someone with &quot;deep  pockets&quot; to pay the cost of cleanup
regardless of how much  or  how little  that individual may have contributed to
the waste  problem. This forces individuals and small businesses to pay 
enormous sums for what most people would consider innocent acts, some  of them
committed generations ago.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>All of these characteristics drive up costs while blunting  the program's
effectiveness. Moreover, all have led to numerous  horror stories of people
caught in the Superfund liability web.  For instance:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Russ Zimmer was named a PRP for a
Superfund site at a car  battery cracking plant in Torrington, Wyoming. His
contribution  to the problem?  He sold a bag of dog food in 1977 and a bag of 
seed in 1984, and took a third-party check as payment for the  items. Since the
checks had been issued by the now-bankrupt  company that had owned the battery
cracking plant, Zimmer was sued as  a PRP by another company caught in the
Superfund liability  scheme. Zimmer decided, on advice of counsel, that he
should settle  to avoid even more in legal costs. He agreed to pay $3,500  even
though he had nothing to do with the matter.  <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#48">48</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The entire town of Triumph, Idaho, located just
a few miles  away from the famous ski resort town of Sun Valley, has suffered 
terribly under EPA's administration of the Superfund law. The  town, which had a
silver mine until 1957, has plenty of lead in  the ground. So the EPA put the
mine on the Superfund list, with  the highest &quot;worst&quot; Superfund score
ever  almost half again as  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  as the nuclear production site at
Hanford, Washington. As a  result, banks red-lined the town, and homeowners
cannot sell their  homes because banks refuse to lend on them. EPA officials
summoned  an emergency meeting at which they told the 50 families their 
children might have extremely high levels of lead in their blood.  EPA conducted
tests for lead contamination but refused to disclose  the results, so the town
did its own tests. It turns out that lead  poisoning was not a problem because
the well water in Triumph was  not contaminated. In fact, lead levels in
Triumph's water are below  the national average, well within safety limits. Now
the  townspeople are unified against the federal government's treatment of 
their community. In March 1995, a resident, Donna Rose, testified to  a House
Commerce subcommittee that EPA &quot;terrified us. They  committed atrocious
acts on our community.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#49">49</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately for  Triumph, however, the suffering caused under Superfund 
continues. Rose, who like many of her townsfolk believes Triumph was  chosen for
designation as the worst of the worst sites because  EPA needed a trophy as
Superfund came under attack, testified  that &quot;We can't sell our houses.
We're trapped there forever until this  is resolved.&quot; <TT><B><A

</P>
<P><B>CAFE Standards </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  were enacted in
response to the oil crisis in 1973 and were designed  to stabilize oil prices at
lower levels. Today, support for the  program comes primarily from the
environmental lobby, which sees  the standards as a way to preserve fuel, and
perhaps to drive up  the cost of autos. The program currently requires that cars
 average 27.5 mpg (miles per gallon) and that light trucks average  20.7 mpg.
Now the Clinton Administration is considering tightening  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  standards. The problem is that
this law costs both lives and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most serious problem with CAFE standards, to put it  bluntly, is that
they kill people. According to economists Robert  Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of the  Harvard School of Public Health, 1989 model
cars are about 500  pounds lighter than they would have been without the 27.5
mpg  economy standard. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#51">51</A></B></TT>
 They estimate that this weight reduction is  responsible for 2,500 additional
deaths and 25,000 additional serious  injuries per model fleet year. This is too
high a price to pay for any  government program. Raising the standard would only
increase  the death toll. Raising standards to 40 mpg, for example, would 
likely mean another 4,800 to 8,600 deaths per  year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#52">52</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other problem with CAFE, especially with raising the  standard, is that
it makes little economic sense. A study by  Charles Rivers Associates has found
that increasing standards would  raise the average price of cars by $1,500 and
the average price of  trucks by $2,100. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#53">53</A></B></TT>  This would lead
consumers to retain their older  autos longer, thus minimizing the very
decreases in fuel  consumption regulators hope to see and increasing pollution
by an estimated  4 percent by the year 2010 (assuming a 30 percent increase in 
the mileage standard). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#54">54</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Finally, raising CAFE standards would be devastating to  average families.
The reason the traditional full-size family station  wagon no longer is made is
that car manufacturers found it difficult  to meet the 27.5 mpg standard with
these gas-guzzlers in their  fleets. Thus, the market for even less
fuel-efficient minivans  exploded, since they only had to meet the light truck
standard of less than  21 mpg. If standards for light trucks were raised, then 
manufacturers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  would be forced to raise prices
dramatically to cut sales of  the minivan so their fleet average could remain in
compliance.  Thus, most families no longer could afford the only vehicle
designed  for families.

<P>Slowly, methodically, and steadily, the Clinton Administration  has been
pushing a consistently liberal environmental agenda.  The most prominent aspect
of this agenda is its high-flown  rhetoric, especially since the advent of the
104th Congress. While much  of this rhetoric has little to do with reality, the
attack has been  quite effective against a Congress that seems to lack  the
Administration's unified sense of purpose. Vice President Al  Gore, EPA

<P>The Superfund reform advocated by the Administration in  1994 and 1995, for
example, partially addressed some of the most  egregious aspects of this law,
but created perhaps as many problems  as it solved. Thus, the Administration was
able to claim that it  wanted to eliminate some of the worst aspects of the law,
such as joint  and several liability, while attempting to substitute provisions 
that were not much better, such as the allocation scheme it  devised. Meanwhile,
it insisted on seemingly innocuous provisions  that would have created an
environmental welfare program by  diverting up to 4 percent of Superfund's money
to environmental  activists. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#56">56</A></B></TT>

raised so that cars would average 45 mpg (and light trucks  34 mpg) by the year
2007 and 75 mpg and 56 mpg by the year  2025. These recommendations, if
implemented, would have  increased the death toll on the road by many thousands
every year, since  cars meeting these standards necessarily would have to be
lighter to  be more fuel efficient, and thus would be less crashworthy. 
Fortunately, the committee was unable to issue a consensus report  because the

pass any new ones (with the  exception of the California Desert Protection Act).
 Environmental lobbyists worked successfully to block any reauthorization  that
included one or more of three reforms: compensating  property owners for losses
caused by environmental rulings, giving  states relief from unfunded federal
environmental mandates, or  requiring that risk assessments be conducted before
expensive  regulations designed to alleviate some hypothetical risk are put into
place.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Environmentalists so feared passage of these reforms (which  they called the
&quot;unholy trinity&quot;) that they decided it was better to  have no
environmental legislation adopted at all. But conservatives  kept offering the
amendments, which also were supported by  many 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  moderates, so the Democratic
leadership refused to let the  reauthorization bills come up for a vote  even a
bill that would  have raised EPA to Cabinet level as the Department of the 
Environment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the 104th Congress accomplished little more in  the
environmental area during its first session, although it did pass  the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), one part of  the &quot;unholy trinity.&quot;
 While this Act covers regulation generally,  the most burdensome mandates on
local governments typically  have been environmental regulations. For instance,
prior to the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, regulators continued to issue  new
prescriptive regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act  that imposed
enormous costs on local communities by requiring  what some local officials
called gold-plated solutions. After passage  of UMRA, the Senate voted
unanimously for a bill that would  allow smaller communities to develop and use
less costly  alternative standards on condition that they protect the public 
health. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While property-rights and risk-assessment bills have been  debated
thoroughly by both chambers and passed by the House, the  Senate has yet to vote
on them, and President Clinton has threatened  to veto them if they reach his
desk. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#61">61</A></B></TT> 
Congress also has failed  to reauthorize the major environmental laws. The
reason: Few  reforms of the current laws could avoid a veto by the President, 
and the leadership does not have the votes to override a veto.  Moreover, as of
publication, Members so far have failed to embrace  an environmental vision of
their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As of publication, EPA appropriations for FY 1996 have not  become law.
Congress passed the EPA appropriations bill as part  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  the Veterans Affairs, Housing and
Urban Development, and  Independent Agencies appropriations bill on December 14,
1995,  but President Clinton vetoed the bill four days later. His main 
objection was that EPA's funding level of $5.7 billion was too low,  especially
in the enforcement area. While EPA's funding under  the bill would have been
reduced by 21 percent as a necessary  incident to balancing the budget, it is
unlikely this would interfere  seriously with EPA's mandate. Although no new
major environmental  laws have passed  and only one has been amended since  1989
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#62">62</A></B></TT>  the level of
funding that Clinton vetoed as too deep a cut is almost  10 percent higher than
when President Bush took  office. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#63">63</A></B></TT>  In reality, EPA's growth
has far outstripped growth of both the economy  and the federal government; the
funding of $5.7 billion merely  reflects an attempt to rectify this imbalance.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Emphasize research on climate change rather than costly, 
questionable controls. </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the science of climate change were more precise than it is,  and the
evidence more consistent with the dire predictions of  some proponents of the
global-warming theory, it could make sense  for the United States and other
countries to take urgent,  expensive action to deal with the potential threat.
But the science is far  from certain. Rather than rush to &quot;do something&quot;
at huge cost, the  wiser and more mature course would be to try to find out more
 precisely what actually is happening to the Earth's atmosphere. Yet 
environmentalists are trying to redirect funding from research on  climate
change to research on its effects  on the assumption that  global warming
definitely will happen. As noted by Jeffrey Salmon,  Ex
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  ecutive Director of the George C.
Marshall Institute, which  focuses on science issues, &quot;obviously, the
environmental lobby has  not been happy with the data that science has been
coming up with  the last few years.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#65">65</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should resist attempts to redirect climate change  research. While
cutting unnecessary duplication of research  may allow for some budget savings,
the basic research should  continue as insurance against unwise actions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Change the Endangered Species Act to give landowners the  incentive to
conserve species.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>ESA should be reformed to eliminate the adversarial  relationship between
landowners and species fostered by the current Act.  If landowners, who are
closest to the species needing protection,  had an incentive to provide habitat
or encourage reproduction on  their property, there is little doubt these
species would flourish. Just  as the country pays auto makers to produce Jeeps
for the Army,  it should pay landowners to produce members of endangered 
species that need protection. Not only would this reform allow the Act  to work
for the first time, but Americans also would not be forced  to surrender their
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform America's wetlands &quot;legislation.&quot;
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is time to decide whether wetlands should be protected for  their own
sake. If the answer is &quot;No,&quot; the Clean Water Act  reauthorization
should specify that protection is limited to water pollution.  If the answer is
&quot;Yes,&quot; a Wetlands Protection Act should be passed.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require the government to pay fair market value if it  confiscates
property through regulation.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The executive branch should be required to define different  categories of
wetlands according to ecological structure and  value. Additionally, it should
establish differing levels of protection.  This categorization should include
the economic value of the land as  a component of the decision-making process so
that decisions  to regulate take into account the relative cost of protecting
each  parcel. By including this factor, the money spent on acquiring  wetlands
would be stretched to obtain the maximum protection  for every dollar spent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Repeal the Delaney Clause.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending billions of dollars to ban useful, safe pesticides to  avoid
negligible risks is simply bad public policy. The Delaney Clause  is obsolete
and should be discarded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform Superfund.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Superfund is broken. If it is to be repaired, it must be  completely
overhauled. Federal agencies, state governments,  municipalities, and the
private sector must be relieved of the ill-conceived,  unnecessary, and
expensive burdens of this program. Specifically,  the reformed CERCLA should at
least:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Turn</B> authority for current NPL sites over to the
states  with  the necessary funding. To qualify for funds, states should be 
required to meet two conditions:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>      <B>1.</B> That they prioritize sites and expenditures based on real 
risks, and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>      <B>2.</B> That they eliminate joint and several liability and end 
retroactive liability for wastes disposed of before 1987 for sites  cleaned with
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Allow</B> states to use funds for any of their most
serious  hazardous waste sites, not just NPL sites transferred from the federal 
government. These conditions would have to apply, or states would  be tempted
simply to spend the money on sites for which they  were responsible rather than
on those that are most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Create</B> a revolving loan fund for cleaning up old
industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Allow</B> EPA to retain its emergency cleanup 
capacity. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#66">66</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If substantive reforms of this nature are not enacted,  Superfund will
continue to be an ineffective and expensive drain on  the American economy. But
if proper reforms are instituted,  Congress can achieve its original goal of
protecting Americans from  hazardous wastes at reasonable cost.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Save lives by ending the CAFE program.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Not only should CAFE standards not be raised further, but the  program
should be eliminated. It costs lives and jobs and  provides only questionable
benefits. Reducing oil consumption may  help lower oil prices and reduce
pollution, but it also costs 2,500  lives. The trade-off simply is not worth it.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't regulatory reform mean rolling back regulations  that protect
our environment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Regulatory reform means introducing common sense  into the
equation when decisions are made about whether, for  instance, a chemical should
be banned or regulated. At its most basic,  regulatory reform means making sure
the government knows what it  is doing before it does it by requiring agencies
to analyze  realistically the risks and compare the costs and benefits of their
actions.  It means making sure the process is open to scrutiny by making  it &quot;transparent&quot;
so that shoddy procedures or wildly unrealistic  assumptions used in risk
analysis, and thus in making decisions,  do not go unchallenged. Also, by
requiring these agencies to  estimate the likely risks  not just the most
extreme conceivable risks   the country can have a better idea of what it is
buying with its  scarce economic resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Currently, federal agencies typically use only worst-case  assumptions
multiplied by other worst-case assumptions. The likely  risk of chemicals, for
example, is multiplied millions of times.  Thus, the risk is artificially
inflated to seem unacceptable. By that  mathematical logic, leaving your house
in the suburbs to pick up a  carton of milk from a convenience store would be
deemed an  unjustifiable risk because of your chance of dying from a falling 
airplane. Without accurate risk assessments, federal agencies such as  EPA
promulgate costly regulations which yield few or no benefits,  and many of which
probably would not be seen as desirable if  the agency were adequately
self-informed about the likely risks  and benefits of its actions.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the federal government compensate property  owners for the
loss of property rights? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There are plenty of good reasons. For one, the Fifth  Amendment
states, &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public  use, without just
compensation.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Supreme  Court has interpreted this to
apply primarily only when the  government physically takes your land.
Bureaucrats exploit this legal fine  print by allowing people to retain title to
their property  and pay  taxes on it  even as they take away the owner's right
to decide how  his property should be used. Nor are property owners reimbursed 
for their losses. This is both unfair and economically devastating.  For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife spend a large portion  of their
retirement savings to buy property on which to build  their dream home and that
property then is designated a &quot;wetland,&quot;  the value of their property 
and their savings  is destroyed.  Unfortunately, tales of financial hardship
caused by government  designation of land as wetland or endangered-species
habitat have  become common. This is unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the public benefits, then the public  not some hapless  landowner  should
pay to provide that benefit. Thus, if the  government takes away your right to
determine for yourself how to  use your $100,000 property, it should compensate
you for the loss  in value it created by taking away that right. The fundamental
 question is whether they took away your right to use your  property; how much
they should pay is merely a function of how much  that right was worth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives often fight regulations that encourage  energy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  conservation. Why? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives are not against conserving energy when it  makes
sense to do so, but responsible adults who must weigh the pros  and cons of
their actions  and who must pay for the energy  are  the best judges of when it
makes sense to conserve or expend  energy in their daily lives. The fact is that
federally mandated energy  conservation is costly in terms of money, human
suffering, and  increased deaths, and sometimes is even counterproductive. For 
instance, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  are now supported
primarily by the Clinton Administration and  environmentalists as a way to
preserve fuel. The most serious  problem with CAFE standards is that the weight
reductions necessary  to meet them make cars less safe because lighter cars are
less  crashworthy. In fact, about 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000  additional
serious injuries occur per model year. Although raising  the standard would
raise the death toll even more, that is exactly  what Clinton wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Energy conservation mandates also cause other unintended  consequences.
Increasing CAFE standards would raise the average  price of cars by as much as
$1,500. And with higher priced autos,  many people would keep their autos on the
road longer, thus  minimizing the very decreases in fuel consumption regulators
are hoping  to achieve. On top of that, older autos kept on the road longer 
would mean increased pollution, not lower pollution. Saving some  oil hardly
justifies the death and suffering imposed by  ill-considered command-and-control
federal regulations such as CAFE.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't cutting EPA's funding just a backdoor attempt by  conservatives
to gut the enforcement of environmental laws they  don't 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  like? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> A.</B> No. The simple truth is that our country cannot afford  ever
more expensive government if we are to eliminate the budget  deficit that
threatens the economic future of our children.  Balancing the budget requires
tough choices, and all federal agencies   even the IRS  will be forced to
streamline their operations.  EPA should not be an exception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The administration of environmental laws will not be affected  adversely by
the budget. EPA still will have a bigger budget than  it had when President Bush
took office, so charges of gutting  EPA's ability to enforce the law are
specious. The fact is that EPA,  instead of concentrating on how we can protect
our  environment under the law, has pushed for ever more paperwork and  control
over the private sector. It uses these new costly programs to  justify its
requests for ever greater funding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What these cuts do is require EPA, just like any business  in America, to
evaluate its procedures to cut the fat from its  programs while simultaneously
improving the environment. For  instance, EPA currently does an expensive but
very poor job of  sporadically monitoring factory air and water emissions. It
should allow  companies to hire independent certified contractors to certify
that  they have met certain compliance requirements, much as  accountants
certify tax law compliance. With EPA maintaining a  spot-checking function,
independent contractors would be motivated to  provide honest reports, and &quot;cheating&quot;
and pollution would likely be  reduced considerably. The government also would
save  enormous sums.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives talk about reducing costs and saving jobs,  but what
about saving lives by controlling toxic chemicals? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> How many dollars or jobs is a child's life worth?  Who can  put a
price tag on human life?  These are impossible questions,  but they are not
really the issue. The issue is how to structure our  laws so that we get the
highest quality of life, which includes a long  and healthy life, but at
reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Reducing costs and saving jobs actually saves far more lives  than many
federal &quot;risk reduction&quot; regulations. Money wasted on  ineffective
programs is not available for more beneficial  purposes, including saving more
lives. Recent studies have made this  point crystal clear. Scholars have
recently discovered that, for every  year of life extended, the average cost for
federal toxin regulations   the kind for which EPA is renowned  is $2.8 million;
by  contrast, the average cost for medical treatments is $19,000, and the 
average cost for injury reduction efforts is $48,000. Thus, the average  toxin
control program costs roughly 58 times more for every year of  life extended
than the average injury prevention program and  146 times more than the average
medical program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The question thus is not whether $2.8 million is too little or  too great.
The question is whether we want to save the most lives  possible with our
economic resources or squander those scarce  resources in an attempt to
eliminate what are often hypothetical  risks while ignoring that real people
still will die from some other  cause. If lawmakers seriously considered which
environmental  policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many
costly  rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more 
lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  regulation that are radically
different from those that  burden America today. In many cases, if the private
resources used  to comply with federal mandates simply were left in the 
industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy,  Americans
would benefit far more  and far more lives could be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Experts and governments from all over the world have  concluded in
the last year or so   that industrial activity adds to  global warming. When
will conservatives take their heads out of the  sand and admit it?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Actually, scientists and experts all over the world have  been
coming to a very different conclusion. Fears of global  warming have been
reduced as knowledge has increased, and the dire  predictions of global warming
are beginning to resemble the dire  predictions of the coming Ice Age  also
supposedly man-caused   that was supposed to turn the planet into a frozen
wasteland.  President Bush jump-started serious scientific research on  climate
change a few years ago, increasing the annual budget 25  percent annually. The
results of these billions of dollars are that we  have consistently  vastly 
overstated the risk. Now that we are  armed with much more information, it is
clear the models predicting  global warming were fatally flawed and biased to
show  warming when in reality the planet is cooling. The truth is that despite 
the hysterical language often associated with this issue, we know  the planet
has not warmed at all since we started keeping highly  accurate satellite data
in the late 1970s. Yet environmentalists  now claim even the blizzard of '96 is
an example of global  warming. While it might be nice to dismiss the climate
change theory  altogether since environmentalists are so inconsistent about 
whether the temperature will soar or plummet  although it will be  man's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  fault either way  this would be
unwise. The wise thing to  do would be to continue funding so that we know what
is really  happening. What gives the environmentalists away is that many  of
them are now calling for elimination of research on whether  and how climate
change is occurring in favor of research on what  effects global warming will
have, based on the assumption it  will happen.

<P>American labor law is largely a product of the conditions and  perspectives
of the 1930s. It needs to be reformed. Today's  economy, labor market, and
labor-management relations are very  different from the time when most of
America's major labor laws  were passed. Instead of modernizing labor law in
recent years,  however, the federal government has continued to place more 
regulations, mandates, and taxes on employers and workers. The result:  fewer
job opportunities and slower real wage growth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 25 years, the United States has moved from a  manufacturing to
a global service economy, competition has  increased, and more American women
are working than ever before.  Workers are demanding more flexible hours,
working conditions,  compensation packages, and workplace involvement than
current laws  and regulations allow. Employers are straining under 
unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Reform of America's labor laws is long overdue. The  primary objectives of
this reform should be to:

<P>In 1992 the main issue was the economy. Specifically, it was  the jobless
recovery that resulted from President Bush's tax and  regulatory increases.
Although job security continues to concern  many workers, since the end of the
recession the resilient  American economy has created over 8 million jobs and
the major labor  issues have shifted to wage growth and income inequality. The 
idea that workers are falling down the economic ladder and no  longer can afford
to raise families has become conventional wisdom.  The debate also has developed
a disturbing class warfare tone  that clouds the issue and unnecessarily
polarizes Americans.

solution is not higher  taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the
minimum  wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and  reforms
that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities  for Americans
through such things as improving basic education  and encouraging more

current workplace policies and regulations are well  intentioned, their benefits

additional workers.

<P><B>Rising Living Standards Despite Higher Taxes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A decline in average real cash wages since 1973 falsely suggests  a decrease
in the American standard of living. Some politicians  are using this narrow
definition of economic well-being to promote  the failed redistribution and
regulatory policies of big  government. Most workers are better off today
because their real  compensation and real per capita income continue to
increase. Real  compensation is a more accurate measure of the &quot;pay&quot;
American  workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and 
pension payments, as well as cash. The reason for this is that  workers are
taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free  benefits than ever
before. Employee benefits accounted for 41.3 percent  of payroll costs in 1993,
up from almost 18.7 percent in 1951  and 36.6 percent in 1979.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#16">16</A>  Stagnating cash wages are a
concern,  but government should be focusing on policies that increase 
productivity and economic growth to raise take-home pay instead of  imposing
mandates, taxes, and regulations that limit employment  opportunities and wages.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     After growing from 1948 to 1973, the average real hourly 
wage (that is, adjusted for inflation) has declined 10.1  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#17">17</A>  This decline, however, has not
occurred in all industries. Real  average hourly earnings in the service,
finance, insurance, and real  estate industries have increased 1.6 percent and
6.7 percent since 1973.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->

<P>
</P>
<P>-     From 1978 to 1994, average annual pay adjusted for inflation 
increased 1.0 percent.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#18">18</A>  This
long-run increase, however, hides  significant growth differences in the
intervening years and  between states. For example, average annual pay decreased
3.0  percent from 1978 to 1980, then increased 5.9 percent from 1980 to  1988,
and then declined 1.7 percent from 1988 to  1994.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#19">19</A>  Further, since 1988 average
annual pay has increased in 13 states and the  District of Columbia and declined
in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As noted, hourly wages do not account for the increasing  frequency with
which employees receive their &quot;pay&quot; in the form  of untaxed fringe
benefits. Further, hourly wage data are limited  in the types of employees they
cover (68 percent of all  payroll jobs).<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#20">20</A>
 Compensation  or wages plus benefits  is a more  complete measure of the pay
American workers receive. Real  compensation, by any measure, continues to
increase. 
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     From 1950 to 1973, real hourly compensation increased an 
average of 3.2 percent per year.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#21">21</A>
 Since 1973, real hourly  compensation has increased an average of 0.4 percent
per year. The  problem is not that the average wage has declined, but that total
&quot;pay&quot;  has grown more slowly since 1973. This can be attributed to the
 slowdown in the growth of productivity, resulting in part from  the growth of
government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes   all of which reduce the net
value of a worker's output, leading to  a slowdown of wages.

reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The  comparison of average

<P><B>The Folly of Increasing the Minimum Wage</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Bill Clinton urged Congress in 1995 to pass  legislation to raise
the hourly minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 over  two years. Although the
President and other proponents of an  increase argue that a higher minimum wage
is needed to achieve &quot;a  minimum decent living wage&quot; for working
Americans, a  minimum wage hike in fact will destroy entry-level job 
opportunities<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#35">35</A> for the very
unskilled Americans proponents claim to be helping.  Further, it will do nothing
to increase the income of nonworking  families, while raising prices for both
the poor and non-poor. Instead  of considering a minimum wage hike, Congress
should focus on  tax and regulatory reforms to increase take-home pay and reduce
 the cost of creating jobs. Doing that will promote economic  growth with low
inflation, and increase employment opportunities  and wages for all Americans.<A

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Raising the minimum wage generally does not help 
low-income households.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#37">37</A>  The

<P>-     Employers' response to an increase in the minimum wage  will harm
workers.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#39">39</A>  Forced to pay higher
wages when  productivity has not increased, employers tend to reduce the rate of
new  hiring and postpone the replacement of employees who quit. They  will tend
to reduce hours (particularly for unskilled workers) or  replace lower-skilled
workers with higher-skilled workers as  low-skilled workers quit. They also may
consider reducing or eliminating  pay raises and bonuses for their other
employees.

<P>
</P>
<P>Increasing the minimum wage to $5.15 would result in a loss  of around
400,000 entry-level jobs.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#40">40</A> 
Depending on the  overall economy, total employment may increase, but there will
be  fewer unskilled job opportunities available for Americans than there

declined by 45 percent.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#42">42</A>  This is

Although well intentioned, even  unpaid leave can hurt workers in ways that are

debarment from bidding on future  contracts. The $100,000 annual threshold<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#50">50</A> effectively extends  coverage to
contractors receiving 90 percent of federal contracts  and will raise the cost
of federal contracts as these employers  are forced to take into account the
potential cost of settling labor  disputes. The Employment Policy Foundation
estimates the  annual economic cost of implementing the order at between $520 
million and $2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#51">51</A> 
Further, the order increases the likelihood  of strike activity at federal
contractors, hurting both union  workers and employers through lost wages and
output, and may  discourage unionized employers from even bidding on federal
contracts.  By increasing the incentive for businesses to set up nonunion 
subsidiaries and encouraging the use of nonunion subcontractors, it  ultimately
hurts union workers' income and job opportunities.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Job Training.</B> Both the Senate and the House passed
legislation  to consolidate over 70 of the 163 federal job training programs 
into state block grants and reduce overall spending by almost 20  percent. The
legislation gave states the flexibility to design  unified employment,
education, and economic development programs  that meet the needs of their
workers. It also significantly improved  federal and state performance
accountability. The Senate and  House versions of the legislation are

million workers. The bills  would allow workers and employers to reach voluntary
agreements  concerning flexible work schedules and pay. For example, a  mother
would be able to work 45 hours one week in exchange for  working 35 hours the
next week so that she could have time to take  her child to the doctor.
Currently, the FLSA bars employers from  providing this flexibility, even to
salaried workers, by requiring  the payment of overtime and prohibiting the
shifting of hours  from one week to the next.<A

<P><B>Workplace Health and Safety.</B> A number of bills were  introduced in
the House and Senate to reform workplace safety and  health programs. The
leading House bill is H.R. 1834, introduced  by Representative Cass Ballenger
(R-NC). In the Senate, the  leading bill is S. 526, introduced by Senator Judd
Gregg (R-NH). Of  these two bills, H.R. 1834 represents the more comprehensive 
OSHA reform. It would focus more of OSHA's resources on  compliance assistance
instead of enforcement, give employers a  reasonable time to fix hazards before
a penalty is issued, and restore  common sense and sound science to the way OSHA
writes its standards.  It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative
overhead  and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA. S. 526 
essentially proposes to codify many of OSHA's reinvention  initiatives.
Although, the Senate Labor Committee has reported out  S. 526, the House has not

<P><B>Davis-Bacon.</B> Both the Senate and the House have introduced  bills to
repeal the Davis Bacon Act. Davis-Bacon was enacted  during the Depression
explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion  workers  chiefly blacks and
Hispanics  from competing for  federally funded construction jobs. Unfortunately
for these workers, it  has succeeded. This Depression-era law promotes racial 
discrimination in the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions
 of dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special  interests.
Moreover, states are beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted
data that inflate U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#60">60</A>  The Senate Labor Committee

<P><B>Collective Bargaining.</B> Both the Senate and the House also  have
introduced bills to reform the National Labor Relations Act.  The House-passed
Teamwork for Employees and  Management (TEAM) Act would enable businesses to
establish  employer-employee involvement committees as a way to give workers a 
voice in business operations to help improve productivity, safety,  and customer
service. Currently, the only discussions of  workplace issues between employers
and workers that are clearly legal  are those that occur during traditional
collective bargaining;  businesses that establish employee-employer committees
risk  litigation and significant legal costs. The Senate is expected to vote on 
its version of the TEAM Act in 1996.

<P>The National Right-to-Work Act (S. 581 and H.R. 1279) seeks  to preserve and

this bill are planned for  1996, and the bill faces strong opposition from
organized labor.

<P><B>ERISA.</B> The Employee Retirement and Income Security  Act (ERISA) was
enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in  employee pension and welfare plans<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#61">61</A> that provide workers with 
retirement benefits promised by their employers. Reform legislation in  the
104th Congress has focused on the regulation of health  insurance benefits. In
the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL)  introduced a bill (H.R. 995)
which would provide for health  insurance portability between jobs, increased
participation, and other  consumer protections for workers. In the Senate, Nancy
 Kassebaum (R-KS) has introduced S. 1028, which incorporates sections  of H.R.
995 dealing with increasing access to health care  benefits, providing for
greater portability of health insurance between  jobs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  increasing the security of health
care benefits for workers,  and increasing the purchasing power of individuals
and small  employers. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee in 
October 1995. It is highly likely that health insurance reform will  be enacted
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions also were  introduced in
Congress. The most comprehensive (H.R. 2037 and  S. 1006), introduced by
Representative Rob Portman (R-OH)  and Senator David Pryor (D-AR), would
simplify pension  provision and distribution rules and improve access to pension
plans  for small employers. It is highly likely this pension law reform will  be
enacted by the 104th Congress in 1996.

<P><B>Labor Department Reforms.</B> Congress also used the budget  process
last year as a vehicle for reform. The House voted to reduce  FY 1996 DoL
discretionary spending by 13.8 percent and  instituted several important
reforms. Among these, the House budget  prohibits the issuance of two
unnecessarily burdensome OSHA  regulations on ergonomics and fall protection,
and bars DoL from  promoting &quot;economically targeted investments&quot; by
private  pension plans.  Both the Senate and House most likely will pass a 
continuing resolution that will fund DoL for the remainder of FY  1996 with a 15
percent spending cut from FY 1995.

<P>The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression  explicitly to prevent
low-skilled nonunion workers  chiefly blacks  and Hispanics  from competing for
federally funded  construction jobs.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#68">68</A>
 This Depression-era law contributes to racial  discrimination in the
construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers  billions of dollars a year,
stifles productivity, and subsidizes  special interests. Moreover, states are
beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted data that inflate
U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations and drive up the cost of federally
funded  construction projects.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#69">69</A> 
If Davis-Bacon were not already law, it  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  never be passed today. Proponents
would be denounced as  supporting discrimination; it would be pointed out that
the  bill's worker protection provisions are unnecessary because they exist  in
other statutes; and lawmakers would object to the heavy,  unnecessary budget
costs imposed by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost  of federal
service contracts by as much as $500 million per year  and, like Davis-Bacon,
creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled  entry-level workers, who tend to
be poor and minorities. DoL  has long been criticized for the way it operates
under this law.  Despite two amendments,<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#70">70</A>
the SCA continues to suffer from  statutory ambiguity, administrative problems,
arbitrary requirements,  and capricious enforcement.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#71">71</A>  The General Accounting Office 
has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's &quot;inability  to
administer the act efficiently and effectively&quot; and because &quot;it  is
impractical, in our opinion, to make `prevailing wage'  determinations under the
act in a consistently equitable  manner.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#72">72</A>  Outdated by extension of the Fair
Labor Standards Act to service  workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and
costly bureaucratic  burden that should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to  offer
flexible schedule and compensation options.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect  unskilled,
low-pay workers. But in today's economy, where  both parents are likely to be
working, its rigid and inflexible  provisions hurt more than they help. The FLSA
deprives workers of the  right to order their daily lives, both on and off the
job, to meet the  responsibilities of work and home. For example, a worker  who

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  wants to work 35 hours one week
in exchange for working  45 hours the following week to attend a child's
parent-teacher  conference must forgo five hours of pay or else have an employer
 willing to pay overtime for working more than 40 hours the second  week.
Congress should extend the same freedom to private workers  that federal
employees have  flextime  and allow employers to  offer flexible schedule and
compensation options to their  workers.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#73">73
</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act to remove union special  privileges.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Norris-LaGuardia Act (NLA), passed in 1932, exempts  unions from the
Sherman Antitrust Act, makes union-free  employment contracts unenforceable in
federal courts, and prohibits  federal judges from issuing injunctions to
interrupt violent strikes.  The NLA is special privilege legislation for
organized labor and  should be repealed.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#74">74</A>
 If there are to be antitrust laws, they ought to  apply equally to all
combinations in restraint of trade, whether by  employers or by workers. The
right of workers and employers to  enter voluntarily into union-free contracts
should not be abridged,  and workers and employers should be able to petition
the courts to  stop union-related violence. While there is room in a free
society  for voluntary unionism, there is no room for the special  privileges
granted unions under the NLA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions  on the
ability of employers to create employee involvement  structures and to protect
the free choice of individual workers to form  and join unions, or to refrain
from such activities.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Employer-employee involvement (EI) committees are a way  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  give workers a voice in business
operations to help improve  productivity, safety, and customer service. Under
current law,  however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly
 legal between employers and employees are those that occur in  traditional
collective bargaining arrangements. In practice,  employers can listen to their
nonunion employees but cannot respond to  their views without risking litigation
and significant legal costs.  The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management 
Relations<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#75">75</A> has recommended &quot;removing
the legal  uncertainties&quot;<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#76">76</A>
on the EI committees that take a broader, more systemic approach to 
participation that the evidence suggests has the greatest long-term  positive
effects on economic performance. Congress should reform  the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA) to exempt EI  committees formed to address issues of
quality, productivity, safety, and  customer service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Section 7 of the NLRA limits the right of workers to refrain  from union
activities if there is a collective bargaining agreement  that requires union
membership as a condition of employment.  Forcing a worker to join or pay dues
to an unwanted union amounts to  deprivation of the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of  association. According to the NLRA, a worker has full freedom of 
rights except when compulsory unionism enters the picture. The  exception clause
in Section 7 should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Ban the diversion of union dues for political or ideological  purposes
to which employees object.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that unions, as  exclusive bargaining
agents, may not use proceeds from dues to pursue  political or ideological goals
over the objections of affected  employ
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  ees. The proceeds from those
employees, said the Court, are to  be used strictly for collective bargaining
and contract  administration, including grievance adjustment.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#77">77
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dues are mandatory even for employees who are not members  of the union but
who may be required, under the NLRA principle  of exclusive representation, to
support it. Federal legislation  is needed to require the written authorization
of workers for  unions to use dues or dues equivalents for political purposes.
Such  legislation should place the burden on unions to prove that no funds  are
being diverted without written consent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Take action to boost productivity, thereby increasing  compensation.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to the practitioners of class warfare, employers do not   indeed,
cannot  unfairly keep down the wages of their  lower-skilled and entry-level
employees. Employers, as well as  employees, operate within a competitive labor
market in which wage  rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers  
<I>less </I>the costs of government-imposed mandates and taxes associated with
employing  a worker. The more productive a worker is, the more that  worker will
be paid. Congress should focus on policies that will  increase wages and job
opportunities for Americans by improving  labor productivity and reducing the
cost of employing workers.  Specifically, Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Balance the budget.</B> This will increase total domestic
saving,  lower interest rates, and increase investment. The growth in capital 
per worker is closely associated over time with the growth in  labor
productivity.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut the capital gains tax.</B> This will increase investment in the 
U.S. and provide an incentive for both American and foreign firms  to put their
capital to work here with American workers. A  capital gains tax cut also will
make more venture capital available  for emerging technologies and for research
and development that  will improve future productivity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increase the skills of the workforce.</B> What is needed is  fundamental
change aimed at improving basic education through  school choice, strengthening
core curricula, and enabling local  educators to improve discipline and set high
expectations. Congress  also should consider tax-deferred or tax-free education
savings  accounts similar to individual retirement accounts, or enabling  states
and individuals to use lump sum unemployment insurance  benefits for education
and training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enact significant regulatory reform.</B> The explosion of new 
regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital,  created
barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs, and  raised the cost of
employing Americans. This higher cost of  employment in turn means that in a
competitive economy, the return to labor  in the form of wages is reduced. The
regulatory burden needs to  be rolled back, not only to allow wages to rise, but
also to  decrease the cost of hiring workers.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The White House also should take action. Specifically, the  President
should:
</P>
<P><B>Rescind the striker replacement executive order. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Executive Order 12954, signed by President Clinton in  March 1995, was an
attempt to bypass Congress and establish new  labor 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  policy by executive fiat: a gift
to a constituency that could not  get its way through the legislative process.
The order will drive up  the cost of federal contracts and hurt workers. The
$100,000  annual threshold effectively extends coverage to contractors receiving
 90 percent of federal contracts and will raise the cost of federal  contracts
as employers take into account the potential cost of  settling labor disputes.
The economic cost of implementing the order  will be between $520 million and $2
billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#78">78</A>  Further, the order 
will increase the likelihood of strike activity that hurts both  union workers
and employers through lost wages and output, and  may even discourage unionized
employers from bidding on federal  contracts in the future. It also will
increase the incentive for  businesses to set up nonunion subsidiaries and
encourage the use of  nonunion subcontractors  both of which ultimately hurt
union workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia unanimously
set aside President Clinton's striker replacement  executive order,<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#79">79</A> the President has instructed the
Justice  Department to take all appropriate steps to have the decision
overturned.  The President should not waste Justice Department resources on 
this appeal and should rescind E.O. 12954.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should the government do to create and keep jobs in  this
country?  What do you say to the millions of Americans  looking for work?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  Outdated labor laws, mandates, and heavy taxes lock  workers out
of jobs the private sector otherwise would create.  Congress needs to balance
the budget, cut taxes, and eliminate  unnecessarily 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  burdensome regulations. This will
improve economic growth,  create more job opportunities, and increase the
take-home pay  of American workers. Government mandates and wasteful rules  are
strangling job creation, making employers think twice before  hiring additional
workers. Americans want jobs, and employers  want to hire them. Red tape and
taxes get in the way.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Compared with the 1980s, the burden of higher taxes and  more regulations
has limited job growth significantly. Since the  1990 and 1993 tax increases,
manufacturing jobs have declined by  6.0 percent. We need to reduce government
spending, cut taxes  for American families, and reduce the capital gains tax to 
increase investment, productivity, wages, and jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support cutting taxes and regulations on big  business
when wages are falling, corporate profits are up, and  executive pay is
excessive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A. </B>The problem is not that profits are too high; profits are  needed
to invest in new ventures which create jobs and raise  productivity  and wages.
The problem is that taxes, mandates, and  regulations are keeping workers' pay
too low. Cutting individual taxes  will increase the take-home pay of working
Americans. If you look  at your paycheck, you'll see that the real culprit is
the  government, not your employer. Cutting taxes boosts take-home pay  without
cutting job opportunities. For instance, Congress's  $500-per-child tax credit
would put $22 billion per year back into family  budgets so that working parents
can provide for their children in a way  no government program can. The other
key to higher wages is  productivity. Lowering the capital gains tax will
increase  investment, improve productivity, and increase wages. Balancing the 
budget 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  and cutting taxes will help poor
and middle-class Americans  more than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The minimum wage is too low. You can't make ends meet  unless you
work two jobs; what's the harm in raising the  minimum wage?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  It's a job killer and will hurt the very people it is suppose 
to help. The reason: Telling an employer that he or she must  pay higher wages
to low-skilled, entry-level workers simply means  the employer will hire fewer
such workers. Minimum wage laws  presume that politicians are morally justified
in destroying  some people's jobs and their opportunity to begin living the 
American dream in order to inflate other people's wages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't allowing companies to use replacement workers  during strikes
just a ploy to break unions?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is striker replacement law that ultimately hurts union 
workers and drives up the cost of federal contracts. Outlawing  replacement
workers will simply increase the incentive for businesses to set  up nonunion
companies and encourage the use of nonunion  subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Most conservatives said that NAFTA would be a good thing  for U.S.
workers. What do you say now to those Americans who  have lost their jobs to
cheap Mexican labor?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Policies that cause the economy to change and grow  always mean
some jobs are lost while many new ones are created.  Some jobs indeed have been
lost because of NAFTA, but many  more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  have been created. NAFTA is good
for American workers  because free trade creates jobs, increases wealth, and
offers  consumers more and better goods at lower prices. It is protectionism
that  ultimately destroys jobs, reduces wealth, and limits consumer  choice.
Free trade may lead to the demise of some businesses and jobs,  but so does
local competition. What is most important is that free  trade fosters higher
productivity, and higher productivity  generates higher wages, more wealth, and
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't curbing OSHA mean more worker injuries and deaths?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Everyone wants better workplace safety and health. The issue  is
how you get there. A new approach is required to improve the  incentives for
workplace health and safety. The role of the  federal government needs to be
changed from that of heavy-handed  regulator to that of cooperative partner.
Today's army of OSHA  inspectors focuses on fines and penalties. That does not
mean  work. Instead, the government should work cooperatively with  businesses
and employees to improve workplace safety. OSHA's  own Maine 200 program has
proven that emphasizing compliance  assistance over enforcement can improve
workplace safety  and health dramatically. If we take this course, Americans
will  get more workplace health and safety for their tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't somebody who has worked all his life and is  suddenly laid
off deserve help with some job training?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes. The problem is that today's federal job training  programs
are ineffective. The 104th Congress is working on legislation  that consolidates
over 70 of the 163 federal job training programs  scattered across 15 agencies
into state block  grants.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#80">80</A>  This
will help, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  because states will have the
flexibility to design unified  employment, education, and economic development
programs that  meet the job training needs of their workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to close down the Department  of Labor? 
Who will protect workers' interests in Washington?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American labor law is largely a product of the conditions  and
perspectives of the 1930s and needs to be reformed.  Today's economy, labor
market conditions, and labor-management  relations differ significantly from
those that existed when most  of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers
are  demanding more flexible hours, pay, and working conditions than current 
laws and regulations allow. Employers are straining under  unnecessarily
burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes.  American labor laws
should be reformed to empower workers to  protect themselves. The problem is
that the whole philosophy and  organization of the Department of Labor is
steeped in the 1930s and  resists modernization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives are not calling for the elimination of  everything DoL does.
Instead, they are calling for functions to be carried  out elsewhere. Some of
DoL's key national functions, like  workplace health and safety, would remain at
the federal level. Other  functions that are not national in scope should be
turned over to  the states, or in some cases to the private sector where they
can be  run more effectively. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful 
bureaucracies, however, should be closed.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are increasingly anxious about the breakdown of the basic social
institutions of society.  Nowhere is this more visible than in the breakdown and
disappearance of neighborhoods. Many once-friendly  and peaceful neighborhoods
are now threatening and dangerous. Particularly alarming is the breakdown  of
marriage and the family. Marriage and the stable two-parent family form the
centerbeam of society,  but soaring rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock births
are destroying this crucial institution and weakening  the development of the
next generation. This means more welfare dependence, more crime, more health 
and behavioral problems, lower educational achievement, and the prospect of
daunting obstacles in later life  for millions of young Americans. Some 92
percent of children on welfare today are from broken  families. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm">1</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To a significant extent, government programs and policies have contributed
to this collapse. The  incentives within welfare programs over the last 30 years
have discouraged two-parent families among the poor.  These programs also have
discouraged work and responsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Families also have come under assault from the tax system. Today the federal
income tax takes  one-fourth of the income of the average married family with
children  and state and local taxes increase the  total government take to 38
percent. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm">2</A></B></TT>  This
compares with just two percent in federal taxes paid by a  similar family just
after World War II. The rise in taxation is due in large part to the erosion,
through inflation, of  the personal exemption and the sharp rise in payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The next generation is already under assault from the present government's
spending habits. The  national debt is a $70,000 mortgage on the back of every
child under 18. Instead of allowing Americans to pass  a patrimony of wealth on
to their children, entitlement programs are eating their future earnings.
Children  have become not dependents, but providers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The collapse  almost extinction  of two-parent families in many
neighborhoods has contributed heavily  to the collapse of those neighborhoods.
The absence of fathers means there is no adult male financial  support, guiding
hand, or protection for children. The result: gangs of young men driven by a
destructive credo  in place of paternal guidance, young girls vulnerable to
abuse, children having children, and mindless,  violent crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, institutions in poor neighborhoods that once provided help and
guidance to those lacking it  at home have been crowded out by the burgeoning
welfare state. Caring and knowing local people have  been replaced by armies of
professional social workers and bureaucrats who emphasize rights and rules,  not
freedom and responsibility. Effective faith-based solutions to educational and
social deficiencies are  barred from receiving government funds to carry out
their work  and if they are able to receive support, it is  often only by giving
up their religious message.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain these elements in the decline of American
society, declines already well  ad
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vanced in the inner cities and
growing in our suburbs, and they must warn electors that it will take  many
years to rebuild the social fabric because so much long-term damage has been
done. The key to  rebuilding society is rebuilding the family and unshackling
the institutions that complement the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rebuilding society by rebuilding the family, however, requires reversing the
harmful effects of decades  of government social engineering. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The increase in illegitimacy.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, illegitimate births hovered at low rates. In recent decades,
however, this pattern has  changed radically. According to the most recent
statistics released by the Center for Health Statistics at the  U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, illegitimacy continues to rise rapidly and
marriage continues  to decline across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recently released HHS data show that out-of-wedlock births represented 31.0
percent of all births  in 1993, up from 30.1 percent just a year earlier. For
certain groups and parts of the country, the rates  are alarmingly high  as high
as 82 percent in one state. For all groups in all parts of the country, the
trend is  the same: steadily upwards at similar rates of increase. 
</P>
<P>

<P>Among whites in 1993, 23.6 percent of births were out of wedlock, up from 11
percent in 1980.  Among blacks, 68.7 percent of births were out of wedlock in
1993, up from 58 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most useful tool in measuring the decline in marriage and the growth in
illegitimacy is the illegitimacy  rate (more formally called the illegitimacy
ratio). The illegitimacy rate or ratio measures the number of  out-of-wedlock
births in a given year as a percent of all births in that year. Thus, if there
were 100 births, and 30  of those births were out of wedlock, the illegitimacy
rate or ratio would be 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The illegitimacy rate is important because it measures the extent to which
illegitimacy is displacing  marriage in our society. Moreover, it is widely
recognized that illegitimacy is a profound underlying factor  contributing to
most other social problems. The illegitimacy rate is the best possible tool for
indicating the  potential magnitude of a wide array of future social problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="soc_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the illegitimacy rate in the U.S. has increased rapidly
over the last 30 years.

<P>
</P>
<P>The continuing rise in the illegitimacy rate is propelled by three factors:

<P>In terms of family breakdown and the threat to children not growing up in a

marriage contribute to the severing of society's  former linking of children,
marriage, and sexual intercourse. There is only one large sample survey,
reported in  1989 by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which gives a snapshot of
the rates of abortion within and outside  of marriage. <TT><B><A

<P>If this ratio is applied (as the best approximation we have from research)
to the incidence of abortion  since 1973, then the following picture emerges:
The vast proportion of abortions occur among those  committed neither to the
child nor to a spouse  in other words, among the unattached. The best way to 
reduce abortion is to reduce sexual intercourse outside of marriage. This means
a cultural change that  depends primarily on the effectiveness of the family,
the church, and schools at their tasks; such a change is  not possible through
government action alone.

</P>
<P>The five stages in the development of most serious criminals most frequently
have their beginnings in  the abandonment of the child by the father. Add abuse
and neglect in early childhood, and the child is on  his way to a serious life
of crime.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Stage One: Parental neglect and abandonment in early home
life</B> are characterized by different  combinations of the following:
fatherlessness, absence of a mother's love, parental fighting and domestic
violence, lack  of parental supervision and discipline, rejection of the child,
parental abuse and neglect, or criminal parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Two: The embryonic gang</B> emerges as young, unsocialized,
aggressive children, rejected by their  more normal peers, seek and find other
alienated children, fail at school, lose interest in education, and begin  to
run wild.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Three: The embryonic gang of grade school changes into a gang</B>
of tough, exploitative teenagers  who gradually become more and more expert in
crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Four: Violence emerges as a way of life</B> within the gang as the
more expert learn to do their  crime without getting caught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Five: A new baby is born</B> to the now-criminal young father, who
stays with the child's mother for  a while before abandoning her and her child.
The mother comes from a background similar to the  young criminal father's.

<P>
</P>
<P>The more single-parent families we put in place, the more likely it is that
increasing numbers of children  will experience this pathway to crime. Overall,
a 10 percent increase in illegitimacy leads to a 17  percent increase in serious
violent crime (see <a href="soc_8.gif">Chart 8</a>). With the continued rise in illegitimacy, we will
see more  and more violent criminals coming onto our streets as they reach their
mid-teenage years. And with the  appearance of these criminals, we will lose
more and more of our everyday freedoms, and will be forced to  pay other huge
social and economic costs.

300,000 addicts. The numbers are very clear:  twenty times more triers, twenty

adults. If they believe that the risk goes up in using drugs, their usage goes

<P><B>How the Tax System Hurts Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to the cultural onslaught on family life, the tax burden on
families with children has raised the  cost of having children and forced many
couples to endure a trade-off between time at home and time spent  at work
earning money to support the family. More and more couples function like a tag
team, with one  at home with the children while the other works, or work
concurrent shifts while the children are at school or  in day care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last few decades, the tax system has removed much of the help it
once gave to parents  raising young children. Rather than defend the family and
encourage marriage, the tax code now does almost  the opposite.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median-income family of four paid 2 percent of its gross annual
earnings to the federal  government in income and payroll taxes. Today, it pays
24 percent. In addition, state and local taxes on  average take another 14
percent from the family's gross  income. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#48">48</A></B></TT>  The main reasons this
burden has risen  so sharply, other than the general increase in taxes, are that
the personal exemption has been eroded  by inflation and payroll taxes have
risen.

<P>Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American family
with children paid only  3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today, the same
family pays 24.5 percent. The average family  now loses $10,060 of income due to
the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family  income.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#49">49</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax code is riddled with other anti-family, or anti-marriage, or
anti-mother-at-home inequities.  For example, there is a child care allowance
for parents who work but not for those who stay at home with  their children. If
two fathers both earn $20,000, for example, and the mother in one family goes
out to work,  that family not only has her extra income, but also can deduct up
to $1,600 for child care expenses. But if  the mother in the other family
sacrifices the extra income to stay home to look after her children, that 
family receives no tax break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Moreover, the spouse who stays at home to look after the children is
penalized by the tax code in  her savings for old age. While a working mother is
allowed to invest $2,000 a year in a tax-deferred IRA,  a stay-at-home mother is
allowed to invest only $250 per year.

<P><B>The 1995 Congressional Tax Credit Proposal of $500 per Child </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the budget process of 1995, Congress passed a tax credit of $500 per
child to help alleviate  the financial stress on families with children.
President Clinton, by contrast, offered a $300 tax credit that  is phased in at
higher income levels, phased out at lower income levels, and does not apply to
children  over the age of 12.

Families with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see their entire

three children earning up to $26,000 also would have  their income tax bill
eliminated.

<P><B>Cutting taxes for all families regardless of income is fair.</B>
Congress's plan will cut the income tax burden of  a family of four earning
$30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income tax burden of a family  earning
$40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000
would see its tax  burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000
per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.

</P>
<P><B>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent to

$10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase  in federal taxes as
a share of family income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on

<P><B>The Effect of Debt on America's Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The welfare state, with its ever-expanding appetite for taxes and
expenditures, has misdirected and  wasted a huge portion of the money in the
nation's economy. The deficit has soared as a direct result of this  unbridled
appetite, jeopardizing not only present income, but also the future incomes of
many generations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At present, America has 70,020,000 children under 18 and a deficit burden of
$4.887 trillion, or  $70,000 per child under 18. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#50">50</A></B></TT>  This means that even if
Congress balanced all future budgets and kept up with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  interest payments, every child
under 18 still faces a future mortgage of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> To appreciate the effect this has on the economy, consider the opposite:
Rather than a mortgage  of $70,000 on each child, assume an investment of
$70,000 in each child at birth. This investment would  yield huge benefits.
Indeed, $70,000 invested at birth would grow to over $11,000,000 (in future

<P>The national debt, however, will have the opposite effects on our children:

<P>In solid families with good traditions, parents strive to add to the
patrimony (inheritance) they leave  their children, expecting them to do
likewise for the grandchildren. Parents who not only would leave nothing,  but

profligate spending incur  appropriate scorn and are seen as economic pariahs.
The welfare state is doing this to our children.

<P>A Further Result of Federal Taxes: Family Time Famine. Getting adequate

<P><B>Themes for Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's often disparaged, traditional two-parent family is the principal
social institution by which the  work ethic, self-discipline, intellectual
motivation, and moral character are passed on to the next generation.  The
traditional family is the foundation of American society, and when it is
weakened, the nation is weakened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades, the government has pursued policies which help assure the
collapse of the family. To  change course, fundamental changes are required in a
wide range of policies. These changes embody five themes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 1: Reducing the government financial burden on working families. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The traditional family is the original department of health,
education, and welfare, but government  for decades has engaged in punitive
policies which discourage marriage and make it difficult for the  traditional
family to carry out its functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median family of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the
federal government in  taxes. Today, that figure has risen to 24 percent; when
state and local taxes are thrown in, the typical family of  four now pays 38
percent of its income in taxes to the government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the War on Poverty
has been borne in  large measure by the middle class, especially by parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when they have married, have put off having  children
and reduced the number of children they raise.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ironically, even as its punitive tax policy discourages child rearing by
traditional middle-class families,  the government continues to subsidize child
rearing by never-married women who generally are ill-prepared  to act as
parents. The results of this disastrous policy are only too apparent. Current
government policy,  which places punitive and crippling financial burdens on
traditional two-parent families while subsidizing  illegitimacy, is a recipe for
eventual social collapse. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 2: Reforming welfare to control costs and require work to improve
the lot of the &quot;welfare family.&quot;  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Today's welfare system crushes low-income families by placing
anti-family requirements on mothers as  the price of receiving welfare, as well
as by discouraging employment. The steps needed to change this  destructive
incentive system are outlined in the accompanying chapter on welfare reform.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 3: Reducing illegitimacy. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Societies through the ages have recognized that it takes the
efforts of at least two persons, a father and  a mother, to provide the economic
and psychological support needed to raise children. Women who  have children out
of wedlock invariably impose a heavy financial burden on the society around
them. A  father's absence also threatens the psychological well-being of his
children. Thus, societies historically have gone  to great lengths to encourage
marriage and, conversely, to discourage illegitimacy. In the recent past,  the
United States has experimented with reversing this common wisdom by aggressively
subsidizing  single parenthood and penalizing marriage. The results of this
experiment have been disastrous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the well-being of American children and the safety of society, a moral
sense of responsible  parenthood must be restored, based on the commonsense
principle that it is immoral to have children unless one is  fully prepared to
raise those children. To be fully prepared to raise children means three simple
things. First,  the mother and father must be married and committed to a life
together. Second, they must be mature  and psychologically ready for the
difficult task of raising the young. Third, they should be economically 
productive and self-sufficient, able to sustain a family without large amounts
of ongoing financial support from  the larger community.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 4: Reforming divorce law and strengthening marriage. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Over the past 40 years, government policy has made divorce
easily available, and welfare has  subsidized family breakup. The principal
victims have been children. These trends should be reversed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While divorce and marriage law should remain under the control of state
legislatures, it is clear that levels  of divorce and marital instability have
direct repercussions on the federal welfare system and on the  overall
well-being of America's children. Thus, the federal government should use the &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; to urge  reforms at the state level.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 5: Revitalizing civil society. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#58">58</A></B></TT></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>While reforms in taxes, divorce law, and welfare are necessary
steps in dealing with the problems of  family disintegration and the underclass,
they are not sufficient in themselves. Welfare programs in particular,  by
subsidizing self-destructive behavior, have played a huge role in promoting
underclass problems. But  welfare is not the sole cause of these burgeoning
problems: Changing cultural values and norms concerning  sexual behavior,
marriage, work, respect for others, and self-control have played a heavy  role.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#59">59</A></B></TT>  Members of
Congress and others seeking a comprehensive solution must look beyond reforming
welfare programs  and into the broader culture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government leaders seeking to reestablish sound norms and virtuous behavior
within vulnerable  groups would do well to look to the past. Few people realize
that 19th century America fought several wars  on poverty which, in contrast to
the 20th century version, were quite successful. These historic  anti-poverty
efforts were headed by non-governmental institutions, primarily churches, which
saw poverty as  emanating from behavior and individual  character. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>  They took as their
central task the molding of character and  self-discipline within vulnerable
low-income communities. For example:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)
was established to combat urban crime. Seeing  its mission as molding the moral
character of the young, the YMCA successfully undertook a struggle to  win the
hearts and minds of inner-city youth, leading to a major drop in juvenile crime.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Catholic parochial education is a dramatic instance of long-lasting
private voluntary endeavor. In  founding Georgetown University in 1792, Bishop
John Carroll argued for the necessity of a &quot;pious and  Catholic education
for the young.&quot;  Carroll hoped that Georgetown's graduates would supply a
pool of teachers  for the Catholic schools of local parishes. Today those
schools provide superior education, open to children  of all faiths, and of
tremendous importance to poor inner-city parents seeking an alternative to
public  education.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) gave a chaperoned place
to live to young  women migrating to the cities from rural areas. The stability
immediately available to them permitted them  gradually to find the community
life in which they felt comfortable, and safe fellowship after leaving their
families  and original communities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The Red Cross is a massive private-sector organization which runs the
world's largest blood collection  and distribution system as just one of its
projects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The temperance movement of the mid-1800s, a response to the growing
alcohol addiction of the  time, resulted in massive reductions in alcohol
consumption and a change of attitude toward the abuse of alcohol. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dealing with social problems by placing greater reliance on non-governmental
social institutions is  therefore nothing new. It is a return to the fundamental
political philosophy upon which the American Republic  was established. The
Founders, because they understood the dangers inherent in looking to government
as  a cure for social ills, relied instead on civil institutions such as the
family and church.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This wisdom is reflected in the writings of one of the most astute observers
of American politics and  society, Alexis de Tocqueville. De Tocqueville
emphasized the crucial role in American society of such  &quot;private
associations&quot; as religious institutions, private philanthropies, clubs,
fellowships, voluntary civic  associations, and private moral and educational
institutions. According to de Tocqueville, these private associations  or civil
institutions were more important than America's political and economic
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the functions of private civil associations was to affirm, renew, and
sustain social virtues. It was  their task to inculcate into Americans the basic
virtues and norms which make civilized life possible.  Without these
value-affirming and renewing institutions, Americans would soon lose their
capacity to maintain  healthy families, to work honestly and diligently, to
educate and govern themselves, and even to live next to  one another without
murder and mayhem. In other words, civil institutions provided the moral
foundation  which made the political and economic superstructure possible, and
their ability to shape individual character  and to inculcate individuals with
the virtues and norms necessary for social life was essential to the 
continuance of society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last hundred years, however, government has usurped much of the
role of civil associations.  One social function after another  education,
charity, and, increasingly, child-rearing  has passed from  civil institutions
into the hands of government bureaucrats. By arrogating to itself more and more
of those  functions, and by monopolizing an ever-larger share of the financial
resources needed for operation of  civil institutions, government decisively
undermines private civil associations. By diminishing and  shouldering aside
value-affirming institutions, government wages war on society's natural immune
system. The  growing underclass and the collapse of the family are only two of
the many problems which stem from this assault.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Crucial Role of Religion.</B> In grappling with the burgeoning
problems of family disintegration, crime,  and dependence, Americans must
utilize all the vital resources within society. History, common sense,  and
research all show that there is one neglected institution ideally suited to lead
this struggle of moral renewal  in low-income communities and across the nation:
the church. Efforts to tackle underclass problems in the  19th century succeeded
largely because they were spearheaded by value-laden religious institutions. By 
contrast, efforts to fight urban poverty in the 20th century frequently have
failed because of their reliance on  value-free government programs.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Moral poverty is the poverty of being without loving, capable,
responsible adults who teach you right  from wrong. It is the poverty of being

wrong. It is the  poverty of growing up in the virtual absence of people who
teach morality by their own everyday example  and who insist that you follow
suit.... In the extreme, moral poverty is the poverty of growing up surrounded 
by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults in abusive, violence-ridden,
fatherless, Godless, and jobless  settings. In sum, whatever their material
circumstances, kids of whatever their race, creed, or color are most likely  to

And on abstinence, he has said that &quot;we need  to send a strong signal that
it is essential for young people to delay sexual activity, as well as having 
children, until they are ready to accept the responsibilities and consequences
of these actions. It is critical that we  help all youth understand the rewards

<P>During his presidential campaign, candidate Bill Clinton promised a tax
credit of $800 per  child. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#74">74</A></B></TT>
 But in 1993, he gave families the biggest tax hike in history, which also means
he has taken more money  and parental time away from the family than anyone in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Congress included a $500-per-child tax credit in the Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1996,  President Clinton opposed it as giving money to the
rich even though almost 90 percent of the monies went to  middle-class and
poorer families. However, as Table 2 shows, the relief to the poor was higher at
every stage in  the congressional plan than in the Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Illegitimacy:</B> In the welfare reform package which passed the
House and Senate and which was part  of the budget reconciliation package sent
to the President in November 1993, Congress moved to reduce  the welfare rewards
and reinforcements for increased numbers of children out of wedlock. Congress 
forbade states to spend federal monies for increased welfare payments for new
children born out of wedlock  while the mother was on welfare. (States could
spend their own money for these increased payments.)  The President vetoed the
bill.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Abortion:</B> Congress outlawed the use of partial birth abortions, a
procedure involving cranial collapse  of the seven to nine month old fetus
followed by dismemberment and suction removal. The President  has promised to
veto it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fatherlessness:</B> Congress toughened the child support provisions in
the welfare bill which was part of  the reconciliation package vetoed by the
President in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pro-family tax changes:</B> Historically mothers who stay at home to
care for young children have been  penalized in the regulations covering
individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Congress, in the budget  reconciliation
bill, removed the discrimination against these mothers. President Clinton vetoed
the bill.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to arresting America's moral decay is to restore the historic
balance between the state and  civil society  to revitalize those private
institutions which are society's natural immune system.  Destructive policy
influences must be reversed, and the beneficial effects of non-governmental
institutions must  be allowed once again to play their full role in rebuilding
civil society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These themes translate into the following policy prescriptions:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut taxes on middle-class families with children at both the federal and
state levels. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Healthy families are the foundation of a successful society,
and government must seek to strengthen  marriage as the crucial institution
within which future generations of Americans will be raised. The most obvious 
step is to reduce sharply the crippling tax burden it now places on young
working and middle-class parents  with children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress but vetoed by
President Clinton is only a  first step in this regard. This tax credit should
be enacted now and followed by larger tax cuts for families  with children in
the near future.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Create a pro-marriage tax credit at the federal and state levels. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The current welfare system heavily penalizes marriage between a
mother and a working man. This  marriage penalty should be reduced through
creation of a tax credit for lower-income parents who are married  and working
rather than living on welfare. The pro-marriage tax credit should be available
to  low-income married couples who are living together and supporting dependent
children; the family should have  the equivalent of at least one adult working
full time. The credit should be refundable and should have a  maximum value of
$1,000.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Avoid false solutions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>One simplistic solution to the anti-marriage and anti-work
effects of welfare would be to allow a  welfare mother to retain all or most of
her benefits after she has taken a job or married a fully employed male.  But
this approach would be unfair to working single mothers and to low-income,
working married couples  who never went on welfare in the first place. Moreover,
it would give low- and moderate-income parents a  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  incentive to enroll in welfare,
at least briefly, to become eligible for the long-term continuing benefits. Such
 a system would degenerate inevitably into one in which the majority of low- and
moderate-income single-  and two-parent families received substantial welfare
payments, raising the overall cost of welfare by hundreds  of billions of
dollars per year. Realistic reformers must seek to alter welfare incentives in a
more  practical manner.

 more information on how to say &quot;no&quot; to a boyfriend's requests for sex

<P>Congress should pass a $5,000 tax credit for couples who adopt a child,
fundable (that is, those who  do not pay $5,000 in federal taxes still should
receive $5,000 support) so that poorer families will be  encouraged to adopt and
not be left out of the pool of adopting parents.

<P>
</P>
<P>While the numbers of children born out of wedlock have been increasing
massively, the practice of  adoption has been decreasing.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->

among adopted children.  Adopted children do as well as or better than their
non-adopted  counterparts. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#82">82</A></B></TT>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single
parents and less involved in  alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police
trouble, weapon use, and  theft; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#84">84</A></B></TT> they score higher on
self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directness, positive view of

 Adopted children do well at school. In 1988, only 7 percent of children adopted

 By contrast, 33 percent of children whose mothers had never married repeated a

<P>
</P>
<P>Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better then
unmarried teen mothers who  choose to become single parents. Unmarried teen
mothers who choose adoption have higher educational  aspirations and are more
likely to finish school than mothers who keep their children; are less likely to
live in  poverty and receive public assistance; are more likely to marry
eventually; are more likely to be employed  12 months after the birth and less

depression or other negative psychological consequences than mothers who rear
children as single  parents. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#89">89</A></B></TT>
 Thus, all goals of liberal government programs such as job training,

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
These barriers include  anti-adoption bias in pregnancy counseling, with most
counselors not even raising the option of adoption;  misuse of the family
preservation principle in social work, which prolongs the danger to severely
abused  children instead of rescuing them and placing them for adoption sooner;
overload and confusion of social  service roles, with the work of preserving
families sometimes in seeming conflict with that of rescuing children  in danger
(most social service agencies do not resolve this dilemma and leave the burden
to the child);  unsatisfactory protections of confidentiality, which inhibit the
adoption option; unknown, uninvolved, or  unmarried fathers who increasingly, at
local court levels are permitted to block adoption processes; and the race of 
the child and the adoptive parents, with many social workers against transracial
adoptions even if parents of  the same race as the child are not readily
available to adopt (which puts the burden on the child rather than  on the
community).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enforce statutory rape laws at the state level.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Male accountability is needed. In many inner-city communities, when 16- or
17-year-old girls  become pregnant, the father is often four or five years older
than the girl. Such cases often involve statutory rape,  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  serious criminal offense.
Congress should hold hearings to emphasize the role of statutory rape in 
contributing to pregnancy among young girls, and the states should act
vigorously and visibly to enforce their  statutory rape laws in such cases as a
way to deter such predatory male behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>End &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce at the state level and require waiting
periods, mediation, and counseling.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In most states today, it is easier to terminate a marriage contract than a
contract to purchase a new  washing machine. Marriage is America's most
important social institution; steps must be taken to restore its  sanctity and
the seriousness of marital commitment. State governments immediately should
eliminate no-fault  divorce for couples with children. In the future, the major
share of the costs of divorce, as well as the future costs  of raising the
children, should be borne by the parent who is at fault (or by the party who
initiated the divorce  if no fault is found). Couples seeking a divorce who have
children should be required to undertake  counseling, and states should
establish a six-month waiting period for completion of any divorce action.
During  divorce proceedings, children should be represented by a separate
attorney tasked with representing their  interests (which often may be for the
parents to remain together).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage pre-marriage counseling.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Marriage is a legal and social institution designed to enforce the binding
commitments of a man and  a woman to one another, and to provide the best
environment for the raising of children within society.  Society has an interest
and obligation (to children not yet born) to seek to ensure that marriages which
are  formed will have a good chance of not only enduring, but flourishing.
States should insist that individuals  receive some form of pre-marital
counseling as a condition of receiving a marriage license.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of counseling should be an evaluation to inform prospective spouses of
the probability that their  marriage will end in divorce. Modern evaluation
devices such as the PREPARE (Premarital Personal  and Relationship Evaluation)
questionnaire can predict with an accuracy of over 80 percent whether a 
marriage will end in divorce. PREPARE already is offered by thousands of
churches across the nation. It is in the  best interest of all concerned
(especially the children yet unborn) that the fiancees be informed of their 
prospects for marital success before they have embarked on what should be a
lifelong  commitment. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#90">90</A></B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fight moral decay through school choice at the federal and state levels.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The plight of the underclass is rooted in behavior; behavior in turn is
molded by the cultural values  and norms of low-income communities and the
larger society. For the problems of the underclass to be  solved, there must be
a dramatic change in behavior, which in turn will require an enormous shift in
underlying  norms and values. Policymakers must seek to reanimate within
low-income communities the ethical  principles which are the foundation of a
successful society. To combat the growing problem of the underclass,  Americans
need a multi-dimensional policy which harnesses all the vital forces in our
society. But in the war  against poverty and violence, the most effective social
weapon  the church  lies dormant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to harnessing the church's untapped social strength is another
crucial public policy issue:  school choice. Poor parents should be given
vouchers equivalent to the sum which is spent educating their  children in the
public schools. These parents would be free to use the voucher to place their
children into a school  of their own choice, including private religious
schools. If voucher plans were put in place in large cities,  dozens of
high-quality private religious schools would spring up immediately in each city,
operating as adjuncts  of urban churches. Many low-income parents, struggling to
save their sons and daughters from the social  tide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  of violence, drugs, and sexual
promiscuity, would be overjoyed to place their children under the firm  moral
tutelage of such church-related schools, each one of which would function as a
focal point of moral  renewal emanating into the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson (and many Members of 
Congress), <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#91">91</A></B></TT>
who are wealthy enough to send their children to private schools, poor parents
are left with the inert monopoly of the  public schools, institutions which no
longer can adequately teach simple reading, let alone serve as the focal  point
for moral transformation within underclass communities. In grappling with the
problems of dependence  and the underclass, education voucher programs for
low-income parents are an indispensable complement  to welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals will argue that providing parents with vouchers which can be used
in religious schools violates  the First Amendment prohibition on establishment
of religion. This is untrue. The Supreme Court has  clearly ruled, in <I>Mueller
v. Allen</I> and <I>Witters v. Washington State Department of Services for the 
Blind</I>, that vouchers or tax credits can be spent for religious education
without creating constitutional problems. Just  as a widow can place her Social
Security check in the collection plate of a church or synagogue, or a  veteran
can use funds from the GI Bill to go to seminary without violating the
constitutional provisions against  state-established religion, a poor parent may
use education vouchers to place a child in a religious school. As  long as the
parent, not the government, decides where the voucher funds will be spent, the
government  has neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion, and there
is no violation of the religious  establishment clause of the First Amendment.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#92">92</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The church is thus America's strongest weapon in the war against family
disintegration, crime, drugs,  and despair in low-income communities. Churches
can succeed in tackling these problems where  government has failed. Instead of
relegating the churches to the social periphery, policymakers must unleash their
 energy, permitting them to play a much greater role in molding the character of
youth and adults.  Specifically, Congress should redirect a substantial portion
of federal aid to primary and secondary education into  model voucher programs
for poor parents in inner cities.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what their moral
values should be? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Government is not the fundamental moral teacher; that is the duty
of the church or synagogue and  the family itself, the first and most intimate
source of moral instruction. But government does have a  profound responsibility
to inform American taxpayers about the costs and consequences of personal 
behaviors, including violations of the marriage contract, child abuse, or the
dramatic growth in out-of-wedlock  birth, precisely because of their profoundly
negative social impact on the character and quality of American  life:
increasing numbers of psychologically damaged children, rising crime and
juvenile delinquency,  substance abuse and welfare dependency. Americans are
free to live by any moral code they wish, or none at all.  But they should not
expect taxpayers to pick up the tab, without imposing any conditions, for what 
traditionally has been understood to be immoral behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what form of family
they are to have?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> From time immemorial, government in every civilized society has
recognized marriage and the family  as the basic and most venerable institutions
of the social order. Indeed, government has always had a  direct 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  interest in both the
establishment and maintenance of the traditional marriage contract and the
family,  the mutual obligations of a husband and wife and of parents to their
children. To that end, an entire body  of domestic law has been established,
governing everything from the state's issuance of marriage licenses to  the
preservation of family property and inheritance and the protection of children.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, Americans are free to experiment and to have any &quot;alternative
family arrangements&quot; they  wish. But the empirical evidence is overwhelming
that the intact, two-parent family is superior to any other  arrangement.
Children thrive and do better in stable married families than anywhere else.
Their health,  their learning, their income, their mental and emotional
well-being, and their avoidance of drugs, crime,  welfare dependency, and
illegitimacy are much lower than those of children in single-parent families.
America  is stronger because of married families and weaker when families are
broken or unformed. As a matter  of public policy, therefore, it is perfectly
reasonable to promote and preserve the traditional family. As a  matter of
public policy, it is perfectly unreasonable to do anything else.

</P>
<P><B>Q. What has been the record of federal drug treatment (as opposed to
enforcement) programs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Poor. Federal drug treatment spending almost tripled between 1988
and 1994, but the number  of persons treated actually declined from 1.5 million
in 1989 to 1.4 million in  1994. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#93">93</A></B></TT>  Most addicts have been
through treatment more than once. As summed up by John Walters, deputy director
of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Bush
Administration, &quot;The harsh fact is that drug  addicts like taking drugs,
even though most of them also dislike some aspects and consequences of their
drug  use. They sometimes admit themselves to treatment programs, not to stop
using their drugs, but to regain  greater control over their drug use; but the
overwhelming majority of addicts entering treatment with the goal  of ending
their drug use are coerced to do so by the courts, family members, or employers.
That is why  the liberals who discuss treatment as if it were the opposite of
enforcement show a profound ignorance of  the reality of drug treatment.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#94">94</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would conservatives fashion a policy on drug treatment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Congress should combine federal anti-drug support to states and
localities (estimated at $3.5 billion  in FY 1994) into anti-drug block grants
for states and local communities. In this way, states and local  communities can
use these funds for anti-drug treatment and rehabilitation programs that work
best. At the  same time, it is essential that Congress establish performance
standards so that organizations receiving  funds demonstrate that they are
effective in treating addicts. Interestingly, some of the best drug and  alcohol
treatment and rehabilitation programs in the nation are those that are connected
with religious or  faith-based institutions. They are successful precisely
because they are able to effect a deep internal or spiritual  commitment on the
part of addicts to resist the use of illegal drugs or the abuse of alcohol.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since World War II, Presidents and Members of Congress  have promised
American taxpayers that they would reform, in a  serious way, America's failed
welfare system. The reality, however, is  that the system keeps growing, new
programs are introduced  when earlier reforms do not work, and the level of
spending on  federal and state welfare programs continues to increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is a growing consensus that the current welfare system is  a disaster,
not only for taxpayers who are required to pay ever  larger amounts of money to
maintain and expand the system, but also  for the poor who supposedly are being
helped by it. While liberals  and conservatives agree that the current welfare
system is badly  broken, only conservatives have been prepared to take the steps
 to achieve structural reform  in 1995, liberals actually fought  to block
reform. In the election of 1996, conservative  candidates need to articulate the
clear choice. In particular, they must  remind voters that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>President Clinton promised serious welfare reform, but when  Congress
sent him legislation that would have accomplished this,  he vetoed it.</B>
Welfare reform remains a major domestic issue for  the President and Congress.
While the President promised in 1992  &quot;to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  end welfare as we know it,&quot;
the Clinton Administration's bill  did nothing of the sort. It did not stop
exploding welfare costs. It  did not establish meaningful work requirements. And
it did not  address the persistent problem of additional out-of-wedlock  births
among women who are getting welfare benefits. While  the President's bill
proposed a two-year time limit on welfare, a  reading of the fine print revealed
that it merely placed a few  welfare recipients in government &quot;make work&quot;
jobs while allowing  them to remain on welfare. Moreover, the work requirements
were  truly weak. The bill required only 7 percent of the welfare population  to
enroll in the work program by 1999, and would have  required those enrolled to
work for only 15 hours per week. Worse,  instead of controlling spending, the
Clinton plan would have continued  the automatic and rapid growth of welfare
spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, Congress passed a serious welfare reform  bill that
establishes serious work requirements, addresses the  problem of illegitimacy,
and slows the growth in federal welfare  spending. The President vetoed this
bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Current welfare costs are rising, and without some fiscal  discipline
imposed by Congress, taxpayers will be saddled with  enormous future tax
burdens.</B>  There are 77 overlapping welfare programs  to assist Americans
officially designated as poor. Total  welfare spending in the United States
exceeds $324 billion, or over  $3,400 for each taxpaying household in the United
States. Of this  spending, 72 percent is federal and 28 percent is state. About
90  percent of all state welfare spending is on federally designed welfare 
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress strongly support federal welfare  programs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  defend the current rate of
spending for these programs, and  oppose even modest reductions in the rate of
growth of welfare  spending. At current rates, the United States will be
spending $500 billion  on welfare by 1999, or a full 6 percent of the gross
national  product (GNP). Under current federal spending scenarios, this would 
mean $2 on welfare for every $1 we now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Most important, serious welfare reform must address the illegitimacy
crisis.</B> In 1959, 28 percent of poor families with  children were headed by
women. By 1991, 61 percent of poor families  with children were headed by single
women. The illegitimate birth  rate among white high school dropouts is now a
stunning 48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Aside from its relationship to federal welfare policy,  America's overall
rate of illegitimacy is a social catastrophe. The social  science literature on
the subject is unambiguous and  indisputable: Children born out of wedlock do
not have the same chances in  life as do children born into intact two-parent
families. Children  born out of wedlock have lower levels of educational 
achievement, lower economic achievement, increased psychological and  behavioral
problems, and a greater propensity to substance abuse,  juvenile delinquency,
and crime. For the President and Congress,  the key relationship between the
growing problem of illegitimacy  and welfare policy is this: Should illegitimacy
be the basis of a  government entitlement to benefits?  Americans either are or
are not  going to subsidize illegitimacy. There are no compromises on  this
point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Needed: A Serious Policy for Welfare  Reform.</B> In overhauling this
failed system, policymakers should be guided by the  following four themes: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  Reduce illegitimacy.</B> First, and most important,
welfare  reform must seek to reduce the illegitimate birth rate and promote the 
formation of stable two-parent families. Any &quot;reform&quot; that does  not
dramatically reduce the illegitimate birth rate will not save  money and will
fail to help America's children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Demand reciprocity and work.</B> Reform must convert  welfare from a
one-way handout into a system of mutual responsibility  in which welfare
recipients are given aid but also are expected  to contribute something to
society for the assistance given. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Get costs under control.</B> Reform must control soaring  welfare
costs, which are slowly bankrupting the nation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Promote moral renewal.</B> Halting the growth of the  underclass
ultimately will require not only welfare reform, but also moral  and cultural
renewal. The government can assist in the process  of moral rebuilding by
allowing private social institutions, such  as churches and other community
institutions, to play a far  greater role in educating and shaping the moral
code of young  people. Among other steps needed to do this, parents must be
given  far greater choice in how their children are educated, including  the
right to use government vouchers to send their children to  religious schools.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A> </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Social collapse over the last 30 years has coincided with growth  in the
welfare state. The U.S. welfare system may be defined as  the total set of
government programs, federal and state, explicitly  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  signed to assist poor and
low-income Americans. Current  welfare assistance has three ostensible
objectives: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1) Sustaining</B> living standards through cash and non-cash transfers, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2) Promoting</B> self-sufficiency, and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3) Aiding </B>economically distressed communities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most welfare programs are individually means-tested.  Means-tested programs
restrict eligibility for benefits to persons with  non-welfare income below a
certain level. Individuals with  non-welfare income above a specified cutoff
level cannot receive aid. Thus,  for example, food stamps and Aid to Families
with Dependent  Children (AFDC) are means-tested, and thus constitute welfare, 
but Social Security benefits are not. Some 94 percent of total  welfare spending
takes the form of means-tested aid given directly to  individuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other welfare programs are community-targeted or  categorical.
Community-targeted programs provide assistance to  communities which contain a
high percentage of poor and low-income  persons or are economically distressed.
Some 5.2 percent of welfare  spending is directed through programs of this kind.
Pure categorical  programs provide aid to specific disadvantaged or generally 
needy groups, such as migrant farm workers, homeless persons, or  abandoned
children, without a formal means test. Only 1.2 percent  of total welfare
spending is dedicated to simple categorical programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Size of the Welfare System
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently runs 77 major interrelated  and overlapping
welfare programs. Many states also operate their  own independent programs. This
federal and state welfare system  now includes cash aid, food, medical aid,
housing aid, energy aid,  jobs and training, targeted and means-tested
education, social  service, and urban and community development programs. A list
of the  80 major federal and state welfare programs covered in this study  is
provided in the Heritage Foundation  monograph<I> America's Failed $5.4
Trillion War on  Poverty</I>.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In 1993, 48 percent of total welfare spending was devoted
to  medical programs. Cash programs took 22.1 percent. Food,  housing, and
energy programs comprised 18.8 percent of the total,  while education aid, job
training, social services, and urban and  community aid accounted for 11.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Total federal and state spending on welfare programs was  $324.3
billion in FY 1993. Of that total, $234.3 billion (72 percent)  came from
federal funding and $90 billion (28 percent) came from  state or local funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Welfare spending is so large it is difficult to comprehend. One  way
to make it more tangible is to recognize that, on average, the  cost of the
welfare system amounted to $3,357 in taxes from  each household that paid
federal income tax in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Federal and state welfare spending is now the third largest  category
of total government spending, ranking below the first  (combined Social Security
and Medicare) and second (total  government spending on general education) but
above the fourth (national  defense).

<P><B>How the Welfare State Has Grown</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#2">2</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the first 150 years of U.S. history, the government played  little role
in welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#3">3</A>  Charity or welfare
was conducted largely by  private religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As late as 1929, before the onset of the Great Depression,  federal, state,
and local welfare expenditures were only $90 million.  Adjusted into 1993
dollars, this would be $813 million.  Public-sector welfare spending in 1929
amounted to $6.68 per person in  1993 dollars. (Unless noted otherwise, all
spending figures in this  section have been adjusted for inflation into constant
1993 dollars.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Charts 1 and 2 show the growth in welfare since 1929. The  Great Depression,
which threw nearly a quarter of the labor force out  of work, led to a dramatic
change in government welfare  spending. Expenditures for work relief welfare
programs such as the  Civilian Conservation Corps, Works Progress
Administration, and  Civil Works Administration grew rapidly. By 1939, welfare
spending  hit a peak of $46.6 billion  compared with less than $1 billion  in
1929 (expressed in 1993 dollars). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In inflation-adjusted terms, welfare spending would not return  to the 1939
peak until the onset of the War on Poverty a  quarter-century later. The major
Great Depression anti-poverty programs  were terminated at the beginning of
World War II. In the post-war  period, welfare spending remained low relative to
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, total welfare spending by federal, state, and local  governments
was $18.8 billion (in 1993 dollars), less than the cost of  the food stamp
program alone in 1993. During the 1950s and  early 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  1960s, welfare spending grew
slowly, reaching $34.9 billion  in 1964 at the onset of the War on Poverty. In
1964, welfare  absorbed 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) as compared
with  1.1 percent in 1950.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Explosion in Spending.</B> In his 1964 State of the Union  address,
President Lyndon Johnson announced the &quot;War on Poverty.&quot;   New
legislation and spending initiatives began to take effect  by 1965. Between 1965
and 1970, over two dozen separate  federal welfare programs were created.
Eligibility for older  programs, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children
and food  stamps, was expanded. In three years (1965-1968), welfare spending  in
constant dollars more than doubled, rising from $38.3 billion  to $80.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the first decade of the War on Poverty, there was  explosive growth in
all categories of welfare spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1965 and 1975, measured in constant dollars, cash  aid nearly
tripled, social service spending tripled, medical aid  almost quintupled, food
aid did quintuple, housing spending  increased sevenfold, and job training funds
increased fifteenfold. By  1975, total welfare spending had reached $119.4
billion (in  constant 1993 dollars), almost a fivefold increase compared with
1965  levels after adjusting for inflation. While total welfare spending 
absorbed 1.3 percent of GDP in 1965, just ten years later, some  3.8 percent of
the economy was devoted to welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since 1975 welfare spending has continued to grow rapidly,  although not at
the record pace of the 1965-1975 decade. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, federal, state, and local welfare
spending  rose from $158 billion in 1975 to $324 billion in 1993. After 
adjusting for inflation, welfare spending has risen in every year but two  from
1965 to the present.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Welfare spending is now 8.4 times greater than in 1965 when  the War
on Poverty began.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Cash, food, housing, and energy aid are six times greater  today than
when the War on Poverty began. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Charts <a href="welf_1.gif">1</a> and <a href="welf_2.gif">2</a> also belie the political myth that President  Reagan slashed
welfare spending. As the charts clearly show,  welfare spending grew during
Reagan's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-      Total welfare spending was $199 billion in 1980 when 
Ronald Reagan was elected President. By 1988, his last year in  office, welfare
spending reached $230 billion. Cash, food, housing,  and energy spending rose
from $89 billion to $102 billion over  the same period (all figures in constant
1993 dollars). Ronald  Reagan did not reduce welfare spending; he merely slowed
its  explosive growth rate.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Claims that Reagan cut welfare spending utilize the simple trick  of
selecting one or two programs in the list of 80 welfare  programs and
deliberately not counting the rest. By selecting one or two  programs that have
been reduced while ignoring the rapid growth  in the other 78, it is possible to
&quot;prove&quot; in every single year that  welfare has been &quot;slashed&quot;
when in fact aggregate spending  continues to increase.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While Reagan slowed the growth of welfare spending, it  exploded during the
Bush presidency at rates that rivaled those of the  late 1960s. In constant 1993
dollars, total welfare spending rose  from $224 billion in 1988, when Bush was
elected, to $324 billion  in 1993, when Clinton assumed the presidency: a $100
billion  increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending Per Low-Income Person. </B>A second way of  examining the
growth of welfare spending is to compare spending  increases with the growth of
the U.S. population. Chart 3 shows total  welfare spending divided by the number
of persons in the lowest  income quarter of the population. This calculation
provides a  reasonably accurate picture of the level of welfare resources 
available relative to the pool of potential  recipients.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#4">4</A>  Chart 3 reveals a now-familiar
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Welfare spending per low-income person was nearly zero in
 1929 but shot up during the Great Depression, reaching a peak of  $1,419 per
low-income person (in 1993 dollars). After World War  II, spending fell to low
levels and remained relatively constant  until the start of the War on Poverty
in 1965. Between 1965 and  1975, spending exploded, growing from $789 per person
to $2,938  (both figures in 1993 dollars). Spending grew moderately during  the
Carter years, leveling off during the Reagan presidency and  then exploding
again during the Bush era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     By 1993, total welfare spending per low-income person  reached $5,023.
In constant dollars, this was three times higher than  the peak level in the
Great Depression.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><a href="welf_4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the same trends in per capita spending but  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  welfare spending figures to cash,
food, housing, and energy  aid. As in the <a href="welf_3.gif">previous chart</a>, welfare spending (in
this case cash,  food, housing, and energy) is divided by the number of persons
in  the lowest income quarter of the population. The chart clearly  rebuts the
claim that the growth in welfare spending has been limited  to medical programs.
The pattern is identical to that of the  previous charts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, welfare spending for the limited
basic  programs peaked during the Great Depression, remained  relatively low and
constant during the 1950s and 1960s, exploded upward  at the onset of the War on
Poverty, and remained in a nearly  vertical climb until the mid-1970s. Spending
leveled off during the  Reagan years and spiked sharply upward again in the late
1980s and  early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In constant dollars, cash, food, housing, and energy aid per  person
is nearly five times higher today than at the beginning of the  War on Poverty.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare Spending as a Share of GDP. </B>Another way to assess  the
growth in welfare spending is to measure the share of the  total economy which
is absorbed by welfare. Chart 5 shows total  federal, state, and local welfare
spending as a percentage of gross  domestic product. The data match the patterns
shown in Charts  1 through 4.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     During the Great Depression, welfare spending rose to
around  4 percent of GDP, peaking at 4.8 percent in 1939. The growth  of
spending as a share of GDP was driven both by increases in  real spending and by
shrinkage in the size of the economy due to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Depression. It is also important
to note that most welfare  spending during the Depression was for work relief
programs, such as  the Civilian Conservation Corps, which bear little
resemblance  to most of today's welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     After World War II, welfare spending fell to 0.5 percent of GDP.  It
rose to slightly over 1 percent in 1950 and remained at that  level through the
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     With the onset of the War on Poverty, a massive share of  the economy
was rapidly diverted to welfare programs.  Welfare spending rose to over 4
percent by the mid-1970s. During  the Reagan years, a slowdown in the growth of
spending, coupled  with a growing economy, led to slight declines in welfare as
a share  of GDP. By 1988, welfare spending was 3.75 percent of GDP.  The Bush
era quickly reversed this trend; by 1993, welfare  constituted 5.08 percent of
GDP, a new record level exceeding the  previous peak set during the Great
Depression.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Comparing Welfare with Other Government Programs. 
</B>A final way to assess the growth in welfare spending is to compare it  to
the increase in spending on other government functions (Chart 6). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Since the onset of the War on Poverty, means-tested 
welfare spending by federal, state, and local governments has grown  more
rapidly than spending on all other major government functions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 17 cents on welfare for each dollar  spent on
national defense. By 1993, this had risen to $1.11 on  welfare for each dollar
spent on defense.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->

<P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 29 cents on welfare for every dollar  spent on

<P>As <a href="welf_8.gif">Chart 8</a> also shows, the $5.4 trillion cost of the War on  Poverty nearly
equals the entire cost of the private-sector industrial  and business
infrastructure of the U.S.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">8</A>  For
$5.4 trillion one can  purchase every factory, all the manufacturing equipment,
and  every office building in the U.S. With the leftover funds, one could  go on

<P>
</P>
<P>It is interesting to note the total cost of the many peripheral  programs
which often are ignored in calculating the cost of welfare  or the War on
Poverty. For example, the $172 billion spent on  urban and community development
is nearly enough to buy the  entire plant and equipment of every auto
manufacturer, every airline,  and every trucking company in the U.S. The $445
billion price tag  for job training and social services for low-income Americans
 would purchase all the steel plants, all the factories producing new 
industrial equipment, all the electronics manufacturing plants, and  all the
furniture plants in the U.S., as well as the whole U.S.  commer
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  cial maritime fleet. With the
$440 billion which the  government has spent in housing and energy aid, one
could purchase the  entire U.S. construction industry, all the hotels in the

<P><B>Impact of the Welfare State on Families and Individuals
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Two Kinds of Poverty.</B> The growth of the welfare state has had  a
huge impact on U.S. society. In order to unravel its  effects, policymakers must
begin by understanding two separate  concepts: &quot;material poverty&quot; and &quot;behavioral
poverty.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Material Poverty.</B> Material poverty means, in the simplest  sense,
having a family income below the official poverty income  threshold, which was
$14,763 for a family of four in 1993. To the  man on the street, to say someone
is poor implies that he is  malnourished, poorly clothed, and living in filthy,
dilapidated, and  overcrowded housing. In reality, there is little material
poverty in  the U.S. as the public generally understands the  term.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#10">10</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1990, after adjusting for inflation, per capita expenditures of  the
lowest income one-fifth of the U.S. population exceeded the  per capita income
of the median American household in  1960.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#11">11</A>  There is little or no
poverty-induced malnutrition in the U.S.  Persons defined as poor by the U.S.
government have almost the  same average consumption of protein, vitamins, and
other nutrients  as persons in the upper middle class.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#12">12</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Children living in poverty today, far from being  malnourished, actually
grow up to be one inch taller and ten pounds heavier  than the average child of
the same age in the general population in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  late 1950s.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#13">13</A>  The principal nutrition-related
problem facing  poor persons in the U.S. today is obesity, not hunger; the poor
have  a higher rate of obesity than do members of other  socioeconomic groups in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, poor Americans have more housing space and are  less likely to be
overcrowded than is the average citizen in  Western Europe.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#14">14</A>  Nearly all of America's poor live
in decent housing  that is reasonably well-maintained. In fact, nearly 40
percent of  the households defined as poor by the U.S. government actually  own
their own homes.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#15">15</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Behavioral Poverty.</B> Behavioral poverty, by contrast, refers to  a
breakdown in the values and conduct which lead to the  formation of healthy
families, stable personalities, and self-sufficiency.  Behavioral poverty
incorporates a cluster of severe social  pathologies, including eroded work
ethic and dependency, lack of  educational aspiration and achievement, inability
or unwillingness  to control one's children, increased single parenthood and 
illegitimacy, criminal activity, and drug and alcohol abuse. While  material
poverty may be rare in the United States, behavioral poverty  is abundant and
growing at an alarming pace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The core dilemma of the welfare state is that prolific spending  intended to
alleviate material poverty has led to a dramatic  increase in behavioral
poverty. In welfare, as in other government  policies, you get what you pay for.
The current welfare system heavily  subsidizes illegitimacy, divorce, and
non-work. The past 25  years have seen dramatic increases in all three
behaviors. The War  on Poverty may have raised the material standard of living
of a  few Americans, but it has done so at the cost of creating whole  com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  munities where traditional
two-parent families have  vanished, work is rare or nonexistent, and multiple
generations have  grown up dependent on government transfers. The disintegration
of  the family encouraged by the current welfare system has led in turn  to
other severe social problems, particularly a dramatic increase  in crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The anti-marriage and anti-work effects of welfare are simple  and profound.
The current welfare system may be conceptualized  best as a system that offers
each single mother with two children  a &quot;paycheck&quot; of combined
benefits worth an average of  between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the 
state.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#16">16</A>  The mother has a
contract with the government. She will continue to receive  her &quot;paycheck&quot;
as long as she fulfills two conditions:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #1: She must not work.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #2: She must not marry an employed  male.</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#17">17
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the current welfare system provides heavy incentives  for individuals
to work less or leave the labor force entirely and  rely on the taxpayers for
support. Even worse, welfare has made  marriage economically irrational for most
low-income parents; it  has converted the low-income working husband from a 
necessary breadwinner into a net financial  handicap.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#18">18</A>  It has transformed marriage from
a legal institution designed to protect and  nurture children into an
institution that financially penalizes nearly  all low-income parents who enter
into it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare also engenders long-term inter-generational  dependence. Of the over
4.5 million families currently receiving  assistance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  through Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC),  well over half will remain dependent for over ten
years, many for  15 years or longer.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#19">19</A>
 Moreover, dependence passes between  generations; children raised in families
that receive welfare assistance  are three times more likely to be on welfare
than other children  when they become adults.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#20">20</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This inter-generational dependency is a clear indication that  the welfare
system is failing in its goal to lift the poor from poverty  to self-sufficiency
and is trapping many families in a repeating  cycle of debilitating and
self-destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare's Effect on Work</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of the welfare state has coincided with a decline  in labor force
attachment. In 1960, among the lowest income  quintile of the population, nearly
two-thirds of households were headed  by persons who worked.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#21">21</A>  By 1991, this figure had fallen
to  around one-third, and only 11 percent were headed by persons  who worked
full-time throughout the year.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#22">22</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of this decline in employment can be attributed to the  increasing
number of retired elderly households in this income group,  but an equally
important factor is the decline in labor force  participation among non-elderly
heads of households.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For a growing number of poor Americans, the existence of  generous welfare
programs makes not working a reasonable  alternative to long-term employment.
During the late 1960s and early  1970s, social scientists at the Office of
Economic Opportunity  (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to
examine the  effect 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  of welfare benefits on work
effort. The longest running and  most comprehensive of these experiments was
conducted between  1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver and became known as the 
Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or  &quot;SIME/DIME.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#23">23</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME  and similar
experiments conducted in other cities would prove  that generous welfare
benefits did not adversely affect work  effort. Instead, the SIME/DIME
experiment found that each $1.00 of  extra welfare given to low-income persons
reduced labor and  earnings by an average of $0.80.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#24">24</A>  The significant anti-work effects
 of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including  married women,
single mothers, and husbands. They were  particularly pronounced among young
unmarried males; the number of  hours worked per week declined 43 percent for
those who remained  unmarried throughout the experiment and 33 percent for those
 who married.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#25">25</A>  The results of
the SIME/DIME study apply directly  to existing welfare programs: Nearly all
have strong anti-work  effects like those studied in this experiment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent research by Dr. June O'Neill of New York's Baruch  College, now
Director of the Congressional Budget Office,  confirms that higher welfare
benefits increase the number of  individuals who leave the labor force and
enroll in welfare. A 50 percent  increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit
levels was  found to lead to a 75 percent increase both in the number of women 
enrolling in AFDC and in the number of years spent on  AFDC.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#26">26</A>  In other words, increases in
benefit value cause a dramatic  expansion in welfare caseloads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An extremely important research discovery by O'Neill is that  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  AFDC benefits reduce the
employment of young adult men  even though few, if any, of these men benefit
directly from AFDC  payments. High AFDC benefits were found to reduce the 
employment of young adult men in a community by some 50 percent.  High benefit
levels apparently affect the work behavior of young men  in two ways. First,
they reduce the probability of marriage  and thereby reduce the necessity for a
young man to work to support  a family. Second, it is likely that many young
single men who  are boyfriends to single mothers on AFDC indirectly share in 
the mothers' welfare benefits; higher benefits thereby reduce  their need for
work.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#27">27</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Effects of Welfare on Family Structure</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The onset of the War on Poverty coincided with the  disintegration of the
low-income family  the black family in particular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the outset of World War II, the black illegitimate birth rate  was
slightly less than 19 percent. Between 1955 and 1965, it  rose slowly from 22
percent in 1955 to 28 percent in 1965.  Beginning in the late 1960s, however,
the rate of black illegitimate births  skyrocketed  reaching 49 percent in 1975
and 69 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If current trends continue, the black illegitimate birth rate  will reach 75
percent within ten years.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#28">28</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rapid increases in illegitimacy also are occurring among  low-income whites;
the illegitimate birth rate among white high  school dropouts is 48 percent.
Overall, 30 percent of American  children are born to single mothers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Across the nation, the welfare system has all but destroyed  family
structure in low-income communities. Welfare establishes  strong financial
disincentives which effectively block the formation  of intact two-parent
families. Suppose, for example, that a young  man has fathered a child out of
wedlock with his girlfriend. If  this young father abandons his responsibilities
to the mother and  child, government will step in and support the mother and
child  with welfare. If the mother has a second child out of wedlock, as  is
common, average combined benefits will reach around  $13,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the young man does what society believes  is morally
correct (marries the mother and takes a job to support  his family), government
policy takes the opposite course.  Welfare benefits are almost completely
eliminated, and if the young  father makes more than a modest salary, the
federal government  begins taking away his income through taxes. The federal
Welfare  Reform Act of 1988 permits the young father to marry the  mother and
join the family to receive welfare, but only as long as he  does not work. Once
he takes a full-time job to support his family,  welfare benefits are eliminated
and the father's earnings are subject  to taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single  parenthood have become
the conventional &quot;lifestyle option&quot; for raising  children in many
low-income communities. As <I>Washington  Post</I> reporter Leon Dash has shown
in his  book<I> When Children Want Children,</I> most unwed teen mothers
conceive and deliver  their babies deliberately rather than  accidentally.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#29">29</A>  While young women do not
necessarily bear unwanted children in order to  reap windfall profits from
welfare, they are very much aware of the  role 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  welfare will play in supporting
them once a child is born. Thus,  the availability of welfare plays an important
role in influencing  a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single  mothers
contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. Recent  research by Dr.
C.R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found  that half of the increases in
black illegitimacy in recent decades  could be attributed to the effects of
welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#30">30</A>  Research by  Mikhail
Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University  shows that
childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by  6 percent in response to
a 10 percent increase in monthly  welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase
may be as high as 10  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#31">31</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another study of black Americans by Dr. Mark Fossett and Dr.  Jill Kiecolt
finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates  of marriage and greater
numbers of children living in  single-parent homes: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In general, in the Fossett study, an increase of roughly $100 in  the
average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found  to lead to a drop of
more than 15 percent in births within  wedlock among black women ages 20 to 24.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#32">32</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the  University of
Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200  per month in welfare benefits
per family causes the teenage  illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by
150  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#33">33</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dr. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  wide range of other variables
such as income, parental  education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50
percent increase in  the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits leads to
a 43  percent increase in out-of-wedlock births.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in  St. Louis shows
somewhat lower but still strong effects: An  increase in AFDC benefit levels of
$100 per child per month leads  to roughly a 30 percent increase in
out-of-wedlock births to  women age 19 and under.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#35">35</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, high benefits discourage single mothers from  remarrying.
Research by Dr. Robert Hutchens of Cornell University  shows that a 10 percent
increase in AFDC benefits in a state will cause  a decrease in the marriage rate
of all single mothers in the state by  8 percent.<A

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton, at the outset of his presidency, promised &quot;to  end
welfare as we know it.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Administration's  actions and
proposals on welfare contradict the President's  public statements. As recently
as April 1995, President Clinton  stated: &quot;[I]n 1992 I was elected to end
welfare as we know it. That  was part of my New Covenant of opportunity and
responsibility....  And I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform the
country  had ever seen.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#37">37</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Elsewhere, the President has said that &quot;You could not design  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  program that would be too tough
on work for  me.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#38">38</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But the welfare reform bill the President submitted to  Congress had the
following characteristics:
<ul>
<P><li>Virtually no welfare recipient was required to work.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>There were no time limits on welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Only 7 percent of the AFDC caseload was required to work  even by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Even the small number of recipients required to work were  required to do so
only for a few hours per week.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>WORK (the name of the new work program) participants were  to be paid an
effective wage rate of $16.00 per hour.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The bill limited useful work and the filling of government  job openings
with former welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The minimum work requirements were wrongly targeted at  the mothers of
preschool children rather than the mothers of  children at school. (This
provision expanded the welfare system to  provide child care to these mothers of
young children.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The administrative cost alone for running each WORK person  was $4,000.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#39">39</A>
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President's plan, called the Work and Responsibility Act  of 1994,
turned out to be more public relations than reform; if  enacted, like so many
other welfare reform measures of the past,  it 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  would do nothing but forestall
serious systemic change  of America's welfare system. When the rhetoric is
removed,  the Clinton Administration plan represents little more than a 
continuing rapid expansion of the current destructive  system.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#40">40</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress passed a significant reform of  America's failed welfare
system based on three themes:
</P>
<P>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> the growth of illegitimacy;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Limiting</b> the elements of reform in the legislation.
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among the many elements of reform in the measure, seven  are crucial:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>1) The bill ends the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC  spending, with
states that increase their welfare caseloads no longer  rewarded by an automatic
increase in federal funding. This  change imposes a fundamental fiscal
discipline at the state level that  is essential to real reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>2) The bill establishes a family cap. Mothers already enrolled  in AFDC will
not receive an automatic increase in federal benefits  if they give birth to an
additional child while on welfare.  (However, states will be permitted to enact
legislation to &quot;opt out&quot; of this  requirement.)
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states  which reduce
out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>4) The bill provides $75 million per year for a new block grant  for
abstinence education.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill  establishes serious
work requirements for welfare recipients. Up to 40  percent of the AFDC caseload
will be required to work or become  self-sufficient by the year 2002. Unlike all
previous work  requirements in the AFDC program, those in this legislation are
real.  Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to 
perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a  &quot;pay
after performance&quot; rule. Recipients will not receive benefits  until the
required work has been performed satisfactorily. If they fail  to perform the
required hours of work, benefits will be reduced  pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>6) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of workfare is to  reduce
welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to  maximize the number of welfare
recipients in make-work public service  jobs. It recognizes that the best road
to self-sufficiency is to reduce  the number of persons who become dependent on
welfare in the  first place. Unlike President Clinton's plan, which rewards
states  for expanding welfare addiction, Congress for the first time focuses  on
rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who  get hooked on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>7) The bill establishes a firm time limit for receipt of  federal AFDC
funds; an individual may receive federal AFDC aid for  not more than five years.
States may exempt 15 percent of the  AFDC 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  caseload from this limit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President vetoed this welfare reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Relief for Families. </B>In tandem with comprehensive  welfare
reform, Members of Congress have recognized the need to  reward work, especially
among lower and middle-income  families<B>. </B>
</P>
<P>Congress thus enacted a $500-per-child tax credit in its  balanced budget
package. For the average family with two children, that is  a significant break,
as <a href="welf_t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
</B>The 104th Congress affirmed the continuing expansion of the EITC enacted in 
previous years, passing a budget which would have raised the basic  EITC rate
for a working family with two children from 36 percent  of earnings in 1995 to
40 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress correctly rescinded Clinton's 1993 expansion of  EITC coverage to
individuals who were not parents. Single persons  who work full-time at the
minimum wage automatically have  incomes above the poverty level; expanding the
EITC to include single  persons therefore was both expensive and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress did change the EITC formula for parents with  children so that the
value of the credit would phase down more quickly  as family earnings rose above
$18,000 per year. However, parents  in this income range also would be eligible
for the new  $500-per-child tax credit. Overall, under the congressional plan,
95  percent of parents with children would see their incomes rise.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Rebuilding the Good Society.</B> The reform of America's  welfare system
should be animated by a broader social vision.  Candidates running for the
presidency and the Congress should be clear,  in this area, about what kind of
society they wish to see for  current and future generations of Americans. This
vision of the better  life should not be confined simply to the need to reform
public  assistance to low-income Americans. It extends to the broader  society.
The chief object of conservative social policy should be  nothing less than the
restoration and support of the traditional  two-parent family. The traditional
family is the foundation of American  society: the principal social institution
by which the work ethic,  self-discipline, intellectual motivation, and moral
character are  passed on to the next generation. When the family is weakened,
the  nation is weakened. (For a discussion of how to make specific changes  to
improve America's social order, see Chapter 6, &quot;Social  Breakdown.&quot;)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades the federal government has pursued policies  which promote the
collapse of the family. Vast changes are required in  a wide range of social and
welfare policies. These changes  should include reducing the government's
financial burden on  middle-class families with children; reforming welfare to
control costs  and require work; promoting policies to reduce illegitimacy  and
thereby improve the quality of life for America's children;  reforming divorce
law and strengthening marriage; and revitalizing  the institutions of civil
society.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The traditional family is the original department of health,  education, and
welfare. But for several decades the government has  pursued policies which
discourage marriage and make it difficult  for the traditional family to carry
out its functions. In 1950, the  median family of four paid just 3 percent of
its income to the  federal government in taxes. Today that figure has risen to
24  percent; when state and local taxes are thrown in, the total is even 
higher: 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Welfare to Require Work and Control Costs.</B> A  considerable
portion of those taxes supports a welfare system which,  with its huge costs and
harmful consequences, requires immediate  and drastic reform. Since most of the
funding for the current system  is provided at the federal level, it follows
that the basic structure  of reform should occur at the national level. Reform
should  promote individual responsibility by converting welfare from a  one-way
handout into a system in which recipients are expected to  contribute something
for temporary aid received. In addition, it must  be undergirded by firm
budgetary controls on the growth of  future spending. Welfare bureaucracies are
prolific in inventing new  programs which allegedly promote self-sufficiency but
 accomplish nothing or actually draw more people into dependence.  Without
definite limits on the amount of money flowing into this  system, such
counterproductive &quot;reforms&quot; are difficult to block.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the  War on
Poverty has been borne largely by the middle class,  especially parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when  they have married, have put off having
children, reducing the  number 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  of those they do raise.
Ironically, even as it discourages child  rearing by traditional middle-class
families, government  aggressively subsidizes child rearing by never-married
women who  generally are ill-prepared to act as parents. The results of this 
disastrous policy are all too apparent. Any government policy which  places
punitive and crippling financial burdens on traditional  two-parent families
while subsidizing illegitimacy is a recipe for eventual  social collapse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specific policies needed include the following: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cut taxes on middle-class families with children.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The government must realize that healthy families are the  foundation of a
successful society; it must seek to strengthen marriage  as the crucial
institution in which future generations of  Americans will be raised. The most
obvious step it can take in this regard is  to reduce dramatically the current
crippling tax burden it places  on young working and middle-class parents with
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress  and vetoed by
President Clinton is only a first step. This tax  credit should be enacted now
and followed in the near future by  larger tax cuts for families with children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cap the growth of welfare spending. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No matter how frequently policymakers supposedly end  welfare, the costs
continue to rise. Welfare absorbed around 1.5 percent  of GNP when Lyndon
Johnson launched the War on Poverty in  1965; it rose to over 5 percent by 1993.
With a $324 billion price  tag, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  welfare spending now amounts to
$8,300 for each poor person  in the U.S. Worse, Congressional Budget Office
figures show  total welfare costs rising to $500 billion, about 6 percent of
GNP,  by 1999. To the Clinton Administration, ending welfare has  meant spending
even more.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The long history of bogus welfare reforms, all of which  promised to save
money but did not, leads to one obvious conclusion:  The only way to limit the
growth of welfare spending is to do just  that: limit the growth of welfare
spending. The entitlement nature  of federal welfare programs which permits
unlimited  automatic spending increases should be repealed, and the future
growth  of federal means-tested welfare spending (excluding medical  programs)
should be limited to 3 percent per  annum.41  Most non-medical means-tested
programs should be folded into a single  welfare block grant to the states, with
funding permitted to increase  at 3 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By slowing the outpouring from the federal welfare spigot,  this spending
cap would gradually reduce the subsidizing of  dysfunctional behavior:
dependency, non-work, and illegitimacy. It  would send a warning signal to state
welfare bureaucracies, most  of which, cushioned by a steady and increasing flow
of federal  funds, have found no reason to grapple with the tough and 
controversial policies needed to reduce illegitimacy and dependency. With a  cap
on future federal funds, state governments for the first time  would be forced
to adopt innovative and aggressive policies to reduce  the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish serious workfare. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although liberals often talk about requiring welfare recipients  to work,
existing welfare law makes it extremely difficult for  states to require this.
Similarly, the welfare &quot;reforms&quot; proposed by  President Clinton would
have made it impossible for states to  operate efficient work programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should establish serious work requirements for  able-bodied
recipients in federal welfare programs. The key to  successful workfare is the
number of welfare recipients who are required  to participate. Real reform would
require all fathers in the  AFDC-UP program to perform 40 hours of community
service work  per week. It also would require able-bodied single persons in the 
food stamp program to work. Finally, half of all single mothers  on AFDC should
be required to perform community service for  benefits by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a serious workfare program, recipients would be required  to look for
private-sector jobs. If a recipient cannot find a  private-sector job, he or she
should be required to perform  community service in exchange for welfare
benefits according to a &quot;pay  for performance&quot; rule. Under a &quot;pay
for performance&quot; system,  the recipient would not receive benefits until
the required work  had been performed satisfactorily; if the recipient failed to
perform  the required hours of work, welfare benefits would be reduced 
pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of serious workfare is to reduce welfare dependence  and caseloads,
not to maximize the number of recipients in  make-work public service jobs. A
properly designed system must be based  on an understanding that the most
important effect of any work  requirement is to separate recipients who truly
need assistance  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  cause they cannot find employment
from those who do not but  are willing to take a free handout if it is offered.
Thus, a properly  designed workfare program has its greatest impact by 
dramatically shrinking the number of individuals who apply for welfare in  the
first place. Serious workfare recognizes that the best road to  self-sufficiency
is to reduce the number of persons who become  dependent and &quot;get hooked&quot;
on welfare initially.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish sensible workfare priorities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Workfare programs should be efficient and low cost.  Workfare should be
established first for those who have the least  justification for being out of
the labor force: able-bodied, non-elderly  single persons on welfare, followed
by fathers in two-parent families  on welfare and absent fathers who fail to pay
child  support.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#42">42</A>  After workfare
has been put in operation for the preceding groups,  single mothers on AFDC who
do not have pre-school children should  be required to work.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High day care expenses mean that putting a single mother with  a young child
to work in a community service program  costs roughly two to three times as much
as requiring a mother with  an older child to work. Because work programs
inevitably  operate within fixed budgets, an emphasis on workfare participation 
by mothers with younger children leads to a sharp reduction in  the total number
of persons who will be required to work. One  little-understood aspect of the
debate is that liberals often attempt  to focus workfare programs on mothers
with very young  children precisely because they understand this quickly soaks
up  available funds and thereby limits the number of recipients required to 
participate. Liberal welfare advocates also try to undermine the  gen
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  eral concept of workfare by
claiming that all workfare  programs cost more than they save; they promote the
least  cost-effective programs (that is, those with a heavy emphasis on mothers 
with young children) precisely for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Around half of AFDC single mothers have no pre-school  children under age
five. Workfare should be imposed on single  mothers with children under age five
only after most mothers with  older children have been required to work.
However, if an  AFDC mother gave birth to another child after her enrollment in 
AFDC, that should not exempt her from work requirements even if  the child is
under age five. This rule is needed to prevent  mothers from having additional
children to escape the work requirement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Recognize the limits of job training. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A perennial panacea in the welfare debate is that education and  job
training will enable single mothers to obtain good jobs and  become
self-sufficient. Unfortunately, despite over three decades of  experience,
government-run training programs have failed to raise  the wage rates of welfare
recipients by more than a tiny amount.  For example, the U.S. Department of
Labor in 1993 completed a  controlled scientific evaluation of its massive Job
Training  Partnership Act (JTPA) program. This evaluation showed that the 
average hourly wage of female trainees was raised by 3.4 percent;  the hourly
wages of males were not increased at  all.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The failure of government training programs is especially  salient given the
very low cognitive ability levels of many welfare  mothers. A recent study by
Child Trends, Inc., finds that mothers in  the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program have  signifi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  cantly lower math and verbal
abilities than other women of  the same ethnic group who are not enrolled in
welfare  programs. When all U.S. women are ranked according to basic math and 
verbal skills, over half of welfare mothers are found to have  cognitive skill
levels placing them in the bottom 20 percent of the  overall population. The
study states: &quot;The average aptitude or  achievement scores of welfare
mothers are significantly below the  mean of even the lowest of the occupational
 classes.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#45">45</A>  Government can do
little if anything to alter these cognitive skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The very low cognitive abilities of welfare mothers, coupled  with the
impotence of government educational and training  programs and the cost of child
care, underscore the futility of  reform schemes aimed narrowly at making unwed
mothers employed  and self-sufficient. What is needed is more fundamental change
 aimed at reducing illegitimacy and restoring marriage. To repeat the  basic
historical lesson: Raising children is a difficult and  expensive task which
generally requires the efforts of the mother and  father bound by the commitment
of marriage. It is very difficult for  a single parent to find the time and
emotional resources needed  to raise a child while also working to support the
family. The  importance of marriage and the contribution of both parents is 
intensified in the case of parents with low personal skills and  earning
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The well-being of American children requires policy changes  that not only
will reduce illegitimacy and promote marriage, but  also will encourage
potential parents to defer child-bearing until  both the mother and the father
have acquired the education, job  skills, and personal maturity needed to
support a family and nurture  their children properly. Above all, it is
imperative to eliminate the  wide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  array of programs which subsidize
and encourage young,  poorly educated girls to have children out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Replace food stamps with commodities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major historic expansion of the welfare state occurred when  the food
stamp program replaced older aid programs which  distributed food commodities
directly to the poor. The current food  stamp program gives individuals food
coupons which they can use  to purchase food in stores. Unlike food commodities,
food  coupons can be sold on the black market and converted into cash. 
Replacing the older food commodities programs with food coupons was  a serious
mistake that further encouraged rapid increases in  welfare dependence and
illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should reverse this mistake. Families on AFDC and  other persons
receiving food stamps (excluding the elderly and  disabled) should be given a
carefully selected basket of food commodities  in lieu of food stamp coupons.
Each basket should be carefully  balanced to provide the proper levels of
proteins, calories,  vitamins, and minerals for the family or individual
receiving aid. This  policy can ensure that no family receiving aid will be
malnourished  or hungry. It also can be operated at a lower cost than the 
current program. Moreover, this policy would eliminate food stamp  fraud by
restricting the beneficiary's ability to sell food stamps on  the black market;
there would be little or no black market for the  donated commodities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More important, replacing food stamps with commodities  would reduce
dependence and out-of-wedlock births by reducing  the overall attractiveness of
welfare. Assuming that substituting  food 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  commodities for food stamps would
reduce the consumer  &quot;utility&quot; of food benefits by a third and the &quot;utility&quot;
of the overall  AFDC/food stamp benefit package by 15 percent, it also could 
reduce illegitimate births by more than 5 percent and the AFDC  caseload by over
20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Limit cash benefits to young unmarried mothers. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It has been a tragic mistake for the government to pay money  to 14-year-old
girls on condition that they have children out of  wedlock. The government
should begin to address the  illegitimacy problem by ending its disastrous
policy of giving direct AFDC  and food stamp benefits to unmarried young
mothers. This almost  certainly would lead to a sharp and substantial drop in
illegitimacy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today's welfare system mainly involves failed attempts to pick  up the
pieces for an ever-increasing number of individuals who  have violated the above
rules. But from the perspective of society  and the child, to have a baby you
cannot support either financially  or psychologically is profoundly
irresponsible. Government  policy not only must stop subsidizing and promoting
such  irresponsible behavior, but must actively discourage it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Serious welfare reform must focus on the root behavioral  problems of
illegitimacy and divorce, not merely on the superficial  symptom of welfare
dependence. Despite rhetoric pledging to &quot;end  welfare as we know it,&quot;
President Clinton is unwilling to take the  serious steps needed to deal with
the crisis of illegitimacy. The  Clinton Administration seeks to devise schemes
to help individuals  leave welfare rather than to reduce the self-destructive
behavior that  led to dependence in the first place. This approach is
self-deluding.  No 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  array of government programs is
going to make a  20-year-old woman who has had one or two children out of
wedlock  self-sufficient. Nor, despite her best efforts, is that single mother
likely  to be able to provide a truly healthy emotional environment for  her
children as they develop.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By paying young women to have children out of wedlock,  the present welfare
system encourages them in a course of action  that in the long term proves
self-defeating to the mothers and  harmful to both the children and society.
Placing millions of single  mothers in work and training programs will have
little positive effect  on society as long as the illegitimate birth rate
remains over 30  percent. Congress must go to the heart of the dependency
problem  by seeking to reduce the number of illegitimate births. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the same time, government should not abandon all aid to  children born
out of wedlock; federal AFDC and food stamp  funds currently given directly to
unwed mothers under age 21 should  be converted into block grants to the states.
State governments  could use the funds to develop innovative policies for
assisting  teenagers who continue to have children out of wedlock. Such policies
 could include providing in-kind benefits, promoting adoption and  orphanages,
or supporting the mothers in tightly supervised  group homes; but federal funds
should no longer be used to provide  direct cash welfare benefits to teen
mothers. The limitation on  benefits should apply to all children born to unwed
mothers age  21 and under one year or more after the date of enactment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Do not provide increased AFDC and food stamp benefits to  mothers who
bear additional children while already enrolled in  the AFDC program. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 --></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the current welfare system, if a mother enrolled in  AFDC bears
additional children, she receives an automatic increase  in AFDC and food stamp
benefits. No other family in America  receives an automatic increase in its
income by having more  children. There is no reason to provide expanded welfare
benefits  to single mothers who have additional illegitimate children  while
already dependent on welfare. A limitation of this sort already  has been put
into effect in the state of New Jersey by Democratic  Assemblyman Wayne Bryant.
Evidence from controlled  scientific experiments designed to determine its
effects show a 10  percent decrease in illegitimate births to mothers on AFDC as
a result  of the family cap.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#46">46
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require the establishment of paternity for children  receiving AFDC. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current law requires that an AFDC mother make a &quot;good  faith&quot;
effort to identify the father of her child in order to receive  AFDC. This law
is ignored. The government should require, for  children born prospectively,
that the mother identify the father in order  to receive any federally funded
welfare aid.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#47">47</A>  Exceptions to this
 rule in a few hardship cases could be made, but they should not  exceed 10
percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Modern DNA testing permits determination of a child's real  father with
absolute confidence. Once the mother has identified the  father and paternity
has been established, the father can be required  to pay child support to offset
welfare costs. If the father claims  he cannot pay any child support because he
cannot find a job,  the government may require that he perform community service
 to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  fulfill his obligation.
Experiments with this approach in  Wisconsin have led to surprising increases in
the ability of absent fathers  to locate private-sector employment and pay child
support.  Moreover, the definite expectation among young men that they will  be
identified and required to pay child support for their children  may put an end
to the ethos in some communities where young  men assert their masculinity by
fathering children they have no  intention of supporting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage state-based &quot;faith and families&quot; programs. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The &quot;faith and families&quot; program created by Mississippi  Governor
Kirk Fordice is one of the most innovative and interesting  welfare reforms in
the U.S. today. This program seeks to link single  mothers on AFDC with church
congregations throughout the state,  placing at least one welfare family under
the tutelage of each  church. The congregation effectively becomes the case
worker for the  welfare mother, providing mentoring, moral authority, life
skills  training, and contact with employment opportunities. The  recipient
continues to receive her welfare check from the government  bureaucracy, but
most other aspects of managing the case are  under church control. The program
also is voluntary in that any  recipient can choose to have her case handled by
welfare bureaucrats  rather than a church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Striking a theme which would have been common in earlier  generations but
has been painfully absent in American discourse  for over half a century,
Governor Fordice has declared that &quot;God,  not government, will be the
savior of welfare recipients.&quot;  This  new policy should be copied in other
states.

<P><B>Reduce government welfare by increasing private-sector charity. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is widespread recognition that government welfare  has failed  indeed,
that government is the least effective institution  in aiding the poor. Yet,
each year, hundreds of billions of  dollars taken forcibly from the paychecks of
Americans are spent on  government welfare programs in which the people no
longer have  confidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Real welfare reform will require rechanneling a major portion  of current
funding into private secular and religious charities  rather than government
programs. Legislation introduced in 1995  by Representatives Jim Kolbe (R-AZ)

to  demonstrate which was the most effective in aiding the poor. Similar 
legislation

their children?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Nothing punishes single parents and their children more  than the
current welfare system. For millions of children and their  parents, this system
is the proverbial free ticket to a bus going  nowhere. The reason: It is riddled
with perverse incentives that  discourage work and marriage while encouraging
illegitimate  birth and long-term dependency. Precisely because single-parent 
family life is much harder on the children, as well as their mothers and  the
broader society, it is no kindness for government to make  either single
parenthood or long-term dependency easier and more  common. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the perverse incentives of the system, millions of  parents and their
children cannot escape to a better life, but will be  locked instead into more
of the same. It is a condition that not only  undermines their upward economic
mobility and eventual  independence, but also robs them of hope for the future
and reinforces  spiritual despair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Conservative welfare reform aims to discourage single  mothers from having
more children out of wedlock while helping  them through the transition to a
life in which it is economically  rational to marry or get a job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress want to cut welfare?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress are not proposing to cut  welfare.
Under the Republican proposals aggregate welfare spending  on non-medical
programs will grow at roughly 4 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress generally oppose serious welfare reform  and, as
evidenced during the debate on school lunch programs, do  not even favor
reducing the rate of welfare spending. Total  welfare spending in the United
States is $324 billion, 72 percent of it  federal and 28 percent of it state
spending. Moreover, nine-tenths  of all state welfare spending amounts to a
state contribution to  federal programs. At the current rate of spending,
assuming nothing  is changed, the United States will be spending $500 billion on
 welfare by the year 1999, or 6 percent of the gross national  product (GNP). To
put this in perspective, at the current rate,  taxpayers will be shelling out $2
in welfare spending for every $1 we  now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives in Congress simply want to impose some  discipline on welfare
spending, just as they do in other areas of  federal spending. They are prepared
to let already high levels of  welfare spending grow, but only at some
reasonable rate, not at the  explosive rate at which it has been growing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But didn't conservatives in Congress propose to cut  school lunch and
women, infants, and children (WIC) programs last year?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Congressional appropriators last year attempted to convert  the
federal school lunch and breakfast programs into a block  grant, which would
grow at 4.5 percent per year. Liberals  complained that the original baseline
for growth in the program was 5.1  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  cent, and thus that reducing the
growth in spending amounted to  a &quot;cut.&quot;  It is patently dishonest to
call a growth in spending a  cut, but even with this modest change, Congress
still would be  wasting federal funds by providing school lunch subsidies to 
middle-class families and even to the children of millionaires instead of 
targeting them exclusively to poor children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As for WIC, it was not cut. It was folded into a block grant with  a few
other programs. The money available for WIC, like the  money available for
school lunches, was to increase. Incredibly, under  the traditional WIC program,
benefits were available to families  earning up to $28,000 per year even though
a family in that  income range pays about $6,000 per year in federal taxes. 
Conservative policy for middle-income families is not to give them welfare 
benefits, but to cut their taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't spending reductions in existing federal welfare  programs and
block grants jeopardize poor families? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Few, if any, welfare programs have operated as expected,  so poor
families have not benefited as expected. The largest  federal program, Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC),  was designed in 1935 to support widows
and orphans. Only 1.5  percent of the beneficiaries today are widows and
orphans. Instead,  AFDC has served as the financial mainstay of single
parenthood  among low-income persons. Likewise, there are nine different federal
 jobs and training programs for low-income persons, costing an  estimated $5.3
billion.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#48">48</A>  After three decades of
federal job  training programs, the wage rates of beneficiaries have hardly been
 affected. A Labor Department study of the impact of the Job  Training
Partnership Act, for example, showed that female  trainees' 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  wages increased by a mere 3.4
percent and that male  trainees' wages did not increase at all. Five recent
scientific studies of  federal jobs programs for poor people showed that none of
 them worked. Few federal jobs programs ever lead to real,  permanent jobs in
the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By combining dozens of federal welfare programs into  block grants to the
states, eliminating tens of thousands of pages of  federal regulations, and
letting governors and state legislators  take direct responsibility and do what
they think is best for their  communities, welfare reform can serve low-income
people more  efficiently. States and local communities, working with  dedicated
people in private organizations in these communities, are likely  to have the
best ideas about what works in preventing teen  pregnancy or in setting up day
care and jobs programs to help lift poor  people out of poverty and dependency.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives want to lift low-income families out of  poverty,
how do they propose to help them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to keep a mother and her children out of  poverty is
to help make sure they have a working father with a regular  paycheck who comes
home every night. Right now, if a young  man marries the mother of his child and
makes anything over $6.50  per hour, we tax his  income. For persons currently
on welfare,  this does not encourage either marriage or upward economic
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But by making serious tax changes, particularly by giving  low-income
families generous tax relief, a conservative social  policy would reward work,
increase disposable family income, and  help keep families together. Under
Representative Dick Armey's  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  posal to replace the current tax
code with a flat tax, for  example, any family of four with an income of $33,000
per year or  less would pay no income tax at all.49  Moreover, by eliminating 
outdated penalties on savings and investment, conservative tax  policies would
stimulate more investment and economic growth,  and thus create more real jobs,
open up new opportunities, and  generate higher wages for family breadwinners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives in Congress want to help low-income  working
families, why didn't they support President Clinton's family  tax relief
proposal rather than pass a balanced budget plan that  would gut the popular
Earned Income Tax Credit and raise taxes on  families earning less than $30,000?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Even after changing the Earned Income Tax Credit, the  Balanced
Budget Act of 1995, with its $500-per-child tax  credit, would benefit 5.4
million more low-income working families  with children than the Clinton
Administration tax proposal with  its $300-per-child tax credit. In fact, the
congressional proposal,  vetoed by President Clinton, would allow a low-income
family  to take a $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the  full
value of the EITC on top of the child credit. Under the  Clinton plan, a
low-income family would have to deduct EITC  benefits from income tax before
taking the less generous $300-per-child  tax credit. Thus, a family with two
children would have to  earn $24,000 a year before becoming eligible for the
Clinton  credit. Worse, because the Clinton tax credit is available only to 
families with children under the age of 13, families are denied tax relief  for
children precisely when the cost of raising them becomes  even more expensive.
Under the Clinton tax credit plan, 2.8  million children in families earning
less than $30,000 per year would  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  denied eligibility for tax
relief. Under the congressional plan,  a family would be eligible for a more
generous tax credit at  roughly $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What steps can the government take to reduce illegitimacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> First, unlike age, disability, or veterans status,  illegitimacy
should not be the basis of a legal entitlement to a  government check. Unwed
mothers can and should be assisted in other  ways, including the establishment
of group homes for unwed mothers  or maternity homes. Young men and women may be
entitled to  a mistake, but taxpayers cannot afford to subsidize further 
mistakes through automatic increases in benefits to women who continue  to have
additional children while on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, sexual abstinence programs should be incorporated  into welfare
reform measures, particularly at the state level. The  data show that such
programs work,<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#50">50</A> much as the Just
Say No  campaigns against illegal drugs in the 1980s worked. Teenagers are  not
stupid. They can see the difference between a young man's  lifelong commitment
to the mother and their baby and the  momentary enjoyment of sexual pleasure
with life-changing consequences  and without the commitment of marriage. All the
proposals to  make marriage more attractive also help to reduce illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Third, it is time to get serious about cracking down on  statutory rape. In
a significant percentage of illegitimacy cases, the  mother is well below the
age of consent and the father is in his  mid-twenties. It is past time that such
adult males, taking advantage of  teenage girls, face charges of rape.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Fourth, toughen child support enforcement. Policymakers  should inflict
financial pain on men who sire children and then  abandon the mothers. Men
should be made to take responsibility for  the upbringing of their children.
Tough enforcement of child  support also helps get the message across that the
costs of  illegitimacy must be borne by the father as much as by the child and
mother.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But don't congressional conservatives want to consign  poor children
to orphanages?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> For neglected, unwanted, or physically or sexually abused 
children, state or local authorities might determine that an  orphanage is not
an unreasonable solution. In some cases, it is the only  viable option. And,
regardless of the negative images conjured up by  liberal opponents, sound
policy should include this possibility.  While Hillary Rodham Clinton ridiculed
the concept as &quot;absurd,&quot;  under persistent questioning from
Representative Bill Archer of  Texas, Chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, HHS  Secretary Donna Shalala admitted that even under the Clinton 
Administration welfare plan, orphanages would be an option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't conservatives expecting too much of private  charities when
the government cuts back on the spending increases in  social services? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. First, under real welfare reform, with new 
incentives to work and get off the welfare rolls, there will be a drop in  the
welfare rolls even as there is a simultaneous increase in total  welfare
spending. In other words, there will be more money,  rather than less, for those
in need. Second, under the congressional  block grant approach, state and local
governments will work  directly 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  with local charitable
organizations, not only to provide social  services, but also to help poor
people become self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>After decades of painful experience, Congress and the federal  bureaucracy
must admit that neither they nor the programs they  have designed over the past
half century have been effective in  reducing the welfare rolls, curbing
illegitimacy, or making  low-income Americans economically independent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beyond the promise of welfare reform, Congress can assist  private charities
even more directly in helping the poor. Senator  Daniel Coats (R-IN), for
example, has introduced a bill that would allow  a tax credit of as much as
$1,000 for donations to charities that  directly help the needy poor. This will
increase the ability of  charities to help these people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't conservative cuts in social programs increase the  number of
hungry children?  HHS says that over 1 million people will  be thrown into
poverty. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The HHS study is flawed. It assumes that the conservative 
congressional reforms, just like the several previous  and  notoriously
unsuccessful  liberal attempts to &quot;end welfare as we know  it,&quot; will
fail and that welfare rolls will continue to increase at about  3 percent per
annum. But there are dramatic differences, both in  assumptions and in policies,
between liberal and conservative  welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past, liberals have attempted to make the welfare  system work. For
the future, conservatives want to make welfare  recipients work. Conservative
policies can assume a decrease in the  wel
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  fare rolls precisely because they
introduce serious work  requirements into welfare reform. For example, in
dealing with  married AFDC families, states that have introduced serious work 
requirements for welfare recipients have registered significant drops  in the
welfare rolls ranging from 50 to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In speaking of the HHS study, American Enterprise Institute  Senior Fellow
Ben J. Wattenberg remarked that &quot;The assumptions  of these studies
strangely do not take into account the very purpose  of the bill  to encourage
young people to have children after  marriage, not before, thus sharply
improving children's economic  circumstances. Studies that assume welfare reform
will not work  are the work of those who believe that welfare reform will not 
work. Hence, the studies are useless and  misleading.&quot;<A

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES 
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On October 15, 1995, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD),  was mugged outside
her home in Baltimore. Robert Eugene  Perlie, charged with the crime, was on
probation for possession of  cocaine and resisting arrest. He also had been
convicted in the past  for other drug offenses, as well as for theft and
insurance fraud.  Moreover, at the time of the inceident, Perlie was scheduled
for  four separate trials on charges of illegal transportion of a handgun, 
violation of probation, drug possession, and malicious destruction  and theft.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#1">1</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Mikulski mugging represents in microcosm both the  problem and the
politics of crime in America: A relatively small,  hard-core group of repeat
offenders commit most crimes, especially  violent crimes. Federal lawmakers talk
about &quot;getting tough on crime&quot;  and then pass laws that affect only
the tiny minority of  hard-core criminals that come under federal jurisdiction,
leaving the  vast majority unaffected. Press releases tout federal efforts, 
even though career criminals remain on the streets. The public  becomes more
cynical and more alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should explain the short-term solution  to America's
crime problem: putting repeat offenders behind  bars 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  and keeping them there. This is
not the whole solution, but it is  the essential first step in ridding America
of the menace of  violent crime. And the evidence shows that it works. This
means,  however, that federal lawmakers must stop posturing for the  cameras and
recognize that, because most violent street crime is under  the jurisdiction of
state and local governments, most of the changes  in policy need to be made at
the state and local levels. The  President and Congress should review all
current federal laws,  determine which impinge upon or undermine the authority
of state and  local law enforcement, and repeal them.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#2">2</A>  The President and  Congress can and
should provide leadership and policy assistance, but  the real solution to the
problem of street crime lies at the state  and local levels.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the long term, lawmakers at all levels must recognize that  the real
reason for America's decades-long crime wave is not  poverty, as some have
believed. Nor is it race, as others have intimated. It  is family breakdown.
Nothing could be clearer from the social  research than that fatherless children
 from whatever  socioeconomic or racial background  are the most likely to
commit  violent crimes as teenagers and adults. The rising rate of  illegitimacy
means that teenage crime also will continue to rise. This  point must be driven
home, repeatedly, and long-range economic  and social policies that encourage
the formation of stable,  two-parent families must be developed. At the same
time, Americans  must face the fact that some existing government policies 
encourage illegitimacy and family breakup. To curb crime, these  anti-family
policies must be ended.

</P>
<P>Public awareness and state and local efforts already are  affecting the
crime rate, which is dropping in many states and  localities. According to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's 
<I>Uniform Crime Reporting</I> figures, there was a 1 percent decrease in  &quot;serious
crime,&quot; a measure of violent crime and property crime, reported  by law
enforcement agencies for the first six months of  1995.3  It is important to
realize that the recent decline is a reduction from  a huge statistical base,
and that much violent crime is not even  reported to law enforcement agencies.
That is why America's  crime rates are still unacceptably high. For example,
according to  the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a crime occurs every 2 
seconds:<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#4">4</A>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While crime rates have declined somewhat this past year, they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  still very high compared with
1960. In 1960, there were 160  violent crimes for every 100,000 Americans; by
1994, there were  715 for every 100,000 Americans, down slightly from 1993. 
Overall, there were 23,310 murders, 102,100 rapes, 618,820 robberies,  and
1,119,950 aggravated assaults in 1994. Since 1990, violent  and property crime
have declined by 2.2 percent and 8.5 percent  respectively, per 100,000
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While still devastating in its impact on American society, the  recent
downturn is both welcome and, according to John  DiIulio, Professor of Politics
and Public Affairs at Princeton  University, &quot;can be explained in part by
policy-driven law enforcement  efforts that capitalize on community
crime-fighting initiatives and  take the bad guys off the streets.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#5">5</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives therefore should welcome the debate over  crime. Liberals, on
the other hand, continue to look to social programs  to reduce crime even though
these programs have proved  ineffective. The fact is that recent success in
reducing crime is largely  attributable to conservative policies which emphasize
tougher and  more effective law enforcement and incarceration of violent 
criminals. Crime is still a politically powerful issue throughout the  nation,
and in few areas are the political lines clearer. The  American people have had
enough; they are demanding tough,  sweeping changes that will slash the crime
rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The effectiveness of good police work and extended  incarceration of
hardened criminals is beyond dispute. Crime rates would  drop even more
dramatically if more state and local officials  initiated tougher and more
effective law enforcement on America's  streets, as Professor DiIulio suggests,
and made violent criminals  serve 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  longer prison terms. Examples:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Jacksonville, Florida. State Attorney Harry L. Shorenstein  beefed up his
prosecutorial team in 1992, got tough with dangerous  juvenile offenders, and
started to prosecute them as adults and  send them to prison. The result: By
1994, Shorenstein's program  had sent hundreds of juveniles to jail. With fewer
young criminals  on the streets, arrests of juveniles declined 30 percent, and
the  number of juveniles arrested for weapons offenses fell by 41  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Houston, Texas.</B> Police Chief Sam Nuchia started a &quot;citizens
 patrol program&quot; to beef up the city's increased police presence. The 
result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal  activities to
the police, arrests have increased, and police response  to emergencies has
improved, increasing the productivity of the  police and the safety of Houston's
citizens.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#7">7</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Oxnard, California.</B> By using sophisticated crime analysis and  an
advanced gang-tracking computer data base, and by using  a telemarketing
computer system to issue crime alerts to residents  in high-crime areas, police
have helped to reduce violent crime by  38 percent, including a 60 percent drop
in the murder rate.  Oxnard has reduced crime to its lowest level since the 
1960s.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>New York City, New York.</B> Taking over the police department  in
January 1994, Commissioner William J. Bratton declared a  real war on crime,
promising in Churchillian fashion to &quot;fight for  every house in the city;
we will fight for every street; we will fight  for every block. And we will win.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">9</A>  Bratton took command of  the city's
demoralized 38,000-member police force, held the 76  precinct police commanders
directly accountable for their  perfor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  mance in decreasing the crime rate
in their precincts,  computerized the precinct data system to track the crime
problem daily, and  dismissed high-level police officials who failed to get in
tune with  his tough new program.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#10">10</A>
 In 1994, while major felonies  nationwide fell by 2 percent, in New York City
they fell by 12 percent. In  the first nine months of 1995, they fell another 18
 percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#11">11</A>  Over the past two
years, declines in most major felonies, including an  almost 40 percent drop in
murder, have been dramatic.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>But first-rate police work should be combined with a serious  sentencing
policy for violent criminals. According to  Professor DiIulio, &quot;Not
surprisingly, therefore, studies show that from  1980 to 1992 the 10 states
where incarceration increased the most  saw violent crime decrease by 8 percent.
In the 10 states with the  lowest increases, violent crime soared 51  percent.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#12">12</A>  If more state and local officials
pursued such policies, more of America's streets  and homes would be much safer
places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should encourage such efforts at  every opportunity,
and not just because it will do well at the polls.  While recent reductions in
crime rates are encouraging, the  statistical base of violence upon which those
rates are calculated from  year to year is huge. The tidal wave of crime, which
began in the  1960s, continues to roll across America. During the 1960s alone, 
crime rates more than doubled (see Tables <a href="crime_t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="crime_t2.gif">2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's violent crime rate soared 47 percent from 1975 to  1994, rising
from 487.8 to 716.0 per 100,000  inhabitants.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#13">13</A>(see <a href="crime_1.gif">Chart 1</a>)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan  commission
chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  Heritage Foundation Distinguished
Fellow William J.  Bennett, over 400,000 Americans have been murdered since 1977
  almost seven times the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam  War.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>Most ominously, if the present disintegration of family and  social life
continues, Americans will see an unprecedented  acceleration of the already
horrendous levels of juvenile criminal  violence. Current data trends clearly
indicate that: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Violent crime among juveniles has soared by about 300  percent since 1965.
From 1981 to 1990, juvenile arrests for murder  increased by 60 percent, while
adult arrests increased by just  5.2 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  percent. In 1990, juveniles
committed more than a third of all  murders in the country.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#16">16</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The sharp rise in juvenile crime presents a formidable  challenge for future
law enforcement. (see <a href="crime_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). There has been a  staggering increase in
juvenile arrest rates (see <a href="crime_t3.gif">Table 3</a>), as well as  in the number of arrests for
such heinous crimes as murder (see <a href="crime_t4.gif">Table 4</a>). From 1985 to 1993, the number of
juveniles aged 13 and  14 arrested for murder increased 162 percent. The murder
arrest  rate increased 207 percent for 15-year-olds, 197 percent for 
16-year-olds, 146 percent for 17-year-olds and 119 percent for  juveniles aged
18 to 20.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#17">17</A>  The numbers of
juveniles involved in  aggravated assaults, rapes, and robberies also are rising
dramatically. If  trends continue, according to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation,  arrest rates for violent juvenile crime will double by the year

<P><B>Relationship Between Crime and Family Breakdown</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The insufficiency or absence of government social programs  does not fuel
violent crime. The social science literature is  conclusive on one all-important
point: The real root cause of violent crime  is the breakdown of family and
community, especially in  America's inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The professional literature shows that the failure of fathers  and mothers
to care for the children they bring into the world is at  the heart of violent
crime. Absent fathers, absent mothers,  parental fighting and domestic violence,
lack of parental supervision  and discipline of children, patterns of parental
abuse, neglect or  rejection of the child, and criminality among the parents
themselves   all are conditions that contribute to the creation of a violent 
crimi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  nal, and all are most present in
the social atmosphere created  by broken families and illegitimacy.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#18">18</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Race and Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While serious crime is highest in socially disorganized,  largely urban
neighborhoods, however, its frequency is not a function  of race. The
determining factor is the absence of marriage.  Among broken families, with
their chaotic, &quot;dysfunctional&quot;  relationships, whether white or black,
the crime rate is very high; among  married, two-parent families, whether white
or black, the crime rate  is very low. The capacity and determination to
maintain stable  married relationships, not race, is the pivotal  factor.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#19">19</A>  The chaotic, broken community
stems from these chaotic, broken families.  The reason race appears to be an
important factor in crime is the  prevalence of wide differences in marriage
rates among ethnic  groups. A report from the state of Wisconsin further
illustrates this.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1980 and 1993, according to the latest available data,  the number
of black inmates rose from 46.5 percent to 50.8 percent  of the total prison
population, from 140,600 to 445,400. Justice  Department findings show that, at
the end of 1993, blacks were  seven times more likely than whites to have been
incarcerated in a  state or federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per
100,000  black residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were 
incarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31,  1993.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#20">20</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The fact that crime rates are much higher for blacks than  whites has
tempted some to cite race as a factor in overall crime. It  is therefore
important for candidates to explain that the  evidence does not support this
view. When social scientists control for  fam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ily structure, the rates for
blacks and whites are not  significantly different. Broken families are most
closely correlated with  violent crime, regardless of race. In other words,
family structure,  not race, is the leading indicator of criminal behavior.
There is  a higher rate of crime among blacks only because black  communities
have higher rates of illegitimacy and family breakup.

in 1988 was re-arrested on new felony charges while  out on bail pending trial.
Some 30 percent of felony defendants  with five or more prior convictions and

<P>During the 1960s, crime policies based on liberal theories of  social
injustice sent fewer criminals to prison for shorter terms. The  number of
offenders imprisoned for every 1,000 violent crime  arrests plummeted by almost
50 percent, from 299 in 1960 to 170  in 1970.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#31">31</A>  Tougher law-enforcement policies
began to return in  the 1970s, and the crime rate slowed as the rate of
incarceration  increased 38 percent. In the conservative 1980s, far tougher 
policies were adopted. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, on December  31, 1994, the
number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S.  residents was 387  up from 139
in 1980. The rate of  incarceration more than doubled from 1980 to 1990,
increasing by 219  percent. In 1980, there were 329,821 federal and state
prisoners; by  1990, there were 773,919. By 1994, the total number of people 
incarcerated in federal and state penitentiaries since 1980 had  increased 219
percent to 1,053,738 (see <a href="crime_6.gif">Chart 6</a>).<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#32">32</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should note the correlation: With  more violent

<P><B>The Failure and Abuse of Probation and Parole</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress and elsewhere often bemoan the fact  that there are
more than 5 million persons in the United States  under &quot;correctional
supervision.&quot;  While it is true that the U.S.  prison population is at an
all-time high, however, most of those  incarcerated are violent criminals or
repeat offenders. Moreover,  while approximately 1 million persons are
imprisoned, an  overwhelming majority of convicts  another 3.5 million, or 72
percent  are  not in prison, but on probation or parole,<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#33">33</A> and the disparity  between the
rate of imprisonment and the rate of release on probation  or parole has been
growing in recent years. Between 1980 and  1994, while the prison population
increased by 184 percent, the  parole and probation population increased by 204 
percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A large proportion of America's crime problem derives from  the fact that so
many criminals, including violent and repeat  offenders, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  are out on the streets. According
to Professor DiIulio, nearly  one-third of parolees imprisoned for violent
crimes, and nearly  one-fifth of those imprisoned for a crime against property,
are  re-arrested within three years of their release for committing a  violent
crime. Among convicted felons on probation alone, 54 percent  are arrested once,
24 percent are arrested twice, and 22 percent  are arrested three or more times.
<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#35">35</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data from the bipartisan Council on Crime in America show  that &quot;On any
given day, seven offenders are on the street for  every three who are behind
bars. During 1994 about 4.2 million  cases were handled on probation and 1.1
million were processed on  parole. On any given day, there are about 1.5 times
more  convicted violent offenders out on the streets on probation or parole 
than behind bars.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#36">36</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and federal and state policymakers  should encourage
innovative leaders at the state and local levels,  like Governor George Allen of
Virginia, who are stopping the abuse  of probation and parole and eliminating
these options for violent  offenders. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#37">37</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One major flaw in current criminal justice policies is the degree  to which
convicted criminals are sentenced to probation with  no prison time at all, or
to jail terms of one year or less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that, in 1990, state  courts (where
95 percent of crimes are prosecuted) sentenced 29  percent of all criminal
offenders to probation without incarceration.  Another 25 percent were sentenced
to jail terms of one year or  less. Thus, over half (54 percent) of criminals
convicted in state  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  received either no incarceration
or sentences of less than one  year in jail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For violent offenses, 20 percent of convicted criminals  received probation
with no incarceration, while 21 percent received  jail terms of less than one
year, leaving 41 percent of all  convicted violent offenders in these two
categories. Even for the crime  of murder, 5 percent of convicted criminals
somehow received  only probation, and 4 percent received one year or less in 
jail<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#38">.38</A> For the crime of rape, 14
percent received probation, and 19 percent  were imprisoned for one year or
less, leaving one-third of  convicted rapists with little or no serious
incarceration (see <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table 5</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While on probation, hard-core repeat offenders continue to  commit crimes.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 43  percent of those on
probation between 1986 and 1989 were arrested  at least once on felony charges
within three years of being placed  on probation. During that same period, 46
percent had been  committed to prison or jail or had disappeared, skipping out
on their  probation.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#39">39</A>  Of those
receiving probation for murder, 5 percent  were re-arrested for murder, and 16
percent were re-arrested for  some felony within three years.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#40">40</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to another Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, 35  percent of
state prison inmates in 1991 were convicted of a new  offense committed while
they were on probation or parole.  Probation and parole violators comprised 30
percent of all offenders in  state prisons for a violent crime, 56 percent of
inmates incarcerated  for property offenses, 41 percent of those convicted of
drug  offenses, and 85 percent of those in prison for public-order offenses. 
Collectively, probation and parole violators committed 90,639  violent 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  crimes while being supervised
within the community (based  on reported convictions).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More than 25 percent of probation and parole violators were  in prison for a
violent crime. Fifty-five percent of probationers  and parolees reported that,
in the month before their current  offense, they were using drugs. An estimated
41 percent were using  drugs daily. Of probation and parolee violators
imprisoned for a  new offense, 21 percent reported using a firearm while under 
supervision. Of those possessing a firearm in the month prior to  arrest, almost
75 percent were armed when they committed their  current offense. Between 1975
and 1991, the number of parolee and  release violators entering state prisons
increased from 18,000  to 142,000  twice the rate of growth among offenders
newly  committed from the courts.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#41">41</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Light Prison Sentences and Parole Lead to Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that criminals generally serve only a  fraction of their
sentences, even as sentences themselves are often  too short. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of parole and early release programs, sentences  handed down by
state courts do not indicate time actually served. <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table  5</a> shows the estimated
average time that will be served under  sentences imposed in state courts in
1990, given past trends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data collected from the states by the Bureau of Justice  Statistics indicate
that for violent crimes, the average time served is  three years and seven
months (43 months) or 48 percent of the  original sentence (89 months). For
murder, the average is only five  years 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  and 11 months (71 months) or 48
percent of the original  sentence (149 months); for robbery, three years and
eight months  (44 months) or 46 percent of the original sentence (95 months);
and  for rape, five years and five months (65 months) or 56 percent of  the
original sentence (117 months).<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#42">42</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These short prison terms for violent repeat offenders do more  than trigger
a sense of injustice among victims. They also mean  more crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1985, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that  approximately 28
percent of all male convicts, and 46 percent of recidivist  convicts, still
would have been in prison for their first crimes at  the time of their admission
to prison for a second crime if, instead  of being paroled, they had been given
sentences in the  maximum range for their original convictions. These
percentages would  be substantially higher for those who committed another crime
 within their original sentence than they would be for those  apprehended,
prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned during that  time.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In another study released in 1987, the BJS estimated that 69  percent of
parolees 17 to 22 years old were re-arrested within  six years of their release
and that about 29 percent of new  arrest charges occurred before these parolees'
original sentences  would have ended.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#44">44</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the bipartisan Council on Crime in America,  &quot;In 1991, 45
percent of state prisoners were persons, who, at the  very time they committed
their latest crimes, were on probabtion  or parole. While free in the community,
they committed at  least 218,000 violent crimes, including 13,200 murders
and11,600  rapes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  (over half of the rapes against
children).&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#45">45</A>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Federal Courts Still Gutting Truth in Sentencing Laws</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recognizing the tendency of early-release prisoners to  commit crimes, more
and more states are adopting &quot;truth in  sentencing&quot; laws to keep
criminals incarcerated for as much of the full  sentence as possible. Under the
most common formulation, a  criminal convicted of a violent crime is required to
serve at least 85  percent of the full sentence. This is perhaps the most
effective  judicial remedy for violent crime devised so far, because it
eliminates  probation and parole for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, liberal jurists, apparently more concerned with  protecting
the rights of prisoners than with protecting the rights  of law-abiding citizens
victimized by violent crime, are trying to  gut these laws. This is particularly
true of federal judges who, to  relieve prison overcrowding, often order that
even violent  criminals be released back to the streets. Few states and
localities can  avoid this federal intervention: Some 39 states and 300 of the 
nation's largest jails operate under some form of federal court  direction.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#46">46</A>  The 1994 crime bill inadequately
addressed the issue, and  the problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ostensibly to eliminate &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of 
prisoners have been released onto the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot;  has
never been defined, so each judge is free to determine it on a  subjective
basis. Far from the popular image of groups of  prisoners crammed into single
cells, it has come to mean, as arbitrarily  defined by several judges, simply
more than one prisoner to a  cell. Some federal judges even refuse to allow
convicted felons to  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  sent to prison, citing &quot;overcrowding,&quot;
and just release them   even violent criminals and repeat offenders. These
released felons  have been responsible for tens of thousands of additional
violent  crimes. For example:

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As Heritage Foundation Distinguished Fellow William Bennett  has argued, in
the field of public policy there is no more  important personnel decision than
the hiring of a police  officer.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#49">49</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The dramatic performance of the New York City Police  Department in
combating violent crime and the innovative  community policing methods employed
in Houston, Texas, provide  ample models for effective police management.
Unfortunately,  however, a few men and women who should represent the best in
their  communities sometimes turn out to be the worst, as revealed in  press
accounts from around the nation detailing alleged police  brutality, corruption,
and incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the recruiting and staffing of state and local police forces is  done to
select the best in terms of professional competence,  personal courage, and
moral character, the value to society is beyond  calculation. When Americans are
threatened by violent criminals,  they want the very bravest and the very best
to rescue them and  their loved ones. They want police officers capable of
excellent  judgment, as well as physical courage, who can make  split-second,
life-and-death decisions without violating the parameters set  forth by the U.S.
Constitution. Moreover, they want police officers  and detectives who are
shrewd, intellectually capable of cracking  the most difficult cases, and able
to work with the prosecution team  to advance the best case against criminal
defendants in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most egregious failures in police effectiveness invariably  have been
failures of personnel management: the deliberate  imposition of lower
intellectual and physical standards in recruitment  and hiring, reduced
background screening, the substitution of  &quot;politically correct&quot;
racial or ethnic or gender &quot;diversity&quot; for strict  standards of
competence or merit, poor supervision of officers in  the field, and a lack of
attention to moral character in the selection  of police. For example:

residents, generated a disproportionate amount of  police wrongdoing. A shocking
10 percent pleaded guilty to murder  and drug trafficking charges. Many of these
recruits were &quot;utterly  unsuited&quot; to police work, and poor training, &quot;inadequate
 supervision,&quot; and ineffective internal controls enabled them to  behave
with a &quot;contempt for the law.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#50">50</A>

<P><B>*     Washington, D.C.</B> Standards for recruiting and hiring police in
 the nation's capital have been notoriously lax. In 1982, 40 percent  of
applicants failed the admissions test. Then the tests were  &quot;dumbed down,&quot;
as were the intellectual and physical standards for  graduation from the police
academy. In 1987 and 1988, the  graduation rate was close to 100 percent. Facing
a horrendous wave of  violent crime, the city in 1989 and 1990 resorted to rapid
hiring,  with weak or even non-existent background checks. The results  should
not have been surprising: In the first ten months of 1992, 32  police officers
were indicted on criminal charges which included  murder, theft, assault with a
deadly weapon, sodomy, and kidnapping,  and another 20 were under investigation
by the U.S. Attorney's  Office for similar crimes.<A

<P>Americans need, want, and expect the best in their police  officers. While
no state or local jurisdiction should impose racial or  gender quotas on the

found in every sector of the  community, among every race and ethnic group.
There is nothing worse than  a bad cop and nothing better than a good one. Good
police  officers are those with outstanding character, firmly anchored in the

<P><B>The Huge Cost of Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Crime imposes high costs on individuals and families.  Victims suffer direct
economic damage in loss of funds and property.  They also experience pain,
suffering, cruelty, temporary or  permanent physical impairments and even loss
of life. Potential victims  suffer fear, inconvenience, and loss of freedom and
pay an economic  cost for extra locks, bars, guns, and other equipment in trying
to  avoid crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Crime also imposes huge costs on neighborhoods and  communities.
Neighborhood businesses lose sales when customers  fear crime while shopping.
Neighborhood workers lose jobs when  businesses and investors are scared away by
fear of crime.  Children lose the opportunity to learn when their schools are
dominated  by gangs and drug dealers who make it impossible to maintain  a
learning environment. Governments lose tax revenue when  sales, businesses,
jobs, and property values decline in crime-ridden areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Several studies have attempted to quantify these costs:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, crime victims  in 1992 lost
$17.6 billion in direct costs. These direct costs  include items such as losses
from cash, property theft or damage,  direct medical costs, or lost income from
loss of time at work. It does  not include indirect costs, including the costs
of long-term health  problems, higher insurance premiums resulting from changed 
health status, or the pain and suffering, the non-economic damage,  that
afflicts victims of violent crime, which would make the  economic costs of crime
signifcantly higher.

<P>One consequence of the disproportionate incidence of  crime against black
Americans is that black and other minority  neighborhoods face greater losses in
economic opportunity and growth  as small entrepreneurs are crippled and jobs
are destroyed. With  their schools so often undermined by crime, black and other
 minority children are often denied the basic educational opportunities  enjoyed
by white children in equivalent neighborhoods. Crime  and its associated costs
constitute a high extra tax on businesses  and households in low-income minority
communities. As discussed  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  Chapter 6, poverty is not the
root cause of crime in these  neighborhoods; crime is a root cause of poverty.
Until crime is  drastically reduced in America's inner cities and low-income and
 minority communities, social programs or other efforts to revive their 
economic fortunes cannot succeed.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While state and local officials have primary responsibility  for combatting
crime, there has been a noticeable weakening of  federal enforcement in areas
directly under federal jurisdiction.  Federal narcotics prosecutions dropped 25
percent from  1993-1994, for example, and prosecutions for firearms violations
dropped  20.5 percent. Since the enactment of President Clinton's Violent  Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the 1994 crime  bill), the Clinton
Administration has initiated no significant  legislative efforts on the problem
of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $30 billion omnibus crime bill is itself a huge expansion  of federal
authority into functions traditionally performed by  state and local officials.
Key provisions include $8.8 billion worth  of funding for the hiring of police;
$9.7 billion for prisons and  other correctional initiatives; $6.9 billion for
crime &quot;prevention&quot;  activities, largely social programs; and $4.8
billion for several  other measures, including a 10-year ban on the sale,
manufacture,  and importation of 19 types of assault weapons, the creation of 
state registries for violent sex offenders, and the expansion of the  death
penalty to dozens of new federal crimes. Of course, 98 percent  of violent
crimes fall under state and local, not federal,  jurisdiction 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  and are subject to state and
local, rather than federal, policy  initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Funding for Local Police. </B>The Clinton Administration is  promising
to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America's  cities. The reality
is that the 1994 crime bill funds only $8.8  billion for police over six years,
far less than the full amount required  to put such a number on the streets on a
permanent basis. But  more important than the number of police is their
function, their  specific tasks, and where, precisely, they are assigned. To
fund police  to fight crime would seem to be simple: Send the money directly  to
state or local government according to a straightforward  formula that reflects
population, crime rates, or a combination of both.  That has not happened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Based on the level of violent crime, it is clear from <a href="crime_7.gif">Chart  7</a> <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#66">66</A> that high-crime cities were
underfunded and low-crime cities  were overfunded. Worse, police funding has
become yet another  extension of the Clinton Administration's politically
correct  &quot;diversity&quot; agenda, a classic liberal program of social
engineering in  which local police departments are required to establish racial
or  gender-based quotas under the guise of crime-fighting in order to get 
federal funding. Under the Clinton Administration formula, local  police
departments must submit analyses of &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women and
minorities in accordance with &quot;community labor  statistics&quot; (broken
down by race, sex, gender, and job category);  outline &quot;affirmative action&quot;
plans that include &quot;goals&quot; and  specific steps to achieve &quot;goals&quot;
for correcting the &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women; and transmit
quarterly reports, plus a copy, to  official Washington on their progress in
implementing these federally  approved plans. So onerous is compliance (within
30 days) of  these

unrelated to reducing violent crime  that Oklahoma City Chief of Police Sam

turned down the program,  largely because they could not afford the 25 percent
financial match  requirement for participation in the program. Moreover,
according  to an analysis by the General Accounting Office, 7000 local 
jurisdictions did not even apply for the Clinton Administration's  grant money
overwhelmingly because of the cost of participation,  but cited other factors as

<P>In 1983, the Justice Department estimated that up to 55,000  serious

<P>Congressional action on habeas corpus is long overdue. Under  an 1867

the death penalty until every  conceivable legal loophole has been exhausted.
Petitions in many  state courts are similarly abused.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should:
</P>
<P><B>-     Restrict the ability of the federal judiciary to impose prison 
caps.</B> Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress  attempted
to bar federal judges from imposing prison caps   restrictions on the number of
prisoners that can be incarcerated at a  particular prison which result in many
violent criminals being  released long before their terms have been served. With
the  legal assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),  liberal
lawyers and federal judges quickly found ways to evade this  provision.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therefore, the first major initiative of the new Congress should  be to
define clearly the scope of federal judicial authority over  state and local
prisons and &quot;abide by federal laws governing the  limited role of the
federal courts in conditions of  confinement.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#71">71</A>  New Members of Congress should
reassert their clear and  indisputable constitutional authority under Article
III, Section 2, and define  for the federal courts the &quot;exceptions&quot;
and &quot;regulations&quot; that  should 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  apply to federal judicial action
over state prisons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reduce federal intrusion into state crime-fighting activities  and
help the states fight crime by letting them keep more of their  own money.</B>
Congress should affirm the division of authority  between the federal government
and the states in combating violent  crime. Federal officials have enough to do
in fighting the illegal  narcotics traffic and enforcing federal laws against
powerful  organized crime syndicates without trying to get involved in fighting 
street crime. Therefore, Congress should undertake a systematic  review of every
federal law dealing with violent crime, determine  which provisions interfere
with or undermine legitimate state and  local law enforcement authority, and
then repeal them. Congress  also should review Department of Justice advocacy
before the  Supreme Court to determine whether the department is adequately 
supporting state and local law enforcement officials in criminal cases,  and
should examine the impact of the Supreme Court's Miranda  rules governing
confessions to make sure that these restrictions do  not unreasonably limit the
ability of police officers to question  criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the meantime, if Congress wants to assist state and local  law
enforcement authorities, it should rebate up to two percent of  the federal
personal income tax taken from the residents of any  state on the condition that
the state raise an equivalent amount to  combat violent crime within its
territory. Representative  James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) in 1994 offered a similar
proposal  under which these rebates would have amounted to $55 billion in 
constant dollars over a five-year period, a reliable stream of  funding for
anti-crime initiatives.

<P><B>-     Hold hearings on the real root causes of crime.</B> Given the 
disconnect between official Washington's thinking, embodied in the  social
spending in the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1994, and reality,  Congress should
conduct a series of hearings on the real root causes   the long term causes  of
crime, particularly on the importance  of family structure, including marriage
and religious practice, in  preventing violent crime. The professional
literature, the most  recent scholarship, and particularly the experience of
private  organizations involved in crime prevention, all are wide and deep on 
this point.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Conduct a serious review of all national social programs.</B> 
Congress should review all national social programs, particularly  those which
are supposed to help prevent or reduce crime, with the  director of each program
required to present both the evaluation  data on the program's effectiveness and
national trend data on the  problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal federal restrictions on prison labor.</B> All federal
statutes  restricting prison work should be repealed. These include  the
Hawes-Cooper Act of 1929, which authorizes states to ban  commerce in
prison-made goods within their borders; the  Sumners-Ashurst Act of 1940, which
prohibits transportation of  prison-made goods within a state for private use;
and the  Walsh-Healey Act of 1936, which prohibits prison work on government 
contracts exceeding $10,000.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#72">72</A>

</P>
<P>In 1995, Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL) introduced a bill  (S. 930) to
accelerate the reform of prison operations. The bill  requires inmates in
federal prisons, and in the prisons of states  receiving federal money under the
1994 crime bill to help them  build 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  new facilities, to work 48 hours
and study 16 hours per week.  The legislation also repeals the social work
requirements of the  1994 bill; significantly reduces prisoners' &quot;free time&quot;
to enjoy a host  of amenities; and requires that the food prisoners receive is
not  superior in quality or quantity to the food made available to  enlisted
personnel in the United States Army.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Debate on the relative effectiveness of rehabilitation and  punishment has
swung back and forth in the penology literature for  over a century. The appeal
of the Shelby proposal is that it  combines rehabilitation, education, work, and
punishment in one  package. Nor is it really all that stringent; all it requires
is that a  prisoner's life be similar to that of a hardworking young taxpayer
who  holds a job and goes to college at night.

<P>Amid the social collapse of so many urban neighborhoods,  there are stunning
examples of successful efforts to turn around the  lives of young people
previously immersed in crime. These efforts  invariably possess two features: a
strong system of rules within  an organization that is characterized by the love
and firm  guidance most often seen in a supportive family and a strong spiritual
 dimension, most commonly a profound religious commitment  to living a good
life. Examples abound.

<P>One thing is common to all these efforts: giving people a place  to belong.

<P><B>-     Heed the recommendations of law enforcement organizations  on the
fitness of judicial nominees.</B> The American Bar  Association has become
highly politicized in recent years. Its leaders have  resorted to inflammatory
political rhetoric in attacking the  leadership of Congress, and its liberal
ideological bias has long since  compromised its integrity as an independent
reviewer of the  professional qualifications and fitness of candidates for
judicial office.  The President should dispense with the ABA's advice and seek
an  alternative source for measuring the professional fitness of  judicial
candidates. At the very least, he should give equal consideration  to the views
of constitutional experts selected by law  enforcement associations,
particularly with regard to the sensitivity of  judicial nominees to public
safety.

</P>
<P><B>-     Order the Justice Department to issue an annual  state-by-state
report card on key indices of crime prevention and reduction.</B>  The key to
reducing crime is for state and local officials to  identify repeat offenders
and keep them in prison for long terms so  they cannot continue to prey upon the
public. In 1992, former  Attorney General William Barr produced a thorough
report detailing  the changes that need to be made to accomplish this  goal.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#73">73</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most of these changes need to be made at the state level, where  98 percent
of all crimes are prosecuted. The Attorney General  could issue an annual report
card based on reductions in violent  crime and the adoption of specific
crime-fighting remedies. Rankings  on crime reduction could be based on current
FBI and Bureau of  Justice Statistics data. Rankings on crime-fighting could be
based  on a state's adoption of specific remedies. Therefore, the  states
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply restrict pre-trial release for dangerous defendants.</B> 
States should enact legislation and, if necessary, amend their  constitutions to
allow for detention without bail pending trial for  defendants who pose a proven
threat to victims, witnesses, or the  community at large. Legislation to grant
judges this power in  federal courts was adopted in 1984. Under this law, a
judge who finds  that release will endanger the safety of any other person or
the  community, and that no combination of conditions on a release can 
reasonably assure such safety, may deny bail and order the  defendant detained
until trial. Any defendant convicted within the past  five years of a violent
crime committed on pre-trial release is  automatically presumed to be a danger
to the community. An  additional sentence of two to 10 years also applies to any
felony  committed while on pre-trial release.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This law has worked well at the federal level and provides a  model that
should be adopted by every state to prevent repeat  offenders from committing
crimes pending trial, which remains a  significant problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply limit probation.</B> Probation should be prohibited for 
the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  following serious offenses:
murder, rape, armed robbery,  felonies involving the intentional or knowing
infliction of serious  physical injury, or a second conviction for any felony.
Probation  leaves these classes of criminals free to threaten law-abiding 
citizens. Limiting it is a commonsense way to keep serious repeat  offenders off
the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Adopt strict state sentencing guidelines.</B> A comprehensive  and
complex set of guidelines developed by the U.S. Sentencing  Commission has been
adopted to govern sentencing for federal  crimes. These guidelines specify a
narrow range of sentences for  each crime which vary according to the
seriousness of the crime,  the prior record of the defendant, whether a weapon
was used,  how much bodily injury or financial loss was caused, and other 
factors. Federal judges must impose sentences within this narrow  range, except
in cases where the judge believes special  circumstances warrant a departure.
The prosecution or defense may appeal a  sentence departing from the guidelines,
and such departure will not  be upheld without a strong and valid justification.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If states adopted such sentencing guidelines, liberal or  lenient judges
would be hard pressed to evade them. This is one of  the most important reforms
state officials could adopt to get  repeat offenders off the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abolish parole for violent offenders.</B> Under federal 
sentencing guidelines, parole has been all but abolished. Early release is 
allowed only for &quot;good time credits,&quot; which may reduce the  imposed
sentence by no more than 15 percent. If states adopted  this standard, it could
be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep  violent repeat offenders in prison.
Virginia Governor George Allen  made 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  this reform a central theme in
his criminal justice reform program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Acquire adequate prison space.</B> No reform aimed at 
incarcerating repeat and violent criminals can succeed without sufficient 
prison space. In most jurisdictions, including the federal system,  this means
constructing or otherwise acquiring additional capacity.  As former Attorney
General Barr has said, &quot;The choice is clear:  More prison space or more
crime.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#74">74</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lawmakers can justify this expenditure by noting that the cost  of acquiring
additional prison space is offset not only by the  far larger savings to society
from reducing crime, but also by the  incalculable benefits derived from
protecting the lives and  property of American citizens. Costs also can be
reduced significantly  by contracting out the construction and operation of
prisons to  private firms which have a proved they can build and operate 
additional prison space at substantially less cost than government 
bureaucracies. With private owners and operators, government also need  not
provide full financing of construction costs up front  a  severe constraint in
most states. Financing could be obtained by  the owner in private capital
markets and recouped over time  through fees paid by the government for use of a
facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Private firms have proved they can construct and bring into  operation new
facilities much more quickly than the  government, thereby reducing capital
costs. Competitive market incentives  produce more cost-effective construction,
management, and  operation design on the part of private firms. Private
construction of  prisons is much more common than private operation, but there
still  are dozens of successful prisons operated privately with higher  quality
and at much lower cost.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#75">75</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to work.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to require inmates to work full-time while in prison. Any net  earnings should
go first to the victim as restitution, after which at least  half should go to
the prison to finance incarceration costs. In  addition to generating funds for
these purposes, required work would  teach discipline, mold positive social
attitudes, and develop work  skills that enable the prisoner to obtain gainful
employment after  release. A 1991 federal study found that convicts who worked
in  prison were less likely to commit crimes after release and much  more likely
to be gainfully employed.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#76">76</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Requiring prisoners to work also can reduce operating costs  by using at
least part of the resulting products and services to  offset prison budgets (see
below). Texas A&amp;M economics  professor Morgan Reynolds points out that in
the past, many prisons  were self-financing thanks to required work by  inmates.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#77">77</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to study.</B> Training, education, and 
counseling sessions should be offered to prisoners in the evenings and  on
weekends  the same time non-criminal working adults  outside prison must attend
classes. Requiring such extra effort to  obtain the benefits of higher
achievement would teach better social  attitudes and build self-respect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     End furloughs and other temporary release programs.</B>Violent  or
repeat offenders should not be released from prison on  unsupervised furloughs,
work/education release, or other temporary  or conditional release programs.
Nearly 60 percent of prisoner  escapes in 1990 occurred during furlough or
work/education  releases,<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#78">78</A> and
many crimes are committed by prisoners during  such 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  furloughs or releases.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#79">79</A>  Violent or repeat offenders also
should  not be released pending appeal of a conviction, as this merely  allows
them the further opportunity to flee and commit additional crimes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Impose the death penalty for heinous crimes.</B> The death 
penalty should be imposed for several particularly serious offenses:  murder of
law enforcement officers, murder committed during  commission of a serious
felony, murder committed in prison, or  other murders in which the jury finds
aggravating factors that  outweigh any mitigating factors and result in a crime
sufficiently heinous  to justify death as the penalty. In fact, the death
penalty is used  sparingly in the United States. According to the Bureau of
Justice  Statistics, of the 4984 prisoners sentenced to death during the  period
1973 to 1993, 226, or 4.5 percent, were  executed.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#80">80</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The death penalty deters potential murderers, permanently  prevents repeat
offenders, and exacts appropriate justice for the  most heinous crimes.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#81">81</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Guarantee victims' rights.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to establish clearly the following rights of victims: the right to  be present
and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial  proceedings parallel to the
rights of defendants, including bail and other  hearings, plea negotiations,
sentencing, and any other public  proceedings; the right to present a &quot;victim's
impact statement&quot; at the  time of sentencing, with surviving family members
exercising the  deceased victim's rights; the right to full restitution out of
any  assets or earnings of the defendant, including the full rights of 
collection as enjoyed by any other creditor, with exemption from discharge  if
the criminal files for bankruptcy; the right to be fully informed  of all
proceedings against the defendant, as well as the  defendant's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  incarceration; and the right to
mandate HIV testing of  defendants in sexual offense cases before trial, and
periodic tests to catch  a latent HIV infection. In addition, every prosecutor's
office  should have a victim-witness coordinator to inform victims of their 
rights and help them exercise those rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each state also should establish in its criminal statutes a clear  right of
self-defense that allows the victim of a crime to use  deadly force to protect
himself from bodily harm and to protect his  home or business. The same right of
self-defense &quot;without  retreat&quot; should apply elsewhere when the victim
is not at fault in  causing an altercation. Innocent victims should not be
subject to legal  second-guessing of the snap  and usually frightened  
judgments they make under extreme distress in exercising their right to 
self-defense, though use of excessive force must remain illegal.  The law also
should exempt from civil liability any action  committed in self-defense that is
not a violation of criminal law, as well  as any other injury suffered by a
criminal while committing  a crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#82">82</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reform the juvenile justice system.</B> While overall crime rates 
have declined, the major criminal threat to civil society is the rapid  increase
in juvenile crime. Yet juvenile criminals generally are  exempt from the
criminal justice system until they reach age 18;  instead, they are often
covered by juvenile delinquency systems  that impose little if any real
punishment, typically granting  probation for crime after crime or holding
offenders for relatively short  periods in ineffective juvenile detention
centers. Gaining control of  the crime problem therefore requires thorough
reform of the  juvenile justice system.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> states should enact legislation that allows adult charges 
for juveniles 14 or older who commit murder, rape, kidnapping,  armed robbery,
or assault with a firearm, or who intentionally inflict  serious physical
injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> all offenders who remain in juvenile delinquency  systems
should be required to pay restitution to their victims. For  every serious
offense, the juvenile also should be sentenced to  extended, mandatory
participation in a highly structured community  service or public works program
after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> an extended sentence to an institutional boot camp  should be
required for repeat offenders, juvenile offenders who fail  to comply with
sentenced participation in community service or  public works programs, and
juveniles under the age of 14 who  commit violent crimes. Such boot camps should
be operated with  military-style regimentation and discipline, providing
education and  requiring work on a highly structured schedule. Young offenders 
generally come from single-parent families, with many of their  neighbors and
even parents involved in drugs, alcohol abuse,  prostitution, or other crimes.
Their moral development can be  achieved only by removing them from this
environment and keeping  them in one that requires moral responsibility for
several years.  Sentences to such boot camps until adulthood at 18 should be 
common for those whose crimes qualify them for such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> records of juvenile convictions for crimes of  violence
should be carefully maintained and made available at  sentencing for any future
crimes of violence committed in juvenile years  or adulthood. Studies show that
juvenile crime records are one of  the strongest predictors of repeat adult
crime. Considering these  ear
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  lier convictions will lead to
stronger sentences for repeat  offenders at an earlier age, thereby further
reducing  crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#83">83</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Clean up the police departments and make greater use of  community
policing.</B> Most police officers are solid members of their  communities, but
the failure of the criminal justice system to  incarcerate repeat and violent
offenders demoralizes even the best of  them. Beyond this political failure, too
many cities have made  matters worse by deliberately lowering service standards
and  imposing racial and gender quotas on a job that should be filled only on 
the basis of individual merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The absence of effective screening for criminal misconduct,  poor starting
salaries, poor supervision by commanders in the  field, atrocious personnel
management, failure to recruit personnel  of outstanding character as well as
ability  all these factors  have combined to encourage patterns of brutality,
corruption, and  demoralization in too many police departments in American 
cities. Charges and revelations of corruption, brutality, and  tampering with
evidence in Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Los  Angeles have undermined public
confidence in the police. There is no  substitute for character and moral
integrity in a police officer: A  bad person cannot be a good cop. From the
standpoint of  personnel management, recruiting, and hiring, the acquisition of
good  police officers should be the first order of business. And while  officers
should be recruited from every sector of the community, only  the best should be
hired  and only on merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>State and local officials also should return to an older tradition  of
policing. The police in most communities operate by patrolling  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  police cars, waiting for calls
for help and then responding  as quickly as possible. An alternative strategy
now developing  is known as community policing. Under this approach, officers 
are assigned to small neighborhoods and are responsible for  getting out of
their cars and spending most of their time walking the  beat. By visiting local
businesses, talking to residents, attending  community meetings, and learning
first-hand what is going on  and what the citizens are concerned about, they
gain a far more  detailed understanding of the people and their neighborhoods. 
Police-citizen community activities include organizing citizen  crime-watch
patrols, canvassing local businesses and private  security guards to glean
information, and instructing all citizens on  what they must look for to assist
the police and avoid becoming  victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The community policing strategy has proven quite successful  in deterring
crime, apprehending criminals, and removing fear  from communities.84  State and
local governments should use this  approach more widely, substantially
increasing police personnel  and assigning them to high-crime areas where they
can provide  a strong police presence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are conservatives more interested in sending more  young men to
prison than in keeping them out?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The first task of government is to protect its citizens.  That
means putting more violent criminals in prison and keeping  them there.
Rehabilitation programs have not delivered on their  promise to reduce violent
crime, and citizens should not be asked to  put 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  their hopes in rehabilitation for
these kinds of criminals.  Innocent citizens are not protected by such hopes.
This is not to say  that long-term prevention strategies should be abandoned. To
the  contrary, conservatives affirm prevention strategies, including  many now
operating in the private sector, that work and are  solidly grounded in the
institutions that can best prevent crime: the  family, the church, and the
school. In the meantime, a sound  conservative social policy would aim to
strengthen these institutions. This is  the best way to keep young men out of
prison. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#85">85</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't crime going down?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes; overall, violent crime is going down slightly. That is  the
good news. Nevertheless, it is still 350 percent higher than just  30 years ago.
Further bad news is that teenage violent crime is  going up and shows every sign
of continuing to rise for the next 16  years at least unless there is a major
cultural change in the United  States. This is so because the rise in violent
crime is directly related to  the breakdown in family and community, and
Americans have yet  to see an increasing number of out-of-wedlock children grow 
up without parental supervision, love, or discipline. If  Americans somehow
could turn the deteriorating family structure  around, strengthening the
nation's families and recording no more  out-of-wedlock births from today
onwards, we still would have to  wait for this psychologically damaged and
potentially violent group  of young offenders to work their way through the
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is wrong with imposing uniform federal sentences?   Shouldn't a
crime receive the same penalty in any part of the US.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We have state and local judges and juries to evaluate the  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  cumstances and the level of guilt
in each case. Judges ought  to have descretion to impose different sentences;
but, at the  same time, criminals should be required to serve at least 85
percent  of these sentences. Truth in sentencing is just that: If you do  the
crime, you do the time. Everybody is clear: the judge, the  jailer, the
criminal, and  last but not least  the citizen. But that is  a policy decision
best left to the states. Local communities can  best assess the effectiveness of
their local judges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress oppose federal assistance  to police
in the President's crime bill?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress don't oppose federal assistance  to
local law enforcement. Under the proposal enacted by the  House of
Representatives, Congress can continue to do the very best  that the Clinton
Administration program can do, but can do it  even better. With the
congressional block grant approach, passed by  the House of Representatives and
threatened with a veto by  President Clinton, local police can get even more
money, may be able to  hire even more personnel, and they will have even more
flexibility  to use these funds in a fashion that best suits local needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the Clinton Administration funding for police is at  the
discretion of the President. There is solid evidence that  Administration
funding does not go to localities hit hardest by  violent crime. For example,
Portland, Oregon, which accounts for 56  percent of all violent crime committed
in the state of Oregon, got  less than one percent of the funding awarded to 
Oregon.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#86">86</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't America's prison population exploding because law  enforcement
is cracking down on minor drug offenses?  
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. As the bipartisan Council on Crime in America  reports, since
1974, over 90 percent of all inmates in state prisons  have been either violent
offenders or repeat felons. Between 1980  and 1993, the number of persons
imprisoned for violent crimes  grew by 221,000, or 1.3 times the growth of those
imprisoned as  &quot;drug offenders.&quot;  Furthermore, 80 percent of federal
and state drug  offenders are drug traffickers with a history of repeat
offenses.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>American education continues to be in crisis. Government  spending on
education has skyrocketed even as school performance  and student achievement
have remained static, leaving young  Americans ill-equipped to function in
today's increasingly  competitive world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The liberal solution, as always, is more money, more  bureaucracy, more
regulation, more federal intrusion. Candidates need to  emphasize that America's
education crisis cannot be solved by  central government decree. Schools will
not be improved by letting  Washington run them. The crisis can be solved only
by taking  power away from centralized bureaucracies and empowering  parents,
teachers, principals, and local school boards to take charge  and make things
better for their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most important education goal of the 1990s is to put  parents and
teachers in charge of education  at the local level. In  the nation's large
cities in particular, public schools have  become faceless monopolies,
insensitive or indifferent to parental  and teacher concerns about quality,
standards, and discipline.  Public schools must be made fully accountable to the
parents and  children they are meant to serve. That means parents  especially 
low-in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  come parents  must be given the
power to transfer their  children to, and the public funds to educate their
children, in other public  or private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High academic standards lie at the heart of effective  education. But
standards must reflect America's tradition of local  control: They should be
locally adopted and adapted to local needs  and capacities. While education is a
national issue, it is a local  responsibility. Federal &quot;remedies&quot; are
barriers to needed innovation  and reform, not the solution. Indeed, the
original genius of the  federal system was that the states were &quot;laboratories
of democracy.&quot;   Each state, and each local school district, can learn from
the others.  The federal push to establish fashionable outcomes-based 
education, and the reaction it has precipitated, should remind us that the 
federal role should be minimal and non-interventionist.  Decisions need to be
made in local schools and the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, since the time of the ancient Greeks, schools have had  a central
mission which embodies but goes beyond academics:  character formation. Students
should become better people by virtue  of attending school; habits of hard work,
honesty, self-respect,  and respect for others are essential to democratic
capitalism,  and schools should support their development as ardently as they 
support mastery of mathematics and English. The public school  in America once
proudly carried out that function  now  many schools undermine it. There is, as
well, a pressing practical  issue: Schools must be safe and secure learning
environments for  students, teachers, and other members of the education 
community. The lesson should be clear: Learning is important, self-discipline 
is important, and standards of behavior will be enforced, just as  academic
standards will.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Adopting institutional reforms centered around school choice  for parents,
autonomy for teachers and principals, and genuine  teacher professionalism can
change the system's fundamental  incentives. Today's government- and
union-controlled monopoly can be  replaced with a diverse and flexible system
controlled by  parents. The result will be freedom of choice for parents,
teachers, and  students, greatly improved school performance and student 
achievement, and a vastly improved working environment for teachers  and
principals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's public schools once provided citizens with a  common culture and a
sound basic education. In recent decades,  however, the public school system has
failed utterly to provide  Americans with these essentials.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>SAT scores have dropped nearly 60 points in the past three  decades  even
though the test has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  The  same answers in 1992 as
in 1960 score between 18 and 30 points  higher than three decades ago. Thus, the
real loss is somewhere  between 98 and 110 points.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a classic example of denial, the Educational Testing Service  has
responded to this crisis by &quot;re-centering&quot; SAT scoring for  1995 and
beyond. To disguise the poor performances of American  students, all SAT scores
are now reported on a higher scale. The  test also has been renamed. No longer
the Scholastic Aptitude Test,  it is now the Scholastic Assessment Test: same
acronym, less utility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But trying to make the picture look better by altering SAT  scores fools
nobody. The school system is failing. In 1969, Congress  created the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)  to survey student achievement
nationwide on a regular basis.  Over the years, these assessments have found
that:

<P>
</P>
<P>The latest results show that there has been little if any  improvement. The
1994 NAEP history assessment showed that more  than half of American high school
seniors lack a basic knowledge  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. history. The test, composed
of multiple choice and  essay questions, was given in early 1994 to a national
sample of  22,500 fourth, eighth, and 12th graders in both public and private 
schools. The results:

<P>

<P>The information gets worse. A 1995 NAEP study revealed that  the best
writing students produce as part of their classroom work is  not very good.
Writing samples collected from a nationally  representative sample of more than
3,000 4th and 8th graders showed that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Only 1 percent of 4th graders and 12 percent of 8th

<P><B>States vary widely.</B> In its <I>Report Card on American  Education

50 states and the District of Columbia, the  American Legislative Exchange
Council (ALEC) found that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Nationwide, student performance did not improve 
significantly from 1992-1993 to 1993-1994. SAT scores remained  unchanged, 35

1.3 percent from 1980.  ACT<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#8">8</A> and

Utah, Wisconsin, and  Wyoming (see Table 5).

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending at Record Levels</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While education performance has been mediocre at best,  education spending
is now at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the 1994-1995 school year, total education spending in  the United
States was estimated to be $508.3 billion, up 178  percent from the 1980-1981
school year (see <a href="educ_t1.gif">Table 1</a>).This amounted  to about 7.5 percent of GDP for
1994-1995, almost double the  spending on national defense.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Total spending on public elementary and secondary schools for  the 1994-1995
school year was $283.9 billion, an increase of 173  percent from 1980-1981 in
nominal terms. From 1972 to 1992,  public school spending rose 490 percent in
nominal terms (see <a href="educ_t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Overall, the federal government spent $35.2 billion in  constant 1994
dollars on education in 1994-1995, up from $29.7 billion  in 1980 (see <a href="educ_t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending per pupil in the public schools has soared: $6,857  in 1994-1995,
up 150 percent from 1980-1981 in nominal terms  and 44 percent in 1994 dollars.
Since 1970, per-pupil spending  has risen 554 percent in nominal terms and 73
percent in  constant 1994 dollars (see Table TK).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>ALEC's report card clearly supports conservative arguments  that student
performance measures, compared with per-pupil  expenditures, average teacher
salaries, and other education spending  variables, indicate no direct or
systematic relationship between  spending and student performance. 
</P>
<P>None of the ten top-performing states in terms of student  achievement
ranked among the top ten in per-pupil education spending  in 1993-1994; most
spent less than the national average per pupil.  In addition, none of these
states ranked among the top ten in  average teacher salaries last year (eight
actually paid less than the  national average); nine held per-pupil spending
increases below the  national average during the last 11 years; and seven did so
during  the preceding 21 years as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="educ_t5.gif">Table 5</a> shows, Iowa scored first in SAT scores and tied  for 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  first on the NAEP test, yet its
spending per pupil was below  the national average; Utah spent the least per
pupil, yet scored  second on the SAT and eighth on the NAEP test; and North 
Dakota ranked 36th in spending but tied for first on the NAEP test  and scored
fourth on the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, New Jersey spent the highest amount per pupil  and scored 37th
on the SAT and 14th on the 1992 NAEP test; the  District of Columbia ranked
second in spending per pupil and  scored 49th on the SAT and 42nd out of 42
states on the NAEP test;  and ninth-ranked Rhode Island scored 43rd on the SAT
and 23rd  on the NAEP test.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     According to ALEC, report card, New Jersey spent
more per  student ($9,429) than any other state in the nation during the 
1993-1994 school year. New Jersey also held the same per-pupil  spending rank in
1992-1993 and still increased per-pupil spending  significantly more than the
national average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Teacher salaries also increased nationwide last year, rising a
 modest 0.1 percent after inflation. Connecticut paid the highest  average
teacher salaries last year ($49,500); South Dakota, the  lowest ($25,199).
</P>
<P>

 increased substantially. Using Census Bureau population  projections, and

<P><B>*</B>     Total education spending will rise more than 47 percent 
(almost $125 billion in constant 1994 dollars), and per-pupil spending  will
increase almost 32 percent to $7,942. As a result, the  per-capita 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  education tax burden will rise by
one-third, and the typical  family of four will face an average annual education
tax increase  of $1,340.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>That there is no correlation between spending and performance  has been
demonstrated by a wide variety of studies, perhaps most  notably in the
exhaustive study of the performance of  America's schools for their landmark
1990 book, 
<I>Politics, Markets and America's Schools,</I> conducted by Brookings
Institution  Senior Fellows John Chubb and Terry Moe. The evidence showed 
clearly that increased spending and resources do not translate into  better
school or student performance. The relationship between  resources and
performance has been studied extensively by social  scientists, who agree that
financial resources are of less consequence  that other variables. Most
important is &quot;school climate,&quot; the extent  to which a school offers a
safe and disciplined learning  environment with staff and students motivated by
a shared commitment to  academic excellence. The performance problems of the
public  schools cannot be corrected solely by digging deeper into the  public
purse.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#9">9</A>  Many studies make this
point.

statistically significant relationship between student  achievement and any of
the school characteristics that are often  thought important: teacher-pupil
ratios, teacher education,  teacher salaries, and per pupil expenditures. This
should come as  no great surprise. Over the last two decades, as school 
performance has deteriorated and stagnated, per-pupil spending  in schools has
increased nearly 100 percent after inflation,  class sizes have shrunk more than
20 percent, and most  teachers have acquired master's degrees.<A

<P>International Comparisons
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the home front, there is some modest good news. Black  test scores have
made small gains, and women's have as well.  More students are taking more
demanding courses. The number of  them taking advanced placement courses and
tests continues to rise,  as does the number of higher scores. But these are
just a few  bright spots in a gloomy picture. The bottom line for conservative 
candidates is that all American children could be doing  significantly better,
as indeed all must if we are to have confidence in the  future. Academic
performance in America is not world-class,  and offers no promise of becoming
world-class by the year 2000  except in a few isolated schools and districts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reasons for this huge discrepancy between America's  schools and our
international competitors are not hard to fathom.  American public schools are
not designed to succeed. Pony Express  institu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  tions in the electronic age, they
are hopelessly out of date.  The issue is not money (see <a href="educ_2.gif"
>chart</a>), but standards,
organization,  and accountability. Too little is expected of American students;
as  a consequence, they give too little. There are few rewards for  success and
fewer penalties for failure. A system designed and  run without incentives and
rewards ineluctably panders to the  lowest common denominator, as American
education has done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Where Teachers Send Their Children to School</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Public school teachers are sending their own children to  private schools
rather than allow them to become lost in a public  school system in disarray.
This was reported in a May 1995 study by  The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis Doyle</a>,
prepared under the  auspices of the Indiana-based Hudson Institute and published
and  distributed by the Washington-based Center for Education  Reform.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#13">13</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This study, drawn from the 5 percent household sample of  the 1990 Census,
shows that, taken together, public and private  school teachers nationwide are
only slightly more likely than the  general public to choose private schools
(17.1 percent to 13.1 percent).  In America's most troubled cities, however, the
results are quite  different:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In troubled cities, public school teachers are two to three  times more
likely than the general public to use private schools. For  example, in
Washington, D.C., 25.7 percent of public school  teachers who make less than
$35,000 send their children to private  school. This is more than double the
national average; among  public school teachers nationwide, 11.9 percent enroll
some or all of  their children in private school. The trend continues in cities
like  Boston 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  (24.4 percent), New York (21.4
percent), Miami (35.4  percent), and Los Angeles (18.9 percent). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, &quot;in our nation's cities, where the schools are 
arguably the worst, a large number of teachers abandon the  institutions in
which they work and enroll their offspring in private schools.&quot;   This
includes teachers of all races.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Black public school teachers use private schools more than  white public
school teachers (12.9 percent to 11.9 percent), and  Hispanic public school
teachers use private schools more than  non-Hispanic public school teachers
(16.5 percent to 11.9 percent).  Meanwhile, white parents are somewhat more
likely than nonwhite parents  to send their children to a private school. In the
United States as  a whole, 13.1 percent of all parents, 14.2 percent of white 
parents, 8.1 percent of black parents, and 10.8 percent of parents of  other
races send their children to private schools. Some 13.4 percent  of Hispanic
parents send their children to private school, compared  to 10.1 percent of all
non-Hispanic parents.

<P>Overall, then, black public school teachers are almost as likely  as the
public at large to use private schools (12.9 percent to 13.1  percent). This
means that &quot;black teachers who can afford a  choice exercise it: they are
50 percent more likely than black parents  in general to enroll their children
in private school. This might  explain the high support for publicly funded
school choice  programs among minorities  they are often in the worst school
districts  and are more inclined to put their children in private schools when 
they can afford it.&quot;  Across the United States, &quot;teachers  public  and
private, white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, low  income, middle income,
and high income  know how to address  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  nation's education crisis: they
vote with their feet and their  pocket books. They choose private schools for
their children when  they think it serves their interests best.&quot;

<P><B>How Teacher Unions Obstruct Reform </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the larger  National Education
Association (NEA) have become the  bane<U> </U>of school reformers. They are
big and well funded, and they have  a major presence in Washington and most
state capitals.  Teachers are, in fact, the most heavily unionized segment of
the  American work force, and the NEA is particularly opposed to serious 
education reform. But teachers are not necessarily synonymous  with their
unions. They vote for Republicans as well as Democrats  and are concerned with
many of the same issues that concern  reformers. The tide could begin to turn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One sign that teachers recognize the need for reform, as  noted above and in
the following table, is the extent to which they  enroll their own children in
private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another encouraging sign is the willingness of AFT  President Albert Shanker
to champion high academic standards and  school discipline.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#14">14</A>  At the same time, however,
Shanker's opposition  to innovations such as school choice remains implacable.
The  education establishment fears that public schools as we know them  will
disappear, but this is all the more reason to adopt a more  innovative approach
to public education. This fear of change is  narrow and self-serving. Preferring
the known to the unknown, the  education establishment reveals its limited
vision and how little it  actually cares about the welfare of children.

<P><B>The Federal Takeover</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The attempted federal takeover of American education,  launched with fanfare
and good will during the Great Society 30 years  ago, has been revealed for what
it is: a prolonged and serious  mistake. It is now abundantly clear that
Washington both  over-promised and overreached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Programs intended to improve the education of the poor and  dispossessed
have borne bitter fruit, emerging by and large as  self-serving employment
programs for educators. Student test  scores have remained largely static, and
the promise of public  education as a way out of the mire of social pathology
has not  materialized. Instead, inner-city public schools themselves have become
 trapped in the pathology of the inner city. Almost without exception,  the only
schools which have escaped, and whose students have  done well, are private
denominational schools.
</P>

languages  so  crucial to a future of sophisticated technology and international
 competition. America's children are not learning enough, they  are not learning

<P>If local and state officials really wish to improve the education  of our

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Vouchers Are Needed</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The main difficulty in addressing the sorry state of  America's schools lies
in the fact that those in charge have a vested interest  in resisting change.
The efforts of those most concerned about  falling test scores  usually parents,
but many teachers as well   usually meet with a discouraging combination of
bureaucratic lethargy  and outright resistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the first order of business for reformers must be  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  wrest enough control from the
bureaucracy to effect  serious change. Several promising policy solutions have
been put  forward to accomplish this. One of the best is the concept of school 
choice, which would end the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to the public
 education system by opening up options for students to attend  higher-quality
private schools. The best way to make private  schools more accessible to the
parents of children currently enrolled  in public schools is also the simplest:
through government vouchers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice vouchers are transfer payments from the  government to
families of school-age children which permit these  children to attend the
school of their choice, whether public or  private, secular or religious. The
practice is widely followed in the  developed democracies and is spreading
rapidly in the former Iron  Curtain countries. America is, in fact, the only
developed nation  that denies its children this form of assistance to help them
attend  non-public and denominational schools. It may well be that the  last
truly deprived minority in the United States is made up of  poor children whose
families prefer a religious education but  cannot afford to pay for it out of
pocket.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#28">28</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous opinion polls show broad public support for  school choice,
especially among inner-city minorities and the poor,  who suffer the worst
schools under the current system with no  feasible alternatives. School choice
offers conservative candidates a  powerful opportunity to attract strong support
from this traditionally  liberal constituency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The opposition, by contrast, comes from the education and  union
bureaucracies  the only people who gain from the current  monopoly. School
choice is a threat to them because it would  give 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  parents and teachers the power
and control enjoyed for decades  by a professional managerial elite increasingly
out of touch with  the communities they are supposed to be serving.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Role of Charter Schools</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Two other promising innovations are the charter school and a  related idea,
private contracting for school services. Charter  schools are public
institutions in terms of mission and funding, but are  run autonomously by the
signatories of a charter. They can be run  by an association of parents,
teachers, business leaders, or any  combination of these. While the charter
school movement is both  new and small, varying significantly from state to
state, the idea  is promising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The basic concept of charter schools is simple: &quot;Allow a group  of
teachers or other would be educators to apply for permission  to open a school.
Give them dollar for dollar what a public  school gets for each student but
without any strings attached. Free  them from the regulations that cripple
learning and stifle innovation  at so many public schools.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#29">29</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the four years since the first charter schools opened their  doors in
Minnesota, 18 other states have passed charter laws in  various forms, and 234
of these schools are up and running around  the country.<A

<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> Yes, if  the school is nonsectarian, but

<P><B>Hiring:</B> Schools are not required to hire  certified teachers.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>MINNESOTA:</B> The state that pioneered the charter concept  revised its
law to strengthen it in 1993 and 1995. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cap:</B> Increased  to 40 schools in 1995 after being set
originally at eight and later at  12 schools. </P>
<P><B>Schools open:</B> 17. </P>
<P><B>Approval:</B> Only licensed teachers  can operate a school. Charters
must first be approved by a local  school board, community college, state
university, or technical  college, with the state board of education granting
final approval. Such  an approval process is more limiting than Arizona's, but
in 1993,  lawmakers amended the original law so that charter applicants 
rejected by the local school board can appeal to the state board  if two members
of the local board voted to approve the  charter.</P>
<P><B>State/local control:</B> Schools are exempt from state laws and local 
district policies except those regarding health, safety, civil rights, and 
children with disabilities or special needs. They also have  complete control of
the money they receive from the state.</P>

<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> No.</P>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most thoroughly developed example is Yvonne Chan's  Next Century
Learning Center in Los Angeles, and the most  promising state legislation for
Charter Schools is Arizona's which is  wide-ranging and flexible. In most
jurisdictions, however,  charter schools are poorly developed and kept on a
short leash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The education establishment  notably the National  Education Association and
various school board associations at the state  and national levels  give lip
service to charter schools but offer  no real support. The reason: Charter
schools are a very real threat  to the status quo. Once in place, they could
revolutionize  American education. They combine the best aspects of a
functioning  public school system  public support, public access and
accountability   with much of the flexibility of private schools. They are an 
important and useful first step to freeing teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Contract Management.</B> Still in its infancy as a way of  operating
schools or school districts, contract management of various  aspects 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  of education is a
long-established practice. School cafeterias,  busing, business services,
textbook acquisition, purchase of  supplies and materials, janitorial services,
and the like have been  turned over to private contractors and run efficiently
in many districts  for many years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What remains is to begin trying the concept in curriculum  areas such as
reading, math, and foreign languages, as well as in  running whole schools or
school districts. There is no conceptual barrier  to contract management; it is
used in almost all other areas of  government services, from national park
concessions to military  training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The idea behind contract management is simple: Pay an  independent
contractor to perform an assigned task and devise  measures that will determine
whether that task has been performed  successfully. Interestingly, one of the
most difficult tasks school  districts face in contract management is &quot;specifying&quot;
the terms of the  contract; since many schools do not have a clear sense of 
mission, they find it very difficult to specify what they want to  accomplish in
the language of a contract. The exercise, however, is useful,  and education
establishment opposition to such a straightforward  idea is both
anti-intellectual and inflammatory. The issue is subject  to analysis and
validation, and should be welcomed as another way  to improve education
performance.

also can play a critical role in  helping schools set priorities, identify
measurement tools,  improve communication with and between schools and the
larger  community, and help develop performance measures that will  rationalize
pay for teachers and administrators. Perhaps most important of  all, business
leaders can help school boards behave in a more  businesslike fashion. In
particular, business can help school boards  end &quot;micro-management&quot;
and support candidates for school  boards who are both responsible and
effective.

<P>The 1995 legislative session once again brought school choice  to the
forefront of the education debate at the state level. State  legislatures
debated numerous voucher and charter school bills over  the 1995 session, and
several states have passed or improved  their charter school laws. In two
states, Ohio and Wisconsin,  first-in-the-nation school choice programs were put
into  place.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#33">33</A>  Several other
states debated the issues and some proposals cleared the  relevant committees.

<P><B>Charter Schools.</B> Both chambers of the Florida legislature  passed

Connecticut  is considering many education reforms, including both a  voucher
proposal and charter schools.

<P><B>Voucher Update.</B> According to Marquette University's Blum  Center for
Parental Freedom in Education, choice and voucher  initiatives were pursued in
the following states during 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*    Ohio.</B> Governor George Voinovich in June signed
into law a  two-year budget package creating a $5.25 million pilot voucher 
program in Cleveland, to become effective in September 1996.  With his
signature, Governor Voinovich enabled Ohio to become  the first state in the
nation to complete the enactment of school  choice that includes religious
schools. The proposal included in the  budget package was approved by the
House-Senate Conference  Committee on June 23, 1995, and will allow parents of
2,000  Cleveland students to redeem vouchers at private or religious schools. 
With this new legislation, Cleveland becomes only the second city in  the
country (the first being Milwaukee) to allow private school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Wisconsin.</B> In June, Wisconsin's legislature passed genuine 
school choice legislation, which, along with the rest of Governor  Tommy
Thompson's budget proposal, was signed into law on July  25, 1995. The
legislation called for the expansion of the  Milwaukee Parental Choice Program
to include religiously based  schools (MPCP currently allows students to attend
non-sectarian  private schools in Milwaukee).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Governor Thompson's earliest version of the choice proposal  had set the

to 3,500 in the fall of 1996 and 5,500 in  the next year, after which the
enrollment limitation would have  been eliminated. Before the package was
approved by the Joint  Finance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  Committee, Representative Annette
&quot;Polly&quot; Williams, the  original sponsor of MPCP, called for a larger
expansion proposal  which increased enrollment to 7,000 in the fall of 1996,
after which  it would be limited to 15,000. This expanded proposal was  approved
by the Senate on June 29 after having been approved by the  State Assembly on
June 21.

include religious schools. This action  left more than 2,300 children stranded
after having already signed  up for classes in the religious schools of their
parents'choice. In  an astonishing display of community support, private funds
have  been raised to offset the loss of public funding. Oral arguments  have
been set for February 27, 1996, and a final decision is not  expected from the
Wisconsin Supreme Court until spring. According to  the Landmark Legal
Foundation of Kansas City, Missouri, &quot;the  Milwaukee school-choice
litigation will ultimately result in a  major U.S. Supreme Court decision
allowing school-choice  programs that include religious programs.&quot;

the proposal would likely  offer vouchers worth approximately $500 to $3,000, to
be given on  a sliding scale according to income. A family of four  earning

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton promised to do something to help improve  the education of
America's children. While his rhetoric has been  appealing, however, he has
failed to keep his promise. Instead  of &quot;revolutionizing, revitalizing and
reforming&quot; America's  schools, he actually has slowed the process of
change. While creating  new government bureaucracies, increasing federal
regulations,  and boosting the rate of spending at the federal level, the 
Administration also has resisted real efforts to reform America's  education
system. The President has chosen to ignore academic &quot;outputs&quot;   real
results  and has focused instead on spending more  taxpayer dollars on &quot;inputs.&quot;
 The Administration also has seriously  undermined the relationship of students
and their families to the  education process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Federal Takeover of School Districts (Goals 2000).</B> The  Goals
2000 legislation, enacted in 1994 as President Clinton's most  important
education program, has been a failure. Instead of  &quot;revolutionizing,
revitalizing and reforming&quot; America's schools as  President Clinton
promised, Goals 2000 has proved a barrier  to change.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#34">34</A>  It has created new government
bureaucracy and  boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to
undermine progress  to improve American education performance by encouraging 
schools to ignore real results and focus instead on obtaining federal  dollars
by showing Washington that more money is being spent on  &quot;inputs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000 will only  strengthen the federal
government's power to control local reform efforts  and hamper grassroots
reform. It is time for Congress to terminate  the program and divert the money
to real reform.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two important ways:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Building Bureaucracies.</B> Under Goals 2000, three new  government
bureaucracies would have been created: the National  Education Goals Panel, the
National Education Standards and  Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National
Skills Board. While  NESIC will not be empaneled, the philosophy behind these 
bureaucracies continues the command-and-control approach that keeps control  of
schools in the hands of education bureaucrats rather than  parents, teachers,
and students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Federalizing Education.</B> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to  local
control, it came dangerously close to mandating a  watered-down national
curriculum designed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying  national
history standards  a well-meaning attempt by  then-National Endowment for the
Humanities Chairman Lynne Cheney  to make educators teach real history again 
backfired last year  when the committee assigned to formulate them unveiled
standards  that were rife with political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The incident reveals one of the inherent dangers in the Goals  2000
approach. Had its members been appointed, NESIC would  have become a de facto
national school board whose 19 members  could have imposed a standard curriculum
of politically correct  revisionism on the entire nation. This central authority
would have  approved or disapproved all state-developed plans to meet goals  set
by the Education Goals Panel, another bureaucracy created  under Goals 2000.
Such attempts to federalize state and local  education discourage real
innovation and inhibit the most important  school 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  reform initiative of the decade,
the movement toward  privatization and school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The states, meanwhile, on their own initiative already have  begun to reject
federal interference in schooling. In particular,  outcomes based education, a
favorite idea of the education  establishment, has offended and alienated
thoughtful teachers and parents  across the country and has mobilized opposition
to the federal role.  Four states  Montana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Alabama
  have turned down or returned Goals 2000 funding, refusing to  permit more
federal intrusion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Another Middle-Class Subsidy:</B> AmeriCorps. Hailed by the 
Administration as an innovative effort to expand education  opportunity through
volunteerism, AmeriCorps, President Clinton's  national service program, has
evolved into a big-government  pork barrel. Although supporters maintain
AmeriCorps  &quot;encourages Americans to do volunteer work, helps people go to
college  and disperses decision-making power from Washington to  the states,&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#35">35</A> the rhetoric contrasts sharply
with reality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The AmeriCorps program does little to help American  families pay for
college, destroys the spirit of volunteerism, removes  participants from local
communities where they are needed most  and uses them to enlarge the federal
bureaucracy, and  improperly funds partisan political activities. Most
important,  AmeriCorps costs the taxpayers too much.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An August 1995 General Accounting Office report found  that AmeriCorps costs
$26,654 per participant to run, or more than  40 percent more than the
Administration's most recent  estimates. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Some 93 percent of the funding
for the program comes out of  taxpayers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993-1994, AmeriCorps employed about 20,000  &quot;volunteers&quot;
described as &quot;working all over America, helping people   person to person.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#36">36</A>  In reality, a significant number
of these highly  paid &quot;volunteers&quot; are working in federal or state
bureaucracies,  government-funded programs, or political action organizations.
Of  the 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot; currently participating in the program, 
2,053 are working in federal bureaucracies on programs funded by  the federal
government. <a href="educ_t8.gif">Table 8</a> presents a breakdown of  AmeriCorps participation within the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Student Loans.</B> While the Clinton Administration has portrayed  its
direct lending program for college students as essential to the  education
future of young Americans, the evidence suggests  otherwise. The program appears
to be bad for taxpayers, bad for  students, and bad for schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided  through
private institutions. But under the direct lending plan, the  federal government
borrows the money needed to provide capital for  the loans. This would require
the federal government to borrow  an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each
year. According to  Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK), a complete shift to
direct  loans could add as much as $348 billion to the national debt by the 
year 2014. The U.S. Department of Education is expanding to  handle the new
program, hiring 600 new employees to administer it  and anticipating need for
another 20,000 contract employees by  the time the program is fully operational.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are other worries about the direct lending program.  Currently, some
75 percent of all available college financial aid  comes from the federal
government. If the government takes  complete control of the loan program,
colleges and universities in effect  will become dependent on a single lender to
support their students.  The Education Department's power to control loan
revenue, along  with its expanded regulatory authority and enforcement power, 
will give the government vast influence over post-secondary  education. Such
financial power could enable the federal government to  influence or force
curriculum changes, or to mandate such things  as politically correct &quot;diversity
standards.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is little support for a government takeover of the  guaranteed lending
program. The solution is not to nationalize  the multibillion-dollar student
loan program. That would mean  new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans
believe strongly  that student loans should continue to be provided through
private  financial institutions, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The actions taken so far by the 104th Congress have  produced mixed results.
For the first time in 40 years, there was hope  for serious change in America's
education system. The Contract  With America, however, included little
discussion of education  reform or of countering President Clinton's hindering
of legislative  actions. After the first legislative year of the Republican 
majority, despite attempts to introduce far reaching reforms, liberal 
strangleholds and repeated filibusters have caused the 104th Congress  to fall
far short of implementing any serious reform. At the  same 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  time, however, conservative
actions within Congress have  helped make education one of the key issues in
1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming schools in the Nation's  Capital.</B> At the request of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), the Task Force on  D.C. Schools and Representative
Steve Gunderson (R-WI) developed  a plan that would have laid the foundation for
serious reform in  the District of Columbia public school system. Fundamental to
 these reforms was a scholarship proposal that would have put the  federal
government on record as supporting the concept of choice.  The proposal was
added as an amendment to the D.C. FY 1996  appropriations bill in the House.
Unfortunately, due to intense  objections by Democrats and liberal Republicans
in the  House-Senate Conference Committee, the entire set of education reforms 
remains in limbo as both sides refuse to budge.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson amendment authorized the establishment of  independent public
charter schools which would have used  existing D.C. public and private schools
as well as new schools  created with the help of the universities within the
District. It also  would have authorized many federal institutions within D.C., 
including the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Library of  Congress, and
the Smithsonian Institution, to help establish public  charter schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson legislation would have given scholarships of up  to $3,000 for
students whose family incomes were at or below  the poverty level and up to
$1,500 for students whose family  incomes were not more than 185 percent above
the poverty level.  These scholarships would have allowed low-income D.C.
families to  escape the failing D.C. public schools by giving them the 
resources 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  needed to send their children to
any private, independent,  religious or non-religious school located in the
District of Columbia or  the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and
Maryland.  They would have covered the cost of fees and other expenses for 
tutoring and instructional services after school hours and the costs  of
transportation for a student enrolled in a District of Columbia  public school,
public charter school, or private school participating  in the tuition
scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also included in the legislation was language to expand local  literacy
programs for the District from two programs to 20 in  the third year of the
initiative. These programs are instrumental  in helping to build reading skills
for children and their parents.  The legislation also would have helped
establish a panel to develop  a high expectations, academically challenging
curriculum and  assessment system for the D.C. school system.
</P>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Title I.</B> For more than 30 years, since 1965, Washington
has  spent over $90.5 billion on the Title I program, which still cannot  show
any long-term academic gains for children, even after being  &quot;reformed&quot;
five times. The House offered to cut funding for this  remedial education
program by $1.1 billion, from its current level  of $6.6 billion to $5.554
billion. The President is seeking $7  billion. Funding for the program is tied
to the Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education
appropriations  bill, which passed the House but had not been brought to the
floor  of the Senate for a vote by the end of the 1995 session because  of
opposition by Senate Democrats.

</P>
<P><B>Head Start.</B> While it is clear from several studies that any  success
for disadvantaged preschoolers gained through the early stages  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  Head Start is eroded by the time
the children reach the  primary grades, over the past 30 years Washington has
spent over  $31.2 billion on the program. Unfortunately, Congress has decided 
to continue its funding. The House passed a $3.39 billion grant  for preschool
health and education for FY 1996, which returns  Head Start funding to slightly
more than was allocated in 1994.  Again, the Senate has yet to take up the
appropriations for the  program. President Clinton is seeking an increase in
program funding  in order to extend services to 50,000 or more children by the 
year 2002.

program's funds are spread too thin, with some districts  getting only a few
hundred dollars. This program has shown no  effectiveness in reducing drug usage
in high schools, and there have  been no specific performance-based evaluations
of it since its  inception. Furthermore, a program evaluation report has shown
that  training sessions are &quot;more likely to focus on providing information 
about the use of various drugs than teaching resistance and  decision-making
skills.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#37">37</A>  The President has

school autonomy must go hand in hand with parental choice.  This will give
schools the ability to change. School autonomy  means that the principal,

parents as representatives, would  be free to run their school as they choose:
to select their own  curriculum, textbooks, staff, and teachers (which means
that teacher  certification requirements must be relaxed or abolished 
outright). Regulation of private schools also must be relaxed to the  absolute
minimum. In this way, parental choice can create an effective  market that
controls and regulates schools in accordance with the  preferences of parents
rather than according to the whims of a  bureaucratic elite.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Congress at the request of President Jimmy Carter  in 1979, not
yet two decades old, the U.S. Department of  Education is doing precisely what
its severest critics envisioned:  usurping local and state control by slowly and
steadily introducing  federal controls. Although it accounts for about six
percent of total  public funding of education, its influence is out of all
proportion to  its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education inserts 
itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the  nation's
15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and  intrusive, it is a
metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful  and meddlesome domestic
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet the most alarming aspect of the growing federal control  of education is
not administrative interference, but its adverse  impact on academic
performance, equally the product of sins of  omission and commission. The
increasing power of special interests,  the burgeoning size of school districts,
the refusal of the  public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening
 community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of  education,
general permissiveness, family dissolution  all have played  a role. At no time
in American history has academic  performance been more important. Yet as the
federal role increases,  education performance declines. The new federal role in
education  obviously was not intended to impair academic performance, but, 
steadily and almost without interruption, student academic  performance
nevertheless has fallen, and the Department of Education has  done nothing to
stop the downward spiral. While cause and effect  may be elusive, and the
department's supporters assert a variety  of causes to explain the decline in
student performance,  these changes occurred during, and as a part of, the
federal  ascendancy in American education.

<U>in lieu </U>state legislature for the District of Columbia. Congress  should
implement a comprehensive set of reforms for the D.C.  public schools, in effect
resurrecting the amendment offered by  Representative Gunderson during the 1995
session. The reform act should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Authorize the establishment of independent public charter 
schools,</B> using existing D.C. public and private schools as well as  new
schools created with the help of universities in the District. It  also should
authorize many federal institutions within D.C.,  including the National Science
Foundation and Smithsonian Institution,  to help establish public charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish charter schools which would help restructure the  existing
public school system,</B> allowing innovative school principals  and teachers to
work with parents and academic institutions to  overhaul the system.
Lower-income parents would have the right  to choose an effective private school
if they are not satisfied  with their child's public school. This would hold the
public schools  to account.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Provide scholarships of up to $3,000 for students</B> whose  family
income is at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for  students whose
family income is not more than 185 percent above  the poverty level. These
scholarships would allow low-income  D.C. families to send their children to any
private, independent,  religious or non-religious school located in the District
of  Columbia and the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and  Maryland.
They would cover the cost of fees and other expenses for  tutoring and
instructional services after school hours and the costs of  trans
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  portation for a student enrolled
in a District of Columbia  public school, public charter school, or private
school participating in  the tuition scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish a special panel to develop tests to monitor the  progress</B>
of the District's schools so that parents have real information  with which to
evaluate D.C.'s schools. This &quot;World Class  Schools Panel&quot; would be
responsible for developing a core curriculum  for kindergarten through 12th
grade. In addition, it would  encourage more private-sector involvement in the
District's schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is essential that this education proposal not tell D.C.  residents what
schools they must have. Rather, it must create the  conditions and incentives
for change. It would still be up to parents,  teachers, principals, and District
institutions to take advantage of this  opportunity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For Congress to bring about real reform for America's schools,  it must
first set a precedent by reforming the schools in its  backyard. Congress could
achieve this by attaching these reforms as  an amendment to the District's 1997
appropriations bill. This  would force the President and liberal Democrats in
Congress to hold  up the District's funding as the price for continuing to
oppose  real reform for the children who most need it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enact a Low-Income School Choice Demonstration.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representatives Frank Riggs (R-CA) and Dave Weldon (R-FL)  co-sponsored
voucher legislation in 1995 (H.R. 1640) similar to  a bipartisan bill (S. 618)
introduced by Senators Dan Coates  (R-IN) and Joseph Lieberman (R-CT). This
legislation, not yet  enacted, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  would allow any K-12 child
eligible to participate in the free  or reduced-price National School Lunch
Program to receive  vouchers to attend the public or private school of the
family's choice.  The bill would authorize grants for 10 to 20 low-income 
communities to establish voucher-based school choice programs at a cost of  $30
million over three years.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't education choice mean the brightest and most  affluent
students will escape, leaving the poorest and most difficult to  educate trapped
in bad public schools?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The exodus of the brightest and richest students happens  under
the current system because only they have the ability to  choose. Comprehensive
school choice gives poor inner-city children  the same freedom to choose their
schools that wealthier children  already enjoy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice improves all schools and benefits all children,  not just
those who change schools. The reason?  Competition forces  all schools to strive
to perform better in order to survive. This  has been the experience in East
Harlem, for instance, where  school choice proved especially beneficial to poor
minority  inner-city students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we need the public schools to teach all students a  common set
of basic values, beliefs, and democratic principles?   Doesn't choice leads to
diverse, fragmented philosophies  and views?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The public schools are not teaching a common set of  values,
beliefs, and principles. Many are teaching moral relativism  and
multiculturalism. Under comprehensive school choice,  schools must reflect the
values, beliefs, and principles common to  parents in order to attract students
and funds. The parents of each  child, not government bureaucrats and
politicians, should have the  final say over what that child is taught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't school choice encourage extremists or fanatics to set  up
bizarre &quot;cult&quot; schools and possibly even lead to such abuses as  the
indoctrination of students in Satan worship or racial supremacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Under a program of school choice, schools would have to  meet
minimum certification requirements, just as private schools  do today. Such
requirements effectively preclude extremist or  cult schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. With vouchers, wouldn't private schools receive  government money,
and so private schools would face heavy regulatory  control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No private school is required to participate in any school 
choice program. Private schools which receive no state funds today  would be
free to forego state funds under choice programs, leaving  them no worse off
than they are now. One of the fundamental  principles of comprehensive school
choice is autonomy, with each  school free to operate as it chooses. Choice
means reducing the  regulation of public schools to the minimum level now
applied to  private schools, not increasing regulation of private schools.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are keenly aware of what is right with America's  health care
system. They are overwhelmingly impressed with the  quality of medical services
they get from doctors and hospitals and  other health care providers; they
appreciate the fruits of modern  medical science and technology that are
available to them; they are  often satisfied with their own insurance plans, and
with the level of  benefits and services available to them through these plans.
At  the same time, however, Americans are concerned about the  current and
future costs of health care, the gaps in insurance coverage  that still
characterize the system, and the fact that too many  Americans are uninsured.
Moreover, they want the frustrating paperwork  and administrative costs of the
system reduced, both in the public  and private sectors, and the laws governing
medical malpractice  improved. And while they want to see certain aspects of the
 health care system reformed, Americans want reform that preserves  personal
choice and the quality of medical services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the past year, Congress has made the country aware of  the growing
financial pressures and instability of the  government's two huge health care
programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Failure  to modernize these programs means
having to drain an ever  larger portion of funds from existing government
programs,  contributing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  to higher deficits and taxes, and
compromising the level and  quality of care available for the next generation of
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Given the magnitude of these issues and concerns, the health  care debate
during the next election should revolve around three  central goals:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  The crises in Medicare and Medicaid must be resolved.</B>  Medicare
is facing bankruptcy. Absent structural reform, the program  is projected to be
insolvent by 2002. This financial crisis is  hitting Medicare just before the 77
million baby boomers, the  largest bulge in America's population pipeline, begin
to retire in  2010. The program needs to be reformed so that it can pay benefits
to  the next generation of retirees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress enacted sweeping Medicare reform in 1995 as part of  its Balanced
Budget Act. But President Clinton blocked this  reform by vetoing the
legislation and argues  wrongly  that no  tough decisions are needed to preserve
the program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Likewise, Medicaid, which serves the poor and the indigent and  is financed
jointly by the federal and state governments, is  experiencing explosive rates
of growth. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing segment of the
federal budget, with costs  increasing at annual rates as high as 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Medicaid is out of control because the federal government  curbs state
initiative through expensive mandates, preventing the  states from integrating
health care into other services. Medicaid must  be moved to the states.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Americans must be freed from the fear that they will  become
uninsured.</B> The main political pressure for changing the health  care system
comes not from those who are uninsured, but from  those who fear they will lose
their health benefits in the future.  Candidates need to recognize that most
insured working  Americans know someone who has lost his or her insurance and
has  faced financial hardship or disaster as a result. They do not want to  join
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain that this anxiety flows directly  from today's
employer-based health system. Americans can get tax  relief for health insurance
only on one condition: that they get  it through their employer. It is not
surprising, then, that this tax  bias in favor of health insurance through the
place of work has  created an employer-based health insurance market to the
practical  exclusion of often better alternatives. The employer-only system 
means that if workers lose or change their jobs, they also lose their  health
insurance. This anxiety about losing health benefits gives rise  to the twin
problems of a lack of &quot;portability&quot; and &quot;job lock.&quot;   The
portability problem is caused by the inability of Americans  to transfer their
health insurance from job to job. The related  phenomenon of job lock occurs
when an employee or family  member does not move to a more attractive job for
fear of losing  health benefits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This tax penalty against paying for health care directly or  obtaining
insurance from any source other than an employer must  be ended. Americans
should no longer be penalized for wanting  the security of owning and
controlling their own health care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Health care costs for working people must be brought  down 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  without sacrificing choice.</B>
While corporate premiums have  dipped during the past two years, health care
costs are still too high.  As employers try to control costs, they often simply
make  workers and their families pay a progressively larger share of the  health
insurance premiums, or else enroll them in managed care  plans which are far
more restrictive than traditional indemnity plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain to the public that the way to  bring down health
costs is not to provide less, but to improve the  efficiency of the health care
system by stimulating much greater  consumer choice and competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The movement to reform the health care system gains much of  its momentum
from the spiraling cost of medical care in America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>National health expenditures reached 13.9 percent of gross  domestic product
($884.2 billion) in 1993 and reached  approximately 15.6 percent ($1.1 trillion)
in  1995.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#1">1</A>  This compares with
$251.1 billion in 1980, when national health expenditures were just  under 10
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While few Americans even know how much the country as  a whole spends on
health care, they do worry about the rising cost  to them personally, as
individuals or as business owners.  Typically, people mistakenly blame rising
costs on drug manufacturers,  insurance companies, physicians, and hospitals.
But the rapid growth  in medical expenditures actually is attributable to the
rising  demand for medical services and new technologies and, more 
significantly, to the peculiar way in which the tax system treats health 
insurance, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  which leads to an artificial
employer-based system for most  working Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major factor in determining access to health insurance  coverage is
employment. 
</P>
<P>Overwhelmingly, working Americans receive their health  benefits through
their employer. The reason: For most working  Americans to obtain any tax relief
for health care costs, they must ask  their employer to earmark part of their
worker's compensation to  pay for a health insurance policy that the employer 
not the worker   then owns. This tax break ties health insurance to the place of
 employment. As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) explains:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     Tying health insurance to employment causes further 
inefficiencies. Workers who are sick or who have a sick  family member can get
trapped in their jobs because most new  insurance policies will not cover the &quot;preexisting
condition.&quot;   Finally, because insurance is tied to one's job, it is 
inherently insecure. Employees can lose their insurance if they lose  their jobs
or if their employer stops carrying  insurance.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#2">2</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax benefit for having employment-based coverage (and  thus the penalty
for not obtaining a plan in this way) is huge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     In 1996, the federal treasury will lose
approximately $93 billion  in foregone revenues, given the tax-exempt status of
employer  contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care. 
Households with income of $50,000 or more will share  approximately $53 billion
in tax relief on health care, compared to  households earning $20,000 or less,
which will receive only $5.4 billion in  tax relief.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#3">3</A> 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Lower-income employees normally receive no tax relief for  any
out-of-pocket expenses (such as deductibles and copayments);  nor, except in
very unusual circumstances, would they receive tax  relief or subsidy for a
health insurance policy obtained from any  other source.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Only health insurance is tied to the place of employment in  this way. Other
major forms of insurance, such as  automobile, homeowner's, mortgage, and life,
are not normally tied to  an individual's place of employment. This constricts
the market  and eliminates a worker's personal ownership of an insurance plan. 
It also has other serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     The current tax treatment of employment-based health  insurance
fuels higher health care costs.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the CBO:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Employment based health insurance is valued by  businesses
through tax subsidies. Yet those subsidies exacerbate the  high cost of health
care as well as some of the problems of the  uninsured people. Because the
amount of the subsidy  increases with the size of the health insurance premium,
the subsidy  not only encourages employers to provide insurance but also 
encourages them to provide the most expensive health  insurance policies.
Employees who have a choice among health  insurance options are more likely to
choose more expensive  plans because they have to pay only part of the
additional  costs.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#4">4</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Lower-income individuals and families are helped least by  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  current system of tax relief for
employment-based health  insurance.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The CBO points out that individuals and families at the upper  end of the
income scale receive far greater tax relief under the  current tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance. Those  who need the most assistance 
middle-income and lower-income  earners  benefit the least. In some cases,
lower-income wage  earners realize no benefit at all. The CBO states that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>[F]amilies with higher incomes receive larger tax  subsidies
because they are in higher income tax brackets. Thus,  the reduction in taxable
income that the exclusion produces  is worth more to them on average than it is
to families in  lower tax brackets. Because the income tax is progressive, 
people with relatively high incomes (and higher tax rates), who  may need the
least assistance in getting health insurance,  benefit the most from the tax
exclusion.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#5">5</A>
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1996, households with incomes of $50,000 or over will  receive
approximately $53 billion in tax relief on health care, while  households
earning $20,000 or less will receive only $5.4  billion.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#6">6</A>  In short, this means that the
value of the tax exclusion is  heavily skewed towards upper-income groups at the
expense of  middle-income and lower-income groups. Lawmakers must explain to 
the American people why they favor perpetuating a government  policy which gives

<P>A major misperception that conservative candidates must  explain to the
American public is that employment-based health  insurance is not a &quot;free
benefit.&quot;  Employers give employees nothing;  health benefits, like wages,
are part of an employee's total  compensation. Under normal market conditions,
there is invariably a  trade-off between wages and benefits; for every increase
in  employer-based health benefits, there is a corresponding decrease in wages 
and other compensation. As the CBO explains:

receive at  work &quot;employment based&quot; rather than &quot;employer

<P>Lewin-VHI, one of the nation's most respected health care  econometric

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal tax treatment of health insurance is exclusive.  Americans can
get tax relief for health insurance on only one  condition: that they get it
through their employer. If they have a large  benefits program, the tax breaks
are generous, and they get a large  amount of tax-free income; if the employer
offers a less generous  benefits package, they get a less generous tax break.
Employees who  purchase health insurance on their own receive negligible tax
relief  in comparison to employment-based packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only other significant health tax break for employees  under current law
is that individuals who itemize deductions may  deduct what they have paid
during the taxable year (if not reimbursed  by insurance) for medical care
(including medical insurance) to  the extent that the total of such expenses
exceeds 7.5 percent of  their adjusted gross income (AGI). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Employees and their families without adequate  employer-provided insurance
must go without insurance altogether or purchase  individual policies outside of
employer-based insurance. But  these individual policies are marketed on an
individual basis and  thus are considerably more expensive. Worse, a worker and
his  family will have to pay for these policies with after-tax dollars,  making
their purchase substantially more expensive than a similar  package of benefits
offered through an employer tax-free. For most  middle-class Americans, health
insurance outside of the  employer-based system is not a financially realistic
option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the federally created constraints on the health  insurance market,
which basically limit Americans to one type of  insurance option (employer-based
insurance), it is not hard to see why  employees often are unable or unwilling
to move or change jobs,  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  when career opportunities promise
better lives for them and  their families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It also is not surprising that uninsurance in the United States  is largely
a function of employment status. According to the  Employee Benefit Research
Institute (EBRI), a prominent  Washington think tank specializing in job-based
benefits, some 55.5 percent  of uninsured Americans are uninsured because of
loss of jobs  or change of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Uninsurance also is highly correlated with employment in  small businesses,
or businesses with smaller profit margins. Under  the federal tax code, workers
in small business are not on a level  playing field with workers in large
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Employment-based coverage, like public programs, has  fostered the
rise in third-party payments.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1970 and 1980, the amount of insurance premiums  paid by American
employers for their employee group insurance  policies increased by more than
352 percent. During the  mid-1980s, premium increases were between 6 and 8
percent annually;  by 1990, they once again were in double digits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1992, group health insurance plans amounted to  approximately 81 percent
of all insurance costs paid by employers in private  industry; group life
accounted for 2.5 percent; and worker's  compensation insurance accounted for
almost 16  percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#9">9</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of Medicare and Medicaid has contributed to the  trend toward
third-party payments. By 1992, private insurance and  gov

accounted for coverage provided  to 217 million Americans.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike automobile insurance, which provides for accidents  and other
unexpected events, medical insurance typically pays for  routine medical
services such as dental examinations. To  understand why third-party medical
insurance for routine services helps  drive up costs, consider what would happen
if automobile  insurance worked this way: It would cover not only damages due to
 accident or theft, but also all regular repairs, regular oil changes, and 
other routine expenses  perhaps even a weekly fuel fill-up. Now  suppose that
the insurance policy was paid for by the driver's  employer. The driver would
have little incentive either to question  a mechanic who said a certain repair
was needed or to quibble  about the price. The result would be predictable: a
rapid rise in  automobile repair and servicing costs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>HOW EMPLOYERS HAVE RESPONDED TO COST INCREASES WITH MANAGED CARE</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite the increased utilization of third-party payments, the  rate of
increase in health care costs has slowed in recent years.  Between 1992 and
1993, medical care prices, as measured by  the Consumer Price Index for Medical
Care (CPI-MC), rose by  just 5.9 percent.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#12">12</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One factor contributing to the recent reduction in growth has  been the
increased enrollment of workers by their employers in  man
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  aged care organizations. In the
private sector, at least, these  arrangements are less expensive than
fee-for-service or  traditional indemnity insurance plans. Managed care
organizations are  networks of doctors and hospitals in which the patient faces 
varying levels of limitation in the choice and availability of services.  They
include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).</B> HMOs generally  provide a
defined set of health services to an enrolled  population within a specified
geographic location. Providers usually are  reimbursed on a capitated basis,
which is pre-determined by the  HMO. By December 1994, there were 574 HMOs with
a total  enrollment of 51.1 million persons, or about 19.5 percent of the U.S. 
population.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs).</B> Developed in the  1980s,
the PPO tries to achieve the same type of cost savings as HMOs  by directing
patients to certain providers that have agreed to  cost-effective methods of
care delivery as prescribed by the PPO.  However, the PPO also gives patients
some degree of flexibility  and freedom by allowing them to select providers of
their choice at  a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Point-of-Service (POS) Plans.</B> POS plans combine the features  of
HMOs and PPOs. They utilize a network of selected,  contracted participating
providers, and if an employee goes to a plan  provider, there are minimal or no
out-of-pocket expenses. Enrollees also  can go to a provider not in the plan,
but will be charged  significantly higher copayments or deductibles.

<P><B>Who Are the Uninsured?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is routine to read that as many as 41 million people, or about  18
percent of the population, are uninsured. This estimate is  correct, but it also
hides more than it reveals. Americans need to be  reminded that 82 percent of
the nonelderly and 99 percent of  the elderly (aged 65 and over), or 215.7
million individuals, were  covered by private or public health insurance in 
1993.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#13">13</A>  Why the seeming
contradiction?  Because millions of the uninsured  lack coverage for only a
short time, typically between jobs (a  problem that nevertheless must be
addressed). Furthermore, most have  access to health services if they choose to
use them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most commentators tend to view the uninsured as a large,  undifferentiated
mass. A closer look, however, reveals that they fall  into three broad
categories: the &quot;temporarily&quot; uninsured, who are  without insurance
only briefly or intermittently; the &quot;voluntarily&quot;  uninsured, who
choose not to pay for medical coverage, although it  is accessible to them and
affordable; and the &quot;chronically&quot;  uninsured, who want to be covered
but cannot obtain affordable  coverage. The last category is the most troubling,
since 50.7 percent  of the uninsured in 1993 were in families with income under 
$20,000 annually.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#14">14</A>  It is this
relatively small segment of the  population that liberals often talk about but
have failed to help for the past  40 years. They represent a serious problem
that conservatives  must address.

<P><B>WHY THE CANADIAN SYSTEM IS NO ANSWER</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of those seeking to address the weakness of the U.S.  health care
system look to Canada's single-payer,  government-controlled system. Although
Canada spends less on health care as a  percentage of gross national product (10
percent in 1995) than does  the United States (15.6 percent in 1995), its
per-capita health care  expenses are still the second-highest in the world,
outranked only  by those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, it is important to understand how Canada's  lower spending affects
care.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Canada spends much less of its GDP on medical
research and  development, generally importing new technologies from the  United
States. The elderly, who tend to use health care services at a  higher rate, are
a bigger percentage of the population in the United  States than in Canada (12.2
percent vs. 11 percent).

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The cost of malpractice litigation and defensive

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Reduced availability of new technology and long
waiting lists  for many surgical procedures are perennial features of the 
Canadian system. Citizens of the U.S. have far greater access to  modern medical
technology and specialized medical services than do  Canadians. Indeed, the U.S.
ranks first among the world's nations  on most measures of technological quality
in health care.

<P>In addition to having to wait long periods for health care  services,
Canadians have been forced to reckon with the inevitable  consequences of a

the steepest rise in taxes of any  industrial country and a long stagnation in
middle-class incomes,  the central and provincial governments are racing to

<P><B>WHAT IS WRONG WITH MEDICAID AND MEDICARE</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Established as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great  Society program in
1965, Medicaid and Medicare were created as  open-ended entitlements.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicaid</B> was established as a joint federal-state matching  program.
It is an open-ended entitlement that pays for medically  necessary health care
services provided to specific groups of  low-income individuals. Individuals
eligible for Medicaid now  include the aged, disabled, pregnant women with
children, and the blind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending on Medicaid is out of control:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>*</CITE></B>     In FY 1995, Medicaid cost taxpayers $156.5
billion. Of  this amount, the federal government was responsible for 
approximately $89.2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#21">21</A> 
This represents an 11,050 percent increase  over the program's initial cost to
the federal government of $800  million in FY 1966. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Remarkably, Medicaid was not intended to provide health  insurance to all
poor Americans. Originally, individuals became  eligible because of their &quot;categorical&quot;
relationship to two federal cash  assistance programs: Aid to Families with
Dependent  Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). However, 
congressional mandates since the late 1980s have resulted in  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  expansions in Medicaid
eligibility provisions. Now the  eligibility of individuals in additional
selected low-income groups is  based solely on the relationship of their incomes
to the federal  poverty level. In recent years, a progressively higher
proportion of  Medicaid spending is for nursing homes of formerly middle-class 
aged who have spent their resources and have become eligible for  Medicaid
custodial care. Each state is responsible for defining its  own package of
covered medical services, but some benefits are  mandated by Congress. These

different restrictions on doctors alone. In 1983 and 1989, respectively,  it
introduced the Prospective Payment System (PPS) of fixed  payments for
procedures in hospitals and the Resource-Based  Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), an
enormously complex  reimbursement schedule, in addition to balanced billing
limitations, to fix  prices

patients.

<P>Such cumbersome controls have proved to be just as ineffective  in health

<P><B>A Model for Health Care Reform: The Consumer Choice  That Members of
Congress Already Have
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and 9 million other federal workers and  retirees, as
well as their dependents, enjoy a very different system  of health care.
Candidates might want to suggest that  Congress should let Americans in on the
same kind of system it now  enjoys: a system based explicitly on the free-market
principles of  consumer choice and competition. This system, known as the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), enables almost  400 private
insurance carriers nationwide to compete for the  personal business of Members
of Congress and their staffs along with  almost 9 million federal employees,
retirees, and dependents. Once  a year, these special consumers can make their
personal choices. It  is virtually the only system in the country where
individuals  and families can pick and choose the kinds of benefits and 
insurance plans they want at prices they wish to pay. In any area of the 
country, federal workers and retirees can choose from among a  dozen to two
dozen plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each year, the government contributes a set dollar amount to  each
individual or family for the purchase of a private insurance plan  of their
choice. If they choose a more expensive plan, with a  richer set of benefits,
they pay more directly for those benefits. If  they pick a less expensive plan,
with a less generous set of  benefits, they are able to pocket the savings from
making such a choice.  All of the plans have catastrophic coverage and, health
insurance  experts with the National Association of Retired Federal  Employees
(NARFE) rate all of the plans offered as &quot;good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, the federal government's managerial role in  the FEHBP has
been passive. The Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), the federal agency
which administers the FEHBP, has  focused on negotiating with private insurance
carriers, setting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  basic ground rules for
competition among private insurers,  and making sure that private insurance
companies meet fiscal  solvency, consumer protection, and basic benefit
requirements  outlined in statute. While the FEHBP is imperfect, it has  many
strengths, particularly its level of consumer choice and  competition, the
bounteous benefits of a genuine market largely  unavailable to workers and their
families in employer-based  insurance. Compared with Medicare, the levels of
bureaucracy and  regulation are very low. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Wide Choice.</B> Unlike most employees or Medicare 
beneficiaries who are locked into an inflexible standardized benefits  package
pre-determined for them by an employer or the government,  Members of Congress
can choose from a broad range of health  insurance options. Not only are they
allowed to choose from a  wide variety of private plans, with a variety of
prices and benefits,  but they also pocket the savings that result from their
own choices.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excellent Cost Control.</B> While Americans typically are  being
herded into health care plans at their employers' discretion in  order to cut
down on corporate costs, Members of Congress and all  federal employees in 1996
will enjoy a solid range of benefits  and plans at insignificant premium
increases. Furthermore, many  federal employees will see no premium increases
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the government, federal workers in 1996 &quot;will find  a
total average premium increase of only four tenths of one  percent, compared to
an average private sector premium increase of  more than six percent over a
comparable  period.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#40">40</A>  For
1995, premiums actually declined on average by 3.3 percent.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Helpful Information for Making Choices.</B> The federal  government also
assists Members of Congress and federal workers and  retirees with unbiased
information on various health plans. But this  most often is not the chief
source of information on plan options.  A whole private-sector information
explosion has accompanied  the FEHBP. Members of Congress and federal workers
and  retirees can get helpful tips and advice from private-sector 
organizations, unions, and employee associations on the best plans available  to
workers, retirees, and their families in terms of value, quality,  and price.
For congressional and federal retirees, the National  Association of Retired
Federal Employees, which represents over  500,000 active and retired personnel,
suggests the best plans for those  needing specialized medical services.<I>
Washington Consumers  Checkbook</I>, a major publication available in

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Portability.</B> Within the federal workforce, there
are many  different functions and many different jobs. Federal workers can move 
from one job to another, or from one federal agency or department  to another,
and keep their health insurance plans. While  federal workers have a chance to
change insurance plans once a year,  most are satisfied with the quality and
service that their plans  provide them. If they belong to a union or an employee
organization,  they may wish  as approximately one-third of them now do  to 
retain their union-sponsored or employee organization-sponsored  health
insurance plan. Moreover, federal workers, unlike an  increasingly large number
of workers in the private sector, can take their  health insurance plan with
them when they retire, even if they retire  early at age 55. Because they have
this level of portability in their  insurance, they do not suffer the same kinds
of anxieties that  commonly plague workers and their families in the private
sector.

</P>
<P><B>The FEHBP as a Model for Health Care Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicare.</B> The basic market principles of consumer choice  and
competition that underlie the FEHBP are at the heart of  congressional efforts
to reform Medicare. Many of the key features  that federal workers and retirees
now find so attractive in the  FEHBP are incorporated in the congressional
reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>First, like retired Members of Congress and federal workers,  Medicare
beneficiaries would be given a choice. They could keep  traditional Medicare, if
they wish, or they could choose from a  full range of qualified private health
care plans, including an  alternative fee-for-service plan; a managed care plan,
such as an HMO  or Preferred Provider Option; a &quot;provider service network&quot;
plan  (a plan run directly by physicians or hospitals); plans sponsored  by
private organizations or employers; or a special medical  savings account option
coupled with catastrophic health insurance  coverage. Like plans that compete
today for the dollars of retired  Members of Congress and federal workers, these
plans would have  to meet similar consumer protection, fiscal solvency, and core
 benefit requirements. In fact, the addition of the medical savings  account
option, which would allow Medicare beneficiaries to deposit  a significant
portion of the government contribution to a  tax-free account to pay routine
medical expenses, is a distinct  improvement over the current FEHBP, which does
not yet have a medical  savings account option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, like retired Members of Congress and federal  workers, senior
citizens could get better value for their money in a  competitive health
insurance market. Medicare currently spends  about 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  $4,800 per year for each
beneficiary. Under the congressional  reform plan, it would increase to $7,100
by the year 2002. Just  as federal workers and retirees get a specific
government  contribution for the purchase of private insurance in the FEHBP,
Medicare  beneficiaries would get a specific government contribution. With  this
contribution, not only could they choose the plan or option  best suited to
their personal needs, but they also could pocket the  savings of their personal
choices, getting cash rebates from the use  of medical savings accounts and
other private plans. In other  words, the congressional Medicare reform
proposal, by enabling  Medicare beneficiaries to pick and choose their plans and
options just  as federal workers and retirees do, introduces economic  dynamics
that are similar to those which drive the popular FEHBP. For  the past several
years especially, these dynamics have served to  improve the quality of health
care services and to hold premium  costs down below those of both the private
sector and the Medicare  program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming the Private Insurance Market</B>. The success of  the FEHBP is
not due to some mysterious managerial expertise  concentrated among bureaucrats
at the Office of Personnel  Management. It is due largely to the fact that
market forces do most of  the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; in this unusual, but
popular, system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 35-year experience of the FEHBP shows that individual  consumers,
properly armed with information, can make rational  health care insurance
choices. That experience also shows that  intense and direct competition among
insurance companies for  consumers' dollars can help control costs, just as
costs are controlled in  other sectors of the economy. On this basis, Members of
Congress  could construct a consumer choice health care system for every  Ameri
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  can that resembles, in its broad
outlines, the kind of  consumer choice and competition that is now enjoyed
almost exclusively  by Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees. But
to  do this, Congress will have to take very specific steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     First, Congress should establish neutrality in the
federal tax  code.</B> This could be done in one of two ways. The best way,
within  the context of reform, would be by enacting a flat tax. This means  that
there would be no tax advantage for insurance or for health  care services,
whether purchased through one's place of employment  or some other way. And
there would be no tax on the earnings of  savings accounts for health care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Alternatively, every American family could get tax relief, in  the form of
a tax credit or a voucher, for the purchase of health  insurance or health care
services, regardless of the breadwinner's  place or status of employment. This
tax relief would be given to  individuals and families to use in a fashion that
best meets their  personal needs and circumstances: to offset the purchase of 
health insurance, out-of-pocket medical expenses, or the deposit of  funds in a
medical savings account, a tax-free account like an  individual retirement
account (IRA) in which funds roll over year after  year and from which
individuals or families could pay routine  medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Second, if households are to receive special tax
relief in the  form of credits or vouchers, the head of every household should
have  to purchase at least a basic package of catastrophic health  insurance.</B>
As with the FEHBP, Congress could set basic ground rules  for health insurance
or certify similar ground rules developed by  the states, including the
guaranteed renewability of health  insurance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  policies; a limitation on
exclusions for pre-existing medical  conditions; and limited underwriting of
health insurance that  is grounded in age, sex, and geography and provides for 
premium discounts for individuals or families who enroll in  preventive health
care or health promotion programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These tax and insurance changes would have a dramatic effect  by changing
today's health insurance market into a consumer  choice system. Like the FEHBP,
the private health insurance  market would benefit from intense competition
among private  insurance carriers, leading to an explosion of group insurance
options  outside of the place of employment and enabling trade associations, 
professional organizations, unions, employee organizations,  churches, and
religious institutions to sponsor their own health  insurance options for
workers and their families. Like the FEHBP, such  a market would put a premium
on the demand for information  on quality, price, and benefit. Outcomes research
would be in  demand for doctors and hospitals and medical groups. Consumer 
organizations and affinity groups, like the American Association of  Retired
Persons (AARP), would monitor performance and evaluate  different health plan
options and their doctors and hospitals.

<P>
</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration will long be remembered for its  attempt and
subsequent failure to federalize the American  health care system in 1994.
Criticizing the current system as wasteful  and bureaucratic, the Administration
initially enjoyed the support  of Americans in principle when it promised
security, simplicity,  sav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ings, choice, quality, and
personal responsibility. Moreover,  the President argued that sound reform
should be based on the  market principles of consumer choice and competition.
But the  record showed that President Clinton's costly, 1,342-page Health 
Security Act, an enormously complex and bureaucratic measure, was  anything but
an improvement over the current system. On the  contrary, and despite the
repeated denials of Administration  officials to this day, the Clinton
Administration's huge and complex  health reform legislation attempted to bring
one-seventh of the  U.S. economy under government control.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#41">41</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the subject of Medicare, President Clinton has refused to  consider any
major reform since the 1994 election. Rather than  overhaul the program so that
it can provide benefits to the next  generation, the Clinton Administration
Medicare reform plan  would achieve modest budget savings largely through even
tighter  controls on doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to Guy King, a spokesman for the prestigious  American Academy of
Actuaries and former Actuary of the Health Care  Financing Administration
(HCFA), &quot;It is similar to the quick  fixes enacted in the past that have
allowed the Medicare program to  fall into its current financial state. This
proposal also includes  accounting tricks to achieve short term fiscal soundness
in the  hospital insurance program. In the long run, these tricks may undermine 
the economic discipline of the trust fund.&quot;<A

</P>
<P><B>THE 104th CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the first session of the 104th Congress, federal  lawmakers took
important steps to improve the functioning of the  American 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  health care system. Of the
several legislative proposals  introduced to reform the current health system,
the most important was one  to reform the financially troubled Medicare program.
Virtually all  of the others were narrow adjustments in existing law or 
incremental reform proposals. Some of the key changes, including  Medicare
reform, were incorporated into the Balanced Budget Act of  1995, which was
vetoed by President Clinton on December 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicare. </B>In the fall of 1995, Congress passed  sweeping
Medicare reform which would have given the elderly  real choices in their health
care delivery for the first time while  taking important steps to stave off
bankruptcy and help restore  financial solvency to the program. While these
reforms are both  important and necessary, however, taxpayers should realize
that, despite  the level of bitter controversy surrounding them, they still fall
far  short of a permanent fix for the financially troubled Medicare  system.
They are serious structural changes, but still merely defer the  financial
collapse of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund  until 2010. Baby boomers
make up a huge bloc of future retirees, but  no one age 49 and under is
guaranteed, under any of the  proposals offered for congressional consideration
in 1995, that the  current Medicare program will be available upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of the key elements embodied in the vetoed  congressional Medicare
reforms include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  An option to pick private plans.</B> The legislation
offers  beneficiaries the option of enrolling in a private health plan as an 
alternative to traditional Medicare. These private plans are referred to  as &quot;MedicarePlus&quot;
plans. MedicarePlus plans include 1) a  coordinated care plan (HMO, PPO);  2) a
combination of a high-deductible plan and contributions to  a high-deductible
Medicare medical savings account; 3) plans  offered by a Provider-Sponsored
Organization (PSO); 4) a  union, Taft-Hartley, or qualified association plan;
and 5) a  fee-for-service plan that reimburses providers on the basis of a
privately  determined fee schedule. Groups such as the American Association  of
Retired Persons (AARP), United Auto Workers (UAW),  and churches could sponsor
health plans under the MedicarePlus  program. By introducing a much greater
degree of consumer  choice within a competitive market, the reform could be
expected to  reduce the rate of increase in Medicare spending. Traditional 
Medicare would remain available as an option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  A defined contribution.</B> One of the key elements in the 
congressional reform proposal is to turn Medicare benefits into a  defined
contribution from the government towards the purchase of  a MedicarePlus plan,
as opposed to today's open-ended  entitlement to specific services.
Congressional budget projections indicate  that the amount available for
retirees would rise from $4,800 to  $7,100 per capita from 1995 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the reform, the federal government would make  monthly premium
payments to the MedicarePlus plan chosen by the  beneficiary. To ensure
stability in payments to MedicarePlus plans,  the government's contribution
levels would be adjusted to  recognize legitimate variations in the costs of
doing business in  different geographic areas. If beneficiaries wished a more
generous  plan, they would have to pay the difference. But if they chose a  more
economical plan that cost less than the defined contribution,  they would be
allowed to receive 75 percent of the difference, with  the remaining 25 percent
being deposited in the HI trust fund. If  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  enrollee elected a medical
savings account (MSA) option, the  entire rebate would be deposited into that
individual's MSA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  A new Medicare trust fund.</B> Liberals in Congress claimed  that
projected savings from the reform would be used to pay for  tax cuts. This is
incorrect. The Medicare reform created a &quot;lock  box&quot; mechanism to
place all savings from the Part B program into  a new Medicare Preservation
Trust Fund and specifically  prohibit any transfers to pay for future tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Creation of Provider-Sponsored Organizations and other  group plans.</B>
To make Medicare more competitive, the  congressional reform created a new
option for the elderly to purchase their  health insurance  Provider-Sponsored
Organizations (PSOs). These  are managed care plans created primarily by
physicians and  hospitals. In addition to expanding the range of choices and
creating  more competition within the MedicarePlus program, it is widely 
believed that providers (physicians and hospitals) in smaller  communities would
be better able to find efficiencies in providing  access to health care than
some of the more traditional insurers.  Certain rules applied to the PSOs are
not applicable to other  private plans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#43">43</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicaid. </B>According to the Congressional  Budget Office,
the federal government alone spent $89.2 billion in  FY 1995 on Medicaid.
Medicaid costs have been exploding.  Like Medicare, Medicaid is plagued with
internal inefficiencies, as  well as rising costs. And as with Medicare, failure
to address  these problems translates into direct and painful tax increases  on
America's working families. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing
program within the federal budget.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Governors have testified before Congress about the  increasing strain that
exploding Medicaid costs impose on their  respective budgets, often restricting
investment in such other crucial  human service programs as child welfare,
education, public safety,  and judicial services. Responding to this financial
crisis,  Congress passed a block grant reform proposal which would enable states
 to provide medical assistance to low-income individuals and  families with a
much greater degree of flexibility. Allowing the states  to determine who is
eligible under their new programs would  eliminate the bureaucratic morass that
has resulted in mandatory  coverage for individuals whose needs are no greater,
and often are  less, than those of others for whom coverage is  prohibited.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this measure. The main difference  between the
vetoed block grant proposal and the current program  is that states would have
been given much wider latitude in  determining which segment of the population
is eligible for the new  program. States were permitted to cover any individuals
up to  250 percent of the federal poverty level. In 1995, this would  have meant
up to $31,475 for a family of three. Under the  congressional reform measure,
the states would be required to cover two  groups of qualifying individuals:
pregnant women and children aged  12 and younger living in families with income
below the federal  poverty level, and disabled individuals (as determined by the
state).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>States also would have been required to meet minimum  spending obligations
for each of three specific groups of beneficiaries:  1) families with income
below 185 percent of poverty with a  pregnant woman or child; 2) elderly
individuals; and 3) disabled  individuals. For each group, the minimum
percentage each state  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  be obligated to spend is 85
percent of the amount the states  were required to spend on mandatory services
(including nursing  facility services) under current Medicaid law during FY
1995. The 85  percent requirement also would apply to payments for Medicare 
premium assistance for low-income elderly persons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Special Needs of Children.</B> The legislation recognized the  unique
needs of children with special health care problems. Children  with serious
chronic conditions or disabilities such as cerebral  palsy, cystic fibrosis,
cancer, or heart conditions represent  approximately two percent of all children
in America. Despite their  relatively small numbers, however, the intensity of
care provided to  this population is high and requires particular attention.
Therefore,  the congressional Medicaid reform required states to outline  their
plans for providing care to children in their jurisdictions with  special health
care needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the congressional reform proposal, states were required  to include
descriptions of their objectives, goals, and methods  employed to achieve such
results. With regard to objectives  and goals, the states were to be allowed to
take into consideration  their financial resources, economic conditions,
adequacy of  existing infrastructure, and  most important  their own particular 
priorities. Current legal protections designed to protect the spouses  and adult
children of nursing home residents against  impoverishment were maintained in
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Nursing Care Standards</B>. While the elderly constitute less  than 25
percent of the Medicaid population, the mounting costs  associated with
long-term nursing care account for approximately  70 percent of the program's

that were passed in the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987).
OBRA  1987 reformed the Medicaid requirements for nursing homes  participating

these quality assurance provisions,  which include the following:

percent to 30 percent. The bill  was signed into law by President Clinton.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#46">46</A>  The Balanced Budget  Act of
1995, vetoed by the President, also included an  amendment which would gradually
increase the 30 percent deduction to  50 percent between 1996 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medical Savings Accounts.</B> The Balanced Budget Act included  a
provision to allow Americans to establish medical savings  accounts (MSAs). This
revolutionary change in health care  financing promises to have a significant
impact on the functioning of  the health insurance market. Contributions of up
to $2,000 for  individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer 
contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income. 
Interest earned on the income is subject to taxation.  Withdrawals made for
non-medical expenditures would be included in  the individual's gross income and
subject to a 10 percent tax  before age 59 and a half. After that, withdrawals
could be made for  any purpose without the 10 percent tax. For a health plan to
be  classified as a catastrophic coverage plan, the minimum  deductible would
have to be $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Improving Portability of Coverage.</B> Representative Bill  Thomas
(R-CA) introduced a bill (H.R. 1610) to end the problem of  &quot;job lock&quot;
that has been created under employment-based health  insurance systems. The
legislation would allow individuals  moving from one job to another to remain
continuously covered even  if they suffered from pre-existing medical
conditions. With the  use of pre-existing condition exclusions by insurers thus
limited,  individuals moving from one employer group health plan to  another
would not normally be subject to such exclusions. At the end  of the first
session, this bill was pending in the full Committee  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A similar bill (S.1028) was introduced in the Senate by  Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS). Like the Thomas bill, S. 1028  would limit exclusions for
pre-existing conditions. By prohibiting  health plans from limiting or denying
coverage for more than 12  months for a medical condition that was diagnosed or
treated during  the previous six months, it is intended to alleviate some of the
 burdens facing workers trapped in an employment-based health  system. The bill
also would modify the Consolidated Omnibus  Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA).
Under current law, COBRA states  that workers in a firm with over 20 employees
can remain insured  between jobs by continuing their enrollment in the company's
 plan, paying the premiums themselves, for 18 months after they  leave the
company. Coverage for spouses and dependent children  remains in effect for a
total of 36 months in cases of death or  divorce. S.1028 extends the length of
coverage under  COBRA. While this is viewed by some as a consumer protection
measure,  it has potentially harmful effects because it would increase the 
costs of health insurance to employers who ultimately pass on any  additional
costs to active employees. In general, healthy  ex-employees decline COBRA
coverage while high risk ex-employees  accept and pay directly for coverage.
However, the employer is  required to pay the actual claims costs for former
workers who elect  COBRA coverage.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased Incentives for Long-Term Care Insurance.</B> Included  in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was a provision which  would encourage individuals
to purchase private long-term care  insurance. By allowing tax-free withdrawals
from an individual  retirement account (IRA) and other pension plans to purchase
 private 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  long-term care insurance, it
would help alleviate the financial  pressures of the Medicaid program, which
spent $14.5 billion in  FY 1990 for nursing home care alone.

<P><B>Increased Delivery Options for Seniors  Medicare Select.</B>  Last
summer, Congress also enacted legislation to amend the  Social Security Act to
permit so-called Medicare Select policies to  be offered in all states. The
measure was signed into law by  President Clinton. The new law would: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Provide a three-year extension of
the Medicare Select  program. Under Medicare Select, beneficiaries have the
option to  purchase their Medigap (Medicare supplemental) policies through 
managed care networks. Studies have shown that Medicare Select  products have
saved beneficiaries between 10 percent and 37 percent  in premiums over the
traditional fee-for-service Medicare  supplemental programs. This has translated
into savings of up to  $300 per year for many seniors.<A

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Fix Medicare and Medicaid.</B> The Medicare program is 
facing bankruptcy. It must be fixed, or the current and future  generations of
taxpayers will be burdened with unprecedented increases  in levels of taxation
required to sustain it. Likewise, exploding  Medicaid costs also must be brought
under control.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress passed legislation in 1995 to address these problems,  but the bill
was vetoed by President Clinton. The reforms would  have helped restore the
finances of Medicare while giving new  choices and security to the elderly. In
1997, these reforms should be  enacted into law. Clinton also vetoed structural
reform of  Medicaid  a reform which would have integrated Medicaid into the rest
 of the welfare system and given states the flexibility to find ways  of keeping
down costs by improving efficiency. This  legislation needs to be enacted in
1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt the flat tax.</B> For reasons of general tax reform, many  Members
of Congress want to overhaul the entire federal income  tax code, simplify it,
and replace it with a flat tax (either as a flat  income tax or as a sales tax).
The flat tax proposal is perhaps  the best way to bring neutrality to the tax
code and eliminate the  inequities and inefficiencies of the current tax
treatment of health  insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax, there would be no special tax exclusion on  the monetary
value of health care benefits provided through the  place of work. All health
benefits, like wages and other  compensation, would be counted as taxable income
and would be taxable at a  flat rate. Because there would be no built-in bias
toward  employment-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  based health insurance and no
discrimination against  non-employment-based health insurance, whether group or
individual,  Americans would have a powerful incentive to seek the best value 
for their money, weighing the quality and service of a benefits  package against
the price. Certainly, employers may still wish to  offer insurance or get good
group rates for their insurance; but  an employer's preferred option no longer
would have an exclusive  tax advantage, and thus would be in competition with
packages  sponsored by other organizations, including unions, trade 
associations, or other entities offering different packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A second advantage of the flat tax approach is that it  eliminates the
current tax advantage of third-party payment. Today, there  is no tax advantage
to paying for medical services directly. From  a tax position, it is best if
payment for health care services can  be accomplished through a third-party
payer. If Americans were  no longer penalized for paying directly, doctors and
hospitals  would receive cash payments more often from patients themselves. 
Moreover, cost control would be more effective; a dollar paid for  services
directly would have to be less expensive than a dollar paid  to a doctor through
the administrative apparatus of a third-party  payment system. And when
insurance companies weighed such  features as co-payment and deductibles, these
features would be  offered to consumers without the bias of the tax code
affecting  how they are determined.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax option, help for lower-income people  those  who are
ineligible for Medicaid or assistance for the unemployed   can be simplified and
secured through the adoption of a  straight voucher system. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Short of a flat tax, establish an individual tax credit for health  care
spending and MSAs.</B> If it should decide to forego reforming  the tax code by
establishing a flat tax, Congress could achieve  neutrality in the treatment of
health care by establishing an individual  tax credit to replace the current tax
exclusion for  employment-based health insurance. The amount of the tax credit
can be varied  by income level and family status to control the cost of the 
subsidy and target the benefits.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#48">48</A>
 A refundable tax credit for health  insurance, medical services, and
contributions to a medical savings  account would enable lower-income Americans
to buy into  the health insurance market on the same terms as all other 
Americans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#49">49</A>  By providing a
larger subsidy for low-income families,  a credit would encourage more people to
secure health  insurance, reduce adverse selection, and discourage free  riders.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#50">50</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A tax credit approach also has the benefit of advancing solid  welfare
reform by encouraging work and targeting the benefits of  the credit to the
segment of the population that otherwise would  remain uninsured without
Medicaid, a key element of the  welfare system. While the goal of medical
coverage for all who want  to purchase it is realized more efficiently through
tax credits, such  a system also increases the numbers in the labor force. The 
CBO confirms this: &quot;[T]he credit would also reduce the current 
disincentive for welfare recipients to enter the work force. At  present,
welfare recipients can lose most of their benefits when they go  to work.... [A]
tax credit would reduce this  penalty.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#51">51</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Comprehensive legislation establishing an individual tax  credit, The
Consumer Choice Health Security Act (H.R. 3698,  S.1743), was introduced in 1994
in the House by Representative  Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and in the Senate by
Senator Don Nickles (R-OK).
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under this approach, Americans would be able to choose a  package of health
benefits according to their needs and those of  the family. Whichever plan is
chosen by the head of household,  the family would receive tax relief, in the
form of an individual  tax credit, for the purchase of the health plan. Most of
the cost of  the tax credits would be offset by the fact that they replace the 
current tax exclusion of health benefits. Additional savings in  Medicare and
Medicaid reforms, outlined in the Nickles-Stearns bill,  would offset the
remaining costs of the new tax credit program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the tax credit would replace the current tax exclusion  for
company-sponsored health plans. This means that instead of  having a tax break
for the plan picked by his employer, a  worker would be able to claim a sliding
scale credit, based on income  or health care needs, for the plan of his
choosing, as well as for  out-of-pocket expenses and contributions to a medical
savings  account.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#52">52</A>  The tax
credits would be refundable, meaning that if  the credit actually exceeded the
family's federal tax liability, the  government would pay the difference.
Middle-income families  would benefit significantly from a tax credit approach.
A tax credit  patterned after the Nickles-Stearns legislation would mean a net 
tax cut for every income group, including the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If a head of household was satisfied with the plan already  offered by an
employer, the family could continue to be enrolled in it. If  a worker preferred
a plan offered through a different  organization, such as a union, church, or
professional association, the  employer would be required to &quot;cash out&quot;
the actuarial value of the  worker's current benefits and give the money to the
employee to use  for another health plan. Under the legislation, employers would
 have 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  to offer employees the right to
convert their current health  plans into individual policies, which employees
then would own.  Employers also would be required to add the value of their 
current coverage to the worker's wages, with each worker then able to  use the
money either to pay for the company-sponsored plan or to  buy coverage from an
alternative source. To make the system  simpler for employees, and to ensure
timely premium payments,  employers would be responsible for directing premium
payments (just  as they currently do for the company plan) to the health plans 
designated by their employees. Employers also would adjust  tax withholdings to
reflect the credit available to employees. If  a worker became unemployed, the
family would receive a  refundable tax credit (voucher) to offset the cost of
the designated  plan. Workers and their families would have health care
security,  since they would be able to own their health coverage and take it 
with them if they changed jobs, even during a spell of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the insurance system.</B> Tax reform does not eliminate  the
necessity of making certain changes in the rules governing  the health insurance
market. Companies should not exclude a  person from coverage because of
pre-existing illness or drop a person  because he gets sick; thus, there should
be both limitations on  such exclusions and guaranteed renewability of
insurance.  Moreover, underwriting procedures, and hence premiums, should
reflect  age, gender, and geographic location. Insurance companies,  however,
also should be able to offer premium discounts to individuals  who enroll in
programs to promote healthy lifestyles, or for  checkups and other steps taken
to detect or prevent illness. Ideally,  these reforms of the health insurance
market should be effected at  the state level.

<P><B>Short-Term Reforms</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Short of comprehensive health care reform based on overhaul  of the tax
system and free-market reforms, Congress can  pursue short-term, or incremental,
reforms. The central problem with  the incremental approach is that if it is not
done carefully and  deliberately, reform measures can lead in any conceivable
direction.  Liberals in Congress who have sponsored the Clinton plan or 
legislation establishing a Canadian-style system have a very clear goal:  a
government-run, highly regulated national health care system.  Unless
conservatives have an equally clear sense of where they  are going, they may end
up supporting short-term measures that  actually move the country closer to the
liberals' ideological  goal. Therefore, conservatives ought to evaluate any
proposal by  asking whether it promotes a genuine free market in health care; 
promotes real consumer choice and genuine competition; empowers  patients to
make the key decisions concerning their choice of  physician, insurance plan,
and benefit options; gives employees and  their families direct control over
their own health care dollars;  gives workers and their families the right to
own their own health  insurance plan and enables them to take it with them
wherever they  go; and reduces the bureaucratic overregulation and paperwork 
requirements characteristic of the current health care  system.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#53">53</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are several reforms that would move toward a health  care system that
is more secure and controlled by families rather  than employers, insurance
companies, or the government: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Permit self-employed individuals 100 percent tax
deductibility  for health insurance.</B> The self-employed currently are allowed
to  deduct up to 30 percent of health insurance costs. While the  Bal
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  anced Budget Act of 1995 would
increase this to 50 percent  over the next 7 years, true tax fairness would
place individually  purchased plans and employment-based health insurance on the
 same level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require employers to disclose to workers the true cost of  employee
health benefits.</B> A huge obstacle to serious health care  reform is that too
many Americans think that their employer is  paying for their health care.
While, under an employer-based  system, the employer becomes the means for
transmission of  premium payment and takes a tax deduction for doing so, the
truth is  that households bear 100 percent of health care costs. This simple 
reform would give workers a clearer understanding of just  how much of their
compensation goes to cover health care costs.  It could be accomplished by
requiring a periodic statement on  the employee's pay stub specifying both the
amount the employer  has paid in health care benefits and the corresponding
amount  by which his cash wages and other compensation have been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allow employers and employees to contribute to flexible  spending
accounts that can be rolled over from year to year.</B> Many  firms allow
employees to contribute pre-tax income to a flexible  spending account, which
can be used to pay for out-of-pocket  medical expenses. Unspent end-of-the-year
balances, however, cannot  be rolled over; they revert to the employer. The new
Congress  should change the law and permit these nontaxable accounts to be 
rolled over tax free from year to year. If an employee leaves a firm, he  or she
should be able to retain the tax-free account for medical  costs in the form of
a medical savings or health security account.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Promote medical malpractice reform.</B> Medical malpractice  costs 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  have contributed to increased
medical costs. In conjunction  with medical malpractice litigation, the current
legal system allows  unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. 
Non-economic damages do not include compensation for medical costs, 
rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses.  The fear
of frivolous malpractice suits has driven approximately  75 percent of all
doctors to perform unnecessary tests because of  the threat of liability.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#54">54</A>  The House passed legislation to
limit  non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice, but  the
measure died in the Senate under intense pressure from trial  lawyers' groups
and the threat of a filibuster spearheaded by  Senate liberals. Medical
malpractice and tort reform should be  addressed in 1997, but preferably at the
state level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt antitrust reform.</B> &quot;Safe harbors&quot; from federal
anti-trust  laws should be created for certain groups of doctors, hospitals, 
and other medical providers; for medical self-regulatory entities that  do not
operate for financial gain; for certain joint ventures  involving high
technology and costly equipment and services; for  certain hospital mergers; and
for health care joint ventures that would  increase access to health care and
enhance health care quality.  Current antitrust laws prohibit such arrangements,
and thus  frustrate efficiencies in the system which would reduce health care 
costs and benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similar reforms were passed by the 104th Congress as part of  the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995. These reforms are needed to  allow the creation of
Provider-Sponsored Organizations (PSOs) as  another health plan option for
elderly and disabled beneficiaries,  thus adding to the available choices in the
private sector for senior  citizens. Rural areas especially would benefit from
the creation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  PSOs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>As a condition of any insurance reform at the federal level,  eliminate
state-mandated benefits.</B> The health insurance industry is  one of the most
highly regulated sectors of the American  economy. But regulation of health
insurance usually is within the  jurisdiction of the state, not the federal
government. A key component of  state regulation is the imposition of mandated
benefits on  insurance firms licensed at the state level. These mandates are the
product  of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where  medical
specialists and practitioners have succeeded in imposing  coverage requirements.
Over the years, the number and scope of these  benefits have grown
substantially, adding to the cost of  insurance plans sold to employers and
employees. Nationwide, there are  over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from
in vitro fertilization  to chiropractic care and psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at  the federal
level. But in reforming the federal tax code to establish  an individual tax
credit or voucher system, Congress could  specify that the only legal
requirement for securing a tax credit is that  any plan receiving the proceeds
of such a credit must include  catastrophic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress should find it necessary to intervene in the  regulation of
insurance, this reform could be accomplished through  federal preemption,
requiring only catastrophic coverage for health  insurance. Such a measure would
substantially reduce the cost of  insurance for small business at the state and
local levels. It also  would allow for more pooling of insurance and ensure
consumer  protection against underinsurance, which is the true meaning of a loss
 or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  absence of catastrophic coverage.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if the comprehensive congressional reform measure had  not been vetoed,
however, significant problems would remain in  traditional Medicare and would
need to be addressed. Among them:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Taxpayer burdens for Part B are still too high.</B> The  Medicare
supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program, also known  as Part B, is
voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll by paying  a monthly premium 
currently $42.50 per month. This amount  is approximately 25 percent of the
program's costs today. Most  of the debate on Medicare has focused on the
impending  bankruptcy of the trust fund in Part A of the program, the part that 
reimburses hospitals. But in terms of the growing fiscal pressure on  working
families to sustain Medicare, a more serious problem is Part  B, which has been
growing at 12.5 percent a year. Under the  traditional arrangement that the
taxpayer pick up 75 percent or more  of program costs  the position supported by
the Clinton  Administration and liberals in Congress  the CBO projects that the 
taxpayer burden to finance Medicare Part B over five years will be  $589.7
billion over the next seven years (1996-2002). This amount  easily surpasses the
Clinton tax increase of $262 billion between  1994 and 1998, the largest tax
increase in American history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reforms passed by the House and Senate in 1995 and  vetoed by President
Clinton would have frozen the Part B  beneficiary contribution at the current
rate of 31.5 percent at least  through 2002. This is an improvement, but it
still would not fully  address the crushing future tax burden facing America's
working  families. Under every scenario, that burden will increase sharply, 
especially when the nation's 77 million baby boomers begin to retire.   
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the original contract  with America's
taxpayers was that they would pay for 50 percent of  the program's cost. That
contract between Congress and the  taxpayers was broken by Congress, leaving the
taxpayers to pay an  increasingly disproportionate share of the cost. Congress
should  restore the Part B premium to 50 percent of program costs for  average
Americans, as originally intended. More affluent  Americans should receive no
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress should allow patients to contract privately with  doctors,
hospitals, and other medical providers.</B> Private contracting  arrangements
help both the beneficiary and the taxpayer. Under  such an arrangement, no
Medicare reimbursement claims would be  filed because none would be sought
either by the provider or by the  patient. This would occur at no cost to
insurance companies or  federal taxpayers. Second, beneficiaries would be free
to receive  their health care from any provider they chose without government 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many elderly and disabled persons, for a variety of personal  reasons, have
expressed to their physicians a desire to keep the  federal government
completely out of the picture. However,  Section 1848(g)(4)(A)(i) of the Social
Security Act requires health  care providers to &quot;[c]omplete and submit a
claim for such services on  a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to
the carrier  on behalf of a beneficiary.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#55">55</A>  Surprisingly, the Department of 
Health and Human Services, which is responsible for enforcing this  statute, has
failed to put forth a clear policy against private  contracting. In <I>Stewart
v. Sullivan</I><U>,</U> 816 F. Supp. 281 (1992), federal  judge Nicholas
Politan ruled that the Secretary of Health and  Human 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Services had not articulated a
clear policy against private  contracting; thus, given the discrepancy between
statutory law and  existing case law, physicians remain uncertain as to which
law prevails  and fearful of possible reprisals from bureaucrats at HCFA who 
periodically threaten sanctions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should end this confusion, stop HCFA's  bureaucratic threats, and
protect the right of private contract and the integrity  of the doctor-patient
relationship.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> True portability comes only from owning your own  insurance
policy, much as you own your own life, auto, or homeowner's  insurance policy.
Under employer-based insurance, the  employer, not the employee, owns the
policy. Therefore, when a  worker changes his job or loses his job, he can't
take the policy with  him. Insurance regulation, while mitigating the
circumstances of  job changes or transfers, cannot establish personal ownership
of  health insurance policies. That is why insurance reforms can only 
approximate portability, a pale imitation of the real thing. Only  reforming the
tax code can change this arrangement, giving the  individual direct tax relief
for the purchase of insurance and  enabling the consumer to purchase his own
policy and keep it, regardless  of where he works.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The health care system cannot be reformed unless you reform  the market for
health insurance, and the market for health  insurance cannot be reformed unless
you reform the tax treatment of  health insurance. The federal tax code
profoundly shapes and drives  the current system, distorts the health care
market, and frustrates  the market forces of consumer choice and competition.
The states  can change insurance regulation; they can change the rules 
governing the licensing of doctors and hospitals or other medical  providers;
but they cannot change the federal tax code, and thus alter the  basic dynamics
of the health care system. Unfortunately, too  many state health care reform
measures make matters worse by  adding even more mandates and imposing price
controls on doctors  and hospitals, further frustrating the market forces of
consumer  choice and competition.

</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives insist on reducing Medicare spending  to achieve
a balanced budget? </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> In spite of the partisan rhetoric, both the White House and 
Congress know that it is not mathematically possible to balance  the federal
budget without also slowing the growth in Medicare  spending. But even if the
federal budget were balanced, the current  level of Medicare spending  now
almost 11 percent per year   cannot be sustained. It inevitably will impose huge
tax increases on  working Americans or drain federal funding from other vital 
government programs. Writing in the prestigious 
<I>New England Journal of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  Medicine</I> in 1992, President
Clinton himself said that the  current and projected level of Medicare spending
was &quot;unacceptable.&quot;   Curiously, the congressional proposal to reduce
Medicare  spending to roughly twice the rate of inflation is similar to the 
proposal advanced by the President in 1993, when neither the federal  budget nor
the solvency of the Medicare trust fund was a pressing  issue for the White
House and the President was proposing to  use the savings from Medicare to
finance the Administration's  health care plan. A noteworthy difference is that
all of the Medicare  savings under the congressional plan would be plowed back 
into Medicare itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why, then, was there such a huge gap between the $128  billion the
White House plan proposed to save in Medicare and the  $270 billion proposed by
Congress? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There wasn't. The President's plan used its own rosy OMB 
assumptions of baseline expenditures (that is, under current  law). Because OMB
assumed a slower growth in Medicare spending,  the President had to cut less to
reach virtually the same actual  spending levels. Congress used the bipartisan
Congressional  Budget Office baseline, and so needed to save $270 billion over 
seven years. If one uses different baselines, one gets different  results. When
one uses the same baseline, the difference between  the White House and
congressional figures shrinks dramatically.  Using the CBO baseline, the White
House savings of $128  billion balloon into $192 billion, a difference with
Congress of $78  billion over seven years, or a little more that $11 billion a
year.  Taking premium charges into account, a Heritage Foundation analysis  of
the two proposals indicates that the real gap between the  White House and
Congress would be only $20.7 billion in spending  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 -->  seven years, or about one percent
of current Medicare  outlays.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#56">56</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The appearance of a large gap thus is based on the use of  different
baselines in the same media reports on the competing plans. It's  as if the
White House says the temperature today is 0 degrees  Celsius but Congress says
it is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and so seems to  create an unbridgeable 32 degree
difference. Mixing OMB and  CBO baselines is tantamount to mixing Celsius and
Fahrenheit  measures of temperature, and is equally misleading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to push the elderly all into  managed care?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no plan to do so. The congressional Medicare  reform
plan does make managed care an option, but it also enables  the elderly to
choose other options, including fee-for-service plans  or medical savings
accounts, as well as traditional Medicare. In  any case, the Congressional
Budget Office, in examining the  likelihood of enrollment changes, estimated
that about 24 percent of  Medicare beneficiaries would belong to HMOs in 2002,
an increase  of about 10 percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#57">57</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why raise Medicare premiums to pay for a tax cut for  wealthy
Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums paid  by
beneficiaries do not finance the tax relief provisions in the  Balanced Budget
Act of 1995. The Balanced Budget Act sought  to maintain the calendar year 1995
ratio of SMI premium  collections to program costs at 31.5 percent. Since
enrollment in the SMI  program is voluntary, an increase in premiums is not a
tax increase  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  those who choose to take
advantage of a taxpayer subsidy.  The premium  $42.50 per month as of January 1,
1996  is  equivalent to just 25 percent of the actual cost of the Part B
program.  The remaining 75 percent is paid for by taxpayers out of the  general
revenue fund. When Congress established Medicare Part B  in 1966, it created a
taxpayer subsidy for the premiums paid by  the nation's elderly, setting it at
50 percent of the program's cost.  As you can see, Congress created a subsidy
for the nation's  elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is currently
the case. It  is ironic that most of the uninsured workers in America are forced
 to subsidize health care for the elderly through the mandatory  Medicare
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Haven't we heard before that the Medicare system is bankrupt?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, you have. The Medicare Board of Trustees have  been warning
Congress for years that the Hospital Insurance (HI, or  Part A) Trust Fund will
be exhausted by the year 2002. During both  the Reagan and Bush Administrations,
Congress was told  repeatedly that corrective action was necessary to avoid huge
tax increases  on working families or a reduction in benefits of similar 
proportions. Congress chose to ignore these warnings. For example, 
Representative Sam Gibbons (D-FL), former Chairman of the House  Ways and Means
Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare,  says the insolvency issue is
greatly exaggerated: &quot;I've read these  trustees' reports for years. They're
all pessimistic. I don't panic  over the insolvency question.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#58">58</A>  Even President Clinton 
acknowledged the impending crisis in an address to a joint session of  Congress,
seeking to maintain the 1995 calendar year ratio of premium  collections to
program outlays with a 27 percent  ceiling.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#59">59</A>  While the 27 percent ceiling
perpetuates a generous taxpayer subsidy to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  elderly, it is a modest
improvement over current law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do Republicans want to force senior citizens into  Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Republicans do not want to force senior citizens into  HMOs. The
Medicare reform proposal contained within the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995
assumes that the elderly should be allowed to  enroll in a plan with health
services and benefits that they  choose, not just one with options prescribed by
bureaucrats or politicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Program (FEHBP), which
covers approximately 1.6 million retired  federal workers, including former
Members of Congress, the  congressional proposal expands the opportunities for
individual  choice. Enrollees would be able to choose either traditional
Medicare or  a private plan in the MedicarePlus program. For an enrollee  who
chose to enroll in MedicarePlus, the choices available would  include a private
fee-for-service plan, a union plan, a  Taft-Hartley plan, a managed care option
(HMO, PPO, etc.), a  high-deductible policy combined with a medical savings
account (MSA), or a  plan offered through a church or an association such as the
 American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't I entitled to every penny that I paid into Medicare?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. Many elderly Americans wrongly assume they  are
getting back what they paid into the system. However, many  seniors are getting
back much more than they contributed,  assuming they contributed at all. The
Medicare health benefit package  offered in future years will be worth more than
the current  program, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  which is much more valuable than
the one offered in past  years.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#60">60</A>
 Since Medicare benefits are open-ended by design, their value  has risen
consistently over time. The average benefit (Parts A and  B) per enrollee was
worth approximately $4,800 in 1995.  According to the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), which  oversees and administers Medicare, spending is
expected to  continue rising at such a rapid pace that the total expected value
of  Medicare benefits for a couple retiring at age 65 in 1995 is  over $185,000.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#61">61</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of the workforce  supporting the
current system is scheduled to retire beginning in  2010. The approximate ratio
of workers to people 65 or over is 4:7;  by the year 2030, only two workers will
be supporting each  beneficiary. Given the trust funds' inadequate reserves and
weak  financing structure, unless reforms are instituted, workers will  face
higher taxes to finance the subsidy enjoyed by current  beneficiaries.

<a name="ISSUES">

<P><b>THE ISSUES</b>
<P>
<P>Immigration has re-emerged as one of the nation's more 
controversial political issues. In 1994, California's Proposition 187, 
designed to deny welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, received 
a resounding 59 percent of the vote, and a special Commission 
on Immigration Reform issued a report supporting a national 
computerized registration system for all workers to help enforce 
laws against the employment of illegal aliens. Legislation to 
strengthen law enforcement against illegal immigration and restrict the 
quota of legal immigrants is being considered in Congress. 
Candidates for public office in 1996 are very likely to be asked to take a 
position on immigration issues.
<P>
<P>One reason for this concern is the widespread impression that 
immigrants who come to America to take advantage of welfare 
contribute to the urban crime rate. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many people worry that recent immigrants are changing 
the face of America ethnically, culturally, and politically. 
Immigration from European countries is much smaller than in earlier 
years, while Hispanic and Asian immigration is much greater.
<P>
<P>Not only is the number of new immigrants under current law at 
an all-time high, but the concentration of these new Americans in 
five 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

states -- California, Florida, Illinois, Texas, and New York --  
significantly magnifies their impact on local government 
services, including schools, emergency medical care, and welfare.
<P>
<P>The changing skills of immigrants also raise concerns. The 
proportion of highly skilled immigrants has declined in the past decade 
as the proportion of immigrants sponsored by close family 
members has increased. Refugees from political repression or ethnic 
persecution often arrive in this country without skills or other 
 resources and automatically are placed on welfare.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a particularly sensitive issue for 
many Americans, one that prompts them to worry about the price 
society pays for an &quot;open door&quot; policy. Illegal immigration involves 
not only people who sneak across the U.S. border, but also those 
who come as tourists or students and decide to stay. In 1986, legal 
sanctions were imposed on employers who hire unlawful 
immigrants, but they have been difficult to enforce because identification 
documents are easily forged. Legislation pending in Congress 
would create a national identification card for every 
American,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#1">1</a> but this worries many who feel that a national identification card would 
be a dangerous intrusion by government.
<P>
<P>Opinions about the merits of America's current immigration 
policy are sharply divided. Those who believe immigrants should be 
welcomed argue that the cultural and economic contributions of 
immigrants are part of America's historical tradition and that the 
economic benefits from more workers and people who start 
businesses and pay taxes far exceed any social 
costs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#2">2</a>  Those who think the demographic change is too great, on the other hand, note that 
current levels of immigration will cause Americans from the 
Euro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->

pean ethnic groups that dominated this country for most of its 
history to become a minority of the population the middle of the 
21st century.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#3">3</a>
<P>
<P>But this is not just a political numbers game. It is an intensely 
personal issue for millions of Americans whose close family ties 
or business interests are regulated by the immigration law. 
Reuniting families is a primary goal of U.S. immigration law, and 
businesses in the rapidly growing high technology sectors of the 
U.S. economy, as well as American corporations with a 
multinational workforce, want the freedom to bring foreign-born employees 
and their families into the United States without excessive red tape.
<P>
<P>Most current immigration to the United States cannot be 
justified as bringing some general economic benefit to other Americans, 
but neither can it be attacked as an economic drain. Though 
national statistics do not clearly show any particular economic costs or 
benefits to the country as a whole,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#4">4</a> the family members and 
employers who sponsor immigrants believe very strongly in the 
economic contributions of the individuals they 
know.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#5">5</a>
<P>
<P>The abstract question  whether there is too much 
immigration today  tends to dominate the debate (along with the problem 
of illegal immigration). But the issue is hard to resolve. For 
those people directly affected, the concern is whether the 
government will permit a particular, valuable<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#6">6</a> person to live and work in 
the United States. For other Americans, the issues are less 
clear-cut. Candidates must be prepared to help their constituents 
resolve them.
<a name="FACTS"><P>
<P><B>THE FACTS

<P>
<P>Immigrants and Welfare</B>
<P>
<P>The generous welfare benefits provided by most states and 
the federal government are intended to help individuals and families 
in need. Many people take advantage of the this system to avoid 
assuming their family responsibilities and performing work. It 
certainly seems plausible that people from impoverished 
countries would want to come to the United States because of the 
higher standard of living, as well as to assume that many would come 
to be on welfare, since welfare benefits in the United States 
are higher than the incomes of most people in less developed 
countries. But there is no evidence that large numbers of working 
age immigrants come to America to go on the dole. 
<ul><P>
<li><P>The labor force participation rate among male immigrants is 
77 percent -- slightly higher than among native-born Americans 
(74 percent), according to the 1990 census. The highest labor 
force participation rate, 83 percent, is among Hispanic immigrants. 
<P>
<li>The median age for legal immigrants in 1993 was 28, 
slightly younger than the average American's age of 33. More than 80 
percent of immigrants arrive before age 45, and only about 
5 percent arrive after retirement age to join family 
members.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#7">7</a>
</ul><P>
<P>Newly arrived immigrants, &quot;legal permanent residents,&quot; 
generally are prevented from receiving welfare. They cannot receive 
most direct aid during their first three years<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#8">8</a> in the country 
because their sponsors' income is counted as their own during this 
period in determining eligibility. They also can be deported as a 
public 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->

charge if they use public benefits during their first five years in 
the country. Elderly immigrants, however, who typically are 
sponsored by their children, are able to take advantage of the 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program after five years. 
Their sponsors' financial responsibility ends, and SSI is an 
entitlement for those with a low income after age 65.
<P>
<P>The Immigration Reform Act of 1986, which established 
procedures to legalize immigrants, barred those taking advantage of 
the amnesty from receiving public benefits for five years. After 
that, they can receive welfare. Undocumented aliens are not eligible 
for most public assistance, except for emergency medical 
treatment under Medicaid and nutrition benefits under the Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The states were mandated by 
the 1986 immigration law to establish a computerized system, the 
Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), to screen 
the immigration status of non-citizen applicants for Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other federal benefit 
programs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#9">9</a>
<P>
<P>A recent study of welfare participation over a whole lifetime

<P>This trend in lifetime welfare outlays for the foreign born is 
explained by the demographic pattern of recent immigration 
rather than by a growing tendency among immigrants in general, most 
of whom are young men, to go on welfare. More elderly 
immigrants have a higher lifetime dependence on welfare benefits for 
elderly people than the native born because they have fewer resources 
in the form of Social Security, private pensions, and 
accumulated savings. In addition, the number of refugees and political 
asylum seekers coming to the United States has increased since the 
1960s, and this category of immigrants is eligible for welfare 
immediately upon arrival.
<P>
<P>Still, it is important to keep this in proportion:
<P>
<P><B>Elderly Immigrants </B>
<ul><P>
<li><P>Elderly immigrants show up on the welfare rolls in greater 
numbers than younger immigrants, or the native born. But 
immigrants over age 65 who have lived in the U.S. for at least 20 years 
are only slightly more likely to receive welfare than elderly 
natives 

(8.7 percent versus 6.9 percent). 
<P>
<li><P>Most native born recipients receive other retirement income, 
including Social Security, that is not counted as welfare. But 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available when other sources 
of income are small. For most of the elderly immigrants on SSI, 
their monthly check is their only source of 
income.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#11">11</a> 
<P>
<li><P>In 1982, there were 127,900 non-citizens receiving SSI. In 
1992, this number had increased to 601,000, equal to about 11 percent 
of the total elderly poor. It continues to increase rapidly: By 1994, 
it had climbed to 738,000.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#12">12</a>  SSI recipients also qualify for 
Medicaid, food stamps, and local welfare services.
<P></ul>
<P>Most non-citizens on SSI have relatives able to support them. 
Support is a condition of sponsorship for immigration, but after 
five years is no longer mandatory. After five years as a legal 
permanent resident, an immigrant can become a naturalized citizen, and 
no restrictions on welfare eligibility apply. Significant changes in 
the federal means-tested welfare standards were included in the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#13">13</a>  Welfare benefits for refugees 
and other &quot;qualified aliens&quot; would have ended after five years. 
The income of a sponsor would have been used to calculate 
eligibility for SSI and other means-tested entitlements, without a three- 
or five-year limit. The legislation also would have required all 
non-citizens to reapply for benefits, with the incomes of their 
sponsors to be used in the recalculation of eligibility. But even this 
regulation ends if the elderly immigrant qualifies for citizenship.

<P><B>Immigrants and Crime
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->

</B>
<P>
<P>Ethnic communities with a high proportion of immigrants 
typically are located in the inner city, where higher crime rates are 
common. The issue: Do immigrants cause crime, or do they simply tend 
to live in high crime-areas?  The notion that higher immigration 
rates and higher crime rates are causally related cannot be dismissed 
out of hand. In every ethnic group, young males commit most of 
the crime, and immigrants are predominantly young males  
particularly illegal immigrants. In the United States, moreover, 
economic opportunity often depends on education and cultural 
advantages that immigrants from poor countries do not possess. 
<P>
<P>Many Americans assume this makes immigrants more inclined 
to commit crimes. But it is wrong to assume that educational 
disadvantages and other factors mean that immigrants are more likely 
to be involved in crime than native born Americans.
<P>
<ul>
<P><li>For the nation as a whole, the number of non-citizens in prison 
is approximately the same proportion as the number from the 
general population.
<P>
<P><li>Of the five states with the largest proportion of alien prisoners 
in 1992  California, New York, Florida, Illinois, and Texas  
only New York had a greater share of non-citizens in its prisons than 
in the general population.

<P>
<P>The federal prison system has a much greater proportion of 
non-citizens (not necessarily immigrants) in custody than the state 
prisons, with approximately 25 percent. One reason for this is 
that federal law enforcement tends to concentrate on different kinds 
of crime, such as drug smuggling, in which foreigners on tourist 
or business visas are caught entering and leaving the United 
States. Federal prison statistics tell us nothing about criminality 
among immigrants. Among the non-citizens in federal prison, 80 
percent were convicted for crimes related to the war on drugs, 
including former Panama dictator Manuel Noriega.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#14">14</a> 
<P>
<P>The ethnic groups represented among non-citizen prisoners 
also have no significant correlation with the size of those 
immigrant groups in the general population. If immigration in general were 
a source of crime, we would expect to find a higher statistical 
correlation between members of specific ethnic groups in the 
prison population and their share of the general population.
<P>
<P><B>The Burden on State and Local Governments</B>
<P>
<P>Immigration policy, including the control of borders to halt 
illegal immigration, is a responsibility of the federal government. 
But state and local governments have to support public schools, 
hospitals, emergency rescue, police and fire departments, and other 
services for immigrant communities -- including many illegals 
who 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->

live and hide among the much larger legal foreign born 
population. Thus, if the federal government fails to secure America's 
borders, the states pick up the tab for illegals who receive services. 
The federal government clearly has failed to control the Mexican 
border. Moreover, the President and Congress annually set the 
quota for refugees, who are entitled to federal and local welfare 
benefits. The flood of political asylum seekers and foreign visitors 
who overstay their visa periods and melt into the population as 
illegal immigrants is entirely the result of Washington's failure to 
discharge its responsibility.
<P>
<P>Federal law requires state and local governments to provide 
public schooling<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#15">15</a> and emergency medical care for illegal 
immigrants. States have grown increasingly angry in recent years at what 
they see as an unfair financial burden placed on them by a federal 
government that is unwilling to enforce its immigration 
laws. California's Proposition 187 and other measures to deny state 
and local government services to illegal immigrants are prompted 
by the rising cost of services paid for by state 
taxpayers.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#16">16</a> 
<P>
<P>The governors of the most heavily affected states have 
demanded federal reimbursement of the estimated costs imposed by 
illegal immigration on their state and local governments. In 
Washington, this argument is made in support of legislation to strengthen 
federal immigration controls, particularly at the Mexican border, 
to stop illegal crossing.
<P>
<P>In the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress for the first 
time voted to eliminate one unfunded mandate (for emergency 
medical care, including childbirth, provided to illegal aliens) by 
authorizing a supplemental allotment of federal money to reimburse 
states. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->

The Act also explicitly disqualified payments for 
non-emergency medical care for illegal aliens under the Medicaid program. 
To comply with the rules and obtain federal money, medical 
providers would have had to determine the immigration status of 
patients, which they do not now do.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#17">17</a>  The legislation was vetoed by 
President Clinton.
<P>
<P><B>What is the cost of illegal immigration?</B> Illegal aliens are 
assumed to be a net cost to states. However, while they are 
among the poorest immigrants and pay fewer taxes than legal 
immigrants or the native born, many are employed and do not receive 
services paid for by taxpayers. Thus, figuring the costs that illegal 
immigrants impose on a community, and comparing this with 
benefits to that community from sales tax payments and other 
financial contributions, is no easy task. Illegal immigrants in general 
have more difficulty getting benefits from the welfare system than 
legal residents, and do not identify themselves as illegal if they do. 
As the RAND Corporation has observed, &quot;Congress, state, and 
local policymakers still have no reliable answers to basic 
questions about the costs and benefits of immigration for state and local 
governments, for the economy as a whole, and for the nature 
and speed of integration of new immigrants into U.S. 
society.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#18">18</a>
<P>
<P>A review of the econometric studies of the fiscal burden on 
state and local governments from immigration by the RAND 
Corporation found that &quot;there is general agreement that currently 
illegal immigrants contribute less than those who received amnesty, 
who, in turn, contribute less than legal immigrants, who contribute 
less than the native born. However, this finding merely reflects 
differences in the average incomes of these various groups rather 
than their immigration status per se.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#19">19</a>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->

<P>
<P>In nine different studies<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#20">20</a> examined by the RAND 
Corporation, the available data about the costs of immigration are 
conflicting and inconclusive. &quot;Existing studies of the costs of immigration 
do not provide a reliable or accurate estimate of the net costs and 
benefits of immigration  even wcosts/benefits are defined 
narrowly. Moreover, without reaching consensus on a host of conceptual 
and accounting issues, we doubt that additional studies will shed 
light on these important policy questions.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#21">21</a>  This is because they 
use different definitions for immigrants and public assistance, 
and even count tax revenues differently. Estimates of the per 
capita costs of providing federal, state, and local services to 
immigrants ranged from a low of $2,638 to a high of $4,476. The per 
capita revenue estimates varied from $1,051 to $3,644. When the 
costs and benefits were compared in each study, the conclusions were 
as widely apart as a surplus of $1,400 per immigrant to a net cost 
of $1,600.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#22">22</a>
<P>
<P>RAND's analysis of the six state and local government studies 
of the cost of immigrants found that the methods used to 
calculate costs and benefits tended to include a full list of outlays for 
public services but only a partial list of revenues, including transfer 
payments from higher levels of government. The flawed 
accounting methods showed that neither immigrants nor the native born 
pay their way at the state and local levels. Where estimates were 
made separately for immigrants and the native born, the studies 
found that the &quot;deficit&quot; for immigrants is larger. What the studies 
actually seem to find is only the higher average income, and 
higher taxes paid, by the native born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#23">23</a>
<P>
<P>States and local communities with large immigrant 
populations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->

probably have a disproportionate concentration among them 
of illegal aliens, who tend to be poorest. Mandates for social 
services and welfare, and lax enforcement by social workers of 
rules against aiding illegal aliens, probably impose a financial burden 
on those state and local governments. Because the federal 
government has failed to prevent the illegal immigration, the argument that 
the federal taxpayer should pay any imposed costs is sensible. But 
the size and nature of the costs of illegal immigration have not 
been clearly established. Moreover, the task of identifying the 
immigration status of almost all poor people in America's ethnic 
communities is one that state and local governments may not want to 
undertake.
<P>
<P><B>Are There Too Many Immigrants?</B>
<P>
<P>Many Americans are concerned that the higher rate of 
immigration to the United States in recent years may be too great for the 
cultural assimilation of so many people. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many commentators are concerned that this is 
changing the culture of America. 
<P>
<P>The assimilation of the foreign born could be a problem if 
their numbers were too great. The question is: Are they too great?
<ul><P>
<li><P>In 1993, more than 904,000 legal immigrants and as many 
as 300,000 illegal immigrants settled permanently in the 
United States. The decade 1981-1990 saw 7.4 million legal 
immigrants, which was almost double the 4.5 million who arrived in 
1971-1980. The decade of greatest immigration to the United States 
was 1901-1910, with 8.8 million new arrivals.

<P>
<li>In every decade between the Civil War and the Depression, 
e than 13 percent of the U.S. population; 
today, they are approximately 8 percent. 
</ul>
<P>The principal concern about legal immigration is that the rate 
is increasing every decade, and the current immigration rate plus 
the birth rate among the groups that are arriving in this country 
is higher than the birth rate for other Americans. 
<P>
<P>During the 1980s, immigration contributed 37.1 percent of 
the growth in the U.S. population. In the 1970s, it contributed 
32.6 percent.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#24">24</a>  In 1990, immigrant women aged 35 to 44 had 
given birth to an average of 2.2 children, compared with 1.9 
children among native born women in that age group. The fertility 
concern is amplified by the fact that a greater percentage of 
immigrants than of native-born Americans are of reproductive 
age.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#25">25</a>
<P>
<P>Although the proportion of immigrants in American society 
today is relatively low, and the numbers that come to the United 
States every year are well within historical levels, the demographic 
trend today will produce higher and higher proportions of immigrants 
in the general population. 
<P>
<P>By the year 2050, the proportion of immigrants in the 
general population will rise to approximately the same level as in the 
six decades following the Civil War (over 13 percent). But 
because the population of the United States has increased, and will 
continue to grow, the number of immigrants living in the 
United States by the middle of the next century will be about six 
times greater than in the earlier period.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->

<P>
<P>Another important demographic trend that concerns opponents 
of more immigration is the very significant increase in 
immigration from Asia and Latin America.
<P><ul>
<li><P>In 1981-1990, 37.3 percent of immigrants were from Asia, 
22.6 percent were from Mexico, and 18 percent were from other 
Latin American countries. The great wave of immigration to the 
United States after the Civil War was mostly from Europe and 
essentially Caucasian. But a large proportion of the late 19th century 
immigrants were from the very poor regions of southern and 
eastern Europe and were very different culturally from those who 
originally settled the United States.
<P>
<li>The demographic projection of population growth represented 
by immigrants and the children of immigrants shows that by 
the middle of the next century, Asian or Hispanic immigrants and 
their immediate children will account for roughly a quarter of 
the American population.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#26">26</a>  The population as a whole will 
change from today's proportions of 3 percent Asian, 9 percent 
Hispanic, 11 percent non-Hispanic black, and 77 percent non-Hispanic 
white to approximately 9 percent Asian, 13 percent non-Hispanic 
black, 19 percent Hispanic, and 59 percent non-Hispanic 
white.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#27">27</a>  These estimates do not account for changes that would result from 
intermarriage among members of these groups.
<P></ul>
<P>The concern that opponents of current immigration policy 
feel about too many immigrants in the next century is exacerbated 
by the tendency of immigrants to move into their own ethnically 
homogeneous communities. More than 90 percent of 
immigrants move into cities and live in highly visible ethnic enclaves. 
The increased visibility of Hispanic and Asian communities 
reinforces 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->

the issue, just as the ghettos of Irish and Jewish immigrants in 
the last century and black Americans from the rural South after 
World War I aroused concern. The immigrant population is much 
more concentrated in Southern California, Texas, New York, and 
Miami than in the rest of the country. 
<P>
<P> Just 12 metropolitan areas received 55 percent of new 
immigrants in 1993. One in every three new immigrants now settles in 
California. Of these, 3 in 5 choose to live in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area. Los Angeles is now 40 percent foreign 
born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#28">28</a>
<P>
<P>The question is whether the current U.S. trend is 
toward balkanization or a melting pot. Do large concentrations of 
immigrants living in their own communities, near others with 
similar backgrounds and cultural practices, resist Americanization 
and sustain a separate loyalty to a minority group?  It is easier for 
large ethnic community to use a non-English language outside the 
home, and public schools can be forced to offer bilingual education. 
Assimilation into a more uniform American culture would seem 
less likely to occur, but the evidence actually indicates that urban 
concentrations of immigrants, particularly from countries from 
which large numbers have come, are more likely to become 
naturalized citizens.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#29">29</a>
<P>
<P>For example, in the mid-18th century, Benjamin Franklin 
complained: &quot;Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, 
become a colony of <I>aliens</I>, who will shortly be so numerous as 
to Germanize us instead of Anglifying them, and will never adopt 
our Language or Customs any more than they can acquire our 
complexion.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#30">30</a>  But he was wrong. In New York and Chicago for 
example, the concentrations of Yiddish-speaking immigrants so 
char
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->

acteristic in the earlier period have disappeared.
<P>
<P>Opponents of current U.S. immigration policy maintain that 
assimilation of so many from the last great wave of 
immigration, which ended in the 1920s, was possible because (1) almost all 
immigrants came from Europe, and many from 
English-speaking countries; (2) the influx was stopped for a period of time to 
permit the assimilation of the immigrant minorities into the 
dominant American culture; and (3) the birth rate among the native 
born population was significantly higher than it is today. Only 27.8 
percent of the growth in the U.S. population came from 
immigration during the 1901-1910 peak period, compared with 37.1 percent 
in the 1980s.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#31">31</a>
<P><ul>
<li><P>But the current rate of assimilation is very rapid. Research on 
immigrants to Southern California that looks at the age cohorts 
of recent immigrants has found very rapid increases in English 
language proficiency, naturalization rates, occupational mobility, 
self-employment, and income, in addition to significantly reduced 
poverty rates.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#32">32</a>
<P>
<li>In Southern California, &quot;all immigrant children showed a 
tremendous rate of increase in English ability, though the trend was 
especially marked among Latinos.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#33">33</a>
<P>
<li>By looking at age cohorts of Latino immigrants who arrived 
in California in the 1970s, demographers can see that poverty 
actually declined from 25.7 percent to 15.7 percent as the 
15-to-25-year-old arrivals matured and became 
assimilated.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#34">34</a>
</ul><P>
<P><b>Should population patterns be changed?</b> Author Peter Brimelow, 
in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->

his recent book<I> Alien Nation</I>, points out that the 1965 
immigration law, which opened the doors to higher rates of immigration 
from Asia and Latin America, was passed by Congress with the 
understanding that it would <I>not</I> change America's historical 
population patterns.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#35">35</a>  Since the law has caused such a demographic 
change, however, particularly as the 1986 amnesty for illegal aliens 
has further shifted the family reunification preferences in favor of 
very recent immigrants from Asia and Latin America, he argues that 
the pattern of immigration must be corrected.
<P>
<P>This raises both political and non-political questions about 
what immigration policy the United States should adopt. From a 
political standpoint: 
<ul><P>
<li>The American people as a whole do not get to choose the 
nation's future demographic profile. But on their behalf, Congress does 
set immigration quotas, and these can be written to discriminate 
either for or against people. 
<P>
<li>The federal government has a constitutional responsibility to 
control the national borders, and the requirement that foreigners 
entering the country must have a visa and submit to customs 
inspection is important in maintaining that control. 
<P>
<li>The federal government sets requirements on individuals 
wishing to live permanently in the United States: extensive 
documentation of good character, sponsorship for immigration, and financial 
responsibility. Additional requirements involving financial 
responsibility, English language proficiency, or ethnicity could be 
added by Congress. 

<P>
<li>Both the size of immigration quotas and the categories of 
people who qualify were set in the 1990 Immigration Act and may 
be amended in 1996. But determining whether to increase or 
decrease immigration quotas will have a very small effect on the 
long-term demographic profile of the country.
</ul>
<P>The non-political considerations of immigration policy affect 
the nation's demographic patterns. Within the quota system, 
individual families and employers control the decisions over who 
can immigrate to America by virtue of their power to sponsor 
those individuals. Particular families or employers generally choose 
to sponsor immigrants for very personal or economic reasons, 
and there often is a long waiting period before an immigration visa 
is granted. The question is whether this choice should remain 
essentially personal or should be regarded as a significant public 
interest that requires more political control.
<P>
<P><B>The Immigration Law</B>
<P>
<P>The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes the rules 
and quotas for immigration to the United States.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#36">36</a>  The visas issued 
to immigrants allow them to become permanent residents. The 
law provides that after five years, and after fulfilling a requirement 
to show some knowledge of American history, permanent 
residents may become naturalized citizens of the United States. Prior 
to 1965, specific quotas favoring predominantly European 
countries were enforced. In 1965, Congress repealed this system of 
quotas and established a worldwide quota for immigration, with a 
limit per country. This major change in U.S. immigration law put 
the priority on family unification  individual Americans 
sponsoring relatives to come here.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#37">37</a>  The law fundamentally changed the

phasis from specific nationalities and opened the process 
much more widely to immigrants from Asia. Spouses and most 
children of American citizens are exempt from the quota system, 
while other relatives are given priority over foreigners with no 
American relatives.
<P>
<P>The quota system, with its &quot;preference categories,&quot; is an 
extremely complex area of immigration law. Combined with the limits 
on immigration from individual countries, the preference system 
requires some immigrants to wait many years after applying for 
U.S. permission before receiving it. Immigrants from other 
countries, however, are not subjected to such prolonged delays. The 
quota preference system also includes categories for occupations 
and skills, but these have much smaller quotas and are ranked lower 
in the preference categories.
<P>
<P>The quota system and its preferences were revised by the 
1990 immigration law, but the family unification priority was 
not changed. Current law provides for up to 675,000 immigrants 
annually. Of these, 480,000 (71 percent) are sponsored by relatives 
in the United States, and another 140,000 (21 percent) are 
&quot;economic&quot; immigrants whose acceptance is determined on the 
basis of skills, education, or willingness to invest and create jobs. A 
special preference category was created for &quot;diversity&quot; 
immigration, allowing 55,000, or 8 percent of the total, from countries 
where immigration was lowest in prior years. This provision is 
intended to ease immigration from Ireland and other European countries.
<P>
<P><b>Refugees.</b> The Refugee Act of 1980<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#38">38</a> provides general 
authority for the admission of refugees, who were removed as a 
category under the quota preference system. The number that will come 
to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->

the United States annually is determined by the President in 
consultation with Congress, and there are procedures for 
admitting larger numbers in emergency situations, such as the Haitian 
and Cuban boatlifts. In 1993, 119,482 refugees were admitted.
<P>
<P>Political asylum is granted on a case-by-case basis to aliens 
who meet the definition of refugee but already are in the United 
States or at the border. The requirement for case-by-case 
determinations is a significant administrative burden for the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS). In 1993, there were 150,386 
applications for asylum, and the backlog of cases had reached 
333,000. While waiting for the INS to schedule a hearing for political 
asylum, these individuals generally are allowed free movement 
within the country, and a large number disappear and become 
illegal aliens.
<P>
<P><b>Illegal Immigrants.</b> The Immigration Reform and Control Act 
of 1986 (IRCA)<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#39">39</a> was enacted to control illegal immigration. 
The intent of the law was to focus on the motives of illegal 
immigrants, who come to the United States and get jobs that offer better 
wages and working conditions than they can find in their native 
lands. The principal change in the law prohibiting employment of 
illegal immigrants, however, was to make the employer guilty of 
breaking the immigration law as well. To cut off the job 
opportunities being sought by illegal immigrants, employers were made 
responsible for enforcement. All job applicants must prove their 
citizenship or legal residence to their potential employers by 
completing an INS form (I-9) before they can begin work. The employer 
must verify this information and keep the documents with other 
personnel records. IRCA imposed both civil fines as high as $10,000 
on employers who hire illegal aliens and criminal penalties for a

were living and working in this country, the Congress established 
procedures by which they could apply for legal resident status. By 
1988, more than 3 million people had applied for &quot;legalization&quot; 
under the 1986 law. These legalized immigrants in turn have provided 
a newly enlarged pool of families that are seeking to sponsor 
other relatives for immigration.
<P>
<P><b>Citizenship.</b> A legal permanent resident in the United States 
may apply for citizenship after five years. The Immigration and 
Nationality Act sets out a number of specific requirements for 
becoming a naturalized citizen: a test of the applicant's knowledge of 
U.S. history and the Constitution, proficiency in the English 
language, and an oath renouncing all allegiance to foreign governments 
and swearing loyalty to the United States and a willingness to 
defend it. Congress also could enact additional financial 
responsibility requirements.
<P>
<P><B>The Problem of Illegal Immigration</B>
<P>
<P>There were an estimated 3.2 million illegal aliens in the 
United States as of October 1992, according to the 
INS.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#40">40</a>  The number of illegal residents is estimated to be growing by 300,000 per year.

<P>
<ul>
<li>Fifty-five percent of the illegal immigrants in the United States 

are estimated to be Mexican. Another 22 percent come from 
Central America. 
<P>
<li>Although Mexicans comprise about 90 percent of those 
apprehended at the southern U.S. border, one survey found they 
were joined by representatives of 70 other 
nationalities.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#41">41</a>
</ul><P>In addition to crossing the border illegally, many violators of 
the law just stay in the United States after their non-immigrant 
visas expire. 
<P><UL>
<p><li>In 1993, there were 21 million visas issued to 
non-immigrants, including 17 million tourists and almost 3 million business 
visitors; 165,000 temporary foreign workers and 257,000 foreign 
students also were admitted. In addition, foreign journalists, 
foreign government officials, and the families of persons working for 
international organizations come to the United States freely. 
<P>
<li>During the 1986 fiscal year, the INS apprehended 1.8 million 
illegal entrants. Of these, 243,000 had overstayed their 
visas.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#42">42</a> 
</UL><P>
<P>These statistics do not provide a good picture of the extent of 
the problem, however, because most illegal immigrants who enter 
the United States with a valid tourist or student visa are not 
identified unless stopped by the police for some reason.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a serious problem that law enforcement 
has not been able to control. The shortage of border patrol officers 
and adequate physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border has 
been widely cited as a large factor in the problem, and improved 
enforcement at key locations in California, Texas, Arizona, and 
New Mexico certainly should be undertaken to curb illegal 
crossings. But the larger problem would not be solved by those 
measures alone, because illegal entry is only one source of illegal 
immigration. The problem of individuals misusing tourist visas also 
must be addressed. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->

<P>
<P><B>Identification Cards</B>
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions under IRCA have failed to reduce illegal 
immigration and may have increased racial or ethnic 
discrimination in the workplace.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#43">43</a>  Employers who suspect a job applicant 
may not possess legitimate credentials for legal residence or 
citizenship face a difficult problem. In an effort to solve this problem, 
legislation now before Congress would set up a pilot program 
covering approximately 47 million workers, or almost 40 percent of 
the workforce, to test a computerized national worker 
identification system.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#44">44</a>  In theory, if an employer needed to verify the right of 
a job applicant to work, he could make a telephone call and obtain 
a verification number, just as businesses now do to verify 
credit cards and checks. This would be the employer's defense 
against any subsequent discovery that the new employee was in fact 
an illegal alien.
<P>
<P>Unfortunately, this idea is both impractical and potentially 
dangerous. It would solve a problem caused by less than 1.5 percent 
of the population that is here illegally by dramatically increasing 
government regulation of every American's life. Even the pilot 
program would require over 100 million names and numbers, 
since non-working spouses and children potentially are part of the 
labor force. What ought to be a private contractual arrangement 
between employers and job applicants would become an illegal 
relationship unless the employer first obtained government authorization. 
The danger that such a system would create an underground 
economy with crime and tax evasion is overwhelming. If the 
authorization were denied, for whatever reason  computer data errors, 
bureaucratic mistakes, or even sabotage by a criminal computer hacker 
 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->

the job applicant would be forcibly unemployed. As the 
logical implications of this system of legal sanctions against 
employers become clearer and more threatening to the civil rights of 
ordinary people, public opposition is likely to increase.
<P>
<P>Most advocates of a computer registry admit that it would 
work only with a secure national identification card. Without such 
positive identification, an employer would have no way to 
determine whether the Social Security number being used actually 
belonged to the job applicant. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), sponsor 
of the immigration reform legislation pending in the Senate, has 
described the two functions the worker identification system 
would have: &quot;It must verify that a name corresponds to someone who 
is authorized to work. And then verifying the identity, that the 
person claiming the name and the number is not an impostor. The use of 
a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, is needed if this 
function is to perform reliably.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#45">45</a>
<P>
<P>Before a national computer system to identify every 
American could be installed, there would have to be significant 
improvement in the data stored in the federal government's computers. 
With approximately 6.5 million Americans changing jobs every year, 
an error rate of just one percent would cause 650,000 innocent 
victims to be denied a job until bureaucrats in Washington could 
be persuaded to correct their mistakes. The Social Security 
Administration has estimated that a national computer registry would 
cost between $3 billion and $6 billion  about 10 to 20 times more 
than its advocates have claimed.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#46">46</a>
<P>
<P>The proposal for a national computerized worker registration 
system does not address the basic problem of illegal alien 
employ
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->

ment. Since employers are required to verify the right of job 
applicants to work in the United States today, violations of the law 
may occur because some employers simply ignore it. Advocates of 
the plan are enthusiastic about increasing the number of work site 
inspections for labor law and OSHA violations, along with 
the worker verification. The proposed computer system is an 
expensive, new invasion of every American worker's privacy and 
a threat to law-abiding employers who would have to deal with 
federal inspectors. Employers who violate the law today could 
continue to do so simply by going further underground and 
evading the new computer system.
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions is a misguided concept. The assumption is 
that because an illegal immigrant has broken the law, any 
employer who provides a job is a criminal accomplice. But employers 
are more likely to be the victims of document fraud. A solution to 
the criminal problem of illegal immigration ought to involve less 
government regulation of business, not more. Criminal 
penalties should focus on deterring illegal immigration by punishing 
the criminal, not the rest of the nation.
<a name="RECORD"><P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
<P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has emphasized toughening the 
sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens and increasing the 
number of inspections by the U.S. Department of 
Labor.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#47">47</a>  In addition, INS funding and personnel increased significantly in FY 1995 
and FY 1996: Increases of 26 percent in budget (to $2.6 billion) 
and 3,200 new full-time employees (to approximately 25,000) 
are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

scheduled. This will include an increase of 1,000 Border 
Patrol agents &quot;on the front lines.&quot;  The budget for FY 1995 was 
increased by 25 percent over the prior year, mostly to finance 
improvements in the agency's computer technology. The INS will spend 
more this year on detention and removal of deportable aliens, 
including people who have been denied political asylum. A detention 
facility operated jointly with the U.S. Marshal Service is being built 
in Batavia, N.Y., and a &quot;triple fencing pilot project&quot; is being 
placed on the border south of San Diego.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#48">48</a>
<P>
<P>The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#49">49</a> released its 
interim report to Congress, which addressed illegal immigration, 
in 1994, and a report on legal immigration in 1995. A final 
report covering issues related to immigration will appear in 1997. In 
general, the Commission has supported increased personnel 
and spending to enforce immigration laws at U.S. land borders 
and ports of entry.
<P>
<P>The Commission recommended &quot;development and 
implementation of a simpler, more fraud-resistant system for verifying work 
authorization.&quot;  It endorsed &quot;a computerized registry using data 
provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the INS.&quot; 
 It also called for federal regulation of birth certificates and 
other documents issued by states that establish nationality, as well 
as increased penalties for fraud.
<P>
<P>The Commission supported &quot;in principle&quot; the authorization of 
impact aid to offset the fiscal burdens of unlawful immigration, but 
it wanted further investigation to determine the real costs 
imposed on state and local governments by being required to educate 
illegal immigrant children and provide emergency medical assistance.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->

<P>
<P>The Commission's report on legal immigration generally 
supported changing the family visa priorities and eliminating them 
for adult children and siblings of American citizens. It proposed 
a change in the classifications of labor skills, the elimination of 
Department of Labor certifications, and the establishment of a 
&quot;labor market test&quot; for workers with college degrees. Employers 
would pay a fee to bring in skilled workers, and the money would be 
used for private-sector education and training of American workers.
<P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
<P>
<P>During the 104th Congress, legislation to crack down on 
illegal immigration and further restrict legal immigration moved 
through committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 
At the end of the first session, nothing had been sent to the 
White House. The bills include:
<ul><P>
<li><b>S. 269</b>, the Immigrant Control and Financial Responsibility Act 
of 1995, sponsored by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY).
<P>
<li><b>S. 1394</b>, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995, sponsored by 
Senator Simpson.
<P>
<li><b>S. 1535</b>, the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement 
Act, sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2202</b>, the Immigration in the National Interest Act, 
sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2898</b>, the One Strike and You're Out Illegal 
Immigration 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->

Act, sponsored by Representative Randy Tate (R-WA).
</ul><P>
<P>Although illegal immigration and the legal immigration quota 
system are distinct issues, they have been combined. There is 
widespread agreement on many of the reforms proposed to control 
illegal immigration, but strong differences about the proposals to 
reduce legal immigration quotas.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills increase border enforcement 
patrols and authorize expedited hearings for deportation and 
tougher penalties for document fraud. The legislation begins 
implementation of the national computer identification system to enforce 
employer sanctions. Enforcement powers and penalties are 
increased for smuggling of aliens, as are punishment for repeated 
offenses, detention of illegal immigrants pending removal, and 
criminal penalties for failure to depart.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills contain new restrictions on 
the receipt of public benefits by illegal immigrants and impose 
new requirements for income support on the sponsors of legal 
immigrants. Sponsors will have to demonstrate greater financial 
ability in order to assure that immigrants are less likely to end up on 
welfare. Both the House and Senate bills reduce the number of 
legal immigrants and eliminate whole categories, such as adult 
children, brothers, and sisters. Immigration of parents of U.S. citizens 
would be restricted, and increased financial support requirements 
would be imposed.
<P>
<P>Legislation also has been introduced to make English the 
official language of the federal government. Proficiency in 
understanding simple English is already a requirement for naturalization as a 
U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->

citizen, except for elderly, long-time residents. There is a 
growing concern that the United States in danger of becoming a 
multilingual society, with all the social tensions and political problems 
that have occurred in some other officially multilingual nations. 
Bills include:
<P><ul>
<li><b>S. 356</b>, the Language of Government Act, sponsored by 
Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 739</b>, sponsored by Representative Toby Roth (R-WI), 
and H.R. 1005, sponsored by Representative Peter King 
(R-NY), which provide for English to be the official language of the 
U.S. government and require the INS to apply more strictly the 
English proficiency requirement for naturalization. These bills also 
repeal the Bilingual Education Act. No hearings have been held in 
the House of Representatives.
<P>
</ul>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Separate the specific issue of illegal immigration control from 
the more general issue of immigration quota reform.</b> 
<P>
<P>The legislation pending in Congress should be divided into 
separate bills dealing with each side of the question separately.
<P>
<li><b>Strengthen enforcement measures at the Mexican border and 
other entry points.</b>
<P>
More personnel, physical barriers, and detention facilities 
are needed, as is added enforcement authority to deter the 
smuggling and document fraud involved in illegal immigration. The 
INS 

should increase the scrutiny of applicants for political asylum 
and decide their cases more rapidly. Political asylees should be 
denied work permits until determined to be eligible for legal 
permanent residence. The political debate about immigration policy in 
the United States is inflamed primarily because of the highly 
publicized, inadequate enforcement along the Mexican border. But 
increased border enforcement may only shift the problem to 
other ports of entry. The equally serious problem of illegal 
immigration by aliens who arrive legally as tourists or on business and 
then decide to stay also has to be met with severe penalties. Other 
ports of entry also are heavily burdened by the abuse of political 
asylum by immigrants who have been advised on how to exploit it.
<P>
<li><B>Make illegal immigration a felony. </B>
<P>
<P>There should be brief but mandatory incarceration for the first 
offense after a deportation order has been granted. In addition, 
anyone convicted of illegal immigration should be denied all 
future admission to the United States after deportation, even as a 
tourist or on business. Illegal immigration to the United States is 
attempted because violators see the costs as low and the rewards 
as very attractive.
<P>
<li><B>Repeal employer sanctions. </B>
<P>
<P>Employers should not have to verify the citizenship or 
immigration status of a prospective employee. Instead, criminal 
penalties and deportation, along with an absolute prohibition against 
ever returning to the United States, should be imposed on those 
who break the U.S. immigration laws. The expensive and 
unworkable computer verification system that eventually would require 
all 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->

Americans to carry a national identification card and 
surrender personal privacy should not be started. The enforcement of 
laws against illegal immigration should focus on the law breakers, 
not on the entire American population and millions of innocent 
employers.
<P>
<P>The legitimate concern expressed by many business leaders 
that restrictions on legal immigration will seriously impair their 
ability to hire the people they want and maintain a worldwide labor 
force should be addressed with a uniform system of financial 
reassurance, which also could be used by immigrants who might come 
to the United States to establish new businesses or who seek 
employment without first obtaining a U.S. sponsor. The United 
States does not benefit from numerical quotas for the admission of 
immigrants who would come with the financial assets or skills that 
help guarantee their positive contributions to the national economy, 
to the tax base, and to the middle and upper strata of American 
society. 
<P>
<li><B>Place tough and real financial requirements on 
immigrants and their sponsors to reduce immigrant &quot;gaming&quot; of 
welfare, including a financial bond as security.</B>
<P>
<P>Sponsors of immigrants should be required to demonstrate 
sufficient financial ability to prevent any risk of welfare dependency 
by those who come to the United States. Sponsors' income or 
financial support should be deemed to apply to immigrants' 
income status for the entire term of their legal permanent residence in 
the United States. Posting a bond or purchasing other kinds of 
financial assurance to demonstrate that immigrants will not 
become dependent on welfare, particularly SSI and Medicaid, should 
be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->

made a formal part of the visa approval process. Applicants 
for naturalized citizenship should be required to demonstrate by 
the same means that they will not become dependent on welfare, 
particularly SSI and Medicaid, in future years.
<P>
<P>The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is 
expanding rapidly, and elderly immigrants are a growing proportion of 
the total welfare burden. U.S. immigration policy always has 
included the provision that no one, including the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens should be allowed to become a public charge. The 
obligation of a sponsor to guarantee that an immigrant does not become 
a burden to other American taxpayers should be enforced for as 
long as the immigrant is not an American citizen. The opportunity 
to become an American citizen is a privilege extended to the 
legal permanent resident, but it requires the applicant to undertake 
a significant number of duties and obligations. One of these 
obligations should be to prove financial responsibility. A bond or 
insurance policy or other financial indemnity could eliminate the 
attraction of welfare programs to those who might think about 
immigrating to exploit them; it also could recover part of the costs of 
publicly provided welfare and medical benefits if genuine 
misfortune should befall the new citizen or his family.
<P>
<P>Within the framework set by Congress, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service should be authorized to issue immigration 
visas to any person who meets stringent criteria of good character and 
is able to post a substantial bond or provide other financial 
assurance, subject to forfeiture if any welfare dependency should 
occur. Such a bond or other financial assurance could be remitted if 
the immigrant chose to depart permanently from the United States.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->

<P>
<li><B>Require proficiency in the English language for all 
immigrants and naturalized citizens. </B>
<P>
<P>The standard for naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency 
in English. Immigrants who are not initially proficient in the 
language should be required to practice and study English, and 
their progress should be tested periodically.
<P>
<P>The concept of American nationality is inextricably linked 
with English as the national language. Every other nation in the world 
is identified with its language, and immigration, to say nothing 
of citizenship, often is simply prohibited to outsiders. 
Americans founded a unique republican form of government in the 18th 
century, based on ideal principles of human rights and limited 
government, and invited immigrants to come and join the new civil 
society. But in 200 years, America has become more than simply 
a republic. It has become a people, and English is its language. 
This in no way precludes the right of Americans to converse in 
another language; nor should it discourage the media from providing 
services in another language. But in the courts, the public 
schools, and the political system, the language should be English. 
Becoming proficient in the language of America is a price that any 
immigrant should want to pay.
</ul><P><a name="Q&A">
<P><B>Q&amp;A</B>
<P>
<P><b>Q. What is the difference between legal and illegal 
immigration, and how big a problem is the whole immigration issue?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Legal immigration is a big part of the American tradition, 
and even though there is almost as much legal immigration now 
as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->

there was around the turn of the century, it is only a problem if 
you think there are too many new, legal immigrants. Most legal 
immigrants are family members of American families who want 
to sponsor them and bring them here. Family re-unification is a 
good thing. 
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a crime, and we must increase the 
penalties for committing this crime. No other remedy will work.
<P>
<P>People who come into the United States across the Mexican 
or Canadian border, or who come here as students or tourists and 
stay after their visas expire, are criminals. They should be 
tracked down, arrested, and put in jail for at least a year -- then 
deported. They should be forbidden ever to come back to the United 
States, even as tourists or businessmen. 
<P>
<P><b>Q. With generous welfare benefits in this country and 
poverty throughout the rest of the world, don't immigrants come 
to America primarily to go on the dole?
<P>
<P>A.</b> No. Statistics show that working-age immigrants actually 
use welfare benefits and food stamps less than native born 
Americans of working age. The real problem is the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens, who get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they 
are poor. The laws need to be changed so that if they are sponsored 
to come here by their children, who are U.S. citizens, their 
children will be financially responsible. We have to change the SSI law, 
not the immigration law, to do that.
<P>
<P><b>Q. If legal immigrants to the United States are prevented from 
getting welfare, will they not just take jobs away from native 
born 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->

Americans?
<P>
<P>A.</b> The only immigrant welfare problem is caused by 
elderly people who, after their children bring them to America, then go 
on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they are poor. Their 
children should support them, but they are not going to take any 
jobs away from anyone, because they are already retired.
<P>
<P>Working-age immigrants on average are harder working than 
native born Americans and tend to have a higher labor force 
participation rate than native born Americans.
<P>
<P>Immigrants don't take jobs away from American workers.  In 
addition to the dramatic increase in immigration we have seen in 
the past ten years, we have seen a tremendous increase in new 
jobs and a falling rate of unemployment.
<P>
<P>Everybody who gets a job or keeps a job does so as an 
individual, not as a member of some group. Employers hire individuals 
who can do the work. If an immigrant gets a job, it is because the 
employer has specific job needs that the immigrant is qualified to fill.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would more Border Patrol officers and security fences 
across the Mexican border solve the problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> More Border Patrol officers and security fences are needed, 
and Congress is providing more money to do those things. But 
more than half of the illegal immigration problem comes from 
students and tourist visitors to the United States who simply decide to 
stay after their visas expire, and from people who falsely claim 
political asylum. Border patrols and fences won't keep them out.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->

<P>
<P>The only way to stop illegal immigration is to impose stiffer 
criminal penalties on those who break our immigration laws. We 
need to put them in jail for at least a year after we catch them, and 
deport them after that. And we need to make sure they will 
never again even be able to visit the United States as a tourist or a 
businessman. The word will get out to those violators, and they 
will stop treating the violation of U.S. immigration laws like a game.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would a national identification card, reinforced with a 
government computer system to verify identification, solve the 
problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> A national identification card, with a Big Brother 
computer system in Washington, D.C., would not stop illegal immigrants 
or even stop some employers from hiring them. What it would do 
is deprive all other Americans of some degree of privacy and create 
a monster information database that eventually could be used to 
violate our liberties.
<P>
<P>The law today makes it a crime for employers to hire illegal 
immigrants, but employers are victims, not criminals. We 
shouldn't create a system that punishes the victims and every other 
innocent American worker. Advocates of the giant computer system 
really are trying to increase government regulations on employers 
and create a justification for an army of Labor Department 
inspectors to invade every workplace in America.
<P>
<P><b>Q. How much should the federal government pay to states that 
are forced to carry the costs of illegal immigration?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->

<P>
<P>A.</b> The federal government should be prepared to pay the 
entire costs of illegal immigration. Enforcing the immigration laws is 
a federal responsibility. If the federal government cannot do its 
job, it should pay the costs. The Balanced Budget Act Congress 
passed last year set up a way to pay the states for emergency 
medical treatment for illegal aliens.
<P>
<P>At the same time, the states should have to demonstrate the 
actual costs of illegal immigration. There have been a number of 
so-called studies of the costs of immigration, but none of them 
really proves that there is a significant cost or measures how great it 
may be. We need to get the real data and figure out how much the 
costs are; then the federal government should pay for the problem.
<P>
<P>But the most important things the federal government can do 
to stop illegal immigration are to hire more Border Patrol officers 
and stiffen the criminal penalties for breaking our immigration laws.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Should English be established officially as America's 
language and immigrants be required to read, write, and speak English?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Yes. Proficiency in the English language should be required 
of all immigrants and naturalized citizens. The standard for 
naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency in English. 
Immigrants not initially proficient in the language should be required to 
practice and study English, and their progress should be tested 
periodically.
<P>
<P>English as the national language is central to the concept 
of American nationality. Every other nation in the world is 
closely identified with its language. English is America's language.

</P>
<P>The 104th Congress has taken dramatic first steps to reform  itself. But
although the new majority  particularly the newly  elected freshmen  has made
great strides in achieving the  meaningful reform that the voters demanded
through the 1994  congressional election, much remains to be done. Congress now
must  complete the task of reforming its own operations and extend the process 
of reform to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress and the President must work together to complete  these reforms
both to demonstrate their commitment to the  American people and to make
government more accountable to the  voters and less focused on protecting
special interests and the careers  of politicians.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress made great strides in the effort to clean  up Washington,
enacting substantial reforms in its own processes  that changed the &quot;business-as-usual&quot;
mentality which frustrated  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  sponsible government before the
1994 elections. But full  reform obviously takes time. The fact is that the new
Congress inherited  a federal government beset with fundamental problems in all 
three branches  executive, legislative, and judicial.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To complete the reforms begun in 1995, therefore, Congress  and the
President must confront a series of problems, some old and some new.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      The Supreme Court ruled state-imposed term limits 
unconstitutional.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#2">2</A>
the U.S. Supreme Court  held that states may not impose term limits on their own
Members  of Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress 
itself may not  by statute  impose term limits. The impact of  this decision was
to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and  give greater force to the idea
of a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ensure that members of the House and Senate  stay in touch
with their constituents and truly represent their views is  to prevent
politicians from spending their entire careers in  Washington. If they knew that
Congress could not be a career,  legislators would be less interested in the
trappings of office and less  inclined to feather their own nests, mislead the
voters, legislate  irresponsibly, and abuse their offices as part of their
reelection efforts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are at least four key arguments for a constitutional  amendment to
limit congressional terms:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Term limits are popular.</B> Support for limiting 
congressional 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  terms reaches as high as 80
percent in some polls. The Gallup  poll shows that a 49 percent plurality of
Americans favored term  limits for Congress in 1964, with support swelling to 64
percent in  1990 and 73 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Term limits receive substantial support at the polls.</B> In 
addition to the fact that term limits were one of the most popular  components
of the Contract With America, voters have supported  them overwhelmingly when
faced with ballot initiatives. In the 22  states with term limits by referendum,
the average level of support in  the voting booth on election day was 66
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Term limits are a fundamentally democratic concept.</B> Since  as far
back as Aristotle, the concept of limiting the tenure of  politicians has been a
topic of public debate. One of America's  own Founding Fathers, James Madison,
argued 200 years ago that  term limits would reduce the influence of special
interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Term limits ensure healthy change.</B> Increasing the turnover  in
Congress gives more citizens the opportunity to serve their  government and
their fellow Americans. The introduction of fresh  insights into the political
process increases the chances that  dramatic improvements in the role of
government can be effected.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>23 STATES HAVE IMPOSED TERM LIMITS ON THEIR STATE LEGISLATORS</B>

Arkansas, Maine, Nevada, Utah, California,  Massachusetts, North Dakota,
Washington, Colorado, Michigan,  Ohio, Wyoming, Florida, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Audits have uncovered significant past abuses.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>On January 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 430-1 
for an internal audit by an outside accounting firm, Price  Waterhouse. It was a
matter of bipartisan conventional wisdom that the  management of the House had
been permeated with &quot;abuses and  management inefficiencies,&quot; in the
words of former House  Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-MO) in 1992.
Although a  few House accounts had been audited by the General Accounting 
Office, it is likely that many had never been reviewed by an  independent
examiner. Since one such audit uncovered the House  Bank scandal, a full
accounting was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The accounting practices of the 103rd Congress revealed by  the Price
Waterhouse audit demonstrate that the House's financial  and operational
controls were worse than even the harshest critics  had imagined. The 14
material weaknesses uncovered would be  troubling in a medium-sized business;
their presence in the  13,000-employee House of Representatives is a national
disgrace.  Most disturbing are the conclusions that the House was:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Wasting</B> millions of dollars on inefficient
purchasing practices  and superfluous staff; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Failing</B> to prevent employee fraud through multiple 
reimbursements for the same purchase; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Allowing</B> the use of official resources for campaign purposes;
and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Keeping</B> such careless records that the magnitude of the loss
to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  public probably will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The good news is that the new Congress, under the leadership  of Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), House Oversight  Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA),
Representative Jim Nussle  (R-IA), its administrative officers, and the
management team they  brought in, has taken aggressive action to correct the
deficiencies  identified by the audit. Many of the 226 recommendations the
auditors  made already have been implemented, and the remainder are  being
implemented.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Members of Congress still benefit from a system of perks  and
privileges.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Excessive pay, perks, and expenses focused citizen anger on  Congress and
helped trigger the 1994 electoral revolution. The  new Republican majorities in
the House and Senate moved quickly  to cut staff and expenses and to eliminate
many of Congress's  exemptions from the law. Further steps are necessary,
however,  to reduce perks, reform pensions, and further trim staff. 
Congressional committees currently are considering some of these  reforms, while
others will likely be debated in the course of the  appropriations process. But
problems remain, such as automatic pay  raises, excessive pensions, and high
expense accounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These perks continue to insulate Congress from American  citizens, to
frustrate political fairness, and to promote legislative  careerism and
bureaucracy. Reforms in these areas will mean a more  efficient, representative,
and politically competitive Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Automatic Pay Hikes.</B>  These pay hikes are
scheduled each  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  with no vote required, further
boosting lawmakers' salaries,  which already exceed $11,000 a month ($133,600
per year).  Because Members' salaries are funded by a permanent, indefinite 
appropriation rather than through the annual appropriations bill, they  are
nearly invulnerable to legislative change when the rest  of Congress's budget is
under discussion. Congress should  make Members' salaries a legislative
appropriations line item and  eliminate the automatic salary cost-of-living
adjustments (COLAs)  that, unless Congress acts, give each Member an automatic
pay  hike. Such an automatic pay raise violates the spirit of the 27th 
Amendment to the Constitution, which states that Members must stand  for
reelection before any pay raise they vote on takes effect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excessive Pensions.</B> Congressional pensions far exceed most 
private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as  generous as
those of most Fortune 500 corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers,  but they also
promote political careerism by providing incentives  for lawmakers to extend
their tenure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over 250 Members of the 103rd Congress will become  &quot;pension
millionaires,&quot; receiving pension income after their retirement  in excess
of $1 million. For instance, former Speaker of the  House Tom Foley (D-WA) is
eligible for nearly $124,000 per year in  addition to the pay he will receive
from his job at a  lobbying/law firm. The former Speaker could take in over $3
million in  pension checks over the course of his expected lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>COLAs are applied to congressional pensions as well as  congressional
salaries. Only one in ten private-sector pensions is  adjusted 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  for inflation, and many of those
compensate for as little as a  third of the inflation rate. This feature makes
former Members of  Congress among the wealthiest of retired Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members' office expense accounts are too high.</B> The 1996 
appropriation combined the three House Members' personal  allowance accounts
(staff salaries, office expenses, and official mail) into  one appropriation, a
positive step to increase flexibility and ease  administrative burdens. However,
the combined account was  increased by over 2 percent, to over $360 million, due
to increases  in staff salaries and mail funding. A House committee has 
approved an additional 2 percent increase for the coming year, to an  average of
$887,337 for each House member. Although increases in  postal rates and
population may justify some adjustment of mail  allowances, it is difficult to
make similar arguments for an increase  in the aggregate staff salary
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the debate at the beginning of the 104th Congress over  the proposed
elimination of House Legislative Service  Organizations, advocates of abolition
intimated that a substantial portion of the  $5 million spent each year on LSOs
would be saved. In fact,  these funds were not cut, and even steeper staff cuts
are justified. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Incumbents retain a significant electoral advantage.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Campaign finance law and congressional perquisites provide  huge electoral
advantages for incumbents, leading to House  reelection rates of well over 90
percent  even the dramatic 1994  elections produced a reelection rate of 90.2
percent. This remarkable  level of job security is the result of several
built-in advantages that  stack the election deck. There are several reasons why
incumbents  enjoy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  such success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Challengers have difficulty raising funds.</B> After
passage of  the 1974 law that first regulated contributions to congressional 
campaigns, incumbents' financial advantage over challengers  grew fivefold by
1992, approaching an advantage of four to one.  In 1994, this had fallen
somewhat, to just over two to one. Much  of this is due to political action
committee (PAC) donations   special-interest gifts five times larger than
individuals are allowed  to contribute   that flow to incumbents by a
disproportionate  margin of nine to one.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members use constituent services to build a voter base.</B> The 
greatest tax-funded advantage enjoyed by incumbents is the  routine operation of
congressional offices. Members of Congress  use about half their staffs for
constituent service or casework,  helping voters who have problems with the
government. The irony is  that these problems flow in large part from the very
laws and  government programs Congress makes possible. Says former  Minnesota
Representative Vin Weber, &quot;we create the government that  screws you, and
then you're supposed to thank us for protecting you  from it.&quot;  Studies
show that constituent service adds 5 percent to 10  percent to a typical
Member's vote total.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#3">3</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members have free mailing privileges  though now in  smaller
amounts.</B> In March 1994, the House Oversight Committee  approved a one-third
cut in Members' franking allowances from  their 1994 authorizations. This will
save over $20 million in  postage-related spending yearly, bringing down the
average annual  spending ceiling per congressional office from $163,000 to 
$108,000. This is a healthy step on the road to eliminating abuses that  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  petuate congressional careerism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Many campaign finance &quot;reform&quot; schemes are overregulatory.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of the reform plans to diminish the influence of money  in politics
create a regulatory system that actually protects  incumbents and punishes
challengers. The key elements of many  regulatory campaign finance reform plans
include spending limits,  advertising subsidies, and public financing. These
provisions  are likely to make elections even less competitive and less 
issue-oriented.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four key problems involved in limiting  congressional campaign
spending:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Spending limits uniformly punish challengers.</B>
Studies  have demonstrated that challengers need to spend significant amounts 
of money to unseat sitting Members of Congress. In 1994, the  average challenger
who unseated an incumbent spent well  over $700,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Spending limits ignore the advantages of incumbency.</B> In  addition
to contending with incumbents' natural advantage in  name identification and
media access, challengers must compete  with the enormous array of
taxpayer-funded resources that  incumbents have at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Spending limits violate the First Amendment.</B> Mandatory  limits
are clearly unconstitutional. To get around this problem, most  proposals call
the limits voluntary, but they place those who do  not accept the caps at such a
great disadvantage that the limits  argu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  ably are made compulsory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Spending limits encourage evasion, hiding, and cheating.</B> 
Citizens will always find ways to express their views. The  principal effect of
government regulation of political speech is to push  citizens away from
straightforward activities (such as direct  donations) into more circuitous
methods. Previous attempts at  regulating away political influence have led to
the development of  PACs, bundling, soft money, and independent expenditure 
campaigns.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#4">4</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Public Financing Is No Answer.</B> Another way to limit  the
influence of money on politics is through public subsidizing  of campaigns.
Already, presidential campaigns receive a limited  public subsidy that has
become increasingly unpopular with  the American taxpayers (as demonstrated by
the declining number  of taxpayers who elect to participate on their tax forms).
The  four most critical problems with public financing are:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The money is already committed.</B> Public financing of 
congressional candidates would require additional funds from the  federal budget
 an effort which the commitment to a balanced budget  by 2002 makes all the more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Public financing is expensive.</B> Taxpayer grants for  congressional
candidates could well total in the hundreds of millions of  dollars. The
possibility of nearly 1,000 subsidized candidates every  two years vividly
demonstrates the tremendous cost of  government involvement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. The people oppose public financing.</B> Taxpayers have  abandoned the
presidential campaign fund checkoff, with participation  falling 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  from 29 percent in 1980 to 17
percent in 1991. To find  sufficient funds for the 1996 presidential elections,
Congress was forced  to raise the value of the individual checkoff from $1 to $3
per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Subsidizing political extremists is unattractive to most  Americans.</B>
Experience with the presidential fund shows that fringe  candidates are
attracted by government subsidies. Third-party  radical Lenora Fulani received
nearly $1 million in federal  matching funds in the 1988 presidential campaign
and over $2 million  in 1992.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#5">5</A> 
Because there cannot be an ideological litmus test for  public financing, tax
dollars inevitably would go to dozens of  extremist candidates ranging from
Fulani to Lyndon La Rouche to  David Duke.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Broadcast Subsidies Also Are No Answer.</B> Postal and  broadcast
subsidies are nothing more than public funding in disguise.  By compelling
broadcasters or the postal service to provide no-cost  or low-cost political
communication services to candidates, the  government essentially is taxing
these entities and transferring  those funds to the candidates. All of the
problems that exist with  public subsidies necessarily carry over to this
heavy-handed,  big-government &quot;reform&quot; scheme.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Taxpayer-subsidized lobbying helps drive up the cost of 
government.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently subsidizes lobbying by  tax-exempt
organizations by supplying grants and contracts to  advocacy groups. Each year,
America's taxpayers provide these  organizations with billions of dollars which
they then use to advance  their own political agendas.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by  ideology.
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use  taxpayers'
funds to promote their ideas and positions. Almost  every interest in America 
from agriculture to zoology  has one  or more organizations tainted by
government funding. The  American Association of Retired Persons, for example,
received over  $73 million in a one-year period, while the American Bar 
Association received over $2 million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 40 years, Congress has created a vast patronage  network of
organizations that enjoy preferred tax status, receive  federal funds, and
engage in legislative or political advocacy.  The days of big-city political
machines disbursing patronage may  be coming to an end, but the disbursement of
financial dividends  to political friends remains a prominent feature of the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo wrote in their  1985 book <I>Destroying
Democracy</I>: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      A large number of individuals with strong views can 
express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that  promotes that
issue. With tax-funded politics, however, a  small number of zealots with access
to the public purse can  obtain resources to advance its views even though few
individuals  in society share the group's philosophy. Whenever  government funds
any political advocacy group, it effectively  penalizes those groups that
advocate opposing public policies and  provides a distinct advantage to the
group or groups it favors  in the clash of ideas.<A

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 --> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Congress began to address the significant problem of  welfare for
lobbyists. In the House, Representatives Ernest Istook  (R-OK), David McIntosh
(R-IN), and Robert Ehrlich (R-MD)  proposed an amendment to an appropriations
bill that would limit  the amount of money federal grantees could spend on
political  advocacy to not more than 5 percent of their non-grant  revenue.<A
HREF="ftnt12.htm#7">7</A>  Even though this formula permitted
charities to spend generous  amounts of money on lobbying, it was bitterly
opposed. The  amendment died in conference.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Huge Growth in Committees and Staff
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Until action was taken in the 104th Congress, the explosion  in committees
and staff led to the growth of a powerful staff  bureaucracy and made it easier
for interest groups to influence  legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     House committee staff had grown almost twelvefold since 
World War II. In the last two decades alone, committee staffs in  the House of
Representatives had grown by 158 percent. Congress  was the most heavily staffed
legislature in the world by a factor of  five, with nearly 40,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The number of committees and subcommittees totaled under  200 in 1947,
exploded in the post-Watergate era, and did not fall  significantly under 300
until the early 1990s. The new Congress  cut this number to 198.

</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and  practices. The
1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress  and delivered a clear
reform mandate. The Contract With  America promised numerous changes in House
rules, and the new  leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate
and  ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th  Congress,
the House voted to end procedures that had become  increasingly arbitrary and
secretive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of  the institution's
critics. The rules were designed to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Improve deliberation</B> by banning proxy (absentee) voting in 
committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process,  and requiring
fuller reporting on spending bills.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Streamline the legislative process</B> by cutting the number of 
committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of  legislation, and
slashing committee staff.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Promote accountability</B> by requiring that committee meetings 
be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll  call votes on
major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate  transcripts, and
conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Increase responsiveness</B> by imposing term limits on the 
Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a  measure to
apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative  vote 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  in the 104th Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight  specific
first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</B> The new rules  package
eliminated three House committees  Post Office and Civil  Service, District of
Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries   and 25 subcommittees. The
committee reform provision also  will shrink House committee staff by one-third.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> 2)  Truth in Budgeting.</B> Appropriations committees are now  required
to compare new spending recommendations to the  current spending level. Under
the old system, tax-and-spend liberals  had the upper hand because spending
increases were judged not  against what was actually spent last year, but
against projected  spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending
increase could  be called a &quot;cut.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</B>  House
committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more  than three consecutive
Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure  of committee chairmen begins to
address some of the concerns  of advocates of full-scale legislative term
limits. A central problem  of previous Congresses had been that committee
chairmen, who  set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd
Congress,  for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most  powerful
committees (Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce)  had held these positions
for over a decade; the chairman of the  third (Appropriations) had just vacated
his position after holding it  since the 1970s.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more  than four
Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional  officer of the
legislative branch in line with the President, his  executive branch
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Elimination of Proxy Voting.</B> Elimination of the practice  of
allowing absent members of a committee to loan their votes  to other members was
critical to ensuring fairness and  improving committee deliberation. Although
House rules strictly  prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on
the House  floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by this rule's 
violation), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the  103rd Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, proxy voting allowed the majority party leadership  to extend
its control over committee outcomes by scheduling  multiple, contemporaneous
committee and subcommittee  meetings. Proxy voting also promoted committee
absenteeism by  ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain
their ability  to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to
 abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against 
legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its  merits.
Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee  chairmen and force
Members to show up and actually participate in  the work of their committees if
they want their votes to count.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5)  Open Meetings.</B> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public  access
to committee meetings. In previous Congresses,  committees frequently closed
their doors to the press and public, a step  the panels could take for nearly
any reason. In fact, the two  House 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  committees that most often
operated in secret   Appropriations and Ways and Means  were the ones making 
controversial choices about federal taxation and spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open  hearing or meeting
(previously, media coverage was subject to a vote  of approval). The new rules
also require that committees publish  recorded committee votes in their reports
(most voting records  previously were available only at committee offices) and
that  hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor  grammatical
changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6)  Tax Hikes More Difficult.</B> The new rules require a  three-fifths
vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and  prohibit retroactive
taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been  particularly controversial,
with some Washington  commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or
even  unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the
conviction  that new tax increases are needed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions  voters have
imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the  most beneficial aspects of
the 60 percent tax rule is that any future  Congress desiring to raise taxes
would have to alter or waive the  rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost.
The provision also  balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively
requires a  60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions 
are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>7)  Authorization of House Audit.</B> Another 1995 rules change 
authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and  fa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  cilities by an independent
accounting firm. Some House  accounts previously had been audited sporadically
by the General  Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the
fact  that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most  House accounts
were not examined regularly, and some may never  have been reviewed by an
independent examiner. This audit was  the first complete accounting of the
House's financial status  ever made available to the public.<A
HREF="ftnt12.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>8)  Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</B> The last of the  Contract
reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA).  This measure has both
substantive and symbolic importance. It  underscores the principle that no
American should be immune from  the law or receive special treatment in its
application. The bill  also should encourage legislators to review the burdens
that  federal laws place upon American citizens and ensure that the  benefits
they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Term Limits </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress also held the first-ever votes on term  limits. Although
the House fell short of the necessary two-thirds  majority by 63 votes (227
ayes, 204 nays), the vote marked a  significant improvement over previous
Congresses that refused even to  debate the issue. Seven months after the House
vote, the Senate took up  a nonbinding resolution supporting term limits. The
resolution  failed to win majority support (45 ayes, 49 nays). Still, by putting
 members of the House and Senate on record as publicly supporting  or opposing
term limits, supporters now have a standard  against which they can measure
future Congresses. In addition, the  voters will know  unequivocally  where
their representatives stand  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  this important issue. A Senate
vote on a constitutional  amendment is planned for early 1996, though supporters
concede they are  certain to fail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Budget Cuts </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY  1996 legislative
branch appropriations bill provided systemic  congressional reforms as important
as any yet enacted, including  spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and
abolition of unnecessary  offices and functions. The FY 1996 congressional
budget would  reduce spending in real dollars  not phony &quot;baseline&quot;
cuts  by  $242 million, or 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the  government by
slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded  agencies, including the $21 million
Office of Technology  Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the
national  legislature. The reforms push the General Accounting Office to
privatize  its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and 
library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract  out some of its
auditing work so that it can benefit from the  lower costs available in the
private sector. The result is a real cut of  more than one-fourth in the GAO's
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite Congress's effort to lead by example by cutting its  own budget
first, President Clinton vetoed the legislative branch  appropriations bill the
first time it reached his desk. He stated that  he liked the bill but did not
want to let Congress receive its  funding early in the budget process. In other
words, the President  decided that scoring political points was more important
than  achieving 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  real spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting  the types and
amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The  Senate passed a complex rule that
allowed single gifts up to $50, with  a $100 annual limit. Any item less than
$10 fell outside the  Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping
proposal  offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich to prohibit all gifts. Both the 
Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for  commemorative items and
expenses related to official activities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the  House and Senate
in late 1995. While this legislation would adopt  new reporting requirements and
close loopholes in the original  1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many
potential pitfalls.  It successfully protects legitimate grassroots organizing,
as well  as part-time and small lobbying operations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A glaring omission from the so-called reform bill was any  meaningful effort
to address taxpayer-subsidized lobbying.  Opponents of this reform argued for
months that welfare for lobbyists  should be addressed in the lobby reform
debate, then turned around  and argued against any House amendments to this
important  legislation. The result is a flawed lobby reform bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a very poor record on  political reform
issues. The President has supported an overregulatory  cam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  paign finance &quot;reform&quot;
scheme that would impose spending  limits and public financing. He promoted
lobbying reform but  adamantly opposed provisions that would have restricted the
abuse of  taxpayer grants through government-subsidized lobbying.  Moreover, he
has not supported the most important reform needed to shake  up the current
political process: term limits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has promoted the concept of  &quot;reinventing
government,&quot; but a close examination of the fine print  of the
Administration's plan shows that it makes federal  management even worse.
Clinton proposals weaken merit standards in  hiring, promotion, and pay and
strengthen the role of federal unions  in setting salary levels of work
assignments in federal agencies,  thus directly undermining management
authority. The result: a  federal bureaucracy even less accountable to the
public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress achieved dramatic reforms in the structure  and operation
of Congress, but many other reforms are needed.  Among them, the new Congress
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Pass a constitutional amendment for term limits.</B> Although  the
104th Congress put all its members on record for or against  term limits, the
failure to enact the reform means that Members of  Congress still can remain in
office as long as they want. The  Supreme Court's ruling against state-based
term limits leaves Congress  no choice but to enact a constitutional amendment
to end  congressional careerism.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Slash congressional perks and privileges. </B>Congress should  end

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  wasteful, inefficient spending
and perquisites that separate  lawmakers from their constituents. The reforms in
the Contract  With America were good first steps, but Congress should continue 
to reform its own pay, pensions, perks, and staff. Specifically,  it should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Eliminate</B> the automatic pay raise mechanism currently
in effect;

<P>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Citizen Congress Act, introduced in the House by  Representatives Mark
Sanford (R-SC) and Wayne Allard (R-CO) and in  the Senate by Bill Frist (R-TN),
is a sensible effort to address  these perks and privileges, including the items
listed above. The  bill (H.R. 2610/S. 1405) also would eliminate mass mailings
paid  for by the taxpayers  a tremendous incumbent advantage. These  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  forms are needed to bring
Congress more in contact with the  challenges faced by average citizens and to
help restore  Americans' trust in government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Action on the political reform that the American public has  demanded is
beginning to materialize, as shown by the 23 states  that passed term limits
legislation and by the provisions of the  Contract With America providing for
congressional committee and  staff reductions. To make challengers more
competitive and ensure  that incumbents are not abusing taxpayers' funds in
their  re-election campaigns, Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Curtail franked mass mailings</B> from House Members
through a  75 percent cut in the franking allowance;

television recording studios and calendars mailed out at taxpayers'  expense,

either through simple prohibition of the practice or tighter  regulation of
official travel; and

<P>
</P>
<P><B>-      Cut clerk-hire budgets by 10 percent,</B> using some of the
savings  to create a central constituent service office to handle routine 
requests. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Eliminating these advantages, in addition to saving  taxpayers money, would
represent true campaign finance reform by  diminishing the overwhelming
advantages incumbents enjoy in  elections. Reformers who seek genuinely
competitive elections and  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  more efficient, representative,
and deliberative Congress  should place cuts in congressional pay, perks,
pensions, and staff at  the top of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Enact campaign finance reform.</B> While the most important 
steps toward improving the American electoral system are term  limits and
reducing the incumbency advantage, other improvements  can be made in campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Wamp Congress Act of 1995 (H.R. 2148), named for  sponsor Zach Wamp
(R-TN), provides productive and realistic reforms  that reduce special-interest
and incumbent advantages with a  minimum of new regulation. The legislation
would:

be from the candidate's home state.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<P>Wamp points out that the proposed increase in individual  donation limits is
less than the level required to offset inflation since  1974. His proposal

<P><B>*     Apply the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.</B> The  major
flaw in the Congressional Accountability Act was its exclusion  of the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) from the list of  covered laws. The FOIA does not
apply to the private sector because it  is intended to give the public access to
government information.  Excluding the Act makes it appear that Congress thinks
it has  something to hide and runs counter to the openness in government 
principles embodied in most other House reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End welfare for lobbyists.</B> Although Congress has begun to 
address the issue of taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy, much  remains to be
done. In the 105th Congress, investigative hearings  must continue to examine
existing abuses, and further remedies must  be considered. The information
gained from these hearings and  from further investigation into the activities
of federal grantees must  be used to develop a meaningful reform proposal that,
as nearly  as possible, eliminates this outrageous abuse of taxpayers' funds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At its root, the issue of welfare for lobbyists is one of fairness  and
fiscal responsibility. True reform can be achieved only if it  includes the
following principles:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Full Disclosure.</B> Strong reporting requirements
are necessary  to shed light on the extent of this problem. Widespread abuse is 
already apparent  even from the limited and often confusing  data currently
gathered by the government. Federal grantees must  be tracked carefully and
should be required to indicate how  much money they dedicate to advocacy.
Furthermore, whatever  informa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  tion the government collects
should be readily available to  the public for inspection. To the greatest
extent feasible, this  should include availability via the Internet at no cost
to users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Truth in Testimony.</B> Witnesses testifying before Congress 
should be required to divulge whether they receive federal funds and,  if so,
for what purposes and in what amounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</B> No advocacy organization 
that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in  anything but
incidental lobbying except on issues related directly to its  tax status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</B> No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to provide financial assistance  to any
affiliated organization that engages in lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees
should be treated as if they received the funds  directly from the federal
government. Organizations should not  be able to create sham &quot;foundations&quot;
that launder taxpayer funding  to support lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Tough Penalties.</B> The consequences for violating the
prohibition  on federally subsidized lobbying must be firm enough to  discourage
organizations from violating the standards. Under no  circumstances should any
organization that willingly and knowingly  violates this prohibition receive
additional federal funding.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Civil Service Reform. </B>The new Congress and the new  President must
cooperate in tackling the toughest management chore in  the country: running the
federal bureaucracy. To do this, they  must examine every agency and bureau of
the government to:

altogether.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While reforming federal hiring, pay, and benefit policies, both  the
President and Congress must be sure to enforce the merit  principles of the
civil service system and maintain a bright line  between career and non-career
jobs. The usurpation of policy  functions by career staff undermines the
accountability of political  appointees to the President and the taxpayer, while
political abuse  of career staff undermines the integrity and professionalism of
 the civil service. Under no circumstance should Congress  undermine the
President's authority to appoint his own people to positions  of responsibility
and thus carry out his agenda and fulfill his  promises to the taxpayers. Good
government is accountable government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the meantime, the President and Congress should advance  serious reform
of the federal civil service system:

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Establish serious pay-for-performance standards for

throughout the federal workforce.

adopt a defined contribution for federal retirement and expand  investment

President and Congress should consolidate the Office of  Management and Budget
(OMB), the Office of Personnel  management (OPM), and the General Services
Administration (GSA) into a  new Office of Management. At the same time, federal
employee  appeals and grievances, now scattered among EEOC, the  Federal Labor
Relations Board (FLRB), and the Merit Systems  Protection Board (MSPB), should
be consolidated into one agency.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't the Republicans hypocritical to attack  congressional
careerism in 1994, then fail to pass term limits in 1995?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The 104th Congress made great progress on term limits just  by
bringing the measure up for a vote in the House and Senate.  Although both
houses failed to come up with the two-thirds  majority needed to move the
amendment forward, they have provided  term limit supporters with a solid
benchmark to use in pressing ahead  in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will likely take at least one more election before Congress  has enough
conservative members dedicated to the cause of term  limits to muster the
supermajority needed to press ahead with a  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  stitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't Congress really just trying to &quot;muzzle&quot; opponents
with  its effort to end welfare for lobbyists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. The attempts to end taxpayer-subsidized lobbying all  seek to
end 40 years of corrupt political patronage. The proposals  considered by the
104th Congress applied to groups all across  the ideological spectrum. Despite
cries that the reform  efforts amounted to nothing more than &quot;defunding the
left,&quot; the  Simpson-Istook compromise language that reached the floor of
the  House and Senate would affect corporations that receive grants  (primarily
for research and development) just as much as nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare for lobbyists is a fundamental question of fiscal  responsibility.
With the drive to achieve a balanced budget in 2002, it  is utterly
irresponsible for the government to be feeding hungry  lobbyists instead of
hungry children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are some of the most vocal supporters of term limits  career
politicians?  Why don't they apply term limits to themselves?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some Members, particularly those elected since 1990,  have agreed
to self-imposed term limits. This marks significant  progress toward a true &quot;citizen
Congress.&quot;  However, many Members  are reluctant to agree voluntarily to
term limits. If reformers  unilaterally &quot;disarm themselves&quot; by leaving
Congress now, the  career politicians left behind will enjoy an even tighter
control of  Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can the influence of big money contributions be reduced?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to reduce the impact of special interests on 
elections is to reduce the role of Washington. This can be  accomplished in
several ways. First, reducing the size of  government would reduce the number of
programs subject to  special-interest lobbying and would lower the taxes from
which corporations  routinely seek exceptions. Similarly, imposition of a flat
tax  would eliminate the bidding for tax code loopholes that currently  drives
much Washington lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second step is to reduce Washington's role in the  political process.
Ending taxpayer-subsidized lobbying and forcing  special interests to raise
their money directly from supporters will place  all groups on a level playing
field. At the same time, the federal  government should remain out of the
business of overregulating  elections. In fact, current regulatory schemes are
part of the problem.  It is important to recall that the 1970s campaign finance
reform  effort produced PACs, now the target of reform themselves.  Elections
should not be government-funded, the media should not  be forced to carry
no-cost or low-cost political advertising, and  the government should not impose
spending limits. Moreover,  individual and PAC contribution levels should be
equalized to  ensure that special interests do not enjoy an advantage over 
individual voters.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, the ultimate solution to the influence of money in  politics is
to adopt term limits. Limiting the tenure of Members  of Congress forces them to
focus more on policies than politics.  With the understanding that they will not
be part of a &quot;career  Congress,&quot; Members will not be as dependent on
special interests to remain  in office.

<P>
</P>
<P>Race and all of the complex and emotional issues that flow from  it have
been America's unique dilemma since before the founding  of the Republic. After
centuries of overt discrimination against  black Americans, the Supreme Court,
in a series of seminal  decisions beginning with <I>Brown v. Board of 
Education</I> in 1954, initiated the long process of dismantling the
institutional sources of racial  discrimination in American society in areas
such as education,  housing, and voting. Congress, too, attempted to remove
these  barriers in historic legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
 the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Rise of Affirmative Action. </B>Over the last three  decades,
however, federal judges and agency bureaucrats have  embarked upon a sustained
crusade to twist and distort the original intent  of these laws so that race,
ethnicity, and sex became the proxy  for special, rather than equal, treatment
under the law. Race  consciousness quickly overtook color blindness as the
guiding  principle for the application of civil rights laws that Congress 
explicitly intended to be neutral on these grounds. Today, liberals  justify
race and sex preferences  which have proliferated under the  guise of
affirmative action  as an appropriate and long-overdue  response to centuries of
discrimination against racial minorities  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  women.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, federal agencies now administer literally hundreds  of programs
that favor individuals, businesses, and other  institutions on the basis of the
race, ethnicity, or sex of those who benefit  from these programs. These
preferences can be found in federal  statutes, regulations, and executive
orders. Some are specific to a  particular law or agency; others are
government-wide in their application.  A thorough review of these preferences,
moreover, reveals that  they come in all shapes and sizes  5 percent, 6.9
percent, 8 percent,  10 percent, even as high as 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to these federally sponsored preferences, judicial  and agency
interpretations of federal civil rights laws have  required state and local
governments, colleges and universities, and  private-sector employers to adopt
race and sex-based preferences in  areas such as hiring, promotions, college
admissions, and the  distribution of other privileges and benefits in our
society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates for federal office who believe in the  principle of
equal treatment under the law should emphasize the  following:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>The federal government should never favor one group of 
Americans over another on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex.</B> Race  or
sex-conscious remedies should be confined to individuals  who have demonstrated
that they have suffered discrimination.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress should clarify what constitutes discrimination.</B> A  pattern
of historical discrimination against a particular group does not  necessarily
mean an individual is subject to discrimination.  Discrimi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  nation, moreover, simply cannot be
inferred from statistical  disparities between whites and minorities (or between
men  and women) in employment, housing, or student bodies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many liberal economists and policymakers argue that virtually  all income
differences between racial groups, and between men  and women, are attributable
to discrimination. What exactly do  we know about income differences between
whites and blacks?   What are these differences?  More important, do these
differences  serve as irrefutable proof of discrimination?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) offers a statistical  perspective
common among liberals when she relies upon  statistical differences to argue
that &quot;minorities and women do not have  equal opportunity.&quot;  According
to Lee, &quot;As long as women make up  only 8 percent of engineers, 31 percent
of scientists, and 16 percent  of physicists, we have much work ahead of  us.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#2">2</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Boston University economics professor Glenn C. Loury,  however, disagrees.
Testifying before the same House subcommittee,  Professor Loury observed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     [T]here is no scientific basis for concluding that
existing  economic differences between groups are caused by, or  reflect the
extent of, discrimination. Groups differ in ways  which affect their aggregate
income, but which are often not  taken 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  into account when the groups are
compared. On my review  of the evidence, discrimination is not a major factor in
 explaining racial economic differences, and federal affirmative  action
policies over the past two decades have contributed  only marginally to the
diminution of these  differences.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#3">3</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ascertain whether any real differences exist  between groups
is to compare apples to apples by controlling  for such important factors as
age, education, and family  structure. When such comparisons are made, most, if
not all, aggregate  income differences between whites and blacks disappear. In
fact,  an honest application of the liberal assumption that  discrimination
lurks behind statistical differences leads to the conclusion that  not only is
statistical proof of discrimination extremely hard to  find, but some categories
of minorities  such as black,  college-educated females  are doing so well that
they qualify as the  &quot;innocent persons&quot; who must bear the burden of
race or  sex-conscious remedies.

<P><B>Black men and white men are not far apart when properly  compared.</B>
June O'Neill, currently director of the Congressional  Budget Office, wrote in
1990 that, while there may be  pronounced income differences between white and
black males overall,  this difference disappears when we compare blacks to
similarly  situated whites:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      Overall, black men earned 82.9 percent of the white 
wage. Adjusting for black-white differences in geographic  region, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  schooling and age raises the ratio
to 87.7 percent; adding  differences in [standardized] test scores to this list
of  characteristics raises the ratio to 95.5 percent, and adding differences  in
years of work experience raises the ratio to 99.1  percent.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Neither are black and white women.</B> Among women with  comparable
educational credentials, there is little or no difference  between whites and
blacks. The U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights found that, among women with
college degrees, black women  actually earn more than their white counterparts.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#5">5</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Citing a recent Census Bureau study, Boston University's  Glenn Loury noted
that: &quot;In 1993 there were about 400,000 college  educated black men and
women working full time as executives,  administrators or managers.... [T]he
women enjoyed median  earnings 10 percent<I> higher</I> than comparable white 
women.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#6">6</A>  Loury emphasizes
that sizable aggregate income differences do exist  between black and white
women and attributes this to the fact  that black women are far more likely to
head single-parent  households than are whites; in 1994, roughly one-half of
black families  were headed by women compared to 13 percent of white  families.<A

<P><B>Family Structure Explains Many Differences</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thomas Sowell, Senior Fellow at Stanford University's  Hoover Institution,
has found that, when education and family structure  are held constant, income
differences between whites and blacks  have been negligible for almost three
decades:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     As far back as 1969, black males who came from  homes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  where there were newspapers,
magazines and library  cards had the same incomes as whites from similar homes
and  with the same number of years of schooling. In the 1970s,  black
husband-and-wife families outside the South earned as  much as white
husband-and-wife families outside the South.  By 1981, for the country as a
whole, black  husband-and-wife families where both were college educated and
both  working earned slightly more than white families of the same  description.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>To Sowell and many other experts, white-black income  differences can be
traced to differences in family structure that became  apparent in 1960 and have
been accelerating ever since:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In every decennial census from 1920 through 1960, 
inclusive, at least 60 percent of all black males from age 15 on  up were
currently married. Moreover, the difference  between black and white males in
this respect was never as great as  5 percentage points during this entire era.
Yet, by 1980,  less than half of all black males in these age brackets were 
currently married  and the gap between black and white  males was 17 percentage
points. By 1992, that gap had widened  to 21 percentage points.<A

<P><B>What Is Affirmative Action?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Original Intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</B> Senator Hubert  H.
Humphrey (D-MN), floor manager for the 1964 Act, when  addressing one skeptical
colleague made what is perhaps the  most famous offer ever made on the Senate
floor: &quot;If the Senator  can find in title VII... any language which
provides that an  employer 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  will have to hire on the basis of
percentage or quota related  to color... I will start eating the pages one after
another, because it  is not in there.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#10">10</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Humphrey also assured the Senate that &quot;nothing in the bill  would
permit any official or court to require any employer or labor  union to give
preferential treatment to any minority group.&quot;  
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#11">11</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Senator Harrison Williams (D-NJ) also understood the 1964  Civil Rights Act
to be color-blind in its application. During floor  debate, he said: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      [T]o hire a Negro solely because he is a Negro is racial 
discrimination, just as much as a `white only'  employment policy. Both forms of
discrimination are prohibited by  Title VII of this bill. The language of that
title simply states  that race is not a qualification for employment....Some 
people charge that [the Civil Rights Act of 1964] favors the Negro,  at the
expense of the white majority. But how can the  language of equality favor one
race over another?  Equality can  have only one meaning....Those who say that
equality means  favoritism do violence to common sense.
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#12">12</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative John Lindsay (R-NY), a member of the House  Judiciary
Committee, similarly assured members that the  legislation did not favor one
group over another: &quot;[The bill] does  not...force acceptance of people in
schools, jobs, housing, or public  accommodations because they are Negro. It
does not impose quotas  or any special privileges of seniority or acceptance.
There is  nothing whatever in this bill about racial  balance.&quot;<A

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 covers over 94 million employees  in both the
public and private sectors. As controversial as the  Dole-Canady legislation may
be to liberals, it would reach only  federal workers, who comprise but 3.1
percent of the nation's work  force. Those who work for state and local
governments,  private-sector firms that receive federal contracts, and other
private sector  firms would continue to be subject to federal civil rights laws
that  require employers to favor some individuals over others on  racial,
ethnic, or gender grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Casting a Wider Net?</B> One common perception about  affirmative action
is that it began as a benign effort to combat  discrimination by requiring
employers to cast a wider net so that members of  historically neglected groups
could compete on an equal footing  for jobs and promotions. Only later, this
theory holds, did it  evolve into the current system of quotas and preferences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While this may be true in some instances, President  Lyndon Johnson laid the
foundations for today's complex web of  race-conscious programs and set-asides
as early as June 1965. &quot;[I]t  is not enough,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;to
open the gates of opportunity.&quot;   Rather, &quot;All our citizens must have
the ability to walk  through those gates.&quot;  Johnson continued: &quot;This
is the next and the  more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek
not just  freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity but human 
ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a  fact and
equality as a result.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#14">14</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, while most commentators recall the famous  declaration by Martin
Luther King, Jr., that he dreamed of the day when  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  citizen's race would not matter
and persons would be judged  &quot;not by the color of their skin but by the
content of their  character,&quot; they forget his comment two years later when
he defended  &quot;preferential treatment&quot; for minority groups in a
magazine interview: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Playboy:</B> Do you feel it's fair to request a
multibillion-dollar  program of preferential treatment for the Negro, or for any
other  minority group?

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Dr. King:</B> I do indeed.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#15">15</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today, it is common for proponents to justify affirmative action  as a group
remedy that rewards even individuals who have not  suffered from discrimination.
One of many examples of this  approach comes from Walter Dellinger, currently
Assistant Attorney  General in the U.S. Department of Justice, who defines 
affirmative action as &quot;a group-based remedy: where a group has been 
subject to discrimination, individual members of the group can  benefit from the
remedy, even if they have not proved that they have  been discriminated against
personally.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#16">16</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents of affirmative action typically deny that these  policies amount
to quotas or that they constitute any form of reverse  discrimination. Numerical
goals and timetables, they argue, are  not quotas. President Clinton's Assistant
Attorney General for  Civil Rights, Deval L. Patrick, believes that affirmative
action  policies come in three flavors:<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#17">17</A>

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Casting a wider net:</B> At one end of the spectrum are
efforts  to reach out to &quot;traditionally excluded individuals&quot; and to  &quot;recruit
talent broadly in all American communities.&quot; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Quotas:</B> At the other end of the spectrum are quotas, which  Patrick
defines as &quot;hard and fast numbers of places in school or the  workplace
specifically reserved for members of certain groups,  regardless of
qualifications.&quot;  No one supports quotas, argues  Patrick, who adds that
federal law makes these measures patently illegal.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Affirmative consideration:</B> Here lies the middle ground
of  affirmative action, where race, ethnicity, or sex is but one of many 
factors considered in evaluating qualified candidates. &quot;This form of 
consideration,&quot; Patrick explains, &quot;does not guarantee success based 
on race, ethnicity or gender. Rather it emphasizes a full range  of
qualifications and is characterized by flexibility.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is discrimination an inevitable part of affirmative action  programs? 
</B>Since the inception of affirmative action, the  Supreme Court has concluded
on several occasions that these programs  actually require discrimination
against innocent parties. For  example, former Justice Harry Blackmun admitted
in 
<I>Bakke v. State of California</I> that &quot;I suspect that it would be
impossible to arrange  an affirmative action program in a racially neutral way
and have it  be successful.... In order to get beyond racism, we must first take
 account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat  some persons
equally, we must treat them  differently.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#18">18</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Eight years later, the Court acknowledged that &quot;as part of  this
Nation's dedication to eradicating racial discrimination,  innocent persons may
be called upon to bear some of the burden of the  remedy.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#19">19</A>  Finally, in his autobiography,
Justice William O.  Douglas quoted his colleague, Justice Thurgood Marshall, as 
specifically acknowledging the discriminatory nature of race-conscious  affir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mative action policies: &quot;You
guys have been practicing  discrimination for years. Now it's our  turn.&quot;<A

</P>
<P><B>The Supreme Court's Tighter Standard for Federal  Affirmative Action
Programs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On June 12, 1995, the Supreme Court imposed a crucial and,  many would
argue, debilitating requirement on government  programs that bestow preferences
on the basis of race. The case  was <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena</I>.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#21">21</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the prime  contract for a
highway construction project in Colorado to  Mountain Gravel &amp; Construction
Company. Under the terms of the  contract, Mountain Gravel would receive a
bonus, up to 2 percent of  the total contract, if it hired subcontractors
certified as small  businesses controlled by &quot;socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#22">22</A>
 Although Adarand submitted the low bid for  the guardrail portion of the
contract, Mountain Gravel accepted  a higher bid from the Gonzales Construction
Company. Why?   Under federal law, Gonzales' designation as a &quot;socially and
 economically disadvantaged&quot; business entitled Mountain Gravel to  a
$30,000 bonus from the Department of  Transportation.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#23">23</A>  The Court held that &quot;[A]ll
racial classifications, imposed by  whatever federal, state, or local
governmental actor, must be analyzed by  a reviewing court under strict
scrutiny. In other words, such  classifications are constitutional only if they
are narrowly tailored  measures that further compelling governmental interests.&quot;

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The <I>Adarand </I>decision has prompted the Clinton Administration  to
mount an aggressive defense of existing affirmative action  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  grams that favor one race or
ethnic group over  others.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#24">24</A> 
Because <I>Adarand</I><U> </U>will cast a long shadow over congressional and 
executive branch activity on civil rights issues in 1996 and beyond, it is 
important to examine it in some detail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor  observed that
race-based distinctions in federal law are always highly  suspect, both when
they seek to harm groups that historically  have been discriminated against and
when they seek to bestow  advantages on them. O'Connor concluded that &quot;any
person, of  whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor 
subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting  that
person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial  scrutiny.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#25">25</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is there a &quot;debtor&quot; or &quot;creditor&quot; race?  
</B>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring opinions in
which  they took strong exception to any statutory or regulatory  classification
based, in whole or in part, on race. Justice Scalia wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In my view, government can never have a &quot;compelling 
interest&quot; in discriminating on the basis of race in order to  &quot;make up&quot;
for past racial discrimination in the opposite  direction. Individuals who have
been wronged by unlawful racial  discrimination should be made whole; but under
our  Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or  debtor
race.... To pursue the concept of racial entitlement  even  for the most
admirable and benign of purposes  is to  reinforce and preserve for future
mischief the way of thinking that  produced race slavery, race privilege and
race hatred. In the  eyes of the government, we are just one race here. It is 
American.<a href="ftnt13.htm#26">26</a> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Leaving the door open to future  mischief.</B> While the strict scrutiny
standard undoubtedly will force federal, state, and  local policymakers to
eliminate racial preferences from  government programs, Justices Scalia and
Thomas raise a legitimate point.  The very notion of strict scrutiny
contemplates that in some  situations, laws that favor one race over another
will pass constitutional  muster. In fact, Justice O'Connor left the door open
for legislatures  to enact laws containing more subtle forms of racial
preferences  by observing that &quot;The unhappy persistence of both the
practice  and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against  minority
groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government  is not
disqualified from acting in response to  it.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#27">27</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Looking for ways to preserve the literally hundreds of federal  laws and
regulations that contain racial preferences, President  Clinton and his
appointees have seized upon O'Connor's comment to  argue that strict scrutiny is
not really all that  strict.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#28">28</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Will Strict Scrutiny Spell the End of Race and Sex-Based  Preferences?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Former Justice Thurgood Marshall once described the strict  scrutiny
standard in constitutional cases as &quot;strict in theory, but fatal  in fact.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#29">29</A>  More recently, Justice Clarence
Thomas concluded  that, aside from two anomalous cases during World War II, 
application of this standard to racial classifications &quot;has proven 
automatically fatal.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#30">30</A> 
While legal scholars may dispute the effect of strict  scrutiny on federal
affirmative action programs, no one doubts  that <I>Adarand </I>makes it
extraordinarily difficult for these programs  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  survive in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To Justice O'Connor, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to  &quot;`smoke out'
illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative  body is pursuing a
goal important enough to warrant use of a highly  suspect tool. The test also
ensures that the means chosen `fit'  this compelling goal so closely that there
is little or no possibility  that the motive for the classification was
illegitimate racial prejudice  or stereotype.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#31">31</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What, then, does strict scrutiny mean for racial preferences in  federal
law?<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#32">32</A>  Yale Law School professor
Paul Gewirtz believes  that most, if not all, racial preferences will fall afoul
of this  standard. He argues that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Race-based affirmative action is constitutional only where
it  addresses the effects of discrimination in the most  circumscribed sense.</B>
Despite the best efforts of President Clinton and his  appointees to rally
around the mantra of diversity, a majority of  justices now reject both
diversity and inclusion as independent goals  for affirmative action.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#33">33</A>  In doing so, the Court has put
the  Congress on notice that literally hundreds of federal programs and 
regulations are unconstitutional. Justice O'Connor has said that  diversity &quot;is
clearly not a compelling interest,&quot; rests on &quot;illegitimate 
stereotypes,&quot; and is &quot;too amorphous, too insubstantial, and too 
unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing racial  classifications.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Affirmative action may be used only where Congress can  show that actual
discrimination has occurred.</B> This requires hard  evidence that
discrimination exists in the local market and  sector where affirmative action
is used. Courts are increasingly  reluctant 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  to accept inferences that
statistical disparities among racial  groups are caused by local discrimination
rather than by other  factors. Thus, an affirmative action program that gives
preferences to  minority-owned engineering firms in awarding contracts would  be
more likely to pass constitutional muster if officials could  demonstrate that
the basis of the alleged statistical underrepresentation  is the relevant pool
of qualified applicants  the number of  minority-owned engineering firms
financially capable of bidding for  these contracts in the geographic area in
question  rather than the  overall percentage of minorities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Racial preferences must be narrowly tailored to remedy  identifiable
discrimination.</B> Race-based methods may be used only  (a) after race-neutral
means are considered; (b) to the extent  shown necessary to remedy the scope of
the identified discrimination;  (c) where the individual seeking a racial
preference has suffered  from the effects of the past discrimination; and (d) if
undue burdens  on nonbeneficiaries   such as layoffs  are avoided. As

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Constitutional considerations may compel the courts to
defer  to Congress more generally on affirmative action issues.</B>  Dellinger
drives an enormous loophole through<I>  Adarand</I> when he argues that
Congress may be able to justify remedial racial and ethnic  classifications
simply by including &quot;national findings of  discrimination&quot; in the
prologue to legislation. Congress, he argues, enjoys  express constitutional
power to remedy discrimination against  minorities and therefore has more
latitude to engage in race-based  affirmative action than do state and local
governments. But he cautions  that Congress may not use evidence of &quot;generalized,
historical  societal discrimination&quot; to justify racial preferences. Rather,
it &quot;must  have some particularized evidence about the existence and effects
 of discrimination in the sectors and industries for which it  prescribes racial

action, he recommends the  use of controversial and discredited &quot;disparity

<P><B>Ignoring the Law in Pursuit of Racial and Sex-Based  Preferences - The
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal  Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the  federal prohibition against
employment discrimination, as well as  prohibitions against discrimination
contained in the Americans with  Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination Act, Equal
Pay Act, and  other civil rights laws. The commission investigates allegations
of  discrimination by individuals, unions, associations, and others and,  if the
claims are not settled out of court, brings civil suit  seeking damages against
responsible parties. Unfortunately, the EEOC  has abused this authority by
assuming that any statistical disparity  between the races in employment results
from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Does Federal Law Require the EEOC to Use Quotas? The  answer clearly is &quot;No.&quot;
 During floor debate on the Civil Rights Act  of 1964, some Members of the House
questioned whether the  bill's employment provisions would force private-sector
employers  to adopt quotas. Judiciary Committee Chairman Emmanuel  Celler (D-NY)
assured them that &quot;The charge... that the Equal  Employment Opportunity
Commission to be established by Title VII  of the bill would have the power
to... order the hiring and  promotion only of employees of certain races or
religious groups... is  patently false.&quot;  Celler also denied emphatically
that the EEOC would  have the authority to remedy racial or religious imbalances
by  requiring &quot;the hiring of certain people without regard to their 
qualifications simply because they are of a given race or religion.&quot;

In fact, the very  opposite is true. Title VII prohibits discrimination. In
effect, it  says that race, religion, and national origin are not to be used  as
the basis for hiring and firing. Title VII is designed to  encourage hiring on
the basis of ability and qualifications, not  race or religion.<A

might have applied for work there but never did so, and then pay  these
individuals a total of $123,000 in &quot;back pay.&quot;  After  considerable

rejected the EEOC's  claims, concluding that potential black employees faced
high  commuting costs due to the firm's location in a Hispanic and Asian part 
of Chicago and that the company's lack of an English fluency  requirement meant
it naturally would receive a  disproportionate number of applications from

financial resources to pay their own way through college.  In fact, the
scholarships exceeded the actual financial need of all  but eight students.<A

ones, automatically receive full tuition and  a stipend to cover three years of
expenses; low-income white  students, on the other hand, receive a maximum
stipend of two  years. As summed up by Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield,  &quot;Blacks
are compared with other blacks and not really with whites;  and there are
separate funds as well, the purpose of which is to  keep the professors on the

<P>Many corporations, hoping to immunize themselves from  expensive

<P>Two experts who have reviewed the U.S. military's  experience with
affirmative action believe that it could serve as a model  for such programs in
the private sector and other government  agencies. According to former White

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     One of the keys to the military's recent 
success...in...dealing with race relations...has been its insistence on each 
recruit's meeting the same employment standards. Virtually every  recruit is
required to have a high school diploma. This policy  is the result of decades of
data demonstrating that high  school achievement as represented by a diploma is
more  predictive than aptitude tests of adaptability to military life and 
likelihood of serving out an entire tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     With the same employment standards required of each  recruit, it should
come as no surprise that the military can  make integration work...Indeed,
notwithstanding the relatively  high minority drop-out rate, the percentage of
blacks in the  military, virtually all of whom have diplomas, is nearly twice 
the national percentage. <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#85">85</A>

As Moskos explains it, the system works  as follows:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     The goal for the number of minorities promoted to the 
next highest rank is based not on the overall number of  minorities in the Army,
but on the number of minorities in the pool  of those qualified for promotion.
The military has no hint of  two promotion lists, whites being compared only
with  whites, blacks only with blacks. From enlistment on up, all  candidates
are held to the same standard.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     The number of blacks who are promoted from captain to  major, a virtual
prerequisite for an officer seeking an Army  career, is usually below the
goal....The most plausible  explanation is that a disproportionate number of
black officers  lack the writing and communication skills for promotion to 
staff jobs. In all other ranks, including colonel through  general officers,
promotions show little racial differences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     Strict maintenance of common standards for  promotion... means that
those who attain senior positions are fully  qualified. Also important, those
blacks who are promoted have  a self-confidence that makes them the strongest
defenders  of standards for their own black subordinates.<A

students  improve an astounding 140 points, bringing them into the same range 
as typical white students.&quot;  Unlike California's Bridge Program,  these
programs are not targeted exclusively at minority soldiers.  Their
beneficiaries, however, are disproportionately  African-American. The bottom
line?  According to Moskos, &quot;no identifiable groups  of

precludes private-sector employers from adopting  the military's version of
affirmative action.  In<I> Griggs</I>, the Court determined that diplomas could
not be a condition of employment  because blacks had lower graduation rates and

punishing  employers for rewarding academic achievement. More important,  the

workplace rewards for academic  achievement have been abandoned.<A

private-sector employers to emulate the Pentagon's version  of affirmative

insofar as they can be interpreted to  put any inhibition on any employer's

 This could be accomplished easily by amending the  rules to provide that &quot;No

performance from those they know to have been preferred in the process  of
selection. Moreover, affirmative action sometimes leaves  its beneficiaries
uncertain about the basis of their own  accomplishments. Blacks promoted to

considerable attention on Capitol Hill. Since that time,  however, Congress has
not taken legislative action. As Congress turns  to issues outside the Contract
With America, legislation  addressing quotas will likely be deliberated.

</P>
<P>Although racial preferences reach into virtually every aspect  of American
society, legislation currently being considered in  Congress leaves most federal
preference discrimination  untouched. Though the debate no doubt will be
extremely controversial,  success even in this limited area would be unusually
significant  because it was the federal government, through the judicial 
activism of liberal Supreme Courts, which established the current regime  of
legal race privileges. It is proper, therefore, for Congress to  reassert its
constitutional role and restore the timeless principle  of equal treatment under
the law for all Americans by ridding  the public sector of such veiled
restitution and social experimentation.

<P>
</P>
<P>In 1996, Congress will consider the Equal Opportunity Act  of 1995,
introduced by Senator Robert Dole (R-KS) and  Representative Charles Canady
(R-FL). This legislation would implement  the <I>Adarand</I> decision by
eliminating race and sex consciousness  from all federal programs and
activities. Professor Carl Cohen of  the University of Michigan has summed up
the philosophical  premise of this legislation:

<P>What would the Dole-Canady legislation do?  The  Dole-Canady Equal
Opportunity Act of 1995 <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#116">116</A>
seeks to accomplish two  broad goals: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Equal Treatment:</B> &quot;The purpose of this Act is
to ensure that  all Americans are treated equally by the Federal government in 
Federal employment, Federal contracting and subcontracting, and 
Federally-conducted programs.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#117">117</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Equal Opportunity:</B> &quot;The Act endorses those Federal 
`affirmative action' programs that are designed to recruit broadly and widen 
the opportunities for competition without guaranteeing the results  of the
competition.&quot;  At the same time, the bill would eliminate  those federal
activities that create quotas, set-asides, timetables,  goals, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  and other preferences on the
basis of race, color, national origin,  or sex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The legislation reflects the view that the federal government  must put its
own house in order with respect to racial and gender  preferences. Specifically,
the bill:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Bans race or sex-based preferences in federal programs.</B> The 
federal government, its officers, and its employees would have to  end all
intentional discrimination based &quot;in whole or in part on  race, color,
national origin, or sex&quot; with respect to contracts,  subcontracts, and
employment. In addition, no federal entity would  be allowed to &quot;grant a
preference&quot; to any individual or group on  the basis of race, sex, or
ethnicity. As defined broadly in the  Act, granting a preference includes &quot;any
preferential treatment and  includes but is not limited to any use of a quota,
set-aside,  goal, timetable, or other numerical objective.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Prohibits the federal government from encouraging federal 
contractors and subcontractors to adopt race or sex-based preferences.</B>   The
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs  (OFCCP) would no longer be
allowed to pressure firms that receive  federal contracts or subcontracts to
adopt racial or gender quotas.  Located in the Department of Labor, OFCCP
receives an annual  appropriation of $60 million to monitor the hiring practices
of federal  contractors with respect to race, ethnicity, and sex. Its
jurisdiction  extends to more than $161 billion in annual federal contracting 
activity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Protects outreach, recruiting, and marketing efforts designed  to
bring more qualified minorities and women to the attention of  em
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  ployers, colleges, and
universities.</B> Federal programs that are  targeted on minorities but do not &quot;guarantee
the results of the  competition&quot; would continue in place. One example is a
small program  in the U.S. Department of Agriculture<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#118">118</A> which provides support  for
campus recruitment and retention programs and agricultural  career awareness
initiatives in order to increase the participation of  minorities in agriculture
without subjecting participating schools  to any numerical goals or timetables.

<P><B>*     Exempts Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HCBUs) and

<P>
</P>
<P>-     Dozens of agency-specific regulations that reach every program  in an
agency's jurisdiction, even where the authorizing law makes  no mention of race

practice of conditioning  federal employee evaluations and bonuses on whether
employers have  met their affirmative action goals.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Enact the Dole-Canady Equal Opportunity Act of 1995 
(H.R. 2128/S. 1085).</B> Enactment of this legislation represents the  first
step toward a true policy of equal treatment under the law.  It would end the
federal government's practice of favoring  women and minorities in the
allocation of over $160 billion of federal  contracts; establish race-neutral
and sex-neutral principles in the  hiring, promotion, and evaluation of all
federal employees; end  the imposition of federal racial quotas on
private-sector firms that  do business with the government; and end
discriminatory practices  in the operation of hundreds of federal programs that
award over  $10 billion annually.

<P><B>*     Restore the original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</B> 
The guiding principle behind the Dole-Canady bill  equal  treatment under the
law  must be extended to employees of state and  local governments, colleges and
universities, and all private-sector  employers. To accomplish this, Congress
must restore the  original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by adding
language that  ech
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  oes former Justice Thurgood
Marshall's statement that the  1964 Act &quot;prohibits all racial
discrimination in employment,  without exception for any group of particular
employees.&quot;  Congress  must explicitly forbid courts and administrative
agencies from  construing Title VII of the 1964 Act as authorizing, permitting,
or  encouraging the use of quotas or preferences involving race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin.

race-exclusive scholarships, special financial assistance programs,  and relaxed

<P><B>Q. Would enactment of the Dole-Canady legislation result in  race and
gender neutrality for all Americans? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Because the Dole-Canady bill only reaches federal  employees
and federal programs, it would not affect affirmative  action practices that,
thanks to overzealous judges and agency  bureaucrats who have misconstrued the
original intent of the 1964  Civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  Rights Act, have become the norm
in the private sector, in  state and local government, and at colleges and
universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do you want to eliminate protections for people who  are
discriminated against?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> In fact, the original Civil Rights legislation in 1964, which  is
still on the books, protects everyone of all races and creeds  from
discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 still provides  this protection on
an individual basis. It is the courts, through  undue judicial activism, which
have miscontrued the legal application  of these laws to allow racial
preferences for certain favored races  at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As Justice Scalia stated in his <I>Adarand</I> opinion, there can be  no &quot;debtor
race.&quot;  In order for civil rights to be something other than  a tool for
veiled restitution and retribution, the legal protection  from discrimination
must only attach to individuals on a case by  case basis. Any other application
must result in an unfair system of  racial preferences and government-sponsored
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can conservatives call for a color blind society when 
discrimination exists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is first important to realize that the federal government is 
limited in its ability to address such social maladies as racial 
discrimination. The best it can do is to end those government  programs that
promote discrimination. Affirmative action programs not  only promote
discrimination; discrimination is the fundamental  principle behind of these
programs.
