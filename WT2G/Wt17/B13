<DL>
<DD>In the past, the general area of trademark and unfair competition law has been decidedly colorful.  As one court recently noted:<P>
<DL>
<DD>
Saddam Hussein wants to keep advertisers from using his picture in unflattering contexts.  Clint Eastwood doesn't want tabloids to write about him.  Rudolf Valentino's heirs want to control his film biography.  The Girl Scouts don't want their image soiled by association with certain activities.  George Lucas wants to keep Strategic Defense Initiative fans from calling it "Star Wars."  Pepsico doesn't want singers to use the word "Pepsi" in their songs.  Guy Lombardo wants an exclusive property right to ads that show big bands playing on New Year's Eve.  Uri Geller thinks he should be paid for ads showing psychics bending metal through telekinesis.  Paul Prudhomme, that household name, thinks the same about ads featuring corpulent bearded chefs.  And scads of copyright holders see purple when their creations are made fun of.<P>
</DL>
<EM>Vanna White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc.</EM>, 989 F.2d 1512, 1512-13 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 2443 (1993).  It should be no surprise, therefore, that in 1994 companies and individuals have sought to further expand the boundaries of trademark law and to seek the passage of new legislation to protect their competitive interests.  Companies must be aware, therefore, of the potential rights they or others may have before making or implementing business plans.  The following discussion highlights some of the hottest issues in the area.<P>

<H2><A NAME="color">COLOR AS A TRADEMARK</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>The traditional rule is that color, per se, is not capable of appropriation as a trademark.  That is, one seller cannot make a product or its packaging in a certain color and prevent competitors from adopting the same color for their products or packaging.  Color in connection with a definite design may, however, be protected as part of the overall trademark.  The circuits are split on the question of whether to give color alone the protection of a trademark.  The majority of circuits have refused to grant such protection.  <EM>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc.</EM>, 13 F.3d 1297 (9th Cir.), cert. granted, 115 S. Ct. 40 (1994); (trademark registration for green-gold color in connection with dry cleaning press pads is invalid; court held one cannot register color alone as a trademark; <EM>Nutra Sweet Co. v. Stadt Corp.</EM>, 917 F.2d 1024, 1027 (7th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 983 (1991) (blue packet for tabletop sweetener not protectable as a trademark).  <EM>Cf. Master Distributors, Inc. v. Pako, supra</EM>, (blue leader for tape may be protected as a trademark); <EM>In re Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp.</EM>, 227 U.S.P.Q. 417 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (pink for fiberglass a protectable trademark); <EM>Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull Ltd.</EM>, No. 941049-1050, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 25150 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  (Court rejected per se rule regarding protection but determined that color black could not be registered for Mercury's outboard motors because black is functional); <EM>R.L. Winston Rod Co. v. Sage Mf'd Co.</EM>, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1779 (D. Mont. 1993) (plaintiff failed to show that color green for graphite fishing rods was a protectable trademark).<P>
<LI>The traditional rule is justified by the "color depletion" or "color monopolization" theory.  As one court explains:  "If they may thus monopolize red in all of its shades, the next manufacturer may monopolize orange in all of its shades and the next, yellow in the same way.  Obviously, the list of colors will soon run out."  <EM>Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour & Co.</EM>, 175 F.2d 795, (3d Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 847, 94 L.Ed. 518, 70 S. Ct. 88 (1949).  See, e.g., <EM>First Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc.</EM>, 809 F.2d 1378 (9th Cir. 1987) ("Under the color depletion theory, there are a limited number of colors in the palette which may be depleted if trademark registrants prevail."); <EM>Diamond Match Co. v. Saginaw Match Co.</EM>, 142 F. 727 (6th Cir. 1906), cert. denied, 203 U.S. 589 (1906) ("The primary colors, even adding black and white, are but few.  If two of these colors can be appropriated for one brand of tipped matches, it will not take long to appropriate the rest.").<P>
<LI>Color depletion supporters further argue that, while in theory there may be hundreds of shades of colors, the ordinary person has a limited ability to distinguish shades.  Practical limitations may also limit the range of colors available for a product or package.  See Summerfield, <EM>"Color as a Trademark and the Mere Color Rule:  The Circuit Split for Color Alone."</EM>  68 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 973, 996-997 (1993).  (For example, only a certain number of colors are available for children's toys because of government toxicity standards.  Dark colors are unattractive for containers of many food products, such as milk and ice cream.  "Dark colored packages tend to look used, and people do not want to buy goods that look as if they had been handled a lot.")<P>
<LI>On the other hand, others note that the color depletion theory ignores economic realities.  Economic pressures generally limit the number of competitors in any one field.  Thus, in actuality, there are plenty of colors available for a company to select that are not being used by their competitors.  See, e.g., <EM>Master Distributors Inc. v. Pako Corp.</EM>, 986 F.2d 219 (8th Cir. 1993) ("Until secondary meaning has been established in every distinguishable shade of color  . . . there will always be an option available to a new market entrant."  Court noted a color atlas listed 1,266 colors); <EM>DAP Products v. Color Tile Mfg., Inc.</EM>, 821 F. Supp. 488 (S.D. Ohio 1993) ("While there may be attractive arguments in favor of the color depletion theory, the court concludes that it is not a persuasive theory in light of available contemporary technology.  There are a myriad of colors and shades available for products today that were certainly not available in the past."  Preliminary injunction granted against use of 3-1/2 gallon red bucket containing mastic adhesive.).<P>
<LI>On September 26, 1994, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in the Qualitex, supra, case for the sole purpose of deciding whether color per se should be registrable as a trademark in order to resolve the split in the Circuits.  The question formally before the Court is whether the Lanham Act prohibits registration of color per se.  The Court may, however, wander from this issue and discuss the protectability of color as a trademark under unfair competition principles and Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.<P>
<LI>We anticipate that the Supreme Court will hold that the Lanham Act does not prohibit registration of color per se as a trademark.  On its face, the statute does not explicitly bar the registration of color as a trademark.  Indeed, there are currently numerous registrations for marks consisting mainly of a single color.  The Court may also indicate that the protection of color as a trademark should be determined using established trademark principles of secondary meaning, inherent distinctiveness and functionality, rather than by the application of any per se rule.<P>

<H2><A NAME="thenet">THE INTERNET</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>Advertising, marketing and communicating with customers over global computer and information networks is becoming an increasingly important component of running a successful business.  While the National Information Infrastructure may be years away, the Internet is up and running with millions of active users.  Domain names, the computer addresses in cyberspace, are being assigned at a rate of over 1,300 per month.  Companies should consider reserving domain names before desired addresses are taken by someone else.<P>
<LI>Some companies have not reacted quickly to the need for domain names.  For example, McDonalds lost out on mcdonalds.com.  The holder, who can be reached at ronald@mcdonalds.com, is willing to sell the domain name to McDonalds for a fair price.  MTV has a similar problem.  While working at MTV, video disc jockey Adam Curry used the domain name mtv.com for a daily entertainment update.  When Curry left MTV, he kept his Internet service running with the mtv.com address.  MTV promptly sued, and while Curry has agreed not to use the lucrative mtv.com address during the pendency of the lawsuit, he refuses to willingly give up the domain name to MTV.<P>
<LI>Companies may also take advantage of a competitor's failure to reserve a domain name.  The college test preparation service The Princeton Review surprised its key competitor Stanley Kaplan by grabbing the domain name kaplan.com.  After binding arbitration The Princeton Review was forced to give the kaplan.com domain name to Stanley Kaplan.<P>
<LI>Internet domain names are assigned on a first come-first serve basis by the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC).  InterNIC can be reached at 703/742-4777 or at hostmaster @ internic.net.  Demand for domain names has been so overwhelming that InterNIC has recently limited domain names to one per company.<P>
<LI>InterNIC does not allow preemptive reservations of domain names.  If your business is not yet ready to connect to the Internet, there are a variety of private companies that will identify whether particular domain names are available, reserve a domain name for you, set up that domain name on their computer and hold it for you until you are ready to form your own connection to the Internet.  Service providers may also send you any inquiries addressed to your domain name.<P>
<LI>Steps must be taken to prevent others from using your company's name or marks as Internet domain names.  While InterNIC will not knowingly register a misleading name, it does not become involved in any disputes over registration.  Disputes over misappropriation or use of confusingly similar domain names are private matters between the parties.  It is likely that general principles of trademark and unfair competition law will apply in cyberspace.<P>
<LI>Businesses should review their trademark portfolios and verify that they hold trademark registrations for the block format of the company's name and major products.  To strengthen trademark rights in domain names, companies should consider filing trademark applications for these names for use in connection with online services and computer networks.<P>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="minn">MINNESOTA'S ANTI-DILUTION STATUTE</A></H2>
<DL>
<DD>On August 1, 1994, Minnesota became one of a growing number of states to enact a "anti-dilution" statute.  Minnesota's statute provides:<P>
<DL>
<DD>Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name shall be grounds for injunctive relief, regardless of the presence or the absence of competition between the parties or likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception.<P>
<DD>For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings given them:<P>
</DL>
<DL>
<DD>
<OL>
<LI>"dilution" means the lessening of the capacity of an owner's mark to identify and distinguish goods or services; and<P>
<LI>"distinctive quality" means the mark is inherently distinctive or has acquired distinctiveness, and the mark is well known or famous.<P>
</OL>
</DL>
Minn. Stat. § 325D.165.  Minnesota courts have not yet interpreted Minnesota's anti-dilution statute.  The statute could significantly expand protection for established trademarks.<P>
</DL>
<UL>
<LI>Protection of trademarks has traditionally been afforded through actions for trademark infringement.  To prove a trademark infringement claim, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's use of a mark is likely to cause confusion, deception or mistake that the defendant's goods or services were produced by, sponsored by or otherwise affiliated with the plaintiff.  Anti-dilution statutes, on the other hand, do not require any showing of "likelihood of confusion."  A trademark owner can seek to enjoin a use of a mark even if a reasonably prudent buyer is not likely to mistake the origin or affiliation of a product.<P>
<LI>Anti-dilution statutes have been commonly used to attack uses which tend to weaken or "blur" the unique association of a well-known trademark with the trademark's owner.  See, e.g., <EM>Polaroid Corp. v. Polaraid, Inc.</EM>, 319 F.2d 830 (7th Cir. 1963).  (Prohibiting the use of the mark POLARAID in connection with the installation of refrigeration and heating systems.)  <EM>See also Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Celozzi-Ettleson Chevrolet, Inc.</EM>, 855 F.2d 480 (7th Cir. 1988) (enjoining defendant used-car dealer's use of the slogan THE GREATEST USED CAR SHOW ON EARTH); <EM>Tiffany & Co. v. Boston Club, Inc.</EM>, 231 F. Supp. 836, 844 (D. Mass. 1964) (enjoining Boston restaurant's use of New York jeweler's TIFFANY mark).<P>
<LI>Anti-dilution statutes have also often been invoked in instances of "tarnishment,"  i.e., when a defendant uses the same or a similar mark in a way that creates an undesirable, unwholesome, or unsavory mental association with the plaintiff's mark or product.  For example, the Eighth Circuit recently found that the publication in a St. Louis humor magazine of a mock advertisement for "Michelob Oily", featuring such graphics as a can of Michelob® spilling out of an oily fish, tarnished Anheuser-Busch's famous Michelob® mark by suggesting that Michelob® contains oil.  <EM>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Balducci Publications</EM>, 28 F.3d 769, 777 (8th Cir. 1994).  <EM>See also Community Fed. Sav. and Loan v. Orondorff</EM>, 678 F.2d 1034, 1035-37 (11th Cir. 1982) (defendant's use in connection with a strip club of a mark similar to bank's COOKIE JAR mark for automatic tellers); <EM>Eastman Kodak Co. v. Rakow</EM>, 739 F. Supp. 116, 118 (W.D.N.Y. 1989) (defendant's use of the name KODAK in connection with a sexually-explicit comedy act); <EM>American Express Co. v. Vibra Approved Lab. Corp.</EM>, 10 U.S.P.Q.2d 2006, 2014 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (defendant's use of mark similar to the AMERICAN EXPRESS mark in connection with a "condom card").<P>
<LI>A recent decision of the Second Circuit illustrates that anti-dilution statutes are broad enough to provide protection to strong marks beyond the bounds defined by the usual notions of blurring and tarnishment.  In <EM>Deere & Co. v. MTD Products Inc.</EM>, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 33042, 32 U.S.P.Q.2d 1936 (2d Cir. 1994), the Second Circuit affirmed a district court's invocation of New York's anti-dilution law in granting a preliminary injunction against a television commercial for MTD's "Yard-Man" line of lawn tractors.  In the commercial, MTD portrays Deere's well-known "leaping deer" silhouette as a small, animated creature.  The deer looks over its shoulder, running in apparent fear, as it is pursued by a Yard-Man lawn tractor and a barking dog.  According to the advertisement's producers, the message of the commercial was that Deere, the market leader, had much to fear from MTD's Yard-Man line of less costly but allegedly comparable lawn tractors.  After noting that that commercial did not result in the "blurring" of a mark by use on a dissimilar product or the "tarnishment" of a mark by portraying it in an unwholesome context, the court determined that MTD's alteration of Deere's mark had the potential to lessen the selling power of a distinctive mark.<P>
<LI>While Minnesota's anti-dilution statute is broad and offers a potentially powerful and expansive tool for trademark owners, the statute does have significant limits which should not be overlooked:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Minnesota's anti-dilution statute explicitly limits its protection to marks that are "well known or famous."  Courts in other states have also limited protection from blurring and tarnishment to "well known or famous" marks.  This limitation could significantly restrict the use of the anti-dilution statute.<P>
<LI>Minnesota's anti-dilution statute creates a right to injunctive relief but does not provide for the award of monetary damages.<P>
<LI>The injunctive relief obtained may be limited.  Some courts have held that injunctions granted under anti-dilution statutes should be limited geographically to the state under whose law the action was commenced.  <EM>Compare Hyatt Corp. v. Hyatt Legal Services</EM>, 610 F. Supp. 381 (N.D. Ill. 1985) and Deere & Co., 32 U.S.P.Q.2d 1936 with <EM>Champions Golf Club, Inc. v. Sunrise Land Corp.</EM>, 846 F. Supp. 742, 759 (W.D. Ark. 1994); Eastman Kodak, 739 F. Supp. at 120 n.3; <EM>Instrumentalist Co. v. Marine Corps League</EM>, 509 F. Supp. 323, 340 (N.D. Ill. 1981), aff'd, 694 F.2d 145 (7th Cir. 1982).<P>
</OL>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="immoral">IMMORAL, DISPARAGING OR SCANDALOUS TRADEMARKS</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>In the past, 15 USC § 1052(a) has been invoked by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to refuse registration of QUEEN MARY for women's underwear, (<EM>Ex parte Martha Maid Mfg. Co.</EM>, 37 U.S.P.Q. 156 (Comm'r Pats. 1938)), MADONNA for wine (<EM>In re P.J. Valckenberg, GmbH</EM>, 122 U.S.P.Q. 334 (TTAB 1959)), and SENUSSI, the name of a Moslem sect whose adherents are forbidden the use of tobacco, for cigarettes (<EM>In re Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH</EM>, 122 U.S.P.Q. 339 (TTAB 1959), aff'd, 289 F.2d 506 (1961)), on the grounds that the marks were immoral, disparaging or scandalous.<P>
<LI>Because the scandalous nature of a mark is determined in the context of contemporary attitudes, more recent decisions have allowed the registration of marks that before may have been once considered immoral or otherwise not appropriate.  See, e.g., <EM>In re Old Glory Condom Corp.</EM>, 26 U.S.P.Q.2d 1216 (TTAB 1993) (OLD GLORY CONDOM CORP with a design featuring a condom with stars and stripes suggesting the American flag); In re Hershey, 6 U.S.P.Q.2d 1470 (TTAB 1988) (BIG PECKER BRAND for t-shirts); In re Madsen, 180 U.S.P.Q. 334 (TTAB 1973) (WEEK-END SEX for magazines).<P>
<LI>With the increasing pervasiveness of political correctness, it should not be surprising that 1994 saw significant controversy in connection with 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a)'s prohibition against registration of trademarks consisting of immoral, disparaging or scandalous matter.<P>
<LI>In <EM>In re Mavety Media Group</EM>, 33 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Federal Circuit reversed the PTO's refusal to register the mark BLACK TAIL for an adult entertainment magazine featuring photographs of nude and scantily-clad African-American women on the grounds that the mark was a scandalous and vulgar reference to female African-American sexual partners.  The magazine's owner argued there were alternative meanings of the terms in question, such as a "non-vulgar" reference to a woman's "rear end" and a reference to a type of full dress tuxedo worn by men at formal occasions.<P>
<LI>The Federal Circuit noted that "even if members of this panel find the mark BLACK TAIL disgustingly scandalous, the legal conclusion that a trademark comprises scandalous matter must derive from the perspective of [a] substantial composite [of the general public]."  The Court held that where there are possible alternative interpretations of the meaning of the terms in question, the PTO could not refuse registration of a mark without further factual support for its conclusion that a substantial composite of the general public would find the mark scandalous.<P>
<LI>In <EM>In re Hines</EM>, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1685 (TTAB 1994), the PTO initially invoked § 1052(a) to refuse to register for t-shirts, sweatshirts, shorts and hats the mark BUDDA BEACHWEAR with a drawing depicting a figure similar to the likeness of Gautama Buddha who is revered by Buddhists.  In initially refusing to register the mark, the PTO found that the particular portrayal of Gautama Buddha, "whose image is the subject of devotion of Buddhists each and every day", "in palm tree-emblazoned casual wear for commercial purposes . . . slights, depreciates and cheapens Buddha and Buddhism", and therefore is "disparaging" within the meaning of § 1052(a).<P>
<LI>After receiving the Federal Circuit's opinion in <EM>In re Mavety Media Group, Ltd.</EM>, the PTO reconsidered its position and decided to defer final decision on registration of BUDDA BEACHWEAR until after publishing the mark for opposition and considering the opinions of members of the general public during the opposition period.  <EM>In re Mavety Media Group, Ltd.</EM>, 32 U.S.P.Q.2d 1376 (TTAB 1994).<P>
<LI>In <EM>Harjo v. Pro Football Inc.</EM>, 30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1828 (TTAB 1994) the PTO dismissed most of the Washington Redskins' affirmative defenses to a § 1052(a) based challenge to the team's valuable REDSKINS trademark registrations.  The petitioners in Harjo are a group of Native American persons enrolled as members of federally-recognized tribes.  The petitioners seek cancellation of the team's registrations on grounds that "the term REDSKIN is a pejorative, derogatory, degrading, offensive, scandalous, contemptuous, disreputable, disparaging and racist designation for a Native American person."  Among the affirmative defenses dismissed by the PTO were lack of standing, equitable estoppel, and laches.<P>
<LI>The PTO's dismissal of many of the team's affirmative defenses does not constitute a final ruling on the petitioners' request for cancellation of the registrations.  The team may still assert various defenses, including the First Amendment.  A final ruling from the PTO will likely come in 1995.<P>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="trade">TRADE DRESS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>"Trade dress" is the total image or overall impression of a company's product, packaging and advertising.  Traditionally, trade dress was thought to consist only of the appearance of labels, wrappers and containers used in packaging the product.  Trade dress is now defined to encompass the total look of a product and its packaging and even includes the design and shape of the product itself.  Trade dress has been held to include such things as the cover of a book; a magazine cover design; the appearance of a teddy bear; a Rubik's cube puzzle; the shape of a classic automobile; the appearances of a lamp, a sports shoe, a video game console, water meter and even the decor of a restaurant.<P>
<LI>To be protectable, trade dress must be distinctive and nonfunctional.  Recently, courts have been reluctant to find protectable trade dress or infringement of any trade dress rights.  The following cases are illustrative:<P>
<OL>
<LI>In <EM>Aromatique Inc. v. Gold Seal Inc.</EM>, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1481 (8th Cir. 1994), the Eighth Circuit cancelled two federal trademark registrations for the plaintiff's alleged trade dress and reversed the district court's judgment of trade dress infringement.  The trade dress for the plaintiff's potpourri products included a pillow-shaped double cellophane bag closed with a cord tied in a square knot bow.  The Court held that since this type of package was commonplace, the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence of secondary meaning, and the various features of the dress were functional, there was no trade dress protection available.<P>
<LI><EM>Speciality Surgical Instrumentation v. Phillips</EM>, 30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1309 (M.D. Tenn. 1994) (Color gray used in promotional materials for surgical instruments is not protectable trade dress.  Gray background highlights design of instruments in catalogues and there is a competitive need for color gray in industry.  The color is, therefore, primarily functional and cannot be protected.)<P>
<LI><EM>Jungle Rags Inc. v. Rainbow Graphics Inc.</EM>, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1704 (M.D. Fla. 1993) (Cartoon drawing of an animal with a primarily nonfunctional applique flap forming animal's mouth was not protectable as trade dress because it was not inherently distinctive and there was no showing of acquired secondary meaning.)<P>
</UL>
<LI>If registered, however, trade dress protection can be formidable.  In <EM>Shakespeare Co. v. Silstar Corp. of America, Inc.</EM>, 9 F.3d 1091, 28 U.S.P.Q.2d 1765 (7th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 2134 (1994), the court refused to cancel the federal trademark registration for Shakespeare's "Ugly Stik" fishing rods for both salt and fresh water fishing.  These rods feature a "clear tip."  Shakespeare had obtained a federal trademark registration for the clear tip.  The defendant argued that the clear tip was functional and, therefore, could not be protected as a trademark.  This case underscores the importance of obtaining a federal registration.  Marks registered on the Principal Register and in continuous use for five years can become incontestable under 15 U.S.C. § 1065, significantly limiting the grounds a defendant has available to challenge the validity of the mark and registration, including functionality.  Because Shakespeare's trademark registration for its clear tip had become incontestable, the registration could not be cancelled for functionality.<P>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="misc">MISCELLANEOUS CHUCKLES</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>Each year has its fair share of amusing cases.  1994 was no different.  For example, <EM>Munsingwear Inc. v. Jockey Int'l Inc.</EM>, 31 USPQ 2d 1146 (D. Minn. 1994) involved the marketing of a horizontal-fly version of men's underwear by Jockey.  Munsingwear contended that Jockey's "Pouch" line of briefs infringed Munsingwear's rights in its horizontal fly design.  In determining whether there was likelihood of consumer confusion between the parties' horizontal fly underwear, the court ruled that the presence of likelihood of confusion should be based on a comparison of the parties' products in their pre-sale, or packaged, form.  This time frame was selected based on the astute observation that after underwear is sold, it is customarily concealed under other articles of clothing.  Thus, the potential for customer confusion is unlikely due to the lack of post-sale exposure.<P>
<LI>In late December 1994, Carl Sagan lost his battle with Apple Computer.  In connection with its new Power Macintosh 7100-66 computer it was designing, Apple has used Sagan's name as an in house code for the computer.  Sagan complained to Apple contending, inter alia, that the use of his name was an invasion of privacy.  After receiving Sagan's complaint, Apple engineers changed the moniker to "BHA," short for "BUTT HEAD ASTRONOMER."  Sagan sued for copyright infringe-ment, unfair competition, libel, invasion of privacy, and violation of his right of publicity.  The Court dismissed Sagan's lawsuit in large part because Apple's use of "BHA" had been strictly in-house.  Truth as a defense to the libel charge was not discussed by the Court.<P>

<TITLE>Recent developments in the law of cyberspace</TITLE>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
1994 saw a number of important developments relating to the law of cyberspace (e.g., the Internet, on-line services, bulletin boards).  Just as a decade ago, when the courts first struggled with the application of copyright law to computer programs, courts today are now facing the first generation of cases relating to cyberspace.  These lawsuits and related legislative developments may define the basic principles governing the law of cyberspace for years to come.
</DL>
<H2>Copyright</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Copyright infringement is endemic in cyberspace.  While much copying is justified by the doctrine of fair use, which permits in limited circumstances what would otherwise technically be infringement, illegal copying poses a significant problem for copyright owners.  The copyright system is threatened by cyberspace because of the ease of copying, the problems of effective enforcement, and the Internet sub-culture which asserts that "information wants to be free."<P>
<LI>As the Internet and on-line services expand from a community of users to a major avenue for commerce, these problems will surely persist, and because of the stakes involved, require some type of resolution.  The courts and Congress will struggle with finding the right balance between the public good that comes from a virtually-unlimited immediately-accessible library of information and the necessity for providing creators of content with a fair economic return and some degree of control over their works.<P>
<LI>Although most infringement takes place at the individual end-user level, the liability of on-line providers and bulletin board operators is a key legal issue because enforcement at the end-user level is currently impractical.  The debate over liability for on-line providers echoes the debate over the liability of videocassette manufacturers which was resolved in favor of the manufacturers in Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), which held that Sony was not liable as a contributory infringer for selling VCRs even though many consumers would use the machines for copying television programs and movies.<P>
<LI>The key legal question is whether on-line providers are liable, either as direct infringers or as contributory infringers, for infringements conducted by subscribers through the on-line services.  Generally, direct copyright infringement is a strict liability offense; a defendant may be found liable as an infringer even though it is not aware of the infringement.  Contributory infringement requires either knowledge of the infringement or supervisory responsibility over the infringer.<P>
<LI>The first decision in the area was Playboy Enter., Inc. v. Frena, 839 F. Supp. 1552 (M.D. Fla. 1993).  Playboy obtained summary judgment for copyright infringement against a bulletin board operator who allowed Playboy photographs to be uploaded, displayed, and downloaded.  The court found direct infringement even though the BBS operator testified that he did not know and had no reason to know of the infringements.<P>
<LI>In Sega Enter. Ltd. v. Maphia, 30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1921 (N.D. Cal. 1994), the game company obtained a preliminary injunction against a BBS operator who encouraged the uploading and downloading of Sega games.  The court found that Sega would likely prove at trial both direct and contributory infringement by the BBS operator.<P>
<LI>While suits by individual companies against small BBS operators may stop some infringement, a wholesale assault on on-line infringement of sound recordings was launched on behalf of the music publishing industry in Frank Music Corp. v. CompuServe, Inc..  This pending class action copyright infringement suit filed on behalf of the music publisher principals of the Harry Fox Agency (which is a central clearinghouse for rights in music other than performance rights) asserts copyright infringement against CompuServe for maintaining a bulletin board--MIDI/Music Forum--in which songs (such as Frank's "Unchained Melody") are uploaded and downloaded.  The forum is one of about 1700 that CompuServe carries but does not run.  It is owned by a third party which warrants against infringement and warns subscribers not to commit copyright violations.<P>
<LI>In July 1994 the NII Task Force Working Group issued its "Green Paper" on copyright law relating to cyberspace. (Its proposals are summarized in the copyright section of the seminar materials.)  The major on-line service providers submitted comments on the Green Paper recommending that they be liable for infringement only if (1) they have actual knowledge that infringing material has been or is being transmitted to, or resides on, their systems, and (2) having knowledge such material is infringing, and the ability and authority to stop its transmission or remove it, fail to stop the transmission or remove it from their systems in a reasonable time.<P>
<LI>As the Green Paper noted, technological means of tracking transactions and licensing may lead to reduced application of the doctrine of fair use. One of the report's proposals is to provide for express criminal liability (limited to a $2,500 fine) for removing or altering copyright management information associated with a digitally encoded work.  The Association of Shareware Professionals has recommended in its comments on the Green Paper that the new legislation provide that the conduct should be treated as equivalent to an infringement of the entire work and also has recommended providing express protection for shareware licenses.<P>
<LI>With so much material going on-line and traditional contracts either not covering such distribution or being ambiguous, authors may sue for breach of contract and copyright infringement when their works are placed by publishers in cyberspace.  In Tasini v. New York Times, 93 Civ. 8678(SS) (S.D.N.Y. 1994), freelance writers sued newspapers, periodicals and electronic publishers for distribution of their articles on-line and in CD-ROMs.<P>
<LI>Since jurisdictional boundaries do not coincide with activity in cyberspace, new jurisdictional and territorial issues are likely to arise.  The Ninth Circuit recently held that mere authorization of extraterritorial acts of infringement is not copyright infringement.  Subafilms, Ltd. v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co., 30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1746 (9th Cir. 1994).  This principle has not been tested in a case involving on-line infringement.
</UL>
<H2>Trademark and Unfair Competition</H2>
<UL>
<LI>In 1990 less than one hundred companies were registered with the Internet's central registry InterNIC.  Today, more than 20,000 are registered.  The Internet domain registration system has spawned a race to acquire commercially valuable names and thwart competitors from using their own names.<P>
<LI>Just as 800 numbers opened up an opportunity for entrepreneurs to control the best numbers and sell them later to companies who needed them, the Internet registration system has led to enterprising companies acquiring famous names for the same purpose (e.g. mcdonalds.com, coke.com, abc.com).<P>
<LI>Direct competitors have used the same technique.  Princeton Review, a major test tutoring company, registered both its name and the name of its main competitor, Stanley Kaplan.  The companies arbitrated the dispute and settled.<P>
<LI>In a widely reported case, a former employee of MTV kept his personal Internet domain name of mtv.com after he left the company and went into business for himself.  MTV sued for trademark infringement and the cyberjockey counterclaimed.  The case is pending.<P>
<LI>Trademarks also are a source of protection for copyright owners whose works are downloaded or displayed without permission.  For example, in Sega v. Macchia, Sega sued for trademark infringement as well as copyright infringement.  The trademark violation was based upon file descriptor headings which used the Sega mark and on the presence of the mark on the games themselves.  Trademark infringement may sometimes permit a more powerful remedy than copyright infringement because treble damages may be available and because attorneys fees may be available for trademark infringement but not for copyright infringement.
</UL>
<H2>Defamation</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Usenet groups and on-line forums permit messages to be sent to millions of readers around the world.  Because these groups and forums promote a culture of free expression and place a premium on pithiness, the possibilities for defamation are rampant.<P>
<LI>Cubby, Inc. v. Compuserve, Inc., 776 F. Supp. 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), established the basic principle that on-line providers should be treated like bookstores, newsstands and libraries, which are not liable for defamation unless they know of the content of the defamatory material.<P>
<LI>In Medphone Corp. v. Denigris, Civ. Action No. 92-3785 (D.N.J. 1992), a medical equipment company sued an investor whose critical remarks on the Prodigy Money Talk bulletin board allegedly caused the stock to tumble.  The case settled.<P>
<LI>A Prodigy user posted the following message about a public stock offering on the Money Talk bulletin board:  "THIS IS FRAUD, FRAUD AND CRIMINAL..."  The company has sued Prodigy and the message writer for $200 million.  Prodigy claims that it should be treated like Compuserve in the Cubby case.  The plaintiff claims Prodigy should be held to a higher standard because it has forum editors and electronically screens for obscenity and hate messages.  The end-user, who formerly worked at Prodigy and who allowed numerous employees to use his account number for internal purposes, denies that he posted the message.<P>
<LI>Just as the provider will ordinarily be insulated from liability for libel, it also will not be liable for the information it makes available.  In Daniel v. Dow Jones & Co., Inc., 520 N.Y.S.2d 334 (Civ. Ct. N.Y. 1987), a New York court held that a publisher of electronic data base is not liable to investor who relied on false information to make losing investment since the subscriber does not have a special relationship with the provider and the First Amendment protects provider.<P>
<LI>Libel law maintains a distinction between public figures and private figures.  Public figures are those who have achieved general fame or notoriety and those who voluntarily inject themselves or are forced into the public eye with respect to a particular subject.  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 351 (1974).  Liability for defamation of a private figure does not require as high a degree of intent as for defamation of a public figure.  One of the grounds for this distinction is that the private figure, unlike the public figure, does not have access to the media to combat the libel.  The existence of the Internet somewhat undermines this distinction since anyone has sufficient access to make any message known to millions at any time.<P>
<LI>In Suarez Corp. v. Meeks, Case No. 267513 (Cuyahoga Cty., Ohio C.P.), a company which relied on Internet E-Mail for direct marketing sued a newsletter publisher who called the program a "scam."  The publisher's defense included the argument that since the plaintiff had distributed its E-mail on the Internet, it should be treated as a public figure, which would require the plaintiff to prove actual malice.  The case reportedly settled for a nominal sum; the plaintiff was unable to prove damages since the publicity from the lawsuit caused sales to soar.<P>
<LI>In September 1994, a fundraiser for Veterans of Foreign Wars state organizations sued for libel in the Southern District of Florida.  The alleged libel started in an article in the Kansas City Star; it was then republished by Datatimes, which makes newspaper articles available on-line for subscribers; a Prodigy subscriber then republished the libel on Prodigy.  The defendants include the newspaper and its reporter, Datatimes, and Prodigy.
</UL>
<H2>Obscenity</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Distribution of sexually explicit and obscene material has proliferated on the Internet, particularly in the distribution of graphic files.  For example, almost 100,000 pornographic photos were found stored on a computer at the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons research lab.<P>
<LI>The prevailing law on obscenity is that it must be judged under local community standards.  Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).  Is this standard obsolete once distribution is electronic and available everywhere?<P>
<LI>In July, 1994, a San Francisco couple that run a BBS called Amateur Action that allows downloading of explicit photographs were convicted of transmitting obscenity through interstate phone lines.  The case was brought by a prosecutor in Memphis, where standards for obscenity under the Miller v. California standard are far stricter than in the Bay Area.  United States v. Thomas, (W.D. Tenn. July 28, 1994).
</UL>
<H2>Federal Law Governing Cyberspace</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
A patchwork of federal laws in addition to intellectual property laws are central to the legal structure of cyberspace.<P>
</DL>
<UL>
<LI>The government in such cases may attempt to rely on traditional criminal laws such as wire fraud to catch bulletin board operators who commit copyright infringement.  In U.S. v. LaMacchia, Case No. 94-10092-RGS (April 4, 1994), an MIT student who operated a not-for-profit BBS which encouraged downloading of copyrighted computer programs, contends that the wire fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 134) which he is charged with violating does not cover on-line copyright infringement.  Although copyright law includes criminal provisions, it does not cover not-for profit infringement.  On December 30, 1994, a federal judge dismissed the indictment.<P>
<LI>Congress has also passed a number of laws specifically governing computer communications.  The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 et seq., passed in 1986, is the basic federal law which prohibits hacking.  Robert Morris, the Cornell student who authored the Internet Worm, was prosecuted under this act.<P>
<LI>The Electronic Communications and Privacy Act (ECPA), 18 U.S.C. § 2510 et seq., outlaws the interception or disclosure of electronic communications.  There are exceptions for on-line providers.  The ECPA does not cover internal company E-mail.<P>
<LI>In 1994, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision in Steve Jackson Games v. United States Secret Service, (W.D. Tex. 1993).  After a bulletin board suspected of harboring hackers was wrongfully raided and the company's e-mail seized, it sued under the ECPA and the Privacy Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000 et seq. ("PPA"), which prohibits seizure of material intended for public dissemination.  After trial, the judge held that the Secret Service violated the ECPA's prohibition on unauthorized disclosure, but did not violate the prohibition on interception because only stored communications were seized.  The court also held that the PPA was violated.<P>
<LI>The Export Control Act prohibits export of encryption software without a license from the State Department under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. § 120 et seq..  Thus, the widespread distribution since 1991 of Phillip Zimmerman's PGP public key encryption software over the Internet to computers outside the U.S. violates this law (and may constitute patent infringement as well since Zimmerman is not the patent owner).<P>
</UL>
In conclusion, the courts have just begun to scratch the legal surface of cyberspace.  1995 will undoubtedly be a year of increasing activity, debate, and guidance.

<H2>Who Owns Your World Wide Web Home Page</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
Businesses are setting up World Wide Web Home Pages at an astronomical rate.  Very often, however, important questions about ownership and other rights in the Home Page are overlooked.  To ensure that your Home Page is an economically valuable asset, it is important to consider ownership and other intellectual property issues at the outset.  By doing so, you will be better able to maximize the value of your new cyberspace storefront.<P>
This article examines general intellectual property issues involved with the adoption, creation and use of World Wide Web Home Pages.  While intellectual property law provides a default answer to many of the questions involved with these issues, you can (and often should) contractually modify these default results.  Accordingly, you should consider consulting with an attorney who is knowledgeable about intellectual property law and conversant in the technology and business aspects of Web sites.  While it is preferable to address these issues before developing your Home Page, if you already have a Home Page many of these issues still should be addressed before a dispute arises.<P>
</DL>
<H2>Who Owns Your Internet Address</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
Your Internet address is the primary method by which others locate and visit your Home Page.  While you may, depending on the situation, generate some traffic due to links from other Web sites, the most important gateway that the rest of the electronic community has to your Home Page is your Internet address.<P>
World Wide Web Home Pages are set up, generally, on a particular node on a domain registered to your company.  While it is unclear whether you have an actual ownership interest in your domain name and Internet address, it can be safely assumed that if a domain name has been assigned and registered to you by the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC), then this domain name may not be given away or used by another party without your permission.  Presumably, you can give permission to use a domain name registered to you in exchange for money, in effect allowing you to "sell" your address.<P>
Notwithstanding InterNIC's ability to assign and register an Internet address to you, another party may be able to prevent you from using a particular domain name under traditional trademark law.  Generally, if your use of a particular domain name would result in a likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of your site or your connection or affiliation with another person or company, your use may be infringing.<P>
For example, while working at MTV, video disk jockey Adam Curry set up an Internet site with the domain name mtv.com, an address which had been assigned to him by InterNIC.  His site offered, among other things, a daily entertainment update.  When Curry left MTV, he kept his Internet service running with the mtv.com address.  MTV promptly sued Curry for, among other things, trademark infringement, claiming that consumers would mistakenly believe that the mtv.com site was offered or authorized by MTV.  Curry agreed not to use the lucrative mtv.com address during the pendency of the lawsuit.  He maintains, however, that even if he loses the infringement suit and is not allowed to use the mtv.com address, he still is the owner of this address and can thereby prevent anyone else, including MTV, from using mtv.com.  Regardless of the outcome of the suit, by using a domain name without assessing the trademark implications, Curry subjected himself not only to considerable legal expenses, but he also had to change his Internet address, causing a loss in the goodwill he had developed in this domain name.<P>
Accordingly, before selecting a domain name and an address for your Home Page, and especially before you invest resources in making others aware of your address, you should conduct a trademark availability search to determine if your address is available from a trademark perspective.  As is evident from the above scenario, you should do this whether the domain name is already registered to you or if you are about to apply for it.  In addition, once you have determined that an address is available for your use, it is vital that you protect your trademark rights in this address.  One method of protecting and strengthening your trademark rights is to seek a federal trademark registration.  Among the many advantages of obtaining a federal registration are the ability to collect attorney's fees if you are successful in a trademark infringement suit and to put others on notice that you consider your domain name to be a protectable trademark, thereby helping to prevent others from adopting similar names.<P>
</DL>
<H2>Other Trademark Issues</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
In addition to your domain name being a trademark, your Home Page is likely to display one or more of your company's trademarks or service marks.  Just as it is important to ensure that your Internet address is available from a trademark perspective, it is also necessary to determine whether any mark you intend to use on your Home Page is available for such use.  For instance, even though your mark may be available for use in your normal trade and advertising channels, that same mark may cause consumer confusion if you use it on a Web Home Page. For that reason, it is important to conduct a trademark availability search.<P>
Similarly, you should act to protect your rights to the marks which you plan to use on your Home Page.  You may wish to consider filing federal trademark or service mark applications for your existing marks and any proposed marks for use in connection with online services or computer networks.<P>
Finally, you should verify that you are using your marks in a manner which best protects your trademark rights.  For example, you should display the appropriate notification next to your mark, namely ? for federally-registered marks, ? for non-federally registered trademarks, and ? for non-federally registered service marks.  Next, you should make sure that your marks are used properly: marks are adjectives, not nouns.  Finally, if you have created a unique product or service, you should work diligently to make sure that the consuming public is able to identify it with a generic name in addition to your mark which is the brand name.  The consequence of not providing the consuming public with a generic name by which to call your product or service could result in your losing all trademark rights to your mark, as has happened in the past to once-valuable marks such as escalator, monopoly and aspirin.<P>
</DL>
<H2>Ownership of Your Home Page</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
Your Home Page has many different aspects, each of which may be owned by a different party.  This is particularly true in light of the fact that most businesses use an outside developer to create their Home Page.  As the business owner, you want to be assured that your Home Page will continue to operate efficiently, can be updated and modified, and will not be copied by your competitors.<P>
There are three separate elements to the ownership of a Home Page:  (1) the content, which refers to the textual, graphical, audio and other material which is displayed on and used by visitors to your Home Page; (2) the look and feel of the interface, namely the screens, organization, patterns, operational control features and the like; and (3) the coding, which refers to the computer instructions which operate the Home Page and which generate the content and the look and feel.<P>
For each of these three elements, you and your developer will need to determine who will have what rights.  There is no correct or best answer to these questions -- the more ownership or exclusivity rights you want, the more you will likely have to pay.  Part of the question of who gets what rights in each of these three elements is determined, at least as a default position, by the source of the material.  The source of materials can be grouped into four categories:  (1) material that is created by you (or an employee of yours); (2) material that is created for you; (3) material which has been purchased or licensed, such as software tools or applications, photographs, clip art or a commercial database; and (4) material in the public domain.  As a general rule, the person creating the material (or the employer of that person) owns all copyright rights to the material, absent a written agreement to the contrary.<P>
A large portion of the material making up your Home Page will likely be material that was created by or for you.  If you, or an employee of yours, creates this material, you will be considered to be the author for copyright purposes.  On the other hand, if an independent contractor, such as an advertising agency or a computer consultant, designs and creates your Home Page, that party will be considered to be the author for copyright purposes.  Absent a written contract assigning you copyright rights to this work, the author will retain control over the work, including rights of distribution, copying and creating further modifications, subject to whatever rights have been licensed to you.<P>
If you and your developer jointly create the material, then you may be considered "joint authors" under copyright law.  Unless there is a written agreement providing otherwise, as joint authors you will each have complete rights to individually exploit the material, subject to a duty to account to the other party for profits.<P>
As you might guess, your rights to any purchased or licensed material will be governed by the contract granting you or the developer the rights to use that material.  If your Home Page was created using purchased or licensed material, or depends on such material, it is imperative that the contract from the owner grant you (either directly or via the developer) adequate rights for a sufficient period of time to allow you to continue using and modifying the material.  Although many tools used to create Home Pages are available as shareware or freeware, and thus are assumed by the software community to be freely available, they are generally still subject to a copyright license.  You should, therefore, carefully review the grant of rights for each piece of shareware and freeware that you (or your developer) use to ensure your rights are sufficient.<P>
Finally, there is material which is freely available, either because it is in the public domain or is available under a "fair use" defense.  This includes any material which (1) is not copyrightable due to insufficient creative expression, (2) has been dedicated to the public domain or (3) constitutes functionally required industry standards.  You should require that the developer warrant that it will use only originally created material, public domain material or duly licensed material, and you should obtain an indemnity agreement for any intellectual property infringement.<P>
In addition, it is important to note that copyright law covers only the expression of ideas and not the ideas themselves.  Therefore, factual information, such as the daily temperature, is freely available for you to put on your Home Page, even if you obtain this information from another news source.  A unique compilation or organization of information, however, may be copyrightable.  Before using any material which you or your developer did not create, you should consult an intellectual property attorney.<P>
For each of these three elements (content, look and feel, and coding), you should carefully consider what rights you want and what rights you are willing to give to your developer.  Depending on your purposes in creating a Home Page, it often will be shortsighted to leave these issues to the default positions provided by copyright law, or, worse yet, to accept the developer's proposal because you are unwilling to invest the resources in obtaining advise on these matters.  Set forth below are some issues that you may wish to consider, although your individual business goals and requirements may lead to different conclusions.<P>
<OL>
<LI>In most cases, the business owner will want to own all the copyright  rights in content of the Home Page.  As the developer will likely be creating some of the content, or at least adapting it from another medium, the development contract should assign all copyright rights in the content from the developer to the business owner.<P>
<LI>While you may wish to have a relatively unique look and feel for your Web site, you may also wish to use some standard features so that users will be able to easily operate and navigate your Home Page.  Furthermore, using standard software packages to create a Home Page greatly reduces development costs.  This often results in Home Pages which have some common features and similarities in their look and feel.  Most likely, you will rely on the developer's expertise and experience to design the look and feel of your Home Page.  While it is not essential that the developer assign you copyright ownership of the look and feel, you should consider requesting at least a perpetual license to use the look and feel in the current version of your Home Page and any future modifications.<P>
<LI>You will have to assess whether you wish to pay the developer an up-front fee for all copyright rights in the look and feel; an up-front fee just for using the look and feel and a separate fee if you wish to make modifications or enhancements to the Home Page which incorporate the look and feel; an arrangement in which you pay a continuing royalty; or some other variation.  Whichever option you choose, you should require that the developer guarantee that it has sufficient rights in all aspects of the look and feel, including those which are created using commercial tools or which incorporate licensed features, so that the developer is able to grant you whatever rights you mutually agree upon.  You also may wish to consider asking the developer for a non-competition agreement.  This agreement could be broad, such as prohibiting the developer from developing Home Pages for competitors in your particular industry, or narrower, such as prohibiting the developer from using the look and feel on any competitors' products.<P>
<LI>Finally, you must address the coding for the Home Page.  The developer will most likely want to be able to use the coding that it creates for you on other projects, and in most instances this will not result in a competitive disadvantage to you.  Furthermore, since it is possible to create a Home Page which looks and operates identical to yours using different coding, it is not absolutely essential that the developer grant you any copyright rights to the coding itself.  In order to more easily facilitate updates or error correction, however, you will likely want to retain some rights in the coding, such as a non-exclusive license to correct errors.  You may also wish to request that the developer place a copy of the coding with a software escrow agent in the event that the developer goes out of business.<P>

<H2><A NAME="intro">INTRODUCTION</A></H2>
<DL>
<DD>The 1994 copyright decisions rendered by the federal courts evidenced the continuing evolvement of copyright law in response to technological changes.  Courts refined their application of traditional copyright principles to subject matters such as computer software and multimedia works.  They also reaffirmed the copyright owner's right to control the dissemination of works in digitized form and clarified the rights of end users to make fair use of another's copyrighted work without permission.<P>

On the Congressional front, there was much talk but no new legislation.  Perhaps the most significant development was the issuance of a "Green Paper" report by the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights on "Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure."  In analyzing the state of current copyright laws in view of new technologies, the report concluded that "the coat was getting a little tight," and while there was no need for a new one, "the old one needs a few alterations."  Some of the changes to the copyright law suggested by the report may find their way into legislation as early as this year.

<DT><B>Commercial Parody May Be Fair Use</B>
<DD>The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's conclusion that 2 Live Crew's rap parody of Roy Orbison's song "Oh, Pretty Woman," was not a fair use.  The Supreme Court emphasized that the fair use doctrine "is not to be simplified with bright-line rules" and reexamined the suggestion in its prior rulings that commercial uses of copyrighted material are presumptively unfair.  The Supreme Court held that a commercial use is simply one factor to be considered that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use.<P>
The Supreme Court also noted that in examining the first fair-use factor--the purpose and character of the use -- "transformative" uses of a work are more likely to be fair uses.  A "transformative" use is one that adds something new to the copied work.  In this case, the 2 Live Crew parody served as a commentary on Roy Orbison's song.  The Supreme Court stated that "the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other facts, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use."  <EM>Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</EM>, 510 U.S. --, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1961 (1994). <P>
<DT><B>Attorneys' Fees: Dual Rule Rejected</B>
<DD>In a copyright action in which the singer/songwriter John Fogerty successfully defended himself against a claim of copyright infringement, the Supreme Court resolved a conflict among the circuits and rejected the "dual rule" for awarding attorneys' fees under the Copyright Act.  Under the "dual rule," a prevailing copyright plaintiff may be awarded attorneys' fees in the discretion of the court, while a prevailing defendant does not receive an award unless the plaintiff's claim was either frivolous or brought in bad faith. <P>
In reaching its decision, the Supreme Court found nothing in the legislative history or the plain language of § 505 of the Copyright Act suggesting that prevailing defendants should be treated differently from prevailing plaintiffs.  It observed that the public interest is best served by encouraging meritorious claims.  While evening the playing field, the Supreme Court declined to adopt Fogerty's argument that fees should be awarded automatically to the winning party, ruling that the award under the statute is clearly discretionary.  <EM>Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.</EM>, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1881 (1994).

<DT><B>Copyright Office's Interpretation of "Cable System" Upheld</B>
<DD>The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's invalidation of the Copyright Office's regulations denying satellite broadcasters status as "cable systems" and the right to obtain compulsory licenses.  The district court based its ruling on an earlier Eleventh Circuit case in which the appellate court held that satellite carriers were "cable systems" for the purposes of the Copyright Act.  Notwithstanding its earlier decision, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the trial court because the Copyright Office's interpretation of the Copyright Act in this instance was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the clear meaning of the statute.  <EM>Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Ass'n of Am. v. Oman</EM>, 17 F3d 344 (11th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Agency Defense Rejected: Infringer May Not Rely On Owner's Investigator</B>
<DD>The Eighth Circuit reversed the granting of summary judgment to the defendant who had reproduced photographs owned by the plaintiff.  The trial court had granted summary judgment on the theory that the plaintiff effectively had licensed the copying by submitting its photographs to the defendants via a private investigator who had signed a standard "hold-harmless" agreement that required him to represent, among other things, that he was the "owner" of the photograph submitted for reproduction.  The Eighth Circuit observed that the agreement had been concocted merely to circumvent liability and that the defendant was well aware of the plaintiff's ownership of the copyright in the photographs based on the copyright notice clearly marked on the photographs and the plaintiff's prior warnings to the defendant.  <EM>Olan Mills Inc. v. Linn Photo Co.</EM>, 23 F.3d 1345 (8th Cir. 1994) <P>
<DT><B>Fair Use In Copying Lobbyist's List</B>
<DD>The Sixth Circuit affirmed a trial court's grant of summary judgment for the defendant that had copied a list compiled by the plaintiff.  The list consisted of state legislators' names with asterisks next to the names the plaintiff deemed important.  The Sixth Circuit agreed with the trial court's conclusion that the defendant's use of plaintiff's list was a fair use.  The Sixth Circuit noted that the most important element of fair use analysis, effect upon the potential market for the original, weighed in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff's "market" (i.e. its ability to retain members) was not harmed, and perhaps even enhanced, by the defendant's dissemination of the list.  <EM>National Rifle Ass'n of America v. Handgun Control Fed'n of Ohio</EM>, 15 F.3d 559 (6th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Copying for Internal Purposes Not Fair Use</B>
<DD>The Second Circuit affirmed a district court's ruling that Texaco's practice of photocopying articles from scientific journals archived in its library for use by its researchers did not amount to a fair use.  The court analyzed the four statutory factors and concluded that (1) the first factor--the purpose and character of the use--weighed against Texaco because the dominant purpose of the use was to assemble a set of papers for future reference, "thereby serving the same purpose for which additional subscriptions are normally sold, or . . . for which photocopying licenses may be obtained"; (2) the second factor--the nature of the copyrighted work--weighed in Texaco's favor because the content of the articles was predominantly factual in nature; (3) the third factor--the amount and substantiality of the portion used--weighed against Texaco because Texaco copied the entire works; and (4) the fourth factor--the effect upon the potential market for or value of the work--weighed against Texaco because, although without the copying Texaco would have increased the number of its journal subscriptions only somewhat, the lost potential licensing revenue from "traditional, reasonable, or likely developed markets" was significant.  <EM>American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.</EM>, 37 F.3d 881 (2d Cir.), reh'g denied, amended, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 36735 (2nd Cir. Dec. 23, 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Infringement</B>
<DL>
<DT><B>Computer Programs:  Altai Test Adopted by Fifth Circuit</B>
<DD>The Fifth Circuit applied the "abstraction--filtration-comparison" test formulated by the Second Circuit in <EM>Computer Associates Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.</EM>, 982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1992) to a claim of infringement of the plaintiff's copyrighted software.  In doing so, the court reversed the district court's finding that the plaintiff's input and output formats for its computer program were unprotectable as non-literal ideas.  <EM>Engineering Dynamics v. Structural Software</EM>, 26 F.3d 1335 (5th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Derivative Works</B>
<DD>The First Circuit affirmed the district court's decision that the plaintiff could recover statutory damages for the defendant's copying and renting of an unregistered derivative work where the underlying work was registered.  The plaintiff held an exclusive license to distribute a Cambodian-language version of a Chinese-language soap opera.  Consequently, two works were at issue, the original registered version in Chinese and the unregistered derivative work which was the original dubbed in Cambodian.  The First Circuit held that under the license the plaintiff had the exclusive right to use the original video images in the underlying work in concert with a Cambodian soundtrack and that therefore it could maintain a lawsuit for infringement of that portion of the derivative work that was part of the underlying work.  The First Circuit stated that it was irrelevant that what was actually distributed by the plaintiff was a derivative work.  In addition, the First Circuit held that because four episodes of the soap opera were at issue, the trial court erred by granting statutory damages for only one work, so that the plaintiff was entitled to statutory damages for the infringement of four works.  <EM>Gamma Audio and Video, Inc. v. Ean-Chea</EM>, 11 F.3d 1106 (1st Cir. 1993). <P>
<DT><B>Extraterritoriality: Authorizing Copying Abroad is Not Infringement</B>
<DD>On a petition for rehearing en banc, the Ninth Circuit overruled its earlier decision in <EM>Peter Starr Prod. Co. v. Twin Continental Films</EM>, 783 F.2d 1440 (9th Cir. 1986), and ruled that the mere authorization in the United States to commit an infringing act occurring entirely abroad does not constitute copyright infringement.  According to the court, the use of the phrase "to authorize" in section 106 of the Copyright Act does not create a separate category of liability unrelated to the lawfulness of the authorized act.  It also reaffirmed the principle that United States courts lack jurisdiction over wholly extraterritorial acts of infringement.  Therefore, the defendants' acts of authorizing the making and selling abroad of videocassette copies of the plaintiffs' copyrighted film, even though they were not within the defendants' license to grant, were not actionable; the infringing acts of making and selling the videocassettes did not occur in the United States and therefore could not be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States' courts under the Copyright Act.  <EM>Subafilms, Ltd. v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co.</EM>, 24 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>"Inverse Ratio" Rule Rejected by Eleventh Circuit</B>
<DD>The Eleventh Circuit rejected the use of the so-called "inverse ratio" rule adopted by some courts.  The court determined that the rule, which permits an inference of copying without the amount of proof required to show substantial similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's works if there is clear and convincing evidence of the defendant's access to the plaintiff's work, had never been adopted in the Eleventh Circuit so that the presence of access would not dispose of the requirement to prove substantial similarity.  <EM>Beal v. Paramount Pictures Corp.</EM>, 20 F.3d 454 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 1994 U.S. LEXIS 3460 (1994). <P>
<DT><B>Willful Infringement Found Where Infringer Ignored Notices</B>
<DD>The Seventh Circuit outlined several factors that courts may consider in determining whether the defendant's infringing acts were "willful."  Among these factors are whether the defendant ignored notices from the plaintiff that the defendant's acts were unlawful, whether the defendant sought legal advice, and whether the defendant treated the matter as a nuisance.  The court held that the defendant's failure to contact the copyright owner demonstrated willfulness where the defendant ignored a notice from the U.S. Customs Service stating that the allegedly infringing copies of the copyright owner's work being imported by the defendant had been impounded.  <EM>Wildlife Express Corp. v. Carol Wright Sales, Inc.</EM>, 18 F.3d 502 (7th Cir. 1994). <P>
</DL>
<DT><B>Jurisdiction:Songwriter's Contacts with Texas Insufficient for Personal Jurisdiction</B>
<DD>The Fifth Circuit held that, in a declaratory judgment action to determine ownership of the copyright in a song, the relevant activities for determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is appropriate are circumscribed.  The court concluded that the activities of the nonresident defendant--who claimed that the plaintiff's song infringed the copyright in his song--in distributing and publicly performing his own song nationwide and mailing a demand letter to the plaintiff in Texas were insufficient contacts to subject him to jurisdiction in Texas.  The court noted that its analysis might have been different in an action where the claim was one of infringement by the defendant's song.  <EM>Ham v. La Cienega Music Co.</EM>, 4 F.3d 413 (5th Cir. 1993). <P>
<DT><B>Ownership</B>
<DL>
<DT><B>Works Made for Hire</B>
<DD>In giving further definition to what constitutes a work created by an employee within the scope of his or her employment for purposes of treating it as a "work made for hire," the Fourth Circuit overturned the district court's conclusion that the use to which the employer was going to put the work was a relevant factor.  The appellate court observed that a work is created within the scope of his or her employment if the work is of the kind the employee is employed to create, is created substantially within the authorized time and space limitations set by the employer and is created at least in part for the purpose of serving the employer.  In the case before it, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the fact that the software created by the employee was created at home and for demonstration purposes rather than a commercial product was not important where the employee is at least appreciably motivated by a desire to further the employer's goals.  <EM>Avtec Systems, Inc. v. Peiffer</EM>, 21 F.3d 568 (4th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Registration of Later Ratified Assignment Valid</B>
<DD>Following the lead of the Ninth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit made clear that the validity of a copyright registration does not necessarily turn on when a written transfer of the copyright is made.  The court of appeals disagreed with the district court's conclusion that because the plaintiff's predecessor had only an oral assignment in the copyright at the time he registered it, the registration was ineffective and thus the plaintiff was barred from bringing a lawsuit.  Noting that a valid oral contract existed with regard to the assignment of the copyright before it was registered, the Eleventh Circuit held that an oral assignment of a copyright ratified after the fact or confirmed by a written memorandum satisfied the writing requirement of the Copyright Act.  Therefore, even though the writing did not exist at the time of registration, the registration was valid because the transfer was later confirmed in writing.  Consequently, the plaintiff did have the right to bring a lawsuit to protect its copyright.  <EM>Arthur Rutenberg Homes v. Drew Homes, Inc.</EM>, 29 F.3d 1529 (11th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Actors Not Joint Authors of Play</B>
<DD>For the first time, the Seventh Circuit addressed the test to be used in determining whether a "joint work" is created within the meaning of § 101 of the Copyright Act.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed a district court's grant of an injunction preventing the defendant from performing the plaintiff's plays and from using a videotape of the plaintiff's plays.  The district court held that although some of the actors in the plaintiff's plays had collaborated in creating the script, the actors' contribution was not enough for them to make them joint authors.  Following the test used by the Second Circuit in <EM>Childress v. Taylor</EM>, 945 F.2d 500 (2d Cir. 1991), the Seventh Circuit held that in order for a work to be a "joint work" under § 101, the authors must mutually intend to create a joint work and each author's contribution must be separately copyrightable.  <EM>Erickson v. Trinity Theatre</EM>, 13 F.3d 1061 (7th Cir. 1994). <P>
</DL>
<DT><B>Preemption:Antipiracy Statutes Not Preempted by Copyright</B>
<DD>The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's rejection of a petitioner's argument that California's antipiracy law was preempted by the Copyright Act.  The Ninth Circuit noted that the purpose of the California law was broader than that of the federal copyright laws and included protecting the public from being victimized by false and deceptive commercial practices and criminalizing the selling of recordings whose labels do not disclose the manufacturer or author.  <EM>Anderson v. Nidorf</EM>, 26 F.3d 100 (9th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Remedies</B>
<DL>
<DT><B>Taxes Deductible in Calculating Non-Willful Infringer's Profits</B>
<DD>The Second Circuit reversed a trial court's ruling that income taxes paid on profits may not be deducted in determining an award of profits under the Copyright Act.  The Second Circuit held that, at least where the defendant's infringing acts are not willful, a claim for infringing profits means profits actually made.  A defendant's income tax expense is therefore deductible overhead in appropriate cases when calculating an award of profits.  In <EM>Design v. K-Mart Apparel Corp.</EM>, 13 F.3d 559 (2d Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Evidence of Limited Profit from Photo in Magazine Admissible</B>
<DD>The Fourth Circuit affirmed a trial court's decision to allow the defendant to introduce evidence regarding its profits.  The trial court had allowed the defendant, which had published a photograph in its magazine taken by the plaintiff without his permission, to categorize its revenues and to present testimony that demonstrated that the bulk of this revenue would have been earned even absent its infringement of the plaintiff's work.  The plaintiff complained that the jury should have only been exposed to the total amount of revenue generated by the defendant's magazine.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed the trial court's breakdown of the revenues into categories as supporting an accurate finding of the profits earned by defendant actually attributable to its publication of the plaintiff's photograph.  <EM>Walker v. Forbes, Inc.</EM>, 28 F.3d 409 (4th Cir. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Enjoined Party Entitled to Execute on Bond for Wrongful Injunction</B>
<DD>The Ninth Circuit held that a party enjoined under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) is usually entitled to execute on the bond posted by the plaintiff for damages resulting from the injunction where it turns out the party enjoined had the right all along to do what it was enjoined from doing.  The fact that the party seeking the injunction acted in good faith is not a defense to a claim of wrongful injunction.  <EM>Nintendo of America, Inc. v. Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.</EM>, 16 F.3d 1032, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1857 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 85 (1994). <P>
</DL>
<DT><B>Seizures: Seizure Remedy Excludes Non-Infringing Business Records</B>
<DD>The Sixth Circuit held that the district court abused its discretion by issuing an ex parte seizure order that allowed the plaintiff to seize not only software that allegedly infringed its copyrights, but also the defendant's business records.  The court determined that section 503(a) of the Copyright Act only allows the impoundment of goods that infringe the plaintiff's copyrights and articles that can be used to copy those infringing goods.  Since the business records did not fall within either of these categories, the court ruled that the order authorizing their seizure was improper.  The court also noted that the Supreme Court's Copyright Rules relating to seizure and impoundment promulgated under the 1909 Copyright Act and purportedly in effect today had no applicability since the order itself was not authorized.  Further more, the order could not be justified under Fed. R. Civ. 65(b) because that rule only permits ex parte restraining order intended to preserve the status quo until a hearing can be held, and the search of business records went beyond preserving the status quo.  <EM>First Technology Safety Systems v. Depinet</EM>, 11 F.3d 641 (6th Cir. 1993). <P>
<DT><B>Transfers: Statute of Frauds Not Satisfied by Post Expiration Signature</B>
<DD>The Ninth Circuit held that a letter, purportedly confirming the existence of an exclusive copyright license to the plaintiffs, did not satisfy the "in writing" requirement of section 204(a) of the Copyright Act.  The Ninth Circuit noted that the letter was not signed until a year and a half after the expiration of the term of the alleged license, and held that in order for it to serve its function as the basis for each party's rights, it must be executed at close to the same time the agreement is made and also be a product of the parties' negotiations.  <EM>Konigsberg Int'l v. Rice</EM>, 16 F.3d 355, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1789 (9th Cir. 1994). <P>

<DT><B>BBS Operator Liable for Infringement</B>
<DD>The district court found that the operators of a computer bulletin board upon which unauthorized copies of the plaintiff's computer games were uploaded and downloaded by unknown users was liable for copyright infringement.  The court found that the uploading of the games was done with the operators' knowledge and that the downloading of the games by users to make additional copies was facilitated and encouraged by the bulletin board operator.  The court further concluded that, even if the defendants did not know exactly when games would be uploaded or downloaded, their role in providing the bulletin board facilities, direction, knowledge and encouragement amounted to contributory copyright infringement.  <EM>Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. MAPHIA</EM>, 857 F. Supp. 679 (N.D. Cal. 1994). <P>
In a similar action, the district court in Minnesota issued a preliminary injunction against the operator of a bulletin board which contained unauthorized copies of plaintiff's application software.  <EM>Microsoft Corp. v. Chung, F. Supp.</EM> (D. Minn. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Synchronization Rights Not Applied to Televised Performance</B>
<DD>The district court held that the defendant's use of the plaintiff's sound recording did not infringe the plaintiff's copyright in the recording.  The defendant used the sound recording on a television show which was broadcast on over one hundred television stations across the country.  The plaintiff argued that he was entitled to synchronization rights under § 114(b) of the Copyright Act.  After examining the legislative history of § 114, the trial court disagreed, finding that the plaintiff's rights in the sound recording "could only be infringed by the unauthorized sale or public distribution of video tapes, audio cassettes or compact discs containing his sound recordings to the general public . . . ." (Emphasis in the original).  The trial court also ruled that the defendant's use of the sound recording did not constitute a derivative work and that the defendant's use actually constituted a "performance" of the recording which, because § 114(b) does not confer performance rights upon the copyright holder, did not infringe the plaintiff's copyright.  Finally, the court found the defendant's broadcast of the work was protected under the "ephemeral recording" exception contained in § 112 of the Copyright Act, which allows certain "transmitting organizations" to make a single copy of a work under certain circumstances.  <EM>Agee v. Paramount Communications</EM>, 853 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Vicarious Liability Not Imposed on Trade Show Organizer</B>
<DD>In denying the plaintiffs' claim for vicarious liability against the organizers of a computer trade show for music performed there, the district court concluded, in a trial on stipulated facts, that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a case for direct infringement.  The court concluded that it was the plaintiff's burden to show that the performers of the music did not have authorization to perform it before liability could be imposed vicariously on the show's organizers.  In reaching this conclusion, the court acknowledged that its decision was in conflict with a number of other courts that have imposed vicarious liability without an explicit finding that the alleged direct infringers were not authorized to perform the music.  <EM>Polygram Int'l Publishing, Inc. v. Nevada/TIG, Inc.</EM>, 855 F. Supp. 1314 (D. Mass. 1994). <P>
<DT><B>Seizures: Supreme Court Copyright Rules Not Followed</B>
<DD>The district court refused to grant the plaintiffs an ex parte order to impound the defendant's allegedly infringing videocassettes.  The court stated that it is given the authority under § 503(a) of the Copyright Act to order the seizure of all copies of a plaintiff's work and the instrumentalities to make such copies.  It also noted that such orders are not mandatory.  The plaintiffs argued that they met the requirements of the Rules of Practice adopted by the United States Supreme Court pursuant to rulemaking power conferred on the Court by the Copyright Act ("Copyright Rules") and that, therefore, their seizure order was adequate to protect the defendants' rights.  The district court noted that the Copyright Rules are inconsistent with the discretion afforded courts under § 503(a) and are of "dubious constitutional validity" in light of the Supreme Court's subsequent decisions regarding seizures.  Consequently, in denying the order, the district court held that the plaintiffs' order did not comply with the Court's later decisions and did not sufficiently support the plaintiffs' claim that a seizure order was necessary.  In addition, the district court ruled that the order violated the defendants' Fourth Amendment rights because it did not specify with requisite particularity the premises to be searched or the articles to be seized.  <EM>Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Doe</EM>, 821 F. Supp. 82 (E.D.N.Y. 1993). <P>
<DT><B>Transfers: First Sale Doctrine Not Applied to Program License</B>
<DD>The district court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from selling MS-DOS and Windows.  The defendants claimed that the Copyright Act's "first sale doctrine" permitted their sales because they had purchased the programs from authorized licensees of Microsoft.  The court found, however, that the defendants had failed to sustain their burden of tracing the chain of title to the products to a first sale by Microsoft.  Microsoft had presented evidence that it was its practice to grant a license to use those products, but not to transfer actual ownership.  Such a license, the court concluded, is not a "sale" for purposes of the first sale doctrine.  Accordingly, defendants' sales, which also were not authorized under the terms of the license agreement which prohibited the sale of stand-alone products, infringed Microsoft's copyrights.  <EM>Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers & Elecs., Inc.</EM>, 846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y. 1994).

<H2><A NAME="proposed">PROPOSED LEGISLATION:</A></H2>
<DL>
<H3>PROPOSED CHANGES TO COPYRIGHT LAWS BY INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY TASK FORCE</H3>
<DD>A group headed by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Bruce Lehman has issued a report recommending certain changes to the current copyright laws in light of the proposed national information superhighway.  The report, which was issued last July as part of the work of the Information Infrastructure Task Force appointed by President Clinton, concludes that the information superhighway has the potential to increase access to information and entertainment resources greatly.  It observes, however, that the potential of the information superhighway will not be realized fully if these resources are not protected effectively when disseminated. <P>
In particular, the report notes that, today, nearly any work can be "digitized," i.e., translated into binary code, and can then be stored, transmitted and used in that format.  It cautions that, with the advent of a national, high-speed, high-capacity electronic information system, one individual could, with a few key strokes, deliver perfect copies of digitized works to scores of individuals. <P>
The report focuses its discussion on whether the current copyright laws need to be changed in view of digital technology.  In addition, the report more generally addresses the application of the copyright laws to multimedia works. <P>
The report takes the position that, with the proliferation of works in an environment in which they all appear as digital bits so that they cannot easily fit into any of the eight enumerated types of works set forth in the Copyright Act, it may be time to eliminate such classifications altogether.  The report also recognizes that developing a multimedia work often requires licensing rights from numerous sources--for text, images, film clips, narration, and music--and that identifying the owners of the copyrights in these different works can be difficult.  Despite this difficulty, the report rejects the notion that any national compulsory license system should be implemented.  Rather, the report favors allowing the marketplace to develop appropriate licensing schemes. <P>
After reviewing existing intellectual property protection and after evaluating how new technology and educational efforts could enhance protection for copyrighted works, however, the authors of the report do conclude that the Copyright Act should be altered in several areas. <P>
<H3>DISTRIBUTION BY TRANSMISSION</H3>
<DL>
<DD>The report recognizes that one of the major effects of high-speed digital communications will be its utilization as a means both to distribute the work itself and to distribute copies of the work.  In view of this fact, the report recommends the following specific changes to the Copyright Act: <P>
Exclusive right to transmit.  The report suggests that because, in the world of the information superhighway, a preferred means of distribution from one location to another may be via transmission, the Copyright Act should be amended explicitly to include distribution by transmission as one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder. <P>
Reproductions may be transmitted.  The report notes that the Copyright Act currently contemplates a transmission only of a performance or a display of a work.  Since a reproduction of a work also may be transmitted, the report recommends that the definition of "transmit" be modified to reflect this fact.  Where the transmission may result in both a copy being distributed and the communication of a performance or display, the "primary purpose or effect" test should be used to determine which result predominates. <P>
Importation by transmission.  Recognizing that copies of works can be introduced into the United States via transmission, the report suggests that the ban on unauthorized importation of works acquired outside the United States be revised explicitly to prohibit importation of works "whether by carriage of tangible goods or by transmission." <P>
Publication by transmission.  Consistent with its other recommendations, the report suggests that the definition of "publication" in the Copyright Act include distribution of copies or phonorecords by transmission. <P>
Limitation on the first sale doctrine.  With certain exceptions, the Copyright Act currently allows the owner of a particular, lawfully-made copy of a work to dispose of it in any manner without infringing the copyright owner's exclusive right of distribution.  The report recommends, however, that this first sale doctrine not apply to distributions by transmission, because a transmission may involve both the reproduction of the work and the distribution of the reproduction. <P>
</DL>
<H3>RESTRICTING TECHNOLOGY THAT DEFEATS COPYRIGHT PROTECTION SYSTEMS</H3>
<DL>
<DD>The report adopts the widely-held view that the digitized works that will be utilized on the information superhighway may be easily copied and that such copying may be difficult to detect.  Because these problems make traditional copyright enforcement through infringement actions difficult, the report contemplates that copyright owners will look to technological protection mechanisms and systems, as well as the law, to inhibit copying.  To encourage reliance on such mechanisms and systems, the report recommends that the Copyright Act be amended in a number of respects to prohibit the importation, manufacture, and distribution of devices and services that defeat anti-copying systems. <P>
</DL>
<H3>PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF COPYRIGHT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION</H3>
<DL>
<DD>The report recognizes that certain information associated with a work--such as the name of the copyright owner and the terms and conditions for using it--may be essential for works to appear and be utilized efficiently and successfully on the information superhighway.  Accordingly, the report recommends that the Copyright Act be amended to prohibit fraudulent inclusion or removal of such information, with fines of up to $2,500. <P>
</DL>
<H3>PUBLIC PERFORMANCE RIGHT FOR SOUND RECORDINGS</H3>
<DL>
<DD>The report notes that direct digital transmissions of sound recordings may soon supplant current forms of distributing phonorecords via cassette or compact disc.  It also observes that some of these transmissions will constitute public performances of the sound recordings, rather than copies, and may become a preferred alternative to buying copies for listening. <P>
Under current law, sound recordings are the only works whose copyright does not include the exclusive right to perform the work publicly.  Therefore, to play a record on the radio, the radio station need only obtain a license from the copyright holder of the work that was recorded, but not from the owner of the copyright in the recording itself.  The report recommends that this anomaly be rectified. <P>
The report supports two bills introduced in Congress this past session that would grant a limited performance right in sound recordings.  Under these bills, the rights afforded the copyright holder in a sound recording would be expanded to include performance of the recording by "digital transmission."  It would not, however, extend to live public performances such as at a club, or to analog transmissions received over the radio.  (At this time, neither bill has made it out of committee.) <P>
While the report represents the author's preliminary examination and analysis of copyright law and its application and effectiveness in the context of the information superhighway, it is likely that its recommendations will be proposed formally into legislation sometime next year.  Public comment on the report closed on September 28, 1994.  Comments are available for public inspection at the Scientific and Technical Information Center of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Room 2C07, Crystal Plaza 34, 2021 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<H2>InterNIC Issues New Trademark Policy for Domain Names</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Gary S. Weinstein</h4>
<p>

Domain names, such as faegre.com, are the electronic addresses of computers on the Internet.  Much like novelty telephone numbers, domain names are assigned on a first-come-first-serve basis by a non-profit organization called InterNIC.  In the past, this led to problems such as The Princeton Review surprising its major competitor Stanley Kaplan by reserving the domain name kaplan.com, or companies such as McDonalds learning that in order to obtain the domain name mcdonalds.com, it would have to pay a ransom to the party who had registered that domain name.<p>

To deal with such problems, InterNIC recently instituted a new policy related to the trademark implications of domain names.  First, when applying for a domain name, an applicant is required to warrant that (i) its use of the domain name will not result in trademark infringement, (ii) it has a bona fide intention to use the domain name on a regular basis, and (iii) it is not seeking to use the domain name for any unlawful purpose.  Furthermore, the applicant must agree to indemnify InterNIC and its affiliated organizations for any claims relating to the use of the domain name. <p> 

Second, if at any time another party claims that it owns the trademark rights to a domain name by submitting to InterNIC a valid United States Trademark Registration (or a foreign equivalent) with a filing date or date-of-first-use prior to the first use of the domain name, then the domain name registrant will have thirty days to submit proof that it also has valid trademark rights in that name.  Satisfactory proof would include a certified copy of a United States Trademark Registration (or a foreign equivalent) or a court order supporting the claimed rights.  Furthermore, the domain name registrant must also indemnify InterNIC from any costs InterNIC might incur relating to the dispute and post a bond to cover any possible damages.  <p>

If the domain name registrant submits sat-isfactory proof that it owns trademark rights in the domain name, agrees to hold InterNIC harmless and posts a bond to cover any possible damages, it can continue to use the domain name until the dispute is resolved or a court grants a temporary order ruling otherwise.  If the domain name registrant fails to meet these three requirements and chooses not to adopt a new domain name, then InterNIC will suspend the domain name until the dispute is resolved or a court grants a temporary order.  If the domain name registrant does choose to adopt a new domain name, then InterNIC will allow the domain name registrant to use the old and new domain names simultaneously for ninety days.  Regardless of whether the domain name is suspended, InterNIC itself will not become involved in the dispute.  The parties will have to resolve the dispute either through arbitration or in court.  <p>

While there are questions relating to this new policy and whether it could withstand a legal challenge, unless you have a United States Trademark Registration (or foreign equivalent) for your domain name, InterNIC can suspend your electronic address with only thirty days advance notice.  The prudent course for any business that has developed goodwill in a domain name is to apply for a United States Trademark Registration that covers the domain name.  Even if you have a trademark registration, you still will have to defend your rights to use the domain name, if challenged.  The risks of losing the domain name during the pendency of the dispute, however, are likely to be significantly reduced.<P>

<H2>Patenting a Floppy Disk: Availability of Software Patents Increase</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Daniel A. Tysver</h4>
<p>


<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>here is currently greater opportunity than ever before for software developers to obtain patent protection for their computer programs.  Both the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the appeals court with authority over all patent appeals, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have recently taken action to expand the scope of patent protection available for computer software.<P>

In a series of rulings, the Federal Circuit discussed the scope of the U.S. patent laws.  Under the U.S. Patent laws, patents may be granted on any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter.  Historically, computer software was considered to be a mathematical algorithm, and not a process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter within the meaning of the patent laws.  As such, computer software programs could not be patented alone, as the programs were not statutory subject matter.  Instead, in order to obtain a patent for software, the software had to be patented in connection with some external machine, such as part of a computer modem, or as part of a separate process, such as a process for curing rubber.  <P>

In a recent holding, however, the Federal Circuit found computer software to be patentable even where the external machine was comprised of only simple digital electronic circuits, namely a barrel shifter and an arithmetic logic unit.  In a second decision, the Court allowed a patent for software where the external component was only a generic machine with computer memory on which the software was stored.  These rulings indicate that software patent applications written to include a reference to the computer on which the software is executed, or a reference to the computer memory on which the software is stored, can be patentable.<P>

While at first the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office resisted the Federal Circuit's expansion of statutory subject matter, the Office has reconsidered its position and has now announced new examination guidelines for evaluating the patentability of computer related inventions.  The guidelines state explicitly that computer programs embodied in a tangible medium, such as a floppy diskette, are patentable subject matter . . . .  Rather than focusing on whether the invention is considered statutory subject matter, the guidelines instruct the patent examiners to focus on the novelty of the invention itself.  <P>
		
Under these guidelines, a computer software will be considered patentable simply by including a reference to a tangible medium.  Since software is always stored in some medium, whether it be a floppy disk, random access memory (RAM) or a CD-ROM, every software program should now be considered to be statutory subject matter.  Of course, software must still meet the other criteria of patentability, including novelty, utility and nonobviousness.<P>

Although computer software is already protected by copyright law, the possibility of seeking patent protection for computer software should be seriously considered by all software developers in light of these new developments.  While copyright law protects software against the copying of all or a portion of the software, it offers no protection against the independent development of similar software, i.e., software that is created without copying.  In contrast, patent protection prevents anyone from making, using, or selling the patented product, even if the infringing product was independently developed.  Also, patent law is designed to protect innovative ideas and can cover such things as the program logic and particular functions in the software.  Copyright law, however, protects only against the copying of a particular expression of an idea and not against copying of the underlying concepts embedded in the software.  <P>

Patent law contains strict requirements regarding the timely filing of applications; patent rights can be lost if an application is not filed in time.  As a result, software developers desiring patent protection should take steps to have a patent applicantion filed as soon as possible after the invention has been made.  <P>

<H2>Employee Benefits and Executive Compensation</H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
<H4>Overview of Our Practice</H4>
<P>
Faegre &amp; Benson has one of the nation's larger groups of lawyers specializing in the law of employee benefits and executive compensation.  Our size and the diversity of our experience derived from a large client base enable us to respond to the needs of a broad range of clients.  Although we primarily represent employers, we also have extensive experience in working with providers of financial products and services such as bank trust departments, insurance companies, and brokerage firms.
<P>



Because of the many applicable laws and regulations, we are involved in most aspects of benefit and compensation planning.  We assist clients with strategic planning, including developing plan specifications, initial plan design, and seeking legislative and regulatory solutions to clients' problems.  We prepare plan documents, summary plan descriptions, and other employee communications.  We counsel clients regarding the implementation and ongoing administration of benefit programs.  
<P>


Our lawyers are experienced in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, both in obtaining approvals of plans and transactions and in handling other tax and regulatory matters.  In addition, we deal regularly with issues involving employee benefits that arise under the securities laws, federal and state discrimination laws, state insurance laws, and federal and state wage-hour laws.
<P>


Our Washington D.C. office provides us with a unique capacity to assist clients on complicated employee benefits issues.  The staff in that office has a strong background on legislative and regulatory matters involving employee benefits.  They are acquainted with the key Congressional and agency personnel who deal with employee benefits.
<P>


Lawyers in our Employee Benefits Group and lawyers in our Litigation Group also have experience in ERISA and other types of litigation involving employee benefit plans.

<h4>Paul S. Moe</h4>

<font="+2"><b>Introduction</b></font>
<br>

The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated nearly 200 pages of new regulations related to asbestos-containing materials (ACM).<STRONG>1</STRONG>  Many of the far reaching provisions of the regulations will be effective October 1, 1995.<STRONG>2</STRONG>  The regulations will have a significant effect on several industries, including construction firms, asbestos abatement contractors, and shipbuilding interests.  In addition, many businesses with real estate holdings (that may not previously have been subject to OSHA requirements) must take steps to protect employees from certain asbestos risks, and must disclose asbestos-related information to employees, building managers, tenants, and successive property owners.<p>

<font="+2"><b>Background</b></font>
<br>

Asbestos is a common mineral that was widely used in the United States until the 1970s for a variety of commercial purposes, including fireproofing, vinyl floor tiles, textured paints, ceiling and acoustical tiles, pipe insulation, furnaces, walls, boilers and brake linings.  Since asbestos is processed into microscopic fibers that can remain airborne for long periods of time, it can be difficult to contain the fibers once they have been released.  According to OSHA, asbestos levels in a building can become hazardous if concentrated amounts of fibers are released into the building air as a result of any disturbance of the ACM in the building.   OSHA has identified certain studies that purport to show a link between exposure to significant amounts of asbestos and asbestosis (a disease with symptoms similar to emphysema), lung cancer, and cancer of the chest lining or abdominal cavity.  The risk of health problems caused by merely working in an office building with ACM, however, has been described as minimal.  Researchers have asserted that the likelihood of death from exposure to asbestos in a commercial building is as probable as death from a shark attack or the bubonic plague.<STRONG>3</STRONG>  The risk to building occupants from asbestos contained in the building has been compared to smoking one-half of a cigarette in a lifetime.<STRONG>4</STRONG> Although the risk to building  occupants  may be  minimal, OSHA concluded that it should take action to limit repeated exposure to asbestos by (among others) maintenance and custodial employees. 
<br> 

In response to its concerns about the health risks for employees who work directly with asbestos or ACM,  beginning in 1974  OSHA enacted regulations that protected workers in two distinct areas.  OSHA established a construction industry standard for activities related to direct contact with asbestos, and a general industry standard that covered all activities involving contact with ACM that were not otherwise covered by the construction standard.  In connection with these two standards, OSHA established extensive requirements for working with asbestos.  OSHA established permissible exposure limits (PELs), which serve as a benchmark for the maximum permitted exposure to airborne asbestos fibers that a worker can have in an eight-hour day.  The construction standard included very detailed techniques for asbestos abatement and demolition work.  
<p>
<font="+2"><b>OSHA's New Requirements</b></font>
<br>

The new regulations greatly extend the reach of OSHA's jurisdiction, and include the following new requirements:
<p>
<font="+2"><b>Duties of "Building/ Facility Owners"</b></font>
<br>

Based on the premise that "building/facility owners " (as defined below) are often "the only and/or the best source of information concerning the presence of ACM,"<STRONG>5</STRONG>  OSHA imposed broad new obligations on commercial and industrial property owners.  OSHA defined  building/facility owner as the legal entity, including a lessee, which exercises control over management and record keeping functions."<STRONG>6</STRONG> This broad definition includes many property owners or lessees that have no employees, or who otherwise have not considered themselves to be under OSHA's jurisdiction.  The new regulations require building/facility owners to disclose to their own employees (if they have any) and to employers of employees who may be exposed to asbestos, the existence of ACM and "presumed asbestos containing materials" (PACM)<STRONG>7</STRONG> in the building or facility, as identified by an industrial hygienist.  (Building/facility owners are exempt from this requirement if the building was constructed after 1979, or if qualified analysts have determined that the building is free of asbestos.)  Once notified of the existence of the ACM and PACM, the employer of the housekeeping staff - if different from the building/facility owner - must promptly satisfy the disclosure obligations it has to such employees.  Since the regulations require disclosure of PACM, as well as ACM, all building/facility owners must at least conduct visual surveys to identify all ACM and PACM on the property.
<p>
<font="+2"><b>Notification of Employees</b></font>
<br>

Employers must develop and implement a rigorous training program for all employees who may be exposed to airborne concentration limits above the PELs.  This program must explain, among other matters, the health effects associated with asbestos exposure, procedures implemented to protect employees from exposure to asbestos, the use of respirators and protective clothing, and a description of the medical surveillance program required by OSHA.  Training must be provided at least annually to each such employee.  Employers must also post warning signs in and around areas where airborne concentrations of asbestos exceed (or where there is a reasonable possibility they may exceed) the PELs.
<br>

Employers must also provide an "asbestos awareness training course" for all employees who do housekeeping or custodial work in facilities where ACM or  (PACM) are present.  This course must describe the health effects of asbestos, the location of ACM and PACM in the facility, techniques for recognizing damaged  ACM and PACM, and appropriate housekeeping techniques related to ACM and PACM.  This course must be held annually.
<p>
<font="+2"><b>Record Retention and Disclosure</b></font>
<br>

Under the new rules, a building/facility owner is required to take measures to protect a subsequent purchaser's employees by disclosing certain information about asbestos in the building/facility.  Such owners must maintain records related to any ACM and PACM in the building/facility, and disclose such information to successive owners.    OSHA acknowledges that such disclosure requirements are a significant extension of its regulatory power.  Several court challenges to OSHA's ability to promulgate such a requirement have already been filed.<STRONG>8</STRONG> 
<p>
<font="+2"><b>Standards Modified</b></font>
<br>

OSHA reduced the PELs to half of the previously permitted levels.  In addition, employers whose employees work directly with asbestos have new, more stringent exposure control methods that must be followed. 

<p>
<font="+2"><b>Conclusion</b></font>
<br>

For employers whose employees work directly with asbestos (including construction and demolition workers), OSHA's new control requirements provide very detailed techniques for such work.  The most significant effect of the regulations, however, is to require "building/facility owners" to take steps to protect housekeeping and custodial workers, even when such workers are not employed by the owner.  As a general matter, OSHA now requires owners of commercial and industrial buildings to do the following:

<UL>
<LI>perform a visual survey of ACM and PACM in a building;
<LI>disclose the results of such survey to its employees (if any) and to the employers of any housekeeping or custodial workers at the property;
<LI>retain the survey, together with any other information about ACM or PACM at the property; and 
<LI>deliver such records to the purchaser of the property. 
</UL>


Many organizations that were previously unconcerned with OSHA regulations (because, for example, they had no employees) must now be concerned with OSHA's efforts to significantly broaden its jurisdiction in the name of worker protection.

<A NAME="EMF">
</A><H2>New Study on Alleged Link Between Electromagnetic Field Exposure and Leukemia and Brain Cancer</H2><P>

<h4>by</h4>

<h4>Bruce Jones and Andrea M. Fike</h4>

This report is the second in a series of reports designed to inform you of developments in the debate that electromagnetic fields do or do not play a role in the development of various diseases.  Our first report focused on the effect this debate has on real estate and construction businesses.  This report highlights the results of a recent scientific study which examined a group of electric utility workers in an effort to determine whether such workers suffered adverse health effects from their exposure to electromagnetic fields.
<BR>

The study was conducted at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and examined mortality among electric utility workers and the possible relationship between magnetic field exposure and leukemia and brain cancer in electric utility workers.  This study is significant because it is very recent and because it relates to a sizable study group.  The study's most significant findings are that there is no association between leukemia and magnetic field exposure but that there is an association between cumulative exposure to magnetic fields and the risk of developing brain cancer.
<BR>

The study was sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute.  Nearly 140,000 workers were included in the study.  These workers were employed by five power companies: Carolina Power and Light Company, Virginia Electric Power Company, PICO Energy Company, Tennessee Valley Authority, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
<BR>

The study examined worker mortality rates based on the duration of exposure to magnetic fields and based on cumulative exposure to magnetic fields.  In order to estimate cumulative exposures for various occupational categories, researchers measured personal magnetic field exposures of randomly selected study subjects.  Personal magnetic field exposures were measured using an Average Magnetic EXposure (AMEX) meter which subjects wore for a work shift.  The AMEX meter accrues an electrical charge proportional to the cumulative magnetic field the worker comes in contact with, generating a time-weighted average exposure.  Based upon the magnetic field exposure measurements, the researchers created a job-exposure matrix.  Information regarding the duration of exposure and cumulative exposure levels of study subjects and the study group's mortality rates was compared to mortality information for the general population to determine whether any association between exposure to magnetic fields and leukemia or brain cancer exists.
<BR>

The study found that, as a group, the electric utility workers were healthier than the general population and that overall cancer mortality was lower than what would be expected based on mortality rates for the general population.  This result was not surprising to the researchers, who postulate that electrical utility workers are likely to be a group of healthy individuals due to a self-selection process.  The study also found that leukemia, including leukemia subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was not related to duration of employment in exposed jobs or to increasing cumulative magnetic field exposure.  However, a weak association between brain cancer and duration of work in exposed jobs was found in the study, and a stronger association between brain cancer and cumulative magnetic field exposures was also found.  Based on the study data, brain cancer mortality increases by a factor of 1.94 for each microtesla-year of exposure in the prior two to ten year period.  Significantly, the greatest increase in risk occurred for exposures accruing in the previous 2-10 year period, suggesting that any adverse effect of magnetic field exposure has a relatively short latency period.
<br>

It is important to recognize that no one study can prove or disprove a causal relationship between electromagnetic fields and disease.  Even the researchers for this study believe that conclusions regarding whether or not magnetic fields cause cancer still can not be drawn based upon existing research, including their study.  However, electrical utilities, product manufacturers and others interested in the claims of a relationship between various illnesses and electromagnetic fields should be aware of the study as part of their overall monitoring of this issue.

<H2>Family and Closely Held Businesses</H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
<H4>Overview of Our Practice</H4>
<P>
Faegre & Benson provides a comprehensive approach to the interrelated legal and succession planning issues that uniquely affect family and other closely held businesses.  Through its Family and Closely Held Business practice, Faegre & Benson brings together experts in corporate finance, estate planning, federal and state taxation, employee benefits, employment law, environmental law and other areas of legal specialization.  These experts work together as a team toward a common purpose:  providing family and closely held businesses, and their owners, with the highest quality legal services in a cost-effective and accessible manner.

<p>

<H4>Tailored to Distinctive Business Concerns</H4> 

The team approach is essential with family and closely held businesses.  Many decisions at the corporate level of a family or closely held business directly impact the estate and tax plans of the owners.  Employee benefits concerns have to be addressed from the perspective of the needs of the company and its ownership structure.  Employment law and many litigation issues often have distinctive problems when they arise in the family or closely held business setting.

<p>

Our experts bring experience not only in their areas of expertise, but also in working for family and closely held businesses.  The following are a few representative matters which have involved members of Faegre & Benson's Family and Closely Held Business practice:

<UL>
<LI><LI>Restructured the corporate succession plans of a mid-sized retail company with a limited number of family owners.  Issues included identifying members of the next generation having the talent and interest to take over the company, addressing the needs of other members of the next generation, adequately providing for the current generation, recapitalizing the company, revising buy-sell agreements and estate plans and ensuring a smooth transition.
<LI>Negotiated the sale of a large family controlled business in a manner that achieved optimal estate planning and tax benefits.
<LI>Drafted specifically tailored profit sharing and 401(k) plans for mid-sized firms having significant shareholders as employees.

</UL>




<H4>Demonstrated Leadership</H4>

Faegre & Benson is proud to be a principal sponsor of the Family Enterprise Forum at the University of St. Thomas Graduate School of Business and the Family Business Forum at Iowa State University.  Members of the firm's Family and Closely Held Business practice are frequent speakers at seminars on issues of particular importance to family and other closely held businesses.

<H2><b>Labor and Employment Law</b></H2><P>
</CENTER>


The firm's labor and employment lawyers represent private and public employers of all sizes in the full range of issues that arise in the workplace.  We defend employers in all types of employment-related cases, such as wrongful discharge, contract, defamation, and ERISA actions.  We also defend employers against charges before the EEOC and state and local agencies and against lawsuits alleging discrimination based on age, sex (including pregnancy and sexual harassment), race, disability, and the like.  We are experienced in representing employers in the full range of alternatives to litigation, including mediations, arbitrations, and summary trials.
<p>

Using our extensive litigation experience, we counsel employers on how to avoid lawsuits and how to reduce liability should a lawsuit arise.  We assist employers in planning for and carrying out discharges, layoffs, mergers, acquisitions, and other significant employment decisions.  We deal with workplace health and safety issues, such as drug and alcohol testing, smoking, AIDS, and OSHA matters.  We also develop affirmative action plans and respond to compliance reviews.  Our attorneys review and draft personnel policies, manuals, and agreements (including noncompetition and confidentiality provisions).  We provide advice on all of the legal issues that arise in connection with personnel and compensation administration.  We also advise employers on international employment issues, such as immigration matters and questions that arise out of foreign operations.
<p>

Our lawyers represent management in union organizing campaigns, decertification elections, labor arbitration proceedings, unfair labor practice charges before the NLRB, and collective bargaining negotiations.  We help employers deal with the problems raised by picketing, handbilling, and secondary boycotts.

</A><H2>Attorney Liability
Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 
</H2><P>

<h4><i> A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision promises continued litigation against lawyers 
engaged in collection proceedings on consumer debts.
</i></h4>
<h4>by</h4>

<h4>Ann Marie Hanrahan</h4>
On April 18, 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court held that attorneys who regularly, through litigation, collect consumer debts fall within the definition of debt collector under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the FDCPA).  Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U.S. ---, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d. 395 (1995).  This decision follows years of litigation concerning the scope of attorney liability under the FDCPA.  
<br>
Prior to 1986, the FDCPA contained an exception for collection work done by attorneys.  When Congress deleted this exception, it left an open question as to exactly when an attorney was covered by the Act, and, to a lesser extent, when an attorney's actions will actually violate the Act.
<br>
The FDCPA defines debt collector as one who uses interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect . . . debts owed to another.  While there are no specific parameters for when an attorney has crossed the line into regular debt collection, one court has set forth the following factors:  the volume of the attorney's collection activities; the frequency of the use of the collection letter in question; and whether or not there was found to be an ongoing relationship between the attorney and the collection agency he represented.  Cacace v. Lukas, 775 F. Supp. 502, 504 (D. Conn. 1990) (citation omitted).  Filing warrants and sending post-judgment letters have both been held to be debt collection for purposes of the Act.
<br>
Until Heintz, courts were split as to whether pure litigation activities constituted debt collection. In Heintz the Supreme Court held that the Act applies to all attorneys who regularly collect consumer debts, even those who do so through legal proceedings. The Court noted that Congress did not replace the attorney exception with a more narrow litigation exception, and that the plain language of the statute seems to encompass attorney debt collectors. 
<br>
From other FDCPA decisions, a number of general rules emerge that an attorney can follow to avoid FDCPA liability: 
 
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Be aware of how often the firm collects debts and the type of debts collected.  While there is no set formula, if consumer debt collection is a significant part of the firm's practice, its actions are probably covered by the Act.
<LI>After Heintz, traditional debt collection activity (sending dunning letters, etc.) as well as debt collection litigation (including, presumably, the mere filing of a complaint) may expose an attorney to potential liability.  Post-judgment collection activities are also covered by the Act.
<LI>Be aware of the least sophisticated consumer standard.  For example, while in-house counsel are not covered by the Act, if a letter sent by such counsel gives the impression to the least sophisticated consumer that the counsel is an independent attorney, liability may exist.
<LI>Does a collection letter give any impression that a lawsuit may be filed when none is actually intended?  This may expose an attorney to liability.  The test is not whether a consumer was fooled, but whether the least sophisticated consumer would be.
<LI>Sending form collection letters signed by an attorney when the attorney has not personally reviewed the individual file has been held to be a violation of the Act since it suggests that an attorney has been specifically retained in con-nection with that particular debt.  In fact, a case has been brought in federal court in Minnesota against a law firm on just those grounds.  
</UL>

While the above rules will help to avoid liability, it is important to remember that the activities discussed here are not the only potential FDCPA violations for attorneys.  They are just among those that have been litigated against attorneys.  The Act imposes many requirements, all of which apply to attorneys who regularly collect consumer debts.  Once counsel are covered by the Act (i.e., they are regularly collecting consumer debts, etc.), further research is needed to assure compliance and avoid exposure to liability.

<A NAME="EMF">
</A><H2>New Study on Alleged Link Between Electromagnetic Field Exposure and Leukemia and Brain Cancer</H2><P>

<h4>by</h4>

<h4>Bruce Jones and Andrea M. Fike</h4>
This report is the second in a series of reports designed to inform you of developments in the debate that electromagnetic fields do or do not play a role in the development of various diseases.  Our first report focused on the effect this debate has on real estate and construction businesses.  This report highlights the results of a recent scientific study which examined a group of electric utility workers in an effort to determine whether such workers suffered adverse health effects from their exposure to electromagnetic fields.
<BR>
The study was conducted at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and examined mortality among electric utility workers and the possible relationship between magnetic field exposure and leukemia and brain cancer in electric utility workers.  This study is significant because it is very recent and because it relates to a sizable study group.  The study's most significant findings are that there is no association between leukemia and magnetic field exposure but that there is an association between cumulative exposure to magnetic fields and the risk of developing brain cancer.
<BR>
The study was sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute.  Nearly 140,000 workers were included in the study.  These workers were employed by five power companies: Carolina Power and Light Company, Virginia Electric Power Company, PICO Energy Company, Tennessee Valley Authority, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
<BR>
The study examined worker mortality rates based on the duration of exposure to magnetic fields and based on cumulative exposure to magnetic fields.  In order to estimate cumulative exposures for various occupational categories, researchers measured personal magnetic field exposures of randomly selected study subjects.  Personal magnetic field exposures were measured using an Average Magnetic EXposure (AMEX) meter which subjects wore for a work shift.  The AMEX meter accrues an electrical charge proportional to the cumulative magnetic field the worker comes in contact with, generating a time-weighted average exposure.  Based upon the magnetic field exposure measurements, the researchers created a job-exposure matrix.  Information regarding the duration of exposure and cumulative exposure levels of study subjects and the study group's mortality rates was compared to mortality information for the general population to determine whether any association between exposure to magnetic fields and leukemia or brain cancer exists.
<BR>
The study found that, as a group, the electric utility workers were healthier than the general population and that overall cancer mortality was lower than what would be expected based on mortality rates for the general population.  This result was not surprising to the researchers, who postulate that electrical utility workers are likely to be a group of healthy individuals due to a self-selection process.  The study also found that leukemia, including leukemia subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was not related to duration of employment in exposed jobs or to increasing cumulative magnetic field exposure.  However, a weak association between brain cancer and duration of work in exposed jobs was found in the study, and a stronger association between brain cancer and cumulative magnetic field exposures was also found.  Based on the study data, brain cancer mortality increases by a factor of 1.94 for each microtesla-year of exposure in the prior two to ten year period.
Significantly, the greatest increase in risk occurred for exposures accruing in the previous 2-10 year period, suggesting that any adverse effect of magnetic field exposure has a relatively short latency period.
<br>
It is important to recognize that no one study can prove or disprove a causal relationship between electromagnetic fields and disease.  Even the researchers for this study believe that conclusions regarding whether or not magnetic fields cause cancer still can not be drawn based upon existing research, including their study.  However, electrical utilities, product manufacturers and others interested in the claims of a relationship between various illnesses and electromagnetic fields should be aware of the study as part of their overall monitoring of this issue.

For more than one hundred years, Faegre & Benson has provided legal services to businesses and individuals from its offices in Minneapolis.  Some of the firm's first clients were the milling and lumber companies which lead to the growth of the early Twin Cities' economy.  Now the firm represents companies from all sections of the regional and national economy, including the region's largest bank, the region's largest merchant, several of its largest hospitals, many other of the region's leading manufacturing, agricultural and service businesses and a number of Fortune 500 companies.  Faegre & Benson also serves as legal counsel for many of the region's leading civic, cultural and educational institutions, and a number of its individual lawyers play important roles in the governance of these institutions.<p>

As a result of the firm's long-time representation of Minnesota companies and its continuing involvement in the civic life of the region, Faegre & Benson provides its clients not only with sophisticated legal services in virtually every area of civil law, but provides these services with a practical understanding of the needs and wants of Minnesota clients.  The Minneapolis office, with more than 200 resident lawyers, serves as a center for the firm's other offices, making available to clients at all locations the legal resources of the entire firm.<p>

<H2>Des Moines, Iowa</H2>
</CENTER>

Des Moines' growth as a regional center of business and commerce has brought an increased demand for legal services in Iowa.  In response to the growth, Faegre & Benson in 1990 became the first regional law firm to establish an Iowa office.  Through its Des Moines office, Faegre & Benson is able to provide clients headquartered in Iowa and clients having Iowa operations with comprehensive legal services through lawyers familiar with an Iowa-based practice.<p>

The firm's Des Moines partners are native Midwesterners with highly developed local practices.  They are active in Iowa community and professional matters and for many years have represented clients interests before the Iowa courts and before state and local agencies.<p>

Faegre & Benson long has served clients with business interests in Iowa from its office in Minneapolis.  Through the Des Moines office, we now can better serve those needs through established local lawyers who are able to work in concert with more than 275 Faegre & Benson lawyers in the firm's other offices.<p>

<P>

Faegre & Benson established a London office in 1985 to assist clients who wanted experienced yet familiar representation in their dealings in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe.  Staffed with both American attorneys and English solicitors, the practice of the London office has expanded to meet the needs of American clients doing business in the European Union and international clients doing business in the United States.  In particular, the London office provides counsel for American companies seeking trade, investment and financing abroad and for foreign companies seeking trade, direct investment and general representation in the United States.  The London office also advises on all aspects of European Union law.<br>

<P>

The proximity of London to continental Europe and to our Frankfurt office enables the firm to provide clients with efficient and cost-effective service in the European Union, as well as in Eastern Europe.  Moreover, London's position as a gateway to Europe, and as a leading banking and financial center, makes it a preferred location for international financial transactions.<br>

<P>

The Firm's lawyers in London regularly work with the lawyers in our other offices and are able to draw upon the skills and experience of all the Firm's practice areas.  In matters involving Central and Eastern Europe, the London office works closely with our office in Frankfurt.<P>

Even before the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, Faegre & Benson's lawyers were active in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe on behalf of our clients.  After the Wall came down, the scope of our practice in these countries continued to expand and, in response, Faegre & Benson opened an office in Frankfurt in 1991.  The office has both American and German attorneys on staff.

<p>

The purpose of the Frankfurt office is to serve the growing needs of clients in connection with established business operations in Germany and the rest of the European Union.  The office also assists clients seeking to initiate or increase their investments in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Commonwealth of Independent States.  Frankfurt, which is a principal European hub for air travel and one of Europe's financial centers, provides a centralized base for the firm's European work.

<p>

The Frankfurt office works closely with Faegre & Benson's London and United States offices in handling and coordinating international business matters.

<STRONG>Salon A</STRONG> - <EM>Recent Developments on the Internet</EM>
<br>
The rapid growth of the Internet as a means for communicating information and transacting business has forced courts to apply traditional principles of law to cyberspace.  This session will examine recent developments in the law relating to the Internet, including personal jurisdiction, domain name disputes, junk e-mail, trademarks on the Internet, and the E-Data patent.
<P>


<STRONG>Salon E</STRONG> - <EM>Nuts & Bolts of Patents and Trade Secrets</EM>
<br>

<STRONG>Trade Secrets:</STRONG>  The trade secret segment of our presentation identifies the basic parameters of trade secret law and distinguishes trade secrets from other methods of protecting intellectual property.  We then describe the elements of a trade secret protection program.  We conclude by explaining how to protect trade secrets during employee transition.
<br>

<STRONG>Patents:</STRONG>  The patent segment of our presentation will describe the practical aspects of patent law so that the business person can better incorporate patenting strategies into competitive business planning.  We first explain how to recognize and protect patentable inventions so that valuable patent rights are not inadvertently lost.  We then explain how patent rights can be used to help meet specific business objectives.  We conclude by providing an overview of patent enforcement procedures.
<p>

<STRONG>Duluth Room</STRONG> - <EM>Litigating Patent Cases After Markman

<br>
		
<STRONG>Salon A</STRONG> - <EM>Selling Online</EM>
<br>
Because of the vast marketing and communications potential associated with the use of the Internet and online services, many companies are building web sites and selling their goods and services online.  This session will explore issues associated with sales of goods and services in online environment.  In particular, we will discuss a number of the legal concerns associated with selling retail goods over the Internet, such as the implications of accepting credit card orders, gathering and using data about clients and prospective clients for marketing purposes, enforcing licenses for software distributed under webwrap agreements, and selecting and enforcing appropriate warranties and limitations on liability.
<p>

<STRONG>Salon E</STRONG> - <EM>Nuts & Bolts of Trademarks and Copyrights</EM>
<br>

Trademarks and copyrights can be amongst the most valuable of a business' assets.  This session will provide an overview of the law that protects these assets, with an emphasis on what business people and business lawyers need to know to maximize the value of their business' rights.  Trademark topics covered will include selection and availability of a mark, federal registration procedure, proper use of a mark, and the remedies available for trademark infringement.  Copyright topics covered will include copyrightable subject matter, copyright ownership and works for hire, copyright notice and registration, and the scope of copyright protection. 
<p>

<STRONG>Duluth Room </STRONG>- <EM>Protecting Intellectual Property in Business Transactions</EM>
<br>

This seminar will provide an overview of strategies for protecting and maximizing the value of intellectual property in the course of mergers and acquisitions, financings, licensing, partnering and joint ventures as well as in relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners.  The focus will be on recurring issues such as representations and warranties, due diligence, confidentiality agreements, noncompete agreements and ownership and control of intellectual property.

<STRONG>Salon A</STRONG> - <EM>Censorship on the Internet</EM>
<br>


As use of the Internet proliferates, conflicts are arising over appropriate regulation of the content of cyberspace communications.  Congress enacted the Communications Decency Act, but a court declared it unconstitutional.  An electronic bulletin board operator in California was convicted in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, on criminal charges.  Law enforcement authorities in Germany threatened prosecution of CompuServe, an Ohio-based company, for the content of material available through CompuServes network.  In light of such developments, this seminar will provide an overview of issues related to Internet content regulation, including such issues as the First Amendment, jurisdiction, choice of law, defamation and privacy.

Significant new developments occurred in many areas of patent law in 1996.  These developments involved not only substantive changes in the law, but also several issues of first impression appearing in Federal Circuit decisions throughout the year. Several Federal Circuit decisions also interpreted the insubstantial differences test for determining infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, which was a test announced by the Federal Circuit in the important Hilton-Davis decision.  Meanwhile, the Hilton-Davis case itself is on appeal to the United States Supreme Court, which could render its decision at anytime now.  The patent bar eagerly awaits the Supreme Court decision to see how it will affect the test for determining infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.  A number of unusual district court decisions also appeared, which could be the harbinger of even more change in the patent laws in the event that such lower court decisions were to be upheld by the Federal Circuit on appeal. This session will provide an overview of these recent developments, so that patent attorneys and business persons alike can more fully appreciate how these developments might affect how patents can and cannot be used to support strategic business planning and meet specific business objectives.

<STRONG>Duluth Room</STRONG> - <EM>Insurance Issues in Intellectual Property Litigation</EM>
<br>

Insurance coverage for intellectual property disputes is an important consideration for litigants.  Cases that have held for both the insured and the insurer regarding the duty to defend and indemnify will be discussed, along with a brief outline of the procedural steps to be taken by insureds and insurers in the process of determining the applicability of insurance coverage.

<STRONG>Salon A</STRONG> - <EM>Spiders on the Web:  Avoiding Liability in the Use of the Internet</EM>
<br>

Use of the Internet may involve legal risks including claims for copyright infringement, libel and slander, harassment, trade secret misappropriation, and trademark infringement.  This presentation will focus on practical suggestions for businesses using the Internet or allowing employees access to the Internet.  Specific topics to be covered will include electronic mail policies, domain name selection, web page content, use of hyperlinks, and the development of bulletin boards.

<STRONG>Salon E</STRONG> - <EM>Recent Developments - Copyright Law</EM>
<br>

This session will explore recent developments in the law of copyrights, including recent legislation and international agreements.  The presentation will include discussion of the issue as raised in a recent Fifth Circuit case <EM>Chavez v. Arte Publico Press</EM>, 59 F.3d 539 (5th Cir. 1995).  The case is still pending reconsideration after remand from the U.S. Supreme Court subsequent to its decision in <EM>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</EM>, 517 U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. ____, 134 L.Ed. 252 (1996), which limited Congress ability to abrogate states Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  The presentation will provide background regarding why Congress cannot generally abrogate a states sovereign immunity and the limited circumstances under which it can.  It will also include a discussion of how a state might waive its immunity.  Finally, the presentation will discuss practical steps a client dealing with the state can take to protect himself or herself should the courts decide that a state may exercise their eleventh amendment sovereign immunity against copyright infringement suits brought in federal court.

<STRONG>Duluth Room</STRONG> - <EM>Changing Prescriptions for Intellectual Property in Medical Technology</EM>
<br>

Intellectual property laws of great importance to the medical technology industry are in a state of transition.  Congress recently enacted legislation which limits the remedies available against infringers of patented medical and surgical procedures.  District and Federal Circuit court decisions reflect a trend away from broad claim constructions and hostility toward the Doctrine of Equivalents as we await the Supreme Courts <EM>Hilton Davis</EM> decision.  Contracts for the acquisition and licensing of intellectual property rights continue to be critical to the successful commercialization of medical technology, and are therefore frequent topics of dispute.  In the future, the diagnosis and treatment of intellectual property issues in the medical technology field will clearly be enhanced by greater up-front focus on the patent application process and forward-thinking contract drafting.  This seminar session will describe these developments and address their impact on medical technology companies.

<STRONG>Salon A</STRONG> - <EM>Next Generation Internet Legal Issues</EM>
<br>

While virtually all Internet law is new, this session will explore several upcoming issues which are on the back burner but which could impact you over the next few years.
<p>

<STRONG>Salon E</STRONG> - <EM>Recent Developments - Trademarks</EM>
<br>
This session presents our annual review of recent developments in the always-entertaining world of trademarks and trade dress.  This year's session will address, among other topics, the developing case law interpreting the year-old Federal Trademark Dilution Act, the Warnervision opinions and their impact on intent-to-use applications, recent attempts to register sound marks, and the year's legislative developments.  The session will close with Felicia Boyd's traditional pronouncement of the Best (and Worst) of 1996, a fast-paced and energetic review of the silly and the sublime from the trademark and trade dress opinions of 1996.

<strong>Duluth Room</strong> - <EM>Intellectual Property in Transactions with the Government and Compliance with Government Export Controls</EM>
<br>
Transactions with the Federal Government can take various forms, including supply contracts, service contracts, software development contracts, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), and others.  In addition, companies engaged in the licensing or sale of intellectual property to foreign parties often fail to recognize that such transactions are subject to U.S. export control laws which can expose such companies to severe potential consequences if the laws are violated.  This presentation will discuss methods for protecting your intellectual property in government transactions and maximizing your rights in intellectual property resulting from such transactions.  The discussion will include recent developments under the Freedom of Information Act, Department of Defense software and technical data regulations, the impact of new commercial item acquisition procedures, and remedies for the governments violation of intellectual property rights.  An introduction to the scope and framework of U.S. export laws will be presented together with an update on recent developments in export controls on encryption software.

<P>

<blockquote>
Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in bankruptcy-related litigation.  Fraudulent conveyances, preferences, contract assumption/rejection issues, claim objections, objections to discharge, intellectual property issues, environmental problems, commercial disputes, and lender liability issues are only a few of the subject areas encountered in bankruptcy litigation.
<P>

Faegre & Benson lawyers have substantial experience and capability in all areas of bankruptcy and related litigation.  In large complex bankruptcies of publicly held corporations, in smaller reorganizations, and in complex cases involving individuals and partnerships, our firm brings experience, skill, and strength to representation of clients interest.  Although most bankruptcy and insolvency matters are best resolved through effective negotiation, when necessary, our lawyers have pursued litigation remedies.  Faegre & Benson lawyers pursued to the United States Supreme Court and won the leading case recognizing rights of unsecured creditors to prevent equity holders from retaining ownership of a reorganized enterprise over the objections of unpaid unsecured creditors.  That case, <EM>Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers</EM>, 485 U.S. 197 (1988), endorsed application of the "Absolute Priority Rule" in bankruptcy which provides unsecured creditors their strongest leverage for preventing confirmation of plans of reorganization unfair to the interests of creditors.
<P>

Other major bankruptcy appellate litigation by Faegre & Benson lawyers has included decisions involving successful challenges to abusive bankruptcy planning, and challenges to open-ended debtor exemption statutes.  In bankruptcy litigation matters, our firm has represented secured creditors, indenture trustees, unsecured creditors, lessors, committees, shareholders, intellectual property holders, and debtors. 
<P>

Effective representation of clients in bankruptcy and insolvency matters frequently requires more than bankruptcy expertise.  The breadth and strength of the law firm enables our bankruptcy litigators to draw upon experience in numerous complex legal areas which may arise.  Our lawyers experience in tax, real estate, leasing, mergers and acquisitions, shareholder and officer/director litigation, lender and professional liability litigation, antitrust and trade regulation, securities, employee benefits and ERISA matters, labor, environmental claims and liabilities, intellectual property, banking, securitization, international matters, construction, insurance, governmental relations, and other areas, enables our bankruptcy/insolvency litigators to draw upon virtually any area of legal expertise as the need may arise in litigation.
<P>

Effective bankruptcy litigation demands a blended expertise. Our experience in bankruptcy/insolvency matters is not limited to particular types of clients, and our experience in representing diverse interests gives our lawyers judgment and insight in addressing the complex mix of competing interests in bankruptcy matters. For example, our experience in representing debtors and unsecured creditors is helpful in representing secured creditors in bankruptcy matters.  Our experience in representing secured creditors is likewise helpful in representing unsecured creditors, shareholders, committees, insurers, and debtors.  For example, our banking and secured lender experience enables us to scrutinize claims and conduct of secured creditors asserting priority over claims of unsecured creditors, and provides insight into what is feasible in negotiations with secured creditors.  Our lawyers representation of debtors in several major Chapter 11 cases (Frontier Airlines and America West Airlines, for example) similarly provides insight from the debtors side of the table in plan negotiation and other aspects of bankruptcy reorganization.
<P>

Many disputes, of course, are best resolved through effective negotiation, not litigation.  Alternative dispute resolution can be a useful tool, and we have experience in all types of alternative dispute resolutions, but effective representation in this area is enhanced by lawyers ability and willingness to litigate when the need arises.
<P>

The experience of Faegre & Benson lawyers in non-bankruptcy litigation is an important resource.  Faegre & Benson lawyers were lead trial counsel for Alaska fishermen and other business interests in the <EM>Exxon Valdez</EM> litigation, and obtained a highly-publicized verdict of over $5.237 billion in damages.  Defense accomplishments tend to have a lower profile, but our lawyers have an impressive track record in this area as well.  "High-tech" capabilities in litigation matters can be important, and we have the experience and litigation support services to utilize the resources.  Most cases, of course, do not require such a level of investment, but, if necessary, our bankruptcy litigators can draw upon such resources.
<P>

Our domestic offices are located in Minneapolis, Denver, and Des Moines, and our contacts with local counsel throughout the country permit us to provide clients with effective representation in significant bankruptcy matters wherever they may arise.  Our extensive use of computer technology and communications, and the firms dedication to lean staffing, permit us  to provide cost-effective representation on a national basis.

<blockquote>
In large bankruptcies of publicly-held corporations, in smaller reorganizations, in complex bankruptcies involving individuals and partnerships, in out-of-court work-outs and restructurings, and in foreclosures and other enforcement proceedings, Faegre & Benson brings experience, skill and strength to the representation of secured creditors interests.  Our lawyers' experience on both the transactional and bankruptcy/work-out sides of secured financing provides the depth and perspective essential for effective representation.  We have represented major banks, small community banks, indenture trustees, insurance companies and other financial institutions.  Our clients include:

<UL>
<LI>Norwest Corporation
<LI>Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. and other Norwest affiliates
<LI>TCF Bank Savings fsb

Our lawyers have negotiated successful restructurings outside of bankruptcy as well as consensual plans of reorganization in Chapter 11 proceedings.  Faegre & Benson and its affiliate, The Faegre Group, are strong supporters of--and have considerable experience in--alternative dispute resolution.
<p>

Although we believe most restructurings and bankruptcy matters are best resolved through effective negotiation, when necessary our lawyers pursue appropriate litigation remedies.  Faegre & Benson lawyers have gone to the United States Supreme Court and won the leading bankruptcy case which recognizes the right of creditors to prevent equity holders from retaining their interests over the objection of unpaid creditors--a principal known as the "absolute priority rule."  Other significant bankruptcy litigation has included claim classification disputes, valuation of collateral, commercial reasonableness of proposed debt restructuring terms, as well as relief from stay and case dismissal proceedings.  In addition, our lawyers have obtained confirmation of a creditors plan over the debtors competing plan and objections in a real estate partnership case.  We also have considerable experience and expertise in state court repossession and foreclosure proceedings.
<p>

Representative significant cases in which our lawyers have participated on behalf of secured creditor or indenture trustee clients include:

<UL>
<LI>Bonneville Pacific Corporation (D. Utah)
<LI>Reserve Mining Company [LTV Steel] 	(S.D.N.Y.)
<LI>Interco Incorporated (E.D. Mo.)
<LI>American Continental Corporation (D. Ariz.)

Effective representation of secured creditors in bankruptcy or out-of-court restructurings frequently requires more than bankruptcy and transactional expertise.  The breadth and strength of our law firm permits our bankruptcy/insolvency lawyers to draw upon diverse experience in numerous complex legal areas which arise in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding or work-out.  Our lawyers experience in creditor litigation, tax, real estate, leasing, mergers and acquisitions, shareholder and officer/director litigation, lender and professional liability matters, environmental regulation, employee benefits, ERISA, labor law, insurance coverage issues, intellectual property, securitization, governmental relations and many other matters enables our bankruptcy/insolvency lawyers to provide virtually any area of legal expertise as the need may arise in their representation of secured creditors.
<p>

Our bankruptcy representation is not limited to secured creditor representation.  In various significant matters, Faegre & Benson has represented debtors, unsecured creditors, equity holders, committees, lessors, licensors of intellectual property rights, and other interests.  This experience enhances our ability to provide effective representation of secured creditors because the diverse experience in bankruptcy/insolvency matters gives our lawyers judgment and insight; for example, our experience in representing unsecured creditors and committees provides insight respecting the expectations -- and weaknesses -- of those interests.  Our lawyers' representation of debtors in several major Chapter 11 cases similarly provides insight from the debtor's side of the table in plan negotiation and other aspects of bankruptcy reorganization.

Faegre & Benson lawyers have represented unsecured creditors committees in several major bankruptcy cases, including:
<P>
<blockquote>

<STRONG>Colorado Ute Electric Association, Inc.</STRONG>, a generating and transmission system supplying bulk power to over 70% of the state of Colorado filed Chapter 11 on March 30, 1990.  A plan of reorganization that will in all probability pay creditors in full was confirmed in February 1992.

<STRONG>Centran Corporation</STRONG>, a Chapter 11 case of a natural gas marketing company filed in January, 1993, in which a sale of the debtor's assets was achieved and, as a result of the sale and approximately 100 preference actions, unsecured creditors recovered more than half of their claims.
<P>

<STRONG>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc.</STRONG>, a Chapter 11 case in which a complex and comprehensive set of long-term agreements with American Airlines allowed this regional and international carrier to successfully emerge from reorganization in September, 1994.
<P>

<STRONG>Ruhr/Paragon, Incorporated</STRONG>, a Chapter 11 case of an advertising agency filed in March, 1995, in which a sale of the debtor's assets and confirmation of a liquidating plan resulted in unsecured creditors recovering approximately 80% of their claims.

We have also represented bondholder committees or indenture trustees in several major bankruptcy cases, including:

<UL>
<LI>Gillet HoldingsIndenture Trustee for $550,000,000 in zero coupon notes.
<LI>Interco IncorporatedIndenture Trustee for $387,000,000 of subordinated discount debentures.
<LI>Reserve Mining Company (LTV)Indenture Trustee for $200,000,000 of pollution control revenue bonds.
<LI>American Continental CorporationIndenture Trustee for $50,000,000 of senior debentures.
<LI>G. Heileman Brewing CompanyIndenture Trustee for $35,000,000 of secured debentures.
</UL>


Representation of unsecured creditors committees in bankruptcy is difficult, and somewhat risky for lawyers.  Because legal fees and expenses of committees generally are paid from the bankruptcy estate, not by particular creditors, lawyers for committees bear the risk that fees may not be paid if the debtors bankruptcy estate has insufficient unencumbered assets to pay administrative expenses.  Also, fees are paid only to the extent approved by the Court, after scrutiny and opportunity for objection by interested parties and the United States Trustee.  Our firms philosophy is to staff all matters in a lean and efficient manner, and our rates generally are competitive with or lower than those of most law firms of our size.  In committee representation, even though our fees are not the obligation of particular creditors, we adhere to that philosophy, and view committee representation as an opportunity not only to provide professional representation in bankruptcy, but also, through effective representation,  to develop lasting professional relationships with creditors. We thus have an incentive to perform an excellent service at a reasonable price.

<H2>A Victory Over Soreheads</H2>

<H4>By</H4>

<H4>Robert L. Schnell, Jr. and Jeffrey D. Hedlund</H4>

<FONT SIZE=+2>L</FONT>ast month the United States Supreme Court handed down its decision in Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., ruling 5-4 that buyers of securities were not entitled to pursue the liberal remedies the Securities Act of 1933 gives to victims of "prospectus" fraud unless those victims were actually cheated by the use of a "prospectus."  Although such a result seems so obvious as to be unworthy of the time of the Supreme Court, the case provoked two vigorous dissents and was widely and negatively reported as limiting protections for stock buyers.  The real story behind the decision, however, is its illustration of the mounting threat posed by, what Garrison Keillor recently described in The New York Times as, a "nation of soreheads" who seek to blame others and refuse to accept responsibility for the consequences of their own conduct.<P>

The facts of Gustafson are quite straightforward: plaintiffs negotiated to buy the stock of a private company, protecting themselves with the usual array of contractual protections, representations and warranties.  Unfortunately for the buyers, however, an audit of the company after the sale showed that the company was making less money than expected.  The buyers had available all the tools in their contractual arsenal, but they had not negotiated for a provision letting them walk away from the deal if the company's profits were not as expected.<P>

The buyers attempted to remedy that defect by employing section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, a provision with powerful remedies for buyers of securities who are defrauded in their purchase of a security "by means of a prospectus or oral
communication."  Section 12(2) gives successful plaintiffs the option of rescinding the transaction, and does not require the proof of intent to defraud on the part of the defendant or of actual reliance on the part of the buyer.  Rather, section 12(2) is in some ways a strict liability provision for sellers of securities, making those who make misstatements liable unless they can prove that they did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable diligence could not have known, of the falsity of their statement.  In this age where we have all become accustomed to playing "Monday morning quarterback" without the slightest hesitation, proving the "could not have known" part of the defense standard is properly regarded as a long-shot in the best of cases.<P>

However, the buyers in Gustafson faced one major hurdle to employing the remedies of section 12(2) -- the transaction employed no document that looked anything like a "prospectus." Anyone who has ever been asked to buy stock on a public offering has probably seen a prospectus.  It has a distinctive appearance, is filled with detailed disclosures of financial and business information, contains extensive disclaimer and cautionary language in most cases, and is prepared with heavy lawyer and accounting involvement.<P>

In a private sale transaction like that involved in Gustafson, there is no "prospectus" in the ordinary sense.  In fact, the typical private sale transaction involves an extensive due diligence investigation by the potential buyer, and aggressive, arm's length negotiations.  That situation is a world apart from the offering of stock on preestablished terms to faceless buyers whose only investigation is limited by practical circumstances to a review of a document furnished by the promoters of the investment.  The facts in Gustafson fit the typical private sale mold -- extensive due diligence leading to a detailed, heavily negotiated stock purchase agreement.<P>

Lacking a prospectus in the normal sense, the Gustafson plaintiffs seized on the definitional section of the Securities Act in an attempt to perform the magic of turning a document created to memorialize arm's length negotiations -- the stock purchase agreement -- into the legal equivalent of a document generated to inform those who must rely on someone else to gather information -- the prospectus.  Under the admittedly creative theory advanced by the Gustafson plaintiffs, a "prospectus" could be any written communication, even a note on a cocktail napkin from your broker at lunch.<P>

Although the Gustafson case arose from a private stock transaction, it raised issues extending far beyond that context, for brokers routinely send out research reports or other written communications about stocks to their actual or potential customers.  If those are all considered a "prospectus", and subject brokers to the sort of strict liability the Securities Act establishes, then brokers would become targets virtually any time a stock on which they have written anything experiences a market decline.<P>

One obvious negative consequence of that broad approach is the chilling effect it would have on the transmission of information about securities.  The capital formation process in the United States is correctly regarded as the most efficient and successful in the world in large measure because of the quantity and quality of its information flows.  Were analysts and others in the information chain subjected to strict Securities Act liabilities, they -- like journalists without the protection of the Supreme Court's "actual malice" standard -- would think at least twice before circulating information that had not been subjected to the rigors of the prospectus drafting process.  The imposition of Securities Act liabilities on such activities would simply price most routine research out of the market, to the disadvantage of our capital markets and investors.<P>

By the narrowest of margins, the Supreme Court reached the sensible result by holding that the term "prospectus" is a term of art referring to the commonly seen booklet of information about a newly offered stock, and does not mean just any writing.  Even the dissenters agreed that good public policy supported the majority.<P>

If you think about it, the case shouldn't have been that hard.  Why should the language of the Securities Act be tortured to help a large, sophisticated buyer of a business who had ample ability to protect itself and just failed to do an adequate job?  Why shouldn't such a buyer be required to bargain for the contractual protections it desires and be foreclosed from seeking to rewrite the contract under the Securities Act after the fact?  As Keillor advised his nation of soreheads, the government "can't come to your home and blow your nose.  You have to do that yourself, my dear."  Fortunately, at least this time, the Supreme Court agreed.<P>

<TITLE> Education Department Issues Guidance on Peer Sexual
Harassment Policies </title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>
<h2>Education Department Issues Guidance on Peer Sexual
Harassment Policies</H2>

<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>s we reported in our last Issue Update, in two recent decisions, United States Circuit Courts of Appeal reached contrary conclusions regarding a schools liability for student-to-student sexual harassment under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  Compare <EM>Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</EM>, 74 F.3d 1186 (11th Cir. 1996), with <EM>Rowinsky v. Bryan Independent School District</EM>, 80 F.3d 1006 (5th Cir. 1996).
<P>

In response to the controversy created by these decisions, the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education (OCR), the agency responsible for enforcing Title IX, issued draft policy guidelines to advise educational institutions of the standards OCR will use in investigating and resolving hostile environment claims based on peer sexual harassment.
<P>

Liability of educational institution for peer sexual harassment.  According to OCR, a school is not necessarily responsible under Title IX for the actions of the harassing student.  A school may be liable if:
<OL>
<LI>a hostile environment exists;
<LI>the school has notice of the harassment; and
<LI>the school fails to take reasonable, timely and effective corrective action.
</OL>

In addition, OCR may hold a school liable for sexually harassing conduct by third parties, e.g., members of a visiting athletic team.  However, OCR will consider the level of control the school has over the alleged harasser in evaluating liability.
<P>

Behavior that constitutes sexual harassment. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when the conduct is so severe, persistent, or pervasive that it affects a students ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program, or creates a hostile or abusive educational environment.  In determining whether behavior constitutes sexual harassment, OCR will examine the following:
<OL>
<LI>the degree to which the conduct affected one or more students education;
<LI>the type, frequency and duration of the conduct;
<LI>the number of individuals involved;
<LI>the age and sex of the alleged harasser and the target of the harassment;
<LI>the size of the school, location of the incidents and context in which they occurred;
<LI>other incidents at the school involving the same students; and
<LI>incidents of gender-based, but non-sexual, harassment such as verbal or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex, but not involving sexual activity or language.
</OL>


<STRONG>Notice requirement.</STRONG>  It is OCRs position that the mere presence of peer sexual harassment does not impose liability on a school.  A school must fail to take appropriate action after having notice of the sexual harassment to be in violation of Title IX.  According to OCR, a school has notice when it actually knows, or with the exercise of reasonable care should have known, about the harassment.  A school receives notice when:
<OL>
<LI>a student files a grievance or complaint with a teacher about a fellow students sexually harassing behavior;
<LI>a student, parent or other individual contacts other appropriate personnel such as a principal, campus security officer, bus driver, teacher or staff member;
<LI>an agent or responsible employee witnesses the harassment; or
<LI>the school should have known about the harassment through a reasonable or diligent inquiry.
</OL>


<STRONG>Schools response.</STRONG>  When a school has notice, it must take reasonable, timely and effective corrective action.  OCR lists the following appropriate responses:
<OL>
<LI>appropriate steps should be taken to end the harassment, such as counseling, discipline or changes in housing arrangements;
<LI>appropriate steps should be taken to prevent any further harassment;
<LI>steps should be taken to ensure that there is no retaliation against the student complaining of harassment; and
<LI>a school should conduct a full and thorough investigation of any incident or complaint.
</OL>

<P>

<STRONG>Prevention.</STRONG>  OCR suggests that schools adopt and publicize a policy specifically prohibiting sexual harassment and provide training to administrators, teachers, and staff.  Appropriate classroom information should be given to students to ensure that they understand the types of conduct that can be sexual harassment and that there is a grievance procedure in the event that they are a victim of sexual harassment.  
<P>

<STRONG>Grievance procedures.</STRONG>  	  Under Title IX, a school is required to adopt a grievance procedure providing for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex.  In evaluating a grievance procedure, OCR looks for:
<OL>
<LI>notice to students, parents and employees of the procedure;
<LI>application of the procedures to complaints alleging harassment by students;
<LI>adequate and reliable investigation of complaints by an impartial investigator, including the opportunity for the parties to present witnesses and other evidence;
<LI>designated time-frames for the major stages of the complaint process;
<LI>notice to the parties of the disposition of the complaint; and
<LI>steps taken to prevent reccurrence of any previous harassment and to correct its effects on students.
</OL>

The procedures should be readily available and understandable to all students.
<P>

The guidance issued by OCR can be an effective tool for schools in drafting effective policies and in determining how to respond to these difficult situations.  However, the precise legal standard that will be applied in determining if and when a school will be liable for peer sexual harassment may remain uncertain until the United States Supreme Court considers the issue.

<TITLE> Podberesky v. Kirwan Race-Based Scholarships </title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<h2><EM>Podberesky v. Kirwan</EM> 
Race-Based Scholarships</H2>



<FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>n October 27, 1994, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found unconstitutional a merit-based scholarship program at the University of Maryland for which only African-American students are eligible.  <EM>Podberesky v. Kirwan</EM>, 1994 WL 587092 (4th Cir. (MD)).  The case demonstrates the difficult hurdles that a public university must overcome to justify race-conscious scholarships under the Constitution.  Because the issue in the case was the constitutionality of a scholarship program offered by a public institution, the case most likely has no impact on private colleges and universities.<p>

Daniel Podberesky sued the University of Maryland, alleging that the race-conscious scholarship program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The University argued that the program was justified by its need to address four present effects of past discrimination:  1) the University's poor reputation in the African-American community; 2) an under-representation of African-Americans in the student population; 3) the low retention and graduation rates of African-American students; and 4) a racially hostile atmosphere on campus.  Although he met the academic requirements of the program, Podberesky was ineligible for the scholarship solely because he is not black. <p>
		
The District Court granted summary judgment to the University, finding that there were sufficient present effects of past discrimination to justify maintenance of the program and that the program was narrowly tailored to remedy those effects.  <p>

<h4>'Strict Scrutiny' Appeal</h4>

Podberesky appealed and argued that the scholarship program was invalid under the strict scrutiny test that the Supreme Court developed to analyze the constitutionality of race-conscious affirmative action plans.  The Fourth Circuit agreed.  The court concluded that a race-conscious measure like the scholarship program is constitutional only if its proponent demonstrates:  (1) strong evidence that the remedial action is necessary because sufficient present effects of past discrimination exist; and (2) that it is narrowly tailored to meet the remedial goal.  <p>

The court found the scholarship program deficient on both counts.  The court decided that each present effect of past discrimination offered by the University was flawed because there was a weak causal connection between the effect and the past discrimination, the effect was of insufficient magnitude to justify the program, or the statistical proof of the claimed effect was flawed.  <p>

The court also said that the program was not narrowly tailored to meet the University's remedial goals.  The effect of the program was not limited to the problems it was intended to remedy and the University had failed to attempt to solve the problems with race-neutral alternatives.  <p>

The <EM>Podberesky</EM> case demonstrates that a public university has a very heavy burden to justify race-conscious scholarship programs.  The decision, however, probably does not affect private colleges and universities.  The basis for the court's decision was the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Because the challenge to the scholarship program was based on Fourteenth Amendment governmental entities, <EM>Podberesky</EM> only applies in cases involving state action.  Courts do not generally consider private colleges and universities state actors for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.  State action is present only when a private college or university's conduct is fairly attributable to the government, such as when the government exercised coercive power over the conduct or significantly encouraged it.  <p>

<TITLE> 1996 Minnesota Employment and Employee Benefits 
	Legislation </title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<h2>1996 Minnesota Employment and Employee Benefits 
	Legislation</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Employee Benefits Group</h4>

The 1996 Legislative Session in Minnesota was marked by comparatively little activity in the areas of labor and employment law.  Most significant initiatives stalled in committee, or  like the bill to establish a "livable wage"  were vetoed by the Governor.
<p>

Bills that became law are briefly described below.  We thoroughly analyzed these new laws and a host of other non-legislative developments at our Labor & Employment Law Groups Annual Seminar on October 9, 1996 in Minneapolis and October 10, 1996 in Denver.  Please contact <A HREF="mailto:smcgrath@faegre.com">Shannon McGrath</A> for copies of seminar materials.
<p>

<OL type=1>
<LI><STRONG><EM>School-Related Activities Leave.</EM>  Chapter 341.</STRONG>  Expands availability of unpaid leave for parents to attend their childrens "school-related activities" (a change from "classroom activities").  The bill also removed the laws requirement that an eligible employee must have been employed for at least one year.  Employers with written leave policies should revise provisions that pertain to "school conference" or "classroom activities" leave.  Effective July 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Damages for Bias Offenses.</EM>  Chapter 468.</STRONG>  Provides civil action to recover damages from a person who commits a "bias offense," which is defined as "conduct that would constitute a crime and was committed because of the victims or anothers actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability as defined in section 363.01, age, or national origin."  A plaintiff may recover the greater of $500 or actual general and special damages, including damages for emotional distress, and may also seek punitive damages under Minn. Stat. §§ 549.191 and 549.20 and injunctive or "other appropriate relief."  A jury trial is available, and the statute of limitations is six years.  The statute provides that it does not affect any other rights or remedies of the plaintiff under other laws.  Effective August 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Payment of Wages  Penalties.</EM>  Chapter 386.</STRONG>  Amends various procedures relating to the enforcement of wage and hour laws and other laws related to the payment of wages and permits the Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industry to order an employer who violates the minimum wage statute on various other statutes and rules to pay "backpay, gratuities and compensatory damages less any amount actually paid to the employee by the employer and for an additional equal amount as liquidated damages."  An employer who repeatedly or willfully violates certain sections "shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation for each employee."  This statute also amends Minn. Stat. § 177.27 to permit an employee to bring a civil action seeking redress directly in district court.  Moreover, it contains a provision permitting the recovery of attorneys fees.  Effective August 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Drug and Alcohol Testing.</EM>  Chapter 377.</STRONG>  Exempts employers covered by the federal Department of Transportations alcohol and controlled substances regulations from the Minnesota drug and alcohol testing statute, provided that their programs comply with the federal regulations that govern such programs for transportation workers.  Accordingly, covered employers who follow the federal rules for alcohol testing and who test only for the five drugs for which the federal regulations require testing (marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine) do not need to comply with the Minnesota rules governing drug and alcohol testing.  Effective March 28, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Workers Compensation.</EM>  Chapter 374.</STRONG>  Removes caps and limits on modifications to workers compensation base premiums and makes various other technical and pilot program changes.
<p>

The amendment also adopts a statutory rule governing independent contractor status for construction workers.  The statute now provides that, as a "general rule," "every independent contractor doing commercial or residential building construction or improvements in the public or private sector is, for the purpose of this chapter, an employee under this chapter . . . [.]"  An independent contractor is <EM>not</EM> considered an employee for the purpose of determining potential workers compensation eligibility, only if <EM>all</EM> of the following conditions are met:
<p>

<ol type=a>
<LI>the independent contractor maintains a separate business with the independent contractors own office, equipment, materials, and other facilities;
<p>

<LI>the independent contractor holds or has applied for a federal employer identification number;
<p>

<LI>the independent contractor operates under contracts to perform specific services or work for specific amounts of money and under which the independent contractor controls the means of performing the services or work;
<p>

<LI>the independent contractor incurs the main expenses related to the service or work that the independent contractor performs under the contract;
<p>

<LI>the independent contractor is responsible for the satisfactory completion of work or services that the independent contractor contracts to perform and is liable for a failure to complete the work or service;
<p>

<LI>the independent contractor receives compensation for work or service performed under a contract on a commission or per-job or competitive bid basis and not on any other basis;
<p>

<LI>the independent contractor may realize a profit or suffer a loss under contracts to perform work or service;
<p>

<LI>the independent contractor has continuing or recurring business liabilities or obligations; and
<p>

<LI>the success or failure of the independent contractors business depends on the relationship of business receipts to expenditures.
<p>

Various effective dates, some as of March 27, 1996, two retroactive to January 1, 1996.
</ol>
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Alternative Dispute Resolution Privilege.</EM>  Chapter 388.</STRONG>  Provides an evidentiary privilege for persons presiding at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding established by law, under court rules, or by an agreement to mediate.  Under this provision, parties to litigation cannot compel a mediator to testify about information that the mediator acquired during the mediation process.  Effective August 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Reemployment Insurance.</EM>  Chapter 417.</STRONG>  Chapter 417 makes various modifications to the reemployment insurance law.  Of particular interest is subdivision 5(b), which states that:  "benefits paid a claimant whose separation from employment was required by a law or Minnesota administrative rule mandating a background check or whose separation from employment was required by law or Minnesota administrative rule because of a criminal conviction shall not be charged to an employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions or to the experience rating of an employer."  This new exception is retroactive to the date of the law or the rule mandating the background check or requiring the separation.  The 51-page act makes other technical and administrative changes to the reemployment insurance statute.  Most sections effective on July 1, 1996, nine sections on April 3, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Same Sex Athletics.</EM>  Chapter 431.</STRONG>  Provides that the Minnesota Human Rights Acts sex discrimination prohibition does not apply to restricting membership on an athletic team or in a program or event to participants of one sex "if the restriction is necessary to preserve the unique character of the team, program, or event and it would not substantially reduce comparable athletic opportunities for the other sex."  Effective April 3, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Prohibition of Discrimination in Insurance Based on Domestic Abuse.</EM>  Chapter 278.</STRONG>  Prohibits, for life and health insurance coverage purposes, discrimination in rates or coverage based on whether the insured has been or is a victim of domestic abuse.  Allows certain underwriting practices if an insurer does not consider whether a condition was caused by such abuse.  Effective August 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Prohibition of Retroactive Termination of Benefits.</EM>  Chapter 304.</STRONG>  Generally, prohibits retroactive termination of group health and life insurance coverage without the written consent of the covered person.  The bill contains certain, limited exceptions.  Effective March 14, 1996 for coverage issued or renewed on or after that date.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>48-Hour Minimum Maternity Benefits.</EM>  Chapter 335.</STRONG>  Requires insured health plans that provide maternity benefits to provide, consistent with other contract terms, coverage for a minimum of 48 hours of inpatient care following a vaginal delivery and a minimum of 96 hours of inpatient care following a caesarean section.  Bars incentives to encourage departures prior to these minimum periods and requires specific post-delivery care coverage if the mother and newborn have less than the minimum period of inpatient care.  Effective March 20, 1996 for all health plans issued or renewed on or after that date.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Prohibition against Termination of Insurance Agents based on Government Contacts.</EM>  Chapter 433.</STRONG>  Clarifies that existing law bars insurance companies from terminating agents as a result of contacts with any branch of government regarding a problem that the agent or an insured may have with an insurance company.  Effective retroactively to May 18, 1989 (effective date of original statute).
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Omnibus Insurance Law Amendments Act.</EM>  Chapter 446.</STRONG>  118-page omnibus act.  New requirements relating to employee benefits include:
<p>

<ul>
<LI>No health policy or contract may require notice to the health carrier as a condition for receiving coverage from birth for a dependent newborn infant (including a dependent grandchild of an employee).  If the policy requires an additional premium for the additional coverage, the carrier can collect it retroactively after it becomes aware of the new dependent.
<p>

<LI>Health plans that cover lab or diagnostic tests or x-rays must provide coverage for such tests when ordered by an advanced practice nurse.
<p>

<LI>Coverage required for registered nurse who performs surgical first assistant functions.
<p>

<LI>Health plans must cover prostate cancer screening for men age 40 or older who are symptomatic or in a high-risk category and for all men age 50 or older.  Ceases to apply on August 1, 1998.
</ul>
<p>

Effective August 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>MNJOBS Program Act  Health Plan Requirements.</EM>  Chapter 465.</STRONG>  Article 5 of this law requires health plans to cover treatment of diagnosed Lyme disease and prohibits special deductibles, copayments, waiting periods or other restrictions on that coverage.  Applies to health plans covering Minnesota residents that are issued or renewed on or after August 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Mandatory Arbitration for Charitable Hospitals.</EM>  Chapter 382.</STRONG>  Expands use of mandatory arbitration by charitable hospitals and their employees.  Effective August 1, 1996.
<p>

<LI><STRONG><EM>Charitable Organization Reporting Requirements.</EM>  Chapter 384.</STRONG>  Modifies enforcement powers of the Commissioner of Commerce, specifying cease and desist order authority and procedures; expands charitable organization financial reporting and reporting of compensation of highly paid officers and employees; extends written estimate requirements to repairs costing up to $7,500; defines nonconformities for assistive listening devices; provides for pilot project to study coordinating workers compensation and insurance for state and other government employees; and requires consideration of optional long-term care insurance benefit for state employees.  Most sections effective March 28, 1996.

<h3>Executive Summary . . .<p>
Avoiding disclosure to an IRS field auditor of the analysis of an employee benefit plan problem prepared by an accounting or consulting firm.</h3><p>


An outside accounting or consulting firm frequently is engaged to conduct a compliance audit or an analysis of a known problem:  Outside accounting and consulting firms frequently are engaged by employers to conduct a major portion of . . .

<OL>
<LI>A compliance audit that looks for disqualifying defects in pension or profit sharing plans.
<LI>The analysis of a disqualifying defect that the employer has itself discovered.  
</OL>

In many instances the accounting or benefits consulting firm will discover or analyze a problem that is difficult and costly to correct retroactively:  If the IRS knows of a disqualifying defect, it will frequently require the employer to make very costly retroactive corrections.  Correcting only on a going forward basis usually does not satisfy the IRS.<P>

In many instances, an employer will want to have the option to assert a privilege with respect to the work of an accounting or consulting firm:  If the privilege can be maintained, there are three troubling items that the employer may prevent the IRS from discovering:

<OL>
<LI>The existence of the defect:  The IRS might  not discover the defect on its own.
<LI>That the employer knew of the defect:  If the IRS learns that the employer had knowledge of the defect and consciously decided not to fully correct it, the IRS may be prompted to impose more severe sanctions.
<LI>A possible candid analysis of the defect:  The accounting or consulting firm may have provided a very candid written or oral analysis of the defect that is contrary to the position the employer would like to take in negotiating the matter with the IRS (or in subsequent litigation with the IRS, DOL or a private litigant).
</OL>

A number of practical lessons can be learned from a recent Second Circuit case, U.S. v. Adlman:  The most promising privilege is the attorney-client privilege.  The Adlman case presents a number of helpful lessons for maintaining the attorney-client  privilege.  See below.<P>

The lessons of U.S. v. Adlman . . .	

<UL type=square>
<LI>Avoid the factual inference that the employer is directly seeking the advice of the accounting or benefit consulting firmrather than the advice of a lawyer.
<LI>Make a contemporaneous record of the intent to maintain a privilege.
<LI>Be assured that the employer's independent auditing firm will wall-off its employee benefit consulting services.
</UL>

Or consider hiring a different firm.

<h2>Avoiding disclosure to an IRS field auditor of the analysis of an employee benefit plan problem prepared by an accounting or consulting firm.<BR></h2>
Lessons from the Second Circuit's decision in . . .<BR>
<h3>United States of America v. Monroe Adlman. </h3>
By Dick Brennan, Hugh Forcier and Paul Heiring<p>


In late 1995, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an opinion in <EM>Adlman</EM> (68 F.3d 1495) that provides meaningful instruction for an employer that wishes to minimize the risk that an IRS field auditor may discover an analysis of employee benefit plan problems prepared by the employer's consultants or independent auditor.  <p>

Frequently, an accounting firm or benefit consulting firm will be engaged to assess whether a qualified pension or profit sharing plan is at risk of losing its qualified status under the tax laws.  It is not uncommon for the firm to find that potentially disqualifying defects do exist.  And sometimes the accounting or consulting firm's analysis can be very incriminating.  In these cases, it is important to be able to keep an IRS field auditor from compelling disclosure of the analysis (see discussion below).  <P>

Although not an employee benefit plan case, the <EM>Adlman</EM> case discusses several issues that are relevant to an analysis of employee benefit plan problems prepared by accounting or consulting firms. The Adlman case involved the analysis of the tax implications of a corporate restructuring prepared by Arthur Andersen & Co. (AA) for the Sequa Corporation.  (AA also served as the independent auditor of Sequa's financial statements.)  When the analysis was requested by the IRS as part of a tax audit, Sequa attempted to prevent discovery by asserting both the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine.  Sequa lost on the attorney-client privilege issue.  The case was remanded on the work product doctrine.  <p>

The work product doctrine (and a related privilege, the self-evaluation privilege) would rarely apply to an analysis of employee benefit plan problems prepared by an accounting firm or consulting firm.  Therefore, in this newsletter we will focus only on the attorney-client privilege.<p>

The three lessons of the Adlman case are listed below. <P>


<STRONG>The lessons of U.S. v. Adlman . . .

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#inference">Avoid the factual inference that the employer is directly seeking the advice of the accounting or benefit consulting firmrather than 	the advice of a lawyer.</A>
<LI><A HREF="#record">Make a contemporaneous record of the intent to maintain a privilege.</A>

<blockquote><hr><center><strong>The three types of disclosures an employer 
will seek to avoid:</strong></center>

The accounting or consulting firm may well discover a defect that is very expensive for the employer to correct retroactivelyat least to the satisfaction of the IRS.  If the defect is not fully corrected, the analysis provided by the accounting or consulting firms may increase the employer's exposure.  This increased exposure is created if the IRS can discover the results of the analysis.  In that case, the IRS will discover three potentially troubling items:

<ol>
<li>The existence of the defect:  The IRS will find the defect (a defect it might not have discovered on its own).
<li>That the employer knew of the defect:  The IRS will learn that the employer had knowledge of the defect and consciously decided not to fully correct it (a discovery that may prompt the IRS to impose more severe sanctions).
<li>A possible candid analysis of the defect:  The IRS may obtain a candid analysis of the defect that is contrary to the position the employer would like to take in negotiating the matter with the IRS (and in potential subsequent litigation with the IRS, DOL, or plan participants). n
</oL>
<hr></blockquote>

<A NAME="inference"></A><H3>Avoid the factual inference that the employer <br>
is directly seeking the advice of the accounting <br>
or benefit consulting firm  rather than the advice of a lawyer.</H3>

In Adlman, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals relied on two key arguments to uphold the district court's finding that Sequa had not satisfied its burden of proof to establish the attorney-client privilege.  <P>

The first argument was that no attorney-client privilege should apply because Sequa had sought the advice of the accounting firmrather than the advice of its lawyer.  The remainder of this section describes why that conclusion is fatal to the establishment of the privilege, and how an employer might avoid a court reaching a similar conclusion if an accounting or consulting firm is engaged in connection with the review of a potential employee benefit plan problem.<P>


<blockquote><hr><strong>
The involvement of an accounting or consulting firm is not    protected by the attorney-client privilege if the facts establish that the client was seeking the advice of the accounting or   consulting firm rather than the lawyer.<br>
</strong><hr></blockquote>

It is well established that if a lawyer consults with an accounting (or consulting) firm for the purpose of helping the lawyer provide legal advice, the communications between the lawyer, accountant, and client are generally protected by the attorney-client privilege.

A leading case establishing the extension of the attorney-client privilege to accountants who are assisting a lawyer is <EM>United States v. Kovel</EM>, 296 F.2d 918 (2d Cir. 1961).  That case also established the limitations on the extension of the privilege.<p>

In <EM>Kovel</EM>, the court began its analysis by noting that if an attorney hired a foreign language translator to interpret communications from the lawyer's client, the attorney-client privilege would apply to the translator.  The court went on as follows:

<blockquote>Accounting concepts are a foreign language to some lawyers in almost all cases, and to almost all lawyers in some cases.  Hence the presence of an accountant, . . . while the client is relating a complicated tax story to the lawyer, ought not destroy the privilege. . . .<p>

<center>* * * * *</center><p>

What is vital to the privilege is that the communication be made <EM>in confidence</EM> for the purpose of obtaining <EM>legal</EM> advice <EM>from the lawyer</EM>.  <strong>If what is sought is not legal advice but only accounting service, . . . or if the advice sought is the accountant's rather than the lawyer's, no privilege exists.</strong></blockquote>

<EM>Id.</EM> at 92-22 (italics in original, citation omitted and bold added).<p>

In <EM>Adlman</EM>, the Second Circuit found ample support in the record for the district court's conclusion that Sequa was seeking the advice of AArather than the advice of Sequa's in-house attorney.  AA provided a variety of audit, accounting and advisory services and there was no evidence AA was acting other than in an accounting capacity.  Moreover, the in-house lawyer was not merely a lawyerhe was also the Vice President of Tax of the Company.  <p>

While the facts that will tend to prove the point one way or the other will vary from case to case, the facts that were relevant to the district court in <EM>Adlman</EM> are useful to examine in the context of a typical case.  They will be discussed in the balance of this section.<p>


<blockquote><hr><strong>
To bolster the conclusion that the client was seeking the advice of the lawyer, the lawyer should have at least as much substantive expertise as the accountant.</strong><hr></blockquote>

In its brief, the IRS relied on the fact that AA was far more experienced in the particular tax law issue being examined than was the in-house legal counsel that Sequa was claiming it had relied upon.  The government made much of this disparate expertise, which resulted in the inference being drawn that the in-house lawyer merely approved AA's conclusions on the legal issues, and that the lawyer was not using the AA analysis to assist him in reaching his own conclusions.<p>

<blockquote><hr><strong>To bolster the conclusion that the client was seeking the advice of the lawyer, the accountant's engagement should emphasize analysis of the facts and accounting issueswith any legal conclusions being reached in conjunction with the lawyer.</strong><hr></blockquote>


In its brief to the Second Circuit, the government made much of the fact that AA was independently reaching legal conclusions.  If the accounting or consulting firm is to be involved in analyzing what are essentially legal issues (and in most employee benefit plan situations that will frequently be the case), any legal analysis should be performed in conjunction with the lawyer.  Simply running the accounting or consulting firm's legal conclusions past the lawyer after those conclusions have been reached is not sufficient. <p>


<blockquote><hr><strong>To bolster the conclusion that the client was seeking the advice of the lawyer, the accountant should not express conclusions of the law directly  to the client.</strong><hr></blockquote>

Another key fact in <EM>Adlman</EM> was that AA provided a summary of its advice directly to non-lawyers and executives at Sequa and offered to discuss the summary with them.  And AA, in a different memo later sent directly to non-lawyer executives, expressed views such as No current federal tax liability will be created as a result of the restructuring, and There should be no penalty imposed as long as the transaction is adequately disclosed in the tax return.  In its brief to the Second Circuit, the government made much of the fact that AA issued these opinions directly to non-lawyer executives. <p><p>

<A NAME="record"></A><H3>Make a contemporaneous record of <br>
the intent to maintain a privilege.</H3>

The other key reason the Second Circuit refused to recognize a privilege in <EM>Adlman</EM> was that, in the words of the Second Circuit:  

<blockquote>There was virtually no contemporaneous documentation that AA was working under a different arrangement from that which governed the rest of its work for Sequa.</blockquote>

68 F.3d at 1500.<p>

It has long been the common wisdom of practitioners that, to sustain the extension of the attorney-client privilege to accountants, the lawyer should separately engage the accountant and contemporaneous records of that engagement should be kept separate from any other services that the accountant performs for the client.  In its brief to the Second Circuit, the government made much of the fact that in the Adlman case this common wisdom was not followed in practice:

<blockquote>Commentators have . . . noted that extrinsic evidence proving that an accountant and an attorney intended to enter a <EM>Kovel</EM> relationship is critical.  For example, a leading treatise states that [a] letter agreement establishing the [<em>Kovel</em>] relationship of the accountant and the representative is essential. . . .  If the accountant who performs the service is the taxpayer's accountant . . . the change in client (taxpayer to representative) becomes difficult to identify and prove.  M. Saltzman, IRS Practice and Procedure ¶ 12.04[5], at 12-54-55 (2d ed. 1991).  Similarly, a prominent tax attorney has cautioned that

<blockquote>[t]o safeguard the <EM>Kovel</EM> privilege, the attorney should send an engagement letter to the accountant which recites that the accountant is working under the direction of the attorney, in connection with the attorney's rendition of legal services to the client; that the communications between the accountant and the client are made solely for purposes of enabling the attorney to give legal advice to the client. . . .<p>

<center>* * * * *</center><p>

<strong>Assuming that the attorney and the accountant conform their conduct to the requirements of the law outlined above</strong>, the workpapers of the Kovel accountant will be immune from production to government under an IRS summons. . . .</blockquote></blockquote>

L. Feld, <EM>Tax Fraud</EM>, 254 ALI-ABA 159, 164-66 (1988) (bold added).

In its response, Sequa argued that the government's position would elevate form over substance.  The Second Circuit dismissed that argument with the following discussion:

<blockquote>Sequa claims that the district court erroneously required a separate retainer agreement or individualized billing statements distinguishing AA's work on the AA memo from other services provided to Sequa.  The district court's conclusion, and our approval of it here, establishes no such requirement.  It is the burden of the party asserting the privilege to establish facts in support thereof.  <EM>von Bulow</EM>, 811 F.2d at 144.  Deciding whether the attorney-client privilege exists requires common sense . . . in light of reason and experience, and should be determined on a case-by-case basis.  In this instance, the absence of contemporaneous documentary proof supporting Sequa's interpretation of the facts, taken together with the presence of contemporaneous documentation supporting the government's interpretation, strongly supports the district court's finding.  The district court's observation that <strong>Sequa's contention was weakened by the absence of a contemporaneous retainer agreement was merely an application of common sense to the circumstances and not, as Sequa contends, an elevation of form over substance.</strong></blockquote>

68 F.3d at 1500, n. 1 (bold added). <br>
Whether it is or is not form over substance, the <EM>Adlman</EM> case shows that making a contemporaneous record of the intent to enter into an attorney-client privileged relationship is important to establishing the privilege. <p>

<A NAME="assured"></A><H3>Be assured that the employer's 
<br>independent auditing firm will wall-off 
<br>its employee benefit consulting services.  
<P>
Or consider hiring a different firm.</H3>

The <EM>Adlman</EM> case is relevant to a troubling issue that comes up when the accounting firm engaged to assist the lawyer is also the independent auditor of the client's financial statements.  In general terms, the question is whether the accounting firm's duties as the auditor of the client's financial statement are <EM>per se</EM> inconsistent with the extension of the privilege to the accounting firm's separate consulting services.  While neither the district court or the Second Circuit specifically addressed the issue in the <EM>Adlman</EM> case, the case indicates the position that the government will take. 

<blockquote><strong>In <EM>Adlman</EM> the government took the position that any privilege that would otherwise have been extended to AA would have been waived to the extent that          information was shared with the AA staff that was responsible for the independent audit of the client's financial statement.</strong></blockquote>

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that no privilege can exist with respect to information provided by the client to the independent auditor of its financial statements in connection with accounting firm's analysis of a reserve established by the client on its financial statement for contingent liabilities.<P>

In <EM>United States v. Arthur Young & Co.</EM>, 465 U.S. 805 (1984), the government sought to subpoena tax accrual workpapers that were prepared by Arthur Young in connection with its independent audit of the financial statements of Amerada Hess Corp.  The workpapers were prepared by Arthur Young as part of its analysis of the adequacy of the reserve for contingent tax liabilities that was recorded in the Amerada Hess financial statements.<P>

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the argument that a legal privilege (in that case the work product doctrine) should be extended to the independent auditor, at least when it is acting in its capacity as auditor.  The Court noted that an auditor's position <EM>vis-a-vis</EM> the client is very different than that of the client's lawyer: 

<blockquote>[W]e find unpersuasive the argument that a work-product immunity for accountants' tax accrual workpapers is a fitting analogue to the attorney work-product doctrine established in <EM>Hickman v. Taylor</EM>, 329 US 495, 91 L Ed 451, 67 S. Ct 385 (1947).  The Hickman work-product doctrine was founded upon the private attorney's role as the client's confidential adviser and advocate, a loyal representative whose duty it is to present the client's case in the most favorable possible light.  An independent certified public accountant performs a different role.  By certifying the public reports that collectively depict a corporation's financial status, the independent auditor assumes a <EM>public</EM> responsibility transcending any employment relationship with the client.  The independent public accountant performing this special function owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation's creditors and stockholders, as well as to the investing public.  This public watchdog function demands that the accountant maintain total independence from the client at all times and requires complete fidelity to the public trust.</blockquote>

465 U.S. at 817-18 (italics in original).<P>

The Court went on to state that the difference in the relationship required a different result:

<blockquote>To insulate from disclosure a certified public accountant's interpretations of the client's financial statements would be to ignore the significance of the accountant's role as a disinterested analyst charged with public obligations.</blockquote>

465 U.S. at 818.<P>

In <EM>Adlman</EM>, the government took the position that for non-audit services to avoid the result of <EM>Arthur Young</EM>, those services would have to be walled-off from the accounting firm's auditing functions.   At page 6 of its brief, the government stated as follows:

<blockquote>The listing of documents in AA's possession provided by <EM>Sequa</EM> reflects that no fewer than nine AA partners and associates worked on the transaction and assisted in providing tax advice.  JA 47-48.  <EM>Sequa</EM> claims that they all participated in helping <EM>Adlman</EM> render legal advice.  JA 48.  <strong>The listing does not indicate that these nine AA partners and associates were distinct from the accountants who performed audits of Sequa.</strong></blockquote>

(Bold added.)
<P>

And at page 11 of its brief, the government stated as follows:

<blockquote>Finally, [the AA representative] claimed that the memoranda are kept in a restricted file at the firm, b<STRONG>ut did not state that it was kept from AA personnel auditing Sequa or producing the firm's tax reserve analyseswork not subject to any evidentiary privilege.</STRONG>  JA 99.  
</blockquote>

(Bold added.)
<P>

Since <EM>Sequa</EM> bore the burden of proof on the privilege issue, the government argued that, by failing to establish that AA had walled-off its tax advice from its functions as an independent auditor, <EM>Sequa</EM> had failed to meet its burden of proof.
<P>

<EM>Adlman</EM> thus makes it clear that to be safe from a government challenge, the client (or lawyer) who engages the accounting firm to assist the lawyer should be assured that the accounting firm will wall-off its consulting for the lawyer from its independent auditing functions.

<blockquote><hr><strong>As a question of professional ethics, can an accounting firm wall-off its consulting services from its function as the independent auditor?</strong><hr></blockquote>

In its <EM>Adlman</EM> brief, the government implicitly assumed that an independent auditor can ethically wall-off its consulting services so that its auditing personnel cannot examine the conclusions of its consulting staff.  If that assumption turns out to be incorrect, however, the practical effect would be that the IRS can subpoena the results of all consulting services provided to a client by an accounting firm that also audits the client's financial statements. 
<P>

In many cases it may well be that the accounting firm cannot wall-off its consulting services.  Each state establishes a code of professional responsibility that applies to accountants practicing in that state.  However, the AICPA provides a nationwide code for its members.  The  AICPA rules provide as follows:

<blockquote><strong>
Article VI
<P>

Scope and Nature of Services</strong>
<P>

<EM>A member in public practice should observe the Principles of the Code of Professional Conduct in determining the scope and nature of services to be provided.</EM>
<P>

The public interest aspect of certified public accountants' services requires that such services be consistent with acceptable professional behavior for certified public accountants.  Integrity requires that service and the public trust not be subordinated to personal gain and advantage.  Objectivity and independence require that members be free from conflicts of interest in discharging professional responsibilities...
<P>

Each of these Principles should be considered by members in determining whether or not to provide specific services in individual circumstances.  In some instances, they may represent an overall constraint on the non-audit services that might be offered to a specific client.  No hard-and-fast rules can be developed to help members reach these judgments, but they must be satisfied that they are meeting the spirit of the Principles in this regard.
<P>

In order to accomplish this, members should . . .
<P>

<ul>
<li><strong>Determine</strong>, in their individual judgments, <strong>whether the scope and nature of other services provided to an audit client would create a conflict of interest in the performance of the audit function for that client.</strong>
</ul>

<center>* * * * *</center><p>

</blockquote>

(Bold added.)
<P>

Given this rule, it would seem that before awarding a consulting engagement to a firm that also audits its financial statements, a company (or better yet, the company's lawyer) should seek assurance from the auditing firm that the results of the consulting engagement will be walled-off from the firm's auditing staff.  Some accounting firms are willing to provide that assurancein writing.  Others are not.
<P>

<blockquote><hr><strong>If the auditing firm will not agree in advance to wall-off its        consulting services, consider  hiring a different firm.</strong><hr></blockquote>

In the context of consulting engagements that analyze potential defects in the company's employee benefits plans, some accounting firms are apparently unwilling to provide assurance that the consulting services will be walled-off.  If the auditing firm refuses to provide such assurance, the best response (given the large exposures that could potentially result if the IRS could subpoena the firm's consulting analysis) may be to engage a different firm. 
<P>

Even if a different firm is engaged, however, the firm that audits the company's financial statements might nevertheless effectively compel certain disclosures with respect to the plan defects that are discussed. For example, the auditing firm may learn of the other firm's analysis because it uncovers references to that analysis in other documents it examines in connection with its audit.  Or, the auditing firm may learn of the other firm's analysis from examining the billings that reference that work.  (Examining billings to determine whether questions related to plan defects have been examined by outside professionals is a standard audit technique.)
<P>

If the auditing firm learns of the existence of the other firm's analysis, it may demand to see that analysisunder the threat that, if it is not given access to the other firm's conclusions, it will issue a qualified opinion on the company's financial statements.
<P>

In our experience, if it gets to that point, the auditing firm will generally be satisfied if the potential defect is identified to itwithout providing to the auditing firm the risk analysis of the other firm.<p>

Disclosing even the existence of a defect to the auditing firm can be problematic.  It increases the chance that the IRS will discover the defect and discover that the employer knew of the defect.  And disclosure to the auditing firm might provide the IRS (or the DOL or a private litigant) with a basis to argue that the privilege has been waived as to the underlying analysis.  However, if the disclosure to the auditing firm is handled properly, the employer may be able to avoid a waiver.<p>

<h3><em>Executive Summary . . .</em><p></h3>
January 26, 1996:  The IRS announces a "deal killer" position <br>
on a popular executive perk:
<h3>
Equity Split Dollar Life Insurance.</h3><p>


<STRONG>Why equity split dollar has been popular for providing retirement benefits:</STRONG>  Since the mid-'60s, equity split dollar was thought to have a rather unique combination of advantages:

<OL>
<LI>During an executive's working career, assets could be accumulated (in the form of cash values) for the purpose of providing retirement benefits.  Those assets were beyond the reach of the employer's general creditors.
<LI>It was thought that the executive was not taxable during his/her working career on the assets as they accumulated.  At most, the executive was taxable only when he/she received payouts during his/her retirement years.  And with the creative use of policy loans he/she might not even be taxable in retirement.  
</OL>

	
<STRONG>On January 26, 1996, the IRS announced a deal killer position:</STRONG>  The IRS announced that an executive was taxable during his/her working career on the cash values as they accumulate.<P>

<STRONG>We do not expect most employers to collapse existing split dollar arrangements in the near term:</STRONG>  The insurance industry will fight the IRS position.  The industry is politically powerful and has some credible arguments that it can advance to either:

<OL>
<LI>Obtain a total reversal of the IRS position. 
<LI>Or at least limit the application of the IRS position to policies issued in the future.
</OL>


<STRONG>But some risk management issues need to be addressed immediately:</STRONG>  Even if the split dollar arrangements are not collapsed in the near term, the very existence of an officially announced, adverse IRS position will cause almost all employers to (re)evaluate certain issues.  These issues include:

<OL>
<LI>Does the IRS position clearly apply to the specific split dollar agreements currently in effect between the employer and its executives?  If yes, what changes in the split dollar arrangement could be made?
<LI>What is the past, current, and future income tax exposure of the executive and the income tax reporting and withholding exposure of the employer?  
<LI>Many employers will conclude that their executives should receive information about, and an evaluation of, the newly announced IRS position.  
<LI>Many employers will probably now have to decide whether the employer will provide the executive with a tax gross up should the IRS ultimately be able to sustain its position.  
<LI>What is the possible effect on other employee benefit plans?  Would the IRS position result in additional compensation to be recognized in determining benefits under the employer's plans?  Would the unexpected additional taxable income cause tax qualified pension and profit sharing plans to lose their tax favored status?
</OL>

<h3>Equity Split Dollar Life Insurance.</h3><BR>
By Hugh Forcier and Doug Heffernan<p>


Since the mid-'60s, equity split dollar life insurance arrangements have been considered by the insurance industry to have significant income tax and gift tax advantages.  The income tax advantages thought to be obtained when split dollar arrangements are used to provide retirement benefits to executives are briefly reviewed in the section beginning with the first link.

<A HREF="#positions">The IRS position made public on January 26, 1996:  TAM 9604001</A></h4>
<hr>

Since the mid-'80s, IRS staffers would occasionally make statements that indicated that they did not necessarily agree with the insurance industry's view.  However, over this long period the IRS never took any formal action to question the industry, that is, not until Technical Advice Memorandum (TAM) 9604001 (Sept. 8, 1995) was made available to the public on January 26, 1996.
<p>

Some employers and executives entered into these arrangements without knowing that there was any reason to question the tax advantages described by the industry.  Other employers and executives entered into the arrangements with the knowledge that some risk existedbut judged the potential rewards to be well worth the risks.<br>


<blockquote><hr><strong>The industry's historic view:    Equity split dollar permits assets to be dedicated during an executive's working career for the purpose of providing retirement benefits without any current income taxation.</strong><hr></blockquote>

As a general principle of tax law set out in Section 83 of the federal tax code, if assets are dedicated for retirement purposes (that is, placed beyond the reach of the employer's general creditors) the executive is currently taxed.  In other words, the executive is taxed on the dedicated assets as they are dedicated during his/her working careereven though he/she will not receive cash payment until his/her retirement years.  The only clear exceptions to this general principle under Section 83 are statutory planssuch as 401(a)/(k) tax qualified plans or 403(b) tax sheltered annuity arrangements.  
<p>

The consensus view of the insurance industry was that (even without a statutory exemption) assets could be accumulated under an equity split dollar arrangement that were dedicated to provide retirement benefits (i.e., protected from the employer's general creditors) and, at worst, the executive would not be taxable until he/she actually received cash payouts during retirement.  And, under some variations, the industry contended that (through the use of policy loans) he/she would not even be taxable when he/she receives cash payouts in retirement.
<br>

<blockquote><hr><strong>The risk was that the industry's consensus view was too good to be true.  But the IRS was aware of the industry's views and never officially challenged those views  that is, not until TAM 9604001.</strong><hr></blockquote>

For decades, the IRS was well aware of the industry's use of equity split dollar arrangements and of the industry's view that under such arrangements, assets could be dedicated for retirement programs without current taxation.  During that period the IRS never formally questioned the industry's position.
<p>

In 1988, the IRS specifically refused to rule on a rather typical equity split dollar arrangementstating that equity split dollar arrangements were the subject of a pending Revenue Ruling project.  However, a Revenue Ruling was never issued.
<p>

On January 26, 1996, the IRS TAM was made publicly available.  It announced a radically adverse IRS position with respect to equity split dollar.  (A Technical Advice Memorandum is formal written advice issued by the IRS National Office to IRS field auditors in connection with the examination of a specific taxpayer.  Although the TAM is technically applicable only to the specific taxpayer, TAMs reflect general IRS positions.)  The IRS position is described in the section beginning on page 5. 
<p>
 
In general terms, the IRS has taken the view that the executive is currently taxable on his/her equity in the cash value (i.e., the excess of the cash value over the cumulative employer premium payments) when, and as, the amounts become dedicated for the purpose of providing future retirement benefits.
<br>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Prediction:  Most employers and executives will not collapse arrangements in the near term.</strong><hr></blockquote>

The insurance industry will expend considerable effort seeking to overturn the IRS position.  The insurance industry is the most politically powerful financial services industry in the country.  And it is not without credible arguments.  For those reasons, it may well obtain a total reversal of the IRS position.  Even more probable is that the industry will be successful in preventing the IRS position from being applied to existing split dollar arrangements.  Employers and executives that accept this view (which we expect to be the majority) will not be inclined to collapse existing arrangements in the near term and will continue to claim the tax advantages.
<br>

<blockquote><hr><strong>But even if the arrangements are continued, the IRS position presents new risk management issues.</strong><hr></blockquote>

Even if the arrangements are not collapsed in the near term, the very existence of an officially announced, adverse IRS position will cause almost all employers to (re)evaluate certain issues.  These issues include:

<OL>
<LI>Does the IRS position clearly apply to the specific split dollar agreements currently in effect between the employer and its executives?  If yes, what changes could be made?
<LI>What is the past, current, and future income tax exposure of the executive and the income tax reporting and withholding exposure of the employer?  (Gift tax exposure must also be analyzed if an irrevocable trust established by the executive has an equity interest in the cash value of the policy.)
<LI>Many employers will conclude that their executives should receive information about, and an evaluation of, the newly announced IRS position.  
<LI>Many employers will probably now have to decide whether the employer will provide the executive with a tax gross up if the IRS should sustain its position as to existing and future split dollar arrangements.  
<LI>What is the possible effect on other employee benefit plans?  Would the IRS position result in additional compensation to be recognized in determining benefits under the employer's plans?  Or, under the TAM, would there be additional compensation to be recognized for discrimination testing purposes (under such tests as a 401(k) ADP test or a 401(a)(4) general test)?  For example, will some persons previously thought to be non-highly compensated employees now be highly compensated employees?  Or do some persons who would remain non-highly compensated persons in all events now have a lower benefit expressed as a percent of pay?  Either consequence could cause past or future 401(k) ADP tests or 401(a)(4) general tests to fail. 
</OL>


<A NAME="advantages"></A><H3>The income tax advantages when equity split dollar<BR>
insurance is used to provide retirement benefits for <BR>
executives  according to the historic, virtual <BR>
consensus view of the insurance industry</H3><BR>


Split dollar life insurance arrangements take many forms and can be used to achieve various objectives.  This area is further complicated by the fact that there is no standardized terminology.
<p>

However, equity split dollar is a term commonly used to refer to a broad class of split dollar arrangements.  Under these arrangements, the employer advances funds to purchase a cash value policy insuring the life of an executive and the incidents of ownership are divided (or split) between the executive and the employer.  
<p>

A cash value life insurance policy has two basic features:  A death benefit and a cash value.  If the employer retains all of the cash value and the executive only receives the right to have a death benefit paid to his/her beneficiary, the arrangement is usually called traditional split dollar.  If both the death benefit and the cash values are split, the arrangement is called equity split dollar.  Today, most split dollar arrangements are of the equity type.
<p>

Note:  Under both traditional and equity split dollar, it is universally accepted that the executive is subject to income tax each year on the value of the death benefit protection that has been provided by the employer during the year for the executive's beneficiaries.  The taxable benefit is measured by what would have been the cost of providing a like amount of term insurance coverage.  For more information on this aspect of split dollar, see the box on this page.


<blockquote><hr><strong>Income tax advantages in the  retirement context.</strong><hr></blockquote>

Equity split dollar is frequently used to provide retirement benefits.  Usually, the employer pays all of the premiums and the employer's share of the cash value is limited to the cumulative amount of the premiums it has paid (i.e., with no adjustment for earnings). 
<p>

Under this type of arrangement, during an executive's working career assets are being dedicated to provide for income during his/her retirement years.  The assets are being dedicated as the cash value accumulates above the cumulative amount of the employer's premium payments.  
<p>

The respective interests of the employer and executive can be secured in one of two ways:

<OL>
<LI><em>Endorsement method:</em>  The employer is the owner of the policy but the policy is endorsed by the insurance company to reflect the interest the employee has in the policy proceeds as set out in the split dollar agreement.
<LI><em>Collateral assignment method:</em>  The executive is the owner of the policy but an assignment filed with the insurance company recognizes that the employer has rights in the insurance proceeds pursuant to the split dollar agreement.
</OL>

In both cases, the interest of the executive in the cash value is beyond the reach of the employer's general creditors.
<P>

During the executive's retirement years, the employer's cumulative premiums can be left in the policy and the executive can be permitted to make withdrawals from the cash value to provide retirement incomeso long as the withdrawals do not bring the cash value below the amount of the employer's cumulative premium payments.
<P>


<blockquote><hr><center><h3>How is the taxable value of<br>
the death benefit protection<br>
calculated?</h3></center>

Under IRS authority, the taxable value of the death protection is calculated by<br>
multiplying the amount of protection provided by the lower of two rates:

<OL>
<LI>The P.S. 58/38 rates:  This is a rate (based on the insured's age) that<br>
provides a value per $1,000 of coverage.
<LI>The rate per $1,000 of coverage charged by the insurance company for term<br>
insurance.
</OL>

At least at some insurance companies, the practice of using the rates for desk drawer term insurance has evolved.  Desk drawer term insurance means a term insurance policy that the insurance company has developed with extraordinarily low premium ratesand which, as a practical matter, the insurance company never actually offers to sell to anyone.
<hr></blockquote>

The income tax advantages that historically have been thought to exist are substantial:  From the executive's perspective, he/she is not subject to any income tax until he/she begins to withdraw amounts during retirement.  At worst, withdrawals would be taxable when received.  The P.S. 58/38 costs (see box) might constitute basis, permitting some withdrawals to be received tax-free. And if the executive makes withdrawals in the form of tax-free policy loans, and if he/she
 dies before the policy must be surrendered, all income tax would be avoidedboth with respect to the amounts withdrawn by the executive and with respect to the death benefit paid to the executive's beneficiaries.  The industry's view on the issue was well stated in a newsletter published in 1992 by Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company.  See box on page 4.<br>

<blockquote><hr><strong>A rollout at retirement is common.</strong><hr></blockquote>

Under some of the most common variations of equity split dollar, the split dollar arrangement ends when the executive retires, even though the life insurance policy may continue.  This is called a rollout.  There are many variations of rollouts.  Sometimes the employer receives a return of its cumulative premium payments.
<p>

Other times, the employer simply foregoes its right to receive its cumulative premium payments at the executive's retirement, and the employer's interest is rolled out to the executive.  If that happens, it is generally accepted that the executive is taxable on that amount at that time.  
<p>

Some commentators have expressed concern that (at least if the endorsement method is used) the executive may be taxable on his/her split of cash values at the time of a rollout (in addition to the clear consequence that he/she is taxable on the portion of the employer's split that the employer may have foregone as described in the preceding paragraph).
<p>


<blockquote><hr><center><strong>The virtual consensus view of the insurance industry.</strong></center>
<p>

As described in the section beginning on page 5, the IRS has taken the position that the executive is taxable during his/her working career as his/her split of cash value increases.  Historically, the insurance industry has not thought this result to be likely.  One of the clearest statements of the industry's view was set out in the April 1992 issue of Connecticut Mutual's <EM>The Advanced Underwriter</EM> at page 6 (italics added):
<p>

Because equity plans differ from traditional split-dollar plans and because there are no cases or official IRS rulings directly on point regarding equity split-dollar, the income tax treatment becomes uncertain as the employee's equity arises (when the cash surrender value exceeds the cumulative employer premiums).  This uncertainty relates to whether and when the equity in the policy is taxed to the employee.  <strong><em>It is the virtual consensus in the insurance industry that the employee is taxed just as in the traditional split-dollar plan</em></strong>, pursuant to the principles of Revenue Rulings 64-328 and 66-110, based on the economic value of the death benefit.  <em>This means that the employee is not taxed on the equity build up while the plan is in effect</em>.
<p>

A minority view is that an equity split-dollar plan is a departure from the situation described in Revenue Ruling 64-328 and that the IRS would perhaps include in the employee's income the increase in cash value each year, or a portion of the gross premium of the policy, or the IRS might apply Section 7872 dealing with below market interest loans.
<hr></blockquote>


<A NAME="positions"></A><H3>The IRS position made public<br>
on January 26, 1996:  TAM 9604001.</H3>

In general terms, the IRS basic position publicly announced on January 26, 1996 is easy to understand:

<blockquote>[U]nder sections 61 and 83 of the Code, Taxpayer must include in income each year that the [split dollar] arrangement is in force (a) an amount equal to the one-year term cost of declining life insurance and (b) any cash surrender buildup in the policies that exceeds the amount that is returnable to [the employer] when the arrangement is discontinued.
</blockquote>

TAM 9604001.


<blockquote><hr><strong>Literal application of IRS position makes no sense.</strong><hr></blockquote>

Read literally, the IRS position leads to double taxation.  Each year the executive's taxable income under Section 83 would be calculated as follows:
<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>The cash value at the end of the year
<p>
MINUS
<p>
<li>The employer's cumulative premiums (assumed to be returnable to it under the terms of the split dollar agreement).
<li>But never less than $0.
</ul>

This interpretation, however, by focusing on the entire cash value rather than increases in cash value, would result in repetitive taxation of amounts previously taken into income.  Over the life of a split dollar arrangement, this would result in taxable income many times greater than the cash value interest of the executive.
<p>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Presumably, the executive would at least be entitled to an offset to avoid double taxation.</strong><hr></blockquote>

Although not expressed in the TAM, the IRS presumably would permit the executive to claim an offset for amounts previously taken into income.  The formula to calculate each year's taxable income would be as follows:
<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>The cash value at the end of the taxable year.
<p>
MINUS
<p>
<li>The employer's cumulative premiums paid at the end of the current year.
<li>Less the amount of cash values that the executive had included in taxable income in prior years.
<li>But never less than $0.
</ul>

However, even this method would not allow the executive to gain the advantage of his or her cost basis normally associated with cash value policies.  That is, the increase in cash value (earnings) attributable to amounts previously recognized as income by the executive would be taxed currently even though such amounts would not be taxed currently if the executive had paid that part of the premium directly.
<p>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Further refinements under section 83 would seem to be necessary.</strong><hr></blockquote>

The IRS position announced in the TAM is based on an underlying theory that something of value is being transferred to the executive under equity split dollar arrangements.  The IRS has focused on the increase in cash surrender value as the event resulting in taxable income.  To make this theory better conform to economic reality, the IRS position should be modified to treat only the earnings (reflected in the increase in cash value) <em>attributable to the employer's premiums</em> as being transferred to the executive each year after the cash value exceeds cumulative employer premiums.  However, several amounts should not be viewed as being transferred by the employer to the executive, and therefore should not be taxable currently: 

<ul type=square>
<li>Amounts already taken into income by the executive in prior years.

<li>Earnings (reflected in the increase in cash value) attributable to amounts already taken into income by the executive.

<li>Increases occurring after rollout.
</ul>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Or the IRS might shift to an interest-free loan theory.</strong><hr></blockquote>

Alternatively, the typical equity split dollar arrangement could be viewed as an interest free loan to the executive equal to the cumulative amount of premiums paid by the employer.  Arguably, the IRS rejected the interest-free loan theory in 1964.  However, as the debates progress, the IRS might be forced to adopt that theory as best reflecting economic substance.  
<p>

An interest-free loan theory, if applied, would result in a different amount of taxable income:

<ul type=square>
<li>Presumably the value of the interest-free loan would be includable in the executive's income even in the early years of the arrangement when the executive has no equity in the cash values.
<li>In the later years of the arrangement, the executive would probably have less taxable income than he/she would under TAM 9604001.  This is because the actual return on the cash values would likely exceed the imputed interest on the loan from the employer.
<br>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Other unresolved questions.</strong><hr></blockquote>

A number of other questions come to mind.  For example, how would policy loans be treated under the TAM?  If they are viewed as a reduction in cash values, would an executive escape taxation by borrowing the cash value?  Presumably not, but the IRS TAM provides no clear guidance. 
<p>

Another question is whether taxable income would continue to be calculated under the TAM after a rollout has occurred.  Presumably there would be no taxation under the TAM after the rollout because the arrangement is no longer in force.  But the TAM does not specifically address this question.
<p>

Also, how would the IRS position be applied in the case of a variable life policy where a significant investment loss could be sustained?  Presumably, under the IRS position there would be no taxable income in the year of a decrease in cash value due to investment loss.  Some observers might conclude that the executive should be entitled to a loss deduction equal to the decrease in cash value previously taken into income.
<br>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Conclusions.</strong><hr></blockquote>

These and other unresolved questions will provide a basis for the insurance industry to attack the logic of TAM 9604001.  In the end, it would seem that to be on an intellectually sound basis and to be able to impose any current taxation, the IRS will have to adopt a position that more closely recognizes the economic substance of the transaction.  
<p>

Unless the IRS begins to more closely recognize the economic substance of the transaction, there is a good chance that the insurance industry will be able to obtain a reversal of the IRS position. 
<p>

<H3>TO:	Our Employee Benefits and Employment Law Clients and Friends
RE:  Proposed IRS Regulations on Plan Loans
</H3>

The IRS recently issued proposed regulations regarding loans to participants and beneficiaries from employee benefit plans, including 401(k), profit sharing, money purchase, and 403(b) plans.  The proposed regulations describe the requirements for a plan loan and the tax and reporting consequences triggered by failure to satisfy those requirements.  This letter summarizes the key aspects of the proposed regulations.

<H3>I.   REQUIREMENTS FOR A LOAN
</H3>

<STRONG>Enforceable agreement.</STRONG>  The proposed regulations state that a plan loan must be evidenced by an enforceable agreement that specifies the amount of the loan, the term of the loan, and the repayment schedule.  The agreement can be set forth in more than one document, and can be in writing or in another form that is approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.  This latter provision leaves open the possibility that the IRS will eventually approve paperless loans, such as purely electronic or voice-response loan transactions.  However, for the present, truly paperless loans apparently will not be allowed.<P>

<STRONG>Amount of loan.</STRONG>  In general, the total amount of a participant's outstanding loans on the date a loan is made cannot exceed the lesser of $50,000  reduced by any loan principal repaid within the last 12 months  or 50% of the participant's vested benefit.  The proposed regulations simply note that the loan must satisfy these Internal Revenue Code limits and that the amount of the loan must be set out in the agreement.<P>

<STRONG>Term of loan.</STRONG>  The Code provides that the term of a plan loan cannot exceed five years, unless the loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit which will within a reasonable time be used as the principal residence of the participant.  The proposed regulations define principal residence by reference to the tax rules regarding rollover of a gain on the sale of a principal residence.  They also allow the use of  tracing rules to determine whether the proceeds of a plan loan were used to acquire a principal residence.  For example, if the participant borrows money from a bank to acquire his or her principal residence, and shortly thereafter obtains a plan loan to pay off the bank loan, under the tracing rules the plan loan will be treated as having been used to acquire the residence.  (The proposed regulations also note that, as a general rule, loan refinancings do not qualify as principal residence loans.)<P>

<STRONG>Repayment schedule.</STRONG>  The Code requires that a loan be repaid in substantially equal installments, not less frequently than quarterly, over the term of the loan.  The proposed regulations allow (but do not require) the plan to suspend loan repayments during a participant's unpaid leave of absence of up to one year.  If the participant takes a paid leave, loan repayments may be suspended only if the participant's pay (after tax withholding) is not sufficient to cover the loan payments.  The loan must in any event be repaid in full by the latest date permitted under the Code (i.e., the five-year or principal residence rule).<P>

For example, assume a participant is obligated to make loan payments of $825 a month for five years on a loan that is not a principal residence loan.  Assume also that the participant makes several monthly payments and then takes an unpaid leave of absence for one year.  The proposed regulations state that the plan can suspend the participant's monthly loan payments during the leave.  When the participant returns, the plan can either (1) increase the remaining monthly payments to make up for the missed payments, or (2) allow the participant to continue paying $825 a month, with a balloon payment at the end of the original five-year term.  Because the loan is not a principal residence loan, however, the maximum term of the loan cannot be extended beyond five years.  (The examples in the proposed regulations indicate that the increased periodic payments or the balloon payment would have to include accrued interest on the payments missed during the leave period.)  

<H3>II.   CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO SATISFY LOAN REQUIREMENTS
</H3>

Failure to comply with the IRS loan requirements means that the loan will be treated as a deemed distribution from the plan.  This results in adverse tax consequences for the participant and imposes reporting and possibly withholding requirements on the plan administrator.<P>

Tax consequences of a deemed distribution.  A deemed distribution is treated as an actual distribution for the following federal income tax purposes:

<UL>
<LI>Ordinary income tax.
<LI>The 10% excise tax on premature distributions (generally distributions that are made before the participant reaches age 59½).
<LI>The 15% excise tax on excess distributions from qualified plans (in 1996, distributions which exceed $155,000 during the calendar year).
</UL>


A deemed distribution is not eligible for rollover or income-averaging treatment.<P>

It is important to note that a deemed distribution is not an actual distribution from the plan and does not terminate the underlying loan.  Virtually all plans require a participant to pledge his or her plan account as security for the loan.  When the loan goes into default, however, the plan cannot foreclose on the participant's account until the participant becomes entitled to a distribution from the plan.  At that point, either the note is included as part of the distribution to the participant, or the distribution is offset by the outstanding amount of the loan.<P>

<STRONG>Time and amount of the deemed distribution.</STRONG>  The proposed regulations state that a deemed distribution occurs at the time the requirements for a loan are not satisfied.  If a loan exceeds the Code limits on the amount of a loan, the excess is a deemed distribution.  If a loan does not satisfy the other IRS requirements when made, the deemed distribution is generally the full amount of the loan.  <P>

If the loan calls for monthly payments and the participant misses a monthly payment, the deemed distribution would ordinarily occur when the loan payment is missed.  However, the proposed regulations allow the plan to treat the deemed distribution as occurring at the end of any grace period the plan provides for making loan payments, as long as the grace period does not extend beyond the last day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the missed payment was due.  The amount of the deemed distribution is the entire outstanding balance of the loan on the last day payment was due (including interest that accrued during any grace period), not just the amount of the missed payment. <P>

As noted previously, a deemed distribution does not terminate the loan.  Plan administrators frequently ask whether a plan loan that goes into default continues to accrue interest and, if so, whether the unpaid interest that accrues each year results in additional deemed distributions to the participant.  The proposed regulations do not answer this question.  We called the IRS, and an IRS representative indicated that the regulations are silent because there is a difference of opinion within the IRS on the correct answer to this issue.<P>

<STRONG>Reporting.</STRONG>  A deemed distribution is a taxable distribution and must be reported on Form 1099-R.<P>

<STRONG>Withholding.</STRONG>  If a participant defaults on a loan and a deemed distribution results, no withholding is required because no money changes hands at that point.  If a loan is a deemed distribution when made (for example, if it exceeds the five year limit and is not a principal residence loan, or if it calls for annual rather than quarterly payments), then the loan proceeds are subject to the withholding rules for distributions that are not eligible rollover distributions.  The withholding rate would be the 10% rate for non-periodic distributions.  However, the participant can elect to waive the 10% withholding.<P>

<STRONG>Interplay with DOL loan regulations.</STRONG>  In 1989, the Department of Labor issued its own set of regulations governing loans from retirement plans.  Those regulations set out the requirements necessary for a loan to be exempt from ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions.  You should keep in mind that most plans need to comply with both the DOL and IRS regulations.<P>

The IRS regulations discussed above are only proposed regulations.  However, if your plan permits loans to participants, you may want to amend your loan procedures and your note form to take advantage of some of the rules provided in the proposed regulations (such as the grace period).  If you wish to submit comments on the proposed regulations, the deadline is March 20, 1996.<P>

<H3>TO:	Our Employee Benefits and Employment Law Clients and Friends<P>
RE:  Proposed DOL Regulations Regarding Participant Contributions</h3>



The Department of Labor (DOL) recently released proposed regulations that would revise the rules regarding when participant contributions to an employer sponsored pension or welfare benefit plan become plan assets for purposes of various ERISA rules.  (Under the DOL's interpretation, participant contributions include pre-tax salary reduction contributions to a 401(k) plan or to a health plan through a cafeteria plan arrangement.)  Because of the ERISA fiduciary duty and prohibited transaction rules regarding plan assets, and the ERISA requirement that plan assets must be held in trust (subject to certain exceptions), the proposed regulations could require significant changes in the administration of many plans.<P>

Under current DOL Regulations, participant contributions become plan assets as of the earliest date the contributions can reasonably be segregated from the employer's general assets, but in no event later than 90 days from the date the contributions are received by the employer (e.g., by withholding them from the employee's pay).  The DOL believes that a number of abuses have occurred because employers are violating this rule, at least in part because some employers are under the mistaken impression that the 90 day rule is a safe-harbor.  The proposed regulations would shorten the 90-day outer limit so that the DOL and plan participants can more quickly and easily determine that a violation has occurred.  (Participant contributions would continue to become plan assets as soon as they can reasonably be segregated from the employer's assets if that is earlier than the new outer limit rule described below.)<P>

Under the proposed regulations, participant contributions would become plan assets within the same time frame that the employer is required to segregate and deposit withheld income and employment taxes.  This period is measured from the date such amounts are received by the employer or otherwise would have been payable to the participant in cash (if withheld from pay).  The outer limit would depend on the amount of the employer's withheld income taxes and employment taxes:

<UL>
<LI>If an employer has accumulated $100,000 or more of federal income, Social Security, and Medicare taxes on any date, participant contributions would become plan assets on the next banking day after they are made.  (The DOL specifically invited comments on whether this time frame is appropriate for the regulations.)
<LI>If an employer reported more than $50,000 of federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes for the 12-month period ending on the previous June 30,  the employer is a semi-weekly depositor.  Under the semi-weekly depositor rules, participant contributions made on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday would become plan assets no later than the following Wednesday.  Participant contributions made on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday would become plan assets no later than the following Friday.
<LI>If an employer reported $50,000 or less of federal income, Social Security, and Medicare taxes for the 12-month period ending on the previous June 30, the employer is a monthly depositor.  Under the monthly depositor rules, participant contributions made in any calendar month would become plan assets no later than the 15th day of the following month.
</UL>

Absent an applicable exception, plan assets must be held in trust.  Under the proposed regulations, this means that, in general, participant contributions to a retirement plan, health plan, or other welfare benefit plan must be deposited in an ERISA trust, used to pay insurance premiums, or used to pay plan benefits or expenses no later than the time frame described above.  While the preamble to the proposed regulations note that the DOL has previously announced that it will not assert a violation of the ERISA trust requirement in connection with cafeteria plans solely because of the failure to hold participant contributions in trust, it is not clear how long that DOL position will last if the proposed regulations become final.  In any event, it is likely that many health plans would be affected by the proposed regulations, notwithstanding the DOL position regarding cafeteria plans, because the proposed regulations specifically indicate that COBRA premium payments by former employees are subject to the participant contribution plan asset rules.<P>

The DOL has specifically requested comments from employers on whether the proposed regulations would impose an undue burden on plan sponsors.  Written comments must be received by the DOL by February 5, 1996.  A public hearing on the proposed regulations is scheduled to be held February 22, 1996.<P>

The DOL expects to issue final regulations 45 days after the close of the comment period.  As proposed, the regulation would be effective 60 days after a final regulation is published.  This means that final regulations could be effective as early as late May of 1996.  For plan sponsors for whom the revised regulations would require significant changes in plan administration, it may be appropriate to start considering now the potential impact and the feasibility of making changes to comply with the regulations.<P>

<H3>TO:	Our Employee Benefits and Employment Law Clients and Friends<P>
RE:  Application of the Family and Medical Leave Act to Cafeteria Plans;<br> Applicable Premiums under COBRA</h3>



The Internal Revenue Service recently issued proposed regulations which discuss the effect the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) has on cafeteria plans.  The IRS also recently issued guidance on determining the applicable premium for COBRA health continuation coverage.  This letter describes the proposed cafeteria plan regulations and guidance on COBRA premiums and offers suggestions on how to deal with these issues.

<H3>I.  FMLA AND CAFETERIA PLANS</H3>

<STRONG>Elections.</STRONG>  According to the proposed regulations, an employee who takes FMLA leave has the right to revoke his or her election of group health plan coverage for the remainder of the coverage period.  Upon returning from FMLA leave, the employee must be allowed to reinstate coverage if he or she desires, whether coverage terminated because of revocation or nonpayment of contributions.  The employee's ability to revoke and reinstate also applies to coverage under a health care flexible spending arrangement (FSA).  An employer cannot require an employee to revoke or reinstate coverage.<p>

An employee on FMLA leave can also change his or her cafeteria plan election the same as employees who are not on FMLA leave (e.g., because of a change in family status).  For example, because returning from an unpaid leave normally is a change in family status under a cafeteria plan that allows a change in elections, an employee returning from unpaid FMLA leave could decide to change the amount of coverage elected, as well as reinstate coverage if coverage was revoked during the FMLA leave.<p>

These rules present the possibility that an employee could use the entire amount of elected coverage under a health FSA early in the year, take FMLA leave and revoke coverage, return to work, and decide not to continue coverage under the health FSA, leaving the employer with the bill.  (A similar result could happen automatically if the FMLA leave overlaps the end of a plan year.)  The proposed regulations do not address this issue.  Employers may wish to adjust the maximum amount of coverage allowed under a health FSA to reduce the likelihood of large abuses.  The cafeteria plan rules for changes of elections due to changes in family status should also be reviewed to assure they provide the best result possible.<p>

<STRONG>Payment Options.</STRONG>  Employees who elect to continue coverage during FMLA leave are responsible for the premiums and other contributions they were paying while working.  The proposed regulations give three methods that can be used to make these payments:

<OL>
<LI><U>Pre-pay.</U>  A cafeteria plan may permit (but not require) the employee to pay, prior to the beginning of the leave, the amount due for health plan coverage during the portion of FMLA leave that falls in the remainder of the plan year.  These amounts may be paid on a pre-tax salary reduction basis from any taxable compensation (including unused sick days or vacation days) owed to the employee.  Contributions under this option may also be made on an after-tax basis.
<LI><U>Pay-as-you-go.</U>  Under this option, the employee can make payments on the same schedule as payments would be made if the employee were not on leave.  Payments can also be made under other schedules permitted by the FMLA regulations (e.g., the schedule for premium payments under COBRA).  Such payments are generally made on an after-tax basis, but they may be made on a pre-tax basis to the extent the employee has taxable compensation during the leave (such as cashing out unused sick days and vacation days).
<LI><U>Catch-up.</U>  Under the catch-up method, the employer and employee agree that the employer will make the payments on the employee's behalf during the FMLA leave, and that the employee will repay the employer (on either a pre- or after-tax basis) when the employee returns from FMLA leave.  This option may be unattractive to employers, depending upon the number of individuals who do not return after FMLA leave, and therefore never catch-up.
</OL>


There are some restrictions on which options can be offered.  The pre-pay option cannot be the only option offered.  The catch-up option cannot be the only option offered unless it is the only option offered to employees on non-FMLA leave without pay.  Similarly, the pay-as-you-go option must be offered to employees on FMLA leave if it is offered to employees on non-FMLA leave without pay.  If the employee is on paid FMLA leave, the employee's payments must be made by the method normally used during other paid leave.  The proposed regulations also state that the employer may waive employee payments during FMLA leave on a nondiscriminatory basis.<P>

If the FMLA leave extends into a second cafeteria plan year, employees cannot be allowed to prepay premiums on a pre-tax basis for the second year.  For example, if a cafeteria plan runs on the calendar year, an employee beginning FMLA leave in November can prepay for November and December on a pre-tax basis, but cannot prepay for January on a pre-tax basis.  Instead, the employees would have to use another payment option for January, or prepay for January on an after-tax basis.<P>

<STRONG>Health Care Flexible Spending Arrangements.</STRONG>  Additional rules apply to coverage under a health FSA.  As long as an employee continues coverage under a health FSA, the full amount, less any prior reimbursements, must be available to the employee at all times.  If coverage under a health FSA terminates during FMLA leave, the employee cannot be reimbursed for claims incurred during the period when coverage is terminated.  If such an employee elects to be reinstated upon return from FMLA leave, the employee's coverage is equal to the employee's election for the 12-month period of coverage, prorated for the period of FMLA leave during which no payments were made, and reduced by prior reimbursements.<P>

For example, assume an employee elects $1,200 of coverage for the year, pays premiums of $100 in January and February through pre-tax salary reduction, and takes FMLA leave for March and April, during which coverage is cancelled under the health FSA.  The employee also receives reimbursement for $200 of medical expenses incurred in February.  Upon returning in May, if the employee elects to reinstate coverage under the health FSA, the initial election of $1,200 would be prorated to $1,000 to account for the two months of FMLA leave during which payments were not made.  That amount is further reduced by the reimbursement of $200, leaving the employee with $800 of coverage for the rest of the year and a $100 per month payment.<P>

<STRONG>Non-health Benefits.</STRONG>  FMLA does not require employers to maintain an employee's non-health benefits, such as a dependent care FSA, during FMLA leave.  An employee's right to such benefits (and the right to revoke an election for such benefits) under a cafeteria plan during FMLA leave would be the same as for an employee who is on non-FMLA leave (paid or unpaid).  If coverage for such benefits terminates during the FMLA leave, the employee must be permitted to reinstate coverage upon return.

<H3>II.  APPLICABLE PREMIUMS UNDER COBRA</H3> 

The IRS has also issued a Revenue Ruling on determining the applicable premium for COBRA health continuation coverage.  A plan may charge individuals who continue health care coverage under COBRA up to 102% of the applicable premium.  Applicable premium is defined as the cost to the plan for that period of coverage for similarly-situated beneficiaries who have not experienced a qualifying event entitling them to elect COBRA coverage.<p>

The Revenue Ruling gives examples of the applicable premiums where a plan uses insurance to provide benefits to employees and their dependents and charges either an individual rate (for the employee only) or a family rate (for the employee and his or her dependents).  According to the IRS guidance, the applicable premium in this situation depends on the number of individuals continuing coverage under COBRA, rather than whether the employee is the one who continues coverage.  For example, if an employee with family coverage experiences a qualifying event and elects to continue coverage, the applicable premium would be the family rate if two or more members of the family continue coverage.  However, if only one family member elects to continue coverage, the applicable premium is the individual rate, regardless of whether the individual continuing coverage is the employee, and regardless of whether the insurance company charges the plan the family rate for coverage of an individual other than the employee.<p>

The examples also show that a plan may charge the family rate to two family members who lost coverage because of the same qualifying event, even though individual coverage for each member may be less expensive.  For example, assume the individual rate is $150 per month and the family rate is $400 per month.  If an employee with family coverage for the employee and his or her spouse loses coverage and elects COBRA continuation coverage, the plan can charge the employee and spouse $400 per month for family coverage; it is not limited to charging $300 for two individual rates of coverage.<p>

Although the ruling does not directly address the issue, one could infer that the individual rate could be charged to one family member who elects continuation coverage while other family members who have not had a COBRA qualifying event continue family coverage.  For example, if a divorced employee carries dependent children under the employee's family coverage, but the employee's former spouse elects COBRA coverage, the applicable premium for the former spouse would presumably be the individual rate.

<H3>TO:	Our Employee Benefits and Employment Law Clients and Friends<P>
RE:  FICA Taxation of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation</h3>



The IRS recently proposed regulations concerning FICA taxes on amounts deferred under nonqualified deferred compensation plans.  As discussed in our November 9, 1994 letter on this topic, the FICA tax rule is significant because the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 removed the cap on wages that are taken into account for the Medicare portion of FICA tax (1.45% for both the employer and employee).  As a result, even though wages exceeding the wage base ($61,200 for 1995 and $62,700 for 1996) are not subject to the old-age, survivor and disability insurance (OASDI) portion of FICA tax, <STRONG>all</STRONG> wages (even those above the wage base) are subject to the Medicare portion of FICA tax.<P>

<STRONG>Timing of FICA Taxes on Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.</STRONG>  Under Section 3121(v)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, amounts credited to an employee under certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans will be taken into account as FICA wages as of the later of (i) when the services giving rise to the deferred compensation are performed, or (ii) when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the employee's right to the payment.  This means that FICA taxes are payable as the deferred compensation <STRONG>accrues</STRONG> (or vests, if later), even though income taxes may not be owed until the deferred amounts are actually paid to the employee.  (A similar rule applies to the federal unemployment tax (FUTA), but it is seldom significant for deferred compensation arrangements because most employees receive cash compensation in excess of the $7,000 FUTA wage base.)<P>

Any deferred compensation is taken into account for FICA taxes only once.  If a deferred amount is taken into account under the special timing rule in the previous paragraph, then neither that amount nor any income attributable to it will be treated as FICA wages at any time in the future.<P>

The proposed regulations provide details for applying the statutory requirements.  In addition to offering guidance on what types of plans actually provide for the deferral of compensation, the proposed regulations permit the use of reasonable assumptions in determining the present value of deferred compensation, establish when deferred compensation is reasonably ascertainable, give employers some flexibility in withholding FICA taxes from deferred compensation, and provide good faith transition rules.<p>

<strong>Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.</strong>  Under the proposed regulations, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is any plan established and maintained by an employer which provides for the deferral of compensation.  An amount deferred may not be taken into account as FICA wages before the plan (or any amendment increasing deferral amount) is established.  This occurs on the latest of the date on which it is adopted, the date on which it is effective, or the date on which the material terms (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the amount of deferred compensation and when that amount will be paid) are set forth in writing.  A deferral of compensation occurs when an employee has a legally binding right during a calendar year to compensation that has not been actually or constructively received and that is payable in a later year, notwithstanding that the right is subject to a vesting requirement or other contingencies.  The regulations specifically discuss the following types of plans:

<ul type=square>
<li><strong>Short-term deferrals.</strong>  If an amount is deferred to a date that is no more than a brief period of time after the end of the calendar year in which the amount was earned (up to 2½ months), the employer is not required to treat that amount as deferred compensation.
<P>
<li><strong>Stock options and stock appreciation rights.</strong>  An amount received as a stock value right is not deferred compensation and therefore is subject to FICA tax only when the right is actually exercised.  The regulations define a stock value right as a right granted to an employee with respect to employer stock that, when exercised, entitles the employee to a payment equal to the excess (or a percentage of the excess) of the value of the share on the date of exercise over a specified price.  Stock options and stock appreciation rights are examples of stock value rights.  Thus, a stock option is not considered deferred compensation and is subject to FICA tax when the option is exercised, rather than when it is granted.  
<P>
<li><strong>Phantom stock.</strong>  On the other hand, deferred compensation does include an award under a phantom stock plan, which typically is equal to the full fair market value of a specific number of shares of employer stock, as opposed to an award equal to the excess of that fair market value over a specified price.  Thus, a phantom stock plan does provide deferred compensation, and FICA tax is due each year when an amount is credited to the employee.
<P>
<li><strong>Restricted stock.</strong>  There is no deferral of compensation merely because the value of restricted property or stock is not includible in income in the year of receipt by reason of the property or stock being nontransferable and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  Thus, an award of restricted stock is not subject to FICA tax in the year of the award but rather when the stock is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
<P>
<li><strong>Welfare benefits and severance pay.</strong>  The regulations make clear that certain welfare benefits, including severance pay, vacation benefits, sick leave, disability pay, and death benefits are not considered deferred compensation and are not subject to the special timing rule.  A plan is deemed to provide severance pay if (i) the payments are not contingent upon the employee's retirement, (ii) the total amount of such payments does not exceed the equivalent of twice the employee's most recent annual compensation, and (iii) all such payments are completed within 24 months.  Termination plans not meeting these requirements may provide severance pay, depending upon the relevant facts and circumstances.  Any payment will be considered severance pay if it is available only upon the employee's involuntary termination.  
<P>
<li><strong>Benefits provided in contemplation of termination.</strong>  Benefits provided in connection with impending termination of employment are not deferred compensation.  These include window benefits (<EM>e.g.</EM>, early retirement benefits, retirement-type subsidies, and social security supplements) and plans where the employee terminates employment within 12 months of the establishment of the plan and the facts and circumstances indicate that the plan was established in contemplation of such termination.
<P>
<li><strong>Golden parachutes.</strong>  The special timing rule does not apply to golden parachute plans.
</ul>

<STRONG>Determining the amount deferred.</STRONG>  The regulations divide nonqualified deferred compensation plans into account balance plans and nonaccount balance plans.  For account balance plans, where deferrals and income on those deferrals are credited to the employee's individual account, the amount deferred which is subject to FICA tax equals the principal amount credited to the account.  Reasonable income attributable to amounts on which FICA tax was already paid is not considered deferred compensation and is not subject to FICA tax.  If, however, an unreasonable rate of interest or other index is used to determine income, then the income attributable to the principal amount is limited to the income that would result from applying the mid-term applicable federal rate.  Any income in excess of reasonable income will be considered deferred compensation (and subject to FICA tax) in the year it is credited to the account.<p>

For nonaccount balance plans, which are defined benefit-type plans, the amount deferred for a period equals the present value of the additional future payments to which the employee has obtained a legally binding right during that period.  Employers may use any reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods to determine the present value of these benefits.  Again, reasonable income on accruals under nonaccount balance plans that were previously included as FICA wages will not be subject to FICA tax when received.<p>

<STRONG>Amounts not reasonably ascertainable.</STRONG>  The regulations allow the employer to delay when a deferred amount is taken into account as FICA wages if any portion of the amount deferred is not reasonably ascertainable.  The amount of deferred compensation in a nonaccount balance plan may fluctuate depending on changes in contribution limits for qualified plans, the amount of the employee's future compensation, the date on which payments commence, or the form of benefit elected by the employee.  Deferred compensation subject to such contingencies becomes reasonably ascertainable only when no actuarial or other assumptions, other than interest, mortality, and cost-of-living assumptions, are needed to determine the amount deferred.  On the resolution date, the date when all contingencies have been determined and only interest, mortality, and cost-of-living adjustments need to be assumed, the present value of the amount calculated to be deferred must be taken into account as FICA wages.<p>

Employers have the option of estimating the eventual amount of the deferred compensation and taking it into account on an early inclusion date.  (One might wish to do this to avoid FICA taxes on the income of the deferrals.)  In this case, however, adjustments must be made later if the estimate is not accurate.<p>

<STRONG>Withholding.</STRONG>  Employers are required to withhold FICA tax from nonqualified deferred compensation only once a year, but may withhold more often.  If an amount cannot be calculated by the last day of the year, the employer may use an estimated method or a lag method to withhold FICA tax.  Under the estimated method, the employer simply takes an estimate of the deferred compensation into account as FICA wages for the year and makes adjustments later.  Under the lag method, the employer calculates the total deferred in the previous year and treats that amount as FICA wages in the first quarter of the next year.<P>

<STRONG>Transition rules.</STRONG>  The proposed regulations state that they will be in effect for compensation deferred on or after January 1, 1997.  For amounts deferred before 1997, an employer may operate under any reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 3121(v).  Four specific transition rules cover situations where compensation was mistakenly treated as deferred or not deferred or where the amount of deferred compensation actually paid to an employee on a later date was miscalculated.  The IRS generally allows a claim for refund for overpayments of FICA taxes and allows adjustments to be made for underpayments, provided the employer used a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the law.

<A NAME="capa"></A><CENTER><H2>Our ERISA Litigation Capabilities
</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Nationally Recognized Expertise</H3>
Faegre & Benson is a leading law firm in the area of ERISA litigation.  Our ERISA litigators have expertise in all areas of ERISA and employee benefits law, and when necessary can consult with other lawyers in the firm who are expert in the areas of tax law, insurance law, securities law, banking and trust law, employ-ment law, and bankruptcy law.  This interdisciplinary approach allows us to provide experienced representation for any type of ERISA case.<P>

The firm has been recognized nationally for its expert-ise in ERISA matters.  A recent survey in International Corporate Law ranked Faegre & Benson in the top ten in the nation in the ERISA & Pension category. 

<H3>Efficient Case Staffing</H3>
Case staffing varies depending on the issues presented, the size of the claim and the client's needs.  Many cases are staffed with a single ERISA litigation attorney.  Larger matters, such as class action lawsuits, may require additional lawyers.  We are committed to providing cost-effective representation and work closely with clients to ensure that files are properly staffed.

<H3>ERISA Litigation Experience</H3>
We have represented clients in a wide variety of ERISA litigation, including:

<UL type=square>
<LI>Breach of fiduciary duty claims.
<LI>Disputes between plans and their service providers.
<LI>Benefit claims under retirement plans, severance pay plans, and life, health and disability plans (self-funded and insured).
<LI>Fiduciary insurance matters.
<LI>Withdrawal liability and delinquent con-tribution claims.
<LI>Claims involving multiple employer arrange-ments, including MEWAs.
<LI>Benefit discrimination and other employment-related claims under Section 510 of ERISA.
<LI>Bankruptcy Court matters involving employers, providers or participants.
<LI>Disputes with the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service.
</UL>

The firm handles all stages of employee benefit/ERISA litigation, from litigation prevention to appeals.  We also assist clients by providing advice on plan admini-strative procedures to avoid or minimize liability.

<H3>ERISA Litigation Database</H3>

We have developed an in-house ERISA litigation database containing the full text of all briefs, memo-randa, and seminar materials written by members of the ERISA litigation team.  The database is full-text searchable so that lawyers doing research and writing briefs do not have to continually reinvent the wheel.  The database also contains summaries of all Supreme Court ERISA cases, and all of the recent ERISA cases from the Eighth Circuit and District of Minnesota.

<H3>The Firm</H3>
Founded in Minneapolis in 1886, Faegre & Benson is one of the 100 largest law firms in the United States.  The firm consists of over 270 lawyers practicing in virtually all areas of law from offices located in/<p>
<center>
<img src="wrld_map.gif">
</center><P>
In ERISA-related matters, Faegre & Benson has regularly represented employers, plans, insurance companies, bank trust departments, trust companies, brokerage firms, actuaries, Taft-Hartley plan trustees, and other types of service providers.

<A NAME="repre"></A><CENTER><h2>Representation of Employers in ERISA Litigation</h2></CENTER>
	
<H3>Type of Claims</H3>

Employers that offer plans providing retirement, health, life, severance or other employee benefits are increasingly being sued in connection with those plans.
<P>

Claims can be brought by participants or their beneficiaries for benefits denied by the plan administrator because of disputes over either the facts or the appropriate interpretation of plan terms.  Sometimes employees or their beneficiaries claim that the plan should have been designed in a way that would have provided the benefit they seek.  Sometimes a claimant alleges that the employer failed to give adequate information or notices, such as failure to provide notices regarding health coverage continuation rights, or failure to provide an adequate summary plan description.  Frequently, these claims are mixed with other types of claims against the employer, such as wrongful discharge or employment discrimination based on age, sex, or disability.
<P>

Claims can also be brought by plan participants or the Department of Labor for improperly carrying out various duties with respect to benefit plans, including:

<UL type=square>
<LI>Breach of fiduciary duty for imprudent investments or imprudent selection of other fiduciaries or service providers (e.g., trustees, investment managers, insurance companies, recordkeepers or claims administrators).
<LI>Failure to operate the plan for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants or their beneficiaries.
<LI>Engaging in ERISA prohibited transactions with plan assets.
<LI>Failure to file annual reports and make other disclosures required by ERISA, or to otherwise follow procedures required by ERISA.
</UL>

An employer may also find it necessary to sue a plan fiduciary or other service provider for wrongful acts or omissions in connection with the employer's plans.

<H3>Specialized Knowledge</H3>

Representing employers in litigation involving employee benefit plans requires specialized knowledge -- knowledge of special ERISA procedures and remedies; knowledge of the interaction of various employment and labor laws with ERISA and tax laws related to employee benefit plans; knowledge of the duties, responsibilities and liabilities imposed by ERISA on employers and other fiduciaries; and knowledge of the design and operation of employee benefit plans.

We are well-versed on ERISA litigation issues, including:

<UL type=square>
<LI>Federal subject matter jurisdiction and removal under the complete preemption doctrine.
<LI>ERISA's special venue, service of process and standing provisions.
<LI>ERISA preemption and the scope of the savings clause for laws regulating insurance, banking and securities.
<LI>The standard of review.
<LI>Failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
<LI>Availability of punitive and other extra-contractual damages.
<LI>Recovery of attorneys' fees.
</UL>

<h2>IRS Rules On "Deregistration" of U.S. Qualified Plan</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Randy Gegelman</h4>

<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>t has become increasingly difficult to structure a pension plan so that it satisfies both the "qualification" requirements of U.S. law and the "registration" requirements of Canadian law.   A recent private letter ruling issued by the IRS (PLR 9537028, June 21, 1995) demonstrates the tax complications that can result when an employer determines that it is no longer possible to do so and allows "deregistration" of a plan in Canada.<P>

PLR 9537028 involved a situation where the Canadian affiliate of a U.S. company contributed to a U.S. qualified profit sharing plan on behalf of its employees in Canada.  The plan was "registered" in Canada prior to 1992, which entitled the Canadian employees to defer tax on contributions made to the plan and on earnings within the plan.  However, as a result of changes made to the tax laws in Canada, it was determined that it would no longer be possible to comply with both the registration requirements in Canada and the qualification requirements in the U.S.  The Canadian affiliate thus established a separate registered plan in Canada and removed its employees from the U.S. qualified plan.<P>

The employer wished to allow the Canadian employees to receive a distribution from the U.S. qualified profit sharing plan while it was still registered in Canada.  This would permit the employees to roll the distribution amount over into a "locked-in" Registered Retirement Savings Plan ("RRSP")  (which is comparable to an IRA in the U.S.) and thus defer tax in Canada until subsequent distributions were made from the RRSP.<P>

The U.S. tax laws imposed a significant obstacle to the proposed course of action.  Section 871(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ("Code") imposes a 30% tax on amounts received by a nonresident alien as wages, interest, dividends, etc. to the extent that the amounts received are "from sources within" the U.S. but are not "effectively connected" with the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S.   This 30% tax can be reduced by treaty.<P>

An employer contribution to a pension or profit sharing plan generally is viewed as compensation to the employee on whose behalf the contribution is made.  If the services giving rise to the compensation are performed outside the U.S. the compensation is not "from sources within" the U.S.  In the situation addressed in the PLR, therefore, the portion of the distribution reflecting employer contributions would not be taxed in the U.S. because the contributions were for services performed outside the U.S.   However, the investment earnings within the trust would have been income from sources within the U.S. and thus would be subject to tax in the U.S. under Code section 871(a) when distributed.  [Note:  The investment earnings were not effectively connected with a trade or business in the U.S.]  [Note also:  The Canada-U.S. Treaty reduces the tax rate to 15% in this circumstance.]<P>

To avoid any tax in the U.S., the employer proposed to structure the distributions to fit within an exception to Code section 871(a).  The exception, found in Code section 871(f), provides that tax is not imposed in the U.S. on "any amount received as an annuity" from a U.S. qualified plan if (i) all the personal services for which the annuity is payable were performed by a nonresident alien outside the U.S., and (ii) at the time the first amount is paid as an annuity, 90% or more of the employees covered by the plan are citizens or residents of the U.S.   Conditions (i) and (ii) could be met, but the distribution still would have to be structured as an "annuity" to fit within Code section 871(f).<P>

In an attempt to fit within the "annuity" definition, the employer proposed that payments be made in five equal quarterly installments with each installment computed at the outset of the distribution period based on a projected rate of return on investments.  The rate would be one percentage point below the rate of return on a GIC Fund in which the amounts to be distributed would actually be invested.  A sixth payment would be made if the actual return on the GIC Fund exceeded the projected rate used to calculate the distributions (which would almost certainly occur).<P>
  
The IRS concluded that the five quarterly installments were annuity payments and thus would be exempt from tax in the U.S. under Code section 871(f).  The IRS further concluded that the sixth payment was not an annuity payment, and thus would be taxable in the U.S. under Code section 871(a) because the Code section 871(f) exception did not apply to it.  The plan administrator was thus required to withhold 15% (the Code section 871(a) rate as modified by the Canada-U.S. Treaty) on the sixth payment.  <P>

The Canadian employees thus were subject to U.S. tax on the payment from the U.S. qualified plan.  The Canadian employees could not recapture this amount by filing a tax return in the U.S.<P>

<TITLE> Crediting Foreign Service and Compensation Under an RPP </title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>
<h2>Crediting Foreign Service and Compensation Under an RPP</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Randy Gegelman</h4>

<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> Canadian employee may be called upon by his/her employer from time to time to render services outside of Canada.  This temporary employment outside of Canada may be directly for the Canadian employer or for an affiliate of the Canadian employer (for example, a parent or subsidiary in the U.S.).  If the employee participates in a registered pension plan ("RPP"), he/she may wish to continue that participation while performing services outside of Canada.

<H5>Credit for employment outside of Canada in not permitted under the general rules.</H5>
 
An RPP can, as a general rule, provide benefits only with respect to services in Canada  this general rule is set out in Section 8503(3)(a) of the Income Tax Regulations.  In addition, Section 147.1 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) allows Revenue Canada to revoke the registration of a plan if the Pension Adjustment ("PA") of any member of the plan exceeds 18% of his/her compensation, with compensation being limited to amounts received from a participating employer while the member is resident in Canada.   <P>

Section 8507 of the Income Tax Regulations, however, allows an RPP to "prescribe" compensation to a member during any period that qualifies as an "eligible period of temporary absence."   The amount that can be prescribed generally is the amount that would have been paid by the participating employer if the member had continued working for that employer on a regular basis. <P>

Although prescribed compensation counts for purposes of calculating a PA, the regulations allowing compensation to be prescribed may not be helpful for foreign service because the period of foreign service may not qualify as an "eligible period of temporary absence," or because the actual compensation received for such service is greater than the compensation that can be prescribed.

<H5>Revenue Canada has created an exception.</H5>

Crediting service and/or full compensation under a defined benefit RPP for employment outside of Canada thus is possible only because Revenue Canada has created limited exceptions to the above general rules.  These exceptions are set out in Pension Reform Update 93-2.

<H5>Credit for eligible service outside of Canada</H5>

Revenue Canada allows unlimited credit to be given under a defined benefit RPP for  service outside of Canada if the service is for a Canadian employer that participates in the RPP and the member is, or has been, resident in Canada.  This covers the situation where a Canadian citizen or resident renders service for a foreign branch of a Canadian company.

Revenue Canada also allows credit to be given under a defined benefit RPP for service outside of Canada if the service is for a foreign affiliate of a Canadian employer (the foreign affiliate generally will not participate in the RPP) and the member is, or has been, resident in Canada and has previously rendered service for a participating employer in Canada.  In this case, however, service credit is limited to the first three years of service outside of Canada (the three-year period can start over again if the employee returns to Canada and renders service for a participating employer in Canada for at least 12 months).  In addition, only current service credit is allowed, not past service credit.

<H5>Credit for compensation earned for service outside of Canada
</H5>
If credit is permitted for service outside of Canada, the compensation received for such service generally can be counted in determining the members PA.  If the compensation is received from a foreign affiliate (which generally will not participate in the RPP), the compensation is attributed to a participating employer in the RPP for purposes of calculating the PA.  [Note: Compensation cannot be counted twice  once under Section 8507 of the Income Tax Regulations allowing compensation to be prescribed during an "eligible period of temporary absence," and again under the special rules in Update 93-2.]<P>

<H4>Money Purchase RPP</H4>

In the case of a money purchase RPP,  Revenue Canada will review requests to count the actual compensation received by a foreign affiliate for purposes of calculating the PA on a case-by-case basis.<P>

The difference can be very significant if Canadian or other foreign workers sometimes perform services in the U.S.  It can also be very significant for particular industries, such as the rail industry.<P>

U.S. employers should consider amending their U.S. qualified plans to make full use of the permissible exclusion.  If the employer wishes to go farther and exclude additional nonresident aliens, the plan must specifically do so.  However, any exclusion beyond the permissible exclusion noted above may be limited by the coverage rules under Code section 410(b).<P>

<TITLE> Employees Profit Sharing Plans (EPSPs) </title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<h2>Employees Profit Sharing Plans (EPSPs)</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Randy Gegelman</h4>

<FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>anada has two types of profit sharing plans  deferred profit sharing plans (DPSP) and employees profit sharing plans (EPSP).

<p>

Both are similar to a profit sharing plan in the U.S.  However, only a DPSP has the same tax advantages to an employee as a qualified profit sharing plan in the U.S.

<P>

A DPSP and EPSP each allow employees (or a designated group of employees) to share in the profits of a business.  Each year amounts are paid to a trust to be held and invested for the members in the plan.  However, contributions to an EPSP are taxable to employees when made to the trust, as are earnings allocated to the employees' accounts under the EPSP.  This is not the case for a DPSP or a qualified profit sharing plan in the U.S.  In these plans, contributions and earnings are tax-deferred.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>An EPSP is not a registered plan
<LI>An EPSP is not a registered plan in Canada (or it is not a qualified plan using tax law parlance in the U.S.).  
<LI>An EPSP trust is tax exempt
</UL>


Even though an EPSP is not a registered plan, its trust is tax exempt under Section 144(2) of the Income Tax Act (Canada).  This is the principal tax advantage of an EPSP.  If a plan does not qualify as an EPSP, its trust would be taxable.

<p>

<H4>Contributions must be computed by reference to profits
</H4>

To qualify as an EPSP, contributions made under the plan must either be computed by reference to profits, or made out of profits.  If contributions are "out of profits," the employer must file an election under Section 144(10) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)to have the plan treated as an EPSP.  An election is not necessary if contributions are "computed by reference to profits."<P>

Contributions are computed by reference to profits if the employer is obligated to make contributions under a formula where profits are the principal variable.  The formula must define the contribution as a percentage of profits and this percentage cannot be less than 1%.<P>

A plan will qualify as an EPSP if it provides for contributions out of profits and the employer files an election under section 144(10) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) to treat the plan as an EPSP.  Contributions must still be made under a formula set forth in the plan.  The formula can be:

<UL>
<LI>A percentage of pay per person.
<LI>A fixed dollar amount per person.
<LI>A matching contribution made on employee contributions.
</UL>


The formula can define a minimum employer contribution with additional contributions made at the discretion of the employer.  However, the employer contribution under the formula must be more than nominal  they generally must be at least 1% of pay or $100.

<H4>Earnings of all participating affiliates can be counted</H4>

In determining whether profits exist in order to make a contribution to an EPSP, the earnings and profits of all participating affiliates can be aggregated.  If an affiliate does not participate in an EPSP  that is, if its employees are not covered  the profits of that affiliate must be ignored.

<H4>Employee contributions allowed (but not deductible)</H4>

An EPSP may allow employee contributions, but such contributions are not deductible under the Income Tax Act (Canada) as would employee contributions to a Group RRSP.

<H4>Vesting schedules</H4>

An EPSP may impose a vesting requirement on benefits  for example, the plan could require continued employment for five years to receive a benefit.  However, contributions made on behalf of an employee (and allocated earnings) are taxable to the employee whether or not such amounts are vested when allocated.  If an employee later forfeits an amount, he/she may be allowed a deduction under Section 144(9) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) for the forfeited amount previously included in income.  Even so, a forfeiture provision is not an attractive provision for employees.

<H4>Investments in employer stock</H4>

An EPSP can be invested in stock of the sponsoring employer.  If an EPSP invests in employer stock, the stock must be purchased on the  open market and not contributed to the trust.  This is because the employer will be denied a deduction for contributions made to an EPSP in the form of its stock, and also will be denied a deduction for all cash contributions that are used to purchase treasury shares from the employer.

<H4>Section 144(10) Election</H4>

For a plan that makes contributions out of profits to be an EPSP, an election must be made under Section 144(10) of the Income Tax Act (Canada).  The election must be made by each affiliate that participates in the plan.  If an affiliate is added but it does not file the Section 144(10) election, the plan may be disqualified as an EPSP retroactive to the date the affiliate is added.

<H4>Reporting</H4>

The trustee of an EPSP (or the sponsoring employer) is required to report to participants the amounts allocated to their accounts during the year.  This is reported on Form T4PS Summary and Supplementary, which is also filed with Revenue Canada.<P>

<H2>Planning for Lifetime Distributions from Qualified Plans and IRAs</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Randy Gegelman</h4>


<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he principal retirement vehicle and an important estate planning vehicle for the owners of a family business may be the qualified pension or profit sharing plan maintained by that business.  A family business owner  may wish to keep money in that qualified plan as long as possible to take full advantage of the tax-deferral provided by the plan or to accumulate as much as possible for his/her heirs upon death.  The same may be true for assets held in an individual retirement account (IRA), whether those assets have accumulated through annual contributions or by means of a rollover from a qualified plan.   However, the ability to keep money in a qualified plan or IRA is limited by minimum distribution and incidental death benefit rules imposed under the tax laws. 

<p>

The minimum distribution and incidental death benefit rules are very technical.  However, to take full advantage of the tax deferral and estate planning opportunities offered by a qualified plan or IRA (and to avoid pitfalls), at least a general understanding of these rules is essential for any person who has substantial assets accumulated in such arrangements.   To take full advantage of the rules,  you must make certain elections in a timely manner.

<p>

Because most family businesses maintain defined contribution - profit sharing, 401(k) - plans, this article is limited to a discussion of such plans, and also to IRAs.

<p>

<H4>Minimum Distribution Rule</H4>

The minimum distribution rule generally requires that a participant in a qualified plan or IRA receive at least a minimum distribution from the plan or IRA each year beginning with the year in which he/she reaches age 70-1/2.  This minimum amount must be paid from the plan or IRA by December 31 of that year.  [Note:  A special rule allows the minimum distribution amount due for the year in which the participant reaches age 70-1/2 (and that year only) to be delayed to as late as April 1 of the next year - this April 1 date is called the required beginning date.]

<p>

If a minimum distribution amount is not timely paid from a qualified plan or IRA, the participant (the payee) is subject to a 50% penalty tax on the amount that should have been distributed but was not.  [Note:  In the case of an employer  plan, the qualified status of the plan is also in jeopardy.]

<p>

The minimum distribution amount each year is generally calculated under the following formula:

<blockquote>
Account Balance at
  the End of the Prior Year  
<STRONG>/</STRONG>Applicable Life Expectancy
</blockquote>

The applicable life expectancy used in the denominator of the fraction depends upon the elections made by the individual under the qualified plan or IRA.  [Note:  It is possible, though not common, for a qualified plan to limit the elections available to a participant in order to ease administration.]

<p>

A participant is allowed the following elections:

<UL>
<LI><LI>The participant can elect to have minimum distributions paid over his/her single life expectancy or paid over the joint life expectancy of him/her and a designated beneficiary.
<LI>The participant can elect to have his/her life expectancy recalculated each year, or not recalculated.
<LI>The participant can elect to have the life expectancy of his/her spouse beneficiary recalculated each year, or not recalculated.  [Note: The life expectancy of a nonspouse beneficiary cannot be recalculated.]
</UL>


If a life expectancy is not recalculated, it is simply reduced by one each year.  The applicable life expectancy for a given year is the starting life expectancy when the participant reached age 70-1/2 minus the number of years that have elapsed since age 70-1/2.

<P>

If a life expectancy is recalculated, the applicable life expectancy is redetermined each year from life expectancy tables.  Although the life expectancy of a given person is shorter than it was a year before, it is not shorter by a full year (it may be shorter by 6 or 9 months, for example).

<P>

The consequence of recalculating life expectancy is that it may substantially extend the payout period and thus allow longer tax deferral.

<P>

There is a cost to having life expectancy recalculated.  If the life expectancy of a person is being recalculated, when that person dies, his/her life expectancy drops to zero in the next year.  This does not happen if life expectancy is simply being reduced by one, and a drop to zero  greatly accelerates the payout period.

<P>

Charts A and B (below) illustrate the payout stream that would be required from a qualified plan or IRA if life expectancies are and are not recalculated.  In Chart A both the participant and spouse survive the full payout period (an unlikely event).  In Chart B both the participant and spouse die in the 14th year of the payout period.  The full account balance must be paid out the next year if life expectancies are being recalculated (but not if they are not being recalculated).

<P>

<H3>Both Survive Full Payout Period</H3></center>
<img src="chart_a.gif">
<p>
<center><H2>Chart B</H2>
<H3>Both Die in 14th Year of Payout Period</H3></center>
<img src="chart_b.gif">


<H4>Incidental Death Benefit Rule
</H4>

The incidental death benefit rule operates the same way as the minimum distribution rule.  However, the incidental death benefit rule generally restricts payouts only if the designated beneficiary is someone other than the spouse of the participant, and then only if the designated beneficiary is 10 or more years younger than the participant. 

<P>

The minimum distribution amount each year under the incidental death benefit rule is generally calculated under the following formula:

<blockquote>
Account Balance at
the End of the Prior Year<STRONG>/</STRONG>
Applicable Divisor
</blockquote>

The applicable divisor used in the denominator of the fraction is determined under IRS tables.  It generally is the same as the joint life expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary who is 10 years younger than the participant.

<p>

The consequence of the incidental death benefit rule is that, if a beneficiary is designated who is more than 10 years younger than the participant, it shortens the minimum distribution period.  Chart C (below) illustrates the payout stream that would be required from a qualified plan or IRA under the minimum distribution rule alone, and under the incidental death benefit rule alone, assuming that a participant designates his/her child as beneficiary and the beneficiary is 25 years younger than the participant.  The payout required in any year is the greater of the two amounts for that year.

<p>

</center>
<img src="chart_c.gif">

<H4>Other Considerations</H4>

Merely taking the minimum amount necessary to satisfy the minimum distribution and incidental death benefit rules may create other tax problems for an individual.  For example, subject to exceptions, the federal tax laws impose a 15% penalty tax on distributions from all qualified plans and IRAs in any year in excess of $150,000 (indexed for inflation).  Taking only the minimum distribution amount in early years may cause the minimum distribution in later years to exceed $150,000 (as indexed for inflation to that year) and thus be subject to the penalty tax.  Further, a 15% penalty tax is imposed on a deceased individual's excess retirement accumulation.  Very generally, an excess retirement accumulation is the excess of the value at death of the participant's interest in all qualified plans and IRAs over the value of a single life annuity with annual payments equal to the $150,000 threshold noted above (as indexed).  Taking only the minimum distribution amount may result in an excess retirement accumulation at death.

<p>

<H4>Conclusion</H4>

For the owner of a family business who has substantial assets accumulated for retirement in a qualified plan or IRA, proper tax and estate planning for such accumulations is essential.  The effect of the minimum distribution rule, incidental death benefit rule and penalty tax provisions of the tax laws is vital.   Early consideration of these issues may avoid later complications.

<TITLE> Planning for the Distribution of Retirement Savings at Death </title>

<h2>Planning for the Distribution of Retirement Savings at Death</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>David J. Shannon</h4>

<FONT SIZE=+2>F</FONT>or more and more family business owners and employees, a significant portion of their wealth is accumulated in qualified retirement plans<SUPER>1</SUPER> (qualified plans) and individual retirement accounts (IRAs).  These vehicles of savings are very popular for two reasons.  First, amounts contributed to qualified plans and IRAs, subject to certain limitations, are either excludible or deductible from gross income.  Second, income earned within qualified plans and IRAs is not recognized for tax purposes until distributed.  The entire amount of such income can, therefore, accumulate within the plan or IRA and grow tax-free.<P>

Because qualified plans and IRAs are subject to a very complex set of rules and regulations, however, planning for the distribution of these assets at a participant's death is not an easy task.  Many factors must be considered carefully during the estate planning process to insure that distribution of these assets is consistent with the participant's overall estate planning objectives and accomplished in a manner which will minimize taxes.  This article will provide a brief overview of some of the issues that often arise during this planning process.

<H4>A. Tax Considerations</H4>

Although qualified plans and IRAs receive very favorable tax treatment during the lifetime of the participant, at the participant's death the exact opposite occurs.  Assets held in qualified plans and IRAs at death may be subject to several different taxes.  These taxes include the following:<P>

<blockquote><STRONG>1. Income taxes:</STRONG> Generally speaking, distributions from qualified plans and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income to the recipient.  Under current law, the federal income tax rate starts at 15% and increases to a maximum rate of 39.6%.  State income taxes may also apply.<P>

<STRONG>2. Estate taxes:</STRONG>   Under current law, federal estate taxes are imposed when a decedent's taxable estate exceeds $600,000.  At that level, the federal estate tax rate starts at 37% and increases to a maximum rate of 55% for taxable estates in excess of $3,000,000. With some minor exceptions, the full value of a decedent's qualified plans and IRAs is includible in his/her gross estate.  State death taxes may also apply.<P>

<STRONG>3. Excise tax on excess accumulation:</STRONG>  If a decedent dies with too much wealth accumulated in his/her qualified plans and IRAs, federal law imposes a 15% excise tax on the excess accumulation.  A decedent has an excess accumulation if the aggregate amount in his/her qualified plans and IRAs exceeds the present value of a certain hypothetical life annuity.<P>

<STRONG>4. Generation-skipping taxes:</STRONG>  Transfers from qualified plans and IRAs at death to a person more than one generation below the decedent may be subject to the federal generation-skipping tax.  The federal generation-skipping tax is a flat tax with a current rate of 55%.  </blockquote><P>

For some decedents, the combination of these various taxes can result in more than 50% of the aggregate amount of their qualified plans and IRAs passing to federal and state taxing authorities, rather than to their designated beneficiaries.  Proper planning, however, can often eliminate, or significantly reduce, many of these taxes.  Some of the tools and techniques relied upon by estate planners to achieve this objective are the following:<P>

<blockquote><STRONG>1. Spousal rollover IRA:</STRONG>  If a decedent's surviving spouse is the beneficiary designated to receive a lump sum distribution from a qualified plan or IRA at the decedent's death, the surviving spouse, within a certain period of time,  may roll all or any portion of this amount into an IRA registered in his/her name.  The income tax on any amount so rolled will be deferred until the surviving spouse subsequently withdraws such amount from the IRA.  Moreover, income earned on the assets rolled to the IRA can continue to accumulate tax free until the surviving spouse or his/her designated beneficiary is required to withdraw the same.<P>

<STRONG>2. Use of life expectancies: </STRONG> As discussed in more detail elsewhere in this newsletter, by April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant attains the age of 70-1/2 (the required beginning date), the participant must begin satisfying the minimum distribution rule .  The minimum distribution rule can be satisfied in many different ways.  Payments may be made over the life expectancy of the participant, the life expectancies of the participant and the participant's spouse (with none, one or both life expectancies being recalculated) or the life expectancies of the participant and a designated beneficiary.  If the participant dies after distributions have commenced to satisfy the minimum distribution rule, the decisions made by the participant to satisfy the minimum distribution rule will have a direct impact on how quickly the assets remaining in the participant's qualified plan or IRA must be withdrawn after the participant's death.  This, in turn, will have a direct impact on when income taxes must be paid on the assets remaining in the qualified plan or IRA.  The alternatives available to the participant to satisfy the minimum distribution rule should, therefore, be considered well in advance of the part-icipant's required beginning date.<P>

<STRONG>3. Marital deduction planning:</STRONG>  If a decedent designates his/her spouse who is a citizen of the United States or the trustee of certain qualifying trusts as the beneficiary to receive his/her qualified plan or IRA at death, the amount passing to the spouse outright or to the trustee of the qualifying trust will qualify for the estate tax marital deduction.  This deduction is an unlimited deduction which allows estate taxes to be deferred until the death of the surviving spouse or, in some cases, eliminated entirely.  If the trustee of a qualifying trust is selected as the designated beneficiary, extreme care must be taken in drafting the trust instrument to make certain that all requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code are satisfied.<P>

<STRONG>4. Charitable planning:</STRONG>  If a decedent designates a qualified charitable organization or the trustee of a charitable remainder trust as the beneficiary to receive some or all of his/her qualified plan or IRA at death, the amount passing to the charity outright or a portion of the amount passing to the trustee of the charitable remainder trust at death will qualify for the estate tax charitable deduction.  This deduction is an unlimited deduction which allows estate taxes to be eliminated entirely.  Moreover, since qualified charitable organizations and charitable remainder trusts are generally not subject to income tax, the income tax that would ordinarily be due and payable with respect to the distribution of the funds from the qualified plan or IRA can also be eliminated entirely.  If the trustee of a charitable remainder trust is selected as the designated beneficiary, extreme care must be taken in drafting the trust instrument to make certain that all requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code are satisfied.<P>

<STRONG>5. GST exemption: </STRONG> The Internal Revenue Code grants each individual a $1,000,000 generation-skipping transfer tax exemption.  Proper allocation of this exemption can allow a decedent to transfer up to $1,000,000 from his/her qualified plans and IRAs to persons more than one generation below him/her without incurring any federal generation-skipping tax.<P>

<STRONG>6. Actuarial projections:</STRONG>  For individuals who currently have a significant amount of wealth accumulated in their qualified plans and IRAs, it may be appropriate to run actuarial projections under various assumptions to examine the impact of the various taxes discussed above on such plans and IRAs and to consider what action, if any, may be taken immediately to reduce or eliminate such taxes.  For example, an individual who may be exposed to the 15% excise tax on an excess accumulation may want to consider reducing the amount he/she is contributing to his/her qualified plans and IRAs or withdrawing an amount in excess of that required by the minimum distribution rule.  Several computer software programs are available to run these types of projections.</blockquote>

<H4>B. Spousal Consent Rules</H4>

The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA) prohibits a participant from designating someone other than his/her spouse as beneficiary of his/her qualified plans without such spouse's prior written consent.  The spousal consent rules of REA do not apply to IRAs.<P>

If for any reason a participant should determine that it is appropriate to designate someone other then his/her spouse as beneficiary of his/her qualified plans, it is, therefore, imperative that the prior written consent of the spouse be obtained.  Failure to obtain this consent will cause any other beneficiary designation filed with the plan administrator to be wholly ineffective.<P>

Under current law, it does not appear that a spousal consent incorporated in an antenuptial agreement satisfies the requirements imposed by REA.  If the intent of the parties is to provide for distribution of some or all of the participant's qualified plans to someone other than the spouse, it is, therefore, imperative that a proper spousal consent be executed and filed with the plan administrator after the solemnization of the marriage.

<H4>C. Family
     Considerations</H4>

The unique facts surrounding each parti-cipant's family situation can often play a critical role in determining how best to plan for the disposition of the participant's qualified plans and IRAs at death.  For example, if the participant's spouse is in poor health, it may not be appropriate to elect to recalculate the life expectancies of the participant and the participant's spouse for purposes of satisfying the minimum distribution rule.  To do so may simply accelerate the distribution of assets from the participant's qualified plans and IRAs at the participant's death, and consequently, accelerate the income tax obligation associated with these assets.<P>

Similarly, although a participant will often name his/her spouse as the primary beneficiary of his/her qualified plans and IRAs, if the participant has minor children, it may not be appropriate to name the children as the contingent beneficiaries.  Rather, the participant may want to structure his/her estate plan to provide that if the participant's spouse does not survive him/her, the assets held in his/her qualified plans and IRAs will be paid to a trustee to be administered and distributed for the benefit of the participant's minor children until they attain a certain age.  Otherwise, it may be necessary to commence a separate court proceeding to have a guardian or conservator appointed for each minor child to receive and administer such assets on his/her behalf.  This can be both costly and cumbersome for the family.

<H4>D. Conclusion</H4>

Many factors must be taken into account to properly plan for the disposition of the assets held in a decedent's qualified plans and IRAs at death.  Absent such planning, a significant portion of the participant's qualified plans and IRAs may end up in the hands of the taxing authorities, rather than in the hands of the participant's intended beneficiaries.  By properly planning for the disposition of these assets at death, however, the participant should be able to achieve his/her overall estate planning objectives at the minimum tax cost.<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>1	Qualified retirement plans may be one of two types:  defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans.  A defined benefit plan is a plan that provides a specific benefit based on a number of factors, such as years of service and level of compensation.  A typical example would be a company pension plan.<P>

A defined contribution plan is a plan that allows contributions to be made to it by the participant and/or his/her employer, which contributions are then held in a separate account for the benefit of the participant.  Typical examples would include a profit-sharing plan, a 401(k) plan, a stock bonus plan or an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).</FONT><P>

<H2>Bank Mergers and Acquisitions</H2>

<blockquote>
Faegre & Benson represents clients in all phases of bank acquisitions.  We have represented buyers, sellers, investment bankers and lenders in connection with various public and private acquisition transactions.  These transactions have employed a myriad of acquisition structures and forms of consideration, including sales or purchases of stock, purchase and assumptions, mergers, exchange offers and cash tender offers.  Faegre & Benson has experience in interstate and intrastate purchases and sales of banks and thrifts (both healthy and failed) and branches.
<P>

We possess a breadth of experience in corporate and banking law, securities regulation, finance and other corporate and banking disciplines important to the successful completion of bank change-in-control transactions.  Such transactions call for specialized bank regulatory expertise, including processing applications with the OCC, FRB, FDIC, OTS, Minnesota Department of Commerce and other regulatory agencies; antitrust analysis; knowledge of the limitations on banking holding company activities; examination of intrastate and interstate banking and branching limitations; experience with issues related to failed bank and thrift transactions; and familiarity with Community Reinvestment Act compliance and capital adequacy guidelines.
<P>

Of special interest in Minnesota transactions is Faegre & Benson's active and on-going participation in the drafting, review and amendment of the business combination, control share and other relevant provisions of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act and the corporate takeover provisions of the Minnesota Securities Act.  
<P>

Our acquisition lawyers work closely with lawyers specializing in other areas of the law who provide critical support for today's complex transactions.  These areas of practice include tax, employee benefits, labor, anti-trust, real estate, environmental, government relations and litigation.  Members of our  Minneapolis-based government relations group provide up-to-date information on the latest federal and state regulatory developments.

During October 1996 this office commenced civil actions on behalf of the owners of over 1,500 low- and moderate-income rental housing units located throughout the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Alabama, and Alaska.  These units constitute housing projects financed through mortgage loans federally insured or issued by HUD and FmHA.  The civil actions, filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., seek on behalf of those HUD and FmHA project owners named in the actions the recovery of lost profits for (i) breaches of contract; and (ii) unconstitutional takings of property without just compensation, resulting from the enactment by Congress of:

<LI>The Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA or the 1990 legislation) affecting HUD Section 221(d)(3) and Section 236 project owners; and
<p>

<LI>Title VII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Title VII or the 1992 legislation) affecting FmHA Section 515 and 521 project owners.
</OL>


<STRONG><EM>Lost Right To Go To Market.</EM></STRONG>  The 1990 and 1992 legislation purports to prohibit HUD and FmHA project owners from exercising their contractual right to terminate, without Government restriction, their participation in Government housing programs upon prepayment of their mortgage loans.  As a result of the Governments actions, many owners will be unable to terminate their participation in Government housing programs at any time before the forty (40) or fifty (50) year terms of their loans actually expire.  Thus, those owners who desire to exercise their contractual right to go to market either (i) by raising their rents to commercial market rates; or (ii) by selling their properties in the commercial market, are unable to do so.
<p>

<STRONG><EM>Lost Profits.</EM></STRONG>  The Governments actions have deprived owners of certain revenues including but not limited to the following:
<OL type=1>
<LI>increased rents;
<p>

<LI>the equity in the projects;
<p>

<LI>potential buyers in the unsubsidized commercial housing market;
<p>

<LI>access to reserve, residual receipts, and reserve for replacement accounts.
</OL>


Other lost opportunity costs have been incurred as a result of the Government's conscription of project owners to provide subsidized housing without compensation.		
<p>

Many housing project owners have lost thousands of dollars per unit in profits over the course of their damage periods.  The expectation of such profits constituted one of the primary incentives for owners to enter into the Government housing programs in the first place.  The pending litigation is designed to recover the profits to which owners are contractually entitled but which they have lost as a consequence of the Governments actions.
<p>

<STRONG>Cienega Gardens <em>and</em> Winstar.</STRONG>  In a related case, <EM>Cienega Gardens v. United States</EM>, the United States Court of Federal Claims rejected certain Government defenses and decided as a matter of law that the Governments restriction of the contractual right to prepay housing project mortgage loans constitutes a breach of contract.  Moreover, on July 1, 1996, in <EM>Winstar Corp. v. United States</EM>, the United States Supreme Court held that similar Government attempts to change the "rules of the game" constituted breaches of contracts with savings and loan institutions.  Both the <EM>Cienega</EM> and <EM>Winstar</EM> cases will control a number of the issues to be raised by the Government in the pending litigation.
<p>

<STRONG><EM>Statute of Limitations.</EM></STRONG>  Project owners should be aware that, depending upon individual circumstances, their claims may be time barred by the statute of limitations.  Unless an action is timely filed on behalf of a specific owner, that owners damages claim may be subject to dismissal.  Since the pending litigation is not a class action, the statute of limitations continues to run against those owners who have not joined in the litigation.  In addition, no damages can be recovered on behalf of any owner unless and until it joins a civil action as a party plaintiff.    
<p>

<STRONG><EM>All Project Owners Are Eligible.</EM></STRONG>  Those project owners that are currently parties to the pending civil actions, as well as those who wish to become parties to additional civil actions to be filed in the near future, include owners (i) who would have prepaid but for the government's breach; (ii) who intend to prepay at some point before the end of their loan terms but have been compelled to apply for incentives under the 1990 or 1992 legislation in order to avoid forced sales of their properties; (iii) who have never applied for incentives; (iv) who have actually received certain incentives; and (v) who have been compelled to transfer their properties in lieu of applying for incentives.
<p>

<STRONG><EM>Reminder:</EM></STRONG>  The pending civil actions protect and cover only those project owners who have become a party plaintiff by joining the litigation.

<H2>Landmark Procurement Legislation:
The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act 
(FASA) of 1994</H2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_mpls.html#eckland">Jeff Eckland</a></h4><br>

On October 13, 1994, as a large crowd of legislators, agency-heads, general counsels and federal procurement reform well-wishers enthusiastically looked on during a Rose Garden ceremony, President Clinton signed into law the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-355) (FASA). This landmark legislation is designed to transform the $200 billion a year federal procurement process into a simplified, more efficient and accessible system. FASA will significantly change how the government conducts its business. <br>


However, FASA establishes only a framework for simplifying or streamlining the current federal acquisition process.  Most of FASA's sweeping changes will not impact the contracting process until the act is implemented by extensive regulatory changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Only a limited number of changes are effective immediately.  The balance take effect within the earlier of 30 days after publication of final regulations or October 1, 1995.  Despite an ongoing expedited regulatory drafting process, the Act also mandates a 60-day period for public comment.  Industry therefore is well advised to monitor closely proposed revisions to the FAR.
<br>


Notable FASA improvements designed to streamline and simplify the federal acquisition process include:
<br>

<ul><li>Eliminating most paperwork and record keeping requirements for high volume acquisitions below $100,000 (Simplified Acquisition Threshold) (SAT));<br>

<li>Allowing direct micropurchases of items below $2,500 without competitive quotations or compliance with Buy American Act and certain small business requirements;<br>

<li>Exempting commercial product procurements from certain existing as well as future enacted laws, including exemptions from the submission of cost or pricing data and the cost accounting standards (CAS) requirements; establishing an agency preference for commercial items; and other continuing initiatives promoting the acquisition of commercial items to minimize time delays, research and development, and detailed design specifications and testing, thereby making government procurement easier and less costly;<br>

<li>Establishing a Government-wide  Federal Acquisition Computer Network (FACNET) to convert a current acquisition process overburdened by paperwork to an expedited electronic data interchange system (EDI) readily accessible to the public. FACNET will inform the public about federal contracting opportunities and permit the electronic submission of bids and proposals. (The EDI initiatives recently announced by the DoD and GSA will likely serve as models for implementing FACNET);<br>

<li>Establishing a six year limitation period for filing claims under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) and increasing dollar thresholds for claim certification and the accelerated and small claims procedures; <br>

<li>Reserving all acquisitions over $2,500 but under $100,000 exclusively for small business concerns, unless the contracting agency is unable to obtain offers from at least two qualified small business firms;<br>

<li>Expanding the Small Disadvantaged Business set - aside program to civilian agency procurements;<br>

<li>Establishing a new 5 percent contracting goal for women-owned small businesses;<br>

<li>Creating a Small Business Procurement Advisory Council composed of representatives from federal agencies which will give high level attention and focus to small businesses;<br>

<li>Preserving private contractors ability to file bid protests in the U.S. District Courts, and authorizing federal district courts to obtain advisory opinions from the boards of contract appeals;<br>

<li>Improving bid protest and contract administration procedures -- particularly by providing more timely and informative debriefings to unsuccessful offerors, establishing government-wide payment protection for first-tier subcontractors and suppliers, and by extending the authority to use alternative dispute resolution procedures under the CDA until October 1, 1999.<br>

<li>Repealing that part of the Walsh-Healey Act requiring an offeror to certify that it is a regular dealer or manufacturer;<br>

<li>Requiring evaluation of past performance before contract award;<br>

<li>Raising the Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) threshold for requiring  certified cost or pricing data to a uniform $500,000 for both civilian agencies and DoD procurements.<br>
</ul>
<font="+2"><b>FASA Highlights:</b></font>
<br>

Contract Disputes Act (CDA) Improvements.  FASA establishes a statute of limitations period of six years for filing claims.  The six year limitation period is measured from the date of accrual of the claim.  The Act also raises to $100,000 from $50,000 the dollar threshold for claim certification.  Finally, the Act increases the dollar threshold levels for expedited claim proceedings before the boards of contract appeals as follows:<br>


Accelerated Claim Procedure:  Now applies to all claims of $100,000 or less (rather than merely $50,000);<br>


Small Claims Procedure:  Now applies to all claims of $50,000 or less (rather than merely $10,000).<br>



These changes make expedited claim procedings much more accessible.  Now claims $50,000 or less can be decided within 120 days and claims $100,000 or less can be decided within 180 days.  The short time frames and larger dollar amounts make Government contract litigation much more efficient and cost effective for all Government contractors.<br>
 

<b>Travel Costs.</b>  FASA repealed that portion of the OFPP Act requiring that costs incurred by contractor personnel for travel be considered reasonable and allowable only to the extent that the costs did not exceed the maximum per diem rates specified in the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) (prescribed by the GSA for travel in the coterminous 48 United States) or the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) (prescribed by the DoD for travel in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United States).  Industry anticipated that this repeal would be implemented through removal of the FTR/JTR restrictions from FAR 31.205-46 and a return to the reasonableness criteria existing prior to the OFPP Act's passage in 1986.<br>


However, the FAR Council has issued a proposed rule retaining the FTR/JTR restrictions as a baseline for determining the reasonableness of travel costs incurred by Government contractors.  The rule only permits contractors to propose alternative rates subject to certain limitations. (59 Fed. Reg. 64542).  Alternative rates would be allowable only if approved before travel costs are incurred.  <br>


No public meeting on this proposed rule has been scheduled.  Interested parties may request a public meeting before January 13, 1995 and/or submit written comments on the proposed rule by February 13, 1995.<br>


Debriefings.  FASA now requires agencies to provide written notice of contract award to unsuccessful offerors and bidders within 3 days of contract award.  Upon receipt of this notice, private contractors have 3 days to file a written request with the agency for an award debriefing.  Agencies must provide, to the maximum extent practicable, any requested debriefing within 5 days of receiving a contractors written debriefing request.  As part of each debriefing, FASA requires agencies to provide the following details:<br>


Significant weaknesses or deficiencies of the unsuccessful offeror;<br>
<ul>
<li>The overall evaluated cost and technical ratings of both the awardee and the unsuccessful offeror;<br>

<li>The overall ranking of offerors;<br>

<li>A summary of the rationale for award;<br>

<li>If the procurement is for a commercial item, the make and model number of the commercial item being provided by the awardee;<br>

<li>Reasonable responses to relevant questions regarding compliance by the agency with applicable procurement rules and regulations.<br>
</ul>


To protect competitive advantages and proprietary data, FASA prohibits agencies from providing a point-by-point comparison of a debriefed offeror with other offerors. FASA also precludes the agencys release of information relating to trade secrets, manufacturing processes, and privileged financial information -- such as cost breakdowns, profit, and indirect cost rates.<br>


BID Protests.  FASA has changed several bid protest procedures at the General Accounting Office (GAO):<br>

<ul><li>Counting Days - Under FASA, the GAOs traditional working day time frame has been replaced with calendar days.  However, if a required action is to occur on a Saturday, Sunday, federal holiday, or an emergency closing, the date for taking the required action automatically extends to the following working day.<br>
</ul>

FASA therefore solves a problem that has occurred at the GAO regarding the calculation of the time period for automatic suspensions of contract performance pending resolution of GAO bid protests.<br>


Pursuant to the Competition in Contracting Act's (CICA) automatic stay provisions, an agency is required to stay performance if the protest is filed within 10 calendar days of contract award.  The GAO determined that if the 10th day fell on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, the time period could not be extended.  Thus, in many cases the GAO's interpretation significantly shortened the time period during which a protester would have to file a protest to qualify for the automatic stay.  The GAO's interpretation directly conflicted with the GSBCA's interpretation of similar suspension provisions in the Brooks Act.  The GSBCA extends the 10 day period to the next working day when the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday.  Thus, FASA makes uniform the calculation of time between the GAO and the GSBCA.<br>


<ul><li>Automatic Stay - FASA now  requires agencies to issue an automatic stay on contract performance when a protester files at the GAO within 10 calendar days after contract award, or within 5 days of an offered debriefing, whichever is later.<br>
</ul>


Theoretically, where the maximum amount of time is used by the Government and a protesting party at each step of the notification and debriefing process, a stay-generating protest could be filed up to 21 calendar days after award.<br>

<ul><li>Fees - For the first time, the Act explicitly provides authority to pay successful protesters expert witness and consultant fees at the highest rate paid by the Government.  In addition, FASA authorizes the recovery of attorneys' fees for other than small businesses at a maximum rate of $150 per hour unless the GAO determines that a higher rate is appropriate. This limitation does not apply to small businesses.  <br>

<li>Protective Orders - Congress granted the GAO in FASA specific statutory authority to issue protective orders in protests.  FASA additionally provides thathen requested, the GAO must provide full case disclosure to Congress.<br>
</ul>


Implementation of the Act.  Implementation of the provisions of the Streamlining Act began immediately after both Houses of Congress voted on the bill.  President Clinton issued Executive Order 12931 requiring agencies to align their procedures with the values stated in the Act.  A project manager within the Acquisition Reform Office of the Under-Secretary of Defense has been named. Inter-Agency teams are drafting implementing regulations covering each of the major areas of FASA, including:<br>

<OL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Contract Award<P>
<LI>Special Contracting Methods<P>
<LI>Truth in Negotiations Act<P>
<LI>Protests and Disputes<P>
<LI>Audits<P>
<LI>Cost Principles<P>
<LI>Contract Financing and Payment<P>
<LI>Simplified Procedures and FACNET<P>
<LI>Small Business<P>
<LI>Ethics<P>
<LI>Commercial Contracting<P>
</OL>



Each team includes an administration representative who has been involved in drafting the administration's position on FASA.  Time limits even more strict than those required by FASA are being imposed on the teams.  Public hearings likely will be held on TINA, commercial contracting, and SAT.  Under one proposed schedule, the FAR Council has established a target date of March 23, 1995 for publication of the final rules to be effective April 22, 1995.  This goal is well within that set by the President -- to beat the statutory deadline (of final publication no later than 330 days after enactment) by 100 days.<br>


In addition to this governmental activity, the Council on Defense Security Industrial Associations (CODSIA) has put together industry groups which will be working in tandem with the Government.  These groups will work with the government inter-agency teams as they develop implementing guidance.<p>

<font="+2"><b>FAR Rewrite</b></font><br>


In late August, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) held a public meeting to discuss with members of the Bar and the business community the effort to rewrite the FAR.  The FAR rewrite is being accomplished in accordance with the Administrations National Performance Review (NPR) recommendation to change acquisition policy by converting the FAR from a set of rigid rules to guiding principles.<br>


Members of the Bar warned against changes that would jeopardize the uniformity of the FAR and result in increased litigation over established precedent in Government contract law.  The Bar stated that the current FAR rewrite effort is too narrowly focused and that the entire procurement process should be reworked.  Some noted that it may be a mistake to rewrite the FAR because a body of interpretative laws and regulations have grown around it which should not summarily be dismissed.  Another major issue discussed is the extent to which agency supplements constitute the real problem with the FAR.  Supplements result in a proliferation of rules and a lessening of government-wide standards.<br>


The NPR goal of rewriting the FAR resulted from a perception that the procurement process does not take concerns of  program customers to heart and allow them to make good procurement judgments.  Dr. Steven Kelman, the Director of the OFPP, has established an eleven member board of directors of senior government officials to examine the FAR.  The re-write of the FAR will be delayed pending implementation of the FASA. <P>

<font="+2"><b>Past Performance</font></b><br>


Past performance has become a buzz word in the government procurement community during the last several months as Dr. Kelman pushes agencies to give more consideration to the past performance of a government contractor in determining the award of new government contracts.  Indeed, past performance has been used in the past by various agencies with success, and Kelman has secured agreement of over 30 agencies to increase the use of past performance.<br>


The use of past performance, however, has been criticized by industry as constituting a vague and ephemeral criterion for determining the award of contracts.  Industry proposed that FASA: (i) include an administrative process to challenge derogatory past performance information; (ii) establish mandatory, uniform criteria; and (iii) purge information after a fixed time period.  Despite such recommendations Congress did not provide agencies in FASA itself with specific guidance for considering past performance.  Instead, FASA simply provides that (i) past contract performance is one relevant factor that should be considered; and (ii) consideration of past performance constitutes an appropriate indicator of future performance.  In addition, Congress directed the OFPP to provide specified guidance to agencies on evaluating and managing past performance evaluations.<P>

<font="+2"><b>Merger Mania</b></font><br>
 

The downsizing of the defense industry has produced further mergers, most notably the $23 billion union of Lockheed and Martin-Marietta to form Lockheed Martin.  That announcement followed by several weeks the Defense Science Boards recommendation on mergers in the defense industry caused by the downsizing of the defense community.  As a result of that report, the Defense Department has organized a better system for reviewing proposed mergers and passing on departmental views to the enforcing agencies, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission.  Hopefully a system such as this will avert problems which occurred last year in certain merger efforts thwarted in litigation in Federal Court in the District of Columbia. These results turned largely on the fact that the Defense Department not only did not present its views with force and effect, but probably had no consistent views to present.<P>

<font="+2"><b>International Procurement</b></font><br>


In 1994 the U.S. and the European Union reached agreement on government procurement and incorporated it into the GATT Government Procurement Agreement.  GATT was ratified by the Congress in the special session after the election.  The GATT provisions cover central government procurement, i.e., by the Federal government, and subcentral government procurement by the states. This has not resulted in total uniformity but most states have agreed to provide coverage for a large number of their Executive Branch agencies.  The problem was more complicated for the U.S. with our Federal-State system of government than for European nations with a more centralized form of government.<br>


Bid protest proceedings provide for damages in the case of failure to follow national procurement rules and procedures but do not authorize the set aside of awards.  The agreement also prohibits offsets unless they are by less developed countries and only when negotiated on a countrys entry into the agreement.  Disputes will be settled with the World Trade Organization, the creation of which has become a center of controversy with critics in the Congress contending that the agency has been given powers too broad for an international body.  <P>

<font="+2"><b>Defense Contractors' Leveraged ESOPs.</b></font><br>


Leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) may soon be subject to increased scrutiny by the Department of Defense (DoD) if recommendations made by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) are followed.   In its Report on Department of Defense Oversight of Defense Contractor Pension Plans the OIG concluded that ESOPs are often established simply as a means for disposing of company stock and as a tactic to avoid hostile corporate takeovers.  The report further concluded that the DoD is subsidizing ESOPs that are often created solely for the financial benefit of the corporations and not for the welfare of employees, as intended by Congress.  To address its concerns, the OIG recommended that separate rules for ESOPs be established under the FAR, that the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) closely evaluate whether ESOP costs are allowable and properly allocated to the contract, and that the DCAA consistently question (and presumably disallow) interest expenses on any ESOP loans.<br>

Under a leveraged ESOP, a large block of company stock is purchased with a loan and held in the ESOP trust.  The company then is obligated to make contributions to the ESOP in amounts sufficient to repay principal and interest on the loan.  As the loan is repaid, stock is credited to employee accounts under the ESOP.  The interest paid on the loan often does not translate into a direct benefit to the employees, although the loan may have allowed the ESOP to purchase stock at a price lower than its value when later allocated to accounts.<br>


The treatment of ESOP interest expense under a cost reimbursement type contract has been unclear for some time.  In its report, the OIG recommended that such interest expense be disallowed in all cases under a current provision of the FAR that prohibits reimbursement of interest on company borrowings.  In contrast, DCAA audit guidelines in effect prior to 1993 would have allowed reimbursement of such interest expense because the borrowing is by the ESOP and not the company. <br>


The DCAA recently has changed its view to one more consistent with the position of the OIG.  Audit guidelines issued by the DCAA in 1993 (after the OIG report was circulated in draft) state that the treatment of interest expense depends upon whether the ESOP is a pension plan or deferred compensation plan as those terms are used in the FAR.  If an ESOP has a life annuity payment option for benefits (which is a very unusual feature in an ESOP), the guidelines say that the ESOP is subject to the pension plan rules of the FAR which generally would allow interest expense reimbursement.  If an ESOP does not have a life annuity option, the ESOP would be subject to the deferred compensation plan rules of the FAR which would not allow interest expense reimbursement. <br>


The DCAA has not as yet adopted the position of the OIG with respect to ESOP interest expense.  In responding to the OIGs report recommendation that the DCAA consistently question ESOP interest expense, the DCAA agreed that guidance is needed for consistent treatment of interest expense, but noted that complex accounting and policy issues are involved.  The DCAA promised further audit guidelines after proper coordination with the Office of Defense Procurement.<p>

<H2>Voters Will Grade 1996 Minnesota Legislature and 
Political Parties at November 5 Election</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Faegre & Benson Government Relations Team</h4>



<FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>ajority DFLers point to passage of a livable wage, insurance coverage for 48 hours of hospital care for new mothers and babies, $6 million for summer youth employment, $12 million for K-12 education technology, a crime bill, relaxation of wetlands restrictions and more than $600 million in public construction projects as accomplishments of the 1996 Minnesota Legislature.<p>

The DFL lawmakers say they could have accomplished more - including an increase in the minimum wage to $5.35 an hour from $4.25 - if Gov. Arne Carlson had not used his veto pen 26 times.<p>

Minority Republicans argue the Legislature accomplished little and failed to act on such key issues as legislative reform, overhaul of Minnesotas property tax/state aid system, welfare reform and transportation finance.  The Governor claims his 181 vetoes have saved Minnesotans $1.5 billion since 1991.<p>

Republicans say voters should consider seriously ethics violations by almost a dozen DFL legislators.<p>

Productive year or failure to meet responsibilities?  Minnesota voters will decide how they view the 1996 Legislature when all 201 members of the House and Senate face election on November 5.<p>

Lawmakers came to the Capitol on January 16 with a projected surplus of more than $800 million.  When legislators went home on April 3, they had approved $130 million in new spending and guarded against future federal cutbacks and downturns in the economy by paying back school districts $682 million that the state borrowed more than a decade ago, increasing the budget reserve to $270 million from $220 million and maintaining a $350 million cash flow account.<p>

No taxes were raised or new taxes imposed.<p>

Lawmakers also decided:
<UL>
<LI>To end the search for a new Twin Cities airport.  The airport will stay and expand where it is.
<LI>Not to issue vouchers to low-income families so that their children can attend private or church schools.
</UL>

The 1997 Legislature will convene January 7.<P>

<strong>Wetlands</strong><br>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> two-year debate over changes to a 1991 wetlands law finally ended in a compromise in the final hours of the 1996 legislative session.  Highlights of the new law, effective April 12, include a streamlined and more workable process; increased local control; creation of replacement wetlands on a 1-1 ratio rather than a 2-1 ratio in areas with many wetlands; simplified guidelines for local comprehensive wetland management plans; a de minimis exception; shift of responsibility to the state to replace wetlands drained and filled during local road repair projects; $6 million of state support for wetland restoration and easements; and increased exemptions for public ditch drainage.  A toll-free number will be established to offer assistance to landowners and those with questions on the complex law and regulations.  (Chapter 462.)<p>

<strong>Marketing Claims</strong><br>

A new law places Minnesota in conformity with federal guidelines regulating deceptive trade practices and environmental marketing claims.  Any manufacturer, packager, wholesaler or retailer claiming environmental benefits from products sold in Minnesota must comply with these federal guidelines regarding the accuracy of the claims.  A Minnesota law requiring post-consumer product in recycled material is repealed.  (Chapter 359.)<p>

<strong>Project XL</strong><br>

The Economic Efficiency and Pollution Reduction Act is a pilot program established by the Legislature to encourage innovative compliance by businesses requesting environmental permits from the Pollution Control Agency.  The program gives companies that show excellence and leadership the opportunity to go outside current regulations to increase flexibility and reduce environment management costs in exchange for their efforts to reduce pollution even more than law requires.  The goal is less red tape and less pollution.  The concept was initiated by 3M.  (Chapter 437.)<p>

<strong>Sustainable Development</strong><br>

A new law directs the Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning to develop and publish a sustainable development planning guide for use by local governments and to develop a model sustainable development ordinance.  The planning guide and ordinance are to be based on the principles of sustainable development adopted by the Environmental Quality Board with the advice of the Governors Roundtable on Sustainable Development.  Sustainable development is described as development that maintains or enhances economic opportunity and community well-being while protecting and restoring the natural environment upon which people and economies depend and that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  (Chapter 454.)<p>

<strong>Landfill Cleanup</strong><br>

Negotiations between the Attorney General and the insurance industry resulted in revisions to the process for resolving claims and associated damages incurred in landfill cleanups.  There now is an opportunity for voluntary settlement.  If a settlement cannot be reached after fair and reasonable efforts, the legislation authorizes action by the state for recovery from insurers.  (Chapter 370.)<p>

<strong>Pollution Control Board</strong><br>

Chapter 348 requires that one member of the nine-member Pollution Control Agency Citizens Board must now be a representative of organized labor appointed by the Governor.  The Board currently consists of the Commissioner and eight members appointed by the Governor, including three farmers, two business people, a medical doctor, an attorney for an insurance company and a chief financial officer.  Chapter 405 clarifies the powers and duties of the Citizens Board and Commissioner.  The Board will retain final decisionmaking authority over environmental reviews, permits, variances and agency rules.  The Commissioner will have all duties not expressly designated to the Board.  (Chapters 348 and 405.)<p>

<strong>Kondirator/Steam Plant</strong><br>

Numerous attempts were made by several legislators, including Representative Phyllis Kahn and Senator Larry Pogemiller, during the course of the legislative session to prohibit or slow three projects on the Mississippi River.  The projects are American Iron and Steels proposed metal shredding facility - the Kondirator - in Minneapolis, Alter Steels shredding project in St. Paul and the University of Minnesotas steam plant renovation.  Legislation forcing the projects to meet additional requirements or denying necessary permits was defeated.

<H2>Property Taxes: Very Cold Spring, But No Freeze</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Faegre & Benson Government Relations Team</h4>
<p>



<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he top issue on the 1996 Business legislative agenda was property tax reform.  Reform did not occur, but a foundation was laid for likely action in 1997.<P>

Spurred by complaints from property taxpayers and a growing recognition that Minnesotas property tax/state aid system is broken, lawmakers considered a half dozen proposals to reform the system.<P>

The proposals included:
<UL>
<LI>Narrow the gap between business property taxes - highest in the nation - and taxes on homes and farms.
<LI>Pay all K-12 education expenses with state income and sales taxes instead of using local property taxes to pay much of the bill.
<LI>Establish a new state property tax, extend the sales tax to clothing and consumer services or give local governments power to impose income taxes.
<LI>Pay state property tax relief to taxpayers instead of to local governments.
<LI>Base state aid to local governments on need rather than past spending.
</UL>

Most of the proposals were essentially revenue neutral - lowering property taxes and raising others - at least in the early years.  <p>

Proposed new taxes had the potential to increase total state and local taxes in the future.<p>

A bi-partisan group of senators assembled a reform package, and the Senate Tax Committee passed it to the Senate floor.  <p>

Nervousness over new taxes in an election year caused senators to abandon the reform plan and propose instead a one-year freeze of property taxes and a sunset of the property tax/state aid system in order to encourage reform in 1997.<p>

The House refused to agree to a freeze, arguing that it would tie the hands of local governments as they tried to deal with cutbacks in federal aid and to meet local needs and would lead to higher property taxes after the freeze.<p>

Reform-minded legislators continue to refine and push their proposals, and Governor Carlson has indicated that he may make reform a priority next year.<p>

Lawmakers did pass a scaled-down tax bill (Chapter 471).  It includes:

<UL>
<LI>Reduction of the property tax classification rate for the first $72,000 of cabin value from 1.9 percent to 1.75 percent in 1997 and 1.5 percent in 1998.  The classification rate on the first $72,000 of home value, for comparison, is 1 percent.
<LI>Koch Refinerys plan to build a $300 million electricity cogeneration facility will be aided by passage of an efficiency-based personal property tax exemption for equipment.
</UL>

The Legislature did not approve a phaseout of the sales tax on manufacturers replacement capital equipment.  The phaseout was proposed to help Minnesota manufacturers compete with those in other states.  Proposals to impose a $75 a gram tax on mercury emissions and a $50 a ton tax on carbon in fuel did not pass but are likely to be considered by the 1997 Legislature.

<H2>Airports, Baseball Stadiums and Convention Centers</H2>

<h4>Faegre & Benson Government Relations Team</h4>
<p>



<strong>Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport</strong><br>

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>here was significant debate this session over expansion of the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport or construction of a new airport in Dakota County.<p>

Legislation prohibiting construction of a new airport in Dakota County and outlining the parameters for expansion of the existing airport ignited heated debate on the floors of the Senate and House.  This legislation was ultimately adopted by the Legislature and signed into law (Chapter 464.)<p>

<strong>New Baseball Stadium</strong><br>

A proposal to place a non-binding referendum on the 1996 general election ballot in the Twin Cities area received significant media exposure this year, but made little legislative progress.  The proposed referendum question asked voters whether the Legislature should provide for the construction of a new baseball stadium with a retractable roof using private money and hospitality taxes.<p>

Although the bill died in the middle of session, an interim legislative task force of legislators, business leaders and representatives of Minnesota sports franchises is expected to work on a proposal for construction and financing of a new baseball stadium to be presented to the 1997 Legislature.<P>

<strong>Minneapolis Convention Center</strong><br>

Governor Carlson vetoed $13 million to get started on a $160 million expansion of the Minneapolis Convention Center.  He said sufficient planning had not been done.<p>

The Governor is attempting to assemble a package of public projects, including the Convention Center expansion, for passage in 1997.

<h4>Faegre & Benson Government Relations Team</h4>
<p>



<strong>Securities</strong><br>

Uniform Prudent Investor Act (Chapter 314):  A bill adopting the Uniform Prudent Investor Act was passed in 1996.  This legislation sets standards for investment and management of trust assets by trustees.<P>

Restructured Local Government Investment Law (Chapter 399):  Legislation rewriting local government investment law was passed.  The bill includes provisions allowing local governments to invest in mutual funds which meet rating requirements and have a portfolio with specified characteristics.<P>

<strong>Insurance</strong><BR>

Maternity Stays Coverage (Chapter 335):  This legislation mandates that health care insurance plans cover hospital care for new mothers and their babies for at least 48 hours following childbirth.  In cases involving cesarean sections, patients must be covered for 96 hours.<P>

Prostate Cancer Screening Coverage (Chapter 446):  Health care plans must cover the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test for high-risk men who are 40 years old and all men 50 years of age or older.<P>

Domestic Abuse Victims (Chapter 278):  Legislation was adopted prohibiting health care plans from denying coverage to victims of domestic abuse.  Such discrimination will now be classified as illegal under the Unfair Trade Practices Act.

Lyme Disease Coverage (Chapter 465):  Health care plans are required to include coverage for Lyme disease treatment costs.

<strong>Banking</strong><BR>

The 1996 Omnibus Financial Institutions Bill (Chapter 414) made numerous changes to Minnesota banking laws.  The bills provisions include:<P>

<H2>Gas Tax 
and Speed Limits</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Faegre & Benson Government Relations Team</h4>
<p>



<STRONG>Gas Tax</STRONG><BR>


For much of the past decade, lawmakers have debated numerous proposals to provide increased funding for highways and transit.  Each year the debate has resulted in a stalemate.  Although nearly everyone agrees on the need for increased funding, the Legislature is split into divisive factions.  Rural legislators generally favor a gas tax increase to fund construction of highways and bridges.  Legislators representing the core cities are most concerned about funding for transit.  They are reluctant to increase the gas tax, which is dedicated constitutionally to roads and bridges, without support from rural legislators for a new revenue source dedicated to transit.  Suburban legislators are split between the two camps.<P>

During the past two years, Senate leaders have managed to reconcile their differences and pass several proposals providing for increased funding for transportation.  One proposal, which did not survive in 1996, would have increased the gas tax by 5 cents a gallon and authorized a ½ percent sales tax in the Twin Cities area to fund transit.<P>

In the House, leaders have been unable to forge a coalition to adopt any significant funding proposal.  While various committees in the House have approved proposals, the full House never has been supportive of proposals to increase taxes to fund transportation improvements.<P>

While Governor Carlson has shown interest in supporting a modest gas tax increase of 2 to 5 cents, he has not become actively involved in forging a compromise and resolving the stalemate.<P>

Although legislators, Carlson Administration officials and representatives of the transportation industry devoted considerable energy to the issue of transportation funding, no proposal was adopted during the 1996 legislative session.  The Governor and Legislature will set the biennial budget in 1997, providing increased visibility for highway and transit funding issues.<P>

<STRONG>Speed Limits</STRONG><BR>

The Legislature adopted a bill authorizing an increase in the speed limit to 65 m.p.h. on rural, divided highways.  The Governor opposed the increase unless additional officers were added to the State Patrol.  Because the speed limit bill contained many other transportation provisions, the Governor signed the bill and ordered the Commissioner of Transportation to keep the speed limit to 55 m.p.h. under his discretionary power to maintain safe roadways.  (Chapter 455.)

<H2>Corporate Welfare and the Livable Wage</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Faegre & Benson Government Relations Team</h4>
<p>



<FONT SIZE=+1>M</FONT>innesota received national attention this year as lawmakers decided that some businesses receiving public subsidies must pay employees a livable wage.  Look for future assaults on tax breaks and other forms of alleged corporate welfare.<P>

Livable Wage:  Legislation mandating that businesses receiving public grants or loans pay employees at least a livable wage equal to the federal poverty level for a family of four - now $7.28/hour - including health and dental care passed both houses, but was vetoed by the Governor.  This bill would have affected businesses which receive at least $25,000 in state or local economic development assistance.<P>

Minimum Wage:  A bill which would have raised the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.35 an hour at large companies and from $4 an hour to $5 an hour at small companies - maximum gross annual sales of $500,000 - sparked significant debate in 1996.  This bill also was vetoed by the Governor.<P>

Livable Wage (Chapter 447):  Similar to the vetoed proposal mandating a wage increase to $7.28/hour, the 1996 Omnibus Jobs Bill contained provisions requiring companies receiving financial assistance from the Minnesota Investment Fund, formerly known as the Economic Recovery Grant Program, to pay a minimum wage of $8.01 an hour including benefits.  This proposal survived because it was incorporated into a bill which contained numerous initiatives that the Governor wanted enacted into law, such as a $6 million youth summer employment program.  All Economic Recovery Grant recipients are already paying at least $8.01 an hour.<P>

Other employment laws approved include:<P>
School Activities Leave (Chapter 341): The Parental Leave Law allowing a parent or guardian employed by an employer for 12 consecutive months to take unpaid time off in order to attend his or her childs school conference or classroom activity was expanded to enable a parent or guardian to qualify for unpaid leave immediately upon employment and to include school-related activities.<P>

Enforcement of Wage and Hour Laws (Chapter 386):  Under a new law, employees are entitled to bring direct action in district court for unpaid wages, damages, costs and attorneys fees.  Also, the Commissioner of Labor and Industry may hold employers liable for failing to comply with minimum wage and wage and hour laws by ordering civil penalties and reimbursement for litigation costs born by employees.<P>

The minimum wage is likely to be debated during the 1996 election and probably will resurface during the 1997 legislative session.  Opponents will continue to argue that the federal government, not the Legislature, should determine the minimum wage.  Proponents will urge the Legislature to provide leadership on the issue rather than wait for federal action.<P>

<H2>Miscellaneous Laws</h2>



<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Faegre & Benson Government Relations Team</h4>

Child Boating Safety Act (Chapter 396):  There was emotional discussion of the Aaron Sahli Child Boating Safety Act during the 1996 legislative session.  This legislation sets age requirements for operating motorboats and jet skis.  Use of motorized watercraft by all persons under 18 is regulated.  Children under 12 cannot operate motorboats larger than 75 horsepower; those under 13 cannot operate personal watercraft.  The new law was proposed after last years death of 10-year-old Aaron Sahli, who died after the pontoon-boat he was in was struck by a powerboat being driven by an 8-year-old.<p>

Pedestrian Right-of-Way (Chapter 333):  The Legislature enacted a law which makes failure of a driver to stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk a gross misdemeanor on second offense.<p>

Pawn Shop Regulation (Chapter 404):  Legislation was enacted which sets statewide standards regulating pawn-brokers.  The new law still allows local governments to exercise some regulatory authority over pawn-brokers.<p>

Slamming (Chapter 340):  The Legislature responded to consumer complaints that some telephone companies have been changing customers long-distance telephone services without customer authorization - a practice known as slamming.  The law makes slamming illegal in Minnesota.<p>

Internet Information Disclosure:  Legislation requiring a study of consumer privacy rights with regard to on-line computer services was introduced in 1996, but failed in the House.  The bill also set minimum privacy standards.<p>

Mail Balloting:  A proposal to facilitate mail balloting in some cities and towns was passed by the House and Senate, but vetoed by the Governor.  Currently, only cities and towns outside the Twin Cities area that have fewer than 400 registered voters can conduct balloting by mail.  The bill would have increased that limit to 1,000 registered voters.<p>

Handguns:  A provision which would have loosened requirements to carry a handgun was adopted by the House, but not the Senate.<p>

Vouchers:  Governor Carlsons K-12 education vouchers proposal was defeated in committee in 1996.  His proposal would have appropriated $15 million for a pilot program to test a plan allowing low-income students in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Brooklyn Center and an outstate school district to transfer $3,000 in public funding to a non-public school of his or her choice.<p>

Toll Road Hearings (Chapter 455):  Before a toll road can be constructed, the Minnesota Department of Transportation must hold public meetings in every county affected by the proposal.<p>

Recall (Chapter 429):  Voters will decide in the 1996 election whether they want to amend the Minnesota Constitution to allow recall of legislators in cases of serious malfeasance or non-feasance in office or conviction of a serious crime.<p>

New Prison (Chapter 463):  Issuance of $89 million in bonds was authorized for construction of an 800-bed prison.<p>

Tort Reform:  A proposal to require defendants to be 51 percent at fault before being held 100 percent liable under joint and several liability was defeated.

<H2>New Federal Antitrust Rules:  Opportunities and Challenges for Physicians and Hospitals</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_dnvr.html#niederman">Gerald A. Niederman</a> and <a href="../offices/att_dnvr.html#bowman">Laury E. Bowman</a></h4>
<p>


Physicians and hospitals have long complained that overly restrictive antitrust rules have impeded the development of beneficial, provider-owned alternatives to insurer- and HMO-controlled health plans, to the ultimate detriment of health care consumers.  On August 28, 1996, in a promising new development, the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (the "Agencies") released revised "Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Health Care" (the "Revised Statements") indicating  that the Agencies have relaxed certain key enforcement positions concerning physician and multiprovider networks.<P>

The Revised Statements mark a significant departure from earlier enforcement policies issued in September 1994 (the 1994 Statements), and suggest that a more diverse array of integrated health care delivery systems may receive more lenient antitrust treatment.  Most notably, the Agencies have stated that:<P>

<UL type=disc>
<LI>Formerly prohibited agreements to set prices among providers in a network which does not share economic risk will now be evaluated under a flexible rule of reason standard of antitrust legality, and may therefore be upheld as lawful, so long as the providers are "substantially integrated" and such agreements are reasonably necessary to achieve the networks procompetitive benefits; and
<p> 
<LI>The critical concept of "substantial integration" has been broadened to encompass a more expansive examination of a networks overall clinical integration (e.g., medical management activities), in addition to more conventional indicators of shared economic risk, when evaluating whether providers are in fact "substantially integrated" for antitrust purposes.

</UL>

The Agencies have further clarified their enforcement orientation by providing additional examples of provider joint ventures which may not be challenged in view of an arrangements overall procompetitive impact in the health care marketplace.<P>

Although the Revised Statements also raise potentially significant questions which could present concerns in some settings (e.g., regarding permissible market share and exclusivity), the new rules represent a welcome change, the net effect of which should be to promote new provider alliances and more dynamic competition in many communities.


<H4>Analytic Background</H4>
Consistent with conventional antitrust principles, the Agencies generally take one of two approaches to evaluating providers conduct in health care enforcement actions:  certain activities are classified as "per se" (i.e., presumed) illegal while other activities are judged under the more detailed "rule of reason" approach which evaluates the actual impact of an activity on competition in the marketplace.  (These approaches also mirror the legal standards applicable to private antitrust suits.)  Under the per se approach, some activities undertaken by competitors (including hospitals and physicians) are viewed as being so inherently injurious to competition that they are automatically condemned as illegal.  For example, naked agreements between competing providers that fix prices or divide markets are automatically illegal under the per se rule; such arrangements cannot be defended on the basis of their alleged beneficial character in particular circumstances.<P>

Conversely, under the rule of reason analysis, the Agencies (or the courts in a judicial context) evaluate whether the positive impact on competition arising from particular challenged activities outweighs any alleged anticompetitive effects resulting from those activities.  In conducting rule of reason analysis, it is necessary to:  (1) define the relevant marketplace in which health care services are delivered;  (2) ascertain any anticompetitive effects of the provider network; (3) weigh any anticompetitive effects against procompetitive efficiencies achieved by the same activities; and (4) examine the collateral effects of the activities on participants conduct outside of the provider network joint venture.  Following a detailed factual inquiry, if the procompetitive efficiencies are found on balance to outweigh any anticompetitive effects, the conduct will not be deemed unlawful.<p>

In the 1994 Statements, the Agencies set forth illustrations of the per se and rule of reason criteria, and designated several safety zones outlining arrangements in which providers may engage in certain activities which the Agencies would not challenge under either the per se test or the rule of reason standard, absent extraordinary circumstances.  Many physicians and hospitals have regarded these safety zones as unduly narrow and unrealistic (particularly regarding their one-dimensional emphasis on the use of a  "messenger model" pricing methodology), thereby disadvantaging provider networks vis-&Agrave;-vis insurers and HMOs which are not so limited in their negotiating posture.<P>

In the Revised Statements the Agencies have taken a large step towards creating a more level playing field.  The Revised Statements indicate that certain activities of provider-controlled joint ventures - notably physician networks and multiprovider networks, including doctors, hospitals and other practitioners - may no longer face per se antitrust condemnation based upon collective pricing arrangements if the networks generate significant efficiencies (evaluated under the newly broadened standard of substantial integration) which ultimately benefit health care consumers in an overall market setting.  The Agencies have not changed the contours of the previously defined safety zones.  However, the Revised Statements provide further examples of integrated delivery systems which, although falling beyond the literal ambit of the safety zones, may nonetheless be upheld as lawful under the more flexible rule of reason since such innovative horizontal and vertical arrangements may in fact yield beneficial procompetitive efficiencies.  This change should encourage a more dynamic health care marketplace in which physicians and hospitals can compete more effectively based upon price and quality variables.<P>

The Revised Statements are detailed and the examples presented should be carefully reviewed to maximize antitrust compliance in a given instance.  Against this background, the remainder of this article highlights several key aspects of the new guidelines which may be of particular importance to doctors, hospitals and other providers.

<H4>Physician Network Joint Ventures</H4>
The Revised Statements recognize some of the remarkable changes occurring in the contemporary health care industry, and that physicians in particular have radically changed both the manner and the means through which health care services are delivered in response to market demands for reduced costs and continued quality.  The Agencies have acknowledged that physician networks not fitting perfectly within the narrow safety zones enumerated in the 1994 Statements may still have significant procompetitive benefits for the consuming public.  Applying this more tolerant perspective, the Agencies have modified their enforcement approach to physician network joint ventures in at least two substantial ways.  The government also reiterated the previously articulated principle that networks falling beyond specific safety zones are not necessarily unlawful and must be examined on a case by case basis.<P>

<STRONG>Agreements to Set Prices</STRONG>  The Revised Statements confirm that physicians who are otherwise competitors outside of their participation in a network may agree to collectively set prices for services delivered through the network if the network is sufficiently integrated.  The Agencies have meaningfully expanded the means through which the requisite integration can be demonstrated.  In this context, collective agreement to set prices must in all circumstances be characterized as reasonably necessary for the physician network joint venture to achieve the kinds of significant efficiencies that benefit consumers in the marketplace.<P>

For example, if an agreement among physician network participants provides demonstrable incentives for the physicians to cooperate in lowering costs and improving quality through the management of covered services, the Agencies may not view the agreement as per se illegal (in contrast to naked price fixing arrangements which do nothing more than create a cartel and which are still automatically condemned).  Even integrated arrangements may still be subject to potentially burdensome and expensive factual review under the rule of reason, and may still be judged unlawful depending upon specific facts if, like many such ventures, they fall outside the narrow safety zones.  Nonetheless, the physicians under scrutiny would now be permitted to defend the underlying arrangement on the grounds that it was ultimately procompetitive, rather than facing automatic condemnation under the harsh per se criteria.<P>

<STRONG>"Sufficient Integration"</STRONG>  The Agencies previously articulated a single litmus test to gauge the existence of "integration" sufficient to trigger rule of reason analysis.  Under the 1994 Statements as applied, in order for physician networks to qualify for favored treatment under the safety zones or otherwise, such networks had to prove that they shared substantial financial risk in a narrowly defined manner.  The Agencies rationale for this requirement was (and is) that sharing substantial financial risk is a "bright line" test indicating that sufficient integration exists between physicians to generate significant procompetitive benefits for purchasers of health care.  Thus, the Agencies previously opined that the requisite sharing of substantial financial risk could be achieved by a networks accepting capitated payment for services delivered, or through the withholding of a substantial sum from reimbursement otherwise due to physician participants which is subject to redistribution, if at all, on some basis other than individual productivity.<P>

In a significant departure from their previous pronouncements, the Agencies have now shifted their focus away from the limited issue of shared financial risk to a broader examination of whether a physician network is sufficiently integrated in an economic or clinical sense so as to justify rule of reason treatment.  While not a panacea for loosely-linked groups seeking to oppose managed care penetration or to forestall price competition, this broadened view of integration may offer substantial new opportunities for emerging networks.<P>

The Agencies have reiterated the view that the sharing of substantial financial risk remains an indicator that physician participants in the network are mutually motivated to control costs and to improve the quality of care - the desired and lawful result of integration.  However, the Agencies have expanded their view of other arrangements which may also yield the same legitimate results.  For example, networks which are "clinically integrated" may now meet the Agencies rule of reason standard, even if they do not limit themselves to acceptance of capitated reimbursement or otherwise share financial risk in the narrow sense.<P>

In functional terms, the Agencies current view of clinical integration largely overlaps with contemporary medical management activities, and apparently includes genuine utilization review, outcomes measurement and quality improvement programs implemented by many networks as an overall competitive strategy.  Thus, depending on market share, exclusivity of participation and other circumstances, a physician network that engages in substantial medical management may be deemed sufficiently integrated to uphold a collective fee agreement under the rule of reason, even though the network only accepts discounted fee-for-service reimbursement and does not implement other conventional economic risk sharing mechanisms.  For networks too large to fit within the safety zone, whether such non-economic integration is sufficient to allow more lenient rule of reason treatment is a determination that must be made in light of each networks particular facts and circumstances.<P>

The overriding structural and functional attributes of a particular network still require careful examination and planning to maximize compliance with antitrust requirements under the Revised Statements.  The new rules are likely to provide legal benefits and enhanced strategic opportunities for many provider groups.  However, they may complicate the initial factual and legal review necessary to assess the current legitimacy of a particular physician network under the more desirable (but more fact-intensive) rule of reason standard.

<H4>Multiprovider Networks</H4>
The Agencies have reiterated their previously expressed view that multiprovider networks, including physician-hospital organizations ("PHOs") - which vary greatly in their composition, nature and size - may produce procompetitive efficiencies.  In their current approach to multiprovider networks, the Agencies incorporate their more relaxed views on pricing agreements, discussed above, which apply to the physician network context.  Thus, in the Revised Statements, the Agencies acknowledge that multiprovider networks may achieve sufficient integration to be validated under the rule of reason analysis through such forms of clinical integration as genuine medical management, apart from the conventional standard of shared financial risk which has colored past decision-making.<P>

<STRONG>New Examples</STRONG>  The Revised Statements provide four new examples of multiprovider networks to illustrate application of the broadened standards.  In one example, the Agencies state that a non-exclusive PHO located in a medium-sized city would be analyzed under the rule of reason where the PHO members operated on a fee-for-service basis and had invested capital to purchase and operate a medical management information system to report on the cost, quantity and nature of services rendered, apart from implementing utilization review and quality assurance programs.  The Agencies concluded that they would not challenge such a PHO in view of its apparent clinical integration, because there were numerous other non-network providers in the community, and because the PHO operations would likely generate significant efficiencies for affected consumers.  As suggested above, however, such a conclusion is inherently fact-specific and in the event of legal scrutiny would only be rendered after careful review of the particular circumstances of the case.<P>

In another example, the Agencies hypothesized a PHO which had as its members all of the physicians in a small rural community.  The physicians did not participate in the PHO on an exclusive basis, but did accept scheduled discounts from their current fee-for-service charges.  The PHO additionally devised a bonus structure of up to twenty percent of total payments received if participating physicians met utilization targets.<P>

The Agencies indicated that they would not challenge the formation and operation of such a PHO under a rule of reason analysis since the PHO would not appear to limit competition in any relevant marketplace and had potential to create significant efficiencies.  The Agencies opined that the PHOs agreement to set a fee schedule was consistent with the physician participants overall risk-sharing approach to the venture, and was thus deemed reasonably necessary for the PHO to achieve its procompetitive efficiencies.<P> 

An interesting aspect of the latter example for some rural or non-metropolitan networks is the expression of a new rationale to justify participation in the PHO by a very large percentage of community physicians: the need to respond to competitive pressure from other providers and managed care plans in the nearby "Big City" environment.  The Agencies stated that since involvement of all local physicians would be necessary to respond to competitive pressure from Big City providers, and since physician participants have manifested a genuine willingness to enter into agreements outside of the PHO (i.e., the arrangement is demonstrably non-exclusive), the Agencies would not challenge the PHO.

<H4>Summary</H4>
The Agencies have clearly changed their enforcement perspectives concerning physician network joint ventures and multispecialty provider networks that meet the more flexible standard of financial or clinical integration.  However, the government has also reiterated its position that each venture falling outside the existing safety zones will be evaluated individually based upon the relevant facts involving a given network.  The Agencies have also admonished that they will concentrate on the substance of actual activities undertaken by physician or multispecialty networks, and will determine whether the providers joint activities result in any procompetitive benefits for health care consumers.<P>

Other issues such as exclusivity (in substance as well as form), market share (especially in non-metropolitan communities) and the possibility of "spillover" collusion outside the network are likely to be relevant in future determinations.  Some of these issues may be clarified through future advisory opinions rendered by the Agencies in response to specific inquiries.  Moreover, even though it has been reduced in importance, the "messenger model" of network operations does retain importance for non-risk sharing networks in some circumstances.<P>

Notwithstanding the unresolved issues, the Agencies have communicated a positive approach reasonably aimed at encouraging provider innovation and procompetitive behavior, without dispensing with the need for detailed and ongoing antitrust compliance review.  Physicians, hospitals and other providers should carefully review the Revised Statements and consider their application to the ongoing development and implementation of successful and lawful integrated delivery systems.

<H2>Eighth Circuit Refuses To Adopt Hanlester Decision</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_mpls.html#schroeder">Thomas S. Schroeder</a></h4>
<p>


For Medicare and Medicaid providers and their attorneys waiting to see whether the Eighth Circuit would adopt the decidedly provider-friendly decision by the Ninth Circuit in the Hanlester case, the answer is in.<P>

"We dont think so," the federal appellate court with jurisdiction over Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri seemed to say in an August 8, 1996 ruling.  <EM>See United States v. Jain</EM>, Nos. 95-2820, 95-3036 [1996 WL 444885].  Rejecting the more stringent scienter requirement applied in the Hanlester case, <EM>Jain</EM> serves as a warning that providers in the Eighth Circuit may be found in violation of the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback statute regardless of whether they knew their conduct violated the statute, so long as they knew their conduct was inherently "wrongful."  

<H4>Facts in <EM>Jain</EM></H4>  
In <EM>Jain</EM>, psychologist Swaran Kumar and his corporation, the Center for Mental Health Services, Inc., appealed their convictions for violating the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback statute (commonly referred to as the "fraud and abuse" provisions) and federal mail fraud statutes.  Justice Department prosecutors alleged that Dr. Jain, a psychologist in private practice who operated an outpatient therapy clinic and supervised several affiliated psychologists and counselors, had received payments for referring patients to North Hills Hospital in Kansas City, an acute-care psychiatric hospital.<P>

North Hills former hospital administrators testified that they paid Dr. Jain $1,000 per month for "marketing" - payments that in fact were in exchange for patient referrals.  Dr. Jain allegedly provided little if any tangible marketing support, yet the administrators testified that he demanded increased payments from North Hills and threatened to refer his patients elsewhere if his demands were not met.  In all, North Hills made nineteen payments to Dr. Jain between July 1989 and October 1990 totalling $40,500.  During this same period, Dr. Jain referred 49 patients to North Hills, 30 of whom were insured by the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services ("CHAMPUS"), and one of whom was a Medicare beneficiary.<P>

The jury convicted Dr. Jain and his corporation on all nineteen counts contained in the governments indictment.  Dr. Jain was sentenced to five years probation, six months home detention and a $10,000 fine.  The defendants appealed their convictions, arguing that the trial courts jury instruction had erroneously defined the term "willfully" in the anti-kickback statute.<P>

The anti-kickback statute makes it a felony to "knowingly and willfully solicit or receive any remuneration" in return for referrals of Medicare patients.  Dr. Jain argued that an instruction similar to that required by the Ninth Circuit in <EM>Hanlester</EM> should have been used-namely, that conviction under the statute required the government to prove that the defendants had intentionally violated a known legal duty.

<H4>Taking a Middle Course</H4>
Both the trial and appellate courts disagreed with Dr. Jain, and in the process ended speculation concerning whether the <EM>Hanlester</EM> decisions heightened scienter requirement would be adopted in the Eighth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit ruled in <EM>Hanlester Network v. Shalala</EM>, 51 F.3d 1390 (9th Cir. 1995), that joint ventures involving physician self-referrals could not give rise to criminal liability absent proof of both: (1) an awareness that the arrangement was prohibited under the anti-kickback statute; and (2) a specific intent to disobey the law.  The United States Supreme Court denied review of <EM>Hanlester</EM>, ignoring the pleas of more than a dozen states attorneys general who had filed or joined in amicus briefs urging review and reversal of the controversial decision.<P>

The trial court in <EM>Jain</EM> charted a middle course between the instruction sought by the government and the more rigorous instruction now applied in <EM>Hanlester</EM> jurisdictions.  The court declined to apply the governments proposed instruction - that "willfully" requires mere consciousness of the act but not consciousness that the act was unlawful - reasoning that such a lax scienter requirement might encompass some types of innocent conduct.  On the other hand, the court refused to instruct the jury that in order to be convicted, the defendant must have intentionally violated a known legal duty.  The court observed that the anti-kickback statute prohibited willful conduct rather than willful violations of the statute.  Fashioning its own compromise between the governments and Dr. Jains proposed instructions, the court instructed the jury that "the word willfully means unjustifiably and wrongfully, known to be such by the defendant."

<H4>Hanlester Criticized</H4>
The Eighth Circuit affirmed the instruction.  The appellate court conceded along with the trial court that the anti-kickback statute may potentially criminalize "conduct that is not inevitably nefarious."  Nonetheless, the appellate court made clear its view that the <EM>Hanlester</EM> decision had gone too far in attempting to safeguard innocent defendants from conviction:

<blockquote>
Both the plain language of the [anti-kickback] statute, and respect for the traditional principle that ignorance of the law is no defense, suggest that a heightened mens rea standard should only require proof that Dr. Jain knew that his conduct was wrongful, rather than proof that he knew it violated "a known legal duty."
</blockquote>

Even after distinguishing <EM>Hanlester</EM> as involving "an administrative debarment proceeding," the court went out of its way to criticize the Ninth Circuits creation of Hanlesters rigorous scienter standard "without considering other alternatives."<p>

The lesson from <EM>Jain</EM> is that while ignorance of the law - and in particular, ignorance of what constitutes a violation of the anti-kickback statute - may be a defense in jurisdictions where Hanlester defines the intent requirement, such ignorance is not a defense within the Eighth Circuit.  The federal district court for the southern district of Ohio (<EM>U.S. v. Neufeld</EM>) and a Florida state appellate court  (<EM>Medical Development Network, Inc. v. Professional Respiratory Care</EM>) had previously declined to adopt <EM>Hanlester</EM>, but <EM>Jain</EM> marks the first federal circuit court decision to do so.

Because of the legal conflict between the circuits created by <EM>Hanlester</EM> and <EM>Jain</EM>, the Supreme Court may choose to review the issue if Dr. Jain and his clinic file an appeal.  Such a prospect is sure to keep providers and their attorneys guessing for several more months about precisely what level of intent is required to establish a violation of the anti-kickback statute.

<H2>Court Allows Private Plaintiff to Bring Fraud and Abuse Claim</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_mpls.html#schroeder">Thomas S. Schroeder</a></h4>
<p>


Adding to a sparse but growing line of cases, a federal district court in Tennessee recently reversed its own prior ruling and held that private plaintiffs may sue health care providers under the so-called "<EM>qui tam</EM>" provisions of the federal False Claims Act based solely on allegations that the providers violated the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, the "Stark" anti-referral law, or similar state fraud and abuse and anti-referral laws.   If followed in other jurisdictions, the decision in <EM>United States ex rel. Pogue v. American Healthcorp, Inc.</EM>, 914 F.Supp. 1507 (M.D. Tenn. 1996), could lead to the effective "privatization" of enforcement actions under the fraud and abuse and Stark laws, the extension of False Claims Act liability beyond its traditional realm of fraudulent billing, and a dramatic increase in health care providers exposure under all three laws.

<H4>The Allegations</H4>
The plaintiff in <EM>Pogue</EM>, a former director for marketing and development at Diabetes Treatment Centers of America, Inc. ("DTCA"), filed suit on behalf of the government against DTCA, its parent company American Health-corp, Inc., West Paces Medical Center in Atlanta, Georgia (the "Hospital") and five physician staff members of the Hospital.  In <EM>Pogues</EM> third amended complaint, Pogue alleged that the Hospital had contracted with DTCA to pay DTCA a fee based on the number of diabetes patients DTCA admitted to the Hospital.  DTCA in turn entered into a medical directors contract with one of the five defendant physicians, and service contracts with the remaining physicians-contracts which Pogue claims amounted to a disguised fee-for-referral arrangement designed to reward the physicians for admitting their patients, including Medicare and Medicaid patients, to the Hospital.  Pogues federal complaint alleged that these contractual arrangements violated the Medicare Fraud & Abuse Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), as well as the prohibited referral provisions contained in the Stark law, 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn(a)(1). <P>

The <EM>qui tam</EM> provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733 (the "Act"), allow any private party to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government against any person or entity that "knowingly" presents a "false or fraudulent claim" for payment to the government.  Penalties under the Act include a civil fine of between $5,000 and $10,000 for each false claim, three times the amount of damages sustained by the government, and payment of the governments (or qui tam plaintiffs) costs and attorneys fees.<P>

Although the Act defines "knowing" to include deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the falsity or fraudulent nature of the claim being presented, the Act nowhere defines what makes a claim "false or fraudulent."  Past courts have ruled that the claim at issue-in the health care context, frequently a Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement claim form such as Form 1450 or 1500-must contain misrepresentations which render them false or fraudulent on their face.  
In contrast, Pogues complaint did not allege that there was anything facially wrong with DTCAs cost reports or claims forms, nor that the services provided were unnecessary or over-billed.  Rather, Pogue asserted that the defendants claims were fraudulent because by submitting their claims for reimbursement, the defendants were "implicitly" representing their compliance with all of the statutes, rules and regulations governing the Medicare act, including the fraud and abuse and Stark laws.  In short, Pogue claimed that any violation of either the fraud and abuse or Stark laws automatically resulted in a violation of the False Claims Act, under which anyone could sue for damages as a <EM>qui tam</EM> plaintiff.<P>

<H4>The Courts Decision</H4>
Vacating an earlier decision it had issued to the contrary in September of last year, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee agreed with <EM>Pogue</EM> and refused to allow dismissal of the case.  While recognizing an earlier admonition of the United States Supreme Court that the False Claims Act "was not designed to reach every kind of fraud practiced on the Government," the court nonetheless held that the Act "was intended to cover not only those situations in which the claims themselves are false but also those situations in which a claimant engages in fraudulent conduct with the purpose of inducing payment by the government."  914 F. Supp. at 1511.<P>

Nevertheless, the court emphasized that it would not permit the transformation of the Act into a "stalking horse for enforcement of every statute, rule and regulation," and it reiterated that Pogue could proceed with his claim "only if he can show that Defendants engaged in the fraudulent conduct with the purpose of inducing payment from the government."  Id. at 1513 (emphasis added).
Despite this cautionary language, the courts decision, coupled with its September 1995 unpublished decision on the defendants motion to dismiss, creates a second ominous precedent for health care providers that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  In its September ruling, the same court had ruled that a comprehensive release and waiver signed by Pogue in May of 1994-only a month before Pogue filed his False Claims Act lawsuit-did not bar Pogue from filing his qui tam suit against DTCA and its parent company American Healthcorp.  In the release, Pogue represented that he was "releas[ing] and forever discharg[ing]" DTCA and its parent company "from any and all claims [or] causes of action . . . whatsoever at law or equity, in state or federal court."<P>

Although such broad releases are routinely sought by employers and enforced by courts in post-termination employment suits, the Tennessee court ruled that <EM>Pogues</EM> release was unenforceable as against public policy, stating:  "the public interest in detecting fraud on the government, which the [False Claims Act] seeks to promote, would be substantially impaired by the enforcement of the release[.]"  <EM>Pogue</EM>, 1995 WL 626514, *4 (Sept. 14, 1995 Memorandum Order).

<H4>A Trend of Two?</H4>
In reaching its holding, the court in Pogue cited a "recent trend of cases" allowing False Claims Act lawsuits based on fraud and abuse or Stark violations, relying most heavily on a recent decision by a federal court in Ohio that drew a similar conclusion.  In <EM>United States ex rel. Roy v. Anthony</EM>, 914 F.Supp. 1504 (S.D. Ohio 1994),  the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio allowed a <EM>qui tam</EM> suit to proceed against a network of medical imaging companies that provided X-rays, MRIs, and CT-scans, together with their physician-shareholders, officers and directors, even though the court conceded that the "vague assertions" contained in the plaintiffs complaint created only "a tenuous connection" between the fraud and abuse statute and the False Claims Act.  <EM>Id</EM>. at 1506.  Despite the <EM>Pogue</EM> courts reference to a "trend" favoring such suits, thus far the trend extends no further than the decisions in <EM>Roy</EM> and <EM>Pogue</EM>.<P>

An equally significant aspect of the <EM>Pogue</EM> case is the courts finding that the False Claims Act "clearly prohibits fraudulent acts even if they do not cause a loss to the government."  914 F.Supp. at 1513.  The court recognized that "there is no allegation that the Defendants overcharged Medicare or charged it for services not rendered[.]"  <EM>Id</EM>. at 1510.  Yet the court held that Pogue was not required to allege facts regarding actual damages.  The False Claims Act, the court stated, "was intended to govern not only fraudulent acts that create a loss to the government but also those fraudulent acts that cause the government to pay out sums of money to claimants it did not intend to benefit."  <EM>Id</EM>.
 
<H4>Impact on Providers</H4>
The decision in <EM>Pogue</EM> carries precedential weight only within the Middle District of Tennessee.  However, given the paucity of decisions addressing the relationship between the False Claims Act and the fraud and abuse/Stark laws, Pogue is likely to be cited by <EM>qui tam</EM> plaintiffs across the country as persuasive authority.  For that reason, the decision and the trend it may presage are attracting considerable attention from lawyers and health care professionals alike.<P>

Observers critical of the <EM>Pogue</EM> decision have raised two general objections.  First, both the <EM>Stark</em> statute and the anti-kickback statute provide detailed remedies and penalties for their violation, including civil and criminal fines, imprisonment and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Notably absent from these remedies is a private right of action for damages, a remedy which Congress might easily have created had it so intended.  The decisions in Roy and Pogue create such a remedy as a matter of common law, and thereby subject health care providers to a wholly new set of liabilities under the fraud and abuse and Stark laws-including money damages to private litigants, a different type of statutory penalty, and inevitably greater exposure to frivolous plaintiffs suits.  This objection was the focus of an appeal filed in March by DTCA and American Healthcorp with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.  However, largely for procedural reasons, the Sixth Circuit refused to hear the appeal.<P>

Second, with regard to the Stark law in particular, observers have expressed alarm that Roy and Pogue permit an end-run of the scienter requirement in the False Claims Act.  As noted above, the most frequently invoked provisions of the Act require the plaintiff to show that the defendant acted "knowingly" in submitting the false claim.  The Stark law, in contrast, is essentially a strict liability statute whose penalties are triggered by referrals when certain relationships exist, without regard to providers intent or knowledge in entering into those relationships or making the referrals.  While the scienter requirement formulated in the Ninth Circuits April 1995 opinion in <EM>Hanlester Network v. Shalala</EM>, 51 F.3d 1390 (9th Cir. 1995), provides some protections against False Claims Act lawsuits bootstrapped from federal fraud and abuse violations, providers may find it far more difficult to dismiss <EM>qui tam</EM> actions premised upon conclusory allegations of Stark violations.<P>

It remains to be seen whether the courts decision in <EM>Pogue</EM> is a harbinger of a new wave of <EM>qui tam</EM> actions based on alleged fraud and abuse and Stark law violations, or whether the decision is simply a blip on the map of often contradictory False Claims Act caselaw.  Rather than waiting to find out, providers would be well advised to put in place effective compliance programs that identify liability hazards before they become qui tam lawsuits.

<H2>Colorado Issues Proposed Regulations for Risk-Bearing Provider Networks</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_dnvr.html#bowman">Laury E. Bowman</a></h4>
<p>


Continuing its efforts to keep pace with rapidly evolving health care delivery systems, the Colorado Division of Insurance (the Division) recently issued proposed regulations which potentially impact a broad spectrum of health care providers in Colorado.  Numerous other states are closely following the Divisions regulatory process, and some can be expected to issue similar regulations.

<H4>Overview of the Proposed Regulations</H4>
The proposed regulations would require limited service licensed provider networks (referred to as LSLPNs) to obtain a license from the Division before entering into health care services agreements if providers are at risk for the services they deliver.  For example, the regulations would require LSLPNs to obtain a license prior to agreeing to deliver health care services to a self-funded employer in exchange for a capitated payment.  In its proposed regulations, the Division defines a capitated payment in part as payment to a health care provider that is based on the exposure to provide certain health care services to covered persons but does not vary on the basis of the number or type of services actually rendered.  The Division explains that agreements to deliver health care services on a capitated basis transfer risk to providers, and thus constitute the business of insurance.  Under the Divisions rationale, providers who accept capitated payment must obtain a license before transacting the business of insurance.

<H4>Scope of the Proposed Regulations</H4>
In public hearings held in May, several commentators requested clarification regarding the scope of the proposed  regulations.  The regulations define an LSLPN as a provider or provider network which directly contracts with consumers for services restricted to a medical specialty or services limited to a single type of licensed medical facility.  The definition of an LSLPN, however, also states that the LSLPNs services must, in the opinion of the [Colorado Commissioner of Insurance], fall significantly short of those offered by a health maintenance organization or under a comprehensive or major medical policy. <P>

It is unclear whether the proposed regulations in effect create a regulatory niche for those types of services which are typically carved out of  comprehensive or major medical policies (for example, mental health services).  If so, the regulations would allow providers of those services to obtain, in essence, a limited service HMO license.  If the Division adopts this more restricted approach, some physician-hospital organizations (PHOs) and independent practice associations (IPAs) may be required to obtain full-blown HMO licenses, which can be time-consuming and costly.  Conversely, the regulations may apply more broadly to  PHOs or to IPAs which provide multiple medical services that are not comprehensive in scope and that do not include many of the services encompassed by major medical policies.<P>

The Division may provide clarification on the scope of its proposed regulations in future drafts.  It is clear for now, however, that provider networks which do not take risk (e.g. do not accept capitated payments in exchange for services) are not transacting the business of insurance.  Presumably, provider networks which only accept fees for services delivered, or discounted fees for services, will not be required to obtain a license.  Further, the regulations expressly state that providers who accept risk from other licensed insurance carriers (so-called downstream risk) are exempted from the regulations scope.  However, such providers must file a certificate to that effect with the Insurance Commissioner.

<H4>Application for a License</H4>
After final regulations are issued, provider networks that fall within the scope of  the regulations may apply for a license.  Application for a license requires a provider network to submit information regarding its proposed business plan, its corporate organizational documents,  an audit of its current financial conditions, and copies of its proposed contracts with providers and purchasers of  health care services.  The provider network must also submit information regarding the measures and protections it intends to take to ensure its fiscal solvency.  In conjunction with this requirement, the provider network must maintain a minimum net worth, excluding intangible assets, in an amount of no less than $100,000, unless the Insurance Commissioner requires a greater amount.<P>

In addition to the net worth requirements, the proposed regulations also require that an LSLPN post a deposit in the amount of $100,000, unless the Commissioner requires a greater amount, to protect against insolvency.  The provider network must also demonstrate its ability to monitor and evaluate the cost effectiveness of services delivered, and access to care provided.

<H4>Future Developments</H4>
The Division had projected July 1 as the effective date for the regulations.  However, as of the date of this publication, it has yet to issue revised regulations.  While the Division may issue final regulations within the next few months, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is also expected to issue model regulations on the same topic soon.  The Division may or may not postpone its regulatory process to track the NAICs efforts.  In any case, providers and their legal counsel should carefully monitor activities in this area, consistent with each networks individual business plan, as the Divisions regulatory process and the NAICs drafting efforts proceed.

<H2>FTC Considers Standards for
Using "Made In USA" Label</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>John M. Haurykiewicz and Matt Luxton</h4>
<p>


<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he proper use of the "Made in USA" and "Made in America" labels on products sold in the United States has generated a lot of activity recently.  Beginning with the prosecution of two athletic shoe manufacturers in 1994, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) set out a standard requiring that all or virtually all of a products parts and labor be of domestic origin when using one of these labels.  Subsequently this standard has come under fire from manufacturers, while receiving support from individual consumers, and the FTC has suspended enforcement, held a public hearing (which lasted two days), and published the comments from the hearing.  Unfortunately for those seeking more certain guidance, no new or restated standard has yet been published by the FTC.<p>

<strong>Background</strong><br>

Labeling requirements for products sold in commerce are thoroughly regulated under federal law.  In general, the laws of the United States Customs Service require that "every article of foreign origin" imported into this country be properly marked to indicate its place of origin.  These labeling requirements extend to component parts that are imported by manufacturers and assembled here into finished products unless the components are substantially transformed during manufacture.  Substantial transformation requires a fundamental change in form, appearance, nature, or character of a component which adds value to the finished product.<P>

For many years, federal law was silent on the specific use of the label "Made in America."  This changed in 1994 when Congress passed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which added § 45a to title 15 of the United States Code.  Section 45a specifically charges the FTC with monitoring the use of the Made in America (or its equivalent) label on goods.  The FTC was given the power to set a standard for using these labels that considered an appropriate percentage of imported components which may be included in the product.  Thus was added another arrow in the quiver of broad powers of the FTC to police and punish unfair competition and practices domestically, including improperly labeling products.<P>

It rapidly became apparent, however, that the FTC would not consider the percentage of foreign components and labor in enforcing § 45a.  In complaints brought against two athletic shoe manufacturers in 1994, the FTC set forth an "all or virtually all" standard for using the Made in America label.  Specifically, the FTC prosecuted Hyde Athletic Industries (manufacturer of Saucony running shoes) and New Balance Athletic Shoe for using variations of the Made in America label on shoes that were not wholly made in the United States.  The FTC felt that the shoe manufacturers had represented that all or virtually all, of the component parts of the athletic shoes [were] made in the United States, and that all or virtually all, of the labor in assembling the athletic shoes [was] performed in the United States, while most of the shoes were actually assembled abroad, or assembled domestically from foreign components.<P>

The FTCs "all or virtually all" standard prompted a swift and widespread response from manufacturers, who argued that this standard was impossible to meet and unrealistic in todays global economy.  Acknowledging the groundswell reaction, the FTC suspended its enforcement activities, and announced plans to conduct a comprehensive review of consumers perceptions of Made in America claims in product advertising and labeling.  Furthermore, the FTC stated it would promulgate a new standard for using such labels and issue guidelines on how domestic content was to be measured.  Toward this end, the FTC invited public comment on consumer perceptions of Made in America labels, and what standard should be used to measure domestic content in products.  For discussion purposes the FTC proposed a standard based on a percentage of domestic content as calculated by the sum of the purchase cost of domestic parts and the cost of labor and overhead in assembly divided by the total product cost.<P>

In the interim, the FTC carved out various "safe harbor provisions" for manufacturers of products having foreign components or labor.  In the Hyde decision, the FTC suggested the following as acceptable labeling for such products:
<OL type="A,B,C">
<LI>Made (or assembled) in X (country) of Y (country) components; or
<LI>Made (or assembled) in X (country) of domestic and foreign components; or
<LI>Made (or assembled) in X (country) of primarily (or mostly) foreign and some domestic components; or
<LI>Made (or assembled) in X (country) of primarily (or mostly) domestic and some foreign components; or
<LI>Made (or assembled) in X (country) of foreign components; or
<LI>Built in X (country) of imported components.
</OL>

No guidance was given as to what constitutes "primarily," "mostly," or "some" foreign or domestic parts.<P>

<strong>The Public Response</strong><br>

The period for public comment closed on January 22, 1996.  The FTC received 258 responses to its request, all of which can be reviewed on the FTCs World Wide Web page:  http://www.ftc.gov/opp/usa.htm.  Comments came from a variety of parties, including 164 responses from individuals and 94 responses from "professionals" including manufacturers, manufacturing associations, trade associations, labor unions, congresspersons, state Attorneys General, and government agencies.<P>

The responses by individuals almost uniformly called for strict adherence to the FTCs current standard.  While a few individuals recognized the difficulty of requiring 100% domestic content and proposed allowing use of the labels on products which are merely assembled domestically, most of the individuals urged retention of the current FTC standard, stating that anything less amounts to public deception.  Many expressed a concern for U.S. jobs, arguing that reducing the current standard will allow and encourage manufacturers to move a greater part of the manufacturing process overseas.  Individuals were generally outspoken in their advocacy, with one individual being careful to preface his comments by asking the FTC not to be offended by his letter, but then ending by suggesting that FTC employees "[g]et a real job and do something worthwhile, maybe cleaning toilets in the White House."<P>

Three responses were from labor unions.  Two unions, the International Leather Goods Union and the Teamsters Union, supported the current FTC standard.  The United Auto Workers, however, in a very thoughtful response, recognized that an "all or virtually all" standard, while desirable, is not practical in todays global economy.  The union urged the adoption of a standard that would ensure the greatest amount of domestic content possible, but did not articulate what that standard might be.  It expressly stated, however, that harmonization of the FTC standard with the Customs labeling requirements, as many in industry have called for (see below), would be inadequate to maximize domestic content.<P>

There were also responses from labeling and trade associations.  These associations were divided on what standard should be applied to the "Made in USA" label.  One association advocated abolishing the use of the "Made in USA" label, stating it is protectionist in nature.  Three associations advocated reducing the current FTC standard, but each proposed a different standard: a straight 75% domestic content standard, harmonizing the FTC standard with the labeling requirements of the Customs Service, and a "flexible standard" without a percentage of domestic content.  Three other associations supported the current standard.  Similar to the individual responses, these associations were outspoken in their advocacy - the Union Label and Service Trades Department equated any modification to the "all or virtually all" standard to the "NewSpeak" destruction of words in George Orwells novel, 1984.<P>

Another group of responses represented industry views, and included responses from individual manufacturers, manufacturing associations, and legislators.  Almost all of these industry responses expressed frustration over the multitude of country of origin and labeling laws, and the inconsistent requirements under these laws.  Sixteen of the 94 industry responses (which represent 6% of all responses, and 17% of industry responses) offered a straight percentage type standard, with 50% and 75% being the two most commonly proposed percentages.  Twenty three of the 94 industry responses (9% of all responses, 24% of industry responses) called for the harmonization of the FTC standard for "Made in USA" labels with the U.S. Customs country-of-origin laws, and advocated the adoption of the customs "substantial transformation" test by the FTC.  The U.S. Customs Service and the General Services Administration also submitted comments that support the adoption of the Customs Services standards.<P>

There were two notable exceptions, however, to the general industry desire to change the current FTC standard.  Both the textile / apparel industry and the hand tool industry voiced strong opposition to any alteration of the current FTC standard.  The textile industry responses were almost unanimous in support of the current standard, and advocated that current labeling requirements for textiles and apparel are sufficient.  Members of the small hand tool industry similarly urged the retention of the current FTC standards, indicating they use American steel in their manufacturing process, and want to retain their marketing advantage over other tool manufacturers who use imported steel and cannot currently use the "Made in USA" label.<P>

Legislative responses included seven comments from Congresspersons and individual and group comments from state Attorneys General representing 18 states.  The Congresspersons generally felt that the current "all or virtually all" standard was too stringent and penalized manufacturers who attempt to produce articles in the United States.  The Attorneys General, however, advocated retaining the current standard, although they felt a 90% domestic content standard would also be acceptable.  The Attorneys General further proposed adopting an "Assembled in USA" label for products containing a "significant" percentage of domestic labor.<P>

As a general conclusion, the responding parties advocated standards that further their individual interests.  Industry generally favored a reduction in the FTC standard because of difficulties in obtaining 100% of subcomponents from domestic sources, with a 50% or 75% domestic content threshold, or a harmonization of the FTC standard with the Customs Services "substantial transformation" test being advocated.  Individual parties and certain labor unions, on the other hand, urged the FTC to retain its current "all or virtually all" standard.  These parties asserted a fear that American jobs will be lost if a reduced standard is adopted.<P>

<strong>The Workshop</strong><br>

The FTC held a workshop to consider the public comments on March 26 and 27 of this year.  A number of the parties who submitted public comments participated in this workshop, including representatives from labor unions, trade associations, the Attorneys General from individual states, and the U.S. Customs Service.  The voluminous transcripts from the workshop are available for review on the FTC Web page.<P>

Participants in the workshop discussed the FTCs current standard regarding the use of "Made in USA" labels and proposed alternatives to this standard.  While much of the discussion was a restatement of the public comments described above, three primary areas of discussion were the use of the "all or virtually all" standard, a percentage standard, and a "substantial transformation" standard.  Significant questions were raised regarding the exact application of any of these three standards, including how far back in the manufacturing process "content" is measured, what content should be measured, and definitions of terms such as "all or virtually all" and "substantial."  The workshop ended without any clear consensus on the appropriate standard for using "Made in the USA" labels.<P>

The FTC has again invited public comment on the use of the "Made in USA" labels in response to the issues raised at the workshop.  Specifically, the FTC has requested comments on the workshop transcript itself, and on questions raised in the workshop such as when content should be measured, what content should be measured, and what "substantial transformation" test should be utilized.  While originally set to close on April 30th, the FTC extended the time for these comments to June 30, 1996 due to the complexity of the issues.  The FTC has not yet published any of these new comments, but is expected to do so on their Web page when it has processed the comments.<P>

<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>

The standard for the use of "Made in America" or its equivalent in marking or marketing products is currently uncertain.  While the FTC recently required any product using such a label to be entirely comprised of domestic components and labor, they are currently considering revising this standard to take into account consumer perceptions regarding "Made in America" labels.  Interested parties have proposed a number of standards, ranging from retaining the current "all or virtually all" standard to harmonizing the FTCs marking requirements with those of the Customs Service.  As the recent workshop on this issue made clear, however, no consensus has been reached, or is likely to be reached in the near future on a single standard.  In the interim, manufacturers may choose to use the "safe harbor" provisions set forth by the FTC in marking and marketing their products in order to avoid running afoul of whatever standard is eventually adopted.

<H2>Bad Faith Patent Infringement and Increased Damages: The Federal Circuit Speaks</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Jeff H. Eckland 
and William L. Roberts</h4>
<p>


<FONT SIZE=+2>U</FONT>nder patent law, a court may award up to three times the patent owners actual damages based on a finding that the defendants infringement was willful.   The Federal Circuit has long held, however, that a finding of willful infringement, whether by a court or a jury, permits but does not compel an  increased damages award.  As a result, even where a patent holder wins a willfulness verdict at trial, the trial judge has broad discretion in deciding whether and to what extent to award increased damages.<P>

But where a trial court requires the jury to make a factual finding that the infringement was done in bad faith in order to reach a verdict of willfulness, does that bad faith finding bind the trial court in deciding the issue of increased damages?  In Jurgens v. CBK, LTD., 80 F. 3d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1996), in which Jeff H. Eckland argued for plaintiffs to the Federal Circuit, and was accompanied on the briefs by William L. Roberts and R. Carl Moy, the Federal Circuit answered this question in the affirmative.  <P>

In the process, the Federal Circuit expounded on the distinct but oft-confused concepts of willful infringement and reaffirmed the impact of a jury verdict on the trial courts discretion to award increased damages. The Jurgens case thus counterbalances the recent trend toward erosion of the right to jury trial in patent cases.  See, e.g., Markman v. Westview Instruments., Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 989 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Mayer, J., concurring in judgment only) (this [the majoritys holding] is not just about claim language, it is about ejecting juries from infringement cases).<P>

<strong>The Opinion</strong><br>

The Jurgens case was tried in the Western District of Tennessee.  The Jurgenses claimed that CBK, LTD., a gift market wholesaler, had copied their patented windsock bird decoy products and sold them by the thousands throughout the United States.  The Jurgenses obtained summary judgment in their favor on patent validity and infringement.  The issues of compensatory damages and willfulness were tried to a jury.<P>

The jury returned a verdict in the Jurgenses favor, finding about $550,000 in compensatory damages and finding that the defendants infringement was willful as the trial court had defined that term in the jury charge.  Over plaintiffs objection, the trial court had defined willful infringement to require a finding of bad faith conduct on the part of the defendants.  Thus, in finding willfulness the jury necessarily found that the defendants had acted in bad faith.<P>

Despite the jury verdict, the trial court refused to award any increased damages.  The trial court concluded that the defendants infringement was the result of reliance upon the opinion of counsel and thus did not warrant the punishment of increased damages.
The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded.  As a threshold matter, the Court noted that a finding of bad faith is not required for a finding of willful infringement.    Bad faith, noted the Federal Circuit, has numerous patent law applications.  80 F.3d at 1570.  As it relates to predicate culpability for an increased damages award, bad faith infringement denotes merely one type of infringement.  Id. at 1571.  Bad faith infringement occurs, for example, where an infringer obtains an incompetent, conclusory opinion of counsel only to use as a shield against a later charge of willful infringement  exactly what the Jurgenses contended occurred in this case.  <P>
Deliberate copying of a patented invention with no validity or infringement inquiry at all is another example of bad faith infringement, according to the Federal Circuit.  Id.  <P>

Thus, held the Federal Circuit, the trial judge raised the hurdle for a willfulness verdict above the minimum legal threshold by requiring the jury to find bad faith.  In effect, the trial court  made the rejection of the defendants contention that they acted in good faith reliance on opinion of counsel a necessary prerequisite to a verdict of willfulness.  Considering the detailed jury instruction, which included ... an additional requirement that CBK act in bad faith, the only way the jury could have reached the decision that CBKs conduct was willful was to reject its contention that it relied in good faith on the opinion of counsel.  Id. at 1572.<P>

Once the trial court submitted the issue of bad faith to the jury and found the evidence sufficient to support the jurys verdict, the Federal Circuit held that the trial court could neither disregard the jurys bad faith finding nor make contrary findings in deciding the issue of enhanced damages.  Said the Federal Circuit, Although a trial court many times has the discretion to weigh the closeness of the case and the scope of the infringers investigation in deciding whether to increase a damages award, it does not have discretion to reweigh this evidence once the matter has been decided by the jury...  Id.  Because the trial courts refusal to award increased damages was based on a conclusion that contradicted the jurys bad faith finding, the Federal Circuit remanded the case for reconsideration with due regard for the jurys  factual findings.<P>

<strong>Analysis</strong><br>

The Federal Circuits opinion in Jurgens v. CBK, LTD.  marks the first time the Court has directly addressed the interplay between the concepts of willful infringement, bad faith infringement, and enhanced damages.  How is it that an infringer can be guilty of willful infringement warranting increased damages without having acted in bad faith?  The answer lies in the concept of willful infringement as it has developed under Federal Circuit case law.<P>

The patent law, according to the Federal Circuit, imposes an affirmative duty  on every party who engages in any potentially infringing conduct to use due care to avoid infringing anothers patent rights.  It follows that a party can be held to have willfully infringed a patent even in the absence of malice or bad faith conduct.  A party may be liable for increased damages simply because the party did not fulfill its affirmative duty of due care, i.e., did not do enough to investigate the propriety of its conduct, before it forged ahead.  For example, a party who proceeds with sales of a product sincerely believing that its conduct does not infringe is nevertheless vulnerable to a finding of willful infringement if the party fails to consult with a qualified attorney on the issue.  In such a case, there is no bad faith conduct.  There is merely a failure to take certain steps which the patent law in most cases demands as protection for the rights of patent holders.  The infringement is willful but not in bad faith.<P>

The question the trial court typically must address in deciding whether and how much to increase damages is, where on this spectrum of culpability does the defendants conduct lie?  The accepted meaning of the term bad faith and the specific examples of bad faith infringement the Federal Circuit articulated in the Jurgens opinion make clear that bad faith infringement lies at the upper end of this spectrum as the most egregious form of infringement.  Deliberate copying with no inquiry whatsoever evinces a callous disregard for the patent law which has often formed the basis for the maximum punishment available   treble damages.  And the use of a faulty attorney opinion as a mere protective device is perhaps the most egregious, form of infringement possible.  Not only does it reflect a callous disregard for the patent law, but it also demonstrates a premeditated effort to conceal such improper behavior.  It would appear such conduct similarly warrants an award of treble damages against the infringer.<P>The Jurgens opinion thus clarifies that a party may in certain circumstances be liable for willful infringement without having acted in bad faith.  A party who has infringed a patent in bad faith, on the other hand, has a culpability which exceeds the minimum threshold necessary for an award of increased damages and is a prime candidate for a judgment of treble damages.<P>

Significantly, the Jurgens opinion also strongly reaffirms the principal that jury fact findings are binding on a trial court in addressing the  issue of increased damages.  Although the principal was implicit in prior Federal Circuit cases, the Federal Circuit had never before expressly held that the trial court is bound by a jurys fact findings supporting a verdict of willfulness.  Indeed, the dissenter in Jurgens argued that Federal Circuit precedent rejected exactly this principal.  80 F.3d at 1575.  At a minimum, the Jurgens case ensures that a jury trial on the issues of willfulness will not devolve into a pointless exercise whose outcome the trial judge is free to ignore.<P>

<H2>Eurasian Patent Convention</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Iliana Haleen</h4>
<p>


<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n the last few years, laws in the former USSR and Eastern European countries relating to intellectual property rights have been modernized to conform with comparable legislation in Western Europe.  The recently adopted Eurasian Patent Convention is an example.  It largely corresponds to the European Patent Convention and is expected to function the same way.<P>

Patent applications may now be filed with the newly established Eurasian Patent Office in Moscow. The Eurasian Patent Office may also be designated in PCT applications.<P>

At present, the Eurasian Patent Convention has the following members:

<blockquote>
Russian Federation<BR>
Belarus<BR>
Azerbaijan<BR>
Kazakhstan<BR>
Kyrgyzstan<BR>
Tadzhikistan<BR>
Turkmenistan
</blockquote>

The Convention will also enter into force in Moldova on February 16, 1996 and in Armenia on February 27, 1996. Ukraine and Georgia signed the Convention, but have not yet ratified it at this writing.  Uzbekistan and the Baltic StatesLithuania, Latvia and Estoniahave not yet joined the Convention.<p>

The Eurasian Patent Convention establishes common criteria for patentability.  Eurasian patents are granted for inventions that are new, involve an inventive step and have an industrial application. The duration of patent protection is 20 years.  The Convention also contains provisions concerning persons entitled to apply for an Eurasian patent, the rights of the patent owner, and circumstances under which compulsory licenses must be granted.  Convention member states do retain their sovereignty as to their national patent systems. Consequently, much of the Eurasian patent protection is covered by national law and not by the Conventions provisions.  Some other key provisions are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>The application and the Eurasian patent extend to all States that are members of the Convention as of the filing date.  
<LI>The application will be published after 18 months from the first priority date. Requests for examination must be filed and an examination fee paid within 6 months from the date of publication of the application.
<LI>One or more priorities may be claimed.
<LI>Generally, the examination procedure corresponds substantially to Russian patent practice; extensions of term are usually possible upon payment of an additional fee.
<LI>The application documents of a Eurasian patent application may be filed in a language other than Russian, but a subsequent filing of a Russian translation thereof is necessary.
<LI>After granting a patent, annual patent fees shall be paid for each designated state through the Eurasian Patent Office. The fees for each state are determined by that state.
<LI>Within six months after publication of the registration of a Eurasian patent in the Bulletin of the Eurasian Patent Office, an opposition can be filed which, if successful, can result in the patent being restricted or annulled.
<LI>Nullity, infringement, compulsory license and the like remain reserved to the national legislation of the member states.  National courts also may decide on such matters, but only for validity within their respective territories.
</UL>

The Eurasian Patent Convention is designed to facilitate international patent protection over the greater part of the former USSR in conformity with the provisions of the European Patent Convention.  The final list of members of the Convention and the role the Convention will ultimately play in the international scheme of protection for intellectual property rights remain to be seen.

<H2>Gronholz v. Sears, Roebuck & Co: <BR> 
A Lesson in Patent Trial Strategy</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Jeff H. Eckland and William L. Roberts</h4>
<p>


<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n the recent jury trial of Marlene Gronholz v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Ryobi Motor Products Corp., Civil File No. 3-94-1239 (U.S. District Court, D. Minnesota, Hon. Michael J. Davis, presiding) Jeff H. Eckland and William L. Roberts of Faegre & Benson LLP successfully represented Sears and its manufacturer, Ryobi, against a claim of patent infringement potentially worth $3,000,000.00.  The jury awarded no damages and found that defendants did not infringe the patent.  The case provides a good illustration of a key aspect of patent trial strategy: utilizing one central winning theme.  <P>

Patent cases present a myriad of potential legal and factual issues.  Patent validity alone potentially raises issues of prior public use, anticipation, obviousness, inequitable conduct, and others.  Interpretation of the patent claims and comparison of the claims to the accused device typically present as many, if not more, potential issues.  And a decision in favor of the accused infringer on any one of these issues is generally fatal to the patent holders claim.<P>

Thus, parties accused of patent infringement have no shortage of potential defenses.  Indeed, the most difficult aspect of defending a patent case often is not developing defenses but instead making the strategic decisions about what arguments not to make.  The natural desire to preserve every available issue combined with uncertainty about which arguments a factfinder might find credible creates a strong temptation to use a shotgun approach, putting forth every plausible defense in the hopes that one will take hold.
Parties and their counsel must resist this temptation.  Particularly in a jury trial, the failure to drop weaker defenses in order to shape the case around one central theme can be costly.  A carefully tailored presentation of a single, consistent theme magnifies the persuasiveness of the defense.  The shotgun approach, by contrast, tends to reduce persuasiveness.  The presentation of weak arguments can distract the fact finder from the strong ones and, worse, can lead to a loss in overall credibility.  A confused, bewildered jury is unlikely to invalidate a patent which has received the seal of approval from the PTO.  Such a jury is still less likely to find noninfringement based on fine distinctions between the patent claim and the accused device.  In short, less is more when it comes to framing trial defenses in patent cases.<P>

In Gronholz, the plaintiff was the widow of deceased inventor Donald Gronholz.  Mr. Gronholz invented a device called a router guide.  He showed his invention to a Sears representative.  Sears evaluated a prototype of the device, but entered into no agreement with Mr. Gronholz.  After the Gronholz patent issued, Sears came into the market with a new Craftsman router guide.  Mr. Gronholz sued Sears and its router guide manufacturer claiming they had willfully infringed his patent.<P>

In large part because of a tortured procedural history both in the PTO and in federal court, the facts presented a multitude of potential defenses.  The challenge was to develop a defense theme that would overcome the inevitable first impression that Sears had copied and exploited Gronholzs invention without paying him a dime.<P>

A frontal assault on the patents validity was a definite possibility.  Given the prior art, one could reasonably argue that the patent should never have been issued, that the Gronholz device contributed nothing new and useful to the art of router guide design.
Such a frontal assault, however, faced two difficulties.  First, the PTO had issued the patent and had also upheld it upon reexamination.  Obviously, the examiner felt the Gronholz device disclosed something new and useful.  To win on this theory, the jury would have to conclude that the patent office was wrong.<P>

Second, the argument tended to undercut Sears defense of noninfringement.  The Sears device did look similar to the Gronholz router guide.  Indeed, plaintiffs theory of the case was that Sears copied the Gronholz device and simply omitted one thumb screw to try to avoid liability.  Sears noninfringement defense was this:  Sears and its manufacturer studied the Gronholz device, the Gronholz patent, and the prior art to determine what the unique features of the Gronholz patent were.  The manufacturer, with the advice of counsel, proceeded to design a product that did not contain the features which made the Gronholz device unique and hence patentable.  Sears used in its new router guide only what was known from the prior art and refrained from using the patentable features of the Gronholz device.  <P>

If in fact thats the way Sears and its manufacturer proceeded, then in the jurys mind there would be no good reason for Sears to attack the patents validity.  If Sears argued invalidity over the prior art, it would risk inadvertently communicating to the jury that Sears did not believe its own noninfringement argument.  Worse, Sears would be arguing against itself in saying on one hand that the patent discloses nothing new, but on the other hand that Sears carefully avoided copying the new features of the Gronholz device.  <P>

Sears did not argue the prior art invalidity defense at trial.  It presented the noninfringement defense as its one central theme.  Sears supplemented this theme with a consistent argument that the key patent claim was invalid not because of the prior art but because plaintiff had attempted to broaden the patent upon reissue to try to bring the Craftsman router guide within its scope.  Sears won.
The jury in its special verdict found that the Sears device did not infringe the patent literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.  The jury also found that the key claim of the patent was invalid because it was broadened upon reissue.  In light of its noninfringement finding, the jury found that plaintiff was entitled to no damages and did not reach the question of willfulness.<P>

Had Sears taken the tack of asserting all possible defenses, the outcome may well have been different.  But the ability to discard less persuasive theories and focus on one central winning theme enabled Sears to prevail over a sympathetic plaintiff with a claim which, on the surface, was quite appealing.<P>

<H2>Minnesota Narrows  Insurance Coverage for
Patent Infringement Claim</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>William L. Roberts</h4>
<p>


<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n a case of first impression for a Minnesota appellate court, the Minnesota Court of Appeals recently held that a commercial general liability insurer is not obligated to defend or indemnify against a claim of patent infringement.  In Fluoroware, Inc. v. Chubb Group of Ins. Cos., 545 N.W. 2d 678 (1996), Fluoroware faced a suit for patent infringement based on its sales of plastic disk packages.  Fluoroware tendered the defense to its  commercial general liability (CGL) insurers, the Chubb Group and others, who denied coverage and refused to defend.  Fluoroware filed a declaratory judgment action to establish coverage.<p>

The district court, relying on the leading Minnesota federal district court case John Deere Ins. Co. v. Shamrock Indus., 696 F. Supp. 434 (D. Minn. 1988), affd , 929 F.2d 413 (8th Cir. 1991), found the claim to be covered.  Since the allegedly infringing device had been the subject of Fluoroware advertising, the district court concluded the infringement claim fell within the advertising injury clause of the CGL policy.  Consistent with John Deere, the lower court rejected the argument that, to be covered, the claimed injury must have been proximately caused by the advertising activity.  545 N.W.2d at 681.<p>

The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that under Minnesota law a showing of direct causation between the advertising activity and the claimed injury must be made:  [A]dvertising liability coverage does not result inevitably from infringement claims merely because a product is advertised.  Id. at 681.  Further, in order to obtain coverage, the Court of Appeals held that the insured must show that the underlying claim arguably constitutes an offense specifically listed in the policy.  The Court of Appeals proceeded to reject Fluorwares contentions that a patent infringement claim falls within the scope of misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business, unfair competition, or piracy, all of which were specifically listed torts under the advertising injury CGL policy provisions at issue.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held, the CGL policy imposed no obligation on the insurers to defend or indemnify against the claim.<p>

In so holding, the Minnesota Court of Appeals joins a growing line of authorities holding that a claim of patent infringement does not fall within the scope of the standard CGL policys coverage.  See, e.g., Intex Plastic Sales Co. v. United Natl Ins. Co., 23 F.3d 254 (9th Cir. 1994); Bank of the West v. Superior Court, 833 P.2d 545 (Cal. 1992).  Indeed, commentators have criticized the few earlier opinions reflecting a contrary view.  See W. Savino and C. Butera, Insurance Coverage and Patent Infringement:  Beyond Insureds Reasonable Expectations, 661 PLI/Comm 103 (1993).<p>

Significantly, the Fluoroware case was before the Court of Appeals on a certified question addressing only the claim of direct patent infringement.  In its brief statement of facts, the Court of Appeals noted that Fluoroware was also accused of contributory infringement and actively inducing infringement.  However, the Court of Appeals chose not to address the issue whether a claim of contributory patent infringement or active inducement of patent infringement falls within the scope of CGL policy coverage.  A claim that an insureds advertising teaches or encourages consumers to engage in an act constituting patent infringement (a type of contributory patent infringement) appears to contain the direct causal connection between the advertising activity and the claimed injury which the Court of Appeals found essential.  Moreover, such a claim may arguably constitute a form of unfair competition.  Thus, it remains an open question in Minnesota whether coverage exists under the standard CGL policy for contributory and inducement-type patent infringement claims.

<TITLE>Recent patent law developments</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
1994 was a year of significant change for the United States Patent Law.  The GATT implementation legislation, with its provision of 20-year patent terms and provisional applications, is probably the most fundamental change made to the law since its enactment.  On the judicial front, the Federal Circuit continued its efforts to refine the law on such important topics as the doctrine of equivalents and mathematical algorithms implemented by computer.  Highlights of these and other recent developments follow.  Patent practitioners and owners alike will want to carefully consider the effects these developments.<P>
Patent law was also significantly impacted in 1994 when Congress and President Clinton enacted the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.  The Act changes the enforceable life of a patent, permits the filing of a "provisional" application which permits applicants to preserve patent rights while deferring commencement of the patent term, allows the life of a patent to be extended under certain circumstances which cause a delay in issuance of the patent, and includes an offer to sell a patented invention to the list of infringing activities.<P>
</DL>
<H2>CAFC CASES</H2>
<DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>Means-Plus-Function Claims are to be Construed According 35 USC § 112, Sixth Paragraph, for Patentability as Well as Infringement Determinations</B><P>
<B><EM>In re Donaldson Co.</EM>, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The sixth paragraph of 35 USC § 112 states that a means-plus-function claim shall be construed to cover corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.  However, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) refused to apply this paragraph during examination, and instead more broadly construed means expressions according to their literal language.  As a result, the PTO took the position that a claimed "means" element was anticipated by any structure capable of performing the recited function.<P>
The Federal Circuit, in an en banc decision, forced the PTO to narrow its interpretation of means claims during prosecution to cover only the structure, material, or acts described in the specification, and equivalents thereof.  Means claims must be construed in accordance with paragraph six during patentability determinations by the PTO, as well as during validity and infringement determinations by a court.<P>
<DT><B>Programmed Computers may be Patentable Subject Matter Under 35 USC § 101</B><P>
<B><EM>In re Alappat</EM>, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The majority of an en banc panel of the Federal Circuit held that a claim to a rasterizer for converting waveform sample data into pixel illumination intensity data for subsequent display (e.g., by an oscilloscope), and written in means-plus-function language, is directed to a "machine" which is patentable subject matter under 35 USC § 101.  The decision is based heavily upon the law established only months earlier in In re Donaldson that means-plus-function claims must be interpreted for purposes of patentability as covering at least the structure disclosed in the application corresponding to the claimed "means."  Since Alappat's application disclosed known circuit elements such as a barrel shifter and an arithmetic logic unit for performing these functions, the claim was found to characterize a patentable machine.<P>
Although the embodiment of the invention described in the application was not implemented by a computer, the decision supports the proposition that a general purpose computer programmed to perform the recited functions would also be patentable.  The court states that such programming creates a new machine, because a general purpose computer in effect becomes a special purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to software instructions.<P>
Perhaps the most important aspect of this decision is its discussion of the "mathematical algorithm exception" to § 101.  Under the two-part Freeman-Walter-Abele test developed prior to this decision and used to identify unpatentable algorithms, the claim is first analyzed to determine whether it directly or indirectly recites a mathematical algorithm.  Once a mathematical algorithm is found, the claim as a whole is further analyzed to determine whether the algorithm is applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps.  If so applied, the claim passes muster under § 101.  In practice, both parts of this test are difficult to consistently apply to the ever expanding range of computer-implemented inventions.<P>
The majority in Alappat never applied the Freeman-Walter-Abele test.  Instead, they state that the claim at issue meets the appropriate test, which is "whether the claimed subject matter as a whole is a disembodied mathematical concept, whether categorized as a mathematical formula, mathematical equation, mathematical algorithm, or the like, which in essence represents nothing more than a 'law of nature,' 'natural phenomenon,' or abstract idea.'"  The use of this intuitive test could lead to more consistent and accurate determinations of computer-implemented inventions that are unpatentable algorithms.<P>
<DT><B><EM>In re Warmerdam</EM>, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1754 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The method claims at issue were directed to a method for generating a data structure which represents the shape of a physical object in a position and/or motion control machine as a hierarchy of bubbles.  Analyzing these claims using the Freeman-Walter-Abele test, the Federal Circuit concluded that they recited nothing more than the manipulation of abstract ideas and were therefore unpatentable subject matter.<P>
The apparatus claim at issue was directed to a machine having memory which contains data representing a bubble hierarchy generated by the method claims.  Without any analysis, the court stated that this claim is clearly patentable subject matter.<P>
<DT><B><EM>In re Karen I. Trovato and Leendert Dorst</EM>, Civ. File No. 93-1050,-1565, (Fed. Cir. December 19, 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The inventions were the product of work in the field of computer science known as graph theory.  At issue were method and means-plus-function apparatus claims for propagating cost waves through a data structure representing a physical task space, to determine the least cost path of motion through the task space.  Using the Freeman-Walter-Abele test, the Federal Circuit concluded that both the apparatus and method claims recited nothing more than the manipulation of abstract ideas and were therefore unpatentable subject matter.<P>
<DT><B>Disclosure of an Invention to One or More Friends or Colleagues Prior to Critical Date Results in Loss of Patent Rights</B><P>
<B><EM>The National Research Dev. Corp. v. Varian Assoc. Inc.</EM>, 30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1537 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The patented invention at issue in this case was a method and apparatus for eliminating noise produced by an NMR spectrometer.  More than one year before the patent applications filing date (the critical date), the inventor's graduate-studies advisor discussed the invention with another scientist during a one-on-one conversation at a convention.  The scientist receiving the information was not asked to keep the information confidential.  The Federal Circuit held that this disclosure placed the invention in public use under 35 USC § 102(b) and, therefore, invalidated the patent.<P>
<DT><B><EM>The Beachcombers, Int'l Inc. v. WildeWood Creative Prod. Inc.</EM>, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1653 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>A subsequently patented kaleidoscope was shown to party guests by the inventor more than one year before the patent application was filed.  The guests were not asked to maintain in secrecy any information about the device.  The Federal Circuit found that this activity placed the invention in public use under 35 USC § 102(b) and, therefore, invalidated the patent.<P>
<DT><B>Invention Disclosures in Continuation Patent Applications Need Not Be Updated to Comply with the Best Mode Requirement</B><P>
<B><EM>Transco Prod. Inc. v. Performance Contracting</EM>, 32 U.S.P.Q.2d 1077 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The patent involved in this case issued from a continuation application.  Although the best mode for practicing the invention changed between the original filing date and the filing date of the continuation application, the description of the invention was not updated in the continuation application.  The district court held the patent invalid for failure to comply with the best mode requirement of 35 USC § 112 when the continuation application was filed.<P>
The Federal Circuit overruled the lower court decision, stating that there is no need to update the invention disclosure to comply with the best mode requirement when filing a continuation application.  To the extent that the continuation application is claiming only subject matter disclosed in the original application, the key date for purposes of the best mode requirement is the date of the original application.<P>
<DT><B>U.S. Courts Lack Jurisdiction to Consider Infringement of Foreign Patents</B><P>
<B><EM>Mars Inc. v. Kabushiki-Kaisha Nippon Conlux</EM>, 30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1621 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The holder of U.S. and Japanese patents to an invention sued its competitor in the United States for infringement of both the U.S. and Japanese patents.  The Federal Circuit held that U.S. courts do not have power to consider the claim of infringement of the Japanese patent since the infringement claims are not so related that they form part of the same case or controversy, and governing laws are different.<P>
<DT><B>References Pertaining to Different Fields of Endeavor Can be Analogous Prior Art if Pertinent to Problem Being Solved</B><P>
<B><EM>Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG v. Hantscho Commercial Prod. Inc.</EM>, 30 U.S.P.Q.2d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>One of the issues presented in this case was whether a reference showing a mechanism for converting between reciprocating and rotary motion in machines such as engines could be used to assert the obviousness of a similar mechanism in a chopper for folding sheets emerging from a printing press.  Although overturning the district court's determination of obviousness on the basis of significant evidence of commercial success and the lack of a suggestion in the prior art to combine the references, the Federal Circuit provided guidance on when references can be considered analogous prior art.  In particular, the court states that references that are not within the field of the inventor's endeavor can be relied on in patentability determinations, and are therefore described as "analogous art", when a person of ordinary skill in the art would have reasonably consulted those references and applied their teachings when seeking a solution to the problem they were facing.<P>
<DT><B><EM>In re Paulsen</EM>, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1671 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>One of the issues addressed by the Federal Circuit in this case was whether references showing hinges and latch mechanisms used in a desktop telephone directory, piano lid and washing machine cabinet were analogous to such devices used to secure the display housing in a laptop computer.  Using the guidelines set forth in <EM>Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG v. Hantscho Commercial Products Inc.</EM>, the court determined that given the nature of the problem, one of ordinary skill in the art would have consulted these other mechanical arts and that the references were reasonably pertinent.  It therefore concluded that the Board's finding that the references were analogous was not clearly erroneous.<P>
<DT><B>Design Patent Obviousness Rejection Requires Primary Reference Having Basically the Same Design Characteristics as Claimed Design</B><P>
<B><EM>In re Harvey</EM>, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d 1206 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</B><P>
<DD>The design patent applications at issue were directed to vases formed by the intersection of two geometric solids.  Vases based on this concept, but with different geometric solids, were known.  Both the Patent Office and the Board rejected the applications as the obvious substitution of one common geometric solid for another.<P>
Reversing the Board's decision, the Federal Circuit states that a proper design patent rejection requires that the visual ornamental features of the claimed design appear in the prior art in a manner which suggests such features as used in the claimed design.  The primary cited reference must have design characteristics that are basically the same as the claimed design.  The designs of other references can then be relied upon for modification of the basic design.<P>
<DT><B>PTO Can Rely on Hearsay in Making Rejections During Examination</B><P>
<B><EM>In re Epstein</EM>, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The Federal Circuit ruled that the Board did not err in determining that third-party software products were "in public use and on sale" more than one year before the applicant's filing date, and were therefore properly considered prior art, based upon abstracts that are not themselves prior art publications but which indicate that products were "first installed" or "released" more than one year prior to filing date.  Although the abstracts were on their face hearsay, they appeared to be accurate and reliable.  The applicant's were free to introduce rebuttal evidence, but did not.<P>
<DT><B>Printed Matter Rejection Not Appropriate for Claim to Memory Data Structure</B><P>
<B><EM>In re Lowry</EM>, 32 U.S.P.Q.2d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</B><P>
<DD>The claims at issue in this case were directed to a memory having an original data structure.  The Board analogized the data structure to printed matter, and rejected the claims on the basis that the "printed matter" data structure was not functionally related to the memory.  The court reversed the Board's decision holding that the printed matter cases have no factual relevance in situations such as that presented by this case where the claimed invention requires that the information be processed by a computer rather than the mind.<P>
<DT><B>Efforts by Third Party to Obtain Documents Used In Alternative Dispute Resolution Rejected</B><P>
<B><EM>Haworth Inc. v. Steelcase Inc</EM>, 19 F.3d 39 (Fed. Cir. 1994)</B><P>
<DD>Haworth sued Steelcase and Herman Miller in separate actions alleging infringement of Haworth patents on electrified wall panel systems.  Haworth and Steelcase agreed to submit the case to a special master for resolution by settlement or mini-trial.  Herman Miller subpoenaed Steelcase for documents relating to the Haworth-Steelcase litigation and ADR proceedings and alternatively moved to intervene in the Haworth-Steelcase litigation.  The court balanced the competing interests of public access to court records with the privacy interests of Haworth and Steelcase and held against Herman Miller.  The court noted that the use of private ADR techniques should be encouraged.<P>
<DT><B>Generic Disclosure Does Not Necessarily Prevent Patenting of Specific Species Falling Within the Generic Disclosure Under 35 U.S.C. § 102.</B><P>
<B><EM>In Re Baird</EM>, 16 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1994)</B><P>
<DD>Generic disclosure of family of chemical compounds encompassing more than one hundred million individual compounds does not render a specific compound within that family obvious unless the generic disclosure suggests the specific compound.<P>
<DT><B>Patent Specification and Scope of Invention Examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office Defines "Function" of the Invention for Assessing Infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents.</B><P>
<B><EM>Genentech Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd</EM>, 29 F.3d 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1994)</B><P>
<DD>Genentech owns two patents covering the production of a protein known as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) by means of recombinant DNA techniques.  Wellcome manufactures two competing products met-t-PA and FE1X.  When applying the standard function-way-result tripartite test used to determine infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, the court notes that the specification of the Genentech patents define the "function" of the claimed t-PA as both "stimulating the dissolution of fibrin clots through the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin" and "catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and binding to fibrin."  The competing products met-t-PA and FE1X stimulate the dissolution of fibrin clots through the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin but do not bind to fibrin.  Hence, as the court notes, the ultimate conclusion as to whether the competing products met-t-PA and FE1X infringe under the doctrine of equivalents depends entirely upon the breadth of the "function" utilized in the test.  The court resolves the matter by establishing that the Patent Office must have issued the patent based upon the more limited "catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and binding to fibrin" function provided in the specification and correspondingly limiting the breadth of the "function" prong in the function-way-result test.<P>
<DT><B>Patent Owner's Ability to Recover Damages for Failure to Mark Under 35 U.S.C § 287 Can Result From Imputed Licensee's Failure to Mark.</B><P>
<B><EM>Amsted Industries v. Buckeye Steel</EM>, 23 F.3d 374 (Fed. Cir. 1994)</B><P>
<DD>Failure of implied licensee to mark patented products under 35 U.S.C § 287 is imputed to patent owner.  Failure to mark precludes the patent owner from recovering damages for infringement prior to the time the infringer was actually notified of such infringement.<P>
<DT><B>Court Refuses to Issue Injunction After Conclusion of Seventeen Year Despite Extensive Infringement of Patent During Patent Term.</B><P>
<B><EM>Kearns v. Chrysler</EM>, 32 F.3d 1541 (Fed. Cir. 1994)</B><P>
<DD>Owner of patent to intermittent windshield wipers is not entitled to injunctive relief after expiration of seventeen year patent term.  Plaintiff's novel argument that infringement of patent during seventeen year period deprived him of the ability to enjoy the rights granted by the patent for the full seventeen year period was rejected by the court.<P>

<H2>Legislation</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
The Uruguay Round Agreements Act was signed into law by President Clinton on December 8, 1994.  This piece of legislation implements the trade agreements concluded in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (GATT).  Significant and fundamental changes to the U.S. Patent Law are included in this Act.  The Patent and Trademark Office has also published proposed amendments to the rules of practice to implement the changes contained in the Act.  These amendments will be the subject of a public hearing on February 16, 1995.<P>
Introduced, but not passed by, the 103rd Congress was The Patent Application Publication Act of 1994.  This Act had provisions directed to the publication of patent applications after 18 months from the application's earliest effective filing date.  Similar legislation will likely be acted upon by the 104th Congress.  The Patent and Trademark Office will hold a public hearing on issues associated with the 18-month publication of patent applications on February 15, 1995.<P>
In general, the changes to the Patent Law brought about by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act will take effect one year after the date on which the WTO (World Trade Organization) Agreement is entered into force with respect to the United States.  Certain transitional procedures are effective on June 8, 1995, six months following the effective date of the Act.  The following are among the more significant changes to the Patent Law.<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>20 Year Patent Term</B><P>
<DD>All U.S. Patent applications filed on or after June 8, 1995 will be effective for a term beginning on the date of issuance and ending 20 years from the U.S. filing date.  If the application claims priority from any earlier filed U.S. parent application, the term ends 20 years from the filing date of the earliest such parent application.  Priority from an earlier filed foreign application under 35 USC § 119 is not take into account in determining the term of a patent.  The earliest U.S. filing date is the trigger for the term.<P>
Patents issued on or before June 8, 1995, and patents issuing on applications filed before that date, shall have a term which is the greater of the 20-year term as described above, or 17 years from the date of grant.  Acts that become infringing by reason of this transitional term option are not subject to the remedies of injunctive relief, damages or attorney fees if substantial investment was made prior to June 8, 1995.<P>
<DT><B>Provisional Application Filing Procedures</B><P>
<DD>A new "provisional application" filing procedure is established in § 111(b).  To obtain a filing date, a provisional application need only contain a specification in accordance with § 112 and a drawing as prescribed by § 113.  The name of the inventor(s) and the $150 filing fee ($75 for small businesses and individual inventors) can be filed later.  No claims or oath/declaration are required.  The application will not be examined, does not mature into a patent, and is not subject to interference proceedings.<P>
A provisional application is not entitled to a right of priority from any earlier-filed foreign or U.S. application, and is regarded as automatically abandoned 12 months after its filing date.<P>
A "regular" U.S. application filed under § 111(a) can claim priority from a provisional application.  The term of a patent issuing on such a § 111(a) application is determined by its filing date, not the filing date of the parent provisional application.  Provisional applications therefore enable U.S. applicants to establish a priority date while postponing by 1 year the filing event that triggers the 20-year patent term (as foreign applicants can by taking advantage of the Paris Convention priority year).  However, it is important to remember that the provisional application is a regular national filing that starts the Convention priority year.<P>
<DT><B>Patent Term Extensions</B><P>
<DD>Patent term extensions of up to 5 years are available for certain delays in the issuance of a patent.  Reasons that can be used to secure such an extension include the imposition of a secrecy order, an interference and successful appellate review before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences and federal courts.  The period of extension shall be reduced by any time attributable to appellate review before the expiration of 3 years from the application filing date, and for the period of time during which the applicant did not act with due diligence, as determined by the Commissioner.<P>
<DT><B>Date of Invention Can be Proved with Reference to Acts in WTO Member Countries</B><P>
<DD>Patent applicants will be entitled to establish dates of invention (e.g., for purposes of interferences and "swearing around" references) by reference to knowledge or use thereof, or other activity with respect thereto, in WTO Member Countries.  The rights of this provision are prospective.  An applicant cannot establish a date of invention that is earlier than 12 months after the effective date of the Act.<P>
<DT><B>Offers to Sell and Importing into the U.S. are Infringing Activity</B><P>
<DD>35 USC § 271 and other sections relating to infringement of patents have been amended to characterize "offers to sell" and "imports into the United States" as infringing acts.

<H2>INTRODUCTION:  PURPOSE AND APPLICATION</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Trade Secret Law Distinguished from Patent, Copyright, and Trademark Law.</B><P>
Trade secret law is a source of protection for intellectual property that serves as an alternative to patent, copyright, or trademark law.  While patent, copyright, and trademark law require that the intellectual property sought to be protected be publicly "disclosed" (for example, through a patent application), trade secret law requires precisely the opposite -- that is, that the intellectual property sought to be protected not be publicly disclosed.  Indeed, the subject matter of a trade secret may be virtually any information that is of value as a result of not being generally known.  Unlike copyright and patent law, there is no formal requirement of "novelty"  or "tangibility" under trade secret law.  Rather, trade secret protection is extended to information that has independent economic value by virtue of not being generally known or readily ascertainable by others and with respect to which reasonable efforts have been made to avoid public disclosure.<P>
<LI><B>Advantages and Disadvantages of Trade Secret Protection.</B><P>
There are both advantages and disadvantages to protecting intellectual property through the use of trade secret law.  The decision of whether to use trade secret law as opposed to other legal means of protecting knowledge or information will be governed primarily by the nature of the intellectual property sought to be protected.<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Primary Advantage:  Indefinite Future Protection.</B>  Unlike the seventeen-year time limit that underlies the protection granted to a patent holder, there is no definite time limit placed on the protection granted to a trade secret owner.  This indefinite future protection granted to trade secrets is appealing, assuming that the intellectual property sought to be protected is likely to remain generally unknown well into the future.  For example, if the intellectual property sought to be protected is a method of manufacturing a product that can be determined from examining the product -- that is, "reverse engineerable" -- then the best way to protect the new method of manufacture might be through a patent.  On the other hand, if the new method of manufacturing the product cannot be determined from examination of the product -- that is, is not reverse engineerable -- then the best way to protect the intellectual property might be to treat it as a trade secret.<P>
<LI><B>Primary Disadvantage:  No Protection from Independent Derivation or Reverse Engineering.</B>  Although there is no definite expiration of the protection granted to trade secrets, the protection prohibits only the disclosure or use of the trade secret by one to whom the secret was disclosed in confidence.  Unlike patent law, trade secret law does not offer any affirmative protection against the use of the same intellectual property that is independently derived or reverse engineered by a competitor.  Consequently, if the intellectual property sought to be protected is a new method of manufacturing a product, and if that method of manufacture is ascertainable from an examination of the product, then the best form of protection for the intellectual property is most likely that offered by patent law.  The same analysis applies to intellectual property that is likely to be independently derived by a competitor.<P>
</OL>
<LI><B>The Source of Trade Secret Protection:  State Law.</B><P>
Unlike patents and copyrights which are issued in accordance with federal law, trade secret protection emanates from state law.  The foundational principles of current trade secret doctrine was first adopted by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1868.  <EM>Peabody v. Norfolk</EM>, 98 Mass. 452 (1868).  In the 125 years since the Peabody decision, the courts, including numerous federal courts, have addressed trade secret issues and have contributed to the current body of trade secret law.  No federal legislation directly addressing trade secrets has been enacted, however.  Rather, legislation has been enacted on a state-by-state basis.  In 1980, Minnesota became the first state to adopt the Uniform Trade Secret Act.  (The "UTSA") (codified at Minn. Stat. §§ 325C.01-08).  Over half of the states have now adopted the UTSA.  The UTSA was drafted to address increasing reliance on trade secrets and to codify common trade secret principles.<P>
<LI><B>Operation and Application of the UTSA:  Valuable Information, Secrecy, Misappropriation, and Remedies.</B><P>
Under the UTSA and Minnesota law interpreting that statute, the existence of a trade secret is established by demonstrating that one: (1) has knowledge or information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable, and (2) has taken reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the knowledge or information.  Each of these two elements are addressed in more detail below.  The UTSA provides protection by prohibiting the "misappropriation" of trade secrets.  The various types of misappropriation are addressed in a separate section below.  Finally, there are a variety of remedies available to address the harm suffered by victims of trade secret misappropriation.  The various remedies are also addressed in a separate section.<P>
</DL>
<H2>THE FIRST REQUIREMENT OF TRADE SECRETS:  INFORMATION OR KNOWLEDGE VALUABLE BECAUSE NOT GENERALLY KNOWN</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Subject Matter of Trade Secrets.</B>  Trade secrets are not limited to particular subject matters.  Moreover, the knowledge or information sought to be protected need not take any particular form.  A trade secret can be information or knowledge in the form of a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process.<P>
<LI><B>Not Generally Known.</B>  For the information or knowledge, in any of the above forms, to be a trade secret, it must derive independent economic value because it is not generally known to, nor readily ascertainable by, other persons who can profit from its disclosure or use.  Minn. Stat. § 325c.01, subd. 5.<P>

The following is a list of subjects Minnesota Courts have held not to be trade secrets:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Integration of commonly known business methods does not achieve the degree of value needed for a trade secret.  (<EM>Fishing Concepts, Inc. v. Ross</EM>, 1985 WL 2718 (D.

<LI>Talent or expertise not protected by law of trade secrets (<EM>Electro-Craft Corp. v. Controlled Motion</EM>, 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983)).<P>
</OL>
<LI><B>Protection of Ideas</B><P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Certain Ideas Protected Under UTSA</B>.  Ideas were not protected at common law, but novel and concrete ideas may qualify for protection as trade secrets under the UTSA.<P>
<LI><B>Confidential Relationship.</B>  Recovery of damages for misappropriation of ideas may be permitted on the basis of a confidential relationship.  The elements that must be proved under this more common theory of recovery are: (1) a novel or original idea; (2) reduced to concrete form; (3) disclosed to the defendant in a confidential relationship, i.e., one in which it would be implied that use would not be made without compensation; and, (4) used by the defendant.<P>
<LI><B>Contractual Relationship.</B>  Recovery of damages may also be permitted on the basis of a contractual relationship.  Parties may enter into a contract to protect the idea being submitted.  The major benefit of a contract to the submitter of an idea is evidence of a protected disclosure.  The major benefit of a contract to the recipient of an idea is the establishment of the ground rules under which compensation, if any, will be payable to the submitter.<P>
<LI><B>Unsolicited Ideas.</B>  Corporations, many of whom often receive unsolicited ideas, must turn those unsolicited ideas into solicited ones to protect themselves from the uncertainties associated with this area of the law.  For example, an unsolicited idea could be returned to the sender with a cover letter to the following effect:<P>
</OL>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>
We shall be glad to examine your idea for a new . . . product, but only with the understanding that the use to be made of it by us, and the compensation, if any, to be paid by therefor, are matters resting solely in our discretion.<P>

</UL>
<H2>THE SECOND REQUIREMENT OF TRADE SECRETS:  REASONABLE EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN SECRECY</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>The Secrecy Requirement:  Efforts Reasonable Under the Circumstances.</B><P>
The second element necessary to establish the existence of a trade secret is that the knowledge or information sought to be protected must have been the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy.  The version of the UTSA adopted in Minnesota contains a provision that reduces the burden of secrecy placed on the owner of a trade secret.  Specifically, the Minnesota version of the UTSA provides that the existence of a trade secret is not negated merely because an employee or other person has acquired the trade secret without express or specific notice that it is a trade secret if, under all the circumstances, the employee or other person knows or has reason to know that the owner intends or expects the secrecy of the type of information comprising the trade secret to be maintained.  (Minn. Stat. § 325C.01 (subd. 5)).  Although this provision tips the scales in favor of trade secret protection, it should not be viewed as removing the affirmative obligation the UTSA places on one seeking protection of trade secrets.  Accordingly, every person or company that desires to protect its trade secrets under the UTSA should adopt and implement a trade secret protection plan.  Although the specific elements of such a plan will vary depending on the nature of the intellectual property sought to be protected as well as the circumstances surrounding its development and use, the following components should be considered in every situation.<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Memorialize the trade secret protection plan in writing.</B>  The person or company seeking to protect its intellectual property through the use of trade secret law should maintain a written statement of its trade secret security policy.  This statement can be written in the form of a policy manual and helps prevent situations in which "unwritten rules" are followed or rules are enforced in a lax manner and then eventually ignored.  Moreover, should litigation become necessary, it is easier to persuade a court that the security procedures were indeed a primary concern if they are reduced to writing.  (<EM>Compare  Electro-Craft Corp. v. Controlled Motion, Inc.</EM>, 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983) (reasonable efforts not taken where, among other things, plaintiff had no policy statement indicating what was confidential)) and <EM>Gordon Employment, Inc. v. Jewell</EM>, 356 N.W.2d 738 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984) (reasonable efforts not taken where, among other things, plaintiff had no policy on confidentiality)).<P>
<LI><B>Inform Employees of Trade Secrets.</B>  A trade secret protection plan must include a program for ensuring that employees are made aware of the trade secret status of information and that the employees are periodically reminded of their confidentiality obligations.  An essential part of this program is to make certain that employees are aware of and familiar with the written trade secret protection plan discussed above.  Employees should also be required to sign confidentiality agreements acknowledging that they have access to trade secret information, that they will not disclose or misappropriate that information, and that they will report all disclosures.  Finally, "exit interviews" should be conducted for employees leaving the company.  This interview provides an opportunity to remind employees of their written obligation not to disclose or misuse any trade secret information and to extend an open door to discuss any issues or concerns that may arise in connection with their future employment.  (<EM>Compare Electro-Craft Corp. v. Controlled Motion, Inc.</EM>, 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983) (confidentiality agreement signed by employees failed to identify with sufficient particularity what were and were not trade secrets; plaintiff began conducting "exit interviews" ten days after litigation commenced) and <EM>Gordon Employment, Inc. v. Jewel</EM>, 356 N.W.2d 738 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984) (confidentiality never discussed with employees)).<P>
<LI><B>Restrict Access to Trade Secrets.</B>  Trade secret information should be treated differently from nonproprietary information and should, if possible, be physically segregated.  In addition, access to the intellectual property should be restricted to those with a need to know or access the information.  Depending on the nature of the intellectual property sought to be protected, reasonably restricting access to trade secrets may be as simple as segregating the information in separate file drawers, or may require measures as extreme as designating an entirely separate facility to house the intellectual property.  (<EM>Compare Electro-Craft Corp. v. Controlled Motion, Inc.</EM>, 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983) (documents claimed to be secret were not kept in a central locked location) and <EM>Gordon Employment, Inc. v. Jewel</EM>, 356 N.W.2d 738 (Minn. App. Ct. 1984) (client lists claimed to be secrets were kept in an unlocked file)).<P>
<LI><B>Implement Physical Security Protection Measures.</B>  If possible under the circumstances, physical security measures should be instituted, including the use of locks on doors, gates, and cabinets containing trade secrets.  These physical security steps should be obvious to both employees and third parties who may have occasion to visit the area in which trade secrets are stored.  (<EM>Compare Electro-Craft Corp. v. Controlled Motion, Inc.</EM>, 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983) (plaintiff did not take adequate physical security measures)).<P>
<LI><B>Label Trade Secret Documents.</B>  Given the ease with which documents can be reproduced, trade secrets that are reduced to writing should be treated with special care.  Documents containing trade secrets should be clearly labeled with shorthand instructions that are consistent with the written trade secret protection plan.  Access to these documents should be monitored and all persons allowed access to the documents should be informed of the meaning of the trade secret designation on the document and the relevant provisions of the written trade secret protection plan.  This attention to detail should also be followed in arranging for proper destruction of the documents.  (<EM>Compare Electro-Craft Corp. v. Controlled Motion, Inc.</EM>, 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983) (no technical documents were marked "confidential")).<P>
<LI><B>Maintain Computer Secrecy.</B>  Like trade secrets that are reduced to writing, trade secrets stored on a computer system are particularly susceptible to theft.  Access to a computer system containing trade secrets should be restricted in accordance with the written trade secret protection plan and all physical computer-related items such as disks and printouts should contain the same trade secret legend used to identify documents containing intellectual property.<P>
<LI><B>Restrict Third Party Access to the Trade Secret Storage Area.</B>  When allowing third parties, be they members of the public or business associates, access to a facility in which trade secrets are stored or used, care must be taken to ensure that trade secrets are not inadvertently disclosed.  Disclosure can occur either passively or actively.  Passive disclosure might occur by carelessly leaving documents containing trade secrets in open view when business associates from another company visit your facility.  Active disclosure might occur during a guided tour of the facility when a tour guide reveals the nature of a project or process the company is working on or has recently perfected.  (<EM>Compare Electro-Craft Corp. v. Controlled Motion, Inc.</EM>, 332 N.W.2d 890 (Minn. 1983) (confidentiality procedures inadequate where, among other things, plaintiff allowed public tour of its plants)).<P>
<LI><B>Screen Speeches and Publications.</B>  The type of active trade secret disclosure that can occur outside of the facility where trade secrets are housed is through the dissemination of confidential information at trade shows, in magazine articles, publications, press releases, or during public speeches.  Such disclosures often occur unwittingly because they are made by marketing executives or midlevel managers who are not themselves instrumental in the development of the trade secret and who are often charged with a goal somewhat at odds with maintaining the secrecy of intellectual property - that is, their duty often is to disclose publicly the company's achievements.  Similar difficulties might arise when engineers or those responsible for the creation of trade secrets exchange ideas with their colleagues from other companies at professional seminars.  One method of curtailing such disclosures is to insist that all publications, articles, and speeches be reviewed and approved by a "filter" committee prior to dissemination. (<EM>Compare Fishing Concepts, Inc. v. Ross</EM>, 1985 WL 1549 (D. Minn. 1985) (information claimed secret was revealed in article published in advertising magazine)).<P>
<LI><B>Deal Cautiously with Outsiders:  Use Contracts.</B>  Although the very nature of many businesses requires that a company disclose its trade secrets to prospective buyers, licensees, joint venturers, or other outsiders, this does not mean that a company must surrender all rights to its trade secrets.  Rather, when the company enters into a transaction with a third party, it should cautiously monitor the flow of information to the third party and document the nature of the trade secrets exposed and the specific limited use to which they may be put.  (<EM>Compare Fishing Concepts, Inc. v. Ross</EM>, 1985 WL 1549 (D. Minn. 1985) (information not secret where plaintiff revealed information during negotiations with defendants absent warning that information was confidential)).<P>

<H2>UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF TRADE SECRETS</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>"Misappropriation" Defined: Improper Acquisition, Disclosure or Use.</B><P>
The enforcement provisions of the UTSA that give teeth to the protection granted by that statute are triggered by the actual or threatened "misappropriation" of one's trade secrets.  "Misappropriation" is defined in two ways: (1) acquisition of a trade secret through improper means; or (2) disclosure or use of a trade secret without consent.<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>"Acquisition" Through "Improper Means."</B>  The first type of misappropriation under the UTSA is acquisition of a trade secret through improper means.  Specifically, the UTSA prohibits the "acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know the trade secret was acquired by improper means."  (Minn. Stat. § 325C.01 (subd. 3)).  "Improper means" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other means.  (Minn. Stat. § 325C.01 (subd. 2)).  In short, the first type of misappropriation is the mere possession of a trade secret that has been acquired through theft or the breach of a duty to maintain the secrecy of the trade secret.<P>
<LI><B>Disclosure or Use Without Consent.</B>  The second type of misappropriation under the UTSA is the disclosure or use of someone else's trade secret without their express or implied consent.  Although the statutory definition is somewhat complicated, the UTSA basically prohibits the disclosure or use of a trade secret that one possesses as a result of theft, breach of a duty to maintain its secrecy or an accident or mistake on the part of the trade secret owner.  In short, the UTSA prohibits the disclosure or use of a trade secret that one possesses as a result of "improper means" as defined in the preceding paragraph.  The rule of thumb is that if you possess, disclose, or use a trade secret that you know or have reason to know is not intended to be revealed to you, beware.<P>
</OL>
<LI><B>The UTSA Protects Against Both Actual and Threatened Misappropriation.</B><P>
As indicated above, the UTSA's definition of misappropriation is rather broad.  The protection granted trade secret owners under the UTSA is further expanded by prohibiting both the actual and threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.  The distinction between these two types of misappropriation is basically one of timing.  As might be suspected, the UTSA prohibits the actual disclosure of trade secrets and provides remedies for those whose trade secrets have already been misappropriated.  A more difficult question arises, however, with respect to a trade secret owner's rights prior to the actual misappropriation of trade secrets.  To address a trade secret owner's legitimate concerns that misappropriation may occur in the future, the UTSA prohibits "threatened" misappropriation.<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Actual misappropriation:  The Less Difficult Case.</B>  A trade secret owner may assert legal rights subsequent to any actual unauthorized disclosure or use of trade secrets.  In such situations, the wrong has already occurred and the trade secret owner may seek judicial intervention concerning any legal rights that were violated.  This is true regardless of whether the misappropriator obtained the secret without the owner's consent, or originally with consent but later used the secret for the misappropriator's own gain.  One should not be misled by the characterization of an actual misappropriation case as "less difficult," however.  An actual misappropriation case is less difficult only when compared to a threatened misappropriation case.  The burden of proof in an actual misappropriation case is still squarely on the shoulders of the trade secret owner who is alleging that his or her trade secrets have been misappropriated.  This burden of proof requires the trade secret owner to demonstrate that he or she was in possession of knowledge or information that was not generally known and was valuable precisely because it was not generally known, and that the knowledge or information was subject to efforts that were reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  Depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case, together with the nature of the intellectual property sought to be protected, proving the elements necessary to make out a trade secret case can be a most challenging undertaking.  The best way to establish a foundation for successful prosecution of trade secret misappropriation is to follow closely the provisions of a written trade secret protection plan, as discussed above.<P>
<LI><B>Threatened Misappropriation:  The More Difficult Case.</B>  Perhaps the most interesting trade secret cases involve the alleged threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.  In these cases, the trade secret owner does not contend that their trade secrets have already been compromised, but rather that unless some action is taken to halt the current progress of events, their trade secrets will be misappropriated at some time in the future.  Threatened misappropriation cases often arise when a highly-skilled or trained employee who has been exposed to a company's trade secrets leaves the company's employ and goes to work for a competitor.  On the one hand, the former employer may well have legitimate concerns about possible disclosure of its trade secrets to a competitor; on the other hand, the employee has a right to work for the employer of his choice.  Consequently, courts are required to balance these competing interests.  The result often depends on the legitimacy of the trade secret owner's concerns of misappropriation and the nature of the evidence that is available to substantiate those concerns.<P>
<LI><B>Relevant Considerations in a Threatened Misappropriation Context.</B>  When faced with a situation where an employee who has been exposed to trade secrets leaves to work for a new employer, courts typically consider three factors:  (1) whether the former employer and the new employer are competitors; (2) whether the employee's new position is comparable to his or her former position; and (3) the efficacy of steps taken by the new employer to prevent the misappropriation of trade secrets.  (<EM>Surgidev Corp. v. Eye Technology Inc.</EM>, 648 F. Supp. 661, 695 (D.Minn. 1986), aff'd, 828 F.2d 452 (8th Cir. 1987)).<P>
<LI><B>Mere Suspicion of Misappropriation is Insufficient.</B>  Mere suspicion that another party may have wrongfully disclosed or used one's trade secrets, in itself, does not enable the trade secret owner to assert rights successfully.  Courts will not prohibit the wrongful use or disclosure of one's trade secrets based upon the mere uneasiness or suspicions of the trade secret owner.  Rather, the trade secret owner is required to demonstrate that its concerns of misappropriation are legitimate.  In most situations, this means that the trade secret owner will be required to present evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that misappropriation is likely to occur.<P>
<LI><B>The Most Legitimate Concerns:  Those Supported by Direct Evidence.</B>  A trade secret owner can often present direct evidence to demonstrate that there is an imminent threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.  Direct evidence exists when the trade secret owner can demonstrate that action already had been taken, or words already have been spoken, which indicate that misappropriation of trade secrets is going to occur.  Common examples of direct evidence supporting a trade secret owner's legitimate concerns of threatened misappropriation are statements made by the former employee or the new employer.  Former employees might make statements about the relative lack of weight they give to their former employer's confidentiality policies.  Similarly, the new employer might make statements about the purpose of hiring the new employee, why other potential employees were rejected, or the nature of the duties the new employee will be required to perform.  Based on evidence of such actions or statements, a court is likely to protect one's trade secrets by enjoining prospectively their wrongful use or disclosure.<P>
<LI><B>Demonstrating Legitimate Concerns Through Use of Circumstantial Evidence.</B>  In most situations, direct evidence concerning the likelihood of misappropriation does not exist.  In such cases, a trade secret owner can present circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that the unauthorized use or disclosure of trade secrets is imminently threatened.  Circumstantial evidence demonstrating that imminent misappropriation is likely to occur consists of two types:  (1)  evidence demonstrating the intent of a party to elicit the wrongful disclosure of the trade secret, and (2) evidence demonstrating that the wrongful disclosure or use of a trade secret is inevitable regardless of any party's intentions.  Evidence demonstrating the intent of the new employer to elicit trade secrets from its new employee takes many forms.  Often, a trade secret owner can show that the new employer desires the trade secret and has unsuccessfully attempted to acquire the trade secret information by proper means, either from the trade secret owner, other parties, or independent derivation or reverse engineering.  The new employer's intent to misappropriate trade secrets can also be demonstrated by showing that the new employer solicited the trade secret owner's employees and has not made any efforts to solicit employees from the industry in general.  Second, in addition to circumstantial evidence demonstrating an intention to elicit improper disclosure of trade secrets, a trade secret owner can show that such disclosure is inevitable by virtue of the particular circumstances of the situation.  This showing is most frequently demonstrated by evidence that the work to be performed by the former employee is very similar to the work previously performed for the trade secret owner, and that the former employee will be unable to perform his new job conscientiously without revealing trade secrets previously learned.  Although circumstantial evidence is generally not considered as strong as direct evidence, it is clear that courts will issue injunctions prohibiting the misappropriation of trade secrets based solely on circumstantial evidence that indicates such activity is imminently likely to occur.<P>
</OL>
<LI><B>A Warning:  Act Promptly to Avoid Waiver.</B><P>
A trade secret owner who suspects that either actual or threatened misappropriation has occurred or is likely to occur must act promptly to enforce his or her legal rights.  Although the statute of limitations under the UTSA is three years, courts have the power to deny the relief requested by trade secret owners even when an action has been initiated within the statute of limitations period, if the action has not been initiated reasonably promptly.  The UTSA assumes that a trade secret owner who suspects misappropriation will move with reasonable alacrity to protect his or her intellectual property and recognizes that if such action is not taken, then third parties may materially change their positions in a good-faith belief that no trade secret rights have been violated.  Under such circumstances, a court may find that the trade secret owner has waived its right to seek protection under the UTSA.<P>
</UL>
<H2>REMEDIES</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Remedies Available.</B>  The UTSA provides a full panoply of remedies, including statutory damages, injunctive relief, damages, attorney's fees and exemplary damages.  Minn. Stat. § 325C.02-04.<P>
<LI><B>Injunctive Relief.</B>  Under the UTSA, injunctive relief is available to enjoin actual, as well as threatened, misappropriation.  The ability to enjoin threatened misappropriation is very important because it enables the owner of the trade secret to prevent public disclosure of the trade secret.  (<EM>Standard Brands, Inc. v. Zumpe</EM>, 264 F. Supp. 254, 269 (E.D. La. 1967).  The UTSA provides that the injunction shall terminate once the trade secret ceases to exist, but may be continued for a reasonable period of time to extinguish any commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.  This is especially important where, at the time of the action, the information or knowledge is no longer a trade secret.  In such a case, the court may still award the plaintiff injunctive relief that is narrowly crafted to deprive the defendant of the benefit of time saved by improper use of plaintiff's trade secret.  See, e.g., <EM>Cherne Indus., Inc. v. Grounds & Associates</EM>, 278 N.W.2d 81 (Minn. 1979).  In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may entitle the owner of the trade secret to a royalty for the period of time during which the use of the trade secret was prohibited.<P>
<LI><B>Damages.</B>  Damages under the UTSA are measured by the actual loss caused by the misappropriation as well as any resulting unjust enrichment.  Where the amount of actual loss or unjust enrichment cannot be accurately calculated, the UTSA provides that damages may also be measured by the imposition of a reasonable royalty for the misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of the trade secret.<P>
<LI><B>Exemplary Damages.</B>  Exemplary damages may be awarded where the court finds that the misappropriation was willful and malicious.  (See, e.g., <EM>Aries Information Sys., Inc. v. Pacific Management Sys. Corp.</EM>, 366 N.W.2d 366 (Minn. Ct. App. 1985)).  Such an award may not exceed twice the amount of the damage award.  Minn. Stat. § 325c.03(b).  A plaintiff's entitlement to exemplary damages under the UTSA is not subject to the requirements for punitive damages under Minn. Stat. § 549.20.  (See generally <EM>Zawels v. Edutronics, Inc.</EM>, 520 N.W.2d 520 (Minn. Ct. App. 1994).)  (To be entitled to punitive damages under Minn. Stat. § 549.20, a plaintiff must show deliberate disregard of another's rights or safety.)<P>
<LI><B>Attorney's Fees.</B>  The court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing party in exceptional circumstances.  A bad faith claim of misappropriation, a bad faith resistance to a motion to terminate an injunction, or a finding of willful and malicious appropriation are exceptional circumstances in which an award of attorney's fees may be appropriate.  Courts are generally not inclined to award attorney's fees, however, even where the evidence supports a finding of bad faith.  (See, e.g., <EM>Gordon Employment, Inc. v. Jewel</EM>, 356 N.W.2d 738 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984).)<P>

<TITLE>How to manage your Intellectual Property</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<DL>
<DD>Companies dependent on technological innovation for competitive advantage have been cognizant of the potential value of their intellectual property ("IP") since at least the early 19th century.  In recent years, the idea of the "intellectual property audit" has gained great currency among engineering managers and IP lawyers.  It appears, however, that issues surrounding the creation, enhancement, exploitation and protection of IP are becoming ever more pervasive.  According to the cover story in the October 3, 1994 issue of Fortune Magazine, IP - or a more broadly defined but closely related concept, intellectual capital - is increasingly being recognized as many companies' "most valuable asset."<P>
As a result, more companies are devoting greater resources to developing disciplined means of managing IP (and also other knowledge resources whether or not they are legally protectible) from a broad business (as opposed to a legal/technical) perspective.  "What's at stake is nothing less than learning how to operate and evaluate a business when knowledge is its chief resource and result."  Fortune, Oct. 3, 1994, at 68.<P>
Even for many companies in more traditional businesses, IP assets can provide significant competitive benefits.  Of course, as with other items that vie for management attention and company resources, the trick is to apply the right amount of financial and personal resources in the right way at the right time to create and exploit the IP that has the best effect on the company's bottom line.  Following are some broad suggestions for approaching the legal (and closely related business) components of that task.<P>
</DL>
<H2>Step 1:  Make One or More People Specifically Responsible</H2>
<UL>
<LI>In technology-driven companies, the natural place to look for IP leadership is in the ranks of scientific and engineering management; in fact, some basic level of such leadership is usually in place.  Often it is still possible and desirable to achieve greater definition of responsibility for functions such as training both new and more senior technical people in the administration of research (keeping lab books, etc.), the disclosure and evaluation of inventions, decisions whether to file patent applications, and the like.<P>
<LI>Other people who may be needed to fill out the ranks of an IP management team may include in-house counsel, strategic marketing planners, other marketing or sales executives, and other general or financial executives with strategic planning responsibilities.  In designating the team, don't overlook the importance of (and need to manage) the non-technical IP, such as trademarks, service marks and many copyrights.<P>
</UL>
<H2>Step 2:  Assess the Nature and Organization of Your Existing IP</H2>
<UL>
<LI>This step is frequently referred to as conducting an "intellectual property audit."  Depending on how much effort and attention you've already devoted to managing your IP, you may need to hold an organizational meeting or two to decide on a game plan to assess your existing IP.  IP audits come in various shapes and sizes.  Depending on the urgency of your timing, the nature of your business and the existing level of sophistication of your designated team about IP matters, you may be able to accomplish much or most of the work in house.  Thus, as with many other types of projects, a bit of organizational effort at the front end can pay considerable dividends.  Among the topics deserving of early consideration (and later revisiting as more information is gathered and greater understanding and consensus is achieved) are the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Does the IP management team and/or the audit project team have the necessary and appropriate members (see Step 1 above)?<P>
<LI>What preliminary information should be gathered at an early stage (e.g., lists of all patents, trademarks, etc. in existing portfolio, organizational charts and so forth)?<P>
<LI>If the enterprise is conducted through a group of related corporations or other entities rather than in a single legal entity, consider which entity owns (and which entity should own) which IP, as well as which entities actually use which IP.  This exercise may suggest additional tax planning and/or documentation of licenses between various of the related entities.  If your operations have an international component, variations in the IP laws of different countries could also result in issues and potential problems that can be alleviated with advance attention to these types of details.<P>
<LI>Make sure all team members (including outside counsel) compare notes and have some basic preliminary orientation and understanding as to the competitive significance of various types of IP in your business and industry.  For example, do companies in your industry have a propensity for patent litigation or are they at least somewhat inclined to engage in licensing or cross-licensing?  Do they even bother with patent protection at all?<P>
<LI>Determine which internal team members will gather which categories of documents and information.  To the extent time and internal resources permit, try to educate inside team members as to the key basic principles of IP law, and have them participate extensively in the fact gathering process.<P>
<LI>Determine what general level of detail appears appropriate for various categories of IP.  In technology-driven companies, you will more likely find it desirable to focus first, and possibly foremost, on patent and trade secret-related activities and issues.  Other companies may find copyright and/or trademark issues of greater moment.<P>
</OL>
<LI>As observed at the outset, one of the most important chores is to determine the appropriate level of resources to devote to the task.  Legal counsel will need to avoid the temptation to go overboard in conducting the review, while many business people will need to avoid the temptation to draw premature conclusions about their company's IP assets and potential assets without first gathering a reasonably rounded information base and engaging in some thoughtful reevaluation of their assumptions about what's important and what's not in their company's operations.
</UL>
<H2>Step 3:  Plug the Significant Holes That You Find (If You Can)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Plugging holes is often easier said than done.  You may have subject matter that would have been patentable but has been disclosed in a published technical paper or incorporated in products that were sold long enough ago to trigger the sale bar.  You may not have an adequate form of invention agreement in place with your employees but may be unwilling or unable to provide consideration sufficient under applicable state law to support the imposition of a more adequate form on existing employees.  You may have categories of information that you would like to try to protect as trade secrets and find that you have been demonstrably lax in protecting them, to the point where there is cause for concern that you will be found to have failed to take reasonable steps to protect them within the meaning of applicable trade secrets laws.<P>
</UL>
<H2>Step 4:  Look for Additional Ways to Augment Your IP Portfolio</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Technology-driven companies, especially, have an increasing number of ways to augment their IP assets.  Some of the more popular ways are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Acquisitions of product lines or entire businesses for their IP assets<P>
<LI>Corporate partnering: finding joint venture partners with complementary IP and other assets and competencies, and strategic plans<P>
<LI>Licensing in, i.e., finding another owner of IP assets that is willing and able to license them to you at a reasonable cost<P>
<LI>Government research grants<P>
<LI>Cooperative research with government and/or academic research labs<P>
<LI>The old-fashioned way: do it yourself<P>
</OL>
<LI>Each of these methods has its characteristic benefits, burdens, risks and pitfalls.  All entail significant up-front costs and risks of failure, and many entail ongoing risks and complexities by virtue of the fact that more than one entity obtains a permanent or extended interest in the IP in question, and all of the involved entities must plan and negotiate to protect their interests under various contingent and changing economic, competitive and technological scenarios.<P>
</UL>
<H2>Step 5:  Look for Ways to Realize a Return on Investment in Non-Core IP</H2>
<UL>
<LI>You may find that you have technology or trademarks that are more valuable to someone else than they are to you.  Many of the strategies to obtain a greater return on such forms of IP are the flip sides of some of those mentioned above in Step 4:  for example, sale of a particular product line or a patent, or licensing out.  The costs, complexities and pitfalls likewise have flip sides.<P>
</UL>
<H2>Step 6:  Vigilant Maintenance</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Once you feel you have a basic handle on your IP assets, you are ready to tackle the job of ongoing maintenance.  Among the more common methods are the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Hold regular periodic (at least semi-annual) meetings of your IP management team, including legal counsel.  Technology-driven companies should have the team meet as often as monthly or even bi-weekly.<P>
<LI>Keep track of what your competitors are doing.  Monitor the technical aspects of their new product offerings.  Monitor patent and trademark databases.  Technology-driven companies should think globally; there may be information available about your competitors' patent activities internationally even though the confidential nature of U.S. patent applications presently renders the cognate U.S. information unavailable during the pendency of such applications.<P>
<LI>Educate new employees and provide periodic refreshers and written materials to appropriate categories of existing employees.  Technology-driven companies frequently prepare fairly extensive manuals for their scientific and engineering employees to educate them and ensure the full capture of the record to support the company's claims to internally generated inventions.<P>
<LI>Evaluate IP disputes or potential disputes with great caution.  IP litigation is frequently very expensive, whether you win or lose.  You should take infringement risks seriously, however.  In recent years there have been a number of patent and trade secret cases in which the damages awarded have been in the range of tens of millions, and even hundreds of millions, of dollars.  Develop a policy and procedure to protect your company from liability for apparent misappropriation of unsolicited ideas and inventions of individual inventors.<P>
</OL>
</UL>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<DL>
<DD>The foregoing overview merely scratches the surface of an extensive topic that is of vital concern to many companies.  Hopefully, however, it can help you to begin to develop the broader perspective that is frequently absent if you have been in the habit of managing your IP one item at a time.

<TITLE>The role of insurance in Intellectual Property disputes</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<DL>
<DD>Intellectual property litigation is on the rise.  Intellectual property litigation is expensive.  These two fundamental facts have led to increased attention in recent years to the role of insurance coverage in intellectual property disputes.  Insurance can save defendants hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation expenses as well as provide protection against exposure to potentially multi-million dollar judgments.  Insurance can also impact the litigation strategy of both plaintiffs and defendants.  Because every business is a potential litigant in an intellectual property dispute, an appreciation of the issues surrounding the existence and enforcement of insurance coverage for such disputes is critical.<P>
</DL>
<H2>Insurance Coverage under the Standard CGL Policy</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Businesses commonly purchase Comprehensive General Liability (CGL) insurance to protect against business tort claims.  Absent a specific endorsement or policy for intellectual property claims, the CGL is frequently the only potential source for intellectual property claim coverage.<P>
<LI><B>"Advertising Injury"</B><P>
Of course, the exact coverage afforded depends on the wording of the individual policy.  CGL policies typically use the standard language of Insurance Services Office (ISO) CGL forms, often with modifications.  For many intellectual property claims, the most likely source of coverage is the "Advertising Injury" coverage clause.<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Pre-1986 Broad Form Endorsement</B><P>
In 1986, ISO revised its standard CGL form, including the "Advertising Injury" coverage sections.  Many businesses, however, continue to purchase policies utilizing the pre-1986 "Advertising Injury" provisions.  In addition, most of the litigation concerning coverage for intellectual property claims has focused on the pre-1986 language.<P>
The pre-1986 CGL standard policy typically defines "Advertising Injury" for which coverage is provided as:  "Injury arising out of an offense committed during the policy period occurring in the course of the named insured's advertising activities, if such injury arises out libel, slander, defamation, violation of right of privacy, piracy, unfair competition or infringement of copyright, title or slogan."<P>
<LI><B>Post-1986 CGL Standard Form</B><P>
The post-1986 Advertising Injury language generally provides:<P>
"'Advertising Injury' means injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products, or services;<P>
<LI>Oral or written publication of material that violates a person's right of privacy;<P>
<LI>Misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business; or<P>
<LI>Infringement of copyright, title or slogan."<P>
</OL>
The current standard CGL policy also contains a provision stating that the insurance applies only to "advertising injury" caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising goods, products or services.<P>
</OL>
<LI><B>Rules of Insurance Policy Interpretation.</B><P>
<OL>
<LI>State law governs.<P>
<LI>As a contract of adhesion, ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafter and in favor of the insured.<P>
<LI>The policy is to be interpreted in accordance with the "reasonable expectations" of the insured.  Atwater Creamery Co. v. Western Nat'l Mut., 366 N.W.2d 271 (Minn. 1985).<P>
<LI>Duty to Defend Broader than Duty to Indemnify.<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>If any part of the cause of action arguably falls within scope of coverage, the insurer must defend the entire action.  John Deere Ins. Co. v. Shamrock Indus., Inc., 929 F.2d 413, 417 (8th Cir. 1991); Josten's, Inc. v. CNA Ins. Co., 336 N.W.2d 544 (Minn. 1983).<P>
<LI>Doubts resolved in favor of the insured.  Lanoue v. Fireman's Fund American Ins. Co., 278 N.W.2d 49, 53 (Minn. 1979).<P>
<LI>Non-intellectual property infringement claims can form basis for duty to defend against IP claims.  John Deere, 696 F. Supp. at 434, aff'd 929 F.2d 413 (8th Cir. 1991).<P>
</OL>
</OL>
<LI><B>Patent Infringement</B><P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Patent Infringement As "Advertising Injury."</B><P>
Some courts have found coverage for a patent infringement claim under the CGL advertising injury clause.  Several well-reasoned recent cases, however, have held that a CGL affords no coverage for such claims.  As with many issues, the existence of coverage for a patent infringement claim requires case-specific analysis.  Leading cases:<P>
Intex Plastics Sales Co. v. United Nat'l Ins. Co., 23 F.3d 254 (9th Cir. 1994).<P>
Bank of the West v. Superior Court, 833 P.2d 545 (Cal. 1992).<P>

<LI>Case Law Is Sparse:<P>
The P.J. Noyes Co. v. American Motorists Ins. Co., 31 USPQ 2d 1790 (D.N.H. 1994)(Coverage found as alleged trademark infringement would not have occurred but for use of term in packaging, literature, and advertisements.)<P>

Co., 31 USPQ 2d 1202 (6th Cir. 1994)(Insurance company had no duty to defend suit for, inter alia, trademark infringement in view of policy exclusion for advertising offenses although policy provides coverage for advertising injury occurring in course of "unfair competition").<P>

<H2>Insurance Tailored for Intellectual Property Infringement Claims</H2>
<UL>
<LI>In light of the uncertainties involved in the existence of coverage for IP disputes under the standard CGL policy, it is not surprising that some insurance companies market insurance products tailored for coverage of intellectual property infringement claims.  On the market today are policies designed for patent infringement and trademark infringement claims coverage.<P>
<LI>Each business must make its own cost/benefit analysis with respect to purchasing additional policies specifically for intellectual property disputes.  In light of the trend finding no coverage for patent infringement claims under standard CGL language, high technology businesses and others who deal extensively with patented or potentially patentable products should consider this alternative.<P>
</UL>
<H2>Insurance for Plaintiffs</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Insurance is no longer available exclusively to defendants in intellectual property disputes.  The high cost of prosecuting intellectual property infringement claims has led to the advent of insurance policies which will pay expenses a business incurs in enforcing its intellectual property rights. This product may be attractive to small businesses which otherwise lack the financial resources to aggressively pursue infringers.  At least one company markets insurance of this type with respect to patents, trademarks, and copyrights.<P>
</UL>
<H2>Insurance and Litigation Strategy</H2>
<UL>
<LI>When faced with defending a claim of intellectual property infringement, a business and its counsel must promptly determine whether insurance coverage exists.<P>
<LI>If coverage arguably exists, notification and tender of defense should be made.  If insurer rejects tender, consider filing a declaratory judgment action.<P>
<LI>Watch for allocation issues where indemnification is available on one claim but not others.<P>
<LI>Plaintiff should consider the issue of insurance coverage for the defendant in preparing its case.<P>
<OL>
<LI>Insurance can ease collection of judgment.<P>
<LI>Insurance can enable a more vigorous defense.<P>
<LI>Strategic pleading of facts and claims can maximize/minimize chances of insurance coverage.

<TITLE>UCC issues and Intellectual Property</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<DL>
<DD>Intellectual Property can be the subject of many of the provisions of the UCC, but there are only three places in the UCC where Intellectual Property is directly addressed: once in Article 2, Sales, and twice in Article 9, Secured Transactions.  A basic understanding how these provisions of the UCC effect your company's intellectual property is necessary to ensure adequate protection of your interests in any sales transactions.
</DL>
<H2>UCC INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROVISIONS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>A warranty against infringement is imposed by UCC 2-312 (3) on  sellers who are "merchants" (i.e., a person who deals in goods of the kind or...holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction...).<P>
<LI>The risk of infringement shifts, however, if the buyer furnishes specifications for the goods to the seller.<P>
<LI>Turning now to Article 9, UCC 9-106 encompasses Intellectual Property inferentially in the definition of "General Intangibles" as "any personal property...other than goods, accounts, chattel paper, documents, instruments, and money."  The Official Comment expressly states that patents, trademarks, copyrights and rights to receive payments under licenses thereof are examples of general intangibles.<P>
<LI>Finally, UCC 9-104 excludes from Article 9 security interests subject to federal statute when that statute "governs the rights of parties to and third parties affected by transactions in particular types of property...."<P>
<LI>The Official Comment mentions both the Federal Copyright Act and a provision of a prior version of the federal patent laws and says that "the filing provisions under these Acts...are recognized as the equivalent to filing under this Article."
</UL>
<H2>CASES</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The courts have had little trouble applying UCC 2-312 (3), possibly because the risk allocation is logical and straightforward.  In <EM>Dolori Fabrics, Inc. v. Limited Inc.</EM>, 662 F. Supp. 1347, 3 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) 1753 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), the court stated that the "policy underlying this statute -- that a merchant who regularly deals in like goods has a duty to insure that no claim of infringement by a third party mars the buyer's title - applies equally well to claims of copyright infringement." Id. at 1358.<P>
<LI>To obtain the protection of the warranty by a seller in UCC 2-312 (3), a buyer must first notify the seller that a claim of infringement has been made against the goods purchased from the seller. <EM>Gates Energy Prod., Inc. v. Yuasa Battery Co.</EM>, 599 F. Supp 368, 223 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 660 (D. Colo. 1983).<P>
<LI>A buyer cannot "tag" a seller for the warranty against infringement unless the products sold by the seller are the items giving rise to the claim of infringement.  In <EM>Chemtron, Inc. v. Aqua Prods.</EM>, 830 F. Supp. 314, 28 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) 1877 (E.D. Va. 1993), the court declined to hold the seller of non-infringing component parts liable on the UCC warranty against infringement when it was the total apparatus, and not the component parts, that was accused.<P>
<LI>There is considerable variation in the opinions as to the proper place to file financing statements to perfect a security interest in Intellectual Property.  The usual choices are: i) the appropriate Secretary of State (under the UCC), and/or ii) the appropriate assignment branch of the federal Patent and Trademark or Copyright Office.  Evidencing this split of authority, the court in In <EM>re Peregrine Entertainment Ltd.</EM>, 16 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) 1017 (C.D. Cal. 1990) in an appeal from a bankruptcy court decision, decided that the Federal Copyright Office was the proper place to file, citing federal preemption.  In reaching this result, the court expressly rejected other district court cases and bankruptcy court cases holding that the state system (UCC filing) was the appropriate place of filing a financing statement.
</UL>
<H2>THE FUTURE</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Efforts are being made to legislate the proper place for filing financing statements, however, there is no clear indication that a single system will be implemented in the foreseeable future; because of this, the cases are expected to continue to diverge, with some ratifying state filing and some upholding federal filing.<P>
<LI>Revision of Article 2 of the UCC is underway in attempt to address issues arising in connection with software transactions.  Certain provisions regarding the extension of warranties of "merchantability," accuracy of data, and "fitness for purpose" to the delivery of intangibles (such as software) are under consideration at this time.<P>
<LI>One approach is to provide an "implied" warranty of quality instead of merchantability; this proposal focuses on the description or documentation offered by the transferor or agreed to by the parties and is embodied in Option 1 of Proposed Section 2-2222, as a "transaction-based" approach.  Option 2 provides a more general standard, that of "merchantability" of the performance and media of the intangibles delivered.  However, this option shifts to the standard presented in Option 1 when there are no comparable uses to establish a general level of merchantability for the intangibles in question.<P>
<LI>Another proposed section provides an implied warranty as to the correctness or accuracy of information and data supplied as the intangible. Proposed Section 2-2223 gives an implied warranty that the supplier will use reasonable care and workmanlike effort, but that "zero errors" are not the standard.  Furthermore, the warranty is not implied when the data are in public records known to the transferee, when the data or information is only incidental (and therefore not "material") to the transaction, and when the intangibles are created by a third party and identified as such.<P>
<LI>As to warranties of fitness, Proposed Section 2-2224 provides that the supplier will use reasonable care and workmanlike effort to achieve the transferee's objectives and purposes when the supplier has at least reason to know that the transferee is relying on the supplier's expertise.  There is a special subsection that obligates a system supplier to a warranty that the [hardware and software] parts of the system selected by that supplier will "function together as a system consistent with the goals of the licensee known or communicated to the licensor."<P>
</UL>
A complete listing of the sections and proposed sections discussed above follows. 
<H2>336.2-312 Warranty of Title and Against Infringement; Buyer's Obligation Against Infringement</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Subject to subsection (2) there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>the title conveyed shall be good, and its transfer rightful; and<P>
<LI>the goods shall be delivered free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge.<P>
</OL>
<LI>A warranty under subsection (1) will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have.<P>
<LI>Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.
</OL>
<H2>336.9-106 Definitions:  "Account;" "General Intangibles"</H2>
<DL>
<DD>"Account" means any right to payment for goods sold or leased or for services rendered which is not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper whether or not it  has been earned by performance.  "General Intangibles" means any personal property (including things in action) other than goods, accounts, chattel paper, documents, instruments and money.  All rights earned or unearned under a charter or other contract involving the use or hire of a vessel and all rights incident to the charter or contract are accounts.
</DL>
<H2>336.9-104 Transactions Excluded From Article</H2>
<DL>
<DD>This article does not apply<P>
<OL>
<LI>to a security interest subject to any statute of the United States such as the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920, to the extent that such statute governs the rights of parties to and third parties affected by transactions in particular types of property; or<P>
<LI>to a landlord's lien; or<P>
<LI>to a lien given by statute or other rule of law for services or materials except as provided in section 336.9-310 on priority of such liens; or<P>
<LI>to a transfer of a claim for wages, salary or other compensation of an employee; or<P>
<LI>to a transfer by a government or governmental subdivision or agency to the extent that this article conflicts with special statutory provisions relating to such a transfer; or<P>
<LI>to a sale of accounts or chattel paper as part of a sale of the business out of which they arose, or an assignment of accounts or chattel paper which is for the purpose of collection only, or a transfer of a right to payment under a contract to an assignee who is also to do the performance under the contract or a transfer of a single account to an assignee in whole or partial satisfaction of a preexisting indebtedness; or<P>
<LI>to a transfer of an interest or claim in or under any policy of insurance, except as provided with reference to proceeds (section 336.9-306) and priorities in proceeds (section 336.9-312); or<P>
<LI>to a right represented by a judgment (other than a judgment taken on a right to payment which was collateral); or<P>
<LI>to any right to setoff; or<P>
<LI>except to the extent that provision is made for fixtures in section 336.9-313, to the creation or transfer of an interest in or lien on real estate, including a lease or rents thereunder; or<P>
<LI>to a transfer in whole or in part of any claim arising out of tort; or<P>
<LI>to a transfer of an interest in any deposit account (subsection (l) of section 336.9-105), except as provided with respect to proceeds (section 336.9-306) and priorities in proceeds (section 336.9-312); or<P>
<LI>except to the extent this article is not superseded by sections 327.61 to 327.67, to the repossession of a manufactured home meeting the definition contained in section 327.62.<P>
</OL>
</DL>
<H2>PROPOSED SECTION 2-2222. IMPLIED WARRANTY, QUALITY OF PRODUCT</H2>
<DL>
<DD>Option 1<P>
<OL>
<LI>If intangibles are delivered to a licensee in a form directly capable of use in a machine or otherwise to produce a practical result other than mere communication, processing, or reproduction of the information or data that comprise the intangible and the licensor is a merchant with respect to intangibles of this kind, the licensor warrants that the intangibles will perform in substantial conformance with any documentation, specifications, or other descriptions provided by the transferor or agreed to by the parties.<P>
<LI>In a mass market license within subsection (a), the implied warranty is a warranty of merchantability to be interpreted as in Section ---- [merchantability in sales of goods].<P>
</OL>
<DD>Option 2<P>
<OL>
<LI>If intangibles are delivered to a licensee in a form directly capable of use in a machine or otherwise to produce a practical result other than mere communication, processing, or reproduction of the information or data that comprise the intangibles and the licensor is a merchant with respect to intangibles of this kind, the licensor warrants that the performance of the intangibles and the quality of any media on which they are transferred will be of merchantable quality.  Merchantable quality is to be interpreted as in Section ---- [merchantability in sales of goods].<P>
<LI>In cases covered by subsection (a), if there is no ordinary use to which the intangibles can be compared, the warranty is a warranty that the intangibles as delivered will perform in substantial conformance with any documentation, specifications, or other descriptions provided by the transferor or agreed to be the parties.<P>
</OL>
</DL>
<H2>PROPOSED SECTION 2-2223. IMPLIED WARRANTY, INFORMATION AND SERVICES</H2>
<OL>
<LI>If the licensor provides services, information, data, data processing or the like, there is a warranty that the licensor will use reasonable care and workmanlike effort in providing the services and in collecting, compiling, or transmitting the information or data.<P>
<LI>The warranty in subsection (a) is not breached merely because  the services do not yield a result consistent with the objectives of the transferee or because the information or data are not accurate.<P>
<LI>The warranty under subsection (a) does not apply:<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>to information or data publicly available in Patent Office or similar public records of which the transferee has knowledge;<P>
<LI>if the information is merely incidental to the transfer of rights and does not constitute a material portion of the value in the transaction; or<P>
<LI>to a licensor with reference to information or other intangibles prepared or created by a third party if the licensor merely makes available the intangibles in a form that identifies them as being the work product of the third party.<P>
</OL>
</OL>
<H2>PROPOSED SECTION 2-2224. WARRANTY OF FITNESS; SYSTEM INTEGRATION</H2>
<OL>
<LI>In a software contract in which a computer program is to be developed, designed, selected, compiled, manufactured, or substantially modified for the transaction and the licensor has reason to know that the licensee is relying on the expertise of the licensor to develop or select appropriate software, the licensor warrants that it will use reasonable care and workmanlike effort to complete its performance in a manner that will achieve the licensee's objectives and purposes as communicated or known to the licensor.<P>
<LI>In contracts governed by subsection (a), there is a warranty that the transferor will produce a product of quality and performance suitable for the transferee's particular purposes in the following circumstances:<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>the contract of the parties so provides; or<P>
<LI>from all the circumstances and actions of the parties, it appears that the licensor agreed to not be compensated for its work unless or unless or until the intangibles were fit for the purposes to which the licensee intended to put them.<P>
</OL>
<LI>If the agreement of the parties requires that the licensor provide goods and computer software to form elements of a single or integrated system, and the circumstances indicate that the licensee is relying on the expertise of the licensor to select or develop the goods or software there is a warranty that the units selected or developed if delivered in proper condition will function together as a system consistent with the goals of the licensee known or communicated to the licensor.  This warranty is not made by a consultant who advises on the selection or development of the system, but does not itself sell or license any of the goods or software.<P>
<LI>This section applies whether or not the intangibles contract includes a transfer of goods or other means, physical or otherwise, of using the intangibles without substantial additional manufacturing, development, analysis, or other work by the licensee.<P>

<H2>GATT UPDATES</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
<H2>GENERAL</H2>
<UL>
<LI>GATT is a worldwide agreement covering multiple facets of international trade.  The new body overseeing trade is the World Trade Organization (WTO).<P>
<LI>The latest revisions to GATT are known as the Uruguay Round.  The Uruguay Round includes many sets of Codes dealing with different trade aspects.<P>
<LI>GATT can only be accepted as a package - countries cannot accept only select Uruguay Round Codes.<P>
<LI>The Uruguay Round negotiations on the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights resulted in the TRIPS Agreement.  This agreement, which establishes international property rights (IPR) standards and strong enforcement measures, covers seven areas:<P>
<OL>
<LI>copyrights<P>
<LI>patents<P>
<LI>trademarks<P>
<LI>industrial designs<P>
<LI>trade secrets (undisclosed information)<P>
<LI>integrated secrets (semiconductor chip mask works)<P>
<LI>geographical indications
</OL>
</UL>
<H2>LEVEL OF PROTECTION</H2>
<UL>
<LI>While strengthening many of the current worldwide intellectual property standards, the TRIPS provisions still provide a minimal level of protection.<P>
<LI>In order to gain more effective protection, the United States is continuing to negotiate bilateral agreements with many countries.
</UL>
<H2>BASIC REQUIREMENTS - 3 PRONGS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>National Treatment:  Each country must treat foreigners on same basis as its own nationals.<P>
<LI>Most Favored Nation ("MFN") Treatment<P>
<OL>
<LI>Any advantage afforded nationals of one member country must be given to nationals of all member countries.<P>
<LI>The MFN requirement will effectively extend grace period provided under the Paris Convention to all TRIPS member countries which have a treaty providing for a grace period with at least one other TRIPS member country.<P>
</OL>
<LI>Minimum standards:  TRIPS goes beyond trade related aspects of intellectual property.  It requires that each member country adopt intellectual property laws meeting minimum standards.
</UL>
<H2>IMPLEMENTATION</H2>
<UL>
<LI>National treatment and MFN treatment<P>
<OL>
<LI>These provisions take effect immediately.<P>
</OL>
<LI>Implementation depends on the industrial level of the country:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Developed countries have one year;<P>
<LI>Developing countries and countries which are being transformed from a centrally planned economy into a market economy have five years; and<P>
<LI>Least developed countries have ten years.<P>
</OL>
<LI>There are no definitions of the terms "developed" and "developing."  The United States is attempting, through bilateral negotiations, to hasten the timetable for many countries to enact the TRIPS provisions, including negotiations with China and Taiwan.
</UL>
<H2>HIGHLIGHTS OF TRIPS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Patents<P>
<OL>
<LI>Compulsory licenses<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>The Paris Convention permits nonexclusive compulsory licenses f a patent is not "worked."  In other words, if a patent holder does not industrially use the patent, the government may grant other parties the right to use the patent without the patentee's permission and without compensating the patentee.<P>
<LI>TRIPS also provides for nonexclusive compulsory licenses, but in very limited circumstances.  Compulsory licenses are limited in scope and duration.  TRIPS also requires that the patentee be compensated and provides for judicial review of the grant of the compulsory license and the amount of compensation.<P>
</OL>
<LI>Patent Term:  The Paris Convention does not require a minimum patent term.  TRIPS proposes a 20 year term from the filing date.<P>
<LI>Rights conferred:  The Paris Convention does not specify the rights conferred by a patent.  TRIPS, on the other hand, expressly grants a patentee the rights of excluding others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing infringing products or processes.<P>
<LI>Patentable inventions<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>The Paris Convention does not provide for what subject matter is patentable.<P>
<LI>TRIPS provides that patents will be available for inventions that are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application, with a few exceptions.  Protection is provided for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals.<P>
<LI>Member countries may deny patent protection for inventions for public order, morality, health, or environmental reasons.<P>
</OL>
</OL>
Trademarks<P>
<OL>
<LI>Term<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>Minimum term of seven years.<P>
<LI>The term is renewable.<P>
</OL>
<LI>Cancellation:  A trademark registration may be cancelled if the mark is not used for at least three years.<P>
<LI>Rights conferred:  The owner of a registered trademark has the right to prevent third parties from using a similar mark for goods where such use would result in confusion.<P>
<LI>Extension to service marks:  Service marks as well as trademarks are protected under TRIPS.<P>
<LI>Geographically misdescriptive marks<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>Marks cannot be registered if they falsely designate their geographic origin.<P>
<LI>This provision has a grandfather clause.<P>
</OL>
</OL>
<LI>Copyrights<P>
<OL>
<LI>In general, TRIPS is very similar to the Berne Convention, and generally requires adherence to the Berne Convention.<P>
<LI>The term of protection is 50 years plus the life of the author.<P>
<LI>Original compilations of data are protectable.<P>
<LI>Computer Software<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>TRIPS provides that computer software, in source code and object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention.<P>
<LI>TRIPS is silent on whether computer programs embodied in microelectronic devices are protectable under copyright law.<P>
<LI>TRIPS is silent on reverse engineering.<P>
<LI>TRIPS provides for rental rights.  The copyright holder has the right to authorize or prohibit the commercial rental to the public of original or copies of copyrighted works, as least as to computer programs.<P>
</OL>
<LI>Moral Rights<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>TRIPS does not oblige member nations to enforce the Moral Rights provisions of the Berne Convention.<P>
<LI>This is the major exception to the general statement that TRIPS requires the same level of protection as Berne Convention.<P>
</OL>
<LI>"New" Rights or "New" Beneficiaries.<P>
TRIPS does not require national treatment for any "new" rights or "new" beneficiaries that are not included in existing international copyright conventions, such as levies on the sale of blank tapes to compensate copyright owners for private copying.<P>
</OL>
<LI>Trade Secrets<P>
<OL>
<LI>TRIPS expressly protects "undisclosed information", i.e. trade secrets.<P>
<LI>Member countries must implement laws to prevent the disclosure and use of trade secrets.<P>
<LI>TRIPS requires protection of trade secrets for chemical and pharmaceutical products while they are being submitted to governments for approval.<P>
</OL>
</UL>
<H2>DISPUTE SETTLEMENT</H2>

<LI>The Uruguay round of GATT provides improved dispute settlement provisions.  This contrasts with the weak to non-existent provisions in prior international treaties.
</UL>
<H2>ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS</H2>

<H2>NAFTA UPDATES</H2>
<DL>
<DD>
<H2>HISTORY OF THE NAFTA AGREEMENT</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Negotiations over the NAFTA began in earnest in 1991, and concluded on October 7, 1992.  As of today, Canada, Mexico, and the United States are signatories of the NAFTA treaty.  Negotiations to include other countries, such as Chile, are underway.<P>
<LI>The NAFTA Intellectual Property provisions came into effect on January 1, 1994.  Exceptions are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Border control provisions need not be implemented by Mexico until 1997;<P>
<LI>Protection of semiconductor layout designs need not be implemented in Mexico for four years;<P>
<LI>Protection for encrypted programs had to be implemented by January 1, 1995; and<P>
<LI>Adherence to the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, 1978, or the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, 1991, need not be implemented by Mexico until 1996.<P>
</OL>
</UL>
<H2>CANADA/U.S. FTA</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Prior to signing NAFTA, the United States and Canada had entered into the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement.  This agreement contains very few provisions relating to intellectual property.  However, it does grant Canada's "Cultural Industries" (essentially any form of multimedia) an exclusion with respect to all NAFTA IPR obligations, except those resulting from Canada's adherence to the Berne Convention.
</UL>
<H2>GENERAL</H2>
<UL>
<LI>By the time NAFTA became effective on January 1, 1994, the intellectual property laws of all NAFTA countries had already been amended to be in substantial compliance with NAFTA obligations.<P>
<LI>Enforcement:  Some of the most significant IPR provisions in NAFTA are directed to expedite and assure enforcement.  NAFTA outlines a "Bill of Rights" for parties and sets minimum powers to be wielded by judicial authorities.<P>
<LI>National Treatment:  Each member is required to accord to nationals of another member the same "treatment that it accords its own nationals with regard to the protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights."
</UL>
<H2>PATENTS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>NAFTA mandates the availability of patent protection and effective enforcement.<P>
<LI>Patentability Criteria:  Remains basically the same.  That is, utility, novelty, and non-obviousness.<P>
<LI>Patentable Subject Matter:  Member nations must provide patent protection for an invention, unless the subject matter is immoral, unsafe, or the subject of diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods and procedures.  Plants, pharmaceuticals, and the layout design of integrated circuits must be protected.<P>
<LI>Patent Term:  A minimum term of 17 years from the date of grant or 20 years from the date of filing is required.<P>
<LI>Date of Invention:  Consistent with the national treatment provisions of NAFTA, dates of invention may be established by proof of activities in any NAFTA country.<P>
<LI>Compulsory Licensing:  Member countries may still require compulsory licensing of certain inventions.<P>
<LI>Parallel Importation:  Parallel importation is not mentioned in NAFTA and therefore it remains a question of each member country's national law.  Article 1709(5) authorizes the patent owner to prevent the importation of a product made by a patented process.  A comparable provision does not exist with respect to patented products.
</UL>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Berne Convention:  Each member country must comply with the substantive provisions of the Berne Convention.  However, NAFTA does not require the recognition of the author's moral rights against misattribution, mutilation, or other alteration of a copyrighted work.<P>
<LI>National treatment applies.  However, Canada is allowed to discriminate against other member countries cultural industries based on its cultural industries exception.<P>
<LI>Computer Programs:  NAFTA explicitly protects computer programs as literary works protectable under copyright laws.  Copyright owners are given the right to control the commercial rental of computer programs and sound recordings.<P>
<LI>Satellite Broadcast Signals:  Satellite Broadcast Signals are explicitly protected by NAFTA.<P>
<LI>Work for Hire:  Work for hire agreements are recognized in all NAFTA countries.<P>
<LI>Enforcement:  NAFTA requires the imposition of criminal penalties at least in cases of copyright piracy on a commercial scale.  NAFTA also requires that judicial authorities have the power to prevent the importation of merchandise which infringes copyrights.
</UL>
<H2>TRADEMARKS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Registration:  Each NAFTA country must provide a system for the registration of trademarks.  Actual use cannot be a requirement for filing an application.  Use is required to maintain a registration.<P>
<LI>Famous Marks:  Each member country shall adopt the requirements of the Paris Convention Article 6bis regarding famous marks.<P>
<LI>Term:  Marks are registered for indefinite renewable periods of ten years.<P>
<LI>Compulsory Licensing:  Compulsory Licensing is prohibited.<P>
<LI>Enforcement:  NAFTA requires the imposition of criminal penalties at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting.  NAFTA also requires that judicial authorities have the power to prevent the importation of merchandise which infringes trademarks.  Under NAFTA, judicial authorities in member countries will have the power to dispose of or destroy infringing products.
</UL>
<H2>TRADE SECRETS</H2>
<UL>
<LI>NAFTA requires protection of trade secrets from unauthorized disclosure.  The information to be protected must be (1) secret; (2) have commercial value due to its secrecy; and (3) be protected from unauthorized dissemination by reasonable steps.<P>
<LI>Unauthorized disclosure under NAFTA occurs only when the third party acquires the information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices, and the third party knew or was grossly negligent in failing to know that such practices were involved in the acquisition.
</UL>
</DL>
<H2>MIDDLE EAST UPDATES</H2>
<DL>
<DD>According to estimates by the United States Commerce Department, intellectual property accounts for nearly 25% of U.S. Exports, and this percentage is on the rise.  However, the United States continues to lose billions of dollars in exports because of inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries.<P>
The Arab Gulf states, also known as the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), have been considered a haven for piracy and counterfeiting activities in the Middle East.  Until recently, most of these countries had little if any intellectual property rights laws.  The lack of these laws and the extremely liberal trading policies of these countries have resulted in wide distribution of counterfeit and pirated material throughout the region.<P>
In recent years, however, a number of factors have led to significant changes, not only in the laws, but also in the attitude of the governments regarding intellectual properties.  There is a growing recognition among the GCC Countries that the lack of intellectual property protection is hurting them economically and hampering their technological development efforts.  Many high technology U.S. and European countries have simply stayed away from the region depriving the GCC countries of the latest technological advances in the medical, telecommunication and the computer industries.<P>
Another factor that is changing attitudes toward intellectual property rights is the desire of some GCC countries to join GATT and consequently to comply with GATT's IP provisions.  The U.A.E. joined GATT in March 1994, after having enacted copyright, trademark and patent laws in 1992.<P>
Finally, the United States government continues to exert enormous pressure on the GCC Countries to adopt and implement laws that protect intellectual property rights.  In many instances, the U.S. government has sent teams of experts to work with the various governments in the area on developing mechanisms for stronger enforcement of existing laws.<P>
What follows is a brief outline of the recent developments in trademark and copyright laws in the GCC Countries.
<H2>TRADEMARK</H2>
<UL>
<LI>By 1993, all the GCC Countries have adopted or modified their trademark laws, the U.A.E. being the last one to implement its laws on January 12, 1993.  Most of the trademark laws of these countries have been based on the Model Trademark Law for Arab Countries and therefore contain similar provisions.  They contain, for instance, strong provisions against trademark infringement including fines, jail terms and in some instances the possibility of a civil action against the infringer:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Bahrain:<P>
Legislative Decree No. 10, (1991).<P>
<LI>Kuwait:<P>
Part of the Commercial Code (Book 1, Part III) issued by Decree No. 68 (1980).<P>
<LI>Oman:<P>
Sultanate Decree No. 68/78 (1987) Implementing Regulation:  Ministerial Resolution 103 (1988).<P>
<LI>Qatar:<P>
Law No. 3 (1987) on Commercial Marks and Indications, amended by Law Decrees No. 17 (1987) and No. 37 (1988).<P>
<LI>Saudi Arabia:<P>

<LI>U.A.E.:<P>
Federal Law No. 37 (1992).
</OL>

<H2>COPYRIGHT</H2>
<UL>
<LI>U.S. software publishing and distribution industries lose millions of dollars annually because of piracy in the GCC Countries.  In Kuwait for instance, the piracy rate of computer software was about 98% in 1993 which resulted in an estimated $25.5 [million] loss for these industries.  Similarly, in 1993 Saudi Arabia had a piracy rate of 90% for an estimated loss of $82.3 million, and the U.A.E. had a piracy rate of 99% for estimated losses of $54.5 million.  However, copyright laws have seen the most dramatic changes in the GCC.<P>
<LI>In December of last year, the Saudi government announced that it was acceding to two international conventions on copyright protection, the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention.  Enforcement of these conventions in the Kingdom went into effect in July of this year.  The action of the Saudi government is significant because Saudi Arabia is the first country in the GCC group to join international conventions on the protection of intellectual property rights.  Other GCC Countries are likely to follow in the coming few years.<P>
<LI>As of 1994, the status of copyright laws in the GCC is as follows:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Bahrain:  Decree No. 10 (1993) (No implementing regulations).<P>
<LI>Kuwait:  No Copyright law.<P>
<LI>Oman:  No Copyright law.<P>
<LI>Qatar:  No Copyright law.<P>
<LI>Saudi Arabia:  Copyright Law issued under Ministerial Decision No. 30 (September 25, 1989) Regulation governing the deposit of Copyright Application were issued under Royal Decree No. M/26 (March 11, 1992).<P>
<LI>U.A.E.:  Law No. 40 (1992) and subsequent amendments.

</UL>
<H2>CONTINUING CONCERNS FOR U.S. BUSINESSES</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Despite the recent positive development in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, significant problems remain for U.S. companies doing business in the GCC.  Chief among these problems are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The uncertainty about the new IP laws and the commitment of GCC governments to enforcement of these laws;<P>
<LI>Lack of procedural law;<P>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<basefont size=3>

<H2>Copyright Protection for Computer Software</H2>
<UL>
<LI>United States copyright law expressly provides for the protection of computer software.  This protection prevents someone from making "copies" of another's computer software.<P>
<LI>Under the Copyright Act, copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.<P>
<LI>Copyright protection exists at the moment of creation, and lasts for fifty years after the author's death.  If the work is created anonymously or is a "work for hire," the copyright lasts for 75 years from publication, or one hundred years from creation, whichever expires first.<P>
<LI>The Copyright Act expressly covers computer software.  Court decisions have clarified the Act by determining that the copyright statute extends to source and object code, microcode, applications and operating systems, and code on disk, in RAM or embedded in ROM.<P>
<LI>Registration is not needed to obtain copyright protection, however, copyright registration is highly recommended.  Registration is required before initiating suit and is a prerequisite for awards of statutory damages and attorneys' fees.  In addition, registration provides notice of your rights to others.<P>
<LI>Copyright notice is not needed for copyright protection.  Notice is recommended, however, to ensure international protection, defeat claims of innocent infringement and deter infringement.<P>
<LI>Appropriate Copyright Notice Format:<P>
&copy; YEAR OF CREATION OWNER  All Rights Reserved.<P>
<LI>Scope of protection provided by copyright law is sometimes ambiguous, especially in the computer software area.  There are general rules which help govern the proper scope of protection.<P>
<OL>
<LI>Copyright only covers the expression of ideas.  Ideas themselves are not protected by the Copyright Act.<P>
<LI>Copyright does not extend to elements which are not original to the author.  An author cannot copy elements from another source and then seek to use the copyright laws to prevent the copying of those very elements.<P>
<LI>Copyright does not extend to standard elements (Scènes à Faire).<P>
<LI>The independent creation of an element is a defense to a claim of copyright infringement.  Copyright only prevents copying.<P>
</OL>
<LI>To establish a claim of copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove copying.  Proof of direct copying is the best evidence, but difficult to obtain.  If there is no evidence of direct copying, a plaintiff must prove access to the copyrighted work and that the defendant's work is substantially similar to the plaintiff's copyrighted work.<P>
<LI>Scope of Protection for Computer Programs is generally determined by how courts analyze substantial similarity.  Two tests predominant:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The "Look and Feel" test<P>
<LI>The "Abstraction Test"
</OL>
</UL>
<H2>Utility Patent Protection for Computer Software</H2>
<UL>
<LI>In exchange for an inventor sharing his or her invention with the public, the government may issue a U.S. patent which grants to the patent holder an exclusive right to make, use and sell the invention covered by a patent.<P>
<LI>This exclusive right originally lasted 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent.  However, the duration of a patent will be 20 years from the date of filing after June 8, 1995.<P>
<LI>The scope of protection afforded by a patent are determined by its claims.  Claims are originally drafted by a patent attorney and are often amended during "examination" of the patent application by the U.S. Patent Office.<P>
<LI>To be patentable, an idea must be new, useful and nonobvious.<P>
<LI>To be patentable, an idea must be of a type provided for by the patent statute, i.e. "Statutory Subject Matter."  The statute provides that patents may be granted for "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof."<P>
<LI>What is not patentable?<P>
<OL>
<LI>Pure Mathematical Algorithms.  A mathematical formula or algorithm is analogous to a law of nature which cannot be the subject of a patent.<P>
<LI>Printed Matter.  If the invention relates merely to an arrangement of printed matter, the invention is non-statutory and nonpatentable.<P>
<LI>Method of Doing Business.  A method of doing business may be rejected as non-statutory.  The scope of this non-statutory area is not well defined.<P>
</OL>
<LI>The patent statute does not expressly provide for the patenting of computer software.  As of the early 1970s, it was unclear whether any invention which involved a computer program constituted statutory subject matter.  Courts have subsequently held that some inventions relating to computer software are patentable.  Whether or not an invention relating to computer software constitutes statutory subject matter must therefore be determined on a case by case basis.<P>
<OL>
<LI>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has traditionally used a test know as the Freeman/Walter/Abele test to determine whether claims relating to computer software include statutory subject matter.  This test consists of the following inquiry:<P>

<LI>Is a mathematical algorithm directly or indirectly recited in claims?<P>
<LI>If yes, does the claim as a whole merely recite a mathematical algorithm or a method of calculation?<P>
<LI>If yes, the claim as drafted is not directed to statutory subject matter.<P>
</OL>
<LI>Recently, the Federal Circuit reexamined whether an invention relating to computer software was patentable.  The majority decision in In Re Alapat (Fed. Cir. 1994) held that an invention relating to a system for reducing the aliasing of a wave form that a rasterizer will display on an oscilloscope was statutory subject matter, because the claims were directed at machine-based embodiments of the invention (a rasterizer).

<LI>To avoid the right to decompile software, most software is licensed rather than sold.

<LI>It is not possible to have both patent protection and trade secret protection on a single invention.  When a patent is issued, a complete description of the invention is published making any secret in the invention public knowledge.

It is possible, therefore, to file a patent application on a trade secret and, if the patent claims are rejected, withdraw the application and maintain the invention maintained as a trade secret.

<H2>Background to Trademarks</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Gary Weinstein</h4>
<p>


<font="+2"><b>Overview</b></font><p>


A "trademark" is a word, name, symbol, device or any combination thereof adopted and used (or intended to be adopted and used) by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its goods and to distinguish them from those manufactured and sold by others.  A service mark is similar to a trademark except that it is used in connection with services rather than goods.  (The terms trademark and mark will be used in this memorandum to refer to both trademarks and service marks.)<p>

Marks serve to (i) identify and distinguish the goods or services of one party from the goods or services of another, (ii) signify that all goods or services bearing the mark come from a common source, (iii) signify that all goods or services bearing the mark are of similar quality, and/or (iv) symbolize the goodwill of a business.<p>

<font="+2"><b>Trademark Law and Marketing Concepts</b></font><p>

The overriding principle of trademark law is that trademarks identify goods or services used with a mark as having a common source and therefore being of similar quality.  From a marketing perspective, an effective trademark provides a high level of consumer recognition that the goods or services with which the mark is used are associated with a particular source.  If a mark meets this marketing goal, it is likely that trademark law will afford that mark a high degree of protection.  Whether or not a mark is available for use similarly parallels marketing concepts.  <EM>If consumers currently do not associate a proposed mark with any goods or services that are similar to those with which the proposed mark will be used, it is likely that the proposed mark is available for use.</EM><p>

There is also a complementary policy of preserving for everyone's use those marks which tend to describe the goods or services.  Generally, descriptive terms are treated by the courts as words in the public domain that ought to be available to all competitors, and these descriptive words are regarded as failing to distinguish the goods or services of one party from other similar goods or services.  For example, the word recipes is in the public domain for use in conjunction with cookbooks.  Such a policy makes sense from a marketing standpoint because descriptive marks often serve to identify a class of goods or services rather than a particular source of the goods or services.<p>

<font="+2"><b>Selection of a Mark</b></font><p>

A mark may take substantially any format, so long as the mark is distinctive and capable of identifying and distinguishing goods or services.  By way of illustration, a mark may comprise letters ("GTO"), numbers ("747"), a combination of numbers and letters ("DC10"), a single word ("NUTRASWEET"), abbreviations ("I.B.M."), slogans ("YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS"), a name ("TRUMP PLAZA"), symbols and designs (a fanciful swirl for aspartame), a geometrical shape (Mercedes Benz Star), the design or appearance of a building (white miniature castles), clothing (Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders' uniforms), shape (shape of a Coca-Cola bottle), sounds (NBC chimes), smells (floral aroma) and colors (pink fiberglass insulation).<p>

One limitation on the format of a mark is that a mark may not be functional.  If a proposed mark has a utilitarian purpose in the manufacture or use of the goods on which the proposed mark is used, the proposed mark may not be protectable as a trademark.  Otherwise, an individual could monopolize a particular product under the guise of trademark protection.  For example, the shape of "ROLODEX" brand telephone index cards is unprotectable as a mark because the shape is dictated by the intended use of the cards.<p>

The general rule in the United States is that the first party to adopt and use a mark has the right to exclude another's use of a mark which is likely to cause confusion among an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers as to the source, connection or sponsorship between the goods or services offered under the marks.  In order for there to be a likelihood of confusion, however, other factors need to be examined, such as the differences and similarities between the goods/services, the trade channels and the level of sophistication of consumers.<p>

Marks that are typically found to be confusingly similar are those that are identical, look alike, sound alike or mean the same thing.  For example, the marks "SQUIRT" and "QUIRST" for use in connection with soft drinks likely would be considered to be confusingly similar, because they look and sound alike and are used on similar goods; however, if one of the marks was used with tires, for example, it is unlikely there would be any confusion.<p>

Generally, the geographic scope of protection afforded a mark is limited to those areas where the mark actually is being used.  A notable exception to this rule is for marks registered on the Principal Register (see below), which are deemed to have an effective geographic scope of use of the entire United States.<p>

<font="+2"><b>Strength of a Mark</b></font><p>

The strength of a mark determines, to some degree, the breadth of protection provided by the mark.  Strong marks are given a wide range of protection as to both format variations and variety of products and services which will be deemed confusingly similar.  Conversely, weak marks are given a relatively narrow range of protection as to both format variations and variety of products and services which will be deemed confusingly similar.<p>

The strength of a mark is a function of the ability of the mark to distinguish the goods or services with which it is used.  Initially, a mark's strength is assessed based on whether the mark is categorized as fanciful, arbitrary, suggestive, descriptive or generic.<p>

Fanciful marks include coined words which have been invented for the sole purpose of functioning as a mark.  Examples of fanciful marks include "EXXON", "XEROX" and "KODAK".  Additionally, distinctive designs, symbols or other identifying features may serve as fanciful marks.  Fanciful marks are generally the strongest of all marks.<p>

Arbitrary marks consist of words, names, symbols or designs that have a common use or meaning but which, when used in conjunction with a particular good or service, neither suggest nor describe any aspect of that good or service.  Examples of arbitrary marks include "IVORY" for soap and "NOVA" for a television series.  Arbitrary marks generally are also very strong marks.<p>

Despite the general rule that fanciful and arbitrary marks are strong marks, the strength of any mark may be weakened significantly if the word, name, symbol or design is in common use as a mark in that particular or other related product fields.<p>

Due to marketing forces, a vast majority of proposed marks are either suggestive or descriptive.  Suggestive marks generally are defined as those that suggest some quality or ingredient of the goods or services, while descriptive marks generally are defined as those which describe the intended purpose, function, use or effect of the goods or services, or the class of intended consumers.  A determination of whether a mark is suggestive or descriptive is one of the most difficult issues in trademark law.  Moreover, the protection afforded to a mark can be altered dramatically depending on whether the mark is categorized as suggestive or descriptive.  A mark categorized as suggestive is deemed to be inherently distinctive and therefore capable of functioning as a mark, while <EM>a mark categorized as descriptive is deemed to be inherently indistinctive and therefore incapable of functioning as a mark unless and until secondary meaning can be proven.</EM><p>

Secondary meaning means that, while the mark has a primary meaning that belongs to the public (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the dictionary definition), the mark also has developed a secondary meaning in that purchasers have come to recognize the proposed mark as identifying and distinguishing the goods or services of one party from the goods or services of others.  For instance, the mark "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" has come to be associated with a particular magazine rather than a broad class of illustrated publications about sports.  Developing secondary meaning usually requires significant promotions and/or advertising over an extended period of time (typically several years).<p>

Finally, a mark is generic if it is deemed to be equivalent to the goods or services with which it is used.  For example, "magazine" is generic for publications.  Note, however, that while a mark may be generic (or descriptive or suggestive) for one type of goods or services, that same mark might be arbitrary for the goods or services with which it is used (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the mark "APPLE" is generic for fruit or apples, but not for computers).  <EM>Generic marks are incapable of achieving secondary meaning and therefore cannot function as trademarks or be protected.</EM><P>

<font="+2"><b>Federal Registration</b></font><p>

While trademark protection in the United States begins when a mark is used in connection with the designated goods or services, it is also possible to register a mark.  Registering a mark affords the owner several additional advantages, as will be discussed below.  Despite the advantages afforded by registration, it is important to realize that <EM>in the United States trademark protection comes from usage, not from registration; registration only modifies and expands on those underlying trademark rights</EM> (in many foreign countries, however, this rule is reversed).<p>

In the United States, there are multiple trademark registration schemes, both on the federal level and the state level.  The federal registration scheme is broken down into (i) the Principal Register for marks which either are not descriptive or already have achieved secondary meaning, and (ii) the Supplemental Register for marks which are considered descriptive and have not yet achieved secondary meaning, but which otherwise are capable of functioning as trademarks.  Generic marks are incapable of federal registration.<p>

Before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will register a mark on either the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register, an examining attorney will (i) evaluate the availability of the mark (by searching for and comparing with other federal registrations and applications) and (ii) assess whether the mark is generic, descriptive or otherwise unregistrable.  Applicants are given an opportunity to respond to and contest rejections made by the USPTO.<P>

<font="+2"><b>Incorporation of Stylization or Design</b></font><p>

Even if the textual portion of a mark (known as the block form) is descriptive or generic, it is possible that the mark may be displayed in a particular stylization (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the mark "COCA-COLA" displayed in stylized lettering) or in conjunction with a unique design (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the mark "PEPSI" with the Pepsi logo) so that the mark as a whole is not merely descriptive.  In practice, many marks are used in conjunction with either a particular stylization or design in order to increase consumer recognition of the mark.  This is particularly true when the textual portion of the mark is generic or descriptive.<p>

When registering a mark, it is possible to file an application for the block form (words only) of the mark, an application for the stylized or design form of the mark, or separate applications for each.  While a block form registration generally affords a greater scope of protection than a stylized or design registration, if the text is descriptive or generic, the USPTO most likely will require that any descriptive portions be disclaimed.  Furthermore, if the design or stylization is recognized by consumers, then obtaining a second registration for the design or stylized version is particularly advantageous.  For example, many consumers viewed T-shirts which displayed the words "Enjoy Cocaine" as being associated with or sponsored by the Coca-Cola Company when these words were displayed in the same stylization and coloring as is used for the mark "COCA-COLA".<P>

<font+"+2"><b>Identification of Goods and Services</b></font><p>

One of the required parts of a trademark application is the list of goods and services with which a mark is being used, or in the case of an intent-to-use application (see below), the goods and services with which the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark.  Ideally, this list is broad enough to cover all (intended) uses of the mark, yet sufficiently specific so that anyone reading the list will understand which goods and services are covered.<p>

Goods and services are broken down into various official classes, and the government filing fee for  federal applications is $245 per class.  For intent-to-use applications, the government charges an additional $100 per class upon filing evidence that the mark is being used.  Attached at the end of this memo is a list of the official classes along with a summary description of each class.<p>

Among the considerations that may be taken into account when deciding whether it is worthwhile to include any given class in an application are:  the amount of revenue earned or expected to be earned from goods or services in that class; the importance of maximizing the protection for the mark in that class; and who the competitors are in that class.<p>

As a trademark registration lists specific goods and/or services, when the registrant introduces additional goods and services under that mark, it is important to review the registration(s) and/or application(s) it already has in order to determine whether the new uses are covered or whether an additional application should be filed.<p>

<font+"+2"><b>The Federal Principal Register</b></font><p>

Federal registration of a mark on the Principal Register confers a number of benefits and legal advantages, including:<P>


<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>

<LI>recovery of profits, damages and costs for infringement, possibly including treble damages and attorneys' fees,<br> 
<LI>evidence of the registrant's ownership and exclusive right to use the mark,<br>
<LI>evidence of continuous use of the mark dating back to the filing date of the application,<br>
<LI>evidence that the mark is not confusingly similar to other registered marks,<br>
<LI>evidence that the mark has acquired secondary meaning,<br>
<LI>constructive notice that the mark is being used,<br>
<LI>ability to prevent the importation of goods bearing an infringing mark, and<br>
<LI>an effective geographic scope of use of the entire United States.<br>
</OL>



In addition, after a mark has been in continuous use for five years from the date of registration on the Principal Register, the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark can achieve incontestable status, except for certain limited defenses.<P>

<font="+2"><b>The Supplemental Register</b></font><p>

While a descriptive mark may be usable, it is registrable on the Principal Register only if the mark has achieved secondary meaning.  A mark that is only partially descriptive is registrable on the Principal Register either by disclaiming the descriptive portion or by showing that the mark has achieved secondary meaning (see above).  Marks which are considered descriptive and have not yet achieved secondary meaning, but which otherwise are capable of functioning as a mark, may be registered on the Supplemental Register.<p>

Marks registered on the Supplemental Register do not benefit from many of the advantages available from registration on the Principal Register.  However, registration on the Supplemental Register provides notice to others that the mark is being used, allows the registrant to a place the ® symbol by its mark and prevents others from federally registering similar marks. <EM> A registration on the Supplemental Register does not grant to the registrant any rights to prevent others from using the mark beyond those which are obtained by usage without registration</EM> (known as common law trademark rights).  A registration on the Supplemental Register for a period of five years coupled with continuous and substantially exclusive use of the mark typically is sufficient to show that the mark has achieved secondary meaning, thereby enabling the owner to obtain a registration on the Principal Register.<p>

<font="+2"><b>Intent-to-Use Applications</b></font><p>

Under traditional trademark law, as was discussed previously, rights in a mark are not secured until the mark actually is used in connection with specific goods and/or services.  Often, however, companies begin product development and marketing well in advance of actually offering goods or services under a proposed mark.  As such, substantial time and money may be spent, and goodwill developed, long before the proposed mark is "used" in a trademark sense.<p>

By filing a special type of federal trademark application, called an intent-to-use application, a person or company can reserve a mark for use on designated goods and/or services.  Provided that the intent-to-use application ultimately matures into a registration on the Principal Register, the application will constitute constructive use of the mark and confer nationwide priority as of the filing date of the application.  A promptly filed intent-to-use application reduces the chances that another party will obtain superior rights to use the mark in connection with the specified goods and/or services.<p>

After an intent-to-use application has been approved by the USPTO, the applicant has six months within which to file evidence that the mark is being used in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application.  This term is renewable in six month intervals for $100 per class, for a total of up to three years.<p>

<font="+2"><b>State Registration</b></font><p>

Most states provide for some kind of trademark registration.  Unlike federal registration where the USPTO evaluates the availability of a mark and assesses whether it is descriptive, generic, confusingly similar to other marks or otherwise unregistrable, most states ordinarily do not conduct any meaningful review before registering a mark.  As such, a state registration typically has little offensive legal significance, although it might, depending on the state, serve as evidence that the facts stated in the registration are true and offer other advantages.  <EM>Priority of use, not priority of state registration, controls trademark rights.</EM>  The mere ownership of a state trademark registration does not confer trademark rights absent actual use of the mark.<p>

In many cases, state registration offers little more than a psychologically soothing effect for the registrant.  A state trademark registration (as well as a federal registration or application) may have significant value in that it will likely be found by others who conduct a trademark search and thereby may helpt to prevent reputable businesses from unintentionally adopting and using a similar mark.<P>

<font="+2"><b>Proper Use of a Mark</b></font><p>

Marks must be protected and properly used or they will be lost.  Many marks have passed into the public domain because they were misused.  Some famous former marks which have been lost include "ESCALATOR", "KEROSENE", "SHREDDED WHEAT", "CELLOPHANE" and "ASPIRIN".  A trademark is lost when it becomes generic and is no longer capable of identifying or distinguishing the goods or services of a particular individual.  Some valuable marks, such as "XEROX" and "FEDEX", currently are in danger of becoming generic.  To combat a potential loss of trademark rights, the Xerox Corporation has been running ads for several years in major newspapers telling people that "you can't 'XEROX' a document--you can photocopy it on a 'XEROX' brand copying machine."<p>

It is relatively easy to protect marks.  Proper care and maintenance includes: (i) using the mark in a manner which distinguishes it from the surrounding text (capitalization or quotation marks), (ii) using a trademark notice following the mark (® for federally registered marks and <sup><font="=1">tm</font></sup> for all others), and (iii) using the common descriptive name of the product after the mark ("BAND-AID"® brand adhesive bandages).  Marks should not be used in the possessive form ("PAMPER's" disposable diapers), in the plural form (a 6-pack of "COKES"), as a verb ("XEROX" this report), or as a noun (pick up some "WHEATIES").  <EM>Marks are adjectives and should be used as such.</EM><p>

<font="+2"><b>Licensing</b></font><p>

One of the primary functions of a mark is to indicate quality.  Consumers expect all goods and/or services bearing the same mark to be of comparable quality.  Hence, a trademark license should include not only a provision allowing the licensee to use the mark, but also a provision providing the licensor with sufficient quality control measures.  The licensor must be able to insure that the goods and/or services sold by the licensee under the licensed mark are of quality comparable to the quality of goods and/or services offered by the licensor (and/or other licensees) under that same mark.<P>

<H2>Has the Patent Wolf Swallowed the Trade Dress Sheep?</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>John M. Haurykiewicz</h4>
<p>


<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Courts of Appeal for the 7th and 10th Circuits have put a new spin on an arcane corner of intellectual property law, but one which all intellectual property owners should consider when making decisions about what species of intellectual property they select to protect their products or services:  The overlap of patents and trade dress.<P>

Utility patents protect the underlying idea and design patents protect the ornamental appearance of new, useful, and unobvious inventions.  Trademarks are used to indicate the source or origin of a product.  Trade dress is the overall image used to present a product to potential purchasers.  Patents have a limited life (previously 17 years, but for newly filed utility applications, 20 years from the date of filing of the application).  Design patents expire 14 years after issue.  Once a patent expires, the subject matter of the patent is to be freely available for use by anyone.  In contrast, trademarks and trade dress have potentially unlimited lifetimes, provided that use of the mark or trade dress continues in the marketplace.<P>

What happens after the expiration of a patent when trade dress features are claimed in the patent?  The 10th Circuit case of Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. v. Duracraft Corp., 58 F.3d 1498, 35 U.S.P.Q.2d 1332 (10th Cir. 1995) holds that where a disputed product configuration is part of a claim in a utility patent, and the configuration is a described, significant, and inventive aspect of the invention, see 35 USC §112, so that without it the invention could not fairly be said to be the same invention, patent law prevents its protection as trade dress, even if the configuration is non-functional.<P>

In this situation Vornado included a spiral grill structure as an element in the claims of its fan patent.  A competitor, Duracraft, offered an inexpensive look-a-like product which did not infringe the Vornado patent.  Vornado then turned to Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and alleged trade dress infringement because the appearance of the Vornado and Duracraft products shared the spiral grill appearance.<P>

In order to prevail in its trade dress infringement case, Vornado needed to show that the product's trade dress was inherently distinctive or that it had become distinctive through acquisition of secondary meaning, thus demonstrating that the trade dress had a source identifying meaning.<SUPER>1</SUPER>  In addition, Vornado needed to show that potential customers were likely to be confused by Duracraft's trade dress into thinking that Duracraft was affiliated, associated, or acting with the approval of Vornado.<P>

Duracraft defended by alleging that the contested trade dress was functional and, therefore, all competitors were permitted to copy it regardless of the source identifying attribute.  Functionality, in this context, has a special meaning: If competitors need to be able to use a particular configuration in order to make an equally competitive product, it is functional, but if they do not, it may be non-functional.  Vornado, supra.  In other words, functionality is not to be equated with usefulness.  The Court decided that because Vornado included the spiral grill in its patent claims, Vornado could not also use a trade dress theory, because that would prevent people from fully exploiting the patented invention after the patent expires.  <P>

What happens when trade dress features are disclosed, but not claimed, in a patent and the patent expires?  The 7th Circuit in the case of Thomas & Betts Corp. v. Panduit Corp., 65 F.3d 654, 36 U.S.P.Q.2d 1065, (7th Cir. 1995) was faced with that issue, but found that the feature of an oval head for electrical cable ties had not acquired secondary meaning and hence was free to be copied once the patent covering the cable tie expired.  In this situation, the oval head was disclosed but not claimed in the patent.  The patent was directed to a cable tie having a metal barb in the head which retained the tail of the tie once inserted into the head.  No specific configuration was claimed for the head.  The 7th Circuit stated:<P>

<blockquote><EM>Copying is not only good, it is a federal right--a necessary complement to the patent system's grant of limited monopolies..... The right to copy is even more robust when the copied product was previously patented but the original patent has expired.</EM></blockquote><P>

The court went on to say [t]he issue is not the primary meaning to consumers of a particular signifier, but is instead whether a product feature's primary significance to consumers is as an identifier of source or as an element which contributes to the inherent appeal of the product.  The 7th Circuit considered the Vornado decision, but indicated that [t]he focus on what is or is not claimed is misguided... and as much as said that the entire invention as disclosed is dedicated to the public upon expiration of the patent.  Notwithstanding this strong language regarding the consequences of patent expiration, the court based its decision on the failure of the plaintiff to demonstrate secondary meaning in the oval head.  One of the most telling points considered by the court in deciding there was no secondary meaning was that the plaintiff's advertising failed to encourage consumers to identify the particular trade dress feature with the plaintiff (e.g., look for the oval head).  Instead, the court found that the plaintiff's advertising promoted the particular feature as having desirable aspects of the product itself (low profile rounded head...won't snag...smooth body prevents breakage problems).  <P>

The Vornado and Thomas & Betts cases are consistent with other, non-patent related cases.  For example, in another recent case, Fabrication Enterprises, Inc. v. Hygenic Corporation, 64 F.3d 53, 35 U.S.P.Q.2d 1753 (2nd Cir. 1995) the Court addressed the issue of whether a color-coding system to indicate resistance levels of elastic bands used in physical rehabilitation was protectable under the Lanham Act.  The Court referred to three factors that must be considered:<P>

<OL>
<LI>The degree of functionality of similar features of the product,
<LI>The degree of similarity between the non-functional (ornamental) features of the competing products, and
<LI>The feasibility of alternative designs that would not impair the utility of the product.

</OL>

These factors must be considered by the courts to assess how application of Lanham Act protection to useful features may affect competition.  The 2nd Circuit remanded this case to the trial court for a full trial on the merits.  Although not a case where patents overlap trade dress, the Fabrication Enterprises case shows that the courts will weigh the potential competitive impact of extending Lanham Act protection to product features or designs embodied in trade dress.  Such an ad hoc approach makes it difficult to predict, at the time a potentially infringing product is introduced, how a court will view the competitive impact retrospectively.  Where a utility patent is involved, at least the 10th Circuit has indicated that the patent preempts any trade dress protection in patented elements of the product.  The Vornado case, while not directly addressing design patents, appears to be available as precedent for the proposition that filing a design patent is an election of protection preempting protection via trade dress for the product shown in the design patent.  <P>

In conclusion, both utility and design patent applicants should weigh functionality and the preemption of the patent protection over trade dress protection in deciding what features to include in the specification, drawings and claims of patent applications that may include ornamental elements of their products.  Competitors looking to copy product designs from expired patents can take comfort in the recent case developments, but should always investigate whether the patent owner has made efforts to build secondary meaning (and what the success of those efforts has been) in product features sought to be copied.<P>

<H2>White House to Ease Controls on Encryption Software</H2>



<H4>by</h4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_mpls.html#sako">Richard Y. Sako</a></H4>

In an apparent compromise to the ongoing debate between the U.S. computer industry and U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies over export restrictions on encryption software products, on October 1, 1996, the Clinton Administration announced its new policy on data encryption exports which will permit U.S. companies to export more powerful forms of encryption software subject to certain conditions.
<p>

Encryption software, <EM>i.e.</EM>, software capable of scrambling information generated by such software to maintain its secrecy against unintended recipients, is subject to strict regulation restricting the export of such software from the United States to foreign countries.  
Export controls on cryptographic products have been the subject of intense debates between the computer industry and U.S. governmental agencies.  Computer companies argue that strict export controls place the American computer industry at a severe disadvantage in competing in foreign markets as U.S. companies are forced to sell products with inferior capabilities to those sold by their foreign competitors.  Law enforcement agencies counter that strict controls are necessary to ensure that cryptographic technology does not fall into the hands of foreign terrorists, drug cartels and other criminals for use in hiding transactions and communications.  
<p>

Currently, the export of most encryption software is regulated by the U.S. State Department as a "munition" under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), rather than the U.S. Department of Commerce which regulates the export of products having both a commercial and potential military application (see, <EM>International Law Notes</EM>, Spring 1996).  State Department approval is usually required before any item subject to ITAR can be exported.  In most cases, it is extremely difficult to export a munition subject to ITAR, whereas a product under Commerce Department jurisdiction may usually be exported, albeit with some restrictions.  
<p>

Exporters of encryption software presently have three ways in which they can attempt to have control over the export of their product transferred from the State Department to the more lenient Commerce Department.  First, subject to certain restrictions, encryption software which is being exported for personal use by an exporter may qualify for ITARs personal-use exemption.  Second, an exporter may file a request for Commodity Jurisdiction with the State Department pursuant to provisions in ITAR providing for the automatic transfer of jurisdiction over specific types of encryption software from the State Department to the Commerce Department.  For example, software specifically designed and developed for use only in machines for banking or money transactions will be subject to regulation by the Commerce Department.  Third, an exporter may apply to the State Department for transfer of jurisdiction over its product to the Commerce Department on a case-by-case basis.  ITAR provides for the transfer to the Commerce Department for certain mass-market software products which have limited data encryption capabilities.  Under current policy, case-by-case basis transfer of jurisdiction over encryption software products is limited to 40-bit encryption systems.
<p>

Under the new policy, which will become effective January 1, 1997, the Clinton Administration proposes a two-year window during which companies may export more complex 56-bit DES or equivalent data encryption products, including both hardware and software, provided that the companies commit to benchmarks and milestones for developing a key recovery system within such two-year period.  The key recovery system would enable intelligence officials and law-enforcement agents, armed with court warrants, to obtain the mathematical key to decode scrambled communications.  After the two-year period, the export of 56-bit encryption products that do not support key recovery will no longer be permitted.  
<p>

The new policy differs from the past administration proposal calling for a "key escrow" system in which the U.S. government would have been the repository of the numeric keys.  The key escrow system proposal raised fears of potential government abuse as well as concerns that legitimate foreign users would be reluctant to purchase software if its privacy capability could be compromised by U.S. government officials.  Under the new policy, decryption keys may be held by third-party companies.  A key could be divided across several companies that would handle any given message.  Thus, if an intelligence agency obtained a warrant to decode a message, the agency would have to go to several different groups with its warrant to decode the message.
The new policy also proposes that jurisdiction over exports of encryption software be transferred from the State Department to the Commerce Department.  Such a move is seen as a positive step by the computer industry as it is widely believed that the business-friendly Commerce Department will be more receptive in addressing American companies competitive interests.
<p>

Computer industry representatives, while acknowledging that the new policy is a significant step toward addressing their concerns, are reacting to the announcement with cautious optimism.  Representatives state that it will be difficult to market and sell encryption software to foreign customers if it is known that U.S. governmental intelligence agencies will have access to the codes for such products and that further liberalization will be necessary as customer demand for stronger encryption products increases.  A number of issues also remain unresolved including the definition of a key recovery system.
<p>

The success of the new policy is viewed as being dependent in part on the cooperation of foreign countries in assisting U.S. exporters with developing the infrastructure necessary to implement a key recovery system.  President Clinton is expected to sign an Executive Order during October of 1996 to make the new policy official.

<H2>The Foreign Sales Corporation:  A Tax Incentive For Exporters</H2>

<H4>By</h4>
<h4><a href="../offices/att_mpls.html#murphy">Michael E. Murphy</a></H4>

Small and mid-sized exporters that were founded after 1985 are often unaware of a tax exemption available to them under the foreign sales corporation ("FSC") provisions contained in Sections 921-927 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code").  The FSC provisions, enacted in 1985, are intended to encourage the export of U.S.-made goods.  The exemption also applies to architectural and construction services provided to overseas projects by U.S. persons.
<p>

<strong>Definition of an FSC</strong><br>

The FSC is a corporation organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction must be one that allows the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") access to records of the corporation; such records must be kept in the jurisdiction that relate to the corporations liability for U.S. taxes.  A list of eligible foreign jurisdictions appears on page 8.
An FSC is required to have a foreign office where it must keep certain records  including basic financial information and export sales invoices.  At least one member of the FSCs board of directors must reside abroad.  Somewhat surprisingly, the FSCs foreign office need not be in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, nor is it necessary that the foreign resident director (who may be American) reside in the jurisdiction of the FSCs incorporation.  (Lawyers in Faegre & Bensons foreign offices have served as off-shore FSC directors as an accommodation to some of our clients.)
<P>

The FSC statute prohibits an FSC from having more than 25 shareholders.  Finally, the FSC may not issue preferred stock.  The FSC and its shareholders must make an election with the IRS within 90 days before the beginning of the taxable year for which the FSC intends to have its election effective; a newly incorporated FSC may make its election within 90 days after incorporation.
<p>

<strong>Foreign Management and Foreign Economic 
Process Tests</strong><br>

Unless an FSC qualifies and elects to be treated as a "small FSC" (see below), it must meet the "foreign management test" and the "foreign economic processes test" to benefit from the statutory exemption.
<P>

Under the foreign management test, the FSC must (i) hold each shareholders and board of directors meetings outside the United States, (ii) maintain its principal bank account outside the United States, and (iii) pay certain expenditures from bank accounts maintained outside the United States (accounts in foreign branches of U.S. banks will qualify).
<P>

The foreign economic processes test consists of two distinct tests.  First, certain sales-related activities must occur outside the United States.  Second, certain percentages of costs associated with entering into export contracts and delivering goods must be incurred outside the United States and be borne by the FSC.
<P>

The sales-related activities associated with entering into export contracts include (i) the solicitation, (ii) the negotiation, and (iii) "the making of the contract relating to [the export] transaction."  The FSC (or any person acting under contract with the FSC) must have participated outside the United States in at least one of these three sales-related activities.
The statutory cost categories associated with marketing and delivering goods for export include (i) advertising and sales promotion, (ii) processing customer orders and arranging for delivery of the export property, (iii) transporting goods to the customer, (iv) determining and transmitting a final invoice or statement of account and the receipt of payment, and (v) assuming credit risk.  The FSC (or another person acting under contract with the FSC) must incur at least 50% of the total of these costs outside the United States to satisfy the foreign economic processes test.  Alternatively, the FSC can satisfy the test if it can show that 85% or more of the total costs incurred outside the United States were attributable to any two of the five categories.  If  export-related costs are incurred by the exporter in connection with one or more of the five statutory cost categories, then the alternative 50%-85% rules need only be applied to those categories.
<p>

<strong>Illustration of the Foreign Economic Processes Test</strong><br>

Since the foreign economic processes test can be difficult to understand, the following example is offered to illustrate its application in a typical situation.
<P>

Assume that Intertec Inc. is a U.S. manufacturing company that has an independent sales and service representative based in Canada.  The representative is responsible for identifying Canadian customers for Intertec, arranging for and facilitating sales, and servicing Intertecs customers.  The representatives services include relaying pricing and delivery terms from Intertec to its customers, and in turn relaying purchase orders from the customers to Intertec.  Intertec sells its products F.O.B. Minnesota, against irrevocable, documentary letters of credit.
Pursuant to the terms of a contract with Intertec, the representative arranges for Intertec ads to be placed periodically in selected industry publications distributed in Canada, and demonstrates Intertecs products at one industry trade fair in Canada each year.  This is the only investment Intertec makes in advertising and sales promotion targeted to this market.
Intertec compensates its Canadian representative with commissions based on a percentage of sales attributable to the representatives efforts plus costs and expenses incurred by the representative.
<P>

Intertec has organized an FSC and contracted with the FSC to act as Intertecs export agent.  The contract provides that Intertec will perform for the FSC all of the statutory economic process activities.  It also provides that the FSC bear all expenses related to such activities, and requires that such expenses be incurred abroad to the extent of the alternative 50%-85% statutory cost rules.  The contract permits Intertec to subcontract for the statutory economic processes activities, which Intertec does through its agreement with its Canadian representative.
<P>

Since all foreign targeted advertising and sales promotion take place outside the United States, this entire category of expenses can be considered incurred outside the United States.   Treasury Regulations provide that "processing of customer orders" means notifying the related supplier (Intertec) of the order and the requirements for delivery of the export property.  The Regulations further provide that an FSC will be considered to have arranged for product delivery if the FSC or its agent notifies the buyer of the time and place of delivery.  Assuming that these notifications are initiated outside the United States, it would appear that 100% of the category of expenses relating to the processing of customer orders and arranging for delivery of the goods may be considered incurred outside the United States.  Because more than 85% of the costs in two of the five expense categories described above were incurred abroad, Intertec would have met the foreign cost part of the foreign economic processes test.
<P>

Because Intertecs foreign customers bear all costs associated with the transportation of the goods, and because the goods are paid for with an irrevocable letter of credit as they leave Intertecs U.S. facilities, there would be no actual transportation or credit costs associated with Intertecs export sales.  Therefore, these cost categories need not be taken into account for purposes of the 50%-85% cost rules in this example.  Intertecs Canadian representative is not involved in any activities relating to the determination and transmittal of final invoices and receipt of customer payments.  Therefore, none of the expenses associated with this category are incurred outside the United States.  It would therefore appear likely that the 50% rule would also have been met in Intertecs case.
<P>

In relaying pricing and order information, Intertecs foreign representative has participated outside the United States in at least the solicitation and negotiation of the export contracts for Intertec, thus meeting the sales-related part of the foreign economic processes test.  Because the 85% rule was certainly met with respect to the foreign cost part of the foreign economic processes test, Intertec appears to have met the entire foreign economic processes test.
<p>

<strong>Figuring the FSCs Tax-Exempt Income</strong><br>

The amount of income which an FSC can shelter from federal taxation is determined first by totalling an FSCs "foreign trading gross receipts," which are gross receipts attributable to the sale or lease of "export property."  The FSC statute defines "export property" as property produced in the United States and sold or leased to customers outside the United States.  Income from services that are "related and subsidiary" to such sales and leases is included as is income from engineering or architectural services rendered for overseas construction projects.  Income from certain managerial services provided to an unrelated FSC can also be included, but only if the FSC providing such managerial services earns at least 50% of its gross receipts from the sale or lease of export property.
<p>

An FSC may earn foreign trading gross receipts by purchasing export property from related or unrelated U.S. suppliers for resale abroad, or it may earn such receipts in the form of commissions paid to it by U.S. producers on whose behalf the FSC contracts to act as an export marketing agent.  The vast majority of FSCs are involved only with their parent companies products.  They generally operate as commission agents for their parent companies, because the commission arrangement is less difficult to set up and maintain than a title transfer arrangement.
<p>

The FSC may earn its income from the export sales of its parent company either on an "arms-length" basis or on the basis of either of two "administrative pricing" rules.  Transactions between related entities are normally subject to IRS scrutiny under the reallocation rules of section 482 of the Code.  However, since the administrative pricing rules insulate FSC transactions from section 482 review, FSCs and their parent companies usually take advantage of the safe harbors provided by the two administrative pricing rules.
<p>

Under one of the administrative pricing rules, the FSC is entitled to earn 1.83% of the foreign trading gross receipts derived from export sales transactions.  Alternatively, the FSC may earn 23% of the combined taxable income of the FSC and its parent attributable to the export sales.  The FSC may apply whichever rule produces the greater amount of income.
<p>

In order for an FSC to take advantage of the administrative pricing rules, it must have performed all of the economic processes activities described above, insofar as such activities are attributable to the export transaction.   However, for purposes of this requirement, the activities may be performed either within or outside the United States, and they may be performed for the FSC under contract with its parent company (or another person).
<p>

To illustrate the application of the two administrative pricing rules, assume that Intertec manufactures and sells its product to a foreign customer at a price of $1,000, realizing taxable income (without regard to FSC benefits) of $100.  Application of the 1.83% of gross receipts rule would yield income to the FSC of $18.30 ($1,000 x 1.83%).  Application of the 23% of combined taxable income rule would yield FSC income of $23 ($100 x 23%).  Because it yields more income, the 23% of combined taxable income formula would be chosen in this case.
<p>

Once its "foreign trade income" is determined by application of the pricing rules described above, an FSC is entitled to treat a portion thereof as "exempt foreign trade income."  The portion exempted will depend on whether the FSCs foreign trade income resulted from the application of the "arms-length" rule or one of the administrative pricing rules.  In the case of foreign trade income determined by application of either of the administrative pricing rules, 15/23rds of the FSCs foreign trade income is exempt for FSCs with corporate shareholders (or 16/23rds, for FSCs with individual shareholders).
<p>

In the example given above, Intertecs tax exempt income will be 15/23rd of $23, or $15.  Thus, Intertec will have reduced its taxable income on the $1,000 export sale from $100 to $85 by using an FSC.  The $85 will be subject to current U.S. taxation at ordinary rates, but dividends from the FSC to its parent company will be entitled to the intercorporate dividends received deduction under section 245 of the Code.  Therefore, by using an FSC, Intertec will have reduced its effective tax rate on export income from 34% to about 29%.
<p>

<strong>Small FSCs</strong><br>

Companies with export sales of $5,000,000 or less will want to consider electing "small FSC" status.  If an FSC elects to be treated as a small FSC, it will not be required to meet either the foreign management or the foreign economic processes tests; nevertheless it will be eligible for the full statutory exemption with respect to $5,000,000 in gross export receipts.  However, a small FSC is not exempt from the minimal requirements that it have a foreign office and a foreign resident board member.
<p>

<strong>The Shared FSC</strong><br>

The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 amended the FSC provisions of the Code to recognize a so-called "shared FSC."  A shared FSC is one with several unrelated stockholders who use the same FSC vehicle.  By sharing the start-up and maintenance expenses of an FSC, smaller exporters should be able to begin enjoying FSC benefits at an earlier stage of development of their export sales, and all members of a shared FSC should be able to improve their FSC benefits in proportion to the number of shareholders over which FSC costs can be spread.
<p>

<strong>Popular FSC Jurisdictions</strong><br>

Those U.S. possessions that are eligible jurisdictions for FSC purposes have adopted special legislation to accommodate FSCs.  It may be useful to compare legislation enacted in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, the two jurisdictions in which most of our FSC clients have preferred to be organized.
<p>

In lieu of the regular corporate income tax applicable in the Virgin Islands, legislation enacted there imposes a "franchise tax".  For small FSCs, the franchise tax will be either $400 per year (for FSCs with gross receipts under $2,000,000) or $900 per year (for FSCs with gross receipts between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000).  For all other FSCs, the franchise tax will range from $1,000 (for FSCs with gross receipts up to $10,000,000) to $25,000 (for FSCs with gross receipts in excess of $500,000,000).  An FSC may credit against the franchise tax a portion of the wages it pays directly (or indirectly, through a local FSC management firm) to Virgin Island residents.
Guams parallel FSC legislation provides for a flat franchise charge of $400 per year for small FSCs and $1,000 for other FSCs.  Like the Virgin Islands, Guam exempts all foreign trade income of FSCs from corporate income taxation.
<p>

The business corporation laws of the Virgin Islands and Guam are based on U.S. statutory and case law, and their income tax laws mirror the Code.  Therefore, U.S. exporters should be able to use domestic U.S. counsel in connection with the organization and maintenance of FSCs in these jurisdictions.
<p>

By channeling export sales through an FSC, U.S. companies can reduce their federal taxes on income from such sales by about 5%.  Many smaller and mid-sized companies have discovered that it pays to use an FSC when export sales approach  $1,000,000 .

<H2>Labor Law Aspects of Acquisitions in Germany 
and the European Union</H2>



<H4>by</h4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_frnk.html#hummel">Ralph W. Hummel</a></H4>

One of the key aspects of a corporate acquisition is often the transfer of employees.  Invariably, a buyer will not wish to retain every employee of the target company; instead, it will want to replace some of the target companys employees with its own or try to increase the targets efficiency simply by terminating some employees.
<p>

Unlike in the United States, where a seller will typically terminate each employee involved in an acquisition and have the buyer offer new terms of employment to each employee it wishes to retain, German employees (or, for that matter, employees in the European Union) are offered statutory protection during an acquisition.  This should not come as a surprise as Germanys highly valued labor laws traditionally protect employees to a greater extent than U.S. labor laws.
<p>

<strong>Acquisitions in Germany</strong><br>
A general tenet of German labor law is that a buyer of a German corporation must retain all employees under the same or similar working conditions as prior to the acquisition.
Although the identity of the shareholders will change upon a stock acquisition, the relationship between the company and the employees remains unchanged.  A change in shareholders is not sufficient cause for terminating employees.  Employees may not be terminated unless for cause directly attributable to the employee or for a legitimate business reason, e.g., decrease in sales, financial difficulties.
<P>

If a buyer purchases all, or substantially all, of the assets and liabilities of a business,  employees must rely on statutory law for protection since their employment  status does change with the sale of the assets.  Section 613(a) of the German Civil Code states that all rights and obligations regarding employees are transferred if (i) a business, or part of a business (ii) is transferred by agreement (rather than by statute) (iii) to a new owner.
<P>

Not surprisingly, "part of a business" includes divisions of a larger corporate entity.  However, units which are not necessarily thought of as independent, such as sales offices, printing facilities of publishers or repair departments of transportation companies, could also fall under this definition.  To extend this point even farther, a bank in Germany had hired a housekeeping crew; to cut down on costs, the bank decided to contract its housekeeping services out.  In a heavily criticized decision, the European Court of Justice applied Section 613(a) to the housekeepers so that neither the bank nor the independent contractor was allowed to terminate the housekeepers because of this "acquisition."
<P>

If Section 613(a) applies to an acquisition, the buyer must assume all rights and obligations associated with each employee of the target company.  Neither the buyer nor the seller (the previous employer) may terminate an employee solely because of the transfer of  a business.  This prohibition does not extend to employees.  Employees have the right to dissent to the transfer of their employment and to insist on a continuation of their employment with the seller.  The practical implications of this right, however, are clear.  If an employee demands that its employment relationship continue with its former employer, and the former employer no longer operates the business which was the subject of the sale, the employer is suddenly given an obvious and legitimate reason for termination.  The employee would, however, have a right to continued employment with the seller if a suitable position was available in another department of the sellers business.
<P>

Though there is no statutory period by which an employee must voice its dissent, German courts generally require employees to lodge their dissent within two weeks of receiving complete information regarding the transfer.
<P>

Section 613(a) also states that all collective bargaining agreements and agreements between employee representatives (commonly known as works councils) and employers shall remain valid for one year after the transfer of a business and cannot be revised to the employees detriment during that period.
<P>

Regardless, it is not at all rare that buyers will terminate some of the target companys employees.  The reason for the termination will dictate what path the buyer will follow to execute the termination.  If the buyer has a legitimate reason, as defined under German law, it may be required to do nothing more than give termination notices and observe the relavant notice periods.  If a legitimate reason is not available, employers often find severance packages to be an agreeable option for terminating employees.  The legitimacy of a termination is usually first subject to the review of the works council, and if necessary, the regional Department of Labor or a Labor Court.
<P>

Much to the surprise  and often delight  of many, service agreements with Managing Directors (Geschäftsführer) do not fall under the auspices of Section 613(a); thus buyers are not required to retain the sellers Managing Director.  Instead, the terms of an individual agreement between the Managing Director and the company generally govern their relationship.  Since Section 613(a) does not apply to Managing Directors, buyers may terminate them at will.  Of course, since Managing Directors nearly always have a written service agreement, buyers must take care not to breach this agreement upon termination.  Further, Managing Directors are often entitled to generous severance payments upon termination unless the termination is for cause.  
Sometimes overlooked or misunderstood is that a company may terminate a Managing Directors appointment as such  at any time.  Though this will not terminate the Managing Directors employment relationship with a company, it will allow a company to take away the reigns to the day-to-day-affairs of the company over which the Managing Director presided.
<p>

<strong>Acquisitions in the European Union</strong><br>
Buyers should be aware that the EC Commission passed a directive in 1977 which required member states to pass "safeguards" to protect employees rights similarly to Section 613(a).  As stated in that directive "[t]he transfer of a business shall not in itself constitute grounds for dismissal by the transferor or the transferee."
<P>

As one of the enunciated safeguards, employers must notify works councils of a pending acquisition "in good time" before the closing.  As discussed above, works councils have the right to review (i) the reasons for the acquisition, (ii) the legal, economic and social implications of the acquisition, and (iii) "measures envisaged in relation to the employees."
Although the Council Directive on the Establishment of a European Works Council (the "1996 directive"), which member states were to enact into their respective national laws by September 22, 1996, does not apply specifically to acquisitions, its terms must be kept in mind as it does add a twist to the 1977 directive.
<P>

Recognizing that many companies often operate in more than one EU member state, and that the operations in one state can directly impact the employees in another, the 1996 directive requires  management  to establish a so-called European Works Council or an information system in every "community-scale undertaking" i.e., any entity with at least 1,000 employees within the EU and at least 150 employees in each of at least two member states.  There are two significant differences between a European Works Council and a works council in Germany.  First, a works council in Germany is established solely at the initiative of  employees, while the 1996 directive requires management to take the initiative.   Second, while a German works council has the right to participate in a companys decision-making, this same right is not extended to the European Works Council.
<P>

Although many employers will look at this new directive with chagrin, its impact will probably not be great  at least not initially.  First, the threshold in terms of number of employees will allow most employers to ignore the directive.  Second, because most of the companies who are subject to the new directive will already have various works councils in place, they already know how to cooperate effectively with works councils.  Unlike many Americans who instantly become wary of works councils motives, most EU nationals can appreciate the positive aspects of engaging in dialogue with employees. As a result of the 1996 directive, this collaboration will continue, only now on a wider scale.

<H2>Brazil - A Mixed Message for Investors and Traders</H2>




Like many of its South American neighbors, Brazil finds itself at a crossroads with direct foreign investors and foreign traders.  A change in Brazils monetary policy has been the direct cause of bringing the legendary inflation rate under control, lowering tax rates and increasing privatization.  Each of these factors has made Brazil a more attractive site for foreign investors.  However, Brazil has recently shown signs of backing off from its free market stance by increasing duties and imposing import quotas on certain products.  These mixed signals leave outsiders wondering whether Brazil is truly committed to opening its doors to foreigners.
<P>

<strong>Direct Investment</strong><br>

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, often cited as the architect of Brazils change in policy from earlier decades, focused his attention first on Brazils tax rate.  In the past, Brazil restricted foreign direct investment for fear that the country would become dependent on foreign capital which, it was believed, would lead to economic and political instability.  As a result, Brazilian policymakers were able to successfully defend the traditionally high corporate tax rates.  Further, though Brazil was not one of the primary Latin American proponents of the so-called Calvo Clause  a clause formerly in many contracts with foreigners which required foreigners to rely solely on national law when pursuing remedial measures  its use was widespread enough in Latin America to deter foreigners.  Factors such as these allowed Brazil to maintain the "control" over foreigners that domestic businesses, and policymakers, sought.
<p>

Brazils change in policy started to gain acceptance domestically leading eventually to the abolishment of the supplemental tax on dividends in the early 1990s.  Not only did Brazil have some of the highest withholding taxes in the region, but it had also been imposing a supplemental tax on dividends to foreigners to the point where the repatriation of profits was simply not practical.  The decision to reduce taxes on dividends finally culminated in the enactment of Law 9249 on December 26, 1995, which abolished taxes on dividends entirely.  As a result, dividends, or other distributions of profits earned as of January 1, 1996, do not constitute taxable income.
<p>

Brazil also reduced its withholding tax on foreign companies earnings to 15%.  This reduced withholding rate is significant as it is available to all foreign companies, regardless of whether they are citizens of countries which have tax treaties with Brazil as was formerly the case.  The 15% tax applies to earnings from the rental or lease of equipment, capital gains and license fees for technology transfer.  Though the 15% withholding tax initially did not apply to royalties, a provisional decree passed earlier this year specifically includes royalties.
<p>

Finally, the maximum basic corporate income tax has been reduced from 43% to 25%.  Taxable income for income under 240,000 Reals (slightly less than  U.S.$240,000) is in an even lower tax bracket and subject to a maximum income tax of 15%.  Also, the legendary "social contribution on net profits" tax has been reduced from 10% to 8%.  Though this tax is currently deductible, experts speculate that this will not be the case as of 1997.
<p>

Although Law 9249 may cause a companys tax <EM>rate</EM> to be lower, its tax <EM>base</EM> may actually be broadened since the new law may require companies to include their subsidiaries, branches and controlled companies income and capital gains to determine their taxable profit.   Thus Brazil has dramatically changed its tax system from a territorial system to a system which can tax all profits <EM>effectively connected</EM> to the  company.  Nevertheless, proper tax planning allows most companies to minimize this otherwise heavy tax burden.
<p>

Whether this change will motivate Brazil to conclude double taxation treaties with its primary trading partners remains to be seen.  The tax treaty between Brazil and the United States signed in 1967  the first between a South American country and the United States  has, to this day, not been ratified.
<p>

Regardless, estimates provide that direct foreign investment in Brazil will increase from U.S. $3 billion in 1995 to U.S. $5 billion in 1996.  Within the past five years, many U.S.-based franchisors have either initiated or increased their operations in Brazil.  In addition, as recently as October 1, Chrysler and BMW announced that they will form a joint venture company in South America to manufacture 400,000 engines annually.  The companies have narrowed their joint venture site to either Argentina or Brazil.
<p>

<STRONG>Trade</STRONG><br>
Though the policy changes have stirred global interest, Brazil still shows some signs of wavering in its commitment to free trade.  Earlier this year, import quotas and significant tariffs were introduced.  Many argue that these changes should not be seen as evidence of a change in policy as they are nothing more than politicians  including the Trade and Industry Minister  trying to win favors from domestic businesses to gain support for their respective political ambitions.  Whatever the reason, the quotas and increased tariffs have drawn the ire of a few of Brazils trading partners such as the United States, Japan and the European Union.  In fact, the WTO will almost certainly include these oft  labeled "trade barriers" on its agenda in Singapore in December as part of that organizations proceedings regarding free trade with developing countries.
<p>

The quotas and tariffs are generally limited to specific industries  especially hard hit were the motor vehicle, clothing and toy sectors.  Not only is the introduction of these barriers troublesome, but their severity has also been a point of contention.  By way of example, quotas on textiles have caused imports to be cut by more than one-third among Brazils primary textile trading partners.  Brazil had initially set rigid quotas on the motor vehicle industry; these were renounced only after formal proceedings at the WTO.  Further, Brazil introduced a carrot and stick policy by not necessarily imposing stiff tariffs on those motor vehicle companies which demonstrated a commitment to direct foreign investment in Brazil  Mercedes, Toyota and Renault were among the first beneficiaries of this policy.  Regardless, tariffs still flourish in specific industries.  For example, duties on toys increased from 20% to 70% while the wine and footwear industry each experienced increases from 20% to 40%.  
<p>

Whether these barriers are part of a retreat to a protectionist economy or an impulsive reaction to Brazils first trade deficit is not yet known.  Regardless, the strong and widespread reaction from foreign businesses does indicate that foreigners are indeed interested in either entering or expanding their operations in the Brazilian market.

<H2>United Kingdom - Unreasonable Limitation of Liability</H2>

<H4>by</h4>

<h4><a href="../offices/att_lond.html#james">Scott M. James</a></H4>


A recent decision by the English Court of Appeal, <EM>St. Albans City and District Council v.  International Computers Ltd.</EM> (July 26, 1996), highlighted the difficulties in doing business in the United Kingdom when using standard terms and conditions.  The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (the "Act") requires that certain terms in "written terms of business" must satisfy a test of "reasonableness" for such terms to be enforceable.  This standard is lower, and applies more broadly, than the concept of "unconscionability" in Section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
<P>

In the late 1980s, St. Albans City and District Council ("St. Albans") contracted with International Computers Ltd. ("ICL") for the latter to design and implement a database for St. Albans to calculate and assess a local tax on its population.  Program errors in the database led St. Albans to conclude there would be almost 3,000 more community taxpayers than was actually the case.  The result was that St. Albans set the local tax rate too low thereby causing it to suffer a revenue shortfall of £1.3 million (over $2 million).
<p>

The agreement between the parties, an ICL form contract, provided that ICLs liability for loss caused by its performance would be limited to £100,000 (about $156,000).  When St. Albans sued, ICL raised its limitation of liability as a defense.  St. Albans responded that the clause was not enforceable because it failed to satisfy the "reasonableness" requirement in the Act.  Both the trial court and the Court of Appeal found for St. Albans.
<P>

The Acts test of "reasonableness" is a general one: "that the term shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made."  The Act specifies areas of inquiry when looking at the "reasonableness" of a particular contract provision  the relative bargaining positions of the parties, whether the customer received an inducement to agree to the particular term, whether the customer knew, or should have known of the term, and whether the goods were manufactured, processed or adapted to the special order of the customer.
<P>

In making its decision, the trial court took a number of points into consideration including that St. Albans and ICL were two sophisticated organizations and should be free to make their own bargains, that St. Albans was aware of, and understood, the limitation of liability clause, that such clauses were common in the computer industry and that the software was developmental.  (In the American parlance of UCC Section 2-302, the agreement was not unconscionable and was not induced by coercion.)  
<P>

Since the ICL form contract limited the liability of ICL to a specific sum of money, the trial court and the Court of Appeal applied an additional section of the Act to determine whether limiting liability to £100,000 was "reasonable."  Applying this part of the Act, the trial court considered (i) the resources that ICL could have expected to be available to meet the liability it sought to limit and (ii) the viability of insurance to cover the relevant liability.  On these two points, the trial court and the Court of Appeal were impressed that ICL had insurance to cover this type of liability, and that the coverage far exceeded the amount set out in the limitation clause.  The trial court found, and the Court of Appeal affirmed, that the  Act applied to the St. Albans-ICL contract, and that the limitation of liability clause failed to pass a test of "reasonableness."
<P>

Should American businesses selling products in the United Kingdom be concerned with this decision? Perhaps not, since the Act states that international contracts for the sale of <EM>goods</EM> between parties from different countries are not subject to the "reasonableness" requirement.  Thus the answer depends on whether the American supplier is selling directly from the United States or through a U.K. subsidiary.  Only in the former will the "reasonableness" requirements of the Act apply.  
<P>

It is not at all clear, however, whether international service contracts would fall within the reach of the Act.  As to the distinction between "goods" and "services", one of the Court of Appeals judges in <EM>St. Albans</EM> raised a new and controversial issue.  The judge stated that software itself is not "goods", but that it could be "goods" when supplied on tangible medium such as a disk or a CD-ROM.  This analysis would help bring American-supplied software within the "international sale of goods" exception to the Act (and allow U.S. software suppliers to avoid the "reasonableness" test when disclaiming or limiting liability).  
<P>

These aspects of <EM>St. Albans</EM> mean that it will probably be some time, and only after a great deal of discussion, before the full implications of this dramatic development of English law are fully understood.

<H2>IRS Proposes to Ease Rules for Foreign Subsidiaries</H2>



<H4>by Michael E. Murphy and Peter J. Withoff</H4>

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has proposed new regulations which, would ease tax planning for U.S. companies that conduct their overseas operations through foreign subsidiaries organized as limited liability companies.   The new regulations would replace existing regulations that govern the classification of domestic and foreign business entities, including corporations and partnerships.  Final adoption of the regulations is expected before the end of the year.<P>

When U.S. companies establish operations in a foreign country, they usually do so through the vehicle of a locally incorporated foreign company.  Two reasons for doing so include marketing advantages and limitation of liability.  Product or service acceptance in the foreign marketplace is often enhanced when the company presents itself as a locally incorporated entity.  Local incorporation also helps insulate the U.S. parent companys assets from claims arising in connection with the operations of its foreign subsidiary.<P>

However, international tax planning may sometimes indicate the use of a foreign branch of the U.S. parent company or of another U.S. affiliate, rather than a locally incorporated subsidiary.  For example, if foreign start-up losses are anticipated and the U.S. parent company wishes to offset such losses against taxable domestic income, structuring the foreign operation as a branch of the U.S. parent rather than as a separate foreign subsidiary will help, at least temporarily, to achieve this objective. <P>

Another means of permitting tax losses to flow through is to conduct the foreign operations through a local limited liability company whose articles of incorporation are tailored so that the entity will be treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes.  The German Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) and the Brazilian limitada provide two common examples of foreign entities that lend themselves to this kind of international corporate and tax planning.  Each of these entities provides the foreign subsidiary with the limitation of liability desired for international corporate planning.  At the same time, the articles of incorporation of each of these entities can be drafted in such a way as to qualify it as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, thus permitting tax losses to flow through.  This string of moves only works in the Pentagon!<P>

The problem in the past has often been finding a limited liability entity in the relevant foreign country suitable for tax loss flow-through purposes, and then investing the extra time and work (and therefore cost) required to draft foreign organizational documents to meet partnership criteria under principles of U.S. tax law.  The IRSs proposed new regulations, if adopted, should go a long way towards correcting the problem by introducing a procedure for simply electing either corporation or partnership status.<P>

<strong>Current U.S. Law</strong><BR>

Under current principles of U.S. tax law, an entity (domestic or foreign) will be treated as a corporation if it has at least three of four characteristics:  limited liability,  free transferability of interests,  continuity of life  and centralized management . If two or more of these characteristics are absent and the company has more than one shareholder, it will be treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes.  If partnership status can be obtained, a U.S. corporation that is a member of a foreign partnership must recognize gains, and may deduct losses, attributable to its share of the operations of the foreign partnership. <P>

In structuring foreign limited liability companies to achieve loss flow-through for U.S. tax law purposes, compromises often have been required to eliminate at least two of the four characteristics of a corporation.  It is usually desirable to leave intact the characteristics of limited liability and centralized management.  Thus, in order to preserve partnership tax status, it is necessary to eliminate both of the remaining corporate characteristics of free transferability of interests and continuity of life.<P>

Free transferability of interests is sometimes eliminated by providing in the companys organizational documents that any transfer of an interest will automatically result in the dissolution of the company.  This is obviously a risky solution, particularly because the provision should cover all interests, including those held by minority shareholders.  Alternatively, free transferability is sometimes eliminated by requiring the consent of the other shareholders as a prerequisite to a transfer.  This consent needs to be meaningful, and the U.S. parent may sometimes be unwilling to subject its transfer rights to the consent of the other independent shareholders of the company.<P>

Eliminating continuity of life is somewhat easier.  This is generally accomplished by a provision for the termination of the companys existence upon the death, disability, retirement, or bankruptcy of any shareholder.  Upon the occurrence of any of these events, the company would dissolve unless a majority of the remaining shareholders consented to its continuation.  Usually it is possible to include these provisions in the organizational documents and avoid an unacceptable level of risk that the entity would be inadvertently terminated without some ability to maintain its existence.  Nonetheless, the reconstitution mechanism still needs to be permitted under local law.<P>

It is for these reasons that U.S. companies operating overseas through foreign limited liability company affiliates could benefit from the IRSs proposed new business classification regulations.  The new regulations would eliminate the uncertainties suggested above and replace the four characteristics test with a simple election procedure.<P>

<strong>Foreign Corporate Forms
</strong><BR>

Under the corporate laws of virtually all of the European Union countries (and most other civil law jurisdictions throughout the world), two common forms of business corporations are legislated.  One form is designed for corporations whose shares are intended to be publicly traded; and the other is for more closely-held companies.  Foreign legislation governing the public corporation typically provides for a higher level of required capitalization, more rigorous public reporting requirements, share certificates representing ownership of the company (similar to share certificates representing the ownership of a U.S. company) and a supervisory board of directors that oversees the companys management (similar to the board of directors of a U.S. company).  
<P>

By contrast, legislation governing the more closely held form of foreign corporation will have lower capital requirements, less onerous public reporting requirements, a mechanism for transferring shares on the books of the company without separate share certificates and no board of directors (with direct management oversight by the shareholders).  In England, the public form of corporation is referred to as a Public Limited Company (PLC), and the closely held form is a limited company (Ltd.).  In Germany, the public form of corporation is the Aktiengesellschaft (AG), and the closely held form is the GmbH.  In Brazil the public corporation is referred to as Associate Annonyma (SA), and the closely held form is the Limitado.  (Other countries use variations of the same nomenclature as Brazils.)  <P>

<strong>The IRS Proposal</strong><BR>

The new regulations proposed by the IRS list specific foreign entities which will always be considered as corporations for U.S. tax purposes.  As far as the European Union and other civil law jurisdictions throughout the world are concerned, the IRS has listed the public form of corporation for each country as an entity that will always be considered as a corporation for U.S. tax law purposes.  The proposed regulations do not specifically list by name the closely held form of company in European and other civil law jurisdictions.  Instead, each such form of company is referred to generically as an eligible entity.  An eligible entity is  an entity that is eligible to elect classification as either a corporation or a partnership.  If no election is made with respect to such an entity, it will be assigned a default classification.<P>

Because foreign close corporations (e.g., the Brazilian limitada or the German GmbH) are simpler and less costly to organize and maintain, they are normally preferred over their public corporation counterparts by U.S. companies wishing to conduct overseas operations through controlled foreign subsidiaries.  Thus, most U.S. companies operating overseas through foreign subsidiaries will have a foreign eligible entity with respect to which a decision will need to be made as to whether a classification election should be made under the new regulations.  A foreign eligible entity with limited liability will be classified by default as a corporation.  If the U.S. parent company wishes to have the entity treated as a partnership for U.S. tax law purposes, an appropriate election will need to be filed.

<strong>Filing Procedure</strong><BR>

It appears from the proposed regulations that the filing procedure will be simple.  It merely calls for a statement of the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the entity, the chosen classification, whether the election results in a change of classification, and whether the entity is a domestic or foreign eligible entity.  Once an election change has been made, the changed classification will need to be maintained for a minimum of five years.<P>

	Liberal transition rules are provided for foreign eligible entities in existence at the time the proposed regulations go into effect.  For example, the regulations suggest that a U.S. company that has been treating its existing foreign subsidiary as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes can expect that treatment to be honored by the IRS, provided there has been a reasonable basis for partnership treatment.

<FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT>	Because the foreign branch is a legal extension of the U.S. entity, its income and expenses are treated for U.S. tax purposes as part of the income and expenses of the U.S. entity of which it is a branch.  Reductions in U.S. taxes resulting from foreign branch loss deductions may be recaptured under IRC § 904(f) when the foreign operations become profitable.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>3</FONT>	Treasury Regulation § 301.7704-2<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>4</FONT>	An entity has limited liability for tax purposes if no member is liable for the debts of or claims against the organization.  Treasury Regulation § 301.7701-2(d)(1).<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>5</FONT>	An entity has free transferability of interests if substantially all of the members have the power, without the consent of the other members, to substitute for themselves in the same organization a person who is not a member of the organization.  Treasury Regulation § 301.7701-2(e)(1).<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>6</FONT>	An entity has continuity of life if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, retirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will not cause a dissolution of the organization.  Treasury Regulation § 301.7701-2(b)(1).<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>7</FONT>	An entity has centralized management if a group consisting of less than all of the members has continuing exclusive authority to make management decisions on behalf of the entity.  Treasury regulation § 301.7701-2(c)(1). A board of directors normally exercises this function in a traditional corporate setting.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>8</FONT>	The limited liability company laws in many of the civil law jurisdictions around the world require that the company have two or more shareholders.  A second shareholder for a German GmbH or a Brazilian limitada is conveniently supplied by the allotment of 1% of the shares to a corporate affiliate of the U.S. parent company or to the foreign subsidiarys managing director.  Foreign joint venture companies will have by definition at least two shareholders.<BR>

<H2>Preparing to Do Business in Chinas
Special Administrative Region</H2>



<H4>By Michelle L.D. Hanlon</H4>



The most frequently asked question regarding the integration of Hong Kong into the Peoples Republic of China is whether China as a communist regime can assume control of capitalist Hong Kong without destroying the financial freedoms important to its economic success.  Many believe that the legal and economic integrity of Hong Kong regulation will not survive a merger with a regulatory system based on favors, or guanxi and corruption.  As one investor put it, Chinese regulation works well for an economy based on making plastic flowers, but it cannot be imposed upon a sophisticated market dependent on all types of derivative financial instruments without dire consequences.<P>

Hong Kongs slow and tortured journey towards eventual integration with China, which is slated to occur on June 30, 1997, began in 1982 when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced that the British would not renew the 99 year lease currently binding Hong Kong to Britain.  In 1984, the two countries entered into the Sino-British Joint Declaration (the Joint Declaration), an international treaty which transfers sovereignty from Britain to China.<P>

The Joint Declaration mandates Hong Kongs status as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.  In the Joint Declaration, China pledged to permit Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years, hence the phrase, One Country, Two Systems attributed to Deng Xiaoping.  Hong Kong will legislate its own rules, covering all aspects of governance except for defense and foreign affairs.  Notwithstanding Chinas reservation of control in these two areas, Hong Kong will retain some autonomy in its foreign affairs.  It will, for instance, continue to represent itself in the World Trade Organization.  As such, Hong Kong will be able to maintain an international persona separate from China.<P>

The Joint Declaration also required China to distill the obligations enumerated therein into a form that would be enforceable domestically.  As a result, a mini-Constitution of 160 articles, known as the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR (the Basic Law), was promulgated in 1990.  This law in essence codifies the terms of Hong Kongs self-rule.  Importantly, it also reiterates Chinas commitment to preserve, among other things, Hong Kongs common law judicial system.<P>

<strong>Guanxi vs. Common Law</strong><br>

It is widely agreed that the key to an orderly transition and the maintenance of Hong Kongs economic success lies in the preservation of Hong Kongs common law legal system.  <P>

The financial markets rely and thrive upon legal certainty  a nonexistent commodity in China.  Indeed, anyone doing business in China will encounter regulations so secret they cannot be put in writing, or poorly disguised bribery practices so entrenched that fixed prices for licenses or zoning permits are the rule rather than the exception.  <P>

Even detailed contractual provisions fail to afford adequate protection in this environment where precedent and recorded case law are unknown.  The whims of local officials dictate the interpretation and enforcement of rules and regulations, and it is not uncommon to find boilerplate language construed in different ways throughout the separate provinces.  Moreover, the system of guanxi is itself inherently unreliable.  No matter who a foreign investor knows, a competitor is likely to find a connection with someone of higher rank.  <P>

By contrast, Hong Kongs legal system developed along the lines of the common law promulgated by its colonial sovereign, England.  The system is transparent, providing a level playing field with predictable rules governing both civil and criminal matters.  The free market economy of Hong Kong is shored up by a firm legal tradition of defending due process, property and contract rights. <P>
 
Both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law recognize the significance of Hong Kongs legal system.  Indeed, China has fully sanctioned future adherence to common law in Hong Kong, agreeing recently to the formation of a Court of Final Appeal which will sit in Hong Kong and take the place of Britains Privy Council.  However, China has imposed some limits.  China reserved the right to prevent the Court of Final Appeal from hearing any matters which can be considered acts of state.<P>

The lack of a clear definition of the term act of state is causing consternation in the financial community.  Many argue, correctly, that this loophole leaves much to the discretion of the government which may choose to interpret a wide variety of actions as acts of state.  Because it is impossible to predict Chinas behavior on this point, foreign investors must accept the risk that their actions in Hong Kong may be judged against Chinese legal principles.  But what is the level of this risk?<P>

Just as two systems will emerge as Hong Kong and China integrate, so are two schools of thought emerging with respect to the effect that integration will have on the business environment in Hong Kong.<P>

The optimists, including those whose businesses derive the majority of their profits from this financial center, long for a smooth transition.  These individuals hope that China will not upset the apple cart.  After all, the Mainlanders have much to gain, economically, and much to learn from the success story of Hong Kong.  The optimists are encouraged by what they consider to be Chinas commitment to the preservation of Hong Kongs common law system.<P>

Pessimists are quick to denounce the optimists as economic opportunists striving only to make the best of a dismal situation.  Pessimists point to Chinas historic intolerance of individual and economic freedoms and the tendency of government officials at every level to assert as much control as possible over enterprise.  These critics conclude that the financial atmosphere will be drastically changed if not wholly stymied by the transition, and urge businesses with a large presence in Hong Kong to diversify or retreat before June 30, 1997.<P>

Where does the truth lie?  Will China purposely subvert the common law system it has affirmatively agreed to preserve?  When dealing with the enigmatic China, the answer is anyones guess.  The great uncertainty surrounding Chinas internal stability makes predictions of Hong Kongs future all the more speculative.  Nevertheless, close analysis of the situation suggests that China will work towards preserving the integrity of Hong Kongs financial markets.  It is quite possible that, after an initial period of hesitancy, Hong Kongs financial and service markets will emerge from the integration as an even stronger economic force.<P>

<strong>The Golden Rice Bowl</strong><br>

In China, Hong Kong is commonly referred to as Chinas golden rice bowl.  It is well recognized that the colony, which has already been instrumental in the economic development of China, can enhance and expand capital and infrastructure investment to the degree necessary to make China an economic superpower.  As such, logic would dictate that it is in Chinas best interest to approach the impending integration of Hong Kong with a flexible attitude.  This overriding principle, coupled with the six factors enumerated below, suggest that China will work towards promoting Hong Kongs free economic market.<p>

<strong>Bloodless Revolution</strong><br>

Although integration will work a dramatic change in Hong Kongs governing structure, unlike in other former colonies, this revolution promises to be peaceful.  So far, China has acted with remarkable restraint as compared, for instance, to Indonesia in its bloody takeover of East Timor or to India in its seizure of Goa, both former Portuguese colonies.  China has pursued a decidedly mature approach to integration, and as such deserves some credit as we look into the future.<p>

<strong>Fundamental Bedrock</strong><br>

China has promised in writing to the United Nations that Hong Kong will continue to operate under its own rule of law for the next 50 years.  The border will remain closed and Hong Kong will maintain the right to formulate its own trade laws, monetary and financial policies, and to safeguard the free operation of its business and financial markets.  In addition, Hong Kong will be allowed to maintain its own currency.  The Hong Kong dollar will continue to be freely convertible, and foreign exchange, gold and securities markets will continue to operate.<P>

Further, Hong Kong will maintain its current set of liberal tax policies.  Beijing has agreed that it will not tax or otherwise attempt to extract revenue from Hong Kong.  In short, the systems currently in place, including the important regulatory and supervisory framework that has fostered Hong Kongs unprecedented history of economic growth will remain unchanged.

<strong>Track Record</strong><br>

While it would be foolhardy to take promises from the Chinese government at face value, the track record of the integration to date suggests that China is committed to a smooth transition.  The communist takeover of Hong Kong has been evolving for over a decade now, and during that decade Hong Kong has experienced double digit growth.  Indeed, even in the face of two potentially disastrous events, the Tiananmen massacre in 1989 and the Taiwan Straits incident of last March, the colonys financial market maintained a strong growth rate.  Many of the companies which fled Hong Kong in 1989 in response to the market-chilling massacre found themselves back in Hong Kong a year later, playing catch up with their brethren who decided to tough it out.<p>

<strong>The Taiwan Factor</strong><br>

While a smooth integration does not mean that Taiwan will come running back into the Chinese fold, a misstep by China at this time will entirely eliminate the opportunity for a peaceful reunion with the island nation.  Regardless of the designs China may have with respect to Taiwan, it would be unwise to jeopardize a chance for peaceful resolution, or even a mutually beneficial partnership with Taiwan by setting a bad example in Hong Kong.<p>

<strong>Economic Integration</strong><br>

China and Hong Kong are in large part already integrated economically.  Indeed, for many the political integration will be little more than a formalization of the economic realities that exist today.  Hong Kong has been instrumental in fueling Chinas economic growth.  It has provided a predictable, stable environment for Western business to build Asian headquarters.  Further, as the impressive Bank of China building symbolizes, Hong Kong has become a financial center for China as well.<P>

Hong Kong owes much of its wealth and power to its proximity to the cheap labor markets across the border in southern China and the multitude of major investment opportunities in the rest of China.  Hong Kong companies are investing enormous sums in infrastructure projects such as toll roads, power stations and urban development in China, ventures that will not begin to pay off until the next century.  Hong Kong investment in China totals over U.S. $60 billion, making it Chinas largest source of capital.<P>

Chinas commercial presence and influence in Hong Kongs trade, investment, finance and tourism industries have also been growing dramatically.  Over the last few years, Chinas capital investment in Hong Kong has grown to roughly U.S. $31 billion, and Hong Kong has become a prime destination for outgoing Chinese investment funds as well as for Chinese tourists.<p>

<strong>Chinas Revolution</strong><br>

Finally, China itself is rapidly transforming.  The Chinese economy has enjoyed unprecedented growth during the past decade.  Indeed, the economic transformation in China can be likened to the Industrial Revolution in 19th century Europe.  The xenophobic tendencies which gave rise to the Cultural Revolution are losing ground to pragmatic goals and realistic forecasts.  The Chinese have grown more open to suggestion and are willing to learn and to experiment.<P>

Indeed, China already looks to Hong Kong for guidance in financial and economic matters.  Shenzhen is one of Chinas most successful Special Economic Zones and operates with legislative autonomy.  It is not by coincidence that two-thirds of the laws enacted by the Shenzhen legislature have been borrowed from Hong Kong with the blessing of the Chinese central government.<p>

<strong>Speak Confidently but Carry a Foreign Passport</strong><br>

While the six factors discussed above suggest that China is committed to preserving Hong Kongs authority, the fact remains that the Chinese government has been dogged by corruption throughout its long history.  What if the pessimists are correct and guanxi replaces the common law as Hong Kongs market guide?  How can businesses protect themselves from the uncertainties of integration?<p>

<strong>Domicile</strong><br>

The first defense is to emulate the behavior of close to half of the companies that trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange: maintain legal status in a jurisdiction outside of Hong Kong such as Bermuda or the West Indies, in the event that quick flight is necessary.  Many companies are also setting up parallel offices in Singapore.  The key is not to abandon Hong Kong, but to set up protective barriers to protect your company from Chinese corruption.  Assets should remain out of the reach of the Chinese government and its local officials.<p>

<strong>Dispute Resolution</strong><br>

When contractual disputes have arisen in China, foreign companies have too often been forced to try to resolve issues by relying on guanxi rather than litigation.  While it is impossible to say how much of the tradition of guanxi and corruption will leak into Hong Kongs common law system, companies should protect their interests by contractually agreeing to have disputes resolved outside of China or Hong Kong.  American companies should, in particular, refrain from corruptive practices as such actions could lead to prosecution under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (see, International Law Notes, December 1995).<p>

<strong>The Future</strong><br>

Will the uncertainties of a legal and financial system based on connections, or guanxi, replace the certain and settled rule of law that has nurtured Hong Kongs financial success?  It is impossible to say today.  However, it is safe to assume that Beijing recognizes, as one senior Chinese official put it, that you must understand what makes an item valuable in order to preserve it.  Hopefully, China will not discard or destroy its golden rice bowl.  It has great incentives to promote Hong Kong as it exists today, and it has shown a strong intent to preserve and maintain the status quo.<P>

<TITLE>European Business Community Hails New Technology Transfer Block Exemption</TITLE>

<H2>European Business Community Hails New Technology Transfer Block Exemption</H2>

<H4>By J&ouml;rg Rehder</H4>

The Commission of the European Community (the Commission) recently enacted a new Technology Transfer block exemption (the Technology Exemption) based on a first draft introduced nearly two years ago.  The Technology Exemption entered into effect on April 1, 1996.<p>

<strong>Block Exemptions Generally</strong><br>

Over the years the Commission has enacted several block exemptions.  Block exemptions are safe harbor regulations pursuant to which the Commission will exempt certain arrangements from the anti-trust laws of the European Union (EU).  The primary benefit of a block exemption is that, if parties satisfy its conditions, they can avoid the often time-consuming and expensive procedure of individually notifying the Commission of intended arrangements; instead, they can rely on a block exemption.  Block exemptions also benefit parties in that they are public declarations on what clauses conflict with EU anti-trust laws.<P>

Block exemptions apply either to certain types of agreements or to agreements in a specific industry.  Two examples are the exemption governing distribution agreements and the exemption governing motor vehicle distribution and servicing agreements.  The block exemptions most relevant to this article are the Patent License Agreement exemption (Patent Exemption) and the Know-How License Agreement exemption (Know-How Exemption).  These two exemptions have been combined in the newly-enacted Technology Exemption.<p>

<strong>Effect of Technology Exemption</strong><br>

The stated purpose of the block exemption is to encourage the dissemination of technical knowledge in the [EU] and to promote the manufacture of technically more sophisticated products.  This goal is met by allowing parties to enter into certain types of technology transfer arrangements which would otherwise violate EU anti-trust laws.  Whether a certain clause is permissible depends on whether it is classified as a white, black or gray clause. These terms, though  not part of the Commissions official language, are commonly used by EU practitioners and in EU literature.<P>

To better understand the impact of these classifications, it is necessary to quickly discuss the lay out of EU anti-trust laws.
<p>

<strong>European Union Anti-Trust Laws</strong><br>

Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome are the primary provisions regarding antitrust law at the EU level.  Article 86 is not pertinent for purposes of this article as it discusses the abuse of dominant market positions.<P>

Article 85 is divided into three parts.  The first, Article 85(1), prohibits agreements and other actions which may restrict competition in the EU.  For practitioners familiar with U.S.  anti-trust law, this section is comparable to primary provisions of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.<P>

Different from U.S.  law, however, is the enforcement principles of the EU.  While the United States has adopted a rule of reason approach, the EU does not use such a balancing test.  Instead, Article 85(2) states that agreements which violate Article 85(1) are automatically void.  Article 85(3) defuses the rigidity of Article 85(2) by providing that Article 85(1) may not apply to certain agreements or actions if inter alia they benefit consumers.  Such arrangements may be exempt from Article 85(1).<P>

Those doing business in Europe should be aware that certain other avenues also exist which allow parties to avoid Article 85(1).  Probably the most common is the Notice on Agreements of Minor Importance.  Under this notice, the parties need not notify the Commission of a certain agreement if (i) it concerns less than 5% of the relevant market, and (ii) the parties combined annual aggregate revenue is less than 300 million ECU ($370 million).  Though this notice does not have the same legislative weight as a block exemption, it does provide parties with some comfort that the Commission will not review an arrangement where the parties meet the conditions of the notice.  The Commission views arrangements between smaller parties as having a negligible impact on competition, and thus, does not require notification.<p>

<strong>Classification of Clauses</strong><br>

The <a href="ib8white.html">white list</a> contains clauses which do not fall within the ambit of Article 85(1).  Contrary to what the name may indicate, the <a href="ib8black.html">black list</a> does not contain clauses which are automatically void, instead, if parties want to ensure that an arrangement which includes black-list clauses does not conflict with Article 85(1), they must notify it to the Commission for clearance.  A block exemption cannot apply to a clause on a black list.<P>

Finally, because these lists do not include all types of arrangements, the Commission has implemented an opposition procedure for arrangements not specifically mentioned in the exemption (the so-called <a href="ib8gray.html">gray list</a>).  At the parties initiative, they must obtain an individual exemption for any questionable arrangements to ensure that the Commission will not later void the arrangement and possibly subject the parties to a fine.  The opposition procedure is such that if the Commission does not oppose the arrangement for four months after notification, it is exempt.  To indicate the Commissions desire to further facilitate the transfer of technology, it shortened the opposition procedure from six months (as was the case in the Patent and Know-How Exemptions) to four months in the Technology Exemption.<p>

<strong>Amendment to Draft Technology Exemption</strong><br>

The European business community originally considered the Technology Exemption too unyielding.  The draft was written so that the exemption would not apply if an arrangement between parties would prevent competition; according to the language of the draft, this would in particular occur where the licensees market share exceed[ed] 40%.  This specific clause drew heavy criticism as the European business community believed that far too many agreements would unnecessarily need to go through the notification process, thereby causing a stifling effect on business.<P>

As a compromise, the Commission changed the wording of the exemption.  The final version of the Technology Exemption states that the Commission will pay special attention to cases where the licensee has more than 40% of the market (emphasis added).  Of course, only time will tell to what extent the Commission will pay special attention to certain arrangements.  Judging from statements made by European business leaders, they expect the Commission to adhere to the spirit of the exemption, i.e., to withdraw the exemption only if an arrangement actually impedes competition.<p>

<strong>Scope of Technology Exemption</strong><br>

The Technology Exemption does not apply to all patent and know-how licensing agreements within the EU.  The scope of the exemption is limited to agreements where the licensee either manufactures or is responsible for the manufacture of the licensed goods (if the subject of the agreement is a service, the licensee must either provide the services or be responsible for their provision).  Excluded from the Technology Exemption are franchise agreements, license agreements solely for the purpose of the sale of goods or services and joint venture agreements between competitors.<P>

Though the Commission backed off from its original intent of requiring notification for all technology transfer agreements where the licensee has a 40% market share, it expressly reserved the right not to afford parties the benefits of the exemption if an arrangement has anti-competitive effects.  Situations which may cause the Commission to withdraw the benefits of the exemption include: (i) refusing to fill unsolicited orders from within the territory of other licensees, (ii) making it difficult for buyers to obtain the licensed product from other European sellers, or (iii) prohibiting the licensee from using the technology of the licensors competitors when the licensor and licensee are in competition with one another.  <p>

<strong>Continued Applicability of Patent Exemption and Know-How Exemption</strong><br>

Though the Technology Exemption combines the Patent Exemption and the Know-How Exemption, they are not totally without effect.  The former was to have expired on December 31, 1994 (it was extended through March 31, 1996, to allow for the enactment of the new exemption), while the latter was to remain in effect through the end of 1999.  Since a large number of parties relied, and continue to rely, on exemptions granted under these regulations, the Commission has provided for a transition period.  Any exemptions granted prior to March 31, 1996, under one of these two exemptions may continue in effect until 2006.<P>

Since the Technology Exemption does not distinguish between patents and know-how, parties may incur difficulties when trying to determine whether their arrangement falls within the reach of the new exemption.  Failure to analyze the exemption correctly may cause the Commission to declare an arrangement void; it also risks the possibility that the Commission will levy a fine against the parties for violating EU anti-trust laws.  Companies engaged in the licensing of patents or know-how should analyze their arrangement carefully to avoid such an occurrence.

<H2>Unreasonable Restrictions 
on Parallel Imports Prohibited</H2>

<H4>By Richard Y. Sako</H4>

Parallel importing, that is the importation of a product through channels other than those arranged between the manufacturer of the product and its authorized distributors, is generally considered to promote price competition in a market, and therefore restrictions on parallel importing are viewed with scrutiny under the antitrust rules and regulations of most countries.  The Antimonopoly Law of Japan (the Antimonopoly Law) is no exception.  The guidelines to the Antimonopoly Law concerning Distribution Systems and Business Practices in Japan specifically address forms of restrictive conduct with respect to parallel importing which are deemed to be violations of  the Antimonopoly Law.  Two recent warning rulings of the Japan Fair Trade Commission (FTC) highlight the need for foreign manufacturers to be aware of potential antitrust law violations if they assist their authorized distributors in restricting sales of their products to parallel importers located in Japan.  <P>

On February 29, 1996, the FTC ordered Hoshi Shoji Kabushiki Gaisha to cease its practice of restricting parallel imports.  Hoshi Shoji is the exclusive Japanese distributor for Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd., a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain products.  The FTC ruled that Hoshi Shoji violated the Antimonopoly Law by obstructing imports of Herend products by a Japanese discounter which was selling the products at prices 30% lower than Hoshi Shojis list prices.  The FTC also found that Hoshi Shoji had taken similar steps in the past to obstruct imports of Herend products by other discounters as well.  According to the FTC, Hoshi Shoji was able to determine that the discounters were purchasing Herend products from various authorized European distributors of Herend by checking the serial numbers on products sold at the discounters stores.  Hoshi Shoji, with the assistance of Herend, notified the European distributors to stop selling products to the discounters, thus effectively cutting off the discounters access to Herend products.  Although no fines or penalties were assessed against Hoshi Shoji, the FTC ordered Hoshi Shoji to immediately cease in its conduct or face the threat of administrative proceedings which could ultimately result in the assessment of civil fines and criminal penalties.  <P>

On April 5, 1996, the FTC issued a similar warning to Kabushiki Gaisha Matsuogaki Shokai, the exclusive Japanese distributor for U.S.-based Steinway & Sons.   According to the FTC, Matsuogaki, with the assistance of Steinway & Sons, acted jointly to prevent Steinway & Sons Holland distributor from selling Steinway pianos to discount importers in Japan.  Matsuogaki was able to determine the place of origin of the pianos sold by discounters by checking the manufacturers numbers on the pianos.  As in the case of Hoshi Shoji, the FTC ordered Matsuogaki to immediately cease its practice or face administrative proceedings with possible civil fines and criminal penalties.<P>

These rulings are significant because in each case the FTC declined to make any mention of the market power of the Japanese distributors involved.  The rulings underscore the importance that all U.S. exporters must exercise care and caution in their activities with their Japanese distributors, even exporters which do not approach a dominant position in the Japanese market for their products.

<H2>Harbor Maintenance Tax Refunds for U.S. Exporters</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Michael E. Murphy</h4>

If your company has exported products by ocean freight at any time since April 1, 1987, it may be entitled to a refund of a Harbor Maintenance Tax ("HMT") to which all waterborne exports have been subjected since that date.
The U.S. Court of International Trade recently ruled in U.S. Shoe Corp. v. United States that the 0.125% ad valorem HMT is unconstitutional as it violates Article I, Section 9, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits the government from imposing taxes on exports.<P>

Congress enacted the HMT in 1987, ostensibly to raise revenues specifically earmarked for the maintenance of U.S. harbors.
In fact, the revenues raised by this tax have substantially exceeded the sums required to maintain the harbors.
As a result, the Treasury has accumulated some $700 million in excess of reasonable reserves for harbor maintenance -- the excess revenues have been used for other purposes.
The Court found that the HMT was more than merely a tax on users of harbors to fund the maintenance of those harbors; rather, the Court held, it was an export tax for general revenue raising purposes.
Such a tax violates Article I of the Constitution.<P>

<H2>Foreign Joint Ventures:  Selected Corporate, Tax and Regulatory Issues</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Michael E. Murphy</h4>
<p>


For companies with limited financial and human resources, the joint venture can be an ideal vehicle for developing foreign markets for the company's goods or services.  Normally, a company will consider a joint venture after it has reached three conclusions:  (1) export sales or market research indicate that a significant market exists in a foreign country or area of the world; (2) the use of foreign sales representatives or distributors is limiting development of the market because the representatives or distributors divide their time and resources among several product lines, suppliers and countries or seek high margins rather than market share; and (3) the company either lacks or cannot allocate sufficient financial resources and personnel with international business capabilities to develop the foreign markets.  The two most common forms of international joint venture are the contract joint venture and the corporate joint venture.  

<P>

<H4>Contract Joint Venture
</H4>
The contract joint venture is an arrangement made directly between the U.S. company and its foreign partner rather than through a third party vehicle, such as a jointly owned corporation.  The contract joint venture is often used where the proposed joint enterprise has discrete characteristics, such as a single construction project or the pooling of technologies and know-how for the development of a product which the parties intend to manufacture and market separately for antitrust or other business reasons.  The contract joint venture may also be used where the parties, who may not know one another well and do not wish to be tied together through a mutual investment in a corporation, may wish to make a quick, clean exit from the joint venture.  The contract joint venture, if properly structured, can be a relatively simple vehicle through which to enter and exit a joint venture.

<P>
		
This type of joint venture has three potentially significant disadvantages.  First, the parties to the joint venture will be directly responsible for any torts, breaches of contract or violations of government regulations resulting from their joint business enterprise; whereas, the interposition of a corporate joint venture vehicle, if properly structured, will insulate the parties and their personnel from these and other liabilities arising from the activities of the joint venture enterprise.  Secondly, the parties to a contract joint venture directly incur expenses and realize income associated with their joint enterprise.  This can limit the parties' options when it comes to tax planning, use of credit facilities, and reporting to shareholders.  Third, a contract joint venture may lack the air of permanence and commitment associated with the creation of a legal entity, which may be detrimental in the market.

<P>

<H4>Corporate Joint Venture</H4>

The corporate joint venture is the more common vehicle for an international joint venture because it provides the parties with an additional layer of insulation from liability and wider latitude for accounting and tax planning.  Moreover, a corporate joint venture can be a powerful marketing tool for the party whose name it bears.  For example, if Abco Inc., a U.S. company, forms a corporate joint venture with a minority shareholder in Germany and the company is called Abco GmbH, Abco can advertise in the United States, Germany and elsewhere abroad that it has direct operations of its own in Europe, thereby enhancing the public image of its size and stability.

<P>
		
A U.S. company will often find a foreign joint venture partner in its local distributor, in circumstances where both parties have come to realize that the foreign market for the U.S. company's products or services is significant and that the foreign market cannot be further developed without the distributor's full-time attention.  The distributor, who will be committing itself to the U.S. supplier, will often want an equity participation in the venture in return for its commitment.  Conversely, the U.S. company will need and want local participation in the venture; the foreign distributor will be welcomed for its investment, for its knowledge of the local market and for its foreign language skills and understanding of the local culture.  Because the parties are known quantities to each other due to their pre-existing supplier-distributor relationship, and because they both see a long term future for the U.S. company's products or services in the foreign market, the corporate form of joint venture is usually desired.  

<P>

<H4>Joint Ventures in Civil Code 
Jurisdictions</H4>
		
The vast majority of foreign countries in which American companies may be forming joint ventures will be countries that have legal systems based on European civil codes.  Corporations in civil code countries have historically been required to have two or more shareholders.  Under  civil code systems, the corporation exists by reason of an agreement between two or more persons to pool resources for a common business enterprise.  By contrast, in the U.S. it is the issuance of a certificate of incorporation by the Secretary of State of the state in which a corporation is formed that evidences the existence of a corporation.  Thus, the concept of a corporation with a single shareholder has never been an anomaly in our legal system.  In the European Union, the corporate laws of the member countries have been revised to allow single-shareholder corporations as a result of harmonization directives adopted in the 1980s.

<P>
		
All of this should be of more than academic interest to the American company with an investment in a joint venture corporation in a civil code jurisdiction.  Frequently, the joint venture agreement will provide the American party with an option to purchase its foreign partner's shares in the joint venture company.  If such an option exists and is exercised, the American party will need to be prepared to nominate a second or qualifying shareholder if the joint venture company is formed under the laws of a civil code jurisdiction that requires more than one shareholder.  The Brazilian limitada is one popular example.

<P>

<H4>Government Controls</H4>
		
Foreign host country controls restricting in-bound foreign direct investment have been largely dismantled in most countries over the past decade.  However, certain developed countries continue to require government permission for investment in or control over local business operations.  Some of these countries are becoming increasingly popular venues for foreign joint ventures by U.S. companies.  India is an example.  

<P>

With the break-up of the Soviet Union, Indian trading and investment policy has made a marked turn toward the West.  India continues to maintain, however, an in-bound direct investment control regime which U.S. companies need to take into account when planning a joint venture there. 

<P>

In general, foreign direct investment into India requires the approval of both the Reserve Bank of India and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.  Investment in so-called priority sectors is eligible for automatic approval of up to 51 percent foreign equity ownership, provided the foreign equity meets foreign exchange requirements for imported capital goods and the foreign investor complies with guidelines relating to lump sum and royalty payments.  Priority sectors include industries relating to electrical, transportation and industrial equipment, chemicals, drugs and pharmaceuticals and numerous other sectors designated as such in Annex III of the New Industrial Policy, 1991 issued by the Indian Government.  In non-priority sectors (including most consumer goods), the permissible level of foreign equity ownership is determined on a case-by-case basis.  For export-oriented units, foreign ownership as high as 100 percent has been permitted.

<P>
		
It is commonplace today for the smaller, cash-poor but technology-rich U.S. company to use the foreign joint venture as a vehicle to produce and distribute products abroad as a means of sustaining itself, for example, pending FDA approval of its medical products.  This is particularly the case with emerging medical device companies.  Such companies can be lured into capitalizing the foreign joint venture company by transferring to it their technologies in exchange for a share in the equity of the joint venture company.  However, this could prove a costly method of capitalizing the company.  U.S. tax law allows the IRS to treat transfers of intangible property by U.S. companies to their foreign affiliates as a licensing arrangement for federal tax purposes with the effect of requiring the U.S. transferor, several years after the transfer in question, to pay substantial U.S. income taxes on a stream of royalty earnings which the U.S. company in fact never receives.  U.S. companies with foreign joint venture partners need to pay careful attention to other U.S. and foreign tax rules governing the pricing of goods and services between international affiliates.  

<P>

<H4>Entering Foreign Markets</H4>

If properly structured, however, the corporate joint venture vehicle can provide the U.S. party with the flexibility of either expanding or contracting its investment with relatively few legal complications.  With an option in the hands of the U.S. party to purchase some or all of its foreign partner's shares in the joint venture company, the U.S. party has the flexibility to expand its foreign direct investment in the host country.  With provisions in the joint venture agreement permitting the U.S. party to sell its shares in the joint venture company to its foreign partner, or with other provisions establishing criteria under which the foreign partner will assume responsibilities for the facilities and personnel accumulated in the joint venture company, the U.S. party can have an economical exit strategy as well.  The joint venture can be the ideal vehicle for smaller and medium-sized companies with limited financial and human resources to enter foreign markets where there is strong potential for the company's goods or services.

<H2>Transfer Pricing and the Use of Advance Pricing Agreements
in Germany and the United States</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>J&ouml;rg Rehder</h4>
<p>


A 1995 Ernst & Young study indicated that approximately 50 percent of multinational corporations (MNCs) believe that transfer pricing is the most significant international tax issue they face.  Considering that the issue perceived to be the second most important  tax rates in other countries  garnered only 7 percent of the vote, this study clearly indicates what is on the minds of tax planners and advisors of MNCs.  Because most countries continue to devote more money and personnel to investigate potential transfer price abuses, MNCs will undoubtedly need to continue to focus their attention on this issue.  

<P>

<H4>Contract Joint Venture
</H4>

As tax authorities step up their enforcement measures, and the number of time-consuming and expensive audits continues to rise, MNCs are seeking an alternative which will allow them to devote fewer resources to remaining in compliance with transfer pricing regulations.  At the same time, tax authorities in many jurisdictions are looking for a way to conduct their transfer pricing enforcement measures more efficiently.  One such alternative is to enter into an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA).  An APA is an agreement between an MNC taxpayer and one or more tax authorities which binds the parties to a transfer pricing method for transactions over a fixed period.  The parties negotiate the agreement prior to the transactions in issue.

<P>
		
This article will briefly outline the increased enforcement measures undertaken by two countries  Germany and the United States  and then discuss what impact these measures have had on the use of APAs in these countries.

<P>

The corporate joint venture is the more common vehicle for an international joint venture because it provides the parties with an additional layer of insulation from liability and wider latitude for accounting and tax planning.  Moreover, a corporate joint venture can be a powerful marketing tool for the party whose name it bears.  For example, if Abco Inc., a U.S. company, forms a corporate joint venture with a minority shareholder in Germany and the company is called Abco GmbH, Abco can advertise in the United States, Germany and elsewhere abroad that it has direct operations of its own in Europe, thereby enhancing the public image of its size and stability.

<P>

<H4>Global Tax War</H4>	
	
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has issued guidelines recommending to its members how to combat alleged transfer pricing abuses.  The OECD most recently amended its guidelines on July 27, 1995.  The three primary transfer methods discussed in the OECD guidelines are as follows: 

<P>

(i)	Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method  comparing the price actually charged to an affiliated company with the price which would be charged in a similar transaction with an unrelated buyer;

(ii)	Resale Price Method  subtracting the buyer's normal profit margin from the actual sales price to an unrelated buyer in a similar transaction; or

(iii)	Cost Plus Method  adding the costs of the seller to the profit normally realized by the seller ina similar transaction with an unrelated buyer.

<P>
		
Each of these methods is based on the principle that transactions between affiliated companies should be priced on an arm's length basis, i.e., the affiliated parties should structure their transactions as if they were not related.  In those instances where a comparable transaction does not exist, the parties may use another appropriate method consistent with the principle of an arm's length transaction.  The arm's length standard is codified in regulations promulgated under § 482 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States and in § 1 of the International Tax Act (Außensteuergesetz) in Germany.  The transfer pricing regulations in the United States and Germany are based on the OECD's guidelines.  Failure to implement one of these pricing methods in Germany or the United States will draw the attention of the respective tax authorities and increase the likelihood of an audit.

<P>

<H4>Transfer Pricing in the United States and Germany</H4>
		
The United States was the first country to pursue transfer pricing abuses  aggressively.  Beginning with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and continuing with the IRS's and Treasury Department's joint publication of the White Paper on Transfer Pricing two years later, the U.S. appropriated more funds and increased the size of staffs to better oversee MNCs' transfer pricing compliance.  Consequently, tax authorities reviewed tax returns more extensively, investigated potential transfer pricing abuses more thoroughly and imposed stiffer penalties for transfer pricing violations.  This effort had a domino effect in other parts of the world as other countries soon recognized that their respective tax bases would suffer if they did not follow the American example.  Germany was one of these countries. 

<P>

	
German tax authorities became more aware of transfer price abuses as they stepped up their investigatory measures.  Since 1990, the Finanz-ämter (German tax administrators) have made a concerted effort to increase their enforcement measures at both the state and federal levels.  The result has been clear  more German companies have been the subject of audits, at both the parent and the subsidiary levels. 

<P>

Evidence that German tax authorities have cracked down on transfer price abuses can be seen from a case before Germany's highest tax court (Bundesfinanzhof) in 1993, one of the few transfer pricing cases heard by this court.  The court adjusted the profits of a newly-formed German company after concluding that the company's pricing method for penetrating the German market was not comparable to that of other companies, i.e., it failed to adhere to the arm's length principle.  Instead of passing on some of the market penetration costs to its affiliated Danish companies, the German company assumed all such costs.  After investigating this arrangement, the court held it was not reasonable for a company to assume 100 percent of the market penetration costs knowing that it would not realize a profit within a reasonable time if it continued doing business in such a manner.

<P>

<H4>Advance Pricing Agreements</H4>

It is commonplace today for the smaller, cash-poor but technology-rich U.S. company to use the foreign joint venture as a vehicle to produce and distribute products abroad as a means of sustaining itself, for example, pending FDA approval of its medical products.  This is particularly the case with emerging medical device companies.  Such companies can be lured into capitalizing the foreign joint venture company by transferring to it their technologies in exchange for a share in the equity of the joint venture company.  However, this could prove a costly method of capitalizing the company.  U.S. tax law allows the IRS to treat transfers of intangible property by U.S. companies to their foreign affiliates as a licensing arrangement for federal tax purposes with the effect of requiring the U.S. transferor, several years after the transfer in question, to pay substantial U.S. income taxes on a stream of royalty earnings which the U.S. company in fact never receives.  U.S. companies with foreign joint venture partners need to pay careful attention to other U.S. and foreign tax rules governing the pricing of goods and services between international affiliates.  

<P>

One world-wide consequence of these increased efforts has been the advent of Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs).  MNCs hoped that APAs would lead to the predictability of tax liabilities and the avoidance of double taxation, while tax authorities hoped APAs would lead to a decrease in transfer price abuses.

<P>

In 1991 the IRS published a revenue procedure consisting of guidelines to enter into an APA.  The procedural ruling departed from prior IRS policy in that, in the past, the IRS had been reluctant to enter into agreements based largely on projections rather than facts.

<P>
	
The IRS changed its position regarding APAs primarily in response to the increased complexity of transactions and corporate structures and the realization that it did not have the resources to complete as many audits as would otherwise be necessary.  Some corporate taxpayers also welcomed the opportunity to enter into APAs as legislative amendments heightened their concern that they were violating transfer pricing rules, and therefore, subject to possible adjustments and penalties.  Further, many foreign corporations doing business in the United States were fearful that they were not meeting the extensive IRS reporting requirements and were subjecting themselves to potential penalties.  (Because the parties negotiate APAs with the relevant tax authority prior to the transactions, foreign corporations can be certain they are in compliance with all tax-related reporting requirement once they enter into an APA with the IRS.)

<P>

<H4>Use of APAs in the United States</H4>
	
Corporations in the United States initially viewed APAs with skepticism  due in large part to a fear of the unknown.  Few companies were willing to be the first to test the waters to determine whether APAs would be as effective as hoped.  Companies feared that if an APA was not concluded after negotiations had already been initiated, they would only increase their odds of being audited as they would have disclosed information to the IRS that they would otherwise not have disclosed.  Nevertheless, an astounding 96 percent of the American respondents to Ernst & Young's survey stated that they believed that the use of APAs would continue to grow.

<P>	

Apple Computers, having been the subject of several transfer pricing adjustments, was the first U.S. company to enter into an APA when it came to terms with U.S. and Australian tax authorities.  Apple has since also entered into APAs with tax authorities in Canada and Japan.  Citing the avoidance of potential double taxation and the advantage of predictability of tax liability, Apple has expressed satisfaction with its APAs.

<P>

<H4>Use of APAs in Germany</H4>
	

Though the future for APAs looks bright in the United States, this is not the case in Germany.  According to Ernst & Young's survey, only 68 percent of the German respondents stated that they believed the use of APAs will grow.  (Only French respondents were less confident about APAs  only 64 percent of French MNCs believed that the use of APAs would increase.)  A resounding 24 percent of the German respondents believed that the use of APAs would not increase.  (Germany was the leader in this category.)

<P>
	
Much of this wariness stems from German tax authorities' stance toward APAs.  German tax authorities have adopted a wait-and-see approach to see how APAs are received in other countries before committing resources to such agreements.

<P>
	
Not only do German tax authorities not favor the use of APAs in their home jurisdiction, they also view foreign APAs with some reservation.  According to a strongly worded announcement by the tax authorities of the state of Baden-Württemberg, tax authorities in that state should not feel compelled to honor the terms of a unilateral APA if it would have an adverse impact on Germany's tax base.  The announcement states that unilateral APAs are subject to review and to a possible adjustment.  Germany's federal tax authority, as well as the Finanzämter of Germany's other states, supported this announcement.

<P>	

If a taxpayer does not agree with a transfer pricing adjustment, it may initiate a review procedure pursuant to the Principles Relating to the Review of Income Allocation of International Affiliated Corporations (Grundsätze für die Prüfung der Einkünftsabgrenzung bei international verbundenen Unternehmen).  These Principles, which are actually the Federal Ministry of Finance's interpretation of Germany's transfer pricing rules, call for a review of disputed adjustments.  Such a review procedure can be comparable to a full-fledged audit.

<P>
	
Companies in the United States with affiliated German companies should be careful when entering into an APA which is also to have an impact in Germany.  If information shared with the IRS during the APA negotiations is not also shared with German tax authorities (with the approval of the company), and the German tax authorities determine that their tax base was not sufficiently considered during negotiations with the IRS, companies can be quite certain that German tax authorities will review the APA with great scrutiny and possibly demand an adjustment and penalties.

<P>

<H4>Use of APAs in Other 
Jurisdictions</H4>
	
Bilateral or multilateral APAs are far more likely to reduce the risk of double taxation than are unilateral APAs.  For this reason, they are preferable to unilateral APAs.  Many jurisdictions have expressed a favorable attitude towards entering into such agreements.  These jurisdictions include the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan and the United Kingdom.  France and Germany have shown the greatest reluctance to enter into APAs, whether bilateral or unilateral.
	
<P>

When pursuing an APA, a company should keep the following points in mind:

<UL>
<LI>It should be prepared to cooperate with tax authorities in terms of disclosing financial information to be able to present convincingly its intended transfer pricing methodology.
<LI>It can buttress its arguments if it can also provide tax authorities with data concerning the industry and countries to be covered by the APA.
<LI>It should be able to identify uncontrolled transactions similar to the transactions to be covered by the APA.
<LI>It should request confirmation from the tax authorities that no transfer pricing adjustments will be made so long as the company complies with the terms of the APA.
<LI>An escape clause should be included in each APA to cover those circumstances where economic conditions change significantly, thereby allowing the company to change its transfer pricing methodology.
<LI>Prior to entering into negotiations with tax authorities, a company should request that the tax authorities keep the disclosed information confidential.
</UL>

<H2>Japan Adopts Product Liability Law</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Richard Y. Sako</h4>
<p>


After many years of debate, the Japanese Parliament approved and adopted a Product Liability Law (PL Law) in the summer of 1994.  The new law took effect on July 1, 1995.  The PL Law is modeled on its EU counterpart, which is generally regarded as being less stringent than U.S. product liability law.  

<P>

Under the PL Law, manufacturers, processors and importers are liable for damages caused by defects in any product which they have manufactured, processed or imported.  The PL Law does not cover cases in which a contract exists directly between a consumer and a manufacturer, such as in the case of the purchase of newly developed housing lots and the construction of new homes.  Nor does the PL Law  apply to services and agricultural and animal products.  Claims for compensation of damages under the PL Law are subject to a statute of limitation of (i)  the longer of three years after the victim or its legal representative becomes aware of the damage and the identity of the party responsible for the damage, and (ii)  ten years after the manufacturer, processor or importer delivered the product.

<P>

The PL Law has been criticized by consumer groups in Japan and the Japanese Bar Association in three principal respects:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Under the PL Law, a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective at the time it was first placed for sale rather than at the time of occurrence of the injury.
<LI>Under the PL Law, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the product was defective.  Consumer groups lobbied strongly for inclusion of an inference clause which would classify a product as defective if an accident occurs while the plaintiff was using the product correctly.  This clause was not adopted.
<LI>Under the PL Law, a manufacturer, processor or importer is not liable for a product defect if the defect was not foreseeable given the level of scientific or technological knowledge in existence at the time the product was delivered.  Consumer groups had argued that the level of knowledge should be the highest scientific and technological level available to a standard manufacturer as opposed to the average standard of knowledge of technology in the industry.
</UL>


<P>

Consumer groups maintain that the absence of an inference clause and the requirement that the plaintiff prove that the product in question was defective when initially offered for sale substantially weakens the impact of the law because the absence of pre-trial discovery in Japan and limited access to corporate records create very high problems of proof.  Notwithstanding such criticism, the PL Law appears to have accomplished its initial goal of making product safety a leading concern of manufacturers selling in Japan.  For example, manufacturers of toys and stationary products are reevaluating their products based on child safety concerns and have taken such measures as eliminating small pieces that children may choke on or coating pieces with bitter tasting resins to keep them out of children's mouths.  Manufacturers' associations have also conducted studies of European and U.S. products, which are generally recognized as being more advanced in the area of product safety, and have published guidelines available to manufacturers to assist them in making their products safer.  For example, the Japanese frozen food association has published guidelines on product labeling requirements based on its review of food product labels currently in use by European and U.S. food manufacturers.

<H2>Recent Changes to English Sales Laws</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Derek S. Devgun</h4>

Recent significant changes have been made to English laws governing contracts for the sale of goods.  Given that the United Kingdom has not implemented the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods into its domestic law, these changes are important for parties whose contracts are to be governed by English law whether by election of the parties or because English law is the proper law of the contract.

<P>

The Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 (the 1994 Act) came into force on January 3, 1995, and applies to all contracts for the sale of goods made on or after that date.  The 1994 Act amends the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (the 1979 Act) and related statutes, in an attempt to clarify certain antiquated provisions of the 1979 Act and to update and strengthen the rights of consumers.  The 1994 Act essentially implements the conclusions of Law Commissions contained in reports published in 1987 which recommended changes to the 1979 Act.

<H4>Warranty of 
Satisfactory Quality</H4>

Perhaps the major change adopted under the 1994 Act is the replacement of the concept of the implied warranty of merchantability with one of satisfactory quality.  English courts had interpreted the phrase merchantability to mean that the major factor relevant in deciding whether goods were merchantable was the fitness of the goods for their purpose.  Other characteristics were largely irrelevant, and the exact extent to which minor and cosmetic defects were to be taken into account was unclear.

<P>

The new standard, satisfactory quality, requires that the goods meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all other relevant circumstances.  This test involves a broader inquiry into the quality of the goods in question, and expressly requires that the following factors be considered when assessing breach of warranty:  fitness for purpose, appearance and finish, freedom from minor defects, safety and durability.

<P>

Like the former warranty of merchantability, the new implied warranty of satisfactory quality may be excluded by express agreement.  Where English law applies to the contract only because the parties elect it by express choice, the parties may exclude the warranty unconditionally.  Where English law would apply to the contract under choice-of-law rules, however, exclusion of the warranty must meet a standard of reasonableness.

<H4>Acceptance</H4>

The 1994 Act also amends the 1979 Act by requiring that a buyer be given a reasonable opportunity to inspect goods before a buyer accepts, or is deemed to have accepted, the goods.

<P>

The basic rule remains that acceptance of goods will be deemed to occur when (i) a buyer intimates acceptance to the seller, or (ii) the seller delivers the goods and the buyer engages in any action which is inconsistent with the seller's ownership of the goods.  However, in either case, the buyer must have had a reasonable opportunity to examine the goods before a buyer can be deemed to have accepted the goods.  Furthermore, mere delivery by the buyer to a third party under a re-sale or other disposition does not necessarily imply acceptance by the buyer.

<P>

The other method of acceptance in the 1979 Act, the lapse of a reasonable time, is also retained.  However, the availability to the buyer of an opportunity to inspect the goods is one factor to be taken into account in determining whether a reasonable time has elapsed.

<H4>Right of Partial Rejection</H4>

The 1994 Act also introduces a new concept into English sales law, the right of a buyer to reject part of a shipment of goods.  Under the 1979 Act, a buyer either had to reject the entire shipment or accept the entire shipment and claim damages from the seller.  After the 1994 Act, the buyer is entitled to accept those goods in good condition and reject the rest.  The right to reject the entire shipment remains unaffected by these changes.

<H2>London Stock 
Exchange - New
Market to be Launched</H2>

On February 15, 1995, the London Stock Exchange published its rules for the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). It has been specially created to meet the needs of smaller and growing companies seeking to raise public finance in the United Kingdom and to have their shares more widely traded.  AIM has been widely reported in the media as being based on the highly successful NASDAQ market familiar to readers in the United States.
	
<p>

It is intended that AIM be launched on June 19, 1995, but applications to join it may be submitted as soon as the Public Offers of Securities Regulations have been published.  This is expected to occur shortly.  They will replace Part III of the Companies Act 1985 (with Part V of the Financial Services Act 1986 no longer coming into force) and will contain the statutory requirements for the publication of prospectuses by unlisted companies.
	
<p>

Following the introduction of AIM, the Unlisted Securities Market (which is no longer accepting new members) will be abolished next year.  At that time, companies on the Unlisted Securities Market must join either AIM or move up to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.  The latter is primarily for larger companies with a trading record of at least three years.  In contrast to the Official List, which requires that at least 25% of a company's shares be publicly held, AIM will not require a minimum number of shares to be publicly held.
	
<p>

The occasional dealing facility under Rule 4.2 of the Rules of the Stock Exchange (previously referred to as the Rule 535 facility), under which the shares of certain companies may be traded on a matched bargains basis, will disappear in its current form.  The Stock Exchange has said that when AIM opens, Rule 4.2 will be amended to apply only to suspended securities, although it has indicated that it may operate a very occasional dealing facility, but on a highly restricted basis.
	
<p>

In order for a company to be included in AIM it must meet the following requirements:<BR>

<OL TYPE=i, ii, iii, ...>

<LI>It must have a nominated adviser and a nominated broker.  The adviser will assist in the admission procedure to AIM and ensure that the company complies with the Stock Exchange's requirements.  The adviser's role is similar to that of the sponsor for admission to the Official List.  The adviser must be drawn from a register of approved advisers maintained by the Stock Exchange.  The broker must be a member of the Stock Exchange.  The broker will promote trading in the shares of the company by using its best efforts to match buyers and sellers of the company's shares and by providing information to the market via SEATS PLUS (the service on which AIM securities are to be traded).<br>
<LI>The company must be legally established under the laws of the country of incorporation as a public company.<br>
<LI>It must have published accounts that conform to the generally accepted accounting principles of either the United Kingdom or the United States or to international accounting standards.<br>
<LI>The securities to be traded on AIM must be freely transferable.<br>
<LI>The company must adopt a code for Directors' dealings with regard to acquiring or disposing of securities, as provided in AIM's rules.<br>
</OL>


<p>

AIM's admission rules provide that if the company has been generating revenue for less than two years, the directors and employees must agree not to sell their interests in the company's shares for at least a year from the date of admission to AIM.  However, AIM will not place any limitations on companies with regard to level of capitalization, length of trading record or the number of publicly held shares.

<p>

An application to AIM must be supported by a prospectus (Admission Document).  The Admission Document will need to comply with the Public Offers of Securities Regulations as well as the rules of AIM.  Included in the Admission Document will be information such as a description of the securities and the company, financial information regarding the company and recent developments and prospects of the company.

<p>

The continuing obligations of AIM are limited almost exclusively to disclosure obligations.  There is a general obligation to announce new developments or changes in the company's performance or financial condition as is also the case for companies whose shares are quoted on the Official List.  There is also a series of specific disclosure obligations regarding certain events and transactions which could be price sensitive such as changes in the shareholdings of directors or other significant shareholders, transactions with a percentage ratio of 10% or more as defined by AIM's rules and transactions with parties affiliated with the company.  There are no rules requiring the consent of shareholders for the company to engage in particular types of transactions, except with regard to a reverse takeover.

<p>

The London Stock Exchange has produced written information regarding AIM.  Titles of such publications include: <EM>Rules for Companies</EM>, <EM>A Guide for Companies</EM>, <EM>A Guide for Investors</EM> and <EM>A Guide for Advisers and Brokers</EM>.  Copies are available from the London office of Faegre & Benson.

<blockquote>

This article was originally published in <EM>Communications Lawyer</EM>, Vol. 12 No. 1 Spring 1994, a publication of the Forum on Communications Law of the American Bar Association.  Copyright &copy; 1994 American Bar Association<br>
<STRONG>Reprinted with Permission</STRONG>.
<p>

Journalists fiercely resist efforts to force disclosure of confidential sources or unpublished information, often to the point of going to jail or paying steep fines as the price of resistance.  On the other hand, many journalists complain, but comply, when confronted with subpoenas to produce published information.  However, journalists in many cases successfully can resist subpoenas even for published or broadcast information.
<P>

Attorneys direct subpoenas to journalists for testimony, videotapes, audiotapes, photographs, notes, outtakes, and other material for one very simple reason:  Journalists have, or are thought to have, information desired by attorneys in criminal cases and civil litigation.  The overwhelming majority of these subpoenas come in cases in which the journalist is not a party, according to surveys conducted by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in 1989 and 1991.<A HREF="#1"><B>1</B></A> 
<P>

The scenario is straightforward:  The nature of news itself means that journalists will seek out, gather, assimilate, and disseminate information involving crime, conflict, and other matters of public interest, many of which lead to criminal cases and civil lawsuits.  In a search for information, witnesses, and documents attorneys in those cases may serve subpoenas upon journalists for a number of reasons:  They do not have the time, resources, or inclination to conduct their own investigations.  They are being extremely thorough and want to exhaust every possible source of information.
<P>

When subpoenas seek confidential sources or unpublished information, journalists usually react immediately, viscerally, violently, and negatively.  These subpoenas threaten the constitutional role of the press in gathering and publishing information to benefit the public generally, as contrasted with the private benefit to parties to a particular lawsuit.  Subpoenas for confidential and unpublished information raise issues of journalists' privileges under federal and state constitutions, statutes, and rules of evidence, which have been explored in many law review articles and elsewhere since <EM>Branzburg v. Hayes</EM>. <a href="#2"><B>2</B></a>
<P>

<h3>Subpoenas for Information</h3>
In contrast, subpoenas for information contained in published articles or broadcast stories do not implicate privilege issues  and have received little attention in the overall discussion of legal discovery against the press. <a href="#3"><B>3</B></a>  However, they account for a significant percentage of the total subpoenas issued against the press.  The 1989 Reporters Committee survey found that nearly half of the subpoenas issued against news organizations were for published items and news organizations fully complied with more than 50 percent of these subpoenas.  Similar results were reported for 1991.  <a href="#4"><B>4</B></a>
<P>

A common attitude appears to be that the press must respond to subpoenas for published or broadcast information and turn over that information (and produce the journalist for testimony, if requested) because the special journalists' privilege does not extend beyond confidential and sometimes unpublished information.  Unfortunately, this attitude ignores the real costs imposed on journalists who comply with subpoenas for published information.  
<P>

Some courts do recognize those costs.  In <EM>Maurice v. NLRB</EM>, a federal judge in West Virginia set aside a subpoena for a business editor to testify concerning a published interview with a coal company executive who was a witness in a labor case, noting:  The impeachment by a reporter of her news source is a serious matter, having a negative impact on the newsgathering abilities of the media as significant as the compelled disclosure by a reporter of a confidential source.<a href="#5"><B>5</B></a>  
<P>

Compelled testimony which entangles reporters in court proceedings, especially high-profile court proceedings, can have additional long-term adverse consequences, as the district court also recognized in <EM>Maurice</EM>.<a href="#6"><B>6</B></a>  Sources who are concerned that the words will haunt them in court are likely to speak to that reporter with less candor.  Furthermore, reporters who become a part of the criminal trial or civil litigation by testifying may be unable to cover new developments in a story they have been following for a long time, either because of ethical constraints or because a party has insisted that the reporter-witness be sequestered until his or her testimony has ended.<a href="#7"><B>7</B></a>
<P>

Moreover, the temporal burdens on the press are considerable.  An Alabama broadcast outlet responded to the 1989 Reporters Committee survey as follows: [A]rchivists must find the material, a newsperson's time must be spent helping to compile scripts, and engineering time is involved in dubbing the material to tape.  The fact that the press by its nature announces to the world that it has information, and the perception among lawyers that the press may have information even if the lawyer has not yet read the particular article or seen the particular broadcast make the press recurring targets of subpoenas to a far greater extent than any other organization.  This problem becomes even greater when the subpoena is directed at the news organization, rather than at a particular reporter, and seeks all information related to a designated subject, instead of a particular article or report.
<P>

Responding to subpoenas diverts time and resources from reporters' real jobs of newsgathering and news-disseminating and imposes costs on the public in the form of delayed or suppressed information.  This diversion might be considered inconsequential in an isolated case, but the cumulative organizational burden cannot be ignored.  As stated in the conclusion to the 1989 Reporters Committee survey:

<blockquote>

<font size=-1>Inevitably, law enforcement officials and litigants seeking information from journalists will continue to argue that a few isolated subpoenas do not pose any real danger to a reporter's ability to effectively gather and disseminate news.  Yet, due to the cumulative impact of repeated subpoenas, an editor's decision whether to cover a controversial story may be motivated as much by the desire to avoid an ongoing battle to keep reporters' testimony and notes out of court as by traditional news judgments.  Until judges understand that, many of them will continue to dismiss the impact of individual requests as trivial.<a href="#8"><B>8</B></a></font>

</blockquote>

Threats of subpoenas, actual or perceived, also have caused some news organizations to discard their notes more frequently than before and to be more reluctant to use confidential sources, according to the 1991 Reporters Committee survey. 
<P>

The New York Court of Appeals recognized the dangers of allowing routine subpoenas against the press in <EM>O'Neill v. Oakgrove Const., Inc.</EM>, 523, stating:

<blockquote>

<font size=-1>The autonomy of the press would be jeopardized if resort to its resource materials, by litigants seeking to utilize the newsgathering efforts of journalists for their private purposes, were routinely permitted.  Moreover, because journalists typically gather information about accidents, crimes, and other matters of special interest that often give rise to litigation, attempts to obtain evidence by subjecting the press to discovery as a nonparty would be widespread if not restricted.  The practical burden on the time and resources, as well as the consequent diversion of journalistic effort and disruption of newsgathering activity, would be particularly inimical to the vigor of a free press.<a href="#9"><B>9</B></a></font>
</blockquote>


Although compliance may be appropriate in individual cases, the pattern of general compliance with subpoenas for published or broadcast material is not justified.  News organizations should not automatically assume that they must comply with subpoenas for published or broadcast information.  Legal arguments exist to resist those subpoenas in many situations.  Although First Amendment reasons do exist for resisting these subpoenas, many arguments can be found in the rules and laws applicable to <EM>all</EM> witnesses.  This approach helps defuse the predictable cry that the press, once again, is seeking an unjustifiable special privilege.
<P>

In criminal cases, a primary defense to subpoenas can be found under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17, under which a subpoena may command a person to appear to give testimony and also to produce designated books, papers, documents, or other objects.  However, the court may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive, if the target of the subpoena makes a prompt motion. 
<P>

The law governing the issuance of a subpoena for documents in a criminal matter was settled, in <EM>United States v. Nixon</EM>.<a href="#10"><B>10</B></a>  The United States Supreme Court held that the party serving the subpoena must show that:  (1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) the documents are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by the exercise of due diligence; (3) the party cannot properly prepare for trial without production and inspection of the documents and failure to obtain the inspection may delay the trial unreasonably; and (4) the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general fishing expedition.<a href="#11"><B>11</B></a>
<p>

Because criminal subpoenas reach only evidentiary and relevant<a href="#12"><B>12</B></a> materials, material held by third-parties (such as news organizations) that does not rise to the dignity of admissible evidence simply is not within the rule.<a href="#13"><B>13</B></a>  A federal judge in Boston denied the government's request to compel production of a television station's videotape containing an interview with a criminal defendant.  The court concluded that it was too early even to conduct its own <EM>in camera</EM> review of the videotape because of the possibility that there might not even be a trial (the defendant might plead guilty or be declared incompetent to stand trial).  The court further stated that if the case did proceed to trial and the government's need for the videotape as evidence actually materialized, it then would weigh the station's First Amendment interests against the needs of the prosecution.<a href="#14"><B>14</B></a>
<P>  

Vaguely worded or exhaustively comprehensive subpoenas may sweep so broadly that they amount to nothing more than an impermissible fishing expedition.<a href="#15"><B>15</B></a>  If the information sought from journalists simply repeats a point made in other admissible evidence, the court may set aside the press subpoena as cumulative.<a href="#16"><b>16</B></a>   
<P>

Unfortunately, a journalist facing a subpoena may not have the factual knowledge of a particular case or the legal background to argue effectively that the information sought in the subpoena is cumulative, irrelevant, unnecessary, or non-evidentiary.  On the other hand, it often is reasonably easy for any journalist, facing a subpoena for published information, to object on the grounds that the requesting attorney could get the same information with little difficulty from another source.<a href="#17"><B>17</B></a>
<P>  
It is hard to believe that any attorney <EM>needs</EM> to subpoena the press for a copy of a published or broadcast story in a country filled with public libraries, computer-assisted research organizations such as Westlaw and NEXIS, private clipping services, and even video clipping services.  It may be cheaper, simpler, or faster for an attorney to grind out a press subpoena than to conduct or pay for independent research, but that is not the same as showing that the materials are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by the exercise of due diligence, as the law requires.
<P>

A 1992 Minnesota case illustrates this point.  The United States Attorney was prosecuting an indigent black man for unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon; he was accused not only of possessing the gun, but also of firing it at two white police officers.  The defendant faced a mandatory fifteen-year sentence without parole, if convicted.  His attorney sought a change of venue, claiming that racial tensions in the city had escalated recently in the wake of the murder of an off-duty white police officer, apparently by black gang members.  To support her motion, the defense attorney served subpoenas on the community's two largest newspapers for copies of all articles which appeared in your publication [during a three-week period], relative to the shooting of [the police officer], including those articles relating to racial tensions stemming from the shooting.<a href="#18"><B>18</B></a>  
<p>

The newspapers resisted, citing Rule 17, and the district court agreed that the subpoenas should be quashed as improper burdens on the newspapers:

<blockquote>

<font size=-1>Appearances by the newspapers are not necessary to authenticate the articles, to the extent they have evidentiary value.  Fed. R. Ev. 902(6).  Insofar as defense counsel seeks to have the newspapers make the search and selection concerning the articles, the subpoenas shift the burden of trial preparation from defense counsel onto the newspapers; no matter what the extent of the newspapers' resources may be relative to the criminal defendant, this sort of burden-shifting is an unfair imposition upon innocent third-parties.<a href="#19"><B>19</B></a></font>
</blockquote>

This passage highlights the next line of defense to subpoenas for testimony of the reporters.  Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, authentication of published articles does not require testimony by the reporter or other representatives of the news organization.  Those materials are self-authenticating under Rule 902(6).<a href="#20"><B>20</B></a>
<p>

The self-authentication rule, of course, applies to evidence in civil as well as criminal cases.  The scope of permissible subpoenas is much broader in civil actions, where subpoenas may issue for discovery purposes, and where the information sought need not itself be admissible evidence so long as it appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Even here, however, the requirement that the information be relevant to the case limits the scope of permissible discovery.  For example, if a news organization receives a third-party subpoena for all documents, including internal reports and memoranda, referring or relating to a particular subject, purely internal documents containing the organization's own use and interpretation of information it has received from a party or from another witness should be irrelevant and non-discoverable.<a href="#21"><B>21</B></a> 
<P>

<h3>Other Provisions from Federal Rules of Civil Procedure May Prevent "One-Stop" Shopping</h3>

The civil rules contain other provisions which should prevent attorneys from making news organizations a sort of one-stop shopping target of subpoenas.  These include:

<UL>
<LI>Rule 26 (b)(1)(i), which permits the court to limit discovery which is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.  The rule does not specify to whom the burden or expense is less.  Because discovery requests to nonparty news organizations impose burdens upon their constitutional rights and public functions, the press can argue that this burden should be given more weight than financial costs and inconveniences of the party seeking discovery.  This argument will be stronger in jurisdictions which recognize a news process basis, rather than a more limited expectation of confidentiality basis, for a journalist's privilege.<a href="#22"><B>22</B></a>  

<LI>Rule 26 (c), which allows the target of the discovery request (including a nonparty, such as a news organization) to seek a protective order.  This could forbid the discovery entirely or specify terms and conditions (such as reimbursement of expenses) under which the discovery may be granted.  The grounds for a protective order include protecting the nonparty from annoyance, ... or undue burden or expense.<a href="#23"><B>23</B></a>

<LI>Rule 45 (c)(1), which affirmatively requires the attorney issuing the subpoena to take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to that subpoena.  Available sanctions against attorneys who violate that rule include, but are not limited to, lost earnings and a reasonable attorney's fee.<a href="#24"><B>24</B></a>

<LI>Rule 45 (c)(2)(B), which provides an inexpensive alternative to the motion for a protective order available under Rule 26.  Persons responding to subpoenas to produce documents, including photographs and videotapes, can deflect the subpoena simply by serving written objection to inspection and copying of the documents.  The burden then falls to the attorney issuing the subpoena to move the court for an order to compel the production.  Any order to compel production shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying commanded.  If this procedure is used, the written objection must be served on the attorney issuing the subpoena within fourteen days after service of the subpoena, or before the time specified for compliance if that time is less than fourteen days after service.

</UL>
		

Rule 45 does not define significant expense.  Where amounts are uncertain, they may be determined after the materials have been produced, provided that the risk of uncertainty is fully disclosed to the discovering party.  These amounts can be substantial.  In one case, nonparties sought to recover $2.3 million in costs allegedly incurred in responding to document requests.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit observed that the requesting parties were on notice throughout the production process that the nonparties intended to seek reimbursement and received periodic status reports of the costs as they were incurred, so that the parties could easily have modified or limited their discovery demands whenever they felt that their exposure to potential reimbursement exceeded the value of requested material.  . . .  Nonparty witnesses are powerless to control the scope of litigation and discovery, and should not be forced to subsidize an unreasonable share of the costs of a litigation to which they are not a party.<a href="#25"><B>25</B></a>   
<p>

<h3>State Court Rules May Help</h3>

The federal rule protects nonparties from incurring significant expense in responding to subpoenas.  State court rules can be more or less protective depending on the jurisdiction.  For example, Iowa's less-protective Civil Rule 155 (c) requires the target of the subpoena to seek a protective order and authorizes protection only if the subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive.  Iowa also allows the target of a subpoena for the production of documents (but not mere testimony) to recover the reasonable cost of producing the records sought.  
<p>

On the more protective end of the spectrum, Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure 45.06 provides that a witness who is not a party to the action or an employee of a party and who is required to give testimony or produce documents relating to a profession, business, or trade. ... is entitled to reasonable compensation for the time and expense involved in preparing for and giving such testimony or producing such documents.  The party serving the subpoena shall make arrangements for such reasonable compensation prior to the time of the taking of such testimony.  This rule leaves no room for the trial court to exercise any discretion in deciding whether to award <EM>some</EM> costs to the witness, although the court does have the power to determine what expenses are reasonable.  
<p>

This sort of provision can deter frivolous subpoenas.  A news director at a television station in Louisiana noted on the 1991 Reporters Committee survey that often individuals are persuaded to withdraw a subpoena because under state law, third parties are entitled to compensation for time and materials being sought."<a href="#26"><B>26</B></a>
<p>

Other news organizations charge hourly fees, with a minimum of $100 or $150, to anyone asking them to search for and produce published or broadcast information.  This policy can deter frivolous requests.  Organizations that follow this approach should be sure that their charges will cover or exceed all of their expenses.
<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
   
These legal arguments against subpoenas are available to anyone, most emphatically <EM>including</EM> news organizations.  They will not turn aside every subpoena for published or broadcast information.  An attorney may need a higher-quality reproduction of a photograph than one available on newsprint, or the parties may refuse to stipulate to the authenticity of a broadcast report, or a witness may deny ever making the damaging admission quoted in a story.<a href="#27"><B>27</B></a>  Such cases are likely to make it worth the fight for the requesting attorney to pursue the subpoena through a court hearing and perhaps even a level or two of appeals.  Other attorneys, motivated more by battle fever or possible publicity than by practicality or economy, may simply relish a fight with the news media.  Some may even use subpoenas as a calculated effort to intimidate the press or to discourage certain types of reporting.
<p>

On the other hand, reasoned and consistent resistance to subpoenas can deflect many requests for information, particularly those from attorneys who served a subpoena against the news media to reduce their own expenses, or who may not have thought about the burden they were putting on the press, or who may not have considered fully just what information they really need and why.  In many instances, deflection may require no more than a short, reasoned letter or telephone call from an editor or press attorney, at minimal cost.  The Reporters Committee surveys found that nearly one in five of all reported subpoenas were withdrawn by the issuing attorney after discussions with an editor or media lawyer, with anecdotal comments confirming the effectiveness of telephone calls.  If this approach fails, the subpoenaed journalist can consider the relative burdens of complying with the subpoena or incurring additional legal costs to challenge the subpoena in court. 
<p>

Of course, news organizations may decide in particular cases not to resist a subpoena for any of a number of reasons.  However, greater awareness of the possibilities for objecting to subpoenas, even routine subpoenas seeking publicly available published or broadcast information, at least should reduce any sense of fatalistic resignation that led to the high level of compliance found in the Reporters Committee surveys.
<p>

The Reporters Committee surveys confirm the effectiveness of challenges to subpoenas' even when the challenges are not based on state shield laws or a constitutional reporters privilege.  Of the relatively few subpoenas actually challenged in court, judges quashed nearly three out of four.  Courts that blocked subpoenas frequently did so on the grounds that the information sought was available from other sources, that the information sought was irrelevant or not needed, and that the subpoenas were overly broad.<a href="#28"><B>28</B></a>

In Florida v. Kangus, 8 Med. L. Rptr. 2045 (Fla. Cty.

<p>

Unless they can establish either constitutional actual malice or actual damage to reputation, persons suing for defamation in Minnesota cannot recover damages for emotional distress, the Minnesota Supreme Court held on February 23, 1996.
<p>
The court's decision in <EM>Richie v. Paramount Pictures Corp.</EM>, <A HREF="richey.html"> Nos. CX-94-2249 and C5-94-2501, [click here for full text]</A> reverses a 1995 decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals and reinstates 1994 trial court orders granting summary judgment to all defendants.  The pictures of plaintiffs James Richie and Karen Gerten had been mistakenly shown during a syndicated television talk show and identified as the images of the parents of a young woman whose father had sexually abused her for years while her mother did nothing to prevent the abuse.  They claimed that they were shocked and crushed by the telecast, and that they continually wondered if people were staring at them because they had seen the Show.
<p>

The Supreme Court summarized its own decision in these words:  We have determined that it would violate the First Amendment to allow Gerten and Richie to recover based on presumed damage to their reputations.  We have also held that respondents' defamation claim cannot succeed based only on humiliation or other types of emotional harm.  Thus, respondents must be able to show actual harm to their reputations.  Because the trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that neither Gerten nor Richie suffered actual harm to their reputations, we hold that neither Gerten nor Richie's defamation action can succeed.
<p>

In other significant parts of the <EM>Richie</EM> decision, the Supreme Court:
<UL>
<LI>Held that plaintiffs had not presented evidence of actual harm to reputation, despite testimony that their friends and family members had inquired about the telecast and that, a year after the telecast, a normally friendly employee at a fast-food restaurant served Richie three raw hamburgers.
<LI>In direct reversal of the Court of Appeals, held that the requirement of demonstrating actual injury to reputation applied at the summary judgment stage, and not just at trial.
<LI>In its first direct ruling on the question since <EM>Hendry v. Conner</EM>, 226 N.W.2d 921 (Minn. 1975), confirmed Minnesota's rejection of any cause of action for invasion of privacy.
<LI>Held that the same defamation rules apply to individuals who communicate through the news media as apply to the news media themselves.
<LI>Held that discussions of the sexual abuse of children by their parents and legal recourse available to the abused child are certainly of public concern.
</UL>


<STRONG>National background and perspective</STRONG><p>

<EM>Richie</EM> illustrates the continuing ripple effects upon state defamation law created by <EM>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.</EM>, 418 U.S. 323 (1974), and by its superimposition of federal constitutional principles on state law.
<p>

At common law, plaintiffs in cases of slander per se or libel benefitted from a legal rule that the words used were so likely to cause harm that plaintiffs did not have to present any evidence at all of actual injury, although they could increase their odds of a substantial recovery if they did offer proof.  Emotional distress damages -- such as wounded feelings, mental anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, and resulting physical pain and illness -- could be recovered in addition to harm to reputation.  Damages for both harm to reputation and emotional distress in these cases were presumed from the fact of publication and the nature of the words used.
<p>

In slander cases that did not fall into one of the slander per se categories (accusations of a crime, statements impugning someone in their business or trade, accusations of loathsome disease, or imputing sexual unchastity to a woman), special damages had to be pleaded and proven before the action could proceed.  The point was to prevent courts from being overwhelmed, and speech from being silenced, by lawsuits whenever a communication wounded the feelings of its subject.
<p>

For example, in <EM>Terwilliger v. Wands</EM>, 17 N.Y. 54 (1858), a farmer was wrongfully accused of repeatedly engaging in illicit sexual intercourse with a married woman.  He fell into deep melancholy, but the courts refused to allow him to pursue a slander claim based solely upon his mental distress and resulting physical suffering.  New York's highest court held:  It is injuries affecting the reputation only which are the subject of the action.  * * *  Where there is no proof that the character has suffered from the words, if sickness results it must be attributed to apprehension of loss of character, and such fear of harm to character, with resulting sickness and bodily prostration, cannot be such special damage as the law requires for the action.
<p>

In 1974, the United States Supreme Court exploded the whole field of presumed damages in defamation cases, holding in <EM>Gertz</EM> as a matter of First Amendment law that unless they proved intentional falsehood or reckless disregard for truth or falsity (that is, actual malice in the constitutional sense first used in <EM>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</EM>, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)), defamation plaintiffs in cases involving matters of public concern could recover only actual damages supported by adequate evidence of actual harm, and could not rely upon the common-law doctrine of presumed damages.  The court did not define actual damages, but did list customary types of harm compensable in defamation actions, including out-of-pocket losses, impairment of reputation, and mental anguish.
<p>

Two years later, in a case arising in Florida, the court allowed recovery in a defamation action based solely on mental anguish.  The plaintiff in <EM>Time, Inc. v. Firestone</EM>, 424 U.S. 448 (1976), had abandoned all claims for damage based on injury to reputation, but received $100,000 for her mental distress from the magazine's misdescription of the grounds for her divorce.  Firestone thus made clear that there was no constitutional bar to recvovery for a defamation claim based solely on emotional damages.
<p>

<EM>Firestone</EM>'s result came in for considerable criticism by legal commentators, who pointed out that the traditional purpose of defamation law was to provide a remedy for injury to reputation, and not to salve tender feelings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, Anderson, <EM>Reputation, Compensation, and Proof</EM>, 25 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 747, 749 (1984); Ashdown, <EM>Of Public Figures and Public Interest -- the Libel Law Conundrum</EM>, 25 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 937, 948 (1984); Eaton, <EM>The American Law of Defamation Through </EM>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. <EM>and Beyond:  An Analytical Primer</EM>, 61 Va. L. Rev. 1349, 1438-1439 (1975); Keeton, <EM>Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts</EM> 844-845 (5th ed. 1984); R. Smolla, <EM>The Law of Defamation</EM>, § 9.06[4][b] (Release #6, 1/93).  But that was now an issue for each state to determine under its own law.
<p>

States reacted differently.  Some declined to limit defamation plaintiffs to any particular type of damage, and allowed recoveries based solely on emotional distress.  E.g., <EM>Keohane v. Stewart</EM>, 882 P.2d 1293, 1304 n.16 (Colo. 1994); <EM>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Ane</EM>, 458 So.2d 239 (Fla. 1984); <EM>Hearst Corp. v. Hughes</EM>, 297 Md. 112, 466 A.2d 486 (1983).
<p>

Other jurisdictions required defamation plaintiffs to prove reputational harm before they could recover emotional distress damages.  <EM>E.g.</EM>, <EM>Garziano v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co.</EM>, 818 F.2d 380, 395 (5th Cir. 1987) (applying Mississippi law); <EM>Little Rock Newspapers, Inc. v. Dodrill</EM>, 660 S.W.2d 933, 936-937 (Ark. 1983); <EM>Cua v. Ramos</EM>, 418 N.E.2d 1163, 1167 (Ind. App. 1981), <EM>affd.</EM>, 433 N.E.2d 745, 749 (Ind. 1982); <EM>Gobin v. Globe Publishing Co.</EM>, 649 P.2d 1239, 1243 (Kan. 1982).  
<p>

New York courts were among the first to take this approach of requiring proof of harm to reputation, <EM>France v. St. Clare's Hospital and Health Ctr.</EM>, 82 A.D.2d 1, 441 N.Y.S.2d 79 (N.Y. App. Div. 1981); <EM>Salomone v. McMillan Publishers, Inc.</EM>, 77 A.D.2d 501, 429 N.Y.S.2d 441 (N.Y. App. Div. 1980), although two later cases raised some uncertainty, see <EM>Matherson v. Marchello</EM>, 100 A.D.2d 233, 473 N.Y.S.2d 998 (N.Y. App. Div. 1984); <EM>Hogan v. Herald Co.</EM>, 84 A.D.2d 470, 446 N.Y.S.2d 836 (N.Y. App. Div.), <EM>affd.</EM>, 444 N.E.2d 1002 (N.Y. 1982).  But see <EM>Dalbec v. Gentlemen's Companion, Inc.</EM>, 828 F.2d 921, 926-927 (2d Cir. 1987) (New York does not permit compensatory damages to be recovered absent proof of injury to reputation or malice.).
<p>

Arguably internally conflicting decisions also could be found in Texas.  <EM>See Finklea v. Jacksonville Daily Progress</EM>, 742 S.W.2d 512, 516-517 (Tex. App. 1987, writ dism'd w.o.j.), <EM>distinguishing Outlet Co. v. International Security Group, Inc.</EM>, 693 S.W.2d 621 (Tex. App. 1985, writ ref. n.r.e.).  <EM>See generally</EM>, Anno., <EM>Proof of Injury to Reputation as Prerequisite to Recovery of Damages in Defamation Actions -- Post-</em>Gertz <em>Cases</EM>, 36 ALR 4th 807 (1985).   
<p>

In 1987, Minnesota appeared to take a permissive approach, allowing presumed general damages (including mental distress, with no proof of actual harm to reputation) based on a defamation per se claim.  <EM>Becker v. Alloy Hardfacing & Engineering Co.</EM>, 401 N.W.2d 655, 661 (Minn. 1987).  That case, however, involved a private plaintiff suing a private defendant on a matter that was not of public concern; it was a dispute between an individual and his former employer.  This type of defamation is not subject to First Amendment limitations.  <EM>Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.</EM>, 472 U.S. 749 (1985).  Thus, the impact of <EM>Gertz</EM> was yet to be felt.
<p>
		
<STRONG>The history of <EM>Richie</EM></STRONG>
<P>

The November 5, 1992, telecast of the Maury Povich Show, a nationally syndicated talk show, contained an interview with Denise Richie.  Ms. Richie described her trauma from years of sexual abuse by her father, while her mother did nothing to stop the abuse.  Not only had her father been criminally convicted for the abuse, but Ms. Richie had obtained a civil trial judgment against both of her parents.  
<P>

As part of the background to be presented during the interview, the Show asked for a picture of Denise's parents.  Kathy Tatone, who represented Denise in her civil suit and acted as her representative in dealing with the Show, provided a photograph of Denise standing between a man and a woman.  Ms. Tatone identified the persons in the photograph as Denise's parents.  Based upon this assurance from an apparently knowledgeable and reliable source, the Show's producers used the picture at several points during the interview (Povich himself was not aware of the photograph being used).  The names of Denise's parents -- Dennis and Lanell -- were mentioned more than once during the Show.  Unfortunately, the photograph used on the Show actually depicted Denise with her godparents, who were her paternal uncle, James Richie, and her maternal aunt, Karen Gerten -- a fact not made known to the Show until after the program had been broadcast.  The mistake surprised everyone.
<p>

Neither Karen Gerten nor James Richie saw their pictures used during the original telecast, but each learned of the Show from family or friends and eventually watched a videotape of the interview.  Each received a few inquiries or comments from family and friends registering either curiosity or sympathy about their inclusion in the Show.
<p>

In May 1993, Mr. Richie and Ms. Gerten brought claims for defamation and for false light invasion of privacy against attorney Tatone, Paramount Pictures (which produced the Show), MoPo Productions (which supplied the services of host Maury Povich), and Hubbard Broadcasting (which owned and operated the Minnesota station that broadcast the Show locally, and was dismissed by stipulation early in the case).  Each plaintiff testified to personal distress from the situation.  Ms. Gerten was embarrassed, got butterflies in her stomach, and became cautious about going places and doing things.  She may have looked tired, but displayed no other outward signs of her distress.  She did not seek counselling or treatment for her distress.  James Richie said he felt sick when he watched the videotape.  He testified that he was shocked, stunned and humiliated, and that he has a certain amount of paranoia about how others treat him, and has occasional difficulty sleeping and occasional upset stomach.  He did not seek any professional therapy.    
<p>

More than a year after the telecast, neither plaintiff could identify a single person, at work or in their community, who saw the Show, recognized plaintiffs, and believed that James Richie or Karen Gerten had abused Denise Richie or had approved of that abuse.  Plaintiffs incurred no special damages as a result of the broadcast in question and suffered no injury to reputation.  Both admitted that they cannot point to any specific evidence that [my] reputation has been affected by the broadcast of the picture on the show.
<p>

All defendants moved for summary judgment at the close of discovery in 1994, arguing privilege, lack of fault, and plaintiffs' lack of reputational injury.  Minnesota district court judge Robert G. Schiefelbein granted defendants' motions for summary judgment on the grounds that defamation plaintiffs in Minnesota cannot recover damages based only on evidence of emotional distress, in rulings on July 12 and November 17, 1994.  Plaintiffs appealed.
<p>

On May 30, 1995, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals agreed with the district court and with defendants that the primary purpose of defamation actions is to impose liability on a defendant for injuries to reputation and that [d]amages for emotional distress can be recovered, but only when the plaintiff has established a valid claim for defamation.  <EM>Richie v. Paramount Pictures Corp.</EM>, 532 N.W.2d 235, 240 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995).  However, it reversed the summary judgment on the grounds that the seriousness of the statements allowed [a]t least some' actual injury to ... reputation[] [to] be assumed  --  at least for purposes of withstanding a motion for summary judgment.  (The judgment dismissing the false light invasion of privacy claim remained undisturbed on appeal, due to plaintiffs' failure to pursue the issue.) 
<p>

In dissent, Judge Davies warned that by permitting plaintiffs to survive summary judgment without producing evidence of harm to their reputations, the majority was inadvisably relying on the assumptions of the doctrine of defamation per se to open the door to emotional distress damages; he wrote that, particularly in a case such as this, where the Show correctly identified the actual offenders by name, plaintiffs should have been required to produce evidence that <EM>someone</EM> actually mistakenly understood them to have been Denise Richie's parents.  
<p>

All defendants petitioned for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, specifying the issues on which the Court of Appeals had reversed the grant of summary judgment.  Plaintiffs opposed the petition for review, but did not file a conditional petition for review on that part of the decision holding that plaintiffs at trial must show that their reputations have suffered, and that, if they do not, they should not recover damages under their claims for defamation.  The Minnesota Supreme Court granted the defendants' petitions for review on July 20, 1995, heard oral arguments on December 5, 1995, and issued its decision reinstating the summary judgments on February 23, 1996. 
<p>

The court acknowledged that it had never squarely addressed the issue of whether Minnesota allowed defamation claims based exclusively on mental anguish and humiliation, distinguishing its earlier decision in <EM>Becker</EM> because that case had not involved the First Amendment limitations of <EM>Gertz</EM>.  It opted to impose the reputational-injury requirement for three reasons.
<p>

First, it pointed out Minnesota's historical acknowledgement of the purpose of defamation actions as compensating private individuals for wrongful injury to reputation.  Similar historical statements of purpose can be found in decisions of many other state courts.  E.g., Greenlee v. Coffman, 171 N.W. 580, 581 (Ia. 1919).
<p>

Second, the Minnesota Supreme Court noted that it has exercised historical caution regarding emotional distress claims' and saw nothing inherent in defamation claims that should inhibit that caution.
<p>

Third, it noted that while defamation claims focus upon injury to reputation, invasion of privacy torts compensate for mental distress.  It reasoned that allowing emotional harm to form the basis for liability in a defamation action would be the practical equivalent of allowing a plaintiff to bring an invasion of privacy claim.  That, in turn, would have been inconsistent with the Minnesota Supreme Court's longstanding rejection of invasion of privacy claims.  (Even in states that recognize invasion of privacy claims, media counsel could argue for the same result of requiring reputational injury in defamation actions, in order to preserve the distinction between the two legal theories.)

<h2>IRS Issues Proposed Regs 
on Gift Substantiation</H2>
<h4>by</h4>

<h4>J. Hazen Graves and John E. Harris</h4>


<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Internal Revenue Service has published proposed regulations interpreting  the 1993 tax laws requiring that charitable contributions be documented in a certain  manner.                                                                               
<br>
                                  
The proposed regulations are likely to be revised before they become final, but they do provide some helpful guidance as to the IRSs current thinking on the gift substantiation requirements. 
<p>
<strong>Current Law</strong>
<br>
                                                     
The law now provides that a donor who intends to claim a deduction for a charitable gift of $250 or more must obtain a written receipt from the charity stating (a) the amount of the gift if in cash, or a description of any non-cash gift, and (b) whether the donor received any benefits in exchange for the gift, and if so, a description and estimate of the value of such benefits.
<br>
                                  
For contributions of $75 or more, where the donor receives something of value in exchange for the contribution (a quid pro quo gift), the charity must provide the donor with a written acknowledgement estimating the value of the benefits provided to the donor, and stating that the donors tax deduction is limited to the amount by which the contribution exceeds the value of the benefits. 
<p>
Here are some of the highlights of the proposed regulations:                      
<br>
<UL>
                                                                        
<LI><STRONG>Intent to Make Gift:</STRONG>  A charitable deduction is available only if the amount of  the payment exceeds the value of any benefits received in return, and the donor intended to make a gift.  This may be an issue, for example, at a charity auction, where items are purchased for prices above market value.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Membership Benefits:</STRONG>  In determining whether a donor received anything of value in exchange for the gift, a membership benefit may be disregarded if--

<UL>

-	The payment is $75 or less, and
<br>
-	The benefit consists of--
</ul>
Free admission to members-only events and the charitys costs per person (per event) will not be more than $6.60 (adjusted annually for inflation); or
<br>
Privileges that members can exercise frequently during the membership period (such as free admission to a museum or gift shop discounts).
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Benefits to Donors Employees:</STRONG>  Any benefits that may be disregarded when provided directly to the donor (such as free museum admission) may also be disregarded when provided to the donors employees.  The acknowledgement provided to the donor must describe all other benefits provided to employees, but need not give an estimate of the value of the benefits described.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Valuation of Benefits:</STRONG>  In estimating the value of benefits provided to donors, if the goods or services are not available commercially, the valuation may be based on the value of similar goods or services that are sold commercially, even if the commercial goods or services do not have the unique qualities of those provided by the charity.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Celebrities:</STRONG>  The celebrity status of a person providing a service to the donor is deemed not to add any value to the service.  For example, a round of golf with Bob Hope has no more value than a round of golf with John Doe, for these purposes.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Charitable Remainder Trusts:</STRONG> No acknowledgement is required for contributions to charitable remainder trusts or charitable lead trusts.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Out-of-Pocket Expenses:</STRONG>  Out-of-pocket expenditures of $250 or more incurred in connection with volunteer service will be deductible if substantiated by the volunteers normal records (receipts, cancelled checks, etc.) and an abbreviated written acknowledgement from the charity. The acknowledgement must contain the following information:
<br>
<ul>
-	A description of the services provided by the volunteer
<br>
-	The date the services were provided
<br>
-	Whether or not the volunteer received any benefits in return, and if so, a description of the benefits and an estimate of their value
</ul>
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Gifts from Partnerships, S-Corporations:</STRONG>  A single acknowledgment is to be provided to the partnership or S-corporation, even though each partner or shareholder will be claiming the contribution deduction.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Matching Gifts:</STRONG>  Where a taxpayer receives a benefit from a charity as a result of a matching gift made to the charity by another party, the entire value of the benefit must be reflected in the acknowledgment provided to the recipient of the benefit.
<p>
<LI><STRONG>Effective Date:</STRONG>  The proposed regulations are just that--proposed.  If final regulations are adopted, taxpayers will be able to rely on the regulations for all contributions made on or after January 1, 1994. Written comments on the proposed regulations will be considered by the IRS, and a public hearing will be held in Washington, D.C., on November 1, 1995.

<H2>Thousands Become Defendants in Gift Annuity Lawsuit
</H2><P>

<h4>by</h4>

<h4>J. Hazen Graves</h4>


<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>f your organization has issued charitable gift annuities, you most likely are well aware of the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Texas against The American Council on Gift Annuities, some 21 other charities, and all others similarly situated.  (Ozee et al. v. The American Council on Gift Annuities, Inc., et al.)<P>

In an order dated October 25, 1995, the judge approved the creation of an entire class of charities, likely to number in the thousands, that are now defendants in the lawsuit.  If your organization receives a notice that it is a defendant in this case, do not ignore it!<P>

The lawsuit has been brought by several Texas residents who claim (among many other things) that charities across the country have violated federal and Texas antitrust laws by issuing charitable gift annuities using the payment rates published by The American Council on Gift Annuities, formerly known as the Committee on Gift Annuities.  The plaintiffs allege that use of the published rates constituted price-fixing that violated the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and Texas antitrust laws.<P>

<strong>Class Action</strong><br>

The suit has been structured as both a plaintiff class action and a defendant class action.  Plaintiff class actions are relatively common, and allow a small number of plaintiffs to sue on behalf of all other persons who are similarly situated.  Defendant class actions are quite rare, and permit a plaintiff to pursue claims against a large group of similarly situated defendants by suing only a few members of the group who are representative of all of them.  As a result, a member of the defendant class could be found liable in a lawsuit in which it did not actively participate.<P>

In the October 25 order, the court certified the defendant antitrust class, including as defendants in the lawsuit all organizations meeting both of the following criteria:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The organization is or was a sponsor or member of The American Council on Gift Annuities (or an affiliate of such a sponsor or member).
<LI>During the period December 30, 1990, to the present the organization had outstanding gift annuities or other life income products pursuant to the rates of return published by the Council.
</UL>


If your organization meets these criteria, it is a defendant in this lawsuit unless it opts out as described below.  The American Council on Gift Annuities, Concordia Lutheran College, The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, The Lutheran Foundation of Texas, and the Texas District Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, have been designated by the court as the representatives who will defend the antitrust claims on behalf of the defendant class.  Other members of the defendant class may choose to be represented by their own legal counsel if they desire.<P>

The court has also certified the plaintiff antitrust class, which includes all persons in the United States who, at any time since December 30, 1990, have owned gift annuities issued by members of the defendant antitrust class based on the published annuity rates.  As a result, charities and their donors are placed at odds with each other in the suit.  <P>

<strong>Potential Liability</strong><br>

The prospect of being a defendant in a lawsuit where you are not personally represented is not appealing.  It is made even less appealing in this case because of the damages provisions of the federal antitrust laws that will apply if the defendants are found liable:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Damages will be set at three times the amount of actual damages proven by the plaintiffs.
<LI>Defendants will also be liable for the plaintiffs attorneys fees and expenses.
<LI>Liability is joint and several, so that the plaintiffs may attempt to collect the entire liability of all defendants from a few deep pocket defendants.
<LI>Defendants who are forced to pay such damages generally have no right to charge other non-paying defendants for their fair share of the damages. 
</UL>


Under the rules of procedure, members of the defendant class may opt out of the class, meaning that they would not be governed by any judgment in this lawsuit.  They would, however, then be exposed to the risk of individual lawsuits against them, which the plaintiffs attorneys reportedly have vowed to pursue.  <P>

If a defendant does not opt out, and if a plaintiff attempts to enforce a judgment against that defendant, the defendant most likely would be entitled to a hearing to determine whether there were any material facts or defenses unique to that defendant that had not been addressed at trial.<P>

<strong>Legislation Pending</strong><br>

Some relief may be in sight for defendant charities.  Legislation has been introduced in both the U.S. House and the Senate that would exempt most charities from federal antitrust laws.  The exemption would apply in all lawsuits pending on or after enactment of the law, although retroactive application may be subject to challenge.  The exemption would apply to state antitrust laws as well, except where the state legislature affirmatively voted to keep its antitrust laws applicable to charitable gift programs.  The legislation appears to have strong support in Congress and is moving forward.  It may, however, encounter procedural snags in this contentious session.<P>

<strong>In the Meantime</strong><br>

In the meantime, defendants in the Ozee case may receive demands to produce documents and provide other information to the plaintiffs' attorneys.  Before responding to such demands, it is important that each organization carefully consider several questions, including the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Does the court in Texas have jurisdiction over the organization?
<LI>Should the organization opt out of the defendant class?
<LI>If the court ruled against the defendant antitrust class, would there be any material facts or defenses unique to the organization?  

</UL>

<strong>Planning
</strong><br>

Finally, organizations that are issuing gift annuities using rates that are in any way based on those published by The American Council on Gift Annuities should determine whether their policies or practices should be revised in any way to reduce the risk of future litigation and liability.<P>

This <EM>Alert</EM> is intended solely to alert readers to legal issues relating to nonprofit organizations and is not intended as legal advice.  Further details may be necessary for a complete understanding of the information in this <EM>Alert</EM>. <P>

<H2>Intermediate Sanctions Pass Congress
</H2><P>

<h4>by</h4>

<h4>Thomas S. Schroeder</h4>

<FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>n July 30, President Clinton is signed into law the Tax Payer Bill of Rights 2 bill containing, among things, provisions that allow the Internal Revenue Service to impose financial penalties on managers of exempt organizations and insiders who engage in transactions resulting in private inurement.  The penalties, commonly referred to as intermediate sanctions, provide the IRS with a long-sought enforcement mechanism short of exemption revocationa catastrophic, and in most cases, politically unacceptable, result.  The new law also requires that public charities provide a copy of their IRS Form 990 to anyone who requests one, and it increases the penalties for late filing of Form 990.<P>

Despite drawing support from both the public and private sectors, the intermediate sanctions provisions fell hostage to months of disagreement between the President and Congress over how best to balance the federal budget and, more recently, whether to raise the minimum wage.  Exempt organizations now need to act quickly to ensure that they are not among its first targets, especially in light of the laws retroactive reach to include transactions occurring on or after September 14, 1995.  <P>

<strong>Taxes on Excess Benefit Transactions</strong><br>

The new law creates a two-tiered system of penalty taxes in cases where an organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code engages in an excess benefit transaction.  In such a case, the IRS could impose taxes of up to 200% on disqualified persons (primarily insiders and their relatives) who improperly benefit from an excess benefit transaction, and a 10% tax on organization managers who take part in the transaction knowing that it is improper.  The law does not impose any tax on the exempt organization itself.<P>

The law defines an excess benefit transaction as: (1) any transaction in which an economic benefit is provided to, or for the use of, any disqualified person if the value of the economic benefit exceeds the value of consideration (including performance of services) received by the organization; and (2) any transaction in which the amount of any economic benefit provided to, or for the use of, any disqualified person is determined in whole or in part by the revenues of the organization, provided that the transaction constitutes prohibited inurement under present law.  Excess benefit transactions include transactions in which a disqualified person engages in a non-fair-market-value transaction with an organization or receives unreasonable compensation.  The new law effectively extends private inurement prohibitions to social welfare organizations that are exempt under section 501(c)(4)organizations which until now had operated without any specific prohibitions against private inurement.<p>

<strong>Managers and Insiders Targeted </strong><br>

The law defines disqualified person to include any individual who is in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the organization, or any individual who was in such a position within the five-year period preceding the challenged transaction.  This definition includes not only officers and directors of public charities, hospitals, and such 501(c)(4) organizations as HMOs, but may also include private physicians serving on hospital medical staffs.  In addition, the law defines disqualified persons to include spouses, siblings, children, grandchildren, the spouses of children and grandchildren, and entities in which disqualified persons own more than 35% of the voting power or beneficial interest.<P>

The organization managers subject to the penalty tax include any officers, directors, or trustees of 501(c)(3) or (c)(4) organizations, or any individual[s] having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers, directors, or trustees of the organization.  Presumably, any exempt organization employee who has the authority to approve or otherwise participate in transactions providing excess benefits to insiders may be subject to the tax, regardless of his or her official title or position. <P>

Previous versions of the intermediate sanctions bill had contained a statutory safe harbor which established a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness if the challenged transaction was approved by an independent board that relied upon appropriate comparability data (e.g., data concerning the compensation levels paid by similarly situated organizations) and if the board adequately documented the basis for its determination.  Although this safe harbor was deleted in the final version of the bill passed by Congress, it is expected to resurface in the new laws implementing regulations expected to be issued by the Treasury Department.<p>

<strong>Two-Tiered Penalties are Retroactive</strong><br>

The sanctions provided under the new law are analogous to the excise taxes currently imposed for excess lobbying activities and those that apply to private foundations.   The intermediate sanctions law imposes a tax equal to 25% of the amount of the excess benefit on the disqualified person who receives the benefit.  The excess benefit is equal to the amount by which the transaction price differs from fair market value, the amount of compensation exceeding reasonable compensation, or the amount of a prohibited transaction based on the organizations gross or net income.  Managers of organizations who participate in an excess benefit transaction knowing that the transaction is not reasonable are personally liable for a penalty tax of 10% of the amount of the excess benefit, subject to a maximum penalty of $10,000.  <P>

If the excess benefit transaction is not corrected within a specified time period (either before the mailing of a notice of deficiency or before the date on which the intermediate sanction is assessed, whichever is earlier), second-tier taxes can be imposed on the disqualified person equal to 200% of the amount of excess benefit. <P>

In one of the more surprising provisions of the law, taxable organizations which were formerly tax-exempt can be subject to intermediate sanctions where private benefit or inurement occurred during their exempt years.  Specifically, the law provides that an organization will be treated as an applicable tax-exempt organization subject to the excise taxes if, <EM>at any time during the five-year period proceeding the transaction</EM>, it was a 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) exempt organization.  This provision, along with the provision making intermediate sanctions applicable to transactions occurring <EM>on or after September 14, 1995</EM>, may come as a surprise even to those in the industry who were tracking the legislation.  Previous versions of the bill had provided for a two-year, rather than a five-year, reach over formerly exempt organizations.<p>

<strong>Additional Disclosure Requirements and Penalties</strong><br>

The Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 also includes provisions requiring additional public disclosures and imposing increased penalties for failure to allow public inspection or file timely returns.  Specifically, exempt organizations must now provideincluding by mail, if requestedcopies of their annual returns and exemption applications to those who request them.  These disclosure requirements are in addition to the requirements under the present law (codified at Internal Revenue Code section 6104(e)) that organizations make their annual returns and exemption applications available for inspection at their principal office, including regional or district offices.  The new law prohibits organizations from charging more than a reasonable fee for copying and mailing costs.<P>

The law also increases the penalties for willful violation of the disclosure requirements from $1,000 to $5,000.  Moreover, the penalties for failure to file timely annual returns are increased from $10 per day to $20 per day, up to an new maximum penalty of $10,000 or the lesser of 5% of the organizations annual gross receipts.  If the organization has gross receipts in excess of $1,000,000, the penalties are $100 per day up to a maximum of $50,000.<P>

 The intermediate sanctions law provides the IRS with a far more practical tool than exemption revocation for policing abuses of the charities laws.  By the same token, the new law significantly expands the exposure of tax-exempt organization insiders to potential sanctions (albeit less devastating than exemption revocation) based upon criteria which the IRS and Treasury Department have yet to fully clarify.  Moreover, the law raises new questions, such as how expansively the definition of disqualified person will be read by enforcement officials, and whether those officials will deem incentive-based compensation reasonable under any circumstances.  While no clear answers to these questions exist at present, it is clear that exempt organizations need to carefully review all transactions with insiders, and should document their compensation decisions and other insider transactions as thoroughly as possible.

<H2>IRS Issues Final Section 162(m) Regulations</H2>

<H4>by</H4>

<h4>Peter J. Withoff</h4>

<p>

Continuing its practice of providing December guidance on Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), the IRS issued final section 162(m) Regulations (Final Regulations) on December 20, 1995.  Section 162(m) was originally added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and denies deductions by publicly held corporations for compensation paid to covered employees in excess of  $1 million.  The $1 million limit is subject to certain exceptions, by far the most significant of which is the exception for performance-based compensation.  Proposed Regulations were originally issued in December, 1993 and modified significantly in December, 1994.  Now, the section 162(m) Regulations have been issued as final Regulations.

<P>

Fortunately, the Final Regulations contain few surprises.  While the Final Regulations clarify a few additional items, they extensively follow the prior versions of the Proposed Regulations.  Of perhaps greatest significance, the transitional rules that were offered in the Proposed Regulations are now contained in the Final Regulations.

<P>

The Final Regulations clarify the treatment of award pools that some taxpayers maintain.  Under an award pool, the corporation creates an award pool, the size of which is dependent on achieving certain performance targets.  Individual participants are then given a percentage interest in the pool.  Some taxpayers had awarded percentage interests exceeding 100% of the pool, but then retained the flexibility to exercise negative discretion to reduce awards at the end of the year to the 100% level (or lower).  The Final Regulations conclude that this type of arrangement is not permissible.  The award percentages may not exceed 100% in the aggregate, and a reduction in one employee's bonus may not increase any other employee's bonus.  Recognizing that this conclusion was not obvious under the Proposed Regulations, the IRS granted transitional relief to taxpayers with a pre-existing impermissible award pool arrangement.  No additional guidance is provided on the permissible exercise of negative discretion.  This will continue to be a troublesome issue as taxpayers and the IRS attempt to define the difference between permissible negative discretion and impermissible non-performance based compensation. 

<P>

The Final Regulations also clarify the treatment of dividend equivalents paid with respect to unexercised stock options.  If such payments are not contingent upon exercise of the stock option, they will not taint an otherwise qualified performance based option.  On the other hand, if the employee's right to receive the dividend equivalents is contingent upon exercise of the option, the dividend equivalents are treated as a net reduction in the option price, causing the entire option to be treated as non-performance based.

<P>

Other issues that are dealt with in the Final Regulations are of much more limited applicability and include certain technical issues dealing with former officers of previously affiliated entities, companies that become publicly traded without an initial public offering, awards that are based on a percentage of salary, and special binding contract exclusions.

<P>

The Final Regulations continue to permit performance criteria to be described to shareholders in very general terms.  However, if the compensation committee retains the flexibility to set the actual targets under an approved performance goal without disclosing such targets to shareholders, the Final Regulations provide that shareholder approval must be obtained every five years.  This approval period is substantially shorter than the ten year period allowed for other tax-oriented compensation programs such as incentive stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans.  Since virtually all section 162(m) plans take advantage of the flexibility allowed under the Final Regulations not to disclose specific performance targets, shareholder reapproval generally will be required at five year intervals. 

<P>

In addition, the Final Regulations continue to maintain the distinction between an outside director for section 162(m) purposes and a disinterested director for securities law purposes.  For example, a former officer can never be an outside director but could be a disinterested director.  The definition of outside director also contains much more stringent limitations on directors who indirectly receive compensation from the publicly held corporation, including compensation received as an employee of certain entities doing business with the publicly held corporation.  While these distinctions are supportable under the legislative history to section 162(m), the statutory language does not require such distinctions.  It would have been helpful if the Final Regulations had broadened the definition of outside director to include any person who is a disinterested director for securities law purposes.

<P>

The finalization of the section 162(m) Regulations will hopefully bring some stability to this area of the law.  While unanswered questions remain, taxpayers will now have the benefit of final Regulations on which to rely.

TOMLJANOVICH</strong>, Justice.
<p>

James Richie and Karen Gerten commenced this action in May of 1993 alleging defamation and false light invasion of privacy. These charges were based upon a photograph shown during the November 5, 1992 telecast of The Maury Povich Show (the Show), a nationally syndicated television program.  Appellant, Paramount Pictures Corp. (Paramount), produced the Show and employed the personnel who obtained the photograph and incorporated it into the Show.  Appellant, Kathy Tatone, provided the photograph to the Show.  Appellant, MoPo Productions Inc. (MoPo), provided the services of host Maury Povich to the Show, but Povich himself was not aware that a photograph was being used in connection with the segment of the Show in question.<A HREF="#1"><B><SMALL>1</SMALL></B></A> 
<p>

On July 12, 1994, Hennepin County District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Paramount and MoPo on both the defamation and privacy claims.  On November 17, 1994, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Tatone on both claims.  However, on May 30, 1995, the court of appeals reversed the trial court and remanded the case for trial.  <EM>Richie v. Paramount Pictures Corp.</EM>, 532 N.W.2d 235 (Minn. App. 1995).  This court granted review on July 20, 1995.
<p>

In September of 1992, attorney Kathy Tatone represented Denise Richie in a successful civil case against her parents arising out of sexual abuse by Denise's father, Dennis Richie.  Denise also obtained a favorable verdict against her mother, Lynnell (also spelled Lanell) Richie, for negligently failing to take any action to prevent the abuse.
<p>

Following the verdict, a producer for the Maury Povich Show contacted Tatone regarding an appearance on that program by Tatone and Denise Richie.  Tatone negotiated and entered into a legal agreement with the Show regarding the terms of the appearance.  Shortly before the program was scheduled to be taped, the Show requested photographs of Denise Richie and her parents.  Tatone contacted Denise Richie to obtain approval to use photographs for the Show and to discuss with Denise what photographs should be used.  Denise Richie had provided Tatone with a family photo album in connection with the trial.  Denise suggested that Tatone look through the album and find a picture of her in a graduation gown with her parents.  Tatone found a single picture in which Denise Richie was standing in a gown between an adult male and female.  Tatone provided this and one other photograph to the Show's producers.
<p>

The program was broadcast on November 5, 1992.  The Show's producers displayed the photo of Denise Richie in her graduation gown standing between two adults.  The two adults standing next to Denise Richie, however, were not Denise's parents, but her godparents,<A HREF="#2"><B><SMALL>2</SMALL></B></A>  Karen Gerten and James Richie.  The photo was displayed at various times during the broadcast including times coinciding with Denise Richie's description of the sexual abuse perpetrated against her by her father.  Gerten and Richie, however, were never identified by name; the names of Denise's parents were used throughout the Show.  Also, with Gerten and Richie's permission, a retraction was aired by the Show a few weeks after the broadcast.  Neither Karen Gerten nor James Richie saw their pictures used during the original telecast.  Each learned later, however, of the Show from family or friends and eventually each watched a videotape of the interview.
<P>

After viewing the tape, Richie stated that he was shocked, humiliated, blown away, and felt just crushed and very sick about the broadcast.  Richie also testified that:
<blockquote>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I don't take this lightly.  I put up with sexual abuse when I was a child in my home.  My father sexually abused my sister * * *.  The whole thing was so distasteful for me, you know, and  I don't want to go back and live my childhood over again for anything.  When I left the house and I started doing my own life and being a different person, then, you know, that was a great thing to me.  And now how many years later, all of a sudden now Denny commits these crimes and through someone's careless mistake or some bunch of people's careless mistake, you know, all of a sudden now I'm thrust back into a situation, you know.  That has caused me a great deal of emotional pain since I was a child * * * it * * * affect[s] me a lot and I * * * think about it every day.</FONT>
<p>
Gerten also testified concerning how the broadcast affected her:
<p>

<font size=-1>[I was] embarrassed by having that shown, that I was the mother of someone who was sexually molested by her dad and that I thought it was okay.  When I thought about it, I would get sick to my stomach and  emotionally, it was very upsetting * * *.<br>
[W]hen people would look at you, you would wonder if they saw the show, you know, are they staring at me because they saw the show * * *.  It was always on my mind.  It was upsetting and embarrassing.  You're already ashamed that it's even been involved in your family and then you're portrayed as the one who condoned it.  I guess I have to say that emotionally I was really, I guess you would say, a basket case.
</font></blockquote>
Finally, both Gerten and Richie testified that they will never know whether people saw the broadcast or think ill of them because of it.  The trial court found that neither Karen Gerten nor James Richie have lost any income or incurred any other special damages as a result of the broadcast.
<p>

On July 17, 1994, the trial court granted summary judgment for appellants MoPo and Paramount.  The court found that Gerten and Richie did not show sufficient harm to reputation to sustain a defamation claim, and that harm to reputation could not be presumed.  Additionally, the court found that the emotional harm shown by them could not support a defamation claim.  Finally, MoPo and Paramount had argued that New York law should apply to their case essentially because the broadcast originated in New York.  The trial court, however declined to hold on the choice of law issue because it found that under either state's law, it would grant summary judgment.
<p>

On November 17, 1994, the trial court granted summary judgment to Kathy Tatone.  It found that Tatone's communication was privileged by either the qualified immunity protecting an attorney from liability to third parties for actions arising out of the attorney-client relationship, or by a qualified privilege for statements made on a proper occasion for a proper motive.  It further found that Tatone was not liable for defamation because allowing recovery for emotional distress damages in a defamation action without injury to reputation would, in effect, convert defamation into false light invasion of privacy, and Minnesota has rejected the latter cause of action.
<p>

In a split decision, the court of appeals reversed.  The majority found that no privilege applied to Tatone.  <EM>Richie</EM>, 532 N.W.2d at 243 (Minn. App. 1995).  The court also found that harm to reputation could be presumed for purposes of summary judgment.  <EM>Id</EM>. at 240.  Finally, the court held that Minnesota law was applicable to the case.  <EM>Id</EM>. at 242.
<p>

Tatone appeals the court's findings regarding privileges for defamation and presumed harm in a defamation action.  MoPo and Paramount appeal the court's findings regarding presumed harm and choice of law.
<p>

On appeal from summary judgment, the reviewing court asks whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the trial court erred in its application of the law.  <EM>Cooper v. French</EM>, 460 N.W.2d 2, 4 (Minn. 1990).  Further, the trial court's findings of facts, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous * * *.  Minn. R. Civ. P. 52.01.
<p>

In Minnesota, the elements of defamation require the plaintiff to prove that a statement was false, that it was communicated to someone besides the plaintiff, and that it tended to harm the plaintiff's reputation and to lower him in the estimation of the community.  <EM>Rouse v. Dunkley & Bennett, P.A.</EM>, 520 N.W.2d 406, 410 (Minn. 1994).  It is the final element of this cause of action that is in dispute in this case.
<p>

Harm to reputation can, of course, be proven by direct evidence.  Moreover, in cases of defamation per se,  the common law<A HREF="#3"><B><SMALL>3</SMALL></B></A> allowed harm to reputation to be presumed.  <EM>See Becker v. Alloy Hardfacing & Engineering Co</EM>., 401 N.W.2d 655, 661 (Minn. 1987).  However, in <EM>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.</EM>, 418 U.S. 323 (1974), the U.S. Supreme Court held that in a private plaintiff  defamation action ag<A HREF="#4"><B><SMALL>4</SMALL></B></A>ainst a media defendant speaking on a matter of public concern, states may not constitutionally permit recovery of presumed * * * damages, at least when liability is not based on a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.  <EM>Id</EM>. at 349; <EM>see also Jacobson v. Rochester Communications</EM>, 410 N.W.2d 830, 836 n.7 (Minn. 1987); <EM>Jadwin v. Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co.</EM>, 367 N.W.2d 476, 492 (Minn. 1985).  The Court reached this conclusion through balancing the need for a vigorous and uninhibited press reflected in the First Amendment with a strong and legitimate state interest in compensating private individuals for wrongful injury to reputation * * *.  <EM>Gertz</EM> at 342 and 348.  The Court went on to state that [i]t is necessary to restrict defamation plaintiffs who do not prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth to compensation for actual injury.  <EM>Gertz</EM> at 349.
<p>

In the current case, the defamation occurred during a discussion of sexual abuse of children by their parents and legal recourse available to the abused child.  Such matters are certainly of public concern and were publicized by Paramount, MoPo and Tatone<A HREF="#5"><B><SMALL>5</SMALL></B></A>  via the television media.  Additionally, there are no allegations of actual malice.  Nonetheless, the court of appeals found that recovery could be based on presumed damages.  <em>Richie</em> at 239-40.  We find this holding to be in contravention of the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Gertz</em>.  In a case such as this, where the defamatory statements were made by the media, involved a matter of public concern, and there have been no allegations of actual malice, recovery cannot be based on presumed damages.  Therefore, to successfully litigate their defamation claim, plaintiffs must demonstrate actual damages.
<p>

This requirement does not change because plaintiffs might be attempting only to survive a summary judgment motion.  The court of appeals stated that [a]t least some' actual injury to [respondents] reputations can be assumed from the seriousness of [the] false statement seen on national TV, <EM>at least enough to survive a motion for summary judgment</EM>.  <EM>Richie</EM> at 240 (emphasis added).
<p>

We disagree.  In <EM>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc.</EM>, 477 U.S. 242, 254 (1986), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the judge must view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden.  As discussed above, the substantive evidentiary burden in this case requires that Gerten and Richie show actual harm.  Thus, we hold that, absent allegations of actual malice, in order to survive a summary judgment motion in a defamation action concerning statements made by the media and involving a matter of public concern, there must be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Gerten and Richie suffered actual harm; damages cannot be presumed.
<p>

Neither Gerten nor Richie argue to this court that they should survive summary judgment based on presumed harm to reputation.  Rather, they claim that they have suffered demonstrable harm to their reputations.  Gerten and Richie cite several inquiries [Richie received] from family and friends regarding his involvement with the abuse and criminal trial described in Maury Povich's interview.  Richie also testified that an employee at a Hardee's restaurant in Eden Prairie who was usually pretty nice, gave him the cold shoulder and. approximately a year after the broadcast, the restaurant served him three cheeseburgers that were all raw.  Finally, both respondents argue that they have come to understand they will never know whether people saw the broadcast or think ill of them because of it.
<p>

The trial court, however, found that neither Gerten nor Richie suffered actual damages to his or her respective reputation.  Regarding Richie, the trial court stated:
<blockquote>
<font size=-1>Richie has lost no income as a result of the broadcast, and he has incurred no expenses to mitigate, correct or counteract the broadcast, aside from this suit.  No one has indicated to him that they think less of him because of the broadcast.  No one has indicated to Richie that they thought he was one of Denise Richie's parents or was involved actively or passively in Denise Richie's abuse.  There has been no change in the behavior of those he regularly encounters as a Xerox service representative.</font></blockquote>

With respect to Gerten, the court found:
<blockquote>
<font size=-1>In the more than one year between the broadcast and Gerten's deposition, only [two people, who knew the photos were a mistake] contacted her about the show; no one else has contacted her or told her they watched the show.
<p>

In addition, the show had no effect on her work.  She has lost no income, incurred no expense and taken no steps to mitigate, correct or counteract the broadcast, aside from this suit.  No one has told Gerten they thought less of her because of the broadcast, and she can point to no specific facts demonstrating that her reputation has been affected.  Finally, she has heard no rumors in her home community * * * as a result of the broadcast.</font>
</blockquote>

These findings were based on deposition testimony of Gerten and Richie and are not clearly erroneous.  We conclude that neither Gerten nor Richie demonstrated that there is a material question of fact as to whether either of them suffered sufficient harm to their respective reputations to support a defamation claim.
<p>

Both Gerten and Richie, however, argue that even if they have not shown sufficient actual harm to their reputations, they should be allowed to recover for damages based on mental anguish and humiliation.  It is generally the case that once a defamation claim is established, damages for wounded feelings and humiliation are recoverable as parasitic damages.  <EM>Prosser</EM> states:
<blockquote>
<font size=-1>[O]nce the cause of action is established, either by the character of the defamation itself or by the proof of pecuniary loss, the bars are lowered, and general damages may be recovered for the injury to the plaintiff's reputation, his wounded feelings and humiliation, and resulting physical illness and pain, as well as estimated future damages of the same kind.  In other words, such damages are insufficient in themselves to make the slander actionable, but once the cause of action is made out without them, they may be tacked on as parasitic to it.
</font></blockquote>
<EM>W. Page Keeton et al.</EM>, <EM>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts</EM> § 112, at 794-95 (5th ed. 1984).
<p>


While <EM>Gertz</EM> did require a plaintiff to demonstrate actual harm, it did not mandate that the actual harm be to reputation.  That is, while actual damages are required in a defamation action of the type before us, there is no constitutional prerequisite that damages be based on <EM>reputational</EM> harm.  In <EM>Gertz</EM>, the Court stated:  [s]uffice it to say that actual injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.  Indeed, the more customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 350.
<p>

Indeed, two years after <EM>Gertz</EM>, in <EM>Time, Inc. v. Firestone</EM>, 424 U.S. 448, 460 (1976), the Supreme Court allowed recovery in a defamation action to be based on elements other than injury to reputation.  In <EM>Firestone</EM> the Court stated:
<blockquote>

<font size=-1>In [<EM>Gertz</EM>]we made it clear that States could base awards on elements other than injury to reputation, specifically listing personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering as examples of injuries which might be compensated consistently with the Constitution upon a showing of fault.  Because respondent has decided to forgo recovery for injury to her reputation, she is not prevented from obtaining compensation for such other damages that a defamatory falsehood may have caused her.</font>
</blockquote>

<EM>Firestone</EM> at 460.  Thus, there is no constitutional bar to recovery for a defamation claim based solely on emotional damages.
<p>

The question, then, becomes whether Minnesota allows defamation claims based exclusively on mental anguish and humiliation.  This court has never squarely addressed this issue.  However, Gerten and Richie argue that Minnesota law imposes no prerequisite of reputational harm on recovery of actual damages.  They cite <EM>Jadwin</EM>, 367 N.W.2d at 491-92 (Minn. 1985) and <EM>Becker</EM>, 401 N.W.2d at 655 (Minn. 1987) in support of their argument.
<p>

<EM>Jadwin</EM>, however, primarily involved the issue whether the plaintiff was a public figure for purposes of a libel action and the commensurate standard of fault.  This court merely acknowledged that [a]s required by <EM>Gertz</EM>, a private plaintiff may only recover compensation for actual injury * * *.  <EM>Jadwin</EM> at 491-92.  Gerten and Richie then point out that, under Gertz, actual injury may include personal humiliation and mental anguish and suffering.  While this may be, nothing in <EM>Gertz</EM> <EM>required</EM> that emotional harm be found sufficient to support recovery in a defamation claim.  Thus, <EM>Jadwin</EM> neither supports nor defeats Gerten and Richie's argument. 
<p>

<EM>Becker</EM> is also inapplicable to the present case.  <EM>Becker</EM> allowed general damages based on a defamation per se claim.  <EM>Id</EM>. at 661.  However, the case involved a private plaintiff suing a private defendant on a matter that was not of public concern.  <EM>Id</EM>.  Thus, the First Amendment limitations to defamation claims laid down in <EM>Gertz</EM> were inapplicable to <EM>Becker</EM>.  However, as explained above, that is not the situation here.  Thus, <EM>Becker</EM> is not controlling in the present circumstances.
<p>

Gerten and Richie also quote language from <EM>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Village of Isle</EM>, 265 Minn. 360, 122 N.W.2d 36 (1963), <EM>Larson v. Chase</EM>, 47 Minn. 307, 50 N.W. 238 (Minn. 1891), and <EM>Langeland v. Farmers State Bank of Trimont</EM>, 319 N.W.2d 26 (Minn. 1982) to support their argument.  However, both <EM>Village of Isle</EM> and <EM>Langeland</EM> only state that except in cases such as defamation, physical injury is required before recovery for mental anguish could be sustained.  Additionally, in <EM>Larson</EM>, Justice Mitchell simply pointed out that some right of the plaintiff must be violated before recovery for emotional damage would be allowed.  None of the cases in any way stated that emotional harm alone, unaccompanied by harm to reputation, could sustain a defamation claim.
<p>


Tatone, Paramount and MoPo, on the other hand, argue that a showing of actual harm to reputation should be required before a defamation action can be sustained.  We agree.  This court has consistently acknowledged that the purpose of a defamation action is to compensat[e] private individuals for wrongful injury to reputation.  <EM>See, e.g., Jadwin</EM>, 367 N.W.2d at 480 (Minn. 1985).
<p>

Further, this court has exercised historical caution regarding emotional distress claims.  <EM>K.A.C. v. Benson</EM>, 527 N.W.2d 553, 559 (Minn. 1995).  S<EM>ee, e.g., Garvis v. Employers Mutual Casualty Co.</EM>, 497 N.W.2d 254, 257 n.3 (Minn. 1993) (Emotional distress is highly subjective, often transient, and easily alleged.).  While neither <EM>K.A.C.</EM> nor <EM>Garvis</EM> involved a defamation claim, we see nothing inherent in such a claim that should inhibit our caution.
<p>

Finally, while defamation focuses on injury to reputation, it is invasion of privacy torts  that compensate for mental distr<A HREF="#6"><SMALL><STRONG>6</STRONG></SMALL></A>ess from having been exposed to public view.  <EM>Time Inc. v. Hill</EM>, 385 U.S. 374, 385 n.9 (1967).  Thus, to allow emotional harm to form the basis for liability in a defamation action would be the practical equivalent of allowing a plaintiff to bring an invasion of privacy claim.  However, this court has never recognized, either by legislative or court action, a cause of action for invasion of privacy, even though many other states have done so.  <EM>Hendry v. Conner</EM>, 226 N.W.2d 921, 923 (Minn. 1975)  To allow emotional harm as the basis of a defamation action would be inconsistent with this court's rejection of invasion of privacy claims.  Thus we hold that in a defamation suit, emotional damages are not compensable absent harm to reputation.<A HREF="#7"><B><SMALL>7</SMALL></B></A> 
<p>

Having decided that Minnesota law imposes a reputational harm prerequisite in defamation actions, we must now address whether Minnesota law applies in this action.  Because the Show was taped and broadcast from New York, Paramount and MoPo contend that New York law should apply.  However, because we find that the outcome of this action would be the same regardless of whether we applied Minnesota or New York law, we can dispose of this issue without engaging in a full blown choice of law analysis.
<p>

In determining whether the forum state's or a foreign state's law applies, a threshold consideration is whether the choice of one state's law over another's creates an actual conflict.  <EM>Jepson v. General Cas. Co. of Wisc.</EM>, 513 N.W.2d 467, 469 (Minn. 1994).  In this case, such a conflict would arise if New York law did not impose a reputational harm prerequisite in defamation actions.<A HREF="#8"><B><SMALL>8</SMALL></B></A> 
<p>

The court of appeals found New York law to be unsettled on the issue of a reputational harm prerequisite.  <EM>Richie</EM>, 532 N.W.2d at 240, n.3.  While we agree that New York law is muddled in this area, we find that even if we were to decide that New York law applied, we would still impose a reputational harm prerequisite.  Applying <EM>Gertz</EM>, <EM>France v. St. Clare's Hospital and Health Ctr.</EM>, 82 A.D.2d 1, 441 N.Y.S.2d 79 (N.Y. App. Div. 1981), and S<EM>alomone v. McMillan Publications. Inc.</EM>, 77 A.D.2d 501, 429 N.Y.S. 441 (N.Y. App. Div. 1980), specifically held that in a defamation action, claims for emotional distress are not compensable absent damage to reputation.  <EM>France</EM>, 441 N.Y.S.2d at 82; <EM>Salomone</EM>, 429 N.Y.S.2d at 443.  However, two later cases, <EM>Matherson v. Marchello</EM>, 100 A.D.2d 233, 473 N.Y.S.2d 998 (N.Y. App. Div. 1984) and <EM>Hogan v. Herald Co.</EM>, 84 A.D.2d 470, 446 N.Y.S.2d 836 (N.Y. App. Div. 1982), <EM>aff'd</EM> 444 N.E.2d 1002 (N.Y. 1982), found that allegations of both reputational and emotional harm sufficiently claim actual injuries to survive a summary judgment motion.  <EM>Id.</EM>, 446 N.Y.S.2d at 843.
<p>

Nonetheless, we find that neither <EM>Hogan</EM> nor <EM>Matherson</EM> are as unequivocal about the absence of a reputational harm prerequisite as <EM>France</EM> and <EM>Salomone</EM> are about its existence.  In <EM>Hogan</EM>, the plaintiff was not claiming only emotional harm, but was also claiming harm to reputation.  Thus, <EM>Hogan</EM> did not directly address the question of a reputational harm prerequisite as both <EM>France</EM> and <EM>Salomone</EM> did.  Further, while <EM>Matherson</EM> does limit the holdings of both <EM>France</EM> and <EM>Salomone</EM>, we do not read <EM>Matherson</EM> as completely abrogating those two cases' imposition of a reputational harm prerequisite.<A HREF="#9"><B><SMALL>9</SMALL></B></A> 
<p>

Respondents also cite to <EM>Pirre v. Printing Developments Inc.</EM>, 468 F.Supp. 1028 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) and <EM>Guccione v. Hustler Magazine Inc.</EM>, 632 F. Supp. 313 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) in support of the absence of a reputational harm prerequisite in New York.  However, following both cases, the Second Circuit decided <EM>Dalbec v. Gentleman's Companion, Inc.</EM>, 828 F.2d 921 (2nd Cir. 1987), in which the court stated that New York does not permit compensatory damages to be recovered absent proof of injury to reputation or malice.  Id. at 926-27.  We read this as overruling any contrary holdings in either <EM>Pirre</EM> or <EM>Guccione</EM>.
<p>

Finally, courts in other jurisdictions have found that New York does have a reputational harm prerequisite in defamation cases.  <EM>See, e.g., Little Rock, Newspapers, Inc. v. Dodrill</EM>, 660 S.W.2d 933, 936-37 (Ark. 1983); <EM>Gobin v. Globe Publishing Co.</EM>, 649 P.2d 1239, 1243 (Kan. 1982).
<p>

For these reasons, we find that whether we apply New York or Minnesota law in this case, we would impose a reputational harm prerequisite.  Thus, for purposes of this appeal, no actual conflict exists between the law of the two states and we therefore need not reach the issue of which law should be applied.
<p>

We are now in a position to decide the matter at hand.  We have determined that it would violate the First Amendment to allow Gerten and Richie to recover based on presumed damage to their reputations.  We have also held that respondents' defamation claim cannot succeed based only on humiliation or other types of emotional harm.  Thus, respondents must be able to show actual harm to their reputations.  Because the trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that neither Gerten nor Richie suffered actual harm to their reputations, we hold that neither Gerten's nor Richie's defamation action can succeed.  We therefore reinstate the trial court's orders granting summary judgment to appellants Tatone, Paramount and MoPo.
<p>
Reversed; trial court judgment reinstated.

<A NAME="1"></A>1  Hubbard Broadcasting, which broadcast the Show within Minnesota, was also originally named as a defendant.  However, claims against Hubbard were dismissed with prejudice by stipulation dated August 25, 1993.
<p>
 
<A NAME="2"></A>2  Respondents have also been referred to as Denise Richie's maternal aunt and paternal uncle.
<p>

<A NAME="3"></A>3  W. Page Keeton et al., <EM>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts</EM> § 112, at 795 5th ed. 1984) defines defamation per se to be
<blockquote><font size=-1>
actionable without the necessity of pleading and proving that the plaintiff had suffered any impairment of his reputation or other harm as a result. In other words, the existence of damage [is] conclusively presumed or assumed from the publication of the libel itself, without any evidence to show actual harm of any kind.
</font></blockquote>
Among those types of actions which are defamatory per se are false accusations of committing a crime * * * .  <EM>Becker</EM>, 401 N.W.2d at 661.  Also, [a] statement is defamatory per se if it imputes serious sexual misconduct to the subject of the statement.  <EM>Baufield v. Safelite Glass Corp.</EM>,  831 F.Supp. 713, 717 (D. Minn. 1993); <EM>see also</EM> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 559-570 (1977).
<p>

<A NAME="4"></A>4  That is, a plaintiff that is neither a public figure nor a public official.
<p>

<A NAME="5"></A>5  Because Tatone's communication utilized the television media, we place her in the same legal position with respect to Gerten and Richie's claims as we place Paramount and MoPo.  <EM>See</EM>, W. Page Keeton et al., <EM>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts</EM>, § l12 at 796 (stating that presumed damages cannot be recovered in defamation actions at least against the press or broadcast media <EM>and those who utilize these means</EM> unless actual malice is shown) (emphasis added).
<p>

<A NAME="6"></A>6  <EM>Prosser</EM> notes that there are four separate kinds of invasion of privacy:  (1) appropriation for the defendant's benefit or advantage of the plaintiff's name or likeness; (2) intrusion upon the plaintiff's physical solitude or seclusion; (3) publicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye; and (4) public disclosure of private facts.  <EM>Id.</EM> § 117 at 851-66.
<p>

<A NAME="7"></A>7  We note that we are not the only jurisdiction to so hold.  Other jurisdictions have also imposed a reputational harm prerequisite in defamation actions.  <EM>See, e.g., Garziano v. E.I. DuPont deNemours & Co.</EM>, 818 F.2d 380, 395 (5th Cir. 1987) (applying Mississippi law); <EM>Little Rock, Newspapers, Inc. v. Dodrill</EM>, 660 S.W.2d 933, 936-37 (Ark. 1983); <EM>Gobin v. Globe Publishing Co.</EM>, 649 P.2d 1239, 1243 (Kan. 1982).
<p>

<A NAME="8"></A>8  As the court of appeals points out, if this case were to be remanded for trial, the question of the standard of proof in a defamation action by a private plaintiff would create an actual conflict.  Minnesota applies a negligence standard, <EM>Jadwin at 492</EM>, and New York, a gross irresponsibility standard.  <EM>Chapadeau v. Utica Observer-Dispatch, Inc.</EM>, 341 N.E.2d 569, 571 (N.Y. 1975).  However, because this appeal disposes of all the issues in this case without remand, no actual conflict is created the this difference in law.
<p>

<A NAME="9"></A>9  In <EM>Matherson</EM>, the court stated that we find that the cases which require a plaintiff to plead special damages, establish * * * actual malice, or suffer dismissal of the complaint (e.g. [citing <EM>France</EM> and <EM>Salomone</EM>]), cut far too broadly and their analysis has been rejected by the Court of Appeals.  <EM>Matherson</EM>, 473 N.Y.S.2d at 1003.  In <EM>Matherson</EM>, special damages were defined to be the loss of something having economic or pecuniary value' * * * which must flow directly from the injury to reputation caused by the defamation, not from the effects of defamation.'  <EM>Id.</EM>, 473 N.Y.S.2d at 1000 (citations omitted).  Thus, <EM>Matherson</EM> could be read to have specifically rejected the reputational harm prerequisite of <EM>Salomone</EM> and <EM>France</EM>.
<p>
However, <EM>Matherson</EM> rejected only the requirement that a plaintiff plead special damages to support a defamation action.  Thus, given the definition of special damages, <EM>Matherson</EM> could be read as rejecting only the necessity of finding pecuniary damage flowing from harm to reputation, not a general showing of some harm to reputation such as lowering of esteem in the eyes of the community.  Therefore, <EM>Matherson</EM> could be read as not rejecting the reputational harm prerequisite erected in <EM>France</EM> and <EM>Salomone</EM>.

<FONT SIZE=+2>A</font>s use of the Internet proliferates, conflicts are arising over appropriate regulation of the content of cyberspace communications.  Congress enacted the Communications Decency Act, but a court declared it unconstitutional.  An electronic bulletin board operator in California was convicted in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, on criminal charges.  Law enforcement authorities in Germany threatened prosecution of CompuServe, an Ohio-based company, for the content of material available through CompuServes network.  In light of such developments, this seminar will provide an overview of issues related to Internet content regulation, including such issues as the First Amendment, jurisdiction, choice of law, defamation and privacy.

<FONT SIZE=+2>S</font>ignificant new developments occurred in many areas of patent law in 1996.  These developments involved not only substantive changes in the law, but also several issues of first impression appearing in Federal Circuit decisions throughout the year. Several Federal Circuit decisions also interpreted the insubstantial differences test for determining infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, which was a test announced by the Federal Circuit in the important Hilton-Davis decision.  Meanwhile, the Hilton-Davis case itself is on appeal to the United States Supreme Court, which could render its decision at anytime now.  The patent bar eagerly awaits the Supreme Court decision to see how it will affect the test for determining infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.  A number of unusual district court decisions also appeared, which could be the harbinger of even more change in the patent laws in the event that such lower court decisions were to be upheld by the Federal Circuit on appeal. This session will provide an overview of these recent developments, so that patent attorneys and business persons alike can more fully appreciate how these developments might affect how patents can and cannot be used to support strategic business planning and meet specific business objectives.

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</font>his session will explore recent developments in the law of copyrights, including recent legislation and international agreements.  The presentation will include discussion of the issue as raised in a recent Fifth Circuit case <EM>Chavez v. Arte Publico Press</EM>, 59 F.3d 539 (5th Cir. 1995).  The case is still pending reconsideration after remand from the U.S. Supreme Court subsequent to its decision in <EM>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</EM>, 517 U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. ____, 134 L.Ed. 252 (1996), which limited Congress ability to abrogate states Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  The presentation will provide background regarding why Congress cannot generally abrogate a states sovereign immunity and the limited circumstances under which it can.  It will also include a discussion of how a state might waive its immunity.  Finally, the presentation will discuss practical steps a client dealing with the state can take to protect himself or herself should the courts decide that a state may exercise their eleventh amendment sovereign immunity against copyright infringement suits brought in federal court.

<FONT SIZE=+2>I</font>ntellectual property laws of great importance to the medical technology industry are in a state of transition.  Congress recently enacted legislation which limits the remedies available against infringers of patented medical and surgical procedures.  District and Federal Circuit court decisions reflect a trend away from broad claim constructions and hostility toward the Doctrine of Equivalents as we await the Supreme Courts <EM>Hilton Davis</EM> decision.  Contracts for the acquisition and licensing of intellectual property rights continue to be critical to the successful commercialization of medical technology, and are therefore frequent topics of dispute.  In the future, the diagnosis and treatment of intellectual property issues in the medical technology field will clearly be enhanced by greater up-front focus on the patent application process and forward-thinking contract drafting.  This seminar session will describe these developments and address their impact on medical technology companies.

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</font>ransactions with the Federal Government can take various forms, including supply contracts, service contracts, software development contracts, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), and others.  In addition, companies engaged in the licensing or sale of intellectual property to foreign parties often fail to recognize that such transactions are subject to U.S. export control laws which can expose such companies to severe potential consequences if the laws are violated.  This presentation will discuss methods for protecting your intellectual property in government transactions and maximizing your rights in intellectual property resulting from such transactions.  The discussion will include recent developments under the Freedom of Information Act, Department of Defense software and technical data regulations, the impact of new commercial item acquisition procedures, and remedies for the governments violation of intellectual property rights.  An introduction to the scope and framework of U.S. export laws will be presented together with an update on recent developments in export controls on encryption software.

<H2>The Global School Project</H2>  
<P>School children around the globe share the same inquisitive desire to find
out more about the world outside their classroom. In the past this curiosity has
had to be satisfied by looking through atlases or encyclopedias. Now, the
Internet provides a new forum whereby children can learn from each other and
exchange ideas with their counterparts anywhere in the world. </P>
<P>The potential of this Global School is enormous; bringing children closer
together and creating a spirit of understanding and cooperation. The Global
School will also enable educational and training materials to be distributed to
any school linked to the Internet at almost no cost. Resources developed for
children in any country can be shared with schools throughout the world.
Interaid is involved in working with educational software developers in order to
build up a library of training materials fo distribution around the world.</P>
<P> To become part of the Global School, all that a school requires is a
computer, modem and suitable telecommunication link. Interaid is working towards
this goal by providing the relevant equipment and training to schools which are
not presently fortunate enough to have these facilities. Initially, this will
involve schools in the UK and South Africa but the long term objective is to
link up other secondary schools all over the world.

<H1>April 1996 Newsletter</H1>
<P>Welcome to the first edition of  'Short Cuts,' a new electronic publication
aimed at keeping you in touch with our efforts to link British schools with
their counterparts in poorer countries. 
</P>
<P>Interaid is the brain-child of Nick Short, a lecturer at Reading University,
whose long-standing interest in computer technology and its social and economic
impact, led him to recognise the potential of using the Internet to link young
people around the world.  After much research, Interaid was launched succesfully
on March 11th, 1996, with the intention of giving children the opportunity to
share information and learn more about different cultures and lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
As an educational device, Interaid's concept of  the global school is
compelling. In countries where access  to new research, scientific data and
academic expertise is often hampered by financial problems, the global school,
with its walled-garden facility is of great value.   This has been  illustrated
sharply by the speed and enthusiasm with which schools in South Africa, Jamaica
and India have expressed their interest in our plans.  However, the merits of
Interaid's international, electronic network go far beyond than the transfer of
educational material from North to South. 
</P>
<P>For too long, the people of develping nations have been told what is good
for them and had &quot;improvement&quot; schemes imposed upon them, often with
the minimum of consultation.   Their countries are home to legions of &quot;advisers&quot;
and &quot;consultants&quot; who though well-meaning, are sometimes viewed as
prolonging a culture of dependency that has poorer countries looking to the
continents of Europe and North America for support.  We at Interaid do not
intend to follow this well-worn development path. We seek to create a true
relationship between school-children the world over, so that a meaningful
dialogue can take place.  Where once children from Southampton to Soweto, sought
understanding in books, encyclopaedias and atlases, our global school intiative
will enable them to explore cultural diversity, to asks questions about national
lifestyles and receive answers by lively, interactive means.
</P>
<P>
Interaid's global school will develop into a rich, well-spring of academic and
cultural information from which young people around the world will be able to
draw 24 hours a day.  Of course, we recognise the size of this bold undertaking.
</P>
<P>Over the last two decades, the sheer pace and scale of computer development
has added significantly to the South's technology deficit. This alone makes a
nonsense of the argument that certain regions of the world can afford to stand
aside blithely from such advances.  The people of poorer nations certainly give
no indication of wishing so to do. They want the modern technological skills
that can improve their nations, as any visitor to such countries can testify. 
It is our wish to assist this demand in a manner which is both sustainable and
responsible.  
</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H2>WHY INTERAID?  - By Nick Short 
</H2>
<P>In the past 10 years, information technology has had an enormous impact on
society in the developed countries of the world. Today everything from
commercial enterprises to academic institutes have become dependent on the
efficiency of computers.   Whilst there have been some negative repercussions,
there can be little doubt that the &quot;computer revolution&quot; has affected
people's lives to an extent comparable to that of  the 18th century's Industrial
revolution. 
</P>
<P>The developing countries of the world have lagged far behind the wealthy
nations in their adoption of this new technology. This is due to a limited
access to computers, the lack of training in their use and the problems of
adapting Western technology to Third World needs among other factors.   The
consequence has been that many such countries are at risk of being left behind
in this new revolution placing them at an even greater disadvantage in their
struggle to keep pace with Western development and maintain their global
influence. 
</P>
<P>INTERAID intends to address the unbalanced share of information technology
by channeling resources from computer users in the North to assist the people of
the South to develop similar skills.  
</P>
<P>Training software developed at the University of Reading will be sold in
Europe and the United States to fund Interaid projects in developing countries. 
 This &quot;Robin Hood&quot; approach provides the a win-win approach which will
benefit both existing computer users in the North world whilst encouraging new
users in the South. 
</P>
<P>To focus the limited resources of INTERAID we have decided initially to
concentrate on providing secondary schools in British Commonwealth countries
with the latest computer technology. All participating schools will be linked up
via the Internet to a secure walled garden where school children and their
teachers can communicate with each other around the world.   This will provide
the children of today with the technology that they will need for the coming
century. We also hope that by improving communication between countries we will
help to foster a climate of international understanding and cooperation. </P>

<H1>May 1996 Newsletter</H1>
<P>Welcome to Short Cuts, your monthly electronic publication keeping you
informed about Interaid&#146;s  plans to use the Internet to link schools in
Africa, Asia and the Caribbean with their British counterparts.  
</P>
<P>Interaid has been particularly active this month. Our attempt to create a
global school has caught the imagination of the British media and Interaid&#146;s
founder Nick Short, has featured in local and national press and on radio.  
</P>
<P>Our range of  Microsoft training software HOVI Help has increased and we
have been able to take on new workers to speed up our product development.  We
have submitted our software for review by some of Britain&#146;s leading
computer magazines. So far, the response has been generally favourable.

<P>Oxford University&#146;s 676-year-old Bodleian Library, holds 5.6 million
books with a word count of more than 700 billion. Computer experts have
predicted that they will be able to catalogue the entire collection onto just
six Compact Discs over the next ten years.  
</P>
<H3>ORACLE MARCH ON  
</H3>
<P>Predicting the end of the PC comes Oracle, chief trumpeter of the Net
Computer (NC). Oracle claims the NC will supplant the PC in the home and office
because it offers less expensive access to the Internet and Intranet, a basic
Internet system with enhanced security, which enables the publication of
internal web sites. 
</P>
<P>Microsoft, Compaq, Sun, Philips and Apple are all rumoured to be producing
their own home Internet systems which could be available this summer.

<H3>BLAIR&#146;S  INTERNET PLEDGE TO SCHOOLS 
</H3>
<P>British Labour Party leader Tony Blair, reaffirmed in a keynote speech this
month that if elected his government will ensure that &#147;every school and
college will be connected up to the developing information superhighway.&#148; 
</P>
<P>Mr Blair has set up a panel under the chairmanship of Dennis Stevenson which
will investigate the challenges involved in linking educational institutions to
the Internet.  The panel comprises teachers, business people, financiers and
educationalists and has been asked to identify the main technological choices
available, their consequences for the national curriculum and teacher training
and how Labour&#146;s plans can be funded by a private-public partnership.   The
panel is expected to report by summer&#146;s end.

<H3>THE SUPERHIGHWAY&#146;S GOLDEN GOOSE  
</H3>
<P>Students of the future will learn by computer, will be taught by computer in
virtual universities open 24 hours a day and will take their examinations by
computer.  The crowded, stuffy lecture theatre will be a thing of the past. The
nervous tension of the examination room may well go the same way. Pen, paper and
crib sheets will be the cherished relics of a distant era.   Virtual students
will be able to select their own teaching schedule, work at their own pace and
have access to a tutor, library and a virtual student union association where
surfers can net-graze to their heart&#146;s content. Welcome to the new world
order of the Cybergrad. 
</P>
<P>Within 10 years, the number of Internet-users world-wide will exceed 100
million. This and the sheer capacity of the Internet to transform the provision
of education and the methods by which students learn, are the current obsessions
of university chancellors, now sniffing out every opportunity to bring in more
revenue for their embattled institutions. 
</P>
<P>Distance learning is the new buzz word among academics and the race is now
on to make real the concept of using the Internet to educate students from Accra
to Acapulco in the comfort of their own homes. 
</P>
<P>Professor Diana Laurillard, the pro-Vice Chancellor of Britain&#146;s Open
University claims that her institution has already committed &#163;10 million to
investigating the potential of distance learning and  numbers 15,000 students
with access to its on-line network.   Talks are already underway between the
university&#146;s academics and business leaders with a view to pioneering a new
programme of courses for foreign students.  Professor Laurillard told the
British Daily Express newspaper that the Open University wanted to: &#147;Integrate
the complexity of technology with course structure to expand the options open to
students.   &#147;The technology aspect opens up whole new horizons for research
with access to vast resources of information around the world.&#148;  According
to the university, students of some 59 courses use the Internet, bulletin boards
and electronic discussion groups during their academic work and the university
has allocated &#163;1.25 million towards expanding the new technology used in
the delivery of its curriculum. 
</P>
<P>The Open University has also set up the 30-strong Knowledge Media Institute
(KMI) to investigate how  multi-media can enhance learning.  The attraction of
distance learning by computer is obvious. It may relieve some of the financial
costs, on both sides, of delivering an educational curriculum to foreign
students. Moreover, it may help to stem the brain drain from South to North and
make available research material which will enable academics to keep up to date
where ever they may be located. 
</P>
<P>Yet it is the very flexibility of learning by computer which has encouraged
institutions such as the Open University to look kindly on the system.  The Open
University&#146;s current distance learning techniques require students to watch
or video-record television transmissions which often air late in the evening or
early hours of the morning. Work is prepared by students in isolation and sent
to lecturers for appraisal.   Many Open University students complain of the
isolation they feel which is only punctuated by the occasional study weekends
and retreats. 
</P>
<P>The virtual universities of the future will offer students visual
interaction with lecturers and provide on-line study groups.  Indeed, the
prestigious North American Yale and Harvard universities now offer students the
world over the chance to attend via an international video-conferencing link
beamed by satellite.    
</P>
<H2>COMMENT                     
</H2>
<P>Each month, we invite readers of these pages to give their personal view on
matters affecting development, education or information technology. 
</P>
<P>This month, Malcolm King, a natural resources consultant, gives his personal
account of  development &#145;African style.&#146;   
</P>
<H3>PLAYING THE DEVELOPMENT GAME   
</H3>
<P>For something so apparently simple, development is a maddening term to get
people to agree upon. Everyone thinks they know what it means but then for each
person consulted it has different nuances.  &#147;Oh yes,&#148; said one friend.
&#147;Development is definitely progress towards greater freedom, more skills
and material well-being.&#148;  Comprehensive, I thought, until I asked another
who said that development can also mean the provision of a safe and reliable
water supply, road building and agricultural development. 
</P>
<P>For others, it is equally the availability of teachers, volunteers and
assorted experts to bring their collective expertise to bear on particular
issues which defy local competence.  Then again, there are those who give
development the widest scope possible. For example, one British aid agency in
Kenya negotiated with government authorities to bring to the country a cricket
coach who would improve local standards. Basketball &#145;experts&#146; have
already done tours of duty on behalf of America&#146;s Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>Of course, all of these definitions are worthy of consideration but perhaps
it is this very flexibility that has given development something of a bad name. 
Drawing together all of the above explanations leads to the general conclusion
that development at its most positive should aim to improve and uplift what
exists currently.   Yet when this maxim is applied in any examination of
development in Africa, the result is sobering. In the 30 years since most
African countries gained their independence, the evidence available to justify
any association with the words development or progress is subject to doubt. </P>
<P>Africa has changed all right but how much of it has been for the better? 
The continent can throw up precious few exemplars to make good all the work done
and the words spoken by the serried ranks of government ministers,
non-governmental organisations and donor financiers.  Africa, the playground of
the rogue and the well-intentioned, can hardly be championed as a shining model
of the successful implementation of development theories proposed by the legions
of consultants who have offered their expensive expert analysis. 
</P>
<P>In all fairness, doubt should not be cast upon the genuine development work
which continues little remarked the length and breadth of Africa and has done so
for the past three decades.   Few can seriously argue that the improvements to
infrastructure and communications have not made a huge difference to communities
hitherto isolated.  Equally, it is unquestionably true that carefully appraised
and applied water projects or immunisation programmes have contributed
enormously to the betterment of people&#146;s lives. 
</P>
<P>Yet the overriding impression left by too many development projects is one
of missed opportunities.  Who is to blame? The usual suspects can be rounded up
and used as defence witnesses in the case  against development. Mischievous
governments, unscrupulous multi-nationals, widespread corruption, climatic
stress, over-reliance on commodities, impossible foreign debt schedules, ethnic
disputes and the ravages of neo-colonialism all take their places rightfully as
contributors to Africa&#146;s malaise.  But should United Nations programmes,
NGOs, donor organisations and aid agencies escape their share of the blame?  
Surely, after more than 30 years it is time to hold such organisations up to the
full glare of public scrutiny and ask of them a few hard questions. 
</P>
<P>Why is it that all the most important economic and social indices governing
individual quality of life and national well-being reflect so unfavourably on
Africa when there is so much development work taking place across the continent?
 In these circumstances, who and what is being developed?  If Africa has first
call on the world&#146;s experts, supplemented by a thriving home-grown
development &#145;industry&#146; which exists presumably to accelerate progress
and wealth generation, what are these development professionals doing as the
continent continues its economic decline? 
</P>
<P>The 1990 United Nations review of Africa&#146;s commodity problems, revealed
that the continent has 28 of the world&#146;s 42 poorest nations.  The same
report highlighted the decline in Africa&#146;s economic fortunes at a time of 
a rapid population explosion, perpetuating environmental deterioration and an
ever increasing dependence on food imports.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980&#146;s, only six of Africa&#146;s 50 states experienced growth
exceeding more than two per cent per annum. Since 1980, income per head in
Africa has declined every year, although some analysts point to recent
improvements in countries such as Uganda and Ghana.  Moreover, in 1988, Africa
earned $18 billion dollars from the sale of its commodities, excluding oil, on
the international markets. In real terms, this was 28 per cent lower than in
1980 and 35 per cent less than the sum received in 1970.  Published data of this
kind does nothing but confirm the perception that Africa has ceased to develop
economically in comparison with other parts of the world and advances the charge
of the pessimists that this situation will only worsen.  Something clearly is
awry. </P>
<P>So much effort, so many projects, so great the number of experts when the
aggregate result is so infuriatingly meagre.  Of course, it is not wise to
censure NGOs, donors and development agencies too severely when the trying
conditions they are often forced to work under are taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
It is also true to say that the odds against improvement, progress and
development on the African continent do seem daunting especially given the
current international economic position.  But let us not be too charitable.
Development has &#147;failed&#148; because it has become a game, a righteous
indulgence which has become somehow removed from the real lives of the
communities it was intended to serve. 
</P>
<P>The game goes something like this. Development agencies petition foreign
donors with elaborate and well meaning proposals requiring vital funding.  
Money is donated accordingly to the favoured projects which begin amid scenes of
widespread joy and energy. Evaluation is often haphazard. Failure all too
frequently ensues by which time the donor has forgotten about the project and
moved on to other interests, leaving the way clear for the agency to demand more
money for another absolutely vital concern.  Even failure itself does not always
demand a critical review. Generous allowances are made and excuses all too often
receive a fairer hearing than they might deserve.  A grotesque parody, you might
think but I would wager that it remains closer to the truth than some dare
admit. 
</P>
<P>
&#147;Progress&#148; has become something of a merry-go-round, development
agencies and their foreign sponsors twirling arm in arm while Africa awaits the
results.  Donor organisations, NGOs, environment and development agencies have
all too often been at fault in their choice of projects.  Kenya&#146;s
disastrous Turkwell Dam and the &#145;white-elephant&#146; fish processing plant
at Turkhana, are but mere cameos of development fiascos across Africa. 
</P>
<P>As the development sector blossoms, a development culture flourishes and
sloth and waste set in. With the most emotive of working briefs to dispel
criticism, NGOs in cohoots with their foreign donor counterparts, have become
adept at junketing.  The circuit of conferences, workshops and &#145;brainstorming
sessions,&#146; spans the globe. No country is too far flung to host one
activity or another. </P>
<P>Many a senior development worker has toured the world in the name of
progress.  It is not uncommon to find NGO and development agency representatives
staying in expensive hotels and eating nouvelle cuisine while they discuss the
effects of poverty, malnutrition and under-development in their home countries. 
On top of all of this, participants at such conferences can expect to receive
payment for their attendance. Those who were present at a six day &#145;development&#146;
workshop in Nakuru, Kenya in August 1994, pocketed $240 in hard currency &#147;expenses&#148;
just for turning up, even though the costs of their travel, board and lodging
were met by the conference&#146;s sponsor. 
</P>
<P>It is churlish to suggest that little of substance emerges from such
workshops or that more would be achieved if delegates gathered together in grim,
austere surroundings. Conferences are important opportunities to network and
share ideas with like-minded people. In developing countries, they are often
crucial in mobilising a national action plan.  Yet, by establishing the practice
of  paying delegates and installing them in plush hotels, organisers have become
hostage to the curse of the  &#147;going rate.&#148;  Failure to pay an
anticipated sum in hard currency could lead to a conference being abandoned by
the very people it was designed to attract. </P>
<P>A chicken and egg dilemma yes, but surely one the donors and their local
agents might have seen coming.  Foresight however, is all to uncommon given the
size of the bureaucracy spawned in the name of development. This cumbersome,
conservative and self-regarding behemoth devours enormous sums on salaries,
trips, projects, property and additional &#147;expenses.&#148; How much of this
vast fortune can truly be justified?  Moreover, far too much money is spent on
what appears to be passing whims. This years fad - population control. Last year&#146;s
- tree nurseries. And next year? The runners include sustainable energy projects
and women&#146;s groups! All very worthy but real progress requires strategic,
long-term planning and a clear vision rather than the multi-focus approach which
currently prevails.
</P>
<P>
The sheer number of players adds to this confusion. With the myriad NGO
proposals competing alongside government programmes and foreign-aided private
schemes, there is tremendous scope for deliberate misadventure.  In presenting
the case against development as it reveals itself now, it is not my intention to
challenge its legitimacy entirely, only to point out its failings.  Development
agencies can play a responsible role in improving the fortunes of Africa&#146;s
citizens. If they fail to do so, their very credibility may soon be open to
question.     
</P>
<P>So, is Malcolm King right? Is development a game played by the self-seeking
to Africa&#146;s detriment? Tell us what you think.

It is available free from Macromedia:<b><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/" target=mm_window><img align=left border=0 width=88 height=31 src="../media/radio/radio_pix/getshockwave.gif"><br clear=left><font size=2>Download the Shockwave plug-in</font></a></b><br clear=all><br>Macromedia provides its own <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/technotes/shockwave/" target=mm_window>shockwave technical support page</a> which will give you all the information you need about hardware requirements, installing and using the Shockwave plug-in. <h3>PLAYBACK</h3>Audio features are encoded in high quality RealAudio 3.0 in order to give them the best local playback potential.  You must have the RealAudio player installed on your computer.  It is available free from Progressive Networks:<b><a href="http://www.realaudio.com/products/player/index.html" target=mm_window><img border=0 width=70 height=45 align=left src="../media/radio/radio_pix/realaudio.gif"><br clear=left><font size=2>Download the RealAudio Player</font></a></b><br clear=all><br>For more information about RealAudio, consult the <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/help/FAQ/" target=mm_window>Frequently Asked Questions</a> index.  There is also extensive <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/help/library/"  target=mm_window>technical support</a> available on the site.<h3>RECORDING AND REBROADCASTING</h3>Once you are equipped with the correct software, all you need to do is to record the local audio playback from your computer to whatever system you are using.  Your computer will have an 'audio out' or a 'headphones' socket on the back - simply connect this to your recording machine.<h3>QUALITY</h3>Audio features available here have been recorded to a much higher quality than would be possible with live over-the-Net playback - there simply isn't the bandwidth available for high bit-rate audio streaming, so we are offering features for download and local playback instead.  The quality should be about AM-quality - slightly below conventional FM broadcast quality.<p><pre></pre><a href="index.html">Back to front page</a></body></html>

Remember that our readers are Canadian,Australian, Indian, Kenyan, American...  <BR><BR>Well I tried. I tried comparing the passions roused by sport to those ofnationalism. No good - too Brit. I went home and wrote about the strugglesI have had with my own Anglo-Dutch identity. They wouldn't like that either- too European. And the one about the Scottish woman I interviewedabout Scottish nationalism in Glasgow; well, it was just too - Scottish.<BR><BR>I just can't do it. As soon as I start writing personally about anythingto do with national identity it comes back to Europe, which is where I comefrom. <BR><BR>Which is probably also why the many fascinating books I have read on thesubject during the course of my research were all abstract, academic -and in the third person.<img width=83 height=114 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 src="editor.jpg"> They were also almost all by men, which confirmsmy theories about the links between nationalism and war and my prejudicesabout boys and war toys. <BR><BR>But I enjoyed commissioning this magazine: so many people felt stronglyabout their own national identity, and each story and each context sheda different light on the whole. I felt confirmed in my suspicions that thiswas one of the most important issues facing our world today. I was spell-boundby Ikaweba Bunting's vision of an Africa without boundaries. It was goodto have extensive if expensive telephone conversations about feminism andnationalism with Urvashi Butalia in India (see page 26) and equally fascinatingdiscussions with Maggie Murray of Format Photographers who helped me tocook up the idea for the front cover over a delicious Japanese lunch.<BR><BR>Having ideas on nationalism is one thing - and everyone seems to havethem, from our Pakistani neighbour to John Major, 'our' Prime Minister (there,I've gone and done it again) - but writing about it personally is quiteanother. This is especially true if you not only see yourself as an internationalist(as I do), but are writing on supremely international issues (what couldbe more international than nation-states?) and what is more, work for the<I>New Internationalist</I>.<BR><BR>So sorry, folks. I've failed you all. An internationalist keynote? OK. Aninternationalist editor's letter?

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>NI Issue 277 - Keynote</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><H3><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="88" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>New Internationalist Issue 277</H3><BR><I>The material that follows has been provided by <A HREF="../NIinfo.html">NewInternationalist</A></I> <BR><HR><BR><h1 align=center>Bullets and borders</h1><img width=200 height=190 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 src="flag.jpg"<br><br><font size=+1>The nation-state is on its last legs - but people are still prepared to die for their country. <b>Nikki van der Gaag</b> finds out why.</font><BR><BR><hr width=71%><p>As I write this, Chechen separatists and their civilian hostages have beenpounded to pieces by the Russian army in the village of Pervomayskoye. Some,to the Russians' chagrin, have escaped, many have died, hostages and fightersalike smashed to bloody pulp. The Chechens were prepared to die - andif necessary to see their hostages die - for the sake of somethingthey prize more than life: a country of their own.<p>Across the other side of Africa, three women sit in the middle of the Algeriandesert. They have eyes only for their work. They are sewing a large brightly-colouredcarpet: greens and reds and yellows and blues on a black background. Inthe middle are the Arabic words: Al watan aw al mowt. A homeland or death.These are Sahrawi women, whose people have been fighting a 22-year battleto wrest their piece of desert from Moroccan rule.<p>And in the rugged mountains of the Pyrenees, Basque separatists gather todiscuss a new strategy - one which this time will involve negotiationsrather than bombs.<p>All three groups of people are prepared to risk their lives in order towin a country of their own. <p>Nationalist struggles have a long history, but the quest for nationhood- often using the tools of violence and, like the Chechens, enduringan even greater violence - is today at flood level. This is hardlysurprising. The nation-state has become the main form of human politicalorganization. Nationalism can and does succeed - though the price canbe very high. <p>More and more new countries are being born. The disappearance of communismalone created 20 new states to add to the existing 165 members of the UnitedNations.<font size=2>1</font> It would seem that our world is becoming increasingly fragmentedinto smaller and smaller nation-states, built around a common language,religion or creed. So the nations who have been hoping and battling forrecognition for decades - or sometimes even centuries - have somejustification for intensifying their struggles for a state of their own.<p>Motivations may vary, but in a world characterized by a 'crisis of ideologies',this resurgence of nationalism is hardly surprising. The demise of traditionalbelief-systems, including the communist one, has left a feeling of hopelessnessand chaos. This makes the siren call to 'national identity' all the sweeter.To claim such an identity is to locate oneself in the world. <p><h3>Imagined communities</h3>So what is this elusive 'national identity'? Is it inherent in each of us,or an artificial creation? Is it true that 'a man [sic] must have a nationalityas he must have a nose and two ears'?<font size=2>2</font> Benedict Anderson, in a fascinatingstudy, defined a national community as an 'imagined community'. It is 'imaginedbecause members of even the smallest nation will never know most of theirfellow-members, meet them or even hear of them, yet in the minds of eachlives the image of their communion.'<font size=2>3</font> Neither language, nor ethnicity norreligion, he argues, are sufficiently held in common to explain what a 'nation'really is. <p>Nationalism, then, 'is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness;it invents nations where they do not exist.'<font size=2>2</font> Politicians are adept at plantingsuch inventions or imaginings in the minds of their people, especially intimes of loss or crisis or change. National liberation movements in Africaduring the 1950s and 1960s needed to re-invent themselves as nations inorder to shake off the shackles of colonialism. As Kenneth Kaunda of Zambiaput it at the time: 'Our aim has been to create genuine nations from thesprawling artefacts the colonialists carved out.' In 1958 Jacques Rabemananjara,the Malagasy nationalist, made another fine distinction: 'One thing's certain,in today's political vocabulary the word nationalism means, generally, theunanimous movement of coloured peoples against Western domination. Whatdoes it matter if the word doesn't really describe the phenomenon whichwe like to apply to it? What fired the activists was never an imagined spectacleof the beauties of the nation-state, but the promise that the coming ofthe nation-state would strike away the chains of foreign rule and all thatthese had meant in social and moral deprivation.'<font size=2>4</font><p><img align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 width=200 height=126 src="page28.jpg"><i>'Nationalism has helped turn the clock back in Bosnia. Here in Tuzla horses have replaced cars, standpipes have replaced taps, but people still retain their multi-ethnic dream'. (picture)</i><p>Another way of helping to create an 'imagined community' is to use the pastto shore up the present. Rooting the community in former glories -imagined or not - helps foster a spirit of optimism in the present.Thus Sim&oacute;n Bolivar in Colombia, Juan and Evita Peron in Argentina,Jawarharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi in India, are all used as icons onwhich to hang the emotions of current nationalisms. In former Yugoslavia,Slobodan Milosevic&#180; linked old stories about Croat atrocities withpromises of Serbian greatness to fill the emotional and economic hole leftby Tito's death. The ultra-right nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky continuallyharks back to Russia's former greatness to harness current discontent. Itis often thus: one ideology of repression replaces another. <BR><BR><h3>Banal nationalism</h3>But the spirit of 'nation' is also kept alive by the stuff of everyday life.The sociologist Michael Billig has a term for this: 'banal nationalism'.It is the nationalism of flags - waved and unwaved; of national anthems;of rousing language ('our country' or 'our nation'); of processions and celebrations to mark nationaldays or battlefield heroics shrouded in the mists of time.<font size=2>5</font> <p>Banal nationalismis the linguafranca that underpins our conscious and unconscious identity with nation.From Washington to Warsaw, it is the fodderon which the media and politicians so eagerly feed. <p>In times of crisis it can easily be turned into what Billig calls 'hot nationalism'- the rallying-cry that sends armies to war, or inspires separatiststo struggle against insuperable odds. For the politician, having an enemyon whom to turn the guns diverts attention from domestic pain - asboth Margaret Thatcher and George Bush found to their considerable advantagein the Falklands/Malvinas and Gulf Wars.<p>A victory gives your nation kudos. This is why war and bloodshed, conflictand death always play a special role in nationalist iconography. It is alsoa reason why women, as non-warriors and thus second-class citizens, areexcluded from nationalist thinking - though of course they may supportnationalist struggles. 'As a woman,' wrote Virginia Woolf, 'I have no country.As a woman, my country is the world.'<p>Nationalism is an ideology which shuts other people out; which defines 'Us'against 'Them'. To call yourself Australian or Chilean or Sri Lankan isto draw a psychological as well as a physical boundary around yourself andthose who claim the same national identity. The fact that 'We' are insidethat boundary, or border, necessarily means that 'They' are outside it.And woe betide 'Them' - be they across the water, or within 'our' countrybut different from 'us' in creed, origin or skin colour - if they seemto threaten our imagined community. We will show no mercy in the defenceof 'our' nation.<p><h3>Ethnicity</h3>Of course not all conflict is based on national identity. And neither isall nationalism rooted in ethnicity. Despite such preconceptions, less thanten per cent of all states in the United Nations consist mainly of one ethnicgroup. Most are polyethnic - Cameroon, for example, has 124 differentlanguages and dialects, 4 different religions and over 200 separate 'tribal'groupings. Many have several large ethnic groups and some - Malaysia,Nigeria, Belgium and Canada among them - are divided between two mainethnic groups.<p>Nationalist struggles may draw their unity from a common oppression by amore powerful state, but in essence they still address 'imagined communities'.What binds them together are those beliefs that their leaders wish to emphasizeas much as any real bonds, ethnic or otherwise: 'Collective memory is usuallyvery selective memory, as likely to be myth as reality. What people chooseto remember depends on their current situations and aspirations. Ethnicidentity is powerful, but it is neither inevitable nor eternal.'<font size=2>1</font><BR>Some categorize 'ethnic nationalism' as purely destructive, atavistic andbloody - nationalisms, as one commentator put it, with the 'brutalface' of the murderer and the rapist. Others eulogize them - the smallagainst the large, the powerless against the powerful, peasants againstkings, David against Goliath. As usual, the truth lies somewhere in between.<p>Our opinions on this depend once again on our categorization into 'Us' and'Them'. We like to think that 'we' are patriotic and 'they' are nationalistic.Or we divide nationalisms into Civic virtue and Ethnic vice. Yet the priceof civic nationalism can often be the marginalization of ethnic minorities.And nationalism may also bring to the fore the best as well as the worstin people: 'In an age when it is so common for progressive cosmopolitanin-tellectuals to insist on the near-pathological character of nationalism,it is useful to remind ourselves that nations inspire love, and often profoundlyself-sacrificing love.'<font size=2>6</font><p>So what then is all this sacrifice for? To what do the separatists, advocatesof self-determination, actually aspire? The answer, more often than not,is a new country, with an independent state to crown their nation. And hereinlies the supreme irony. For while separatists struggle and fight and diein order to carve out a country of their own, the 185 nation-states thatalready exist are growing weaker by the day.<p><h3>A borderless world</h3>The power of global capital in the form of transnational organizations andinstitutions has made a nonsense of national economic decision-making. Backin 1974, when Barnet and Muller wrote their classic study: Global Reach;The Power of the Multinational Corporation, they saw the writing on thewall: 'The men who run the global corporations are the first in historywith the organization, technology, money and ideology to make a credibletry at managing the world as an integrated economic unit...What they aredemanding in essence is the right to transcend the nation-state and in theprocess to transform it.'<font size=2>7</font><p>Today, this transformation is common wisdom. Business Week in 1990 quoted W Michael Blumental, Chair of Unisys Corporation, to the effect that worldcorporations are becoming 'stateless'. They move factories and labs 'aroundthe world without particular reference to national borders'.<font size=2>7</font><p>Capital too is free to flow in and out of the country at the whim of internationalstock and currency markets. The amount of money that moves around the worldin a single day is more than three times what a country like Japan earnsthrough trade in an entire year. We live in what Japanese business guruKenichi Ohmae calls 'a borderless world' where 'nation-states have becomelittle more than bit actors'.<font size=2>7</font> We talk of goods 'made in Britain' or 'madein Japan' or 'made in the US'. In fact, they are far more likely to havebeen made in Korea, assembled in Malaysia, sewn together in Taiwan and thenshipped to the country where they are supposed to have been 'made'.<p>National governments have lost control over another crucial area of 'national'life - communications. Improved technology means that it is no longer possiblefor nation-states to exert strict controls over the information their citizensreceive. In former Yugoslavia, for instance, people from Croatia, forbiddento write or telephone their relatives in Serbia, have been using the Internetto pass messages. In India, satellite television has brought soap operasfrom around the world into the homes of millions of people. <p>But communications and the media are dominated by a global culture whichis increasingly Americanized. American English is the global language andthe US sells its own culture as 'global'. A young market trader in Manilaaspires to the same kinds of things as a taxi-driver in Moscow or a collegestudent in downtown Los Angeles - Levi jeans, Coca-Cola, Western music.<p>Yet at the same time other groups - social, political and ethnic -are rebelling against this homogenization. As Anthony Smith, author of anumber of books on nationalism, explains, these groups are using the toolsof mass communications to 'create and sustain their own... social or culturalnetworks in opposition both to the national state and to a wider continentalor global culture.' <font size=2>9</font><p>Such networks are often formed as people try to wrest control from unresponsivegovernments. Everywhere, direct action - covered extensively by themedia - is having results. Dam-building is halted by those preparedto risk their lives to save homes and livelihoods, road-building is stymiedby dedicated environmentalists - and new countries are carved out bythose who demand a separate national identity. New identities are beingimagined.<p><h3>Failure of the nation-state</h3>The nation-state has failed its people - failed to provide affordableeducation and health services, failed to look after its citizens, failedeven to make the impact on the world stage that those citizens expect. Perhapsits greatest failure is its chronic inability to allow its people the rightto take part in the decisions which are important to them. Governments andthose who run them are increasingly seen as useless, corrupt - or justvery distant.<p>In the words of the UN's 1993 Human Development Report: 'The nation-statenow is too small for the big things, and too big for the small.'<font size=2>10</font><p>So what of the future? What will eventually grow out of the tatters of thenation-state? The historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote in 1992 that: 'the worldof the next century will be largely supranational [and] will reflect thedecline of the old nation-state as an operational entity.'<font size=2>11</font> Others believethat the new entities of the twenty-first century will be based on smallethnic and tribal groupings.<p>There is no doubt that change is in the air. While we now seem to be ruledby an oppressive market - rather than an oppressive state - peopleare increasingly challenging both, and finding ways to shape their own lives.But global problems increasingly need global and not national solutions:'Famines, ethnic conflicts, social disintegration, terrorism, pollutionand drug trafficking can no longer be confined within national borders.'10The nation-state is being squeezed from above by the forces of internationalcapital and from below by the demands of its own citizens.<p><h3>Alternatives</h3>There are options other than a world of global supranational capitalismor total fragmentation. Decentralization may be an alternative to separatism.And technology can be a tool for positive change - for those who canafford it. Links are being made beyond national boundaries. People in formerYugoslavia who are against Serbian aggression are using the new documentwhich outlines the Constitution for a Scottish Parliament in order to establishthe basis for their own kind of multi-ethnic state. Even in the United States:'The great majority of Americans increasingly have more in common with theircounterparts in other countries than with the putatively American wing ofa global ruling class Americans may begin looking past national boundariesfor alliances, especially with those just beyond our borders, physical (Mexico,Canada), or psychic (Western Europe).'<font size=2>12</font><p>We are at present, as the poet Matthew Arnold put it, 'wandering betweentwo worlds/ One dead, the other unable to be born'. We know the old worldof nation-states is dying. We have a chance to assist in the birth of thenew one, to give it shape beyond the parochialism of nation, ethnicity,race or class. Let us be secure enough in our own imagined communities torecognize the value of other peoples' imaginings. Let us take that chanceto create a world that is based on democracy, decentralism and tolerance- a world where a new internationalism is a real possibility.<p><a name="definitions"></a><hr width=71%><p><BR><h2 align=center>Definitions</h2><BR>A <b>Nation</b> is a group of people from the same region of origin who share acommon history.

Its authority oftenrests on a written Constitution.<p>A <b>Nation-State</b> (which we also call a country) in theory assumes that everyoneliving there belongs to the same nation. In practice this is generally nolonger the case. The nation-state forms the basis of international politicaldivisions. There are currently 185 nation-states. At least 15 of these havebeen created since 1990.<p><b>Nationalism</b> is the ideology which holds the nation and the state together.It takes many forms but often involves a semi-mystical attachment to the'homeland'.<p><hr width=71%><p><font size=2>1 States of disarray: the social effects of globalization (UNRISD 1995)<br>2 Nations and Nationalism Ernest Gellner (Basil Blackwell 1983) <br>3 ImaginedCommunities Benedict Anderson (Verso 1991) <br>4 The Black Man's Burden: Africaand the curse of the nation-state Basil Davidson (James Currey 1992)<br> 5 BanalNationalism Michael Billig (Sage 1995)<br> 6 Motherlands: Black women's writingfrom Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia edited by Susheila Nasta (Women'sPress 1991)<br> 7 When Corporations Rule the World David C Korten (Earthscan1995) <br>8 The End of the Nation-state: The rise of regional economies KenichiOhmae (Harper Collins 1995) <br>9 Nations and Nationalism in a global era AnthonyD Smith (Polity Press 1995) <br>10 Human Development reports 1993 and 1994 (UnitedNations Development Programme)<br> 11 Nations and Nationalism since 1780 EricHobsbawm (Cambridge University Press 1992) <br>12 Ellen Willis 'The postnationalprospect' in Village Voice, Nov 28 1996 p 21.</font><BR><HR>&copy;Copyright: New Internationalist 1996 <HR><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif" "="HSPACE=2" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom"" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom>NIHome Page</A> <A HREF="../issue277/index.html"><IMG SRC="../issue277/cover277_thumb.jpg""="HPSPACE=2" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="57" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom"" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="55" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom>Issue277 Contents</A> <HR></BODY></HTML>

I call it the 'sacred hill of directions'. Past a small water-holeand an acacia tree and the hill shifts to your left until you reach a bigMaasai <i>boma</i> (homestead). The route goes on from landmark to landmark untilyou finally reach the village. The open savannah is marked by cattle trailsthat disappear whenever a strong gust of wind stirs up the dust.<p>On this particular day a Tanzanian police officer who recognized me askedfor a ride to the police post on the way. As we drove across the savannahwe saw a herd of <i>swalla</i> (gazelles). My passenger asked me to turn the vehicletowards the animals so that he could hunt some. The police post is veryremote and they often supplement their diet of maize and beans with gamemeat. <p>After driving around for some time with no success I decided that I mustget on my way. It was then that I realized that I had forgotten to takenote of any landmarks en route. I searched the horizon but could not seethe hill I used for navigation. Being midday, it was also difficult to usethe sun to figure out direction. I had a feeling that we were no longerin Tanzania but had crossed the border into Kenya. My companion, however,insisted that we were still in Tanzania.<p>As we drove zigzagging around, a young Maasai <i>moran</i> (warrior) appeared,striding across the plains with his spear over his shoulder. When we toldhim we were on our way to Sinya, he smiled and told us we had lost the waysome distance. I asked him if we were in Kenya or Tanzania. He looked atme and then at my companion and asked: 'Why? Are you Kenyans or Tanzanians?'We replied: 'Tanzanian'. The young man then said with a laugh and a sidelongglance at the police officer: 'You are in Tanzania but you are lost!'<BR>When we finally got back on track I located my sacred hill of directions.I was still convinced that we had been at least three kilometres insideKenya. It eventually dawned on me that the young <i>moran</i> and the police officerhad known all along where we were. But it made no difference to them whichcountry we were in; whether we were on one side or the other of an imaginaryline.<p><center><hr width=71%><p><font size=+1><i>It is only by chance that we are called Tanzanians, Kenyans, Senegalese, Zimbabweans or Zambians</i></font><p><hr width=71%></center><p>This story illustrates the absurdities of the nation-state in Africa. Mostof the time ordinary people simply ignore the borders. They cross them togo to market, to visit relatives and to work. Occasionally a family's homeis in one country and their farmland in another. <p>The borders between countries are lines that were drawn on a map by theEuropeans in order to establish the boundaries of their various colonialpossessions. Most borders divided families or communities that shared thesame socio-cultural history, spoke the same language and were often socio-politicalentities until they became subjects of different European monarchies. Itis only by chance, by the legacy of the Berlin Conference of 1884, thatwe are called Tanzanians, Kenyans, Senegalese, Zimbabweans or Zambians.<p>In 1963 the Organization of African Unity (OAU) established nation-statesbased on colonial boundaries in its founding charter. This locked the newAfrica into the task of building nations and national identities on a colonialfoundation that by its very nature was inherently divisive and contradictory.<p>Then came the anti-colonial nationalism of the African liberation strugglesof the 1950s and 1960s which was concerned with human rights, dignity andself-determination. The nationalist leaders were given a mandate -either by vote or by support for armed struggle and civil disobedience -to secure a situation that would restore cultural, social and economic freedom.<p>On those glorious nights at the midnight hour the various imperial representativesfrom Europe hauled down the flags of Britain, France or wherever, and presidedover the raising of the flags of new African states. On those evenings footballstadiums and meeting-grounds were filled beyond capacity with all the peoplewaiting to experience the collective catharsis of <i>uhuru</i> (freedom). <p>During colonial rule the people and the leaders had struggled together asone. But once the ceremony was complete the leaders went with the colonialdignitaries to the Governor's mansion to celebrate. They drank champagneand danced to European music. Meanwhile, the masses remained in the stadium,drank local brew, played drums, and sang the songs and rhythms that theyand their ancestors had sung for centuries. <p>Those nights were an omen, an early warning of what the future would become.On the one hand there were those people and organizations that advocatedremaining part of the colonial empire with an &eacute;lite sharing the privilegesof their colonial masters, and on the other were militant nationalists whoadvocated sentiments of separ-ation, self-determination and independence.<p>This dichotomy was not just confined to Africa; in the United States therewas a growing social movement which also had two strands - a conservativeintegrationist philosophy and a Black Nationalist movement which expressedsolidarity with African liberation struggles and anti-imperialist strugglesthroughout the world. Some black nationalists believed the solution to liein a national homeland in the southern states of America; others proposeda return to Africa for part of the black population of America. Their objectivewas to build a pan-African movement which would be able to demand that theUS and Europe respect the human and civil rights of black people.<p>The failure of the integrationists to become a successful part of mainstreamAmerica has spawned an adapted black nationalism which has sought to controllocal community economics, social services and politics without breakingfrom or revolting against capitalism and the dominant national power structure.<p>I used to describe myself as a 'revolutionary pan-African Nationalist'.I thought that a strong socialist state was an absolute necessity for Africanfreedom. Further, I believed that a union of those strong socialist states,a United States of Africa, was essential for the freedom and prosperityfor all African peoples worldwide. <p>I no longer think the nation-state in Africa is viable - economically,politically or culturally.<p>My belief and hope that the post-colonial African nation could become aliberating institution for African people has been sobered by the realityof dependency. Today, finance and economic policy are controlled and manageddirectly by the World Bank and the IMF. Political parties, governments andleaders in Africa solicit Western support in order to secure a power-base.<p>The international creditors control all the assets. The workers and peasantstoil and sweat to service debts owed to the international bankers and multilateralagencies. So-called national budgets in many countries are more than 50-per-centdependent on external financing. Development budgets are at least 90-per-centdependent on donor funding. In other words, the African state is in receivershipand cannot operate unless it gets money to do so from Western donors andfinanciers.<p>In Africa today only the symbols of sovereignty exist. There are flags,seats on the UN General Assembly, heads of state (sometimes more than one),armies, national currencies, ambassadors and Mercedes Benzes.<BR>The chain that imprisons African governments and consequently African peoplein this disempowering relationship is 'developmentalism'. Developmentalismis the ideology that believes the state is responsible for organizing societyin such a way as to accelerate its progress into a free-market industrialsociety. This includes a parliament, a stock exchange, shopping malls, highways,automobile factories, pollution and increased crime. The idea of developmentis married to the idea of the nation-state. It is no wonder that the nation-statein Africa, having failed to replicate the Western socio-economic saga, iscrumbling.<p>After 30 years I think African leaders, politicians, and business people,together with the international community, have a moral obligation to cometo terms with the fundamental mistake that was made. Millions of men, womenand children have withstood repression, torture, deprivation, sufferingand death in uprisings, civil wars, border disputes and coups all in thename of nation-building and developing African states in the image and likenessof the industrialized Northern nations. It is too high a price to pay.<BR>That said, does the failure and collapse of the nation-state (in Somalia,Liberia, Zaire and Rwanda) and the general failure of national developmentplans throughout the continent also mean the end of Pan-African nationalism?<p>I think not. I think there can still be a Pan-African unity - but ofpeoples not of states. This unity already exists in its potential form inthe customs and cultures of the people, though the institutions and rulersof those nation-states keep the people divided and exploitable. Just asthey were in colonial times.<p>Pan-Africanism is undergoing a resurgence in Africa, America, Latin Americaand Europe. Young people are exposed to popular culture that synthesizesAfrican, African-American and Caribbean experiences. Many young Africansare travelling and experiencing racism in Europe and America. Emerging fromthese shared experiences and global communications is a global consciousnessof African political and cultural solidarity that transcends the conceptof the nation-state.<p>Transnational Pan-African solidarity is what can liberate Africa from thescourge and burden of perpetual 'Developing Nationhood'. The new Africamust be able to accommodate multiculturalism and the global reality of thetwenty-first century. It must be able to create an environment that enablesindigenous communities in villages and small towns to run their own affairs,control their own resources and benefit directly from the products of theirown labour; and determine their own agenda for prosperity and peace.<p>Countries like Rwanda have a chance to lead the way, to do something different.That chance has been paid for in too much blood and suffering to be wastedin rebuilding the same structures that precipitated the implosion of thenation-state on its citizens in the first place.<BR>So what will rise out of the ashes of the post-colonial nation-state inAfrica? For an answer let us emulate the attitude and adaptability of theyoung Maasai who gave me directions to Sinya. If you need to go someplaceit doesn't matter what nation-state you claim as identity or which borderthere is to cross. The object of a journey is to get where you are going.The object of anti-imperialist nationalism and Pan-Africanism was not thenation-state but rather justice, equality, dignity, prosperity and freedomfrom domination.<p>We have lost the way and it is time to find our bearings, to relocate the'sacred hill of directions' and get back on track. This would be the livingtribute to those millions of African people who perished or are sufferingin the name of nation-building and development.	<br><br><br><b>Ikaweba Bunting</b> lives in East Africa, is employed by Oxfam as a RegionalCommunications Officer and works for the empowerment of African people.<BR><BR><HR>&copy;Copyright: New Internationalist 1996 <HR><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif" "="HSPACE=2" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom"" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom>NIHome Page</A>  <A HREF="../issue277/index.html"><IMG SRC="../issue277/cover277_thumb.jpg""="HPSPACE=2" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="57" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom"" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="55" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom>Issue277 Contents</A><HR></BODY></HTML>

In Europe in medieval times ordinary people owedtheir allegiance not to a state but to a feudal lord. Wars were fought betweenlocal aristocrats -like the Duke of Bourgogne (above) or the Earlof Warwick -not kings or queens. In other parts of the world, societieswere divided along cultural or ethnic lines, but again, borders as suchwere fluid and ever-changeable. <BR><BR><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=center>THE NATION-STATE ARRIVES</h3>The business of nation-building has always been a bloody one. Feudal lordswere forced to give up their regional autonomy by kings who wanted to ruleover larger areas. It took the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) to disentangleEngland from France, and the murder of thousands of Albigensians in theSouth of France to really establish France as a nation. Nation-states finallybecame a reality in North America and Western Europe in the latter halfof the eighteenth century and in Latin America soon after. <p>Creating a nation-state was one thing; making the people who lived therebelieve in it was quite another. As writer and former Prime Minister ofPiedmont, Massimo d'Azeglio, pointed out when the nation-state of Italywas created in 1861: 'We have made Italy, now we have to make Italians.'<BR><BR><hr width=71%><p><img align=right border=1 hspace=10 vspace=10 width=125 height=217 src="india.jpg"><h3 align=center>MOTHER-LANDS AND OTHER LANDS</h3><i>'As a woman, I have no country,'</i><br> wrote Virginia Woolf.<p>In most of the new nation-states women and the working class were not regardedas citizens. Those without property could not vote and they were unableto stand for Parliament. Many nation-states built their identity throughdisplays of military prowess and often by means of military conflict &shyp;from which women were also excluded. Leaders spoke of 'the Motherland' butnationalism was essentially a means of co-operation between moneyed patriarchies.As the vote was extended to women and to the working class, it became necessaryfor those patriarchies to be able to manipulate national identity in orderto maintain loyalty and control.<BR clear=all><BR><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=center>THE NATION OF THE 'PEOPLE'</h3>'The principle of Sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation: no bodyof men [sic], no individual, can express authority that does not emanatefrom it,' asserted the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizenin 1792. <p>American Independence (right, the Boston Tea Party, 1773) and theFrench Revolution created new national models which relied heavily on writtenconstitutions, national flags and anthems. They also introduced a new conceptof democratic citizenship -one which stirred ordinary people to revoltagainst the monarchy. Popular revolts in Europe were paralleled in the NewWorld -in 1791 Toussaint L'Ouverture led an insurrection of blackslaves that produced the independent republic of Haiti in 1804. Patriotismbecame the ultimate loyalty, supposedly superseding all other ties. <BR><BR><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=center>NATIONALISM EXPORTED</h3>As European empires expanded to the Americas, Asia, Africa and the MiddleEast, the new rulers not only imposed colonial rule. They also brought theirown model of the nation-state which was alien to most of the indigenouspopulations. The colonial powers divided up the world along straight lineswhich separated village from village and family from family in the nameof imperial allegiance. Quite different -and sometimes antagonistic-peoples were enclosed within the same boundaries. Muslims and Hindusin India, Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda were played off against each other,and the peoples of those nations are still paying a bloody price for imperialnation-building. <p>As empires shrank and newly independent states declared their nationhoodin the twentieth century, they did so -regardless of political credo-in the manner of those who had colonized them and in traditionalstyle with guarded borders, flags and national anthems. Inevitably theirpower was resisted by those with other ethnic, religious or pan-nationalistloyalties.<BR><BR><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=center>FIRE IN THE BELLY</h3>Of all the main political credos, nationalism has been the most successful.The emergence of national economies regulated by the state combined people'ssense of economic security with their sense of geographic place. This hasproved to be a potent blend to capture hearts and minds. In Russia and Chinacommunism not only failed to subvert nationalism but was taken over by it.Nationalism -often ethnic, sometimes religious -provides a convenientand believable credo for people trying to root themselves in the world.It is something to believe in, to belong to. And it suits those in powervery well. It is easy to manipulate. It is a convenient tool for rulersto be able to whip up support as Slobodan  Milosevic&#180; did with Serbiannationalism. American support for George Bush rose from 50 to 90 per centduring the Gulf War. <BR><BR><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=center>THE NATION-STATE DOMINANT</h3>Today the whole world -with the exception of Antarctica -isdivided into nation-states and criss-crossed by boundaries. National identityhas become as much a part of our psychological make-up as gender, race orclass. The major conflicts being fought in the world today are almost allstruggles to form new national identities -often based supposedlyon race or ethnicity. <p>The irony here is that of the 185 nation-states there are perhaps only ahandful which do not include as part of their make-up large 'minority' groups.Nation-states today are essentially multicultural which is why separatistmovements are often forced to create identities from the past and resurrectformer supposed glories in order to create new 'imagined communities'. <BR><BR><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=center>THE NATION SANDWICHED</h3>But the story does not end here. Though the number of nation-states is stillon the increase -as countries like former Yugoslavia and the USSRhave splintered -their control is being eroded. Many of the originalfunctions of the nation-state -welfare, defence, state ownership ofproduction, railways, and crucially, communications -are either inthe hands of the international community or have been privatized. Giantmultinational companies and international banks bestride the world stage.To quote the UN's Human Development Report (1993): 'The nation-state nowis too small for the big things and too big for the small.' At the sametime, ordinary people have less faith than before in the trappings and structuresof the state -the monarchy or presidency, parliament and politics.Where the state collapses -Somalia, the Lebanese civil war, Sri Lanka-local warlords are re-emerging. The wheel has come full circle. <BR><BR><HR>&copy;Copyright: New Internationalist 1996 <HR><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif" "="HSPACE=2" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom"" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom>NIHome Page</A> <A HREF="../issue277/index.html"><IMG SRC="../issue277/cover277_thumb.jpg""="HPSPACE=2" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="57" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom"" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="55" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom>Issue277 Contents</A> <HR></BODY></HTML>

<p>

Billions of people in the world's poorest countries are enslaved by debt.
Debts run up by governments on their behalf.  Debts which started as easy
credit pushed by rich lenders.  Debts which the poor will never be able to
repay.  Debts which enrich lenders, but leave children malnourished, while
families live in desperate poverty.
<p>

Jubilee 2000 believes the time has come to do something about it.
Our aim is to celebrate the new millennium by lifting the burden of
unpayable debt from the poorest countries.  We have produced 
a clear, workable Jubilee Proposal calling for:
<p>

<ul><li>a one-off cancellation
<li>by the year 2000
<li>of the backlog of unpayable debt
<li>owed by the world's poorest countries
<li>agreed through an independent, transparent process

<font size=4>The events which led up to the genocide in Rwanda had been set in motion
long before.  During colonial times, communal lands in Rwanda were
converted into individual plots to grow cash crops - the most important of
which was coffee.  After independence this cash crop economy continued,
with coffee alone bringing in more than 80 per cent of Rwanda's foreign
exchange earnings.</font>

<h3>1970s and early 80s</h3>

The economy grew at about 4.9 per cent per year (1965-89).  School
enrolment increased.  The recorded inflation rate was one of the lowest in
sub-Saharan Africa at less than 4 per cent per year.  In most areas people
had enough food from their own plots and farms, so imports of cereals,
including food aid, were minimal until the late 1980s.

<h3>1989</h3>

Coffee prices plummeted in the space of a few months by more than 50 per
cent.  Famine swept across the country.  Meanwhile, shops in the West were
selling coffee at more than twenty times the price paid to the Rwandan
farmer.
<p>

Government income fell drastically, and the country found itself in deep
debt. It was forced to turn to the IMF.  A plan recommended by the World
Bank in 1988 was finally adopted.  Under this plan, trade was liberalised;
the currency devalued; subsidies to agriculture were lifted; state
enterprises were privatised and civil servants were dismissed.

<h3>1990</h3>

In September the Rwandan Patriotic Front - a rebel army of exiles - entered
Rwanda from Uganda.  In the same month the Government decided to devalue
the Rwandan franc, but waited.
<p>

In early October, while Government troops began fighting with the RPF, the
IMF agreed to deposit millions of dollars of 'aid' into the Central Bank.
Much of this money was probably used to buy arms.  In the same month the
Government devalued the Rwandan franc by 50 per cent.  The armed forces
increased overnight from 5,000 to 40,000 men - mostly recruited from the
newly unemployed.

<h3>1991-94</h3>

The fall of the Rwandan franc triggered inflation and the collapse of real
earnings.  Inflation increased from 10 per cent in 1989 to 19.2 per cent in
1991.  Export earnings dropped by 50 per cent between 1987 and 1991.  The
number of recorded malaria cases increased by 21 per cent because of
shortages of antimalarial drugs.  Imposition of school fees led to a
massive decline in school enrolment.
<p>

Outstanding external debt, which had already doubled since 1985, increased
by 34 per cent between 1989 and 1992.
<p>

The economic crisis reached its peak in 1992 when the Rwandan farmers
uprooted 300,000 coffee trees because they could no longer make enough
money from coffee sales.  In June 1992, a second currency devaluation was
ordered and fuel prices rose.  Coffee production fell by another 25 per
cent in a single year.
<p>

Meanwhile, inappropriate food aid from the West was dumped on the local
markets.  The entire agricultural system was pushed into crisis.  Neither
cash crops nor food crops were economically viable.
<p>

In 1992 the World Bank's International Development Association ordered the
privatisation first of Rwanda's state enterprise Electorogaz, and then of
the state telecommunications company.  The money from the privatisation was
to go towards debt servicing.
<p>

Ethnic tensions were rising.  Electricity workers were dismissed and the
price of electricity rose at once, paralysing services in the cities.  The
economic shock therapy was disastrous.  In 1994 hundreds of thousands of
Rwandans died in a brutal and catastrophic civil war.

<h2>Creditors reject poorest nation Mozambique</h2>
Mozambique is recovering from a long and destructive civil war, which ended
only four years ago.
She is defined by the World Bank as the poorest nation in the world.  At the
end of 1995 the stock of external debt totalled $5.3 billion and her Gross
National Product stood at $1.2 billion. She is, in effect, bankrupt: she
cannot pay her debts.  And yet, in November she failed to qualify for real
debt relief at the Paris Club of bilateral (government to government) creditors.
<p>

The IMF are not best pleased with Mozambique.  She has 'slipped' on her IMF
programme and, unfortunately, it is the IMF who effectively determine
whether she should get debt relief. DCN and Jubilee 2000, together with our
partners in Europe, mounted an effective lobby in support of her being
allowed to qualify immediately, but to no avail. Not only did Mozambique
fail to qualify, but she was also denied the full 80% Paris Club relief
promised under the HIPC Initiative for bilateral debt.
<p align=center>
<img src="pix/mozam.gif">
<p>


Between 1997 and 2015 Mozambique's debt service to the IMF and World Bank is
expected to increase from $58.6 million per year to $92.1 million per year.
>From 1997 until 2003 average annual (global) debt service payments will soar
to $190 million. Between 1990 and 1995 they stood at an average of $57 million.
<p>

Since 1990 Mozambique has called a halt to borrowing (except from the IMF
which provides her with the foreign currency essential to buying oil). She
has had 12 years of successive Paris Club re-scheduling. Despite this - or,
in part, because of this, debt owed to OECD creditors has ballooned by
almost a billion dollars in ten years. In 1993 Mozambique's arrears
constituted 81% of debt service due.
<p>

And the IMF and World Bank have still to decide whether she would be
entitled to debt relief by the year 2000.

Dear [name of your MP] or [name of Senator] or [Michael Camdessus, IMF Director]

<p>
I am writing to express my concern about the terrible burden of Third World
debt on many poor countries around the world.  The lives of people in many
countries struggling to pay back their debt are made a misery by their
poverty which grows from year to year.
<p>

It is commendable that the (British Government) (IMF) has made proposals for debt
relief recently, but I believe that there is much more to do.  I
would like to ask that you consider a new proposal for the new millennium.
I am supporting the Jubilee 2000 movement, which proposes cancellation of
the backlog of unpayable debt of the poorest countries by the year 2000,
focusing on sub-Saharan Africa.  This would give a fresh start
to those in deep debt, but as it would be a one-off, associated with the
millennium, it wouldn't set a precedent for repeated cancellation of debts.
<p>
Furthermore I believe that the existing process for dealing with indebted countries is unfair.  It is driven
entirely by creditors who are not neutral in the negotiations for debt relief.  Indeed they play the role of
plaintiff, jury and judge.  I want an end to this injustice.
<p>
[last paragraph for MP]<br>
I would be grateful if you could pass this letter on to the (Chancellor) and
let me know if you would agree to campaign in Parliament for more extensive
measures for Third World debt remission.
<p>
[last paragraph for Senator or IMF Director]<br>
I would be grateful if you would inform me as to what further measures you will take to address the debt
crisis.<p>

Yours sincerely
[name]

<h1><img src="pix/began.jpg" alt="How it all began" width=500 height=77></h1>
<h2>Causes of the Debt Crisis</h2>

Many people know what it feels like to owe money, even if only to a
building society for a mortgage.  But it's a different matter altogether to
be deeply in debt and unable to repay it.  And even worse to be in that
situation if someone else ran up the debt and left you to carry it.
<p>

When individuals become deeply indebted, we draw a line under the debt.  That line is called bankruptcy. It is
a line beyond which we do not allow
people to fall. No such line can be drawn in international law. When poor
countries become deeply indebted they fall into an abyss of ecomonic degradation. Their governments
owe vast sums to Western governments
and international, Western-controlled institutions.  These same institutions then take on responsibility for
determining levels of debt relief.  
<p>
This is unjust. It's time we did something about it.
<p>

<h3>In the beginning...</h3>

How were these huge debts amassed?  And why are governments still making so
little headway in the struggle to pay them off?

<h3>Born in the USA</h3>

In the 1960s the US Government had spent more money than it earned and to
make up for this decided to print more dollars.  So the world's stocks of
dollars fell in value.
<p>

This was bad news for the major oil-producing countries, whose oil was
priced in dollars.  The money they made from exports now bought less.  So
in 1973 they hiked their prices.  They made huge sums of money and
deposited it in Western banks.

<h3>Banking on the future</h3>

Then the trouble really began.  As interest rates plummeted, the banks were
faced with an international financial crisis. They lent out the money fast,
to stop the slide, and turned to the Third World, whose economies were
doing well but who wanted money to maintain development and meet the rising
costs of oil.
<p>

Banks lent lavishly and without much thought about how the money would be
used or whether the recipients had the capacity to repay it.  Third World
governments, for their part, were pleased to take advantage of loans at
very low interest rates - below the rate of inflation.

<h3>Dictators' development</h3>

Some countries, like Mexico and Venezuela, took out loans to repay previous
debts.  But for others, this was the first time they had borrowed from
commercial banks.  Many intended to use the money to improve standards of
living in their countries.

<p>

In the end, little of the money borrowed benefited the poor.  Across the
range, about a fifth of it went on arms, often to shore up oppressive
regimes.  Many governments started large-scale development projects, some
of which proved of little value.  All too often the money found its way
into private bank accounts.  The poor were the losers.

<h3>Heading for disaster</h3>

In the mid 1970s, Third World countries, encouraged by the West to grow
cash crops, suddenly found that they weren't getting the prices they were
used to for the raw materials they sold, like copper, coffee, tea, cotton,
cocoa.  Too many countries - advised by the West - were producing the same
crops, so prices fell.
<p>

Then interest rates began to rise, pushed further by an increase in US
interest rates.  Meanwhile oil prices rose again.  The trap was sprung -
Third World countries were earning less than ever for their exports and
paying more than ever on their loans and on what they needed to import.
They had to borrow more money just to pay off the interest.

<h3>Caught in the trap</h3>

In 1982 Mexico told its creditors it could not repay its debts.  The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank stepped in with new loans
under strict conditions, to help pay the interest.  The IMF is a
Western-dominated creditor, which in effect acts as a Receiver but unlike a Receiver makes short-term
loans to help
countries pay off other loans.
<p>

This pattern was repeated over and over in the following years as other
countries found themselves in similar situations to Mexico's.  But their
debts continue to rise, and new loans have added to the burden.
<p>

Essentially, the poorest countries have become bankrupt. 






<h3>Enter the troubleshooters...</h3>

When Mexico defaulted on its debt repayments in 1982 the whole
international credit system was threatened.  Mexico owed huge sums of money
to banks in the US and Europe, and they didn't want to lose it.  So they
clubbed together and got the support of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for a scheme to spread out or reschedule the debts.  
<p>

Since then the IMF and the World Bank - the two main international financial institutions
- have been involved in lending money and rescheduling debt in countries
which, like Mexico, cannot pay the interest on their loans.
<p>

But their loans add to the debt burden and come with conditions.
Governments have to agree to impose very strict economic programmes on
their countries in order to reschedule their debts or borrow more money.
These programmes are known as Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs).
SAPs have particularly affected the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, whose
economies are already the poorest in the world.

<p>


<h3>SAPping the Poor</h3>
SAPs consist of measures designed to help a country repay its debts by
earning more hard currency - increasing exports and decreasing imports.  In
a few countries SAPs appear to have had some good effect; in most they have
worsened the economic situation.  In all countries applying SAPs, <b><a href="silent.html">the poor
have been hit hardest</a></b>.
<p>

In order to obtain more foreign currency, governments implementing SAPs
usually have to:

<ul><li>spend less on health, education and social services - people pay
for them or go without
<li>devalue the national currency, lowering export earnings and
increasing import costs
<li>cut back on food subsidies - so prices of essentials can soar in a
matter of days
<li>cut jobs and wages for workers in government industries and services
<li>encourage privatisation of public industries, including sale to
foreign investors
<li>take over small subsistence farms for large-scale export crop
farming instead of staple foods.  So farmers are left with no land to grow
their own food and few are employed on the large farms.
</ul>

<h3>Jubilee 2000 proposes ...</h3>
a one-off cancellation of the backlog of unpayable debt for the world's
poorest countries - which either cannot be paid, or can be paid only with
enormous human suffering.  This wouldn't be setting a precedent for
cancelling all debts repeatedly.  Rather, it would be a once-only gesture
to mark the millennium, a gesture showing that creditors and debtors alike
have made mistakes and that the slate needs to be wiped clean.  The procedure for agreeing this debt
relief should be undertaken by an independent body, perhaps under the UN.  The procedure will be open,
transparent and fair. This would
change millions of lives, without taking away the responsibility of debtors
to pay their future debts.

<li>For a billion people, development is being thrown into reverse. After
decades of steady economic advance, large areas of the world are sliding
back into poverty.
</ul>

Millions of people around the world are living in poverty because of Third
World debt and its consequences.
<p>

Latin America owes £365 billion in debts to other countries and banks (36
per cent of what it produces - its Gross National Product), while
sub-Saharan Africa owes £140 billion (83 per cent of its total GNP).
These enormous debts mean that repayments to Western Creditors take priority and ordinary people
suffer: in poor health, in restricted access to education, in lack of
employment and in limited ability to trade and provide for themselves.

<h3>Health</h3>

Spending on healthcare has fallen in many of the world's poorest countries
since the 1980s.  This often means that people have to pay for healthcare,
so the poorest cannot afford it and simply go without.  In Zimbabwe
spending per head on healthcare has fallen by a third since 1990 when a
Structural Adjustment Programme was introduced. In Uganda, £2 per person 
is spent on healthcare, compared with £11.50 per person on debt repayments.
<p>

Some improvements in health gained over the 1960s and 70s have been turned
back or stopped in many countries since the 1980s when the debt crisis
broke.  The number of children who die before the age of five, or before
the age of one, has risen in many deeply indebted countries, including Zimbabwe, Zambia,
Nicaragua, Chile and Jamaica, after decades of falling numbers.  Diseases
thought to be eradicated - tuberculosis, yaws, yellow fever - are making a
comeback in some countries as treatment and vaccination coverage declines.

<h3>Education</h3>

As schools are forced to charge fees, fewer people are able to send their
children and education is mainly available only to the better-off.
<p>

In sub-Saharan Africa the damage to education has been particularly
significant: the percentage of 6-11 year olds enrolled in school has fallen
from nearly 60 per cent in 1980 to less than 50 per cent in 1990.  In
Tanzania, school fees have been introduced as part of a Structural
Adjustment Programme, leading to a drop in primary and secondary school
enrolment.

<h3>Employment</h3>

The IMF encourages hard-pressed governments to cut back spending and
downsize government departments.  This often means a rise in unemployment
and a cut in wages.
<p>

Real wages in most African countries have fallen by 50-60 per cent since
the early 1980s.  In Mexico, Costa Rica and Bolivia average wages have
fallen by a third since 1980.  And unemployment has risen in many countries
in Africa and Latin America since the 1980s - in Zambia, Tanzania and
Ghana, over 20 per cent of the working population are unemployed.  High levels of unemployment are
counterproductive as there are fewer taxpayers to contribute to the public purse.  So governments raise
less through taxation.

<h3>Trade</h3>

SAPs mean that countries must increase their export crops - and as many
poorer countries are encouraged to grow the same crops, they cause a glut
on the international market and prices fall.  So the workers on plantations
and farms get lower wages than ever.
<p>

Mexico first grew maize as a staple crop thousands of years ago.  But
today, thanks to IMF economic policies, it has to import 20 per cent of
this staple food from the USA.
<p>

The IMF encouraged Mexico to replace its vital food crops with cash crops -
like strawberries and exotic fruits.  The IMF also made sure that any trade
protection for the country's agricultural goods was lifted.  So Mexico's
export crops now compete with those from the USA, which, as in many
northern countries, are highly subsidised and protected, using all
available techniques to improve their quality.
<p>

Mexico is the loser, and the poor suffer.  Almost 20 per cent of Mexicans
have no cash income; more than 30 per cent make less than the minimum wage
of $3 a day.

<h2>Political Responses to the Debt Crisis</h2>

Since the late 1970s there has been a growing concern in the West that the
Third World will not be able to pay back much more of its debts.  A number
of people from various countries have come up with plans to try to ensure they do.
<p>

None of these plans have been adequate to deal with the whole debt problem.
So although some improvements have occurred, mostly in South America, the
problem remains.

<h3>The Brady Plan</h3>

By 1989 debts to commercial banks were no longer worth their value on paper
because the banks had written off large chunks of them in theory, assuming
they would never be repaid.  Brady argued that the banks should reduce the
actual value of the remaining debt for larger debtor countries, so that
they had less to pay.
<p>

The banks would do this in one of two ways:
<ul type=square><li>by writing off some of the debt with the help of funds from the IMF
and World Bank
<li>by rescheduling some of the remaining debt by converting it into
bonds - which could be sold on the secondary market.
</ul><p>

In terms of total debt stock this plan has not helped debtor countries.  As
commercial debts have fallen, multilateral debts have risen.  Resources
continue to flow out of these countries to pay interest on Brady Bonds.
Debt service was lowered to levels which were already being paid, so no
actual benefit accrued to the debtor country.

<h3>Trinidad/Naples Terms</h3>

John Major originally proposed that creditor countries cancel half the debt
owed to them by the lowest income countries, while rescheduling the rest.
This could have resulted in debt relief worth £18 billion to the poorest
countries.  
<p>

Later he went further and proposed two-thirds debt remission.
In the end, 67 per cent cancellation was agreed at the G7 Summit (a meeting
of the seven main Western powers) in 1994.  
<p>

However in practice, this level of reduction has only been applied to a small proportion 
of poor countries' debts.  Creditors have been very reluctant to offer debt relief. Countries have to keep
to stringent Structural Adjustment Programmes 
to get debt relief and were not exempt from any repayments to the IMF or World Bank.
<p align=center>
<img src="pix/reposs.jpg"><br>
<small>&copy; "Thin Black Lines"</small></p>
<h3>The Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative</h3>

In October 1996, there was a major shift by the IMF and the World Bank when they produced a debt 
relief initiative which contemplated for the first time the cancellation of debts owed to them.  Britain's
Chancellor proposed that the Initiative should be financed through the sale of IMF gold.   The Initiative
proposed  80% debt relief by the key creditor countries (Japan, the US, Germany, France and the UK). The
World Bank announced the establishment of a Trust Fund to finance the Initiative.
<p>

The World Bank has committed resources to the Trust Fund.  The IMF has not.  Instead it will offer cheaper
loans to pay off expensive loans.  There has been no agreement to sell IMF gold.  And the Paris Club of key
creditor countries has not yet begun to implement 80% debt relief.
<p>

The plan is therefore very limited in effect.  Only 3 countries are likely to see any benefit before the year
2000 and they will have to maintain strict Structural Adjustment Programmes.  According to Christian Aid,
only 6.4% of the the total debt of 41 poorest countries will be tackled, while at the same time debt
service is due to rise and commodity prices to fall.

<h2>The impact of the debt crisis on all of us</h2>



The debt crisis is clearly a disaster for the people who live in Third
World debtor countries.  But what about the rest of us?  The fact is that
many of the results of international debt boomerang back to hurt the rich
world as well as the poor.
<p>

Susan George explains in her book, The Debt Boomerang, how six boomerangs
affect the Western world and the creditor countries as much as the indebted
countries: the environment; drugs; bailing out the banks; lost jobs and
markets; immigration; conflict and war.  The following paragraphs highlight some
of the issues she covers in the book.

<h3>Killing the Earth</h3>

Serious environmental destruction began in many Third World countries in
the 1970s and 1980s.  Easy money was available from industrialised
countries for 'development'.  Much of it was spent on large dam projects,
power plants and charcoal driven industries.  These usually didn't help the
poor, and did damage the environment.
<p>

As debts mounted, what poorer countries needed most was foreign currency to
pay back their debts.  One easy solution was to milk the earth's resources
for the hard cash they brought in, and cut back on environmental
conservation programmes.
<p>

Third World countries have done this by:
<ul type=square><li>heavily overusing soil to grow cash crops, often forcing small
farmers off their land
<li>producing more crops on small areas of land, often using chemical
fertilisers, and so degrading the soil
<li>allowing overfishing of their waters, so that fish stocks are damaged
<li>allowing multinational companies logging rights to their forests,
destroying the lifestyle of those who live there
<li>chopping down forests to make room for beef cattle grazing or crop
farming.
</ul><p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=6>
<TR>
<TD>
<font color="red"><b>FACT:  It is the world's largest debtors who are chopping down their forests
the fastest. Brazil is the world's largest deforester and one of its largest debtors,
owing US$112 billion.  It is cutting a staggering 50,000 sq km of forest
every year.</b></font>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<h3>Debt and the Dole Queue</h3>

As Third World countries struggle to pay back their debts, they have to
export as many goods as possible and cut back on imports.
This might seem like a good way to earn money.  In fact they don't earn as
much as they should, because many Third World countries are exporting
similar products, flooding the market.  So prices have been plummeting over
the last few years.
<p>

It is not only debtor countries who lose out by the 'earn more, spend less'
principle.  The countries demanding repayment also suffer economically.
Western countries are losing out on earnings from some factory and farm
produced goods because it is so much cheaper to import them from the Third
World.  At the same time they are not able to export equipment and other
manufactured goods to Third World countries which used to be trading
partners, because these countries have no money to buy them.  So jobs are
lost and unemployment rises.
<p>

<TABLE BORDER=1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=6>
<TR>
<TD>
<font color="red"><b>FACT: Before the debt crisis broke, Europe sold about a fifth of its exports to
the Third World, particularly Africa.  By 1990, it was only a little more
than a tenth.</b></font>
</TD>
</TR></TABLE>

<h3>Dirty Drugs</h3>

Millions of Americans and Europeans regularly use illegal drugs.
Governments across the Western world have poured money into the struggle
against drugs.  The narcotics market in Europe is expanding rapidly,
contributing to social breakdown and violent crime.
<p>

But for all their strategies to fight against drug trafficking, no
government has come up with a solution which tackles one of the factors
making it possible - international debt.  Almost all the major
drug-producing countries also have high international debts.  To repay
debts they need hard currency from the sale of commodities - like cocoa,
whose value has been falling.  Meanwhile, cocaine prices have been rising.
So countries turn to the drugs trade - to raise foreign currency and to
survive.
<p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=6>
<TR>
<TD>
<font color="red"><b>FACT:  Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in Latin America with and the highest 
child mortality rates on the continent. The country has to spend half of all its (legal) export income
on paying its debt. 40 per cent of Bolivia's workforce depend on the drugs trade for a living.</b></font>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<h3>Banking on debt</h3>

Commercial banks have suffered very little from the accumulation of unpaid
debts.  This is largely because Western taxpayers (mostly without knowing
it), inflation, and currency speculation have cushioned the blow for them.
<p>

In most countries banks have been able to write down their unpaid third world debts 
in the accounts as losses .  This means they pay substantially less tax.  Yet the debt still remains and
The debtor country has to continue repaying it. While the weight of the bank's loss is in part 
made good by the taxpayer,  the burden for the debtor country is enormous.
<p>

Another way that banks can gain tax relief on a loan which is not being
repaid is through selling the debt.  In a bizarre system of exchange, one
bank can sell the debts owed to it at a reduced price to another bank which
feels confident it will eventually be repaid at a higher rate than that
discount price.  This is called the secondary market.
<p>

The banker who sells the loan can then claim tax relief on the 'loss' he
has made by selling the loan at a reduced price.  Yet again, the debtor
country gains nothing.
<p>

<b>British Banks</b><br>
The four main high street banks in the UK - Lloyds, Natwest, Midland and
Barclays - have all been involved in lending to the Third World.  For these
banks, though, the worst of the crisis is over.  All of them have sold off
large proportions of their debt by one means or another.  Lloyds, Midland
and Barclays have all made substantial profits from selling, exchanging and
making provision for Third World debts.

<h3>Unjust War</h3>

Britain uses export credits to subsidise arms sales to the South. In
1993/4, 50 per cent of all export credits provided by the DTI to
exporters were for arms sales. In time, these credits become debts for
poor countries. 96 per cent of the debts owed to Britain by poor countries are owed to the
Export Credit Department of the DTI.
Many Third World countries have become deeply indebted because of high
military spending.  And as wars escalate, they are less able to repay the
money they owe.  One estimate suggests that between 1960 and 1987 Third
World governments borrowed around $400 billion dollars to fund arms imports
from industrial states.
<p>

The Third World arms trade has declined after a peak in the late 1980s.
Most of the dictators who invested so heavily in arms are no longer in
power and today's governments are not buying as many arms as they once did.
But the debts are still left to pay.
<p>

Debt can also lead to and contribute to war.  As countries become poorer
because of their debts, one route that people take is violence and protest.
As this escalates, it can end in war - and does in many countries of the
Third World.  As the debt crisis broke in the early 1980s, violence in many
indebted countries around the Third World erupted into war or escalated
dramatically.

<h3>The Latest News:</h3>

<b>April 6th - Jubilee 2000 Day of Action</b><br>
Sunday April 6th will mark the 1000th Day before the millennium.  Various
events are being planned.  In London we hope to unveil a Jubilee clock on a
famous landmark - marking time to the Millennium and calling for a debt free
start for a billion people.  We are also planning to launch an action on the
Oneworld supersite over the weekend.  Make sure you log on! If you would
like to plan something take action (html) and let us know.
<p>

<b>April 26th - Jubilee 2000 Workshop, LSE</b><br>
The fun continues throughout April with our first annual conference.  The
aim is to equip our members with the latest information on date and to share
campaigning skills and ideas.  This year the workshop will be chaired by
Susan George, who is both a Jubilee 2000 patron and renowned for her books
on debt.  We are also privileged to have Paul Vallely, International
Journalist of the Year for his coverage of the famine in Ethiopia and author
of the Book "Bad Samaritans: First World Ethics and Third World Debt."  We
will also have speakers from the South who will speak from first hand
experience of the impact of debt.  The cost will be £10 waged (£5 unwaged).
We have limited space so strongly recommend you send us your cheque to book
a space now.

<p>

<b>Broadsheet Backing</b><br>
Over the Christmas period, writers in both the UK Guardian and Independent newspapers gave strong
backing to the
Jubilee 2000 campaign.  Ros Coward of the Guardian called Jubilee 2000's proposals "a step towards the
future" which makes "other proposals to celebrate the millennium parochial".  Paul Vallely of the
Independent called on readers to join Jubilee 2000
with its "practical programme of realistic measures.  All they need to work is political will."
<p>


<a name="sofar"></a>
<h3>The Campaign so far</h3>

Jubilee 2000 was started by a number of Christians who believed radical action was needed to address the
devastating impact of debt.  Recently it focused around the year 2000 as a useful focus for a campaign 
calling for a one-off remission of debt along the lines of the Jubilee year described in Leviticus.
<p>

It started in April 1996 with the support of the Church aid agencies: Christian Aid, CAFOD and Tearfund.
Since then it has been endorsed by the Church of England Synod, the URC, the Methodist Council and 
is in the process of being endorsed by all the other major denominations.  It has also established strong
links with refugee and anti-racist groups and is linking up with many other national, trade union women and
community
organisations.
<p>

Jubilee 2000 Campaigns are being launched worldwide. There are  currently campaigns in Ireland, Austria, 
Germany, Ghana and Kenya and we are supported by groups in USA, Canada, France, Tanzania, New
Zealand, Australia and many other countries.  New groups/contacts are made every week.  At the same
time, there has  
been a great deal of lobbying of influential decision makers in various governments, the international
financial institutions and other important bodies.  As a result we have established an important network
of supporters who share our objectives.
<p>

We are actively seeking out supporters. However many of our contacts are a result of individuals
contacting us
about getting their local church, trade union, community group to support Jubilee 2000.  So if you are
involved in 
an organisation which may support us, do <b><a href="form.html">get in touch</a></b>.  Only a truly
mass movement will succeed in the
vital objectiv of a debt-free start for the world's poor.
<p>

Our main action at the moment is collecting signatures for a global Jubilee 2000 Petition (which we hope
will be
the world's largest). We intend to collect millions of signatures and submit them to the 1999 G7 Summit
which will be held in Germany. In the UK, we are raising the awareness of Jubilee 2000 amongst British
Parliamentary Candidates in
the run up to the UK General Election.  However we are also planning more events later this year to give
ourselves a high public profile.
We will have more details later.

<h3>Following in the footsteps of the slave trade abolitionist</h3>

Throughout the centuries, when people have joined forces to change society 
they have often, against all odds, succeeded.  One of the closest parallels to 
the debt crisis is the Atlantic slavetrade.  It, too, was a system of international 
oppression accepted forcenturies as a normal and necessary part of trade and life. 
 And it, too, resulted in the West benefiting from the resources of the southern
hemisphere while southern countries, and particularly sub-Saharan Africa,
were devastated.
<p>

But in 1833 the slave trade was abolished in all British possessions.  It
was not because of one powerful individual or institution, but because of
the concerted effort of thousands of people who had become convinced by the
uprisings and leadership of slaves and by the passion of individuals like William Wilberforce that the status
quo was wrong and could be
changed.  Powerful people in Parliament, like Wilberforce, took up the
cause, but it needed the agreement and support of thousands of ordinary
people to ensure the destruction of the slave trade.
<p>

In the same way, the oppression of Third World debt could be ended by the
year 2000.  Then the world could begin the new millennium with new hope for
the poor, and a new start for international relations.
<p>

One major hindrance to the abolition of slavery was the powerful plantation
owners in the West Indies whose interests were best served by preserving
the slave trade.  It gave them pervasive power in the nations from which
slaves came; it gave them trading advantages and ensured that they could
produce good crops and receive good prices for them.
<p>

In the same way now it is in the short-term interest of many Western
nations to maintain strong influence over the poorer countries of the
world.  Justice demands that richer countries give up unfair privileges,
held at the expense of the poor. If creditors agree to remission of debts, the
removal of a restraint on growth could allow poor countries to compete on
fairer terms and reduce their dependence on the rich parts of the world.
<p>

There are people in positions of power in both North and South eager to see
a fairer world with debts cancelled and the balance of power between creditors and debtors altered.  But
the support of thousands of
people in the North is needed to pressurise decision-makers in creditor governments into carrying through
such a fundamental change.

<h1><img src="pix/join.jpg" alt="Membership" width=500 height=77></h1>


Jubilee 2000, part of the Debt Crisis Network, is an educational charity
with a campaigning wing.  We are not a fund-raising movement - we will not
ask you to go out and collect for Jubilee 2000 or inundate you with appeals
for money.  What we will ask you to do is take action.
<p>

We do not want to take funds away from charities working in long-term
development.  In fact we are working very closely with NGOs such as Christian Aid, the World Development
Movement, and
 Tearfund who have been campaigning on debt for some time. Nor do we plan to raise 
money to pay off Third World debts. Instead, we hope to build up a large active membership 
base until the end of the year 2000 when all contributions to our campaign will cease.
<p>

Membership will bring three benefits:

<ul><li>It will enable us to keep you  informed of the issues and of our
progress with a free Debt Cutters Handbook, relevant, eye-catching newsletters 
and updates.  It will allow us to co-ordinate activities, workshops and action days.
<li>As membership increases, the pressure we can bring to bear in high level
negotiations will increase.
<li>Regular membership payments will enable us to maintain a small central
office with staff, produce a steady supply of information, fund research
and promote Jubilee 2000.  Individual donations are welcomed to enable us
to promote this work.
</ul><p>

Jubilee 2000 has produced a workable charter calling for the remission of unpayable debts owed by 
the world's poorest countries by year 2000.  47 Countries are eligible under this initiative.  It has 3
key elements:
<ol><li>promoting understanding that responsibility for high levels on indebtedness lies with creditors as
well as debtors
<li>establishing a new independent process to determine debt relief which will include the views of civil
society and ensure the direction of resources to relief of poverty.

<h2>Jubilee 2000</h2>

<h3>Charter</h3>

Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. Leviticus 25:10 <p> 


The aim of the Jubilee 2000 Charter is:<p> 

 	<ul><li>To liberate the poorest nations from the burden of the backlog of unpayable 
debt owed by their governments to other governments, to international 	financial
institutions or to commercial banks.

	<li>To achieve such liberation, and a return to sustainable development, through 
the unrepeatable one-off remission of unpayable debts of  the poorest countries 	by
the year 2000.

	<li>To provide a focus and catalyst for harmonising and mobilising international 
co-operation, support and actions to promote and achieve this Charter's aim. 

	<li>To promote understanding among creditor nations that responsibility for high 
levels of indebtedness rests with creditors as well as debtors.</ul><p>

The purposes and principles underpinning the Jubilee 2000 Charter are: <p>

	<ul><li>To correct the perverse operation of the international financial system
whereby 	the poorest countries are transferring  scarce resources to rich countries and 
institutions in surplus -  through, inter alia, the Paris Club, the London Club of 
Banks, the IMF and World Bank.

	<li>Through the remission of  the burden of unjust and unpayable international 
debts, to promote economic and social justice and fundamental human rights, 	for the
poorest peoples of the world, now afflicted by such bondage.  

	<li>By such means, to promote the right of all peoples to economic self-
determination; in particular the principle that in no case may a people be 	deprived
of their own means of subsistence. 

	<li>By such means, to restore balance, fairness, equity and discipline to relations 
between international creditors and debtors, to the benefit of creditors as well as
debtors.  

	<li>By such means, to promote the maintenance of international peace and 	security;
help remove causes of conflict and movement of populations -		by  averting the
social and economic disintegration of the poorest and most indebted nations.   

<li>To draw lessons from attempts being made in countries around the world, to regain
resources that have been diverted corruptly, and use them to offset part of the
outstanding debts, and also for productive purposes. This would require the active
co-operation of the creditor nations to which these resources have been diverted through
secret bank accounts.   As well as determination on the part of debtor nations to
establish probity in financial management. </ul><p>

Jubilee 2000's Priorities and Procedures for debt remission by the year 2000:<p>

 	<ul>Subject to the arbitration process referred to below, remission of 100% of the 
backlog of unpayable bilateral, multilateral and commercial debts to be 	provided to
each severely indebted, low or middle income country with strong 	indicators of
deprivation.   This to be achieved through a comprehensive, 	coordinated
approach.</ul><p>

Eligible countries to be those with GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (as defined
by UNDP in Human Development report)  of $2000 or below which meet at least two of the
following criteria: <p>

	<ul>(a)	net present value of total external debt of 50% or more of GNP;<br> 

(b)	net present value of total external debt of 200% or more of exports of 	goods and
services net of imports of food and fuel;<br>

(c)	net present value of  public and publicly-guaranteed external debt of 	200% or
more of total government revenues. </ul><p> 

 	In addition remission on similar terms, to be provided to countries with 	GDP per
capita at purchasing power parity of between $2000 and $3,500 which meet three of the
criteria listed in paragraph 12.<p> 	

	Consideration to be given to countries in exceptional circumstances which do 	not
meet the above criteria.<p>

 	Remission to be based on debt outstanding on 31st December, 1993 plus any 
additional interest due on that debt up to the year 2000<p>

Procedure for managing the remission of unpayable debts: <p>

   	<ul>The precise details of remission (including calculation of the unpayable 
backlog of debts) to be worked out in consultation with both debtors and 	creditors for
each debtor country.<p> 

	Actual remission of debts could be agreed in each case by a small Committee of 
Arbitrators nominated in equal numbers by both creditor and debtor. The 	debtor
representatives should include at least two representatives from civil 	society. 
Appointments to the Committee will be overseen and monitored by 	the UN, or any other
suitably impartial international body, which shall, for the 	duration of the
arbitration, guide the proceedings of the Committee of Arbitration.<p> 

 	The deliberations leading to agreement on remission of the backlog of 	unpayable
debts to be transparent and well-publicised.<p> 

 Implementation of each debt remission package to be the responsibility of the debtor
government, rather than creditors, and to be managed in co-operation with donors and
creditors. This Consultative Group of debtor, creditors and donors to give debtor
governments the leading role in assessing and improving their debt management. The
Consultative Group to be accountable, through the UN, (or the designated body) to the
Committee of  Arbitrators for the long-term management of the debt remission
package.</ul><p>

Conditions for the remission of unpayable debts: <p>

	<ul>In arriving at their decision to remit the burden of the backlog of unpayable 
debts of the poorest countries, arbitrators will take into account for each debtor 
country that country's probity, economic management, social policies and 	human rights
record.<p>

We propose that debt remission should be made conditional upon governments utilising the
financial resources that become available, for investment in basic human needs. Targets
for improving access to primary health, basic education, and water and sanitation should
be established along with the costs of meeting them. UNICEF's engagement with government

for Children is a model which should be followed, with debt relief linked to specific

<b>Telecommunications</a></b><br> 
<blockquote> 



The World Trade Organisation is meeting this week to hammer out an agreement aimed at  committing some 50 countries to open up their telecommunications markets to foreign investment. This month's package examines the implications for developing countries.<p>

Advocates of liberalisation say it will usher in a revolution in efficiency and telecommunications-access in developing countries. Critics fear domestic companies will be swamped by multinationals and that the poorest will continue to be left out of the Information Age. Panos explores the issue in <a href="tel1.html"><b>Telecoms Liberalisation - Bypassing the Poor</a></b>?<p>

A woefully inadequate telephone network is causing Ghana to privatise parts of its telecommunications industry. The process is threatened by a lack of transparency, consultation and  regulation, reports Aida Opoku-Mensah in Telecoms in <b><a href="tel2.html">Ghana - Privatisation Causes Concern</a></b>.<p>

After initial successes, the liberalisation of India's telecommunications industry is tainted with allegations of political corruption. There are signs it is floundering, but it may not be too late. As Mahesh Uppal reports in Do Your Homework - <a href="tel3.html"><b>Lesson from India's Liberalisation</b></a>, the government appears now to be addressing these problems.<p>

For some developing countries, the international accounting rate - the fee they earn every time they receive an international telephone call - is the main source of foreign exchange. But they have reason to worry, writes James Deane in <A href="tel4.html"><b>US to Slash Telecoms Payments to Developing Countries</a></b>.<p>
</blockquote>

<b>AIDS Feature</b><br>
Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is a human rights issue and a factor in the disease's spread. In Tanzania, the problem is compounded by inadequate legislation. Pudenciana Temba describes how the issue is being addressed by civil society in <a href="tanz.html"><b>Hopes for Tackling HIV/AIDS Discrimination in Tanzania</b></a>.<p>

<h2>Telecoms Liberalisation - Bypassing the Poor? </h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>								



Senior trade officials from around the world are meeting in Geneva to negotiate an agreement for liberalising basic telecommunication services. If agreement is reached, it will take effect from January 1, 1998.  If not, the talks will be shelved, probably until 2005. This is a summary of one of the issues examined in a Panos Briefing on telecommunications. <p>

Lusaka/London - Developing countries, who are being asked by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to free up their basic telecommunications services, need to set up effective regulatory mechanisms if they wish to realise the long-cherished goal of universal service - or else it could all go horribly wrong, says a new report by <a href="#panos">Panos London.</a> <p>

Although a WTO agreement will be hailed by some as a major step in improving the telecommunications infrastructure on which most global trade depends, there already are worries that developing countries are being hurried into the global market without sufficient public debate on the implications of liberalising telecommunications.<p>

There are fears, for instance, that liberalisation will lead to telecommunications being developed for wealthy urban businesses, and not for the rural poor.<p> 

"Developing countries are rushing into legislation enabling liberalisation without thinking through the requirements for their people," says Edwin Hanamwinga, a senior Zambian telecommunications engineer. "Legislation will favour Western companies and systems and not the interests of the millions of poor people who have never made a phone call." <p>

Countries signing up to the agreement effectively promise to provide foreign companies full access to their telecommunications markets, and to treat them at par with domestic operators. Already, some 50 countries have offered to open up their markets or commit themselves not to reverse existing liberalisation policies. <p>
 
The talks also include the United States and the European Union's 15 countries, who together account for about 90 percent of the $500 billion-telecommunications industry worldwide.<p>

A key issue before developing countries is the future of universal service - the right to access affordable telecommunications services. <p>

Historically, telecommunications has been seen by many governments as a social good to be promoted at reasonable prices. So, government-owned telephone services have been subsidising the less profitable telephone services - such as those in poorer or rural areas - with profitable services such as international calls.<p>

There is little doubt that telecommunications can help improve living standards in developing countries. The benefits of good communications flow through all aspects of development. Whether it is health, education or food security, telecommunications offers many new opportunity.<p>

In agriculture, using telephones can help farmers get the best prices for their produce. A study in Sri Lanka shows that farmers who used to get no more than 50 or 60 percent of the selling-price for their goods, reached the 80- or 90-percent mark once a telephone line was installed in their village.  <p> 							
Such experiences have led advocates of liberalisation to point to the often dilapidated networks run by state-controlled monopolies in many developing countries.<p>
										
Certainly, the state of telecommunications in most developing countries is woeful. Worldwide, its distribution is unequal - while 80 percent of the world's population has no access to reliable telecommunications, just eight industrialised countries pack in three quarters of the world's telephone  lines.<p>

Africa, which accounts for 12 percent of the global population, has to make do with only 1.8 percent of the world's telephone lines. In Latin America four years ago, there were a total of eight million people in line for telephone connections, with an average waiting-period of more than three years. In some countries, the wait can be considerably longer - up to 21 years.<p>

'Teledensity' - the number of telephone lines per 100 people - averages just 1.5 telephone lines per 100 people in developing countries.  In countries like Afghanistan, Guinea, Liberia, Niger and Somalia,  there is just one telephone for every 500 people.  In Cambodia, Chad and Zaire, it comes down to a paltry one per every one thousand. And the telephones that do exist are concentrated in richer, urban areas. Some 80 percent of Kenyans, for instance, live in places that have no telephones.<p>

But critics maintain that while telecommunications may well become more efficient with liberalisation, it is hard to see telecoms operators reaching out to areas where there are little or no profits. Unfortunately, such areas - mostly villages and poorer parts of cities - are often the ones which also can benefit the most from telecommunications in terms of raised living standards.<p>

"The WTO deadline will push many African governments into cosy deals with multinational corporations," says David Lush, Information Co-ordinator of the Media Institute for Southern Africa (MISA). "This will further marginalise sections of their communities who in the information age need access to telecommunications. Therefore, it is imperative that NGOs and civil society groups have a say in the deregulation debate so that the interests of communities are represented."<p>

The Panos report says one model used by some countries is a universal service fund, into which telecommunications operators have to put a proportion of their profits. Such a fund is up and running in South Africa and could be introduced in Zambia as well.<p>

"The extent to which governments succeed in achieving progress toward wider social goals in the new liberalised environment will depend, above all else on the quality, effectiveness and transparency of the regulation of the telecoms," the report says.<p>

But it warns: "There are real concerns that if governments get it wrong on liberalisation, the effects could last for generations. If governments pay little attention to how they are to develop their networks through liberalisation, particularly to rural areas, they may never get another chance."<p>

<h2>Telecoms in Ghana - Privatisation Causes Concern</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By <a href="#aida">Aida Opoku-Mensah </a> <p>
								
								
						

Accra</b> - When an international company was allowed to operate the first cellular telephones in the Ghanaian capital of Accra in 1992, those  who could afford the service were overjoyed - with good reason.<p>

There are no telephones for those living in Accra's mushrooming suburbs. And Ghana's telephone density is among the lowest in the world, with a meagre 100,000 lines 'serving' a population of nearly 18 million. That means there are just over three telephone lines per 1000 people. <p>

Ghana is not alone in its telephonic misery. 'Teledensity' averages only 15 lines per 1000 people in developing countries. In contrast, three-quarters of the world's telephone lines are concentrated in only eight industrialised countries.<p>

One obvious sign of Ghana's insufficient telecommunications is that people still physically carry messages to each other simply because there are no telephone lines.<p>

"Before mobile telephones, transport was our only means of communicating with business associates," said Hajia Asata, a market trader in Kumasi, about 200 km north of Accra. "You went physically to enquire whether your goods had arrived and you kept travelling between Kumasi and Accra until the goods arrived. Transport costs were then added to the goods."<p>

That makes little business sense. The Accra-based National Board for Small-Scale Industries estimates that up to 50 percent of the working time in small firms is wasted running around in the absence of basic services such as phone, fax and telex. Inadequate telecommunications facilities not only affect the level of export but also discourage foreign investment.<p> 

Large companies, such as the Cocoa Board, who have more sophisticated requirements like datacommunications, have gone ahead and acquired their own closed communications networks for internal use. But private networks mean a substantial loss of income for Ghana Telecoms.<p>

"Even the government has become a victim of poor telephone services," complained one  government official. He claims a government decentralisation programme, aimed at distributing responsibility and local decision-making between the country's 10 regions and 110 districts, has suffered due to the lack of telephone lines.<p>

The government, in a bid to address the problem, launched a five-year programme in 1994 to restructure the industry through its Accelerated Development Programme 2000 (ADP 2000). The programme aims to increase the density of telephone services in the country while allowing the private sector to participate in some sectors of the industry.
<p>
One result is that Telkom Malaysia now owns 30 percent of Ghana Telecoms with full management control. And the US-based African Communications Group has been 
licensed to compete with the Ghana Telecom/Telkom Malaysia venture.<p>

But fears of a bias in favour of foreign investors have prompted calls for fair partnerships and for local interest groups to be consulted and involved.           			<p>

The  privatisation of Ghana Telecoms in particular is alleged to be a political decision - and not everyone is happy with it.  The aggrieved include the Communications Workers Union of Ghana, whose members say they were not consulted before or during the privatisation and hope there will be no massive job losses.<p>

So far, the deregulation and privatisation of the telecommunications industry has attracted  more foreign investors than local ones because the Ghanaian private sector is ill-equipped financially and technologically to compete in this field. <p>

This has given local businessmen a reason to grumble: they say that while foreign investors can bring in financial, technological and human resources, the government ought to be helping local investors play a part in the new telecommunications environment. <p>

That may be a legitimate demand, but without a telecommunications policy that aims at expanding the network to rural areas, all these measures may bring very little overall benefit to Ghana. <p>

The distribution of telephones in Ghana is highly skewed, almost entirely concentrated in urban areas. Slightly over 50 percent of all telephone subscribers in Ghana can be found in Accra. Yet, essential services like hospitals in towns and villages are poorly served. Rural telephony is almost non-existent, although 70 percent of Ghanaians live in villages. There are plans to install 100,000 new lines by 1998 but 95 percent of these will be in urban centres.<p>

Mary Amankwa,  a nurse in Accra, said: "In rural areas where I  have worked, I have seen how lives are easily lost because there are no telephones for medical attention."<p> 

There is also a lack of transparency. It is hard to come by information about whether there are any rules and regulations that have been contracted with the new operators, or whether these operations are in any way tied to the development of telecommunications in general and rural areas in particular.<p>

In addition, there are many technical faults with the privatisation programme, including the likelihood that some frequency bands may become saturated soon.<p>

These problems are linked to the fact that Ghana's liberalisation and privatisation have occurred before the establishment of a regulatory body. Such responsibilities at present are shared by the Ministry of Transport and Communication, Ghana Telecom and the Ghana Frequency Registration and Control Board. Not surprisingly, there is little regulation.<p>

If and when a single regulatory authority is set up, it will suffer from not being able to determine the relationship between the various operators from the word go and will face 
difficulties in bringing to book those operators who break the rules.<p>

<h2>Do Your Homework - Lesson from India's Telecoms Liberalisation</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By <a href="#mahesh">Mahesh Uppal</a> <p>

                    
New Delhi</b> - India's telecommunications liberalisation - involving the largest auction of tenders anywhere - is floundering. But after three years of ad-hocism and fence-sitting amid charges of  corruption, the government appears to have settled down to do its homework.<p>

This may be the best chance yet for the Indian government to see some of the huge licence fees promised by prospective operators of basic telecommunications services. <p>

The liberalisation began with a bang - bids received in September 1995 in response to the government's first tenders were close to a staggering $30 billion. They covered all the 21 Circles into which the country's telecommunications operations are geographically divided. The Circles are graded A, B and C, with A being the most profitable.<p>

The first signs of a telecommunications revolution in India are there to see. The bustling bazaars in small towns and big cities are crammed with shops selling services like long- distance telephone and fax calls. <p>

The government set the ball rolling in 1994, when it announced a far-reaching, clear and ambitious telecommunications policy. It not only opened the field to private investment but also declared that every one of India's 570,000 villages would have a telephone line by 1997. So far, some 250,000 villages - just under 40 percent - have been connected with public telephones.<p> 

The government also promised to set up an independent regulatory authority soon.<p>

The policy's main aims are to reduce waiting lists for telephones, improve the dismal state of rural telecommunications and provide a world-class service at home and in the workplace. The money is to come from both the private and public sources.<p>

But things began to look murky soon after 1995's first round of auctions.<p>

There were huge differences between the bids for the A Circles and the less lucrative C Circles. An unknown company - an Indian-Israeli-Thai consortium called HFCL - accounted for almost a third of all the licence fees offered. It was no surprise when newspapers alleged the company was close to the then Minister of Telecommunications.<p>

The government then declared that all the bids - save five - were unacceptably low. Of the five bids - for a total of about $11.2 billion - four were from HFCL. Only one was for a C type Circle.  <p> 

New bids have been sought twice in 1996. Except in a couple of cases, the response has been cool - the amounts offered are only marginally higher than the minimum price. Half the circles - mostly  the poorer ones - have not attracted a single bid.<p> 

The policy implementation - some say the policy itself - is in a shambles.<p>

								

One of the main reasons for the mess is the way the policy has been presented to the country. Perhaps fearing controversy, the government has tabled the policy document in Parliament with little notice, and few debates have been held.<p> 											
Since its adoption, several major international players have voiced their concern - about the lack of a transparent regulatory regime;  the limit on the licences a company can retain; the one-sided terms offered to the new service providers (close to 70-80 percent of the revenue from each call was to go to the government's Department of Telecommunications); and the lack of price flexibility.<p>

The government response has been sympathy - and a series of  baffling and frustrating  moves. It has backtracked on some decisions and changed others, dithered long over the regulatory body and suddenly transferred the bureaucrat who fashioned the policy, fuelling rumours about differences at the top. To cap it, large sums of money from alleged kickbacks have been discovered at the home of the former Minister of Telecommunications.<p>

"There are two dimensions to the entire problem," Pramod Mahajan, a senior Member of Parliament from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, told journalists recently. "The first is the total lack of a clear policy on telecoms - the rules are constantly being changed along the way. The other dimension is corruption. The present crisis is a clear outcome of corruption in the ministry."<p>

Stung by domestic and international criticism, the government has recently taken several initiatives to speed up the entry of private players into the telecommunications sector.<p>

Some long-standing demands of would-be investors have now been met, including tax concessions and lower tariffs for connecting new networks to the existing one. And
an ordinance to set up the Telecoms Regulatory Authority of India was signed by the President in January. <p>

The process has been a learning exercise for all concerned - but most of all for India's policy makers, still new to liberalisation but aware of the potential the country offers to investors. <p> 

The main lesson from India is that the strategic nature of telecommunications requires it to be handled with political savvy as well as commercial sense. Inviting new players to compete with a government monopoly of over 100 years requires a bureaucracy that is well-versed in the intricacies of business, banking law and technology management - traditionally in short supply in governments anywhere. <p>

The state of  telecommunications in India reflects decision-making processes in many  countries. Where there is political patronage, there is also a reluctance to set up credible regulatory bodies that can reduce the scope for arbitrary action.<p>

<h2>US to Slash Telecoms Payments to Developing Countries</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By <a href="#james">James Deane</a> <p>

LONDON</b> -  In a move that could cost developing countries billions of dollars in foreign exchange, the United States government has said it will withdraw from the global system allocating telecommunications revenue.<p>

The international system for dividing up revenue from telephone calls is known as the 'international accounting rate.' Every time anyone makes a call to another country, the originating telephone company must pay the destination-country a fee for completing the call. For some developing countries, these incoming calls are their single largest source of foreign exchange.<p>

"We are bent on reforming the international accounting rates system," Reed E. Hunt, Chairman of the US government Federal Communications Commission (FCC), said last December, promising to make changes early in 1997. <p>

The system, claims Hunt, is an "ancient, outmoded, pro-monopoly system of settlement payments between countries that has propped up overly-high charges to consumers for international calls and led to a huge outflow of money from the US to foreign countries."<p>  

The US has been pressing for years for changes to the system.  Washington claims that in 1995 its companies paid $5.5 billion to foreign companies for completing telephone calls - $4 billion more than they received from foreign companies. One study suggests that US telephone company payments for international calls to other countries equalled 35 percent of the entire US foreign aid budget annually in the early 1990s.<p>

Opposition from developing countries is likely to be fierce.  For many, the system provides one of the few sources of foreign exchange which operators can draw on to modernise their telecommunications systems. And developing countries often pay disproportionately high prices for equipment purchased from Western manufacturers.<p>

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the United Nations body which fixes and oversees accounting rates, has been seeking a compromise between the US and developing countries.<p>

Around 25 percent of all international calls are made from the US. However, Tim Kelly, the ITU's Head of Operations Analysis, says that US carriers have a huge advantage. "In 99.9 percent of their bilateral relations, they pay out rather than receive and are thus able to withhold payments."<p>
					
The US move has disappointed the ITU. According to Kelly, the US attitude can be summed up as 'We [the US] have calculated what accounting rates ought to be and now we're going to impose them on the rest of the world.'   The success of this approach depends on "how big a stick the United States has," Kelly said recently.<p>					

The ITU argues that the current system does not deliver assistance to those who need it most - only 3.9 percent of US settlements go to Africa for instance.<p>

Some critics say the big outflow of telecoms revenues from the US is not because of the actions of other countries, but those of US companies. 
In particular, they cite the 'call-back' services started by a number of US companies. This system enables subscribers in foreign countries to make international calls - from Manila to New York City for example - which will then be charged to their accounts in the US at the US rate or below. However, the US will still have to pay completion charges to (in this case) the Malaysian operator for what  is effectively a US call.<p>

This, charges Maev Sullivan, an independent telecommunications consultant, is a practise that would be described as dumping if it had been employed in another industry by another country. <p>

Sullivan points out that there are countries such as Hong Kong, who have higher per capita outpayment rates than the US and that, "the sheer size of the US population results in a comparatively low level of international traffic on a per capita basis."<p>

Prof. Jill Hills, director of the International Institute of Telecoms Regulators in London, says that historically, the US has refused to be regulated by the ITU and when not able to get its own way, has resorted to "internationalising its domestic law."<p>

"The FCC's threat follows this tradition," Hill says. "One has to remember that although the US is complaining about payments, its companies are active in call back services - and that increases the US deficit."<p>

Some analysts expect African countries which rely the most on foreign exchange from international calls to be the hardest hit. It is these countries which also have the weakest  bargaining power in international negotiations.<p>

Cezley I Sampson, Director of the Mona Institute of Business, University of West Indies, maintains that traffic flow accounts, in any case, do not tell the full story of the overall balance of payments position in telecommunications.<p> 

"Developing countries operate huge negative imbalances with the US for telecommunications equipment, materials, software and consultancy services," he argues. "Developing countries must, however, adjust to the reality that the market forces and technology development which have been unleashed will continue to result in further progressive decline in accounting rates."<p>

<h2>Hopes for Tackling HIV/AIDS Discrimination in Tanzania</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By Pudenciana Temba</a> <p>
									
 

Dar es Salaam </b>- Tackling AIDS discrimination has moved a notch up in Tanzania's health and human rights agenda.<p>

A group of top lawyers, policy makers and doctors last month agreed to target those found guilty of abusing the human rights of  people with HIV/AIDS. And last summer the government announced plans to ban AIDS-discrimination. <p> 

HIV threatens the human rights and dignity of millions of people worldwide. Until now most governments in East Africa, the region most seriously affected by the disease, have concentrated on policies designed to prevent the spread of the virus. These include condom promotion and information campaigns. Increasingly, however, protection of the human rights of people with HIV/AIDS has been seen as a key element in AIDS prevention. Experts say discrimination only pushes people with HIV/AIDS underground and encourages its spread.<p>

In Tanzania, there had been few formal moves to address human rights abuses against people with HIV, save last summer's announcement. But if the outcome of a recent workshop in Dar es Salaam is any indication, things could change for the better.<p>

For a start, policy makers in Tanzania are being criticised by rights activists for being slow to recognise human rights abuses against people with HIV. <p>

"No cases have been brought to court, few articles have been written and many nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) say they do not have the capacity to deal with the problem and no special programmes had been developed to help them," says Ann Strode, a human rights lawyer working for the United Nations to help Tanzania implement its new anti-discrimination policy.<p>

The workshop on Law Ethics and Human rights and HIV/AIDS provided a forum for views on implementation with doctors, magistrates, policy makers and people living with HIV participating.<p>

The workshop comes out of a UN initiative that has been followed in many developing countries. In 1992, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), responding to reports of widespread discrimination against people with HIV, began to encourage countries in sub-Saharan Africa to establish regional networks on ethics, law and HIV. <p>

Made up of doctors, lawyers, NGOs and others, the networks aim to influence existing legislation and develop new policies to protect the rights of people with HIV and those particularly vulnerable to infection, such as women, migrant labourers and prisoners.<p>  

Tanzania is the fifteenth country to establish such a network - the workshop was organised by the network. Others countries include Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire. <p>

Tanzania is among the countries most seriously affected  by HIV.  About 400,000 of its 27 million people have developed AIDS and 1.2 million are thought to be HIV-positive, according to the World Health Organisation.					more....
									<p>

The number of infected people is expected to double by the year 2000. Poverty, gender inequality and sexually transmitted diseases are believed to contribute to the spread of HIV in Tanzania.<p>

Few formal studies of discrimination against people with HIV have been conducted in Tanzania, but the workshop heard testimonies from six people which illustrated how those infected must bear not only the burden of the disease but also discrimination.<p>

Some had lost their jobs; a widow whose husband died of AIDS had been prevented from inheriting his property; a man told of being tested for HIV without his consent; and another was denied insurance. Most described being rejected by their immediate communities.  <p>

Even medical professionals discriminate against patients with HIV, according to Dr Yohana Mashalla from the Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences.  Some doctors disclose information about patients without patient-consent. Others refuse adequate treatment.<p>

A study in Tanzania and Kenya revealed that some nurses had a negative attitude toward the duty to care for patients with AIDS, Mashalla said.<p>

The workshop heard how discrimination against people with HIV in Tanzania was not only a social problem, but was also rooted in laws not designed to address AIDS issues. Guidelines on testing, control and management of HIV, issued by the Ministry of Health in 1989 and based on international norms, had failed to protect the rights of infected people.<p>

A number of laws, including the Criminal Procedures Act 1985, require doctors to tender medical reports before the courts, exposing people with HIV to discrimination, particularly in prisons.  <p>

Labour laws permit organisations with in-house medical facilities to force employees to undergo HIV testing.  Those found positive are sent home or sacked - so they lose access to medical care as well as employment.<p>

Under the country's Evidence Act, rape victims are required to provide an excessive burden of proof which, according to legal experts, violates their privacy, particularly if there is a question of HIV transmission. <p>

At the workshop, participants recommended a review of the national AIDS policy and changes in the law. There were strong calls for a ban on HIV-testing by employers, and for police officers and prison wardens to be trained on the legal aspects of HIV/AIDS.<p>  

Legal support services for people with HIV facing discrimination are also needed. And a computer database will now be used to monitor rights abuses of people with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania.<p> 

How well the new national networks succeed remains to be seen.  All existing networks will have to present evaluations of their work to the UNDP at a conference in Cote d'Ivoire in May. Observers hope that progress in Tanzania will be swift.<h4><p>

<h4>January 29</h4>

<i>LONDON (Dow Jones)--Multinational oil giant Shell has admitted importing weapons into Nigeria to help arm the police, The Observer newspaper reported Sunday.
The company is reported to have told the newspaper that it has purchased handguns on behalf of the Nigerian police force who guard Shell's facilities in the country because they do not have sufficient funds to equip themselves. Once imported the guns remain the property of the police, and Shell does not have arms itself, the report quotes a Shell spokesman as saying. 
The admission comes after reports in Nigerian newspapers that Shell placed tenders in Nigeria for the import of arms, the report said.
Although the Shell spokesman said that the practice is carried out by a wide range of companies in Nigeria who employ the police to guard their facilities, the report quotes the former Chief of Defense Staff in Nigeria, Lieutenant-General Alani Akinrinade, who said that the police are well armed and do not need anyone to import arms for them.
Respected academic Professor Claude Ake has called on the Nigerian government to institute an official inquiry into the matter, while Dr Owens Wiwa, brother of executed human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa has asked the European Commission to help end the practice.</i>

<h2>Shelling Nigeria Ablaze</h2>

<h3>by

Claude Ake</h3>


Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria shows no sign of remorse for causing the strife in Ogoniland which has thrown Nigeria into one of the deepest crises of its history. It insists defiantly that it will not change its ways and denies any part whatsoever in the environment degradation of the Niger Delta, which it blames on indigenes conniving at oil spills to collect compensation.
<p>Shell's vehement rejection of all blame has clearly undermined the Niger Delta Environment Survey, NDES, which it has been trying to sell as an independent and objective judge, for it has put NDES under pressure to exonerate Shell. In any case, NDES has already ceased to be a serious proposition. The designated representative of the communities has resigned over Shell's role in the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues and doubts about the effectiveness of NDES. The World Conservation Foundation, represented on NDES to give it international legitimacy, is being asked by Nigerian and European environmentalists to resign amidst concerns of receiving funding from Shell. The NGO representative in NDES in [sic "is from"] the Nigerian World Conservative Foundation which was started by a former Nigerian Petroleum Minister who is now a director of Chevron. That leaves apart from the chairman just representatives of government and the oil industry.
<p>Neither NDES nor Shell's well-financed campaigns across the world can hide the disaster it is perpetrating in the Niger Delta. A World Bank Study ("Defining an Environmental Development Strategy for the Niger Delta, 1995") estimates that as much as 76 per cent of all the natural gas from Petroleum production in Nigeria is flared compared to 0.6 per cent in USA, 4.3 per cent in the UK, 21.0 per cent in Libya. The flaring is a serious hazard. At temperatures of 1,3000 to 1,400 degrees centigrade, the multitude of flares in the Delta heat up everything, causing noise pollution, and producing CO2, VOC, CO, NOx and particulates around the clock. The emission of CO2 from gas flaring in Nigeria releases 35 million tons of CO2 a year and 12 million tons of methane, which means that Nigerian oil fields contribute more in global warming than the rest of the world together. 
<p>Nigeria's major oil-producing states, Rivers and Delta, suffer about 300 major oil spills a year (often covering several miles) which discharge about 2,300 m3 (metre cubed) of oil. This estimate would be much higher if it included minor spills which are far more numerous and invariably unreported. It would be higher still if it took account of the fact that the Nigerian crude oil is very light and evaporates rapidly, an estimated evaporation loss of about 50 per cent in 48 hours. 
<p>Neither Shell nor other oil companies in Nigeria invest much in the treatment of effluents. According to an European Community study "Mangroves of Africa and Madagascar", the waters of the Niger Delta contain at least 6 percent of petroleum and often up to 60 ppm. An environmental impact study of Shell (Resigner Industries, 1993) put an average hydrocarbon content of petroleum hydrocarbons in wastewater in Oloma Creek at 62.7 mg/l. At the Bonny Terminal in Rivers Stae where Shell does its separation of watter from crude oil, the mud at the bottom of the Bonny River has a lethal concentration of 12,000 ppm. But Shell lies that the wastewater at Bonny Terminal averages 7.8 mg/l. As the World Bank Report quoted above has noted, the industry is using API (techniques ?) and TPF facilities which are unsuitable for separation of better than 50 mg/l.
<p>While degrading the environment and abusing human rights, Shell and the other Petroleum multinationals in Nigeria firmly discourage resistance against their misdeeds. Environmental activism in Nigeria has thus become as hazardous as the environment of the Niger Delta. Ken Saro-Wiwa was not the only environmental activist charged with murder. Professor Jaja Ohinwa, a former vice-chancellor and spokesperson for the Obagi community in Rivers State, was also charged with murder and detained. He was lucky to escape [with] the dismissal from his university appointment.
<p>In the wake of the Ogoni crisis, another ugly aspect of the methods of Shell and the oil companies has come to light, namely bribing officials to terrorise environmental and human rights activists in the oil producing communities. In the last two weeks, Nigerian newspapers and even some foreign ones have carried reports accusing Shell of giving money to some state officials in the oil-producing communities to conduct punitive security operations. I call for an independent investigation of this matter, especially the issues raised by the editorial in AM News of Monday, January 8, 1996.
<p>On several occasions, I have raised the question of the privatisation of the state by Shell with Shell officials. The privatisation of the state is evident in the swarm of police men and women in Shell residential headquarters and offices supposedly securing Shell; the presence of armed troops in the operational bases of the company, and in the prerogative of Shell and other oil companies to call on the police and the military for their security. In 1989, Shell called in the Mobile Police Force into Umuechem where it was having problems with the community and blood was shed. By official accounts, 15 people were shot in the single operation but newspaper reports indicate the death toll of about 80 persons.
<p>It is indicative of Shell's privatisation of the state and its prerogatives that it buys substantial quantities of firearms thorugh open tender for its own use. ThisDay of Friday, December 22, 1995 reports a case before a Lagos High Court in which an arms dealer, Humanitex Nigeria Limited, sued Shell Nigeria for N100 million (?) for a breach of contract in seeking to open again for bidding an arms supply contract which Shell awarded in 1993. In a 17-paragraph affidavit sworn by the chief executive of the company, Gabriel Akinluyi, the company says that Shell was making the purchase to update the firearms of its security forces across the country. We see here the bizarre and frightening novelty of accumulation of terror. I call for an independent inquiry inot the acquisition and use of firearms by Shell. 
<p>These tendencies have been replayed in Ogoniland on an extended scale with more tragic consequences. By all indications, there is worse to come. Shell remains unrepentant and belligerent. At the same time, consciousness and resentment [grow ?] in the oil-producing communities as the events of January 4, 1996 [Ogoni Day] showed. Ogoniland is unbowed. Unless something gives there will be more strife and they will be far more catastrophic. 
<p>What is at issue is nothing less than the viability of Nigeria, as oil is the real power and the stuff of politics in Nigeria as well as what holds the country in a fragile dialectical unity of self-seeking. It is time to call Shell to order and to account. 
<p><hr>
Professor Claude Ake is a Nigerian National Merit Award winner, and Director of the Centre for Advanced Social Science, Port Harcourt. Following the judicial murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others by the Abacha junta on November 10, 1995, Ake angrily resigned from an advisory committee (NDES) to Shell Co. on environmental impact assessment of that oil company's operation in the Niger Delta region, claiming as he has again stated above that Shell was complicit in the conflict.

<h3>EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT - OGONI DAY 1996 IN NIGERIA</h3>

Last Thursday, January 4, 1996 was Ogoni Day. Despite the occupation of Ogoni villages by the Internal Security Task Force now led by Major Obi Umahi (Col. Paul Okuntimo's replacement), over 100,000 Ogonis participated in the massive non-violent demonstrations, resisting intimidation and provocation by the military. Even Ledum Mitee, current head of MOSOP, and recently released by the military-appointed tribunal that convicted the November-10-executed Ogoni Nine (including Ken Saro-Wiwa), slipped the military surveillance to return to his home village (K.Dere) in Ogoniland with his younger brother Batom Mitee to take part in the event.

<p>Ledum Mittee spoke on the phone today, January 9, with adjunct professor of History Louis Sigel of the University of South Maine, Portland (he is also a local official of Amnesty International and has been following the Ogoni crises closely). From their brief conversation, Prof. Sigel filed this report with NDM News.............

<p>The scene was reminiscent of the pre-ban Ogoni Day outpouring of people and spirit in 1993 that was so inspiring to Ken Saro-Wiwa. The Ogoni had finally fulfilled their determination to celebrate Ogoni Day 1996 "in the bush" if necessary. 

<p>The Internal Security Task Force vented their frustration that their threats failed to prevent Ogoni Day observances by firing into the crowd, killing six unarmed men. Tens of others were beaten and arrested, some of whom remain in custody. The body of one of the six murdered men was thrown into the river, but it was later recovered and buried.

<p>Major Obi Umahi, as commander of the Internal Security Task Force, continued Okuntimo's policy of vicious midnight raids on sleeping Ogoni villages. On the evening of Ogoni Day, several villages suffered these raids which were marked by indiscriminate firing into the huts of sleeping families, breaking and looting people's homes, and raping of women.

<p>The military broke up Bori market on Friday, January 5, in retaliation for the cancelling of the market on Thursday to observe Ogoni Day. Throughout Ogoniland, the members of the task force were carrying out an intensive manhunt to find the activists that they have identified as leaders in the Ogoni Day observances. The military was also carrying out house searches to find and destroy any videos documenting Ogoni Day celebrations.

<p>Ledum Mitee and his brother were briefly detained by the military and their videocamera was seized and not returned when they were released. During his time in custody, Ledum Mitee witnessed that Paul Adams, the Lagos-based correspondent of the Financial Times of London, was held for questioning. Ledum Mitee was unable to find out how Paul Adams was dealt with by the task force. 

<p>On his release, Ledum Mitee was informed by Major Umahi that his movements will be more restricted in the future. He is not free to leave Port Harcourt and return to Ogoniland without prior notication of his travel plans to the task force, which will provide a security escort. Major Umahi also issued an ominous threat about Ledum Mitee's fate if he should fail to abide by this new restriction.

<p><h3>NDM Commentary:</h3>

<p>The new round of intimidation being meted out on the Ogoni in their expression of solidarity, human dignity and genuine bereavement for the loss of their community leaders must stop. This military junta deserves nothing but contempt and opprobrium for its continued crimes.

<p>We commend the indomitable spirit of the Ogoni and urge them to continue to express themselves non-violently and with courage. They should be assured that day follows night.

<p><h3>RELATED NEWSWIRE ITEMS</h3>

<p>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) - Jan. 8 - A British journalist working for the Financial Times of London has been arrested in Nigeria's volatile Ogoniland, his newspaper said Monday. 

<p>It said in a statement circulated in Lagos that Paul Adams, the Financial Times correspondent here since 1993, had been detained since Thursday by Nigeria's State Security Service. 

<p>There has been no official comment on Adam's detention. 

<p>His paper said he was arrested in Bori, the main town in Ogoniland in southeast Nigeria. It said he was on a reporting trip to the area where there have been protests against pollution by oil firms and demands by the local people for a greater share of oil revenues.

<p>Nine Ogoni minority rights activists including the author Ken Saro-Wiwa were hanged last November, triggering widespread condemnation of Nigeria's military rulers and a series of sanctions against the politically-troubled West African nation. 

<p>Adams is now held in Port Harcourt, capital of the southeastern Rivers state which includes Ogoniland, the Financial Times said. An official of the British High Commission (embassy) had met him there for 30 minutes, the newspaper said. 

<p>Diplomatic efforts were continuing to secure his release and further meetings would be held Tuesday between British and Nigerian officials, both in Port Harcourt and Lagos, it said. 

<p>In June 1991, a previous military government expelled the then Financial Times correspondent in Nigeria, William Keeling, after a a report he wrote alleging misuse of the windfall in oil revenues arising from the Gulf crisis at the time.

<P>Dear friends, supporters and interested readers,<BR>
<BR>
At last, we have our own site where we can keep you in touch with<BR>
the Ogoni news and the issues which are important for all<BR>
minority groups on this planet. We have to thank all the Oneworld<BR>
Online team who have to date been making sure that the problems<BR>
of the Ogoni's have not gone unnoticed on the Internet. Now we<BR>
have been given the opportunity to get the message out to you<BR>
with our own site and we hope that we will be able to make a good<BR>
job of it.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>THE OGONI COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION</H3>
<BR>
The Ogoni Community Association - United Kingdom (OCA-UK), was<BR>
set up in 1993 by Ogoni people living in Britain as an affiliate<BR>
of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People. <BR>
Its remit is to focus world attention on the plight of the Ogoni<BR>
people through peaceful and non-violent campaigning and to<BR>
support and promote their emancipation through the Ogoni Bill of<BR>
Rights adopted by general acclaim of the Ogoni people on the 26th<BR>
day of August 1990 at Bori, Rivers State, Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>THE OGONI FOUNDATION</H3>
<BR>
The Ogoni Foundation has been set up by the OCA-UK to relieve<BR>
poverty and sickness by appropriate charitable (whether medical<BR>
rehabilitation, financial or other) assistance in any part of the<BR>
world and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality<BR>
of the foregoing) by the provision of aid to the needy in Nigeria<BR>
or persons formerly resident there. It also aims to advance the<BR>
education of people living in the United Kingdom and Nigeria in<BR>
the Ogoni languages and traditions and cultures by the provision<BR>
of a Saturday school. Finally, it will help to protect and<BR>
preserve the environment in Africa and other parts of the world<BR>
by the provision of educational leaflets and projects and by<BR>
assisting the local conservation projects.<BR>

WHAT IS HAPPENING?</H3>
<BR>
Our first item brings back the memory of Ken Saro-Wiwa and raises<BR>
a few of the issues which are still important after his death.<BR>
<H4>A LETTER BY KEN SARO-WIWA</H4>
<BR>
29th July<BR>
<BR>
The Editor<BR>
The Guardian<BR>
London<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
I wish to thank you for publishing my letter in your edition of<BR>
18th may, 1995. Since that publication, I have received numerous<BR>
letters of support from the British public. As I have not been<BR>
able to answer these letters individually, please permit me to<BR>
thank, through you, all those who have sent me cheering words of<BR>
encouragement and solidarity.<BR>
<BR>
Most of those who have written have indicated their intention to<BR>
write to the British Government, their MP's or EP's, party<BR>
leaders, Amnesty International or the Nigerian Government. All<BR>
of which are welcome, and in place. Except that my predicament,<BR>
and the predicament of the Ogoni people require just a little<BR>
more urgency, in a different direction.<BR>
<BR>
At the root of my travails lies Shell, the multi-national oil<BR>
giant which has exploited, traduced and driven the Ogoni people<BR>
to extinction in the last three decades. The company has taken<BR>
over 30 billion dollars out of Ogoni and has left a completely<BR>
devastated environment and a trail of human misery.<BR>
<BR>
When I organised the Ogoni people to peacefully protest Shell's<BR>
ecological war, the Company, without the least hesitation or<BR>
compunction, invited the Nigerian military to use the lethal arms<BR>
supplied by the British Government on unarmed Ogoni people while<BR>
they were sleeping in their beds. Thousands have been murdered,<BR>
hundreds of thousands driven into the bush and tents of villages<BR>
flattened to the ground.<BR>
<BR>
Shell's coup de grace has been to goad their ally, the Nigerian<BR>
military dictatorship, to arraign me before a kangaroo military<BR>
Tribunal whose manifest unfairness and injustice have been<BR>
condemned by Article 19 (ed. International Centre on Censorship),<BR>
the Law Society of England and Wales and the Bar Human Rights<BR>
Committee of England and Wales which jointly sent a British QC,<BR>
Michael Birnbaum, to watch the Tribunal at work and play. For<BR>
good measure, Shell is represented by counsel, said to be holding<BR>
a watching brief for the Company, in what is supposed to be a<BR>
criminal trial. What the company is doing is supervising an<BR>
gloating over my torture and inevitable condemnation. Which is<BR>
meant to show the people's of the Niger delta that they dare not,<BR>
cannot, challenge the destruction of their environment by<BR>
almighty Shell.<BR>
<BR>
The World Bank, after studying the Niger delta, has warned that<BR>
&quot;an urgent need exists to implement mechanisms to protect the<BR>
life and health of the region's inhabitants and its ecological<BR>
systems from further deterioration.&quot;. The European Parliament has<BR>
also stated that oil exploration in the Niger delta has turned<BR>
the area into an &quot;environmental nightmare&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of facing the consequences of its ecological war on the<BR>
delta, stopping that war and paying reparations to its victims,<BR>
Shell is coldly planning and executing the destruction of vocal<BR>
opposition as led by me. And given the brutal nature of the<BR>
current military dictatorship in Nigeria which depends entirely<BR>
on the petrodollars and diplomatic support supplied by Shell,<BR>
there is little doubt that Shell will see me to the gallows or<BR>
have me shut up as soon as possible. (note: Shell's involvement<BR>
in making an appeal for clemency was too little and came too<BR>
late.)<BR>
<BR>
I have one suggestion for those whose conscience has been<BR>
disturbed by my story: boycott all Shell products. Picket Shell<BR>
garages. Do not allow them to profit by their destruction of the<BR>
people and ecology of the Niger delta.<BR>
<BR>
And, lest I forget, please do not allow the kangaroo military<BR>
tribunal which is supposedly trying me to condemn me to death for<BR>
a crime I know nothing about and you then make appeals for<BR>
clemency to a military dictatorship which has neither legitimacy,<BR>
nor conscience. Support the call for worldwide boycott of<BR>
Nigerian oil. Help destroy what the Wall Street Journal calls the<BR>
&quot;slick alliance&quot; of Shell and the Nigerian military dictators
and<BR>
so save life and the environment of the Niger delta.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the oil fields of Ogoni<BR>
laughter lies buried in blow-outs,<BR>
death romps to the drums of greed<BR>
in thick shells of earth's riches.<BR>
On the oil fields of Ogoni<BR>
exploring black gold efficiently<BR>
is the maxim of the mad mogul<BR>
and human life but cold obstacle<BR>
in the frenzied path of a search<BR>
guided by blood and flow charts,<BR>
margins, murder, rigs and leases<BR>
and out of season christmas trees.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ken Saro-Wiwa<BR>
Port Harcourt<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>This letter, written by Ken from his prison cell has a terrible<BR>
ring of premonition. We all know that Ken's life was taken from<BR>
him at 11.30am on friday 10th November 1995, together with Dr.<BR>
Bariem Kiobel, John Kpuinen, Baribo Bera, Saturday Dobee, Felix<BR>
Nwate, Nordu Eawo, Paul Levura and Daniel Gbokoo. It seems now<BR>
that General Abacha, the military dictator responsible for the<BR>
death of these courageous men, is trying to lay the blame on the<BR>
men who advise him. Let us make our stand point clear: anyone who<BR>
did not publicly speak out in defence of these nine men, and<BR>
certainly all those who were in a position of power to prevent<BR>
this act of murder, can find no peace and no excuse for their<BR>
actions. Ken Saro-Wiwa, a very great man, with a vision that was<BR>
important for all threatened peoples, is no longer and nothing<BR>
can bring him back. We take strength in the legacy that he left<BR>
behind - the will to fight, peacefully, for our rights and for<BR>
the rights of all minorities over this whole planet. OCA-UK<BR>
supports a boycott of Shell because Shell has got to realise that<BR>
they cannot destroy an area and get away with it. OCA-UK supports<BR>
an oil embargo of Nigeria because it is oil which sustains the<BR>
military dictatorship and it is an oil embargo that will cause<BR>
its downfall.<BR>

PROFESSOR CLAUDE AKE RESIGNS FROM THE NDES</H3>
<BR>
The next piece of news we have for you is a press statement by<BR>
Professor Claude Ake. Professor Ake is the Director of a think<BR>
tank called the Center for Advanced Social Science (CASS), based<BR>
in Nigeria. He is also laureate of the Nigerian National Order<BR>
of Merit, Nigeria's most coveted honour. He was a good friend to<BR>
Ken Saro-Wiwa and when Ken was in detention visited him and<BR>
helped to raise his morale. Professor Ake is not an Ogoni but<BR>
when he decided to serve on the Niger Delta Environment Survey<BR>
(NDES) we were very pleased since he would be an impartial,<BR>
honest and reliable representative. In the beginning, we<BR>
encouraged the formation of the NDES, though always made clear<BR>
our reservations and the need to take not only the science of the<BR>
environment into account but also the social and economic<BR>
aspects. Professor Ake's press statement says the rest for us.<BR>
<H4>PRESS STATEMENT</H4>
<H2>Resignation from the Steering Committee<BR>
of the Niger Delta Environment Survey</H2>
<BR>
      It is with regret that I announce my resignation from the<BR>
Steering Committee of the Niger Delta Environmental Survey (NDES)<BR>
which took effect from November 16, 1995.<BR>
<BR>
      I must confess that the decision to serve on that committee<BR>
has been a difficult one to begin with given the oil companies'<BR>
past record of arrogance, insensitivity to the humanity of host<BR>
communities and to environmental sustainability. But in the end<BR>
I decided to serve encouraged by Ken Saro-Wiwa who argued that<BR>
NDES could be a window of opportunity for constructive<BR>
engagement.<BR>
<BR>
      Having decided to serve, I suspended my doubts and tried to<BR>
believe that the oil industry in Nigeria might quite conceivably<BR>
be willing to live up to its social responsibilities. As the<BR>
designated &quot;representative&quot; of the communities in the Committee,<BR>
I tried to sensitize the Committee to community concerns and to<BR>
develop a mechanism to facilitate communications between NDES in<BR>
particular and the Oil industry in general with Communities. This<BR>
was reflected in the fact that at the stake holders meeting in<BR>
Port Harcourt on October 24, the Ijaw National Congress, Ogbakor<BR>
Ikwerre, Ogba Solidarity, Ogbakor Etche, Movement for the<BR>
Survival of the Ogoni People, Oyigbo Forum, Bonny Indigenous<BR>
Peoples Federation, Ndoni Community Association, Uzugbari Ekpeye<BR>
and O'Elobo Eleme presented a common position paper on NDES and<BR>
it was clear that the acknowledged success of the meeting was<BR>
partly due to the fact that despite their doubts they too felt<BR>
that something positive could come out of NDES.<BR>
<BR>
      Unfortunately, the realities intruded. It was clear that<BR>
NDES did not have the enthusiastic support of the Oil industry.<BR>
Apart from that, there was nothing in the posture and practices<BR>
of the major oil companies, Shell, NAOC, Elf and Mobil to signal<BR>
the fact that NDES could be regarded as a forward movement.<BR>
Rather as the agenda of NDES developed, it became difficult<BR>
despite the good number of competent and well-meaning people on<BR>
the Steering Committee to expect much from NDES.<BR>
<BR>
      I was already seriously considering resignation before the<BR>
tragic turn of the Ogoni struggle culminating in the execution<BR>
of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues. I do not think that the oil<BR>
industry in Nigeria, particularly Shell whose crude practises and<BR>
insensitivity engendered the struggle in the first place did<BR>
enough to diffuse the situation.<BR>
<BR>
      Their reaction to the tragedy was more unfortunate still.<BR>
They have in effect been assuring everyone who cares to listen<BR>
that nothing has changed and nothing will change. I cannot help<BR>
thinking that even silence would have been better than such<BR>
unfeeling belligerence. For, given the rising tide of resentment<BR>
in the oil producing communities, this posture is bound to be<BR>
catastrophic for Nigeria and self-defeating for the oil<BR>
companies.<BR>
<BR>
      These circumstances have left me no choice but to resign.<BR>
For they have, to my mind, transformed NDES into an unwelcome<BR>
diversion and rendered it morally unacceptable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Claude Ake<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>We are now waiting to see what will happen with the Steering<BR>
Committee in which we now have little confidence.<BR>

OGONI UPDATE</H3>
<BR>
The situation in Ogoni remains critical. The army is there is<BR>
full force and strip searches in the middle of the street are not<BR>
uncommon. Church services are still being disrupted with no<BR>
mention of Ken Saro-Wiwa allowed. In fact, Ogoni has not been<BR>
allowed to mourn their leader; any mention of his name and a time<BR>
in a prison cell awaits you. <BR>
<BR>
In January another 19 Ogoni's will face the same kangaroo<BR>
Tribunal as Ken and the others. What does it take for the world<BR>
to wake up to the Nigerian repression? Does there need to be<BR>
another death or even 19? Are not the conditions in Ogoni already<BR>
enough to call for an oil boycott? We fear for the lives of all<BR>
Ogoni's and we hope against hope that the 19 men who are facing<BR>
the death penalty without right of appeal will be exonerated. In<BR>
a later issue we will tell you more about the 19 men. For now,<BR>
remember these names:<BR>

<BR>
In the last few days we have heard that the Nigerian military<BR>
government is putting pressure on Ogoni chiefs to sign a document<BR>
to allow Shell back into Ogoni. Do not therefore be surprised to<BR>
read or hear that the Ogoni's have &quot;permitted&quot; Shell back into<BR>
Ogoni and that there is written evidence of this. This evidence<BR>
will have been obtained through the barrel of a gun and not<BR>
voluntarily given.<BR>

<H3>THE LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS PROJECT</H3>
<BR>
You may well have read in the papers that Shell and the Nigerian<BR>
LNG Ltd. have decided to go ahead with the Liquified Natural gas<BR>
(LNG) project. They have sold this project to the general public<BR>
as being the environmental answer. We refute this, since<BR>
technical reports show that all of the gas in the first years and<BR>
most of the gas subsequently, will come from new gas reserves and<BR>
not from gas that is currently being flared.<BR>
<BR>
Shell claimed to have carried out a comprehensive environmental<BR>
impact assessment (EIA) for the LNG project. An independent<BR>
consultant has been hired to assess the EIA and the results are<BR>
damning. Our press release on the subject reads as follows:<BR>
<H4>PRESS RELEASE</H4>
<BR>
dated 11th December 1995<BR>
<H2>NEW INDEPENDENT EVALUATION SHOWS SHELL'S<BR>
LACK OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT</H2>
<BR>
The Ogoni Community Association UK are pleased that a new<BR>
document confirms their suspicions about poor environmental<BR>
statements which were prepared for the Nigerian Liquified Natural<BR>
Gas project. This is a project which Shell Petroleum has<BR>
committed their support to.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are vindicated&quot; says Lazarus Tamana, President of the Ogoni<BR>
Community Association UK. &quot;We knew all along these environmental<BR>
Statements for the Liquified Natural Gas project were not<BR>
thoroughly researched. They were simply not up to acceptable<BR>
standards as far as we were concerned.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The new review shows how shallow the investigation of the<BR>
environmental impact of the LNG project was. According to Shell,<BR>
the prime reason for investing in this project was that if they<BR>
pulled out the &quot;environment would be hurt&quot; and that the LNG<BR>
&quot;plant will bring more benefits, with a great reduction in the<BR>
need for gas flaring by the oil industry.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
However, the review of the environmental statements shows us that<BR>
the Nigerian LNG investigation was incredibly superficial. The<BR>
independent review prepared by Dr. Phil Smith of Aquatic<BR>
Environmental Consultants, tells us the Nigerian environmental<BR>
report is &quot;repetitive&quot; and &quot;unilluminating&quot;. In addition
they<BR>
state &quot;there is a lack of local inputs on the ecology and socio-<BR>
economics of the study area.&quot; This has always been one of the<BR>
prime concerns held by OCA-UK.<BR>
<BR>
In contradiction to Shell's stated objectives - to reduce the<BR>
quantity of gas flaring in the region - Dr. Smiths review states:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The reports do not appear to contain any information on how much<BR>
gas flaring will be reduced by the collection of gas. Without<BR>
this information the importance of the scheme in reducing gas<BR>
flaring cannot be assessed, and any environmental benefits from<BR>
reduced gas flaring are unquantified.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lazarus Tamana said &quot;rather than taking firm steps to benefit the<BR>
environment, Nigerian LNG Ltd. is commissioning empty, vacuous<BR>
and insubstantial reports. I am pleased to see that the review<BR>
by the Aquatic Environmental Consultants simply strengthens our<BR>
case.&quot;<BR>

QUESTIONS? AND ANSWERS</H3>
<BR>
There has been a lot of media coverage of the Ogoni issue and we<BR>
are pleased that so many people are interested in our struggle.<BR>
However, the coverage has not always been totally accurate and<BR>
may have led to questions forming in your mind about some of the<BR>
issues. Well, this is the place where we will try to answer any<BR>
queries you have. Send us your questions (address at the end) and<BR>
mention that you read this on our web site so that we can either<BR>
answer you on this site or personally.<BR>
<BR>
There has also been some 'fight-back' press from Shell, including<BR>
some advertisements in the major papers all around the world.<BR>
Well, here is the place for you to ask us any questions that<BR>
these Shell-ads raise in your mind.<BR>
<BR>
The Nigerian military dictatorship is also finally waking up to<BR>
the fact that the Ogoni's are able to get their story spread<BR>
across the world. They have placed a number of advertisements in<BR>
the papers to try to counteract the bad publicity which they are<BR>
getting (and deserve). Now is your chance to ask us any questions<BR>
about issues that seem unclear to you.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the loyalty of all Ogoni's to their people is not<BR>
what it should be. There are some people from Ogoni who say that<BR>
Ken was guilty and that he deserved to die. They are trying to<BR>
split the Ogoni people and to make deals with the Nigerian<BR>
dictatorship on behalf of the Ogonis. We wish that life was<BR>
simple but as you know there are always a few rotten apples in<BR>
the basket. In Ken's recently published book (see above) he<BR>
explains the history of this conflict and we refer you to that<BR>
book as a first reference. However, may be you can't get it or<BR>
you still have some questions. Send them in and we will do our<BR>
best to answer them.<BR>

The Ogoni Community Association - United Kingdom was set up in 1993 by Ogoni people living in Britain as an affiliate of the Movement for the survival of Ogoni people.

<p>Its remit is to focus world attention on the plight of the Ogoni people throughout peaceful and non-violent campaigning and to support and promote their emancipation through the Ogoni Bill of Rights adopted by general acclaim of the Ogoni people on the 26th day of August, 1990 at Bori, Rivers State.

<h1 align=center>The Ogoni Foundation</h1>
<h3 align=center>Charity Registration Number: 1050502</h3>
The Ogoni Foundation has been set up to relieve poverty and sickness by appropriate charitable (whether medical rehabilitation, financial or other) assistance in any part of the world and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) by the provision of aid to the needy in Nigeria of persons formerly resident there. It also aims to advance the education of people living in the United Kingdom and Nigeria in the Ogoni languages, traditions and cultures by the provision of a Saturday school.  Finally, it will help to protect and preserve the environment in Africa and other parts of the world by the provision of educational leaflets and projects and by assisting the local conservation projects.

<title>JOINT STATEMENT BY MOSOP AND ITS AFFILIATE BODIES</title>

<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="ogoni_info.html">The Ogoni Community Associaton UK</i></a>
<hr>
<h1 align=center>Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation</h1>


<p align=center>
The following information was received by the UNPO General Secretariat on 
November 22, 1995 from The Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP)

<h3 align=center>JOINT STATEMENT BY MOSOP AND ITS AFFILIATE BODIES
AT KANO, KANO STATE</h3>

<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>
Following the startling murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the spokesman of the Ogoni people and the President of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), by the Abacha Military Junta on Friday, November 10, 1995 at exactly 11.30 a.m., precisely one month after the solidarity celebrations of the 54th birthday of Ken, a summit of MOSOP and all its affiliates was held in Ibadan, Oye State in the night of November 10, 1995, which continued by noon of Saturday, November 11, 1995. The first session of the meeting was presided over by Captain N. Deekor, Acting Secretary of MOSOP, and the concluding session by 
Mr. N. Nwibani, Chairman of the MOSOP Crisis Management Committee.

<p>
Acknowledging that the Ogoni People face very real economic, social and political problems emanating from gross abuses and denials of our indigenous rights, human rights and fundamental freedoms, which bear strong parallels to practices of apartheid policy, a number of positions were carefully considered and viable options were adopted for immediate pursuit and actualisation. Acknowledging that the two presiding members were mandated to endorse the resulting communiqu from the summit and that MOSOP s Acting Secretary would consult with certain Ogoni-elders we therefore release the following statement.

<p>
<b>RESOLUTIONS:</b><br>
<ol><p><li>That MOSOP reformulates alternative strategies in order to respond to the upcoming	challenges.
<p><p><li>That MOSOP s non-violent struggle must be stepped up at all levels and its non-	violent capabilities strengthened.
<p><li>That  the Abacha Military Regime be reminded that the chapter on the execution of 	nine Ogoni activists will not be closed until justice is seen to be done to all those who 	planned it and carried it out. Those executed were:
<p>

	1.	Ken Saro-Wiwa<br>
	2.	Dr. Barinem Kiobel<br>
	3.	Mr. John Kpuinen<br>
	4.	Mr. Baribo Bera<br>
	5.	Mr. Saturday Dobee<br>
	6.	Mr. Felix Nwate<br>
	7.	Mr. Nordu Eawo<br>
	8.	Mr. Paul Levura<br>
	9.	Mr. Daniel Gbokoo<br>

<p>
<p><li>We condemn the fact that certain traditional rulers in Rivers State insisted on the 	killing of Ken Saro-Wiwa during a secret meeting at Elele Army Camp near Port 	Harcourt with Rivers State Security Council headed by Lt. Col. Dauda  Musa Komo.

<p><li>We are saddened but strengthened by the fact that our leaders and brothers paid the 	supreme sacrifice to defend the rights of the minorities in the whole of Africa, 	particularly Nigeria, where our natural resources have become the main weapons for 	perpetuating internal And indigenous colonialism.

<p><li>We consider the entire episode a slap in the face of those who sought to play a 	collaborative role with a military junta.

<p><li>We, the Ogoni people, having been mercilessly oppressed and deliberately provoked, 	do not regret our demand for a decent environment, basic human rights and 	fundamental freedoms,  especially concerning our indigenous rights which we view as 	sacred.

<p><li>We are concerned about these rights; we are anxious about our fundamental freedoms, 	we are troubled by the persistent abuses and denials; we are troubled by the persistent 	abuses and denials; and will 	not therefore give up the struggle, even if that struggle 	be in grave defiance of the Abacha dictatorship and its continuous resistance to 	democratic change.

<p><li>As our preliminary response to the official murders of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight 	others, the following measures are to be pursued by all Ogoni activists with the 	utmost vigour in consistence with internationally accepted human rights standards.
	<p>(a)	Continued non-violent resistance to oppose exploitative economic activities in 		the Ogoni territory.
	<p>(b)	Defence and protection of individual and community land rights of the Ogoni
		people.
	<p>(c)	Total and indefinite isolation of Shell Petroleum Development Company 			Limited.
	<p>(d)	Immediate process of restoring Ogoni environment beginning from January 1st, 		1996, which is hereby set aside for tree planting throughout Ogoniland, 			especially around areas devastated by the ecological war.
		This is to mark the 1996 Ogoni Day, and the third anniversary of the 1993
		International Year for Indigenous Peoples.
	<p>(e)	The naming of all major roads leading into each Ogoni Community after our
		murdered leaders as a mark of honour for the supreme sacrifice paid.
	<p>(f)	The filling of vacant positions in MOSOP and its affiliates created by the
		murders on Friday, November 10, 1995.

<p><li>In the meantime, we make the following demands to the International Community, 	particularly the United Nations: to thoroughly investigate the systematic pattern of 	human rights violations which have been nothing short of genocide against the Ogoni 	people in Nigeria.

<p><li>We further demand comprehensive reparations from the Government of Nigeria and t	he multinational oil companies on account of the destruction of the Ogoni ecosystem 	and the killing of over 2,000 Ogonis since April 1993.

<p><li>In the strongest terms, we appeal for immediate and special protection from the 	International Community, especially the United Nations.
</ol>

<p><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>
We view it as grossly absurd for any person or group of persons in or out of government who may believe that the Ogoni Movement is now dead after the killing by a criminal junta of
Ken Saro-Wiwa, whose virtue has been exalted, both locally and internationally. We insist the Ogoni struggle has been strengthened and renewed by Ken Saro-Wiwa s death.
To say that MOSOP is dead or that it will not gather more momentum, while our rights and freedoms are still being denied, is like predicting that once there is night, darkness will not go away again. This is not the case. We want to re-emphasise what the Nigerian Nation has done to the Ogoni loses claim to independence and to freedom from outside influence. Ogoni therefore needs autonomy.







<p><b>ONCE AGAIN, WE DECLARE THAT:</b><br>
<ul>1.	The Ogoni People have been wronged and therefore unequivocally protest and 	outright condemn the swift murders of Ken Saro-Wiwa, Spokesman of the Ogoni 	People and President of MOSOP, and eight other Ogoni environmentalists by the 	bloodthirsty Abacha regime.	
	
<p>2. 	We consider the execution of the nine Ogoni on Friday November 10, 1995, a 	premeditated murder , planned as a final push to crush the Ogoni and to subject the 	people of the Niger Delta to another decade of darkness.

<p>3. 	We lay the blame on General Sani Abacha whose personal attitude and hatred of 	Ogoni people have exposed his delight in the spilling of blood of innocent and 	unarmed Ogonis ever since he was Secretary of Defence in the illegal interim 	government. 
</ul>

All gatherings, including church services in Ogoniland, have been banned by the Nigerian government. Over 1,000 bibles have been destroyed by soldiers and over 60 Bishops, Pastors and Ministers were arrested on November 29, 1995. They are still being detained in army camps. Furthermore, a great number of teachers were arrested during a PTA meeting, and have been detained for a week.

<h3 align=center>Press Statement  23/11/95</h3>

<h3 align=center>19 MORE OGONIS FOR THE JUSTICE AUTA SPECIAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL</h3>


MOSOP wishes to inform the general public in Nigeria and the international community that charges have now been formalised for the arraignment of nineteen more Ogonis before the so called Ogoni Civil disturbances Special Military Tribunal, in January , 1996.


<p>Names of the detainees are contained in Charge No.OCDT/PH/3/95, dated 18/9/95 and are as follows:


<p align=center><table>
<tr><td>1.   BARITURE BANO LEBEE</td><td>11.   KAGBARA BASSEH</td>
<tr><td>2.   JOHN BANATU</td><td>12.   ADAM KAA</td>
<tr><td>3.   BABINA VIZOR</td><td>13.   SAMPSON NTIGNEE</td>
<tr><td>4.   POBGBARA ZORZOR</td><td>14.   GODWIN GBODOO</td>
<tr><td>5.   FRIDAY GBURUMA</td><td>15.   SAMUEL ASIGHA</td>
<tr><td>6.   YEDAL NAASIKPO</td><td>16.   NWINBARI PAPA</td>
<tr><td>7.   PAUL DEEKOR</td><td>17.   BENJAMIN KABARI</td>
<tr><td>8.   ELIJAH LEKIE BADOM</td><td>( Alias Monday Kabari)</td>
<tr><td>9.   BLESSING ISREAL</td><td>18.   BARIBUMA KUMANWE</td>
<tr><td>10. TAAGALO K. MONSI</td><td>19.   NGBAA BAOVI</td>
</table>


<p>MOSOP wishes to note that although Taagalo Monsi (10), Ngbaa Baovi (19), and Baribuma Kumannwe (18) were arrested in the last week of October and first arraigned in a magistrates court on Friday, October 27, 1995. Again while Michael Dogara was arrested, arraigned and detained with them (27/11/95) he is not on the charge list because they found out he comes from Bodo, the native town of late Chief Edward Kobani.
<p>MOSOP also wishes to draw attention to the fact that Mr. Adam Kaa had actually been in detention in the Bori camp cell since March, 1994 for some other matter before May 21, 1994 suspects were brought in there but was erroneously taken to the SIIB cell where he was surprisingly identified  by Alhaja Kobani during an identification parade there. These errors were pointed out to Major Paul Okuntimo who ignored the plea.
<p>The witch hunting of Saro-Wiwas MOSOP members, youths, chiefs, and elders alike have been intensified in the bid to leave no trace of activism in Ogoni.
<p>MOSOP calls on all men of goodwill at home and abroad to put pressure on government to disband the military tribunal which has now been left in place specifically for Ogonis. You must act to prevent further judicial murders in Ogoni.

<html><head><title>ODI - Briefing Paper 4/94</title></head><body><h3>THREE KEY POLICY AREAS</h3><hr><b>Land</b><br> Both the NP and the ANC recognise the importance of rural development and expanding access to land, but priorities and approaches differ. The ANC argues that a national land reform programme is central to future rural development. In contrast to the NP which places major emphasis on market-based initiatives, the ANC's approach would comprise a redistribution of residential and productive land to those who need it (but cannot afford it), and restitution for those who lost land because of the apartheid laws. All major groupings, including the farmers' union, have now accepted the need for some sort of reform, including restitution, but the precise way forward has not been agreed. <p>Yet the problems of executing a significant land and wider agricultural reform programme are immense, not least because of differing views about the relative importance to be given to this issue. While the rural areas contain some 35% of the population (40% of the black population), the combined effect of decades of neglect of small-scale black agriculture, high differentials between rural and urban incomes and the higher level of urbanisation has been to down-play the importance of rural reform. Equally, studies by the World Bank suggest that a reform programme which transferred 30% of white land to blacks, with the latter providing 20% of the costs from their own resources and borrowing a further 30%, would cost about Rand 13bn (some US$3.5bn) at 1993 prices (a transfer of about 3% of national income), but would only lead to some 600,000 people being resettled.<p>Given the scale and complexity of the problems, it is unlikely that a comprehensive new land and rural development programme will start for some time.<p><b>Industrial and trade reform</b><br> Industrial and international trade reform are closely related policy issues. All sides of the policy debate want to lower rates of external protection, reduce across-the-board subsidies to inefficient industries, and diversify exports. All sides, too, argue that the necessary industrial restructuring needs to be sensitive to potential employment losses. <p>Thereafter, at one extreme, the NEM approach would aim to increase the influence of the market by working to reduce subsidies and trade protectionism as rapidly as possible. It acknowledges that 'temporary adjustment assistance' will be needed 'during the transition' but argues that 'no selective discretion ... should take forms which contradict the basic principles of the general adjustment programme'.<p>In contrast, an ANC/MERG approach would aim to change structures through improving industrial performance and expanding production by deliberate policy. Specific initiatives would include promoting competition both by stimulating small and medium-sized enterprise and by pursuing a vigorous anti-trust policy, consistent with recent reports and recommendations from South Africa's Competition Board. Major emphasis would also be placed on a series of policy measures aimed at raising productivity levels, and at expanding industrial output and exports, boosted initially by direct incentives.<p><b>Mining</b><br>Neither major party questions that the new government should encourage continued expansion of the mining sector, including further foreign investment, and that, as a result, no new mining taxes should be introduced for the foreseeable future. What remains unclear is the extent to which a future ANC-led government would act to take reserves into state ownership and precisely how it would encourage the industry to increase the degree of mineral processing prior to export. The ANC has argued that its wish to pass mineral rights to the state is intended only to bring South Africa in line with public ownership in other countries, while sweeping suggestions to institute a national marketing body to oversee the export of certain specified minerals now appear to have been dropped. <p>In the immediate post-election period, a 'mining forum' is likely to be set up quickly. This would comprise representatives of the new government, the (non-foreign) mining companies and the unions; it would be given the task of first continuing the debate, and then thrashing out the details of a new mining policy for the country. <hr>Briefing Papers present objective information on important development issues.

<Title>Kirkstall Valley campaign Letter</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGColor="#FFFFFF" Text="#000000" Link="#0000FF" VLink="#FF00FF" ALink="#FF0000">


<H3>This is the letter included in an email to us from Kirkstall Valley Campaign Group
</H3>

<pre>

In the light of the media interest in allegations of parliamentary
sleaze, I would like to draw your attention to the controversy
surrounding a major development in Kirkstall, Leeds.  Although of
particular concern to local residents, it is of National significance in
that it draws attention to the failure of  existing regulatory bodies to
protect the public interest.  It is a glaring example of how vested
interests and secrecy can destroy a neighbourhood, and how the
Government can suppress the truth.  Certainly, if you are genuinely
interested in sleaze, corruption, maladministration and incompetence,
and more importantly how these can combine to override the public
interest you could do much worse than look at this case.  You will find
that criticism should be levelled at the behaviours of the DoE, the
Treasury solicitors, the officers of the local Council and most
significantly the operation of a former quango, the Leeds Development
Corporation (LDC).

The controversy surrounds the grant of planning permission for a huge
supermarket on playing fields in a highly dense residential area of
Leeds.  The main beneficiaries of this are the local RUFC, several
directors of which were involved on the planning authority (the LDC). 
In addition, the actions of the Chair of the planning authority must be
suspect since most of the decisions leading to this consent were taken
when he had a substantial pecuniary interest (estimated to be 20
million).

A cursory look at the scheme shows that it has been rushed through
without consideration of the highways problems.  The site is situated on
the second busiest road into Leeds and conservative estimates suggest
that the development will lead to a 25% increase in traffic volumes. 
The local population have been denied crossing facilities in the
existing scheme on the grounds that there are too many pedestrians. 
Now, under pressure to push the scheme through, the Highways officers
have failed to consider the interests of Public transport, cyclists and,
most importantly, pedestrians.
This scheme has not yet passed all the obstacles but the Government is
exerting pressure on the Council to push it through.  A little bit of
investigative journalism would certainly give Ministers and the Council
something to think about and, maybe, prevent the accumulated effects of
bias, maladministration and protection of self interest from ruining an
inner city community.

Some key facts, for which there is documentary and legal evidence,
follow:-

  1) Appointment of a major political activist for the Conservative
Party to the Chair of the Leeds Development Corporation (LDC) by the
DoE.  This quango was the planning authority for an area in Kirkstall,
Leeds.

  2) The failure by the aforementioned appointee to declare both a
substantial pecuniary interest (up to 20 million) in connection with a
planning application in Kirkstall, and his connections with the
Developer.

  3) The grant of planning permission by the LDC to this Developer for a
very large supermarket on playing fields in a high density residential
area without consideration of the full traffic and environmental
effects, not to mention the detrimental effect on the local population.

  4) The destruction of evidence (the controversial planning file) by
the LDC at the end of its operational life.  All other planning files
were handed to the Council.

  5) The failure of the DoE to investigate the actions of its
appointees.  Instead it sought to subvert the public interest and defend
the actions of the LDC.

  6) The failure of the Treasury solicitors, acting for the DoE, to
disclose material facts in court.  They knew the planning file had been
destroyed yet stated that it had been handed to Leeds City Council after
the demise of the LDC.

  7) The behaviour of Council officers in the Highways department who
have failed to consider properly the safety and interests of
pedestrians.


Most of the information proving the above statements has already been
collated and all you would need to do is to ask certain Ministers and
local Councillors what threats are being used to push the scheme
through.  This is a case where your questions and reporting of the truth
could prevent a major miscarriage of justice.  I will gladly provide you
with a fuller account of the events surrounding this case and back them
up with  documentary evidence.
I look forward to hearing from you.

VSO has programmes in countries including Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Namibia, Nigeria, Uganda, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Belize, Sri Lanka, and in Eastern Europe.<p>

<b>Michael Craven is a Physiotherapist at the Cambodia Trust's Limb Fitting Centre in Kompong Som, Cambodia</b><p>

Each day Michael Craven is faced with the consequences of the 'killing fields' of Cambodia. There are an estimated 7 million landmines in Cambodia and injuries from land mine explosions result in 250 amputations every month. Michael Craven works with rural communities, fitting landmine victims with artificial limbs so that they can generate income by returning to farm their land.<p>

The aim is to get these people back to work so their families don't suffer.  Treatment at the Cambodia Trust's Limb Fitting Centre gives them a chance to earn a living for their families and lead normal, active lives.<p>

An important part of Michael Craven's work is setting up an outreach programme for the centre and training local outreach workers to run the programme. Persuading patients fitted with artificial limbs to return for regular 6-monthly checks is difficult, and the outreach programme encourages these checks.  It particularly targets women and children who, finding it more difficult to visit the town clinic, often remain untreated in their villages.<p>

<b>Catherine Lillington is an English Teacher working at the Khemera Project in Cambodia.</b><p>

Khemera helps Cambodian women to take responsibility for their future. Members of this women's group work together to realise their potential and play a full role in national development.  Established four years ago, Khemera is developing a credit programme, setting up child-care centres and training village women in leadership skills.<p>

For the Khmer-speaking women of Khemera, Cambodia's first local non-governmental organisation, learning English is about empowerment. Catherine Lillington's lessons allows access to local training courses and enables them to communicate with potential funders. <p>

Command of English enables the women to lobby for political advantage and financial support, and the work of VSO volunteers has allowed the group's Deputy-Director to represent and talk about Khemera's work overseas. This will allow Khemera, in collaboration with other NGOs, to play a strong role in advocating protection of human rights and promotion of democracy in Cambodia. <p> 

<b>Matthew Agnew is a carpentry instructor at Mai Habar Vocational Training Centre in Eritrea</b><p>

After a devastating 30-year civil war, the people of Eritrea are determined to regenerate their country.  But for whole generations of Eritreans the only formal education was being taught how to fight.  Now there is a strong government commitment to regain lost technical skills.<p>

Mai Habar, an old army base, has been turned into a training college for disabled ex-fighters, and VSO technical instructors like Matthew are helping them become economically active and independent.  The college also aims to recruit other disadvantaged groups, including war widows and former refugees returning from neighbouring Ethiopia.<p>

<b>Monica Golding is a Mini-league sports coach in South Africa</b><p>

Sports development is an exciting new initiative for VSO, and Monica is the second of six sports volunteers to be posted to South Africa this year.  Mini-League is a team ballsport similar to mini-rugby which has been specially adapted to township life, and Monica coaches children aged 5-13 in Alexandra, a township outside Johannesburg.  <p>

The game can be played with teams of different sizes, abilities and ages, and the need for space and equipment is minimal.  The aim of the scheme is to give more people in the townships access to sports facilities, offering a sense of direction and commmitment to young people in the poorest parts of the country.<p><hr><p>

<b>1. The Reflect Mother Manual</b><br>
David Archer & Sara Cottingham 1996.
<p>

The Reflect Mother Manual is a detailed and practical guide to a new approach to adult literacy which 
radically re-defines the role of adult literacy in social change. In a Reflect programme there is no
textbook or primer, only a facilitator's manual. Each literacy circle develops its own  learning
materials though the construction of maps, matrices, calendars and diagrams. The Mother Manual is
primarily aimed at education co-ordinators and advisors in grassroots organisations, NGOs, national,
regional and local governments who are planning a literacy programme. It will also be of interest to
a wider group of development practitioners, policy makers donors and academics.

<b>2. Listening to Smaller Voices</b><p>


This report, based on significant research into the roles of children in developing countries,
concludes that children make a substantial contribution to the workloads of households - in the home
itself, in the field and through remittances for wage labour. Instead of being "seen and not heard",
children should be brought into the process of development planning, implementation and evaluation.

<H3>Scientific and technological cooperation between the European
Community and Latin America</h3>
<P>
The present article regarding scientific and technological cooperation
between the European Community and Latin America can be placed
in the context of the development aid and cooperation offered
by the European Union in the framework of its foreign policy with
the Latin American region. The main aim here consists in analyzing
those cooperation programmes established by the European Community
with the developing countries of Latin America regarding science
and technology, with the goal of identifying, both on the European
Union as well as on the Latin American side, the mechanisms established
for putting this into practice as well as the perspectives for
success which these can generate in the framework of regional
cooperation.

<hr>
<a name=ant></a><h3>Antecedentes</h3> </P>
<P>
El progreso de los Pa&iacute;ses en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo
(PVD) estaba relacionado inicialmente , directamente, con la pol&iacute;tica
metr&oacute;poli-colonial ejercida por las grandes potencias de
la &eacute;poca <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Con el final del colonialismo y a partir
de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, nace la voluntad por parte de todos
los pa&iacute;ses del establecimiento de nuevas Relaciones Internacionales,
con el objeto de lograr su bienestar social, pol&iacute;tico y
comercial, mediante el fortalecimiento de la paz y del desarrollo
econ&oacute;mico. </P>
<P>
Con el nacimiento de las organizaciones internacionales, el fortalecimiento
de &oacute;rganos regionales y el aumento de las demandas por
parte de los PVD de una participaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s igualitaria
en el comercio mundial, a fin de alcanzar su esperado desarrollo
econ&oacute;mico y social, toma cuerpo la idea de la cooperaci&oacute;n
internacional <a href="#2">(2)</a>. </P>
<P>
El principio de igualdad en la v&iacute;a econ&oacute;mica internacional
conlleva un concepto diferente de Estado que, al rev&eacute;s
del concepto cl&aacute;sico del Derecho Internacional, el cual
determina un mismo estatus jur&iacute;dico a los Estados soberanos,
se fundamenta en base a un concepto singular, donde cada Estado
est&aacute; sometido a un r&eacute;gimen jur&iacute;dico propio
en raz&oacute;n de su grado de desarrollo <a href="#3">(3)</a>. Este car&aacute;cter
jur&iacute;dico diferenciado, posibilita que los pa&iacute;ses
menos desarrollados se beneficien de ventajas especiales y diferenciadas
en relaci&oacute;n a los industrializados, fruto del principio
de solidaridad que, junto al de igualdad ya mencionado y al de
soberan&iacute;a, constituyen los fundamentos base del derecho
al desarrollo; entendido como el conjunto de reglas jur&iacute;dicas
establecidas en favor de los PVD, destinadas a que estos accedan
a determinadas oportunidades espec&iacute;ficas, con el objeto
de promover su progreso y posibilitar una actuaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s
igualitaria en el comercio internacional, fortaleciendo su presencia
en la sociedad internacional. </P>
<P>
En el dominio del desarrollo, existen dos formas para evidenciar
la colaboraci&oacute;n entre Estados, una mediante la ayuda y
asistencia internacional y otra por la v&iacute;a de la cooperaci&oacute;n
internacional <a href="#4">(4)</a>. El criterio jur&iacute;dico-econ&oacute;mico
que permite calificar tales operaciones como de ayuda, est&aacute;
en las condiciones m&aacute;s favorables existentes, con relaci&oacute;n
a las que se exigen para las mismas actividades a otros sujetos.
</P>
<P>
Los t&eacute;rminos ayuda y asistencia est&aacute;n siendo paulatinamente
sustituidos por el de cooperaci&oacute;n, en base a dos razones
principales: de un lado, porque la cooperaci&oacute;n, entendida
en sentido estricto como la puesta en com&uacute;n de recursos
destinados a la realizaci&oacute;n de un objetivo predeterminado
por las partes en relaci&oacute;n de igualdad entre s&iacute;,
supone una mayor reciprocidad, en la medida que existe una colaboraci&oacute;n
mutua de medios, riesgos y beneficios. Cambia, pues, el matiz
de la operaci&oacute;n, a trav&eacute;s de la donaci&oacute;n
se comparten conocimiento, activos, t&eacute;cnicas, riesgos y
beneficios. Hecho que, de cierta forma, promueve la soberan&iacute;a
e independencia de los PVD frente a los pa&iacute;ses industrializados
(PI). De otro lado, puede entenderse que la asistencia o ayuda
sean partes de una obra com&uacute;n: la cooperaci&oacute;n, teniendo
estas dos operaciones car&aacute;cter transitorio <a href="#5">(5)</a>. </P>
<P>
En la actualidad, entretanto, y en vista al contenido fundamental
de las operaciones de cooperaci&oacute;n entre pa&iacute;ses industrializados
y PVD, el t&eacute;rmino cooperaci&oacute;n no se diferencia en
el fondo del de ayuda otorgada a pa&iacute;ses menos desarrollados,
manteniendo la interdependencia de los pa&iacute;ses perif&eacute;ricos
frente a los centrales. </P>
<P>
<a name=coo></a><h3>La cooperaci&#243;n cient&#237;fica y tecnol&#243;gica</h3>
</P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n internacional comprende innumerables operaciones,
situadas a su vez en varios sectores econ&oacute;micos. Sus formas
o modalidades pueden ser did&aacute;cticamente clasificadas mediante
tres criterios diferenciadores <a href="#6">(6)</a>: el primero, con respecto al
origen de la ayuda o aportaci&oacute;n; seg&uacute;n este criterio,
la cooperaci&oacute;n puede tener car&aacute;cter p&uacute;blico,
concesional o no concesional, o un car&aacute;cter privado, que
consiste en aportaciones del sector privado a la cooperaci&oacute;n.
Un segundo criterio dispone sobre las modalidades de la cooperaci&oacute;n,
o sea, si son realizadas bilateral o multilateralmente. En efecto,
estas dos formas son usadas conjuntamente; la primera se puede
entender como aquella realizada mediante la intervenci&oacute;n
del Gobierno u organismo privado de un pa&iacute;s y de un Gobierno
u organismos de un PVD. Ser&iacute;a esta modalidad, seg&uacute;n
el profesor Michel B&eacute;langer <a href="#7">(7)</a>, la forma m&aacute;s tradicional
de cooperaci&oacute;n, remont&aacute;ndose sus or&iacute;genes
a la era colonial. El inconveniente de este tipo de colaboraci&oacute;n,
desde la &oacute;ptica de los PVD, es que puede llegar a traducirse
en pretensiones imperialistas y de expansi&oacute;n comercial
por parte de los PI; de otro lado &eacute;sta puede, a la inversa,
representar una respuesta m&aacute;s pragm&aacute;tica a carencias
concretas de los PVD <a href="#8">(8)</a>. </P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n multilateral se sit&uacute;a en el cuadro
de las organizaciones internacionales y se caracteriza por efectuar
aportaciones concebidas a trav&eacute;s de la contribuci&oacute;n
de sus Estados miembros, generalmente pa&iacute;ses industrializados,
en favor de los PVD. </P>
<P>
El &uacute;ltimo criterio diferenciador es el relativo a los objetos
sujetos a la cooperaci&oacute;n. La cooperaci&oacute;n puede revestir
una gama de modalidades seg&uacute;n el objeto de transferencia
de la operaci&oacute;n; aunque la multiplicidad de prestaciones
destinadas a los PVD se reducen a dos categor&iacute;as <a href="#9">(9)</a>: la
transmisi&oacute;n de conocimientos y la aportaci&oacute;n de
capital. Esta &uacute;ltima se estructura a trav&eacute;s de las
contribuciones realizadas mediante las donaciones de los organismos
internacionales y regionales, las ayudas realizadas por los propios
Estados bilateralmente y las aportaciones del sector privado.
La transmisi&oacute;n de conocimientos, a su vez, se concreta
mediante la asistencia t&eacute;cnica y la transferencia de tecnolog&iacute;a,
objetivos de fondo de las pol&iacute;ticas de cooperaci&oacute;n
en ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a. </P>
<P>
Es una condici&oacute;n para el desarrollo el acceso al progreso
t&eacute;cnico; por tanto hace falta, de un lado, capital humano
cualificado y capacitado para asimilar las nuevas innovaciones
tecnol&oacute;gicas emergentes y, de otro, la posibilidad de vivenciar
tales innovaciones. </P>
<P>
El profesor Papanicolaou <a href="#10">(10)</a> expone que los retrasos en la puesta
en marcha de grandes proyectos de inversi&oacute;n son debidos,
de un lado, a la falta de planes micro y macro econ&oacute;micos
bien elaborados para su consecuci&oacute;n y, de otro, al bajo
nivel del personal en asimilar tal operaci&oacute;n. Siguiendo
su argumentaci&oacute;n, se concluye que estos dos factores tienen
en com&uacute;n el elemento humano y que es la formaci&oacute;n,
en realidad, le principal goulot d&#180;etranglement du d&eacute;velopment
&eacute;conomique. </P>
<P>
Desde finales de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la cooperaci&oacute;n
t&eacute;cnica se ha transformado en un rasgo permanente de las
relaciones econ&oacute;micas internacionales Norte-Sur. Inicialmente
esta cooperaci&oacute;n fue utilizada como el &uacute;nico medio
de la transmisi&oacute;n de conocimientos de los PI a los PVD
<a href="#11">(11)</a>. </P>
<P>
Esta clase de colaboraci&oacute;n tiene dos rasgos primordiales:
de un lado, sirve como instrumento de aceleraci&oacute;n en la
formaci&oacute;n de t&eacute;cnicos, cuadros directivos y administradores
de los PVD mediante la transmisi&oacute;n de experiencias o consejos
elaborados por expertos de los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s avanzados,
y est&aacute; caracterizada como asistencia t&eacute;cnica de
los pa&iacute;ses industrializados a los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo.
Esta asistencia o ayuda se realiza generalmente por medio de la
concesi&oacute;n de becas a los investigadores de los PVD para
su formaci&oacute;n, y/o a trav&eacute;s de suministros de personal
humano y equipo necesario para la realizaci&oacute;n de un proyecto
conjunto de investigaci&oacute;n y desarrollo. Las participaciones
referidas, en el supuesto de la cooperaci&oacute;n multilateral,
se efect&uacute;an mediante programas generales de ayuda o asistencia
t&eacute;cnica y cient&iacute;fica, gestionados por organismos
internacionales o regionales, los cuales pueden tener car&aacute;cter
general <a href="#12">(12)</a> o espec&iacute;fico en determinados pa&iacute;ses
o grupos de pa&iacute;ses <a href="#13">(13)</a>. </P>
<P>
De otro lado, y dado que es cada vez m&aacute;s generalizado el
convencimiento que el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico depende sobre
todo de la materia gris, entendida en su triple acepci&oacute;n
de creaci&oacute;n/descubrimiento de medios y productos, innovaci&oacute;n
o aplicaci&oacute;n de lo creado con fines de inversi&oacute;n
y consumo y de organizaci&oacute;n de tareas <a href="#14">(14)</a>; y la manifiesta
desigualdad que origina el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico de un pa&iacute;s
con respecto a otro, queda patente en la necesidad por parte de
los pa&iacute;ses menos desarrollados de acceder e importar los
conocimientos mencionados o, en otras palabras, de acceder a la
transferencia tecnol&oacute;gica. </P>
<P>
La mejora de sus bases tecnol&oacute;gicas y la importaci&oacute;n
de los insumos indispensables para el restablecimiento, mantenimiento
y ampliaci&oacute;n de la capacidad de producci&oacute;n, a fin
de hacer frente a los desaf&iacute;os del crecimiento y a los
cambios estructurales imprescindibles para una mejor participaci&oacute;n
en la econom&iacute;a internacional, motivan a los PVD a movilizar
recursos tecnol&oacute;gicos exteriores y a activar canales, mecanismos,
corrientes e instrumentos para la transferencia tecnol&oacute;gica.
A partir de esta perspectiva, la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
y t&eacute;cnica entre los PI y los PVD debe, adem&aacute;s, de
contribuir a la capacitaci&oacute;n y formaci&oacute;n de capital
humano de estos &uacute;ltimos, servir como mecanismo de transferencia
de conocimientos y t&eacute;cnicas que supongan un mayor enlace
de los PVD en la econom&iacute;a internacional y contribuya a
la mejora de las Relaciones Internacionales Norte-Sur. </P>
<P>
Los objetivos del presente trabajo ser&aacute;n analizar la cooperaci&oacute;n
entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y los PVD de Am&eacute;rica Latina
en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, para lo cual debemos
identificar de un lado los mecanismos de &eacute;sta y, de otro,
sus perspectivas. </P>
<P>

<P>
<B>Aproximaci&oacute;n en las Relaciones Comunidad Europea y Am&eacute;rica
Latina</B> </P>
<P>
La pol&iacute;tica comunitaria de cooperaci&oacute;n o de desarrollo
naci&oacute; por incidente, o incluso por accidente <a href="#15">(15)</a>, dentro
de las negociaciones del Tratado de Roma en 1957, cuando Francia
impuls&oacute; la asociaci&oacute;n a la Comunidad de sus colonias.
A esta propuesta se adher&iacute;an B&eacute;lgica, Italia y Pa&iacute;ses
Bajos. Con la independencia de estos territorios se establecen
unas nuevas relaciones de colaboraci&oacute;n fundadas sobre el
principio de soberan&iacute;a de las nuevas naciones. A partir
de la ampliaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad, con la incorporaci&oacute;n
del Reino Unido, Irlanda y Dinamarca y, por consiguiente, de los
territorios de la Commonwealth a la asociaci&oacute;n, se promueven
privilegiadas relaciones con los pa&iacute;ses asociados, principalmente
con la firma de la Convenci&oacute;n de Lom&eacute; <a href="#16">(16)</a> y con
el inicio de una pol&iacute;tica europea en el Mediterr&aacute;neo
<a href="#17">(17)</a>. </P>
<P>
Los mencionados lazos eclipsaron los intereses de la cooperaci&oacute;n
comunitaria hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina, cuyo trato se ha desarrollado
en el &aacute;mbito de las relaciones de los pa&iacute;ses no
alineados o no asociados <a href="#18">(18)</a>, y mediante etapas progresivas.
Concretamente en la d&eacute;cada de los ochenta, coincidiendo
con el Tercer Decenio del Desarrollo, decretado por las Naciones
Unidas para el per&iacute;odo 1981-1990, es cuando se polariza
la idea de un Nuevo Orden Econ&oacute;mico Internacional por parte
de los pa&iacute;ses pobres, representando para las relaciones
entre las dos regiones un cambio de postura en pro al acercamiento.
</P>
<P>
Desde 1972 el Consejo Europeo proclama la necesidad de la realizaci&oacute;n
de una pol&iacute;tica global de cooperaci&oacute;n, que debe
ser efectuada por medio de las orientaciones e instrumentos desarrollados
por la Comisi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
El Comunicado de la Comisi&oacute;n al Consejo en 1984, sobre
Las orientaciones para el fortalecimiento de las relaciones entre
la Comunidad y Am&eacute;rica Latina <a href="#19">(19)</a>, representa la primera
ocasi&oacute;n en que se elaboran por parte de la Comunidad unas
directrices para el fortalecimiento de la cooperaci&oacute;n multilateral
entre ambas regiones. </P>
<P>
Teniendo en cuenta la carencia de inter&eacute;s de la pol&iacute;tica
exterior de la Comunidad hacia Latinoam&eacute;rica, adem&aacute;s
del fr&aacute;gil di&aacute;logo, hasta entonces existente entre
las dos &aacute;reas, estas orientaciones no han conducido a un
cambio significativo en la mencionada relaci&oacute;n. La necesidad
y voluntad de una mejora cualitativa y cuantitativa de &eacute;sta,
vino a ra&iacute;z de numerosos factores de significativa importancia.
Desde el prisma de Am&eacute;rica Latina, cabr&iacute;a destacar,
de un lado, la democratizaci&oacute;n de sus Estados, todav&iacute;a
no consolidada en raz&oacute;n de la continua crisis social y
econ&oacute;mica que viven muchos de &eacute;stos y que impide
y/o distorsiona el edificio institucional de la democracia representativa.
De otro lado, la implementaci&oacute;n de programas de ajustes
macroecon&oacute;micos y el cambio en el modelo vigente de sustituci&oacute;n
de las importaciones, han permitido la modificaci&oacute;n substancial
en sus pol&iacute;ticas exteriores, traduci&eacute;ndose en la
voluntad de diversificar &eacute;stas, por medio de la integraci&oacute;n
de sus econom&iacute;as en el orden econ&oacute;mico internacional
actual. </P>
<P>
Con respecto a la Comunidad, la adhesi&oacute;n de Portugal y
Espa&ntilde;a, pa&iacute;ses con tradicionales lazos de amistad
y una historia com&uacute;n con Latinoam&eacute;rica, y el aumento
de la competencia en materia de pol&iacute;tica exterior, a ra&iacute;z
del Tratado de Maastricht, signific&oacute; la revitalizaci&oacute;n
del inter&eacute;s comunitario hacia esta regi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
Igualmente, se estableci&oacute; un di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico
y comercial fluido entre ambas regiones, iniciado a partir de
una conferencia, realizada al margen de la reuni&oacute;n del
27 de septiembre de 1987 de la Asamblea General de las Naciones
Unidas en Nueva York, entre la Comunidad Europea y los pa&iacute;ses
pertenecientes al Grupo de R&iacute;o, bloque surgido por la fusi&oacute;n
de dos grupos de pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos: el grupo Contadora
(Colombia, M&eacute;xico, Panam&aacute; y Venezuela) y el grupo
de Apoyo (Argentina, Brasil, Per&uacute; y Uruguay); en 1988 Panam&aacute;
fue apartado de &eacute;stos y en 1990 ingresan en &eacute;l:
Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador y Paraguay. En la actualidad forman el
grupo de once pa&iacute;ses que, a su vez, coinciden con los miembros
de la Asociaci&oacute;n Latinoamericana de Integraci&oacute;n
(ALADI). </P>
<P>
Este di&aacute;logo se institucionaliza el 20 de diciembre de
1990 en la Conferencia informal de Roma, mediante la aprobaci&oacute;n
de las partes de la realizaci&oacute;n anual de Conferencias Ministeriales
entre las dos regiones, representando el marco institucional de
las relaciones latinoamericanas y comunitarias. </P>
<P>
Como resultado inmediato a esta nueva fase de relaciones destaca,
en lo institucional, adem&aacute;s del desarrollo de un foro pol&iacute;tico
entre la Comunidad y el Grupo de R&iacute;o, un aumento de la
posici&oacute;n de la CE en Am&eacute;rica Latina, con las nuevas
aperturas de embajadas o delegaciones de la Comisi&oacute;n en
las capitales latinoamericanas <a href="#20">(20)</a>. En lo comercial, la aplicaci&oacute;n
anticipada de la Oferta de Montreal, dentro de la Ronda de Uruguay,
permite una mejora en las condiciones de acceso al mercado comunitario
de productos latinoamericanos. Y finalmente, en lo que respecta
a la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica entre las dos regiones
se han incrementado por parte de la CE instrumentos y mecanismos
de incentivo a la inversi&oacute;n comunitaria hacia Am&eacute;rica
Latina, adem&aacute;s de la posibilidad por parte del Banco Europeo
de Inversiones (BEI), de invertir en proyectos de inversi&oacute;n
en Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia. </P>
<P>
En el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica y
cient&iacute;fica interregional, a ra&iacute;z de la institucionalizaci&oacute;n
de un di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico y con la finalidad de evitar
el aislamiento de cient&iacute;ficos de ambas regiones, promoviendo
a largo plazo el mercado com&uacute;n del conocimiento; tanto
la CE como Am&eacute;rica Latina han elaborado programas y/o instrumentos
que albergan capital humano de ambas regiones, en el &aacute;rea
de la investigaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y tecnol&oacute;gica.
El descubrimiento y el an&aacute;lisis de estos mecanismos de
cooperaci&oacute;n es la tarea del presente trabajo, para lo cual,
se intentar&aacute;n describir los instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n
de la CE hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina y los programas latinoamericanos
de participaci&oacute;n europea y extranjera. </P>
<P>
<B>Mecanismos e instrumentos de la Cooperaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad
Europea y Am&eacute;rica Latina</B> </P>
<P>
A efectos de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo con los pa&iacute;ses
en v&iacute;as de desarrollo de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina,
la Comunidad dispone actualmente de los instrumentos siguientes:
</P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica, cuyo
objetivo es facilitar a los PVD los resultados de la investigaci&oacute;n
europea, y tambi&eacute;n abrir &eacute;sta a los problemas espec&iacute;ficos
del Tercer Mundo <a href="#21">(21)</a>. </P>
<P>
La pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica
de la CE con los PVD no asociados se realiza en el contexto de
programas globales, enfocados a su aprovechamiento por los PVD
m&aacute;s avanzados <a href="#22">(22)</a>. Se realizan mediante la financiaci&oacute;n
de proyectos conjuntos de investigaci&oacute;n, as&iacute; como
creaci&oacute;n de bolsas de estudios, financiaci&oacute;n de
work shops cient&iacute;ficos, talleres, etc. </P>
<P>
La Comunidad ha utilizado algunos instrumentos para acrecentar
y llevar a cabo el desarrollo de su cooperaci&oacute;n internacional
en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a; tradicionalmente dos
ser&iacute;an los principales: el SDT- Programa de Ciencia y T&eacute;cnica
al servicio del Desarrollo- y el ISC -Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica
Internacional <a href="#23">(23)</a>. A ra&iacute;z del di&aacute;logo entre el
Grupo de R&iacute;o y la CE, se posibilita la participaci&oacute;n
de organismos latinoamericanos en los programas macro de investigaci&oacute;n
y desarrollo de la Comunidad. </P>
<P>
Finalmente, en el &aacute;mbito de la pol&iacute;tica Europea
de cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo, dest&aacute;case el programa
COLUMBUS, creado en 1987 por la Comisi&oacute;n de los Rectores
Europeos (CRE), representando el principal mecanismo de asistencia
internacional en lo que respecta a la formaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
y a la movilidad interuniversitaria. </P>
<P>
<B>STD-Ciencia y T&eacute;cnica al servicio del Desarrollo</B>
</P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica de la Comunidad con Am&eacute;rica
Latina se basa principalmente en el intercambio de conocimientos
cient&iacute;ficos pre-competitivos o sea, aquellos que no est&aacute;n
en relaci&oacute;n directa con el perfeccionamiento de un producto
que est&aacute; en un mercado. Es una investigaci&oacute;n, por
lo tanto, que no va dirigida a mejorar la productividad espec&iacute;fica
de un pa&iacute;s o un producto. </P>
<P>
El primer instrumento de la cooperaci&oacute;n europea en materia
de ciencia y t&eacute;cnica que afect&oacute; Am&eacute;rica Latina
fue el denominado STD-Ciencia y T&eacute;cnica al Servicio del
Desarrollo, creado en 1987, el cual comprende tres per&iacute;odos
de realizaci&oacute;n de cuatro a&ntilde;os: el STD1 (1983-1986),
el STD2 (1987-1991) y, finalmente, el STD3 (1990-1994) <a href="#24">(24)</a>. </P>
<P>
Este programa se incluye en el Programa Marco de la Comunidad
en materia de investigaci&oacute;n y desarrollo <a href="#25">(25)</a>, sus objetivos
globales ser&iacute;an: el fomento de una mayor y mejor coordinaci&oacute;n
en el &aacute;mbito europeo del desarrollo de la cooperaci&oacute;n
cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica entre los pa&iacute;ses en
v&iacute;as de desarrollo <a href="#26">(26)</a>, el incentivo al fortalecimiento
de la capacidad en materia cient&iacute;fica de los PVD, la reestructuraci&oacute;n
del modelo actual de Relaciones Internacionales en dominio cient&iacute;fico
y t&eacute;cnico, y la ayuda a la creaci&oacute;n y desarrollo
de c&eacute;lulas de investigaci&oacute;n en el Tercer Mundo.
</P>
<P>
El &aacute;mbito de aplicaci&oacute;n de este instrumento est&aacute;
en la investigaci&oacute;n en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a
de los seres vivos, dando prioridad los temas relativos a la agricultura,
nutrici&oacute;n, medicina y medio ambiente. Esta investigaci&oacute;n
tiene a su vez dos &aacute;reas de actuaci&oacute;n, la agricultura
y la medicina <a href="#27">(27)</a>, distribuidas en la mejora del nivel de vida,
con &eacute;nfasis en la investigaci&oacute;n de m&eacute;todos
duraderos de producci&oacute;n agr&iacute;cola, vegetal y animal
logrando la reducci&oacute;n del d&eacute;ficit alimentario de
algunos PVD, y mejorando cualitativamente la participaci&oacute;n
de los referidos pa&iacute;ses en los intercambios internacionales.
Investigaciones que fomenten el desarrollo de las producciones
agr&iacute;colas de alto valor econ&oacute;mico, por medio del
estudio de sistemas de producci&oacute;n y marketing de los cultivos
de renta. Mecanismos para el aumento cuantitativo y cualitativo
de las producciones para la satisfacci&oacute;n de las normas
del comercio internacional y la mejora de los valores de mercado
de los productos producidos, as&iacute; como el estudio sobre
las posibilidades de transformaci&oacute;n in situ de esos productos,
con &eacute;nfasis en la protecci&oacute;n medio ambiental. </P>
<P>
Otra &aacute;rea es la relativa a la mejora del estado de salud;
los objetivos aqu&iacute; ser&iacute;an, de un lado, investigaciones
sobre la prevenci&oacute;n y tratamiento de enfermedades predominantes
en los PVD, con &eacute;nfasis en las enfermedades tropicales
(transmisivas o no) y enfermedades de transmisi&oacute;n sexual
(especialmente el SIDA), y de otro lado, la ayuda en la creaci&oacute;n
u organizaci&oacute;n de sistemas de asistencia sanitaria adaptados
al medio rural o urbano de los PVD. </P>
<P>
El importe estimado necesario para la ejecuci&oacute;n del programa
STD es de 109,89 millones de Ecus, de los que 71,43 millones est&aacute;n
destinados al &aacute;rea de la agricultura y 38,46 a la de medicina,
sanidad y nutrici&oacute;n. Este desglose no excluye la posibilidad
de que determinados proyectos afecten de forma simult&aacute;nea
a ambas &aacute;reas <a href="#28">(28)</a>. </P>
<P>
Las modalidades de realizaci&oacute;n de este programa se concretan
en las siguientes: </P>
<P>
-Proyectos conjuntos de investigaci&oacute;n, entre al menos un
socio establecido en la Comunidad (Universidad, organismos de
investigaci&oacute;n, empresas...). Los acuerdos ser&aacute;n
objeto de contratos de Investigaci&oacute;n y Desarrollo (I+D)
celebrados mediante un procedimiento de selecci&oacute;n, basado
en convocatorias de propuestas publicadas en el Diario Oficial
de las Comunidades Europeas (DOCE). Los costes son compartidos,
la Comunidad no puede participar financieramente con un porcentaje
superior al 50% del total de la acci&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
-Medidas complementarias destinadas a la organizaci&oacute;n de
seminarios, talleres y conferencias cient&iacute;ficas, actividades
de formaci&oacute;n de vanguardia y de fomento de la explotaci&oacute;n
de los resultados de las investigaciones realizadas. </P>
<P>
-Acciones concertadas, consisten en el esfuerzo de la Comunidad
para coordinar la investigaci&oacute;n que se realice por sus
Estados miembros. </P>
<P>
<B>Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica Internacional: El programa
ALAMED</B> </P>
<P>
El programa ALAMED (Programa de Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica
y T&eacute;cnica entre la Comunidad Europea y pa&iacute;ses de
Am&eacute;rica Latina, Asia y Mediterr&aacute;neo) es una cooperaci&oacute;n
complementaria al programa anteriormente analizado y est&aacute;
integrado en el programa de cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
internacional de la CE, creado en 1984, del cual s&oacute;lo se
pueden beneficiar los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo con los que
la Comunidad mantiene un acuerdo de cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral
<a href="#29">(29)</a>. </P>
<P>
Este programa pretende facilitar la movilidad entre los cient&iacute;ficos
comunitarios y los de las regiones citadas, estableciendo relaciones
fluidas y permanentes entre Europa y los dem&aacute;s pa&iacute;ses.
</P>
<P>
Los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina participantes son los
siguientes: Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, M&eacute;xico,
Nicaragua, Panam&aacute;, Per&uacute;, Uruguay y Venezuela <a href="#30">(30)</a>.
</P>
<P>
En contrapartida al programa SDT, los campos de investigaci&oacute;n
del ISC abarcan una amplia gama de disciplinas como f&iacute;sica,
matem&aacute;ticas e ingenier&iacute;a, materiales, qu&iacute;mica,
medio ambiente, ciencias de la tierra, salud y biomedicina, biolog&iacute;a
y agricultura <a href="#31">(31)</a>. Cada pa&iacute;s tiene predefinidas las &aacute;reas
de actuaci&oacute;n de este programa, por acuerdos mutuos entre
la CE y las autoridades nacionales. </P>
<P>
La colaboraci&oacute;n se canaliza principalmente mediante la
elaboraci&oacute;n de proyectos conjuntos de investigaci&oacute;n,
de dos a tres a&ntilde;os de duraci&oacute;n, financiados por
la Comunidad a trav&eacute;s de una contribuci&oacute;n m&aacute;xima
de 350.000 Ecus. Tambi&eacute;n por la concesi&oacute;n de becas
de estancias en laboratorios cient&iacute;ficos de Estados miembros
comunitarios, con una duraci&oacute;n m&aacute;xima de 24 meses,
asignadas a investigadores doctorados empleados en una instituci&oacute;n
cient&iacute;fica de su pa&iacute;s, cuyo proyecto haya sido aprobado
por la Comunidad. Finalmente, el programa patrocina otra serie
de actividades de contenido investigador, tales como work shops,
congresos y conferencias. </P>
<P>
Como el programa anterior, &eacute;ste est&aacute; restringido
a las investigaciones de car&aacute;cter indirecto o pre-competitivo,
relacionadas con la formaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica y profesional
y la informaci&oacute;n en los pa&iacute;ses referidos. </P>
<P>
<B>IV Programa Marco de I+D de la CE </P></B>
<P>
La Comunidad utiliza como instrumento base de su pol&iacute;tica
en materia de investigaci&oacute;n y desarrollo cient&iacute;fico
y tecnol&oacute;gico, programas globales llamados Programas Marco
de Investigaci&oacute;n y Desarrollo Tecnol&oacute;gico. Estos
Programas Marco fijan los objetivos cient&iacute;ficos y tecnol&oacute;gicos
a ser alcanzados por la Comunidad mediante acciones concretas,
cuya finalidad ser&iacute;a la de promover el fortalecimiento
de las bases cient&iacute;ficas y tecnol&oacute;gicas de la industria
europea, y favorecer al desarrollo de su competitividad internacional.
</P>
<P>
Los Programas Marco poseen una duraci&oacute;n de cuatro a&ntilde;os.
El primero de ellos naci&oacute; en septiembre de 1984 y comprendi&oacute;
el per&iacute;odo de 1984 a 1987, el segundo de 1987 a 1991 y,
en abril de 1990, el Consejo de Ministros adopta el III Programa
Marco Comunitario de I+D Tecnol&oacute;gico <a href="#32">(32)</a>. </P>
<P>
En la actualidad, la Comunidad est&aacute; en la tarea de formalizar
el IV Programa Marco de Investigaci&oacute;n, Desarrollo Tecnol&oacute;gico
y Demostraci&oacute;n, que comprende el per&iacute;odo de 1994
a 1998 <a href="#33">(33)</a>. </P>
<P>
El Tercer Programa Marco (1990-1994) posee tres &aacute;reas de
dominio prioritario: la tecnolog&iacute;a de la informaci&oacute;n
y de las comunicaciones, la gesti&oacute;n de los recursos naturales
y el aprovechamiento de los recursos intelectuales <a href="#34">(34)</a>, que est&aacute;n
subdivididos en seis l&iacute;neas de acci&oacute;n (capital humano,
energ&iacute;a, ciencias de los seres vivos, medio ambiente, tecnolog&iacute;as
materiales e industriales y tecnolog&iacute;a de la informaci&oacute;n
y comunicaci&oacute;n) y en 15 programas espec&iacute;ficos <a href="#35">(35)</a>,
entre los cuales se encuentra el STD (Ciencia y Tecnolog&iacute;a
al Servicio del Desarrollo) relativo a la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
internacional con los PVD. </P>
<P>
El Tercer Programa Marco represent&oacute;, en comparaci&oacute;n
al programa anterior, un cierto cambio cualitativo en relaci&oacute;n
a las prioridades en materia de investigaci&oacute;n comunitaria,
donde el medio ambiente, la biotecnolog&iacute;a y la movilidad
y formaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica ganan un papel m&aacute;s
pronunciado. </P>
<P>
El Cuarto Programa sigue las l&iacute;neas del anterior, con algunas
novedades en cuanto a objetivos y estructura. Este nuevo instrumento
tiene tres ejes fundamentales: el apoyo a la competitividad de
la industria europea mediante el fortalecimiento de las bases
cient&iacute;ficas y tecnol&oacute;gicas comunitarias, la contribuci&oacute;n
de la ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a a las necesidades sociales,
y el apoyo a las diferentes pol&iacute;ticas comunes en materia
de I+D <a href="#36">(36)</a>. Su estructura se compone de cuatro acciones. La primera,
respecto a los campos de investigaci&oacute;n prioritarios, se
resume en siete &aacute;reas de investigaci&oacute;n: tecnolog&iacute;a
de la informaci&oacute;n y de las comunicaciones, tecnolog&iacute;as
industriales, medio ambiente, ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a de la
vida, energ&iacute;a, investigaci&oacute;n para una pol&iacute;tica
europea de transporte e investigaci&oacute;n socioecon&oacute;mica
con fines propios. En principio, estas &aacute;reas de investigaci&oacute;n
ser&iacute;an exclusivas de la investigaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
de los Estados miembros, realizadas entre s&iacute; o en conjunto
con terceros pa&iacute;ses industrializados, prioritariamente
con los pa&iacute;ses industrializados del resto del continente
Europeo y las dos grandes potencias mundiales: Jap&oacute;n y
Estados Unidos, importantes competidores de la industria Europea.
</P>
<P>
La segunda acci&oacute;n versa sobre la cooperaci&oacute;n internacional
de la Comunidad, donde se establece que los PVD con suficiente
potencial cient&iacute;fico podr&iacute;an participar en determinados
programas establecidos en la primera acci&oacute;n <a href="#37">(37)</a>. De esta
manera se provee la posibilidad a determinados pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos
de participar en programas espec&iacute;ficos de I+D propios de
la Comunidad, de contenido elevado. En esta acci&oacute;n se intenta,
desde el prisma comunitario, integrar distintas iniciativas de
investigaci&oacute;n a partir de un enfoque global y coordinado,
en sinergia con la actuaci&oacute;n en la ayuda al desarrollo.
Los temas prioritarios versan preferentemente, sobre recursos
naturales renovables y su empleo para la mejora sostenible de
la producci&oacute;n agraria, sobre la protecci&oacute;n del medio
ambiente y sobre la investigaci&oacute;n sanitaria para el desarrollo.
Finalmente, la tercera acci&oacute;n trata sobre la difusi&oacute;n
y explotaci&oacute;n de los resultados obtenidos por las actividades
de investigaci&oacute;n, motivando sobre todo la mejora en la
competitividad de las industrias comunitarias y en las dem&aacute;s
orientaciones establecidas por el Tratado de Uni&oacute;n Europea,
principalmente en sus art&iacute;culos 130F a 130P sobre investigaci&oacute;n
y desarrollo tecnol&oacute;gico. </P>
<P>
<B>Proyecto COLUMBUS</B> </P>
<P>
En el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n europea en materia
de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, se desarrolla en 1987 el proyecto
COLUMBUS <a href="#38">(38)</a> de movilidad universitaria entre Europa y Am&eacute;rica
Latina. Sus principales objetivos son favorecer el desarrollo
de universidades latinoamericanas, adapt&aacute;ndolas al cambio
de las circunstancias internacionales, aprovechando experiencias
de universidades europeas e incrementando el intercambio entre
ambas regiones <a href="#39">(39)</a>. </P>
<P>
Este proyecto nace en Buenos Aires, patrocinado por la Conferencia
de Rectores Europeos (CRE). Se estructura en dos etapas; la primera
de 1987 a 1992 y la segunda, de marzo de 1993 hasta 1997, con
tres l&iacute;neas b&aacute;sicas de actuaci&oacute;n: el desarrollo
de un foro de intercambio entre las pol&iacute;ticas y experiencias
de las universidades latinoamericanas y europeas, con la identificaci&oacute;n
de problemas comunes institucionales, el estudio conjunto de sus
soluciones y la cooperaci&oacute;n en la gesti&oacute;n universitaria
y la promoci&oacute;n de la autoevaluaci&oacute;n del papel de
las universidades <a href="#40">(40)</a> frente a los nuevos retos existentes, principalmente
en el campo de las relaciones entre universidad-sector productivo.
</P>
<P>
Este proyecto no significa &uacute;nicamente la cooperaci&oacute;n
entendida por movilidad y formaci&oacute;n universitaria; busca
ser el catalizador del cambio universitario, ultrapasa la cl&aacute;sica
asistencia t&eacute;cnica de los PI a los PVD. Es un instrumento
de transferencia de t&eacute;cnicas y conocimientos y promueve
el desarrollo estrat&eacute;gico a largo plazo. Para tales fines
establece: foros permanentes entre universidades latinoamericanas
y europeas; la promoci&oacute;n de medios de intercambio de experiencias,
para el establecimiento y desarrollo de incubadoras y centros
de innovaciones entre universidades, empresas, agencias y otros
grupos locales, a fin de promover el desarrollo equilibrado de
la transferencia tecnol&oacute;gica y su mejor gesti&oacute;n;
enlaces entre estudiantes posgraduados, para investigaci&oacute;n
y entrenamiento en las a&eacute;reas relacionadas, con el desarrollo
sostenible y el desarrollo de la evaluaci&oacute;n e investigaci&oacute;n
realizadas mediante la consolidaci&oacute;n del cambio, a trav&eacute;s
de nuevas regulaciones y posturas universitarias <a href="#41">(41)</a>. </P>
<P>
El coste estimado para la ejecuci&oacute;n de este programa, en
el per&iacute;odo de 1987-1993, es de 2,4 millones de d&oacute;lares,
siendo el 50% cubierto por la Comisi&oacute;n de las Comunidades
Europeas. Las contribuciones <a href="#42">(42)</a> de las organizaciones gubernamentales
locales y de otros participantes representaron el 40% del coste
del proyecto. </P>
<P>
<B>Mecanismos de Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica y T&eacute;cnica
de Am&eacute;rica Latina</B> </P>
<P>
Am&eacute;rica Latina, tras una d&eacute;cada de frustraciones,
comienza los noventa con nuevos desaf&iacute;os a los que debe
enfrentarse. Las tendencias hacia un nuevo orden econ&oacute;mico
globalizado, multipolar, tecnificado, ya son evidencias. Para
acompa&ntilde;ar las nuevas inclinaciones internacionales y romper
el cerco de su propio subdesarrollo adopta distintas posturas,
dejando de lado criterios tradicionales de protecci&oacute;n y
de reserva de mercado, a trav&eacute;s de pol&iacute;ticas din&aacute;micas
de apertura econ&oacute;mica dependientes de la competitividad
internacional <a href="#43">(43)</a>. </P>
<P>
La transformaci&oacute;n que sufre esta regi&oacute;n para su
inserci&oacute;n en este mundo menos protegido y m&aacute;s competitivo,
pasa necesariamente por la modernizaci&oacute;n de sus estructuras
sociales y econ&oacute;micas. </P>
<P>
Entre las diversas experiencias de la modificaci&oacute;n experimentada,
puede ser que la m&aacute;s importante consista en el aprendizaje
de que, en el futuro, el crecimiento se basar&aacute; cada vez
m&aacute;s en la incorporaci&oacute;n de conocimientos e innovaciones
t&eacute;cnicas a las funciones productivas <a href="#44">(44)</a>. Es en base a
estas directrices y a la certeza de que su modernizaci&oacute;n
y su consiguiente crecimiento econ&oacute;mico dependen de su
grado de vinculaci&oacute;n exterior y del grado de integraci&oacute;n
regional en enfrentar los formidables rectos del desarrollo, que
Am&eacute;rica Latina lanza dos programas relativos a la colaboraci&oacute;n
regional e internacional en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a,
el Programa Bol&iacute;var, y el Mercado Com&uacute;n del Conocimiento,
los cuales ser&aacute;n analizados a continuaci&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
<B>Programa Bol&iacute;var</B> </P>
<P>
Una de las respuestas al desarrollo de los cambios estructurales
emprendidos por Am&eacute;rica Latina consiste en la sinergia
entre la Industria, la Investigaci&oacute;n, la Innovaci&oacute;n
y la Integraci&oacute;n. Con la finalidad de hacer efectiva tal
relaci&oacute;n nace el Programa Bol&iacute;var, de Integraci&oacute;n
Tecnol&oacute;gica Regional, Innovaci&oacute;n y Competitividad
Industrial, fruto de una alianza realizada por el programa regional
de vinculaci&oacute;n entre los sectores productivos y de investigaci&oacute;n
cient&iacute;fica, denominado Entidades Latinoamericanas Cient&iacute;ficas
y Empresariales (ENLACE), creado a partir de las actividades del
Grupo de Reflexi&oacute;n, instituido por el Banco Interamericano
de Desarrollo (BID) en cooperaci&oacute;n con la UNESCO (Naciones
Unidas para la Educaci&oacute;n, la Ciencia y la Cultura <a href="#45">(45)</a>).
Y de la iniciativa Bol&iacute;var (de Integraci&oacute;n Tecnol&oacute;gica
Regional, la Innovaci&oacute;n y la Competitividad Industrial)
el Gobierno de Venezuela, con las mismas caracter&iacute;sticas
del anterior <a href="#46">(46)</a>. </P>
<P>
El Programa Bol&iacute;var es un organismo no gubernamental, con
personalidad jur&iacute;dica de derecho privado, constituido en
Caracas el 31 de marzo de 1992, tras la creaci&oacute;n en noviembre
de 1990 de su Comit&eacute; Enlace. Tiene algunas caracter&iacute;sticas
propias como: su car&aacute;cter regional, el cual intenta fomentar
la integraci&oacute;n de los sectores tecnol&oacute;gicos, de
producci&oacute;n, financiero, comercial y la innovaci&oacute;n
industrial, facilitando la asociaci&oacute;n de empresas y/o centros
de investigaci&oacute;n de dos o m&aacute;s pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica
Latina; en otras palabras, vincula parcelas acad&eacute;micas
a sectores industriales latinoamericanos <a href="#47">(47)</a>. Es de gesti&oacute;n
mixta: iniciativa privada y sector p&uacute;blico, con geometr&iacute;a
variable, sus procedimientos respetan las caracter&iacute;sticas
de cada pa&iacute;s y subregi&oacute;n, y con gran flexibilidad,
toda iniciativa parte de intereses concretos de sus participantes.
</P>
<P>
Este programa se desarrolla simult&aacute;neamente en tres niveles.
El primero mediante las Comisiones Nacionales, que agregan a una
representaci&oacute;n plural los factores de decisi&oacute;n de
cada pa&iacute;s miembro. Est&aacute;n constituidas, generalmente,
por personalidades vinculadas a empresas, universidades, organismos
estatales, centros de investigaci&oacute;n, etc, cuya finalidad
es la de constituir lobbies para crear localmente un clima favorable
para las actividades del programa y para los conceptos que se
le asocian (integraci&oacute;n regional, investigaci&oacute;n
aplicada, la innovaci&oacute;n, la inserci&oacute;n internacional,
etc...). Hasta la mitad de 1993, eran dieciocho los Estados latinoamericanos
con representaci&oacute;n en las Comisiones Nacionales. </P>
<P>
En un segundo nivel est&aacute;n las ONE (Oficinas Nacionales
de Enlaces), que representan la c&eacute;lula fundamental del
mecanismo operativo del programa, pues, es en ella que se desarrolla
toda la fase t&eacute;cnica de recepci&oacute;n, evaluaci&oacute;n
y promoci&oacute;n de los proyectos hasta la etapa del financiamiento
o hasta el tercer nivel, que se constituye en una red de instituciones
nacionales, regionales e internacionales financieras, llamadas
Men&uacute; Financiero, las cuales facilitan el acceso al financiamiento
de los proyectos objeto del programa. </P>
<P>
Los objetivos fundamentales de este instrumento de cooperaci&oacute;n
son la mejora de la calidad de los productos, procesos y servicios
latinoamericanos a fin de alcanzar normas de calidad internacional
homog&eacute;neas, adem&aacute;s de posibilitar la creaci&oacute;n
de nuevos productos, procesos y servicios, potenciando la capacidad
productiva existente en cada pa&iacute;s mediante el fomento a
la creaci&oacute;n de empresas conjuntas o joint ventures entre
empresas y/o instituciones de dos o m&aacute;s pa&iacute;ses de
la regi&oacute;n o de otras regiones; y tambi&eacute;n posibilitar
la circulaci&oacute;n y democratizaci&oacute;n del conocimiento
a trav&eacute;s de dise&ntilde;os de redes de cooperaci&oacute;n
entre investigadores y acad&eacute;micos de diversos pa&iacute;ses.
</P>
<P>
En el &aacute;mbito de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, este mecanismo
intenta, adem&aacute;s, conectar los sectores de la innovaci&oacute;n,
de la ciencia y de la tecnolog&iacute;a con el sector productivo.
En este caso, la investigaci&oacute;n es aplicada y est&aacute;
direccionada al desarrollo cient&iacute;fico y tecnol&oacute;gico
de la regi&oacute;n latinoamericana. El impacto de este programa
en los sistemas cient&iacute;ficos y tecnol&oacute;gicos de la
regi&oacute;n, puede medirse por su capacidad en identificar y
poner en contacto socios potenciales, facilitar el financiamiento
de proyectos conjuntos de desarrollo tecnol&oacute;gico entre
pa&iacute;ses de la regi&oacute;n o de otras regiones. </P>
<P>
La Comunidad ha reconocido como ejemplo de cooperaci&oacute;n
internacional el Programa Bol&iacute;var a trav&eacute;s de la
comunicaci&oacute;n oficial de la Comisi&oacute;n al Consejo y
al Parlamento Europeo, sobre La pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n
al desarrollo en el horizonte del 2000. Aplicaci&oacute;n del
Tratado de Maastricht (Bruselas, 15.05.92). En la segunda reuni&oacute;n
institucional entre el Grupo de R&iacute;o y la Comunidad se tom&oacute;
nota de la cooperaci&oacute;n mutua del Programa Bol&iacute;var
y posteriormente se realiz&oacute; el primer convenio entre este
instrumento y el Programa Comunitario de Ciencia y Tecnolog&iacute;a
(Eureka), mediante la intervenci&oacute;n de la comisi&oacute;n
portuguesa del programa Eureka, formalizando los esfuerzos en
garantizar la realizaci&oacute;n de negocios y proyectos que involucren
empresas y centros investigadores latinoamericanos y portugueses.
Se refleja, adem&aacute;s, la voluntad y posibilidad de profundizar
las relaciones del programa Bol&iacute;var con la Comunidad <a href="#48">(48)</a>.
</P>
<P>
En la actualidad este programa ha recibido 110 proyectos, se han
identificados socios potenciales para 33 de &eacute;stos y 17
han respondido afirmativamente a la posibilidad de asociarse.
Las &aacute;reas involucradas abarcaban aspectos tales como: agroalimentos,
autopartes, biotecnolog&iacute;a, catalizadores, dise&ntilde;o,
electr&oacute;nica, materiales, metalmec&aacute;nica y telecomunicaciones.
</P>
<P>
Este mecanismo cuenta con los aportes no reembolsables provenientes
del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) de 4,2 millones de
d&oacute;lares, del Gobierno venezolano de 1,1 millones de d&oacute;lares,
de sectores privados de tres millones de d&oacute;lares y contribuciones
de organismos internacionales como la SELA y la UNESCO <a href="#49">(49)</a>. </P>
<P>
<B>Mercado Com&uacute;n del Conocimiento</B> </P>
<P>
A propuesta del presidente de Uruguay, Dr. Luis Alberto Lacalle,
en la Asamblea General de la Organizaci&oacute;n de Estados Americanos
(OEA) de junio de 1990 <a href="#50">(50)</a>, se desarrolla la idea de la realizaci&oacute;n
de un mercado com&uacute;n del conocimiento para fomentar el intercambio
de conocimientos pre-competitivos, la integraci&oacute;n de las
capacidades t&eacute;cnicas del hemisferio, la mejor participaci&oacute;n
de los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina y del Caribe en
el progreso t&eacute;cnico mundial, contribuyendo a la competitividad
productiva y bienestar social de la regi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
Para el efectivo desarrollo de este mercado, los Estados miembros
establecen un programa marco de cooperaci&oacute;n, en el cual
se integran mecanismos de cooperaci&oacute;n y programas de actividades
multilaterales, seleccionadas con criterio de excelencia y relevancia,
con base en evaluaciones independientes, para ser utilizados por
investigadores del hemisferio trabajando en colaboraci&oacute;n
entre s&iacute;, o con investigadores de otros pa&iacute;ses participantes
de Europa y Asia <a href="#51">(51)</a>. </P>
<P>
En el programa marco se estipulan las &aacute;reas de acci&oacute;n
prioritarias, a las que en un primer per&iacute;odo corresponder&iacute;a
la investigaci&oacute;n y formaci&oacute;n de pos grado y centros
regionales de excelencia, intercambio y revinculaci&oacute;n de
recursos humanos altamente cualificados, vinculaci&oacute;n de
las universidades y centros de investigaci&oacute;n y la formaci&oacute;n,
intercomunicaci&oacute;n y difusi&oacute;n de los conocimientos
t&eacute;cnicos y cient&iacute;ficos. </P>
<P>
En materia de investigaci&oacute;n, formaci&oacute;n y redes,
este programa tiene tres componentes principales: la creaci&oacute;n
de una red de asociaciones entre universidades y empresas para
la formaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica avanzada, los intercambios
transnacionales y los proyectos conjuntos de entrenamiento en
alta tecnolog&iacute;a. Entre las l&iacute;neas de trabajo con
posibilidad de acci&oacute;n conjunta con empresas figuran las
siguientes materias: medio ambiente, alimentaci&oacute;n, comunicaciones,
capacitaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos, gesti&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas,
programas y proyectos de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, conocimientos
de la oferta y la demanda de las capacidades de investigaci&oacute;n
y apoyo a la innovaci&oacute;n, metodolog&iacute;a y normalizaci&oacute;n,
complementaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos, qu&iacute;mica, bioqu&iacute;mica
y petroqu&iacute;mica, metalurgia y mineralog&iacute;a <a href="#52">(52)</a>. </P>
<P>
El mercado com&uacute;n de conocimientos supervisa sobre todo
la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y tecnol&oacute;gica para
el desarrollo de Am&eacute;rica Latina y el Caribe, en este sentido
fomenta: la capacitaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos de las regiones
citadas; la cooperaci&oacute;n de pa&iacute;ses del hemisferio,
o externos a &eacute;ste, en materia de investigaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
y tecnol&oacute;gica; y los servicios de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a
y la informaci&oacute;n sobre tales materias. Y est&aacute; dirigido
esencialmente a universidades de la regi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
<a name=con></a><h3>Consideraciones finales: la perspectiva de la cooperaci&#243;n cient&#237;fica y t&#233;cnica de la Comunidad y Latinoam&#233;rica</h3>
</P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n y desarrollo de la CE se concentraba originariamente,
como se ha mencionado, en los pa&iacute;ses asociados del ACP
y los pa&iacute;ses del mediterr&aacute;neo. A partir de 1976,
esta pol&iacute;tica conoce un nuevo desarrollo, en direcci&oacute;n
hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia, donde adem&aacute;s de acuerdos
comerciales, se inicia una pol&iacute;tica de inversiones financiada
por el presupuesto comunitario <a href="#53">(53)</a>. </P>
<P>
De la cooperaci&oacute;n total de la CE con los pa&iacute;ses
no asociados, Am&eacute;rica Latina recibi&oacute;, entre 1976
a 1986 <a href="#54">(54)</a>, poco m&aacute;s del 25% de la cooperaci&oacute;n
total, mientras que a Asia se destin&oacute; el 75% del total.
Este cuadro empieza a cambiar a finales de la d&eacute;cada de
los ochenta, fij&aacute;ndose una participaci&oacute;n latinoamericana
m&aacute;s equilibrada. Concretamente, en 1988 el 33% del total
de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo de la Comunidad fue direccionado
hacia esta regi&oacute;n, en 1990 &eacute;ste sube al 39% y, finalmente,
en 1994 llega al 44%. </P>
<P>
Esta modificaci&oacute;n de postura se debe a varios factores
significativos, tales como la institucionalizaci&oacute;n del
di&aacute;logo CE y el Grupo de R&iacute;o y, sin duda, la visi&oacute;n
actual en Latinoam&eacute;rica de la nueva situaci&oacute;n del
desarrollo, dependiente de los condicionamentos externos. Ambos
factores analizados aqu&iacute; con anterioridad. </P>
<P>
Desde otro &aacute;ngulo, adem&aacute;s de la evoluci&oacute;n
cuantitativa de la cooperaci&oacute;n hacia Latinoam&eacute;rica,
cabr&iacute;a destacar la evoluci&oacute;n cualitativa de estas
operaciones. Desde la citada Orientaciones para el fortalecimiento
de las relaciones de la Comunidad y Am&eacute;rica Latina de 1984,
se propon&iacute;a un mayor &eacute;nfasis en otras formas de
cooperaci&oacute;n, frente a la cooperaci&oacute;n tradicional
de ayuda al desarrollo; que promoviera el beneficio mutuo entre
las partes y una pol&iacute;tica m&aacute;s espec&iacute;fica
para esta regi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
Confirmando este precepto Orientaciones de la CE para la Cooperaci&oacute;n
con los Pa&iacute;ses en Desarrollo de Am&eacute;rica Latina y
Asia, del 11 de junio de 1990, impulsan el desarrollo de la cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica, cuando la definen como uno de los ejes principales
de la cooperaci&oacute;n de la CE. En este sentido cabr&iacute;a
destacar el aumento significativo del porcentaje de la cooperaci&oacute;n
avanzada, en el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo
en general de la Comunidad hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina, &eacute;sta
pasa en 1986 del 5% de la cooperaci&oacute;n total, al 21% en
1991 y al 16% en 1992 <a href="#55">(55)</a>. </P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica se caracteriza por tres
grandes &aacute;mbitos de intervenci&oacute;n; entre ellos destaca
la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica. La evoluci&oacute;n
de esta clase de colaboraci&oacute;n se remonta a las Orientaciones
de 1984, cuando la mencionaba como elemento principal de la cooperaci&oacute;n
industrial. Del mismo modo, en el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n
bilateral, o bilateral colectiva, los acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n
firmados entre la CE y algunos pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos
<a href="#56">(56)</a> a partir de la d&eacute;cada de los noventa, todos contienen
apartados espec&iacute;ficos sobre la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
y tecnol&oacute;gica. </P>
<P>
Finalmente, dentro del di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico CE-Grupo
de R&iacute;o, desde la Conferencia de Roma de 1990, se define
en la ciencia y la tecnolog&iacute;a como &aacute;reas fundamentales
de cooperaci&oacute;n. En la Conferencia de Luxemburgo los pa&iacute;ses
latinoamericanos manifiestan su deseo de participaci&oacute;n
en programas de investigaci&oacute;n comunitarios en ciencia y
tecnolog&iacute;a y, finalmente, en la segunda reuni&oacute;n
Ministerial entre la CE y el Grupo de R&iacute;o <a href="#57">(57)</a> los ministros
de la CE se&ntilde;alaron la apertura al Programa Marco Comunitario
a investigadores de los pa&iacute;ses del grupo, en algunas &aacute;reas
espec&iacute;ficas <a href="#58">(58)</a>. Se esperaba una mayor participaci&oacute;n
latinoamericana en diferentes &aacute;reas de las investigaciones
comunitarias y en los resultados de &eacute;sta, con el acuerdo
del IV Programa marco de Investigaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad,
instrumento que posiblemente colaborar&aacute; para la transferencia
y el acceso de conocimientos y t&eacute;cnicas, por parte de los
PVD-AL, elementos que deben ser, cada vez m&aacute;s, los ejes
que presidan las relaciones y la cooperaci&oacute;n entre los
pa&iacute;ses industrializados y los en desarrollo. </P>

<A NAME="abs"><h3>Abstract:</h3><P></A>
<H3>The new foreign policy of the European Union and the member
countries of the Andean Pact</H3>
<P>
The present article can be placed within the context of an analysis
of the Foreign Relations of the European Union and the Member
Countries of the Cartagena Accord or Andean Pact.
<P>
In the first half of the article an analysis is carried out of
the legal framework within which the foreign relations of both
the European Union and Andean Pact countries are developed together
with some observations on the whole context of the new Agreement
signed on the 15th April 1993. The evolutionary process in the
realm of trade relations is a developed theme as well as the implications
of the application of the Generalized System of Preferences as
a principal mechanism of cooperation with the Andean region. Finally,
this first half concludes presenting an exhaustive analysis of
investment flows.
<P>
The second part of the article consists of the study of development
assistance as well as economic cooperation. As far as development
assistance goes, we can observe in detail what such action together
with its restructuring has meant for the Developing Countries.
As for economic cooperation, we can confirm that these mechanisms
have not achieved those previously-established objectives, and
have led to reiterated complaints on behalf of the countries of
the Andean region. Finally, the article concludes with the presentation
of final observations and offers three reasons which call for
the strengthening of ties in the context of relations between
the European Union and those signatories of the Cartagena Agreement.

<a name=int><h3>Introducci&#243;n</h3>
<P>
En la actualidad sabemos que acontecimientos tan significativos
como la reactivaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica latinoamericana y
la revitalizaci&oacute;n de los procesos de integraci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica regional constituyen, en la d&eacute;cada de
los noventa, actores fundamentales del nuevo modelo de desarrollo
econ&oacute;mico regional. </P>
<P>
La regi&oacute;n andina, no pod&iacute;a ser de otra manera, ha
sido parte importante de este nuevo contexto de reactivaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica regional, con la salvedad que representa la marcada
heterogeneidad econ&oacute;mica e industrial de sus pa&iacute;ses
miembros. </P>
<P>
Las relaciones institucionales entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y
los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena o Pacto Andino,
a lo largo de su evoluci&oacute;n, no se han distinguido por una
com&uacute;n voluntad e intenci&oacute;n de cooperaci&oacute;n
rec&iacute;proca demasiado efectiva; pr&aacute;cticamente desde
la institucionalizaci&oacute;n del Acuerdo de Cartagena en el
a&ntilde;o 1969, hasta hoy en d&iacute;a y ya sea, por acontecimientos,
situaciones o hechos hist&oacute;ricos, las relaciones institucionales
se han visto involucradas en la ret&oacute;rica conformista de
las buenas intenciones y proposiciones rom&aacute;nticas como
son, tener un pasado hist&oacute;rico com&uacute;n, una cultura
semejante y una estructura pol&iacute;tica an&aacute;loga. </P>
<P>
Actualmente, la realidad de la Europa comunitaria es distinta;
en concreto, desde la aplicaci&oacute;n del Acta &#218;nica
Europea, la Comunidad se ha visto en la necesidad de fortalecer
sus estructuras internas y consolidarse como una instituci&oacute;n
de integraci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica, pol&iacute;tica y social;
prueba de ello, ha sido la firma del Tratado de la Uni&oacute;n
Europea, el siete de febrero de 1992, en Maastricht (Pa&iacute;ses
Bajos). Dentro del &aacute;mbito de la reactivaci&oacute;n institucional
observado en la Comunidad, el a&ntilde;o emblem&aacute;tico de
1992 ha acaparado los objetivos de la realizaci&oacute;n de un
mercado integrado comunitario con la consolidaci&oacute;n de todas
y cada una de las pol&iacute;ticas comunitarias. En este mismo
contexto, la d&eacute;cada de los noventa ha servido para emprender
nuevas y ambiciosas acciones dentro del marco de la cooperaci&oacute;n
pol&iacute;tica exterior, con la finalidad de intensificar el
acercamiento y el conocimiento mutuo entre ambas regiones<a href="#1">(1)</a>.
</P>
<P>
<a name=mar></a><h3>El marco jur&#237;dico de las relaciones exteriores de la Uni&#243;n Europea y el Pacto Andino</h3> </P>
<P>
Al referirnos al marco jur&iacute;dico de las relaciones exteriores
entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y los pa&iacute;ses miembros del
Acuerdo de Cartagena, constatamos que al instituirse la Comunidad
Econ&oacute;mica Europea (CEE), sus creadores no se preocuparon
en dotarla de una pol&iacute;tica exterior com&uacute;n en sus
relaciones con terceros pa&iacute;ses; aunque tambi&eacute;n es
cierto y en su favor se puede decir, que la CEE cont&oacute; con
una Cooperaci&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica Europea, que nace en la
Cumbre de La Haya en diciembre del a&ntilde;o 1969<a href="#2">(2)</a>. </P>
<P>
Con la entrada en vigor del Acta &#218;nica Europea, en enero
del a&ntilde;o 1987, se profundiza la Cooperaci&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica
Europea (T&iacute;tulo III, art. 30), dado que por primera vez
se establece en el Tratado de Roma una Pol&iacute;tica Exterior
Europea<a href="#3">(3)</a>; pero desafortunadamente la medida adoptada por la
Comunidad no tuvo el &eacute;xito esperado y en alguno de sus
pa&iacute;ses miembros, como es el caso de Dinamarca, se opt&oacute;
por permanecer al margen de toda participaci&oacute;n en la aplicaci&oacute;n
de la Cooperaci&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica Europea. En consecuencia,
la Cooperaci&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica se constituy&oacute; sencillamente
en un sistema de informaci&oacute;n y consulta a nivel diplom&aacute;tico
entre los pa&iacute;ses miembros, dado que los mecanismos creados
en el Acta &ograve;nica Europea demostraron ser insuficientes
en su prop&oacute;sito de dotarla de una verdadera Pol&iacute;tica
Exterior Com&uacute;n, ya que s&oacute;lo permit&iacute;an una
relativa coordinaci&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica exterior de
los pa&iacute;ses miembros. </P>
<P>
A principios de la d&eacute;cada de los a&ntilde;os noventa, diferentes
acontecimientos ocurridos en la esfera internacional dejaron en
evidencia, una vez m&aacute;s, la necesidad de establecer una
Pol&iacute;tica Exterior y de Seguridad Com&uacute;n; lo cual
provoc&oacute; manifiestamente que la actuaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad
Europea como mero observador pasase a constituirse en un elemento
activo de pleno derecho en la Comunidad Internacional, dado que
la mayor&iacute;a de los acontecimientos y focos de conflictos
se suced&iacute;an en el Continente Europeo o, por lo menos, dentro
de lo que se conoce o se denomina como el per&iacute;metro de
influencia o acci&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica exterior comunitaria.
</P>
<P>
Con la firma del Tratado de Maastricht<a href="#4">(4)</a> -en vigor desde el
uno de noviembre de 1993- se crean las primeras disposiciones
concernientes a la Pol&iacute;tica Exterior y de Seguridad Com&uacute;n
(t&iacute;tulo del Tratado de la Uni&oacute;n Europea). Dentro
de este nuevo contexto de acci&oacute;n, la naciente Pol&iacute;tica
Exterior y de Seguridad Com&uacute;n (PESC) establece como objetivos
principales, defender los valores comunes como la independencia
de la Uni&oacute;n; fortalecer su seguridad y la de sus pa&iacute;ses
miembros; mantener la paz, robustecer la seguridad internacional
en el marco de los principios de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas,
as&iacute; como tambi&eacute;n los principios del Acta de Helsinki
y los objetivos de la Carta de Par&iacute;s; favorecer la cooperaci&oacute;n
internacional y la consolidaci&oacute;n de la democracia, respetando
los Derechos Humanos y las libertades fundamentales (art. J1).
Para alcanzar dichos objetivos se prev&eacute; en el futuro una
cooperaci&oacute;n sistem&aacute;tica entre sus pa&iacute;ses
miembros (art. J2), ya que a sus efectos se la dota de un procedimiento
capaz de poner en pr&aacute;ctica la nueva Pol&iacute;tica Exterior
y de Seguridad Com&uacute;n (art. J3). Asimismo, se establece
que la presidencia de la Uni&oacute;n Europea ser&aacute; la responsable
de la ejecuci&oacute;n de las acciones comunes y asumir&aacute;
a la vez, la representaci&oacute;n y actuaci&oacute;n que tendr&aacute;
la Uni&oacute;n ante las organizaciones internacionales (art.
J5). Por otro lado, el Consejo Europeo ser&aacute; el que defina
los principios y orientaciones de la Uni&oacute;n como tambi&eacute;n,
el que ejecute la nueva Pol&iacute;tica Exterior y de Seguridad
Com&uacute;n (art. J8). Finalmente, la Comisi&oacute;n tendr&aacute;
por finalidad colaborar en los objetivos a realizar por la Uni&oacute;n
Europea en el marco de la PESC. </P>
<P>
En lo que a las relaciones exteriores de la Uni&oacute;n Europea
y el Acuerdo de Cartagena concierne, se observa que &eacute;stas
se realizan de dos maneras: la relaci&oacute;n nacional, Uni&oacute;n
Europea - pa&iacute;ses miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena, y la
relaci&oacute;n regional o institucional, Comisi&oacute;n Europea
- Junta del Acuerdo de Cartagena. </P>
<P>
Las relaciones institucionales entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y
el Grupo Andino se han caracterizado desde un principio por dos
etapas cronol&oacute;gicas que comprenden el per&iacute;odo de
la d&eacute;cada de los a&ntilde;os setenta y el per&iacute;odo
1981-1992; concretamente, desde la creaci&oacute;n del Acuerdo
de Cartagena<a href="#5">(5)</a> hasta la firma del nuevo Acuerdo Marco CE-Pacto
Andino, suscrito en abril de 1993. </P>
<P>
Dentro de este contexto evolutivo hist&oacute;rico, constatamos
que la d&eacute;cada de los setenta se inicia con la puesta en
pr&aacute;ctica del Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias (SGP)
y la instituci&oacute;n de la Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo
con la Ayuda Financiera y T&eacute;cnica. Asimismo, se observa
que esta primera etapa se cierra con la ruptura de las relaciones
institucionales, al interrumpirse el proceso democr&aacute;tico
institucional de Bolivia en julio de 1980. </P>
<P>
En lo que respecta a la d&eacute;cada de los ochenta, se advierte
que dicho per&iacute;odo comienza con una interrupci&oacute;n
de las relaciones de casi tres a&ntilde;os (1980-1983), como consecuencia
de las secuelas de la ruptura democr&aacute;tica del sistema institucional
boliviano, que, como ya apuntamos con anterioridad, provoc&oacute;
el resquebrajamiento de las relaciones institucionales CEE-Grupo
Andino. </P>
<P>
Una vez analizados los acontecimientos, es f&aacute;cil observar
que la d&eacute;cada de los ochenta constituye el per&iacute;odo
m&aacute;s importante dentro de la evoluci&oacute;n de las relaciones
institucionales, sobre todo por los resultados satisfactorios
alcanzados en el marco de las relaciones exteriores; concretamente,
es en esta d&eacute;cada cuando se firma el primer Acuerdo Marco
de Cooperaci&oacute;n Comunidad Econ&oacute;mica Europea - pa&iacute;ses
miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena (instituido en 1983 y en vigor
desde el 1987)<a href="#6">(6)</a>. </P>
<P>
Finalmente, es necesario mencionar que dentro del marco del proceso
evolutivo de las relaciones exteriores CEE/Pacto Andino se constata
que, a finales de la d&eacute;cada de los ochenta, las relaciones
comerciales entre ambas instituciones se han visto sustancialmente
reducidas, por causas atribuibles ya sea, a la Comunidad Europea
como tambi&eacute;n a los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino
y a la evoluci&oacute;n de las relaciones econ&oacute;micas internacionales.
Con el objetivo de subsanar el deteriorado marco de las relaciones
CE-Pacto Andino, en abril de 1993 se ha firmado un nuevo acuerdo
marco de cooperaci&oacute;n denominado de tercera generaci&oacute;n;
documento del que se espera que en el futuro satisfaga los intereses
de ambas partes. </P>
<P>
<a name=nue></a><h3>El nuevo acuerdo marco de cooperaci&#243;n</h3> </P>
<P>
Como antes hemos apuntado, en la d&eacute;cada de los noventa
la Uni&oacute;n Europea inicia en sus relaciones con Am&eacute;rica
Latina una nueva etapa en los &aacute;mbitos tanto de cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica, como comercial, financiera y t&eacute;cnica
as&iacute; como de desarrollo. En &eacute;ste nuevo contexto de
actuaci&oacute;n la Uni&oacute;n Europea ha dise&ntilde;ado una
moderna pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n dotada sobre todo
de nuevos mecanismos y mayores recursos financieros (t&iacute;tulo
XVII, arts. 130 U al 130 Y, Tratado de la Uni&oacute;n Europea).
Asimismo, dentro del marco de la actual orientaci&oacute;n de
la Cooperaci&oacute;n, la Uni&oacute;n Europea ha concluido una
serie de nuevos acuerdos marcos de cooperaci&oacute;n pr&aacute;cticamente
con la totalidad de los pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos (excepci&oacute;n
hecha de Cuba), con el objetivo de reforzar tanto el aspecto econ&oacute;mico
como el di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico entre ambas regiones. </P>
<P>
En la esfera de este clima, manifiestamente favorable a la cooperaci&oacute;n
con los pa&iacute;ses miembros de Am&eacute;rica Latina, la CE
celebra el 15 de abril de 1993 un nuevo Acuerdo Marco de Cooperaci&oacute;n
con el Acuerdo de Cartagena y sus pa&iacute;ses miembros<a href="#7">(7)</a>.
El citado acuerdo se enmarca dentro de los llamados acuerdos de
tercera generaci&oacute;n, y se le otorga este calificativo por
el mayor grado de implicaci&oacute;n que representa para las partes
contratantes, as&iacute; como por la gran amplitud de su contenido
en los diversos &aacute;mbitos de la cooperaci&oacute;n. Concretamente,
los principios que m&aacute;s resaltan del nuevo acuerdo suscrito
con el Pacto Andino son: el fundamento democr&aacute;tico de la
cooperaci&oacute;n, la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica y sus
ramas afines, la cooperaci&oacute;n comercial y su diversidad
en el campo de la cooperaci&oacute;n industrial, la inversi&oacute;n,
la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y tecnol&oacute;gica,
la cooperaci&oacute;n global al desarrollo y otros campos de actualidad,
como son la lucha contra el narcotr&aacute;fico, la cooperaci&oacute;n
en materia social, el medio ambiente y la dotaci&oacute;n de una
serie de modernos medios para la realizaci&oacute;n de tales objetivos.
</P>
<P>
En resumen, se puede observar que el nuevo Acuerdo Marco Comunidad
Europea-Pacto Andino<a href="#8">(8)</a> engloba en su contexto toda una cadena
de nuevos instrumentos que pretenden fortalecer las ya de por
s&iacute; deterioradas relaciones CE - Grupo Andino. </P>
<P>
Una vez conocidos los antecedentes b&aacute;sicos del marco conceptual
en los que se desen-vuelven las relaciones institucionales Uni&oacute;n
Europea-Pacto Andino y, siguiendo la importancia que se refleja
en el &aacute;mbito de las relaciones Comunidad Europea-Grupo
Andino, el presente art&iacute;culo ha sido desarrollado metodol&oacute;gicamente
en dos partes. En la primera parte se analizaran las relaciones
comerciales de la Uni&oacute;n Europea con los pa&iacute;ses miembros
del Acuerdo de Cartagena y la segunda parte est&aacute; dedicada
al estudio de la Pol&iacute;tica Comunitaria de Cooperaci&oacute;n
al Desarrollo con los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino.
</P>
<P>
<a name=rel></a><h3>Las relaciones comerciales</h3> </P>
<P>
Dentro del &aacute;mbito de las relaciones Uni&oacute;n Europea
- Acuerdo de Cartagena, las relaciones comerciales en general
ocupan un lugar relativamente importante para los pa&iacute;ses
miembros del Grupo Andino, dado que el flujo comercial con la
Uni&oacute;n Europea representa alrededor del 20% de su comercio
total<a href="#9">(9)</a> (19,2% de las importaciones y el 18,2% de las exportaciones
totales). Y en lo que a la Comunidad Europea respecta, por el
contrario, se aprecia que el intercambio comercial con el Grupo
Andino es pr&aacute;cticamente insignificante, dado que apenas
representan el 1,5%, de su comercio mundial (1,5% de las importaciones
y 1,2% de las exportaciones totales); pero lo m&aacute;s cr&iacute;tico
del flujo comercial, no es la escasa importancia del valor de
la misma, sino que se encuentra en un nivel descendente gradual
y progresivo<a href="#10">(10)</a>. </P>
<P>
Desde sus inicio, observamos que las relaciones comerciales reflejan
una evoluci&oacute;n progresiva del intercambio comercial, habiendo
alcanzado en el per&iacute;odo de 1985 el list&oacute;n m&aacute;s
alto (11.398 millones de ecus)<a href="#11">(11)</a>. </P>
<P>
Actualmente, se puede apreciar que el flujo comercial Uni&oacute;n
Europea-Grupo Andino, ha registrado una sensible ca&iacute;da
y se encuentra en un nivel descendente ( 8.052 millones de ecus,
en 1992, seg&uacute;n datos de 1994), constituy&eacute;ndose la
regi&oacute;n andina en un socio comercial relativamente marginal
para la Uni&oacute;n Europea. </P>
<P>
En lo que a las estructuras de los intercambios comerciales respecta,
constatamos que las exportaciones de la Uni&oacute;n Europea a
los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino, est&aacute;n constituidas
mayoritariamente en un 56% por productos manufacturados industriales<a href="#12">(12)</a>; y, contrariamente, en lo que a las importaciones procedentes
de los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino concierne, el 82%
est&aacute; constituido por las materias primas, lo que provoca
que la asimetr&iacute;a existente en el comercio Uni&oacute;n
Europea-Acuerdo de Cartagena radique en el intercambio de productos
primarios de escaso nivel de elaboraci&oacute;n, por art&iacute;culos
m&aacute;s complejos y con un fuerte valor a&ntilde;adido, que
determina que los valores de las importaciones tiendan a la baja
y que, a la inversa, los precios de los productos importados suban
de forma constante, provocando el tan denunciado deterioro de
los t&eacute;rminos de intercambio que padece en general la industria
y el comercio latinoamericano. </P>
<P>
<B>El Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias</B> </P>
<P>
El Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias (SGP), como mecanismo
de cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo, constituye un medio para
inducir el desarrollo de los pa&iacute;ses en v&iacute;as de crecimiento
mediante la promoci&oacute;n de su comercio. El Sistema, como
objetivos prioritarios, tiene por finalidad elevar el ingreso
por exportaci&oacute;n, promover la industria y acelerar el crecimiento
de los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo. </P>
<P>
El Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias en s&iacute;, es una medida
pol&iacute;tica comercial que trae consigo la suspensi&oacute;n
de los derechos aduaneros a las importaciones de la Uni&oacute;n
Europea y se concede a todos los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo,
por lo tanto las preferencias no son discriminatorias sino de
car&aacute;cter aut&oacute;nomo, lo cual quiere decir que no se
negocian con los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios. Asimismo, se aplica
con algunas restricciones a los productos sensibles y a todos
los productos industriales acabados y semiacabados como tambi&eacute;n
a algunos productos agr&iacute;colas<a href="#13">(13)</a>. </P>
<P>
Su nombre, Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias, hace pensar en
primera instancia que se trata de un sistema que concede ventajas
a todos los productos; pero en la pr&aacute;ctica, esto no es
as&iacute;, ya que en su aplicaci&oacute;n existen numerosas excepciones
al sistema, por lo cual no es tan generalizado como en principio
se deduce de su nombre. </P>
<P>
Se trata de un mecanismo de ejecuci&oacute;n muy complejo y que
crea dudas. Digo complejo porque la gesti&oacute;n en s&iacute;
supone un coste desproporcionado en cuanto a tiempo, dinero, personal
y medios administrativos<a href="#14">(14)</a>; y dudoso porque genera incertidumbre
en los operadores econ&oacute;micos al realizarse la renovaci&oacute;n
anual del r&eacute;gimen, como tambi&eacute;n por el rigor del
sistema de los contingentes arancelarios y por los montantes fijos
que en ocasiones se agotan en los primeros d&iacute;as de cada
a&ntilde;o civil. Adem&aacute;s, tiene un car&aacute;cter aleatorio
y a veces discriminatorio entre los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios,
sobre todo en el establecimiento de los derechos aduaneros que
se realiza a lo largo de todo el a&ntilde;o para los productos
sujetos a l&iacute;mites m&aacute;ximos e incluso para los productos
no sensibles vigilados, a los que se aplica una base diferencial<a href="#15">(15)</a>. </P>
<P>
Una vez definidas las caracter&iacute;sticas del SGP, observamos
que el Sistema fue adoptado por la Comunidad el 1 de julio de
1971; asimismo, hay que destacar que la Uni&oacute;n Europea,
con el transcurrir de los a&ntilde;os, se ha preocupado en introducir
continuamente avances desde el punto de vista t&eacute;cnico y
organizativo, y es consciente de que cabe mejorarlo sobre todo
con el fin de hacerlo m&aacute;s transparente y estable<a href="#16">(16)</a>.
</P>
<P>
Por otro lado, en lo que a la utilizaci&oacute;n del Sistema Generalizado
de Preferencias por parte de los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo
Andino respecta, se observa que es variado y de forma irregular
tanto en funci&oacute;n de cada pa&iacute;s como de los a&ntilde;os.
Se aprecia que respecto a los pa&iacute;ses con un mayor grado
de industrializaci&oacute;n, como es el caso de Venezuela y Colombia,
el beneficio de la utilizaci&oacute;n de Sistema Generalizado
de Preferencias es mayor, gracias a que gran parte de sus exportaciones
son productos semimanufacturados y competitivos en el mercado
internacional. </P>
<P>
Asimismo, y siempre dentro del &aacute;mbito de la nueva pol&iacute;tica
de cooperaci&oacute;n iniciada por la Uni&oacute;n Europea con
los pa&iacute;ses en v&iacute;as de desarrollo, se aprecia que
la lucha contra la producci&oacute;n y el tr&aacute;fico de drogas
ha proporcionado la oportunidad de mejorar el acceso de algunos
productos al mercado comunitario; actualmente, dentro de lo que
es el campo de acci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n comercial,
el Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias se constituye en uno de
los mecanismos m&aacute;s importantes de cooperaci&oacute;n al
desarrollo, como lo refleja el Reglamento N&#186; 3211/90 (octubre
de 1990)<a href="#17">(17)</a> del Consejo, que extiende a los pa&iacute;ses miembros
del Acuerdo de Cartagena el R&eacute;gimen de Preferencias Arancelarias
Generalizadas aplicado a determinados productos de los Pa&iacute;ses
en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo Menos Avanzados (PMA), garantiz&aacute;ndose
de esta manera el acceso preferencial en materia de aranceles
y restricciones cuantitativas ha algunos productos al mercado
comunitario, al otorgarles el trato de Pa&iacute;ses Menos Avanzados
por un per&iacute;odo de cinco a&ntilde;os (1991-1995). Todo ello
se articula con la finalidad de fortalecer el intercambio comercial
con los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino, excepci&oacute;n
hecha a Venezuela, por considerarlo pa&iacute;s de mayor desarrollo
econ&oacute;mico relativo. </P>
<P>
Dentro de la renovada pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n al
desarrollo de la Uni&oacute;n Europea con los PVD, se observa
que la Uni&oacute;n se ha hecho eco de las continuas quejas planteadas
por los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino en lo que concierne
a la aplicaci&oacute;n y utilizaci&oacute;n del SGP. Prueba de
ello es que en la presente d&eacute;cada la Uni&oacute;n Europea
ha reformado su Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias. Consecuencia
de esta nueva orientaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo
de la Uni&oacute;n con los pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos, fue
la aprobaci&oacute;n por parte del Consejo de Ministros, el 19
de diciembre de 1994, de un nuevo esquema para los productos industriales
(Reglamento UE, n&#186; 3281/94), as&iacute; como tambi&eacute;n
para los productos agr&iacute;colas y pesqueros (Reglamento UE,
n&#186; 3282/94). El nuevo SGP industrial tiene un per&iacute;odo
de aplicaci&oacute;n de diez a&ntilde;os y, a efectos de su utilizaci&oacute;n,
se subdivide en fases de cuatro y tres a&ntilde;os (de 1995 a
1998, 1999 a 2001 y 2002 a 2004). </P>
<P>
Entre las reformas m&aacute;s importantes a destacar en el marco
del nuevo Sistema Generalizado de Preferencias, se observa una
ampliaci&oacute;n del tiempo de su aplicaci&oacute;n. Se pasa
de un per&iacute;odo de un a&ntilde;o a otro de tres o cuatro
a&ntilde;os, lo cual favorece indiscutiblemente una mayor estabilidad
en la utilizaci&oacute;n del sistema, cuesti&oacute;n de la cual
se quejaban reiteradamente los pa&iacute;ses que hac&iacute;an
uso del SGP. Por otro lado, se aprecia que se ampl&iacute;a el
abanico de los productos exportables; asimismo se eliminan los
l&iacute;mites cuantitativos, as&iacute; como tambi&eacute;n las
disposiciones favorables a los PMA. </P>
<P>
En lo que respecta al nuevo esquema para los productos agr&iacute;colas
y pesqueros, observamos que se prorroga de forma transitoria la
vigencia de los Reglamentos, hasta que se aplique el nuevo reglamento
del SGP agr&iacute;cola. Finalmente, otros de los aspectos a destacar
como importantes, es que se incluye a Venezuela en el beneficio
de las concesiones especiales otorgadas a los pa&iacute;ses andinos.
No olvidemos que, dada la caracter&iacute;stica de Venezuela como
pa&iacute;s de mayor desarrollo relativo de la regi&oacute;n,
quedaba excluida de los beneficios otorgados a los dem&aacute;s
pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino. </P>
<P>
Vistos, los antecedentes y la predisposici&oacute;n demostrada
por la Uni&oacute;n Europea en la renovaci&oacute;n del SGP con
los Pa&iacute;ses en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo, corresponde a
los pa&iacute;ses andinos en particular hacer mejor utilizaci&oacute;n,
as&iacute; como mayor aprovechamiento, del nuevo sistema de cooperaci&oacute;n,
benfici&aacute;ndose de la amplitud del per&iacute;odo de aplicaci&oacute;n
del mismo, dado que les permite mejorar de forma sensible el dise&ntilde;o
de las nuevas estrategias de cara a las exportaciones dirigidas
al mercado de la Uni&oacute;n Europea. </P>
<P>
<B>Los Flujos de Inversi&oacute;n</B> </P>
<P>
Al referirnos a los flujos de inversi&oacute;n extranjera en el
Grupo Andino, parece necesario citar brevemente la Decisi&oacute;n
n&#186; 24 (1970) y lo que signific&oacute; su aplicaci&oacute;n
para el proceso andino de integraci&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
Esta Decisi&oacute;n 24 es sobre todo conocida por su restrictivo
r&eacute;gimen com&uacute;n de tratamiento de los capitales extranjeros,
marcas, patentes, licencias y regal&iacute;as (royalties). El
objetivo de la Decisi&oacute;n no era otro que el de favorecer
la constituci&oacute;n de sociedades y empresas con mayor&iacute;a
de capital nacional y que, adem&aacute;s, estuvieran mayoritariamente
dirigidas por empresarios locales; por otro lado, se puede apreciar
que limitaba la reinversi&oacute;n de utilidades, fijaba topes
al porcentaje de remesas y regal&iacute;as, y consideraba que
los pa&iacute;ses andinos deb&iacute;an favorecer a los inversores
nacionales, privando de esta manera, manifiestamente discriminatoria,
el ingreso de capitales de los inversores extranjeros. </P>
<P>
Vistas las caracter&iacute;sticas de la Decisi&oacute;n n&#186;
24 y, sobre todo los resultados claramente negativos obtenidos
en la regi&oacute;n, se decidi&oacute;, por parte de los &oacute;rganos
ejecutivos del Grupo Andino, reformar el r&eacute;gimen de inversiones
extranjeras, adoptando para ello la Decisi&oacute;n n&#186; 220,
(1987), la Decisi&oacute;n n&#186; 291 y la Decisi&oacute;n n&#186;
292 (1991), con la finalidad de flexibilizar el programa de liberalizaci&oacute;n
y establecer un nuevo r&eacute;gimen para productos sensibles.
</P>
<P>
Hecha esta observaci&oacute;n, concretamente en lo que a los flujos
de inversiones extranjeras en los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo
Andino concierne, constatamos que los datos estad&iacute;sticos
son claros y contundentes, dado que reflejan un coeficiente de
inversi&oacute;n neta claramente deficitario para la regi&oacute;n<a href="#18">(18)</a>. </P>
<P>
Dado el clima desfavorable en el que se ha desarrollado el ingreso
de los flujos de inversi&oacute;n, tanto en el Grupo Andino como
en sus Pa&iacute;ses Miembros y, en su af&aacute;n de captar inversiones
y favorecer la llegada de capitales a la regi&oacute;n andina,
se vieron en la necesidad de reformar los reg&iacute;menes de
inversiones extranjeras<a href="#19">(19)</a>. Prueba de esta nueva realidad, es
la adopci&oacute;n de la Decisi&oacute;n n&#186; 220 y la Decisi&oacute;n
n&#186; 291<a href="#20">(20)</a> (con el nuevo r&eacute;gimen de tratamiento a
la inversi&oacute;n extranjera directa en el Grupo Andino); como
tambi&eacute;n, las reformas de los Programas de Modernizaci&oacute;n
Cambiaria y Comercial, que tienen por finalidad agilizar el programa
de liberalizaci&oacute;n comercial regional (Bolivia, 1987; Ecuador,
1988; Venezuela, 1989; Colombia, 1990, Per&uacute;, 1993)<a href="#21">(21)</a>.
</P>
<P>
Actualmente, por parte de la Uni&oacute;n Europea, se observa
una tendencia a intensificar la voluntad, tanto del Parlamento
Europeo como del Comit&eacute; Econ&oacute;mico y Social, de favorecer
el acceso de los pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos al instrumento
financiero de la Uni&oacute;n Europea (Banco Europeo de Inversiones-BEI).
Un ejemplo palpable de esta realidad es la reciente decisi&oacute;n
del Consejo que autoriza al BEI la concesi&oacute;n de pr&eacute;stamos
de inversiones a los pa&iacute;ses de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina,
por un total de 750 millones de ecus durante el per&iacute;odo
de tres a&ntilde;os (1993-1995)<a href="#22">(22)</a>. </P>
<P>
En este mismo contexto, el Consejo ha adoptado el Reglamento CEE
n&#186; 319/92<a href="#23">(23)</a>, relativo a la aplicaci&oacute;n, durante
un per&iacute;odo experimental, del Instrumento Financiero EC
International Investment Partners&uacute; (ECIP), destinado a
los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina, con el objetivo de
fomentar las inversiones, favoreciendo la constituci&oacute;n
de empresas joint venture dentro del &aacute;mbito de cooperaci&oacute;n
de las relaciones econ&oacute;micas Uni&oacute;n Europea-Grupo
Andino. Al efecto de favorecer la aplicaci&oacute;n de dicho instrumento,
es preciso recalcar la existencia de un convenio entre la Uni&oacute;n
Europea y la Corporaci&oacute;n Andina de Fomento (CAF), con el
fin de llevar a cabo la ejecuci&oacute;n del citado instrumento.
Dicho esto, es de esperar, que en el desarrollo de la d&eacute;cada
de los noventa y en vista de la adopci&oacute;n del nuevo reglamento
relativo a la aplicaci&oacute;n del ECIP, destinado a los pa&iacute;ses
de Am&eacute;rica Latina, Asia, Mediterr&aacute;neo y Sud&aacute;frica,
se hagan realidad los objetivos previamente establecidos<a href="#24">(24)</a>.
</P>
<P>
<a name=coo></a><h3>La cooperaci&#243;n al desarrollo</h3> </P>
<P>
Como hemos apuntado con anterioridad, la segunda parte del art&iacute;culo
est&aacute; constituida por la Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo
y la Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica Comunitaria a los pa&iacute;ses
miembros del Grupo Andino. </P>
<P>
En lo que a la pol&iacute;tica comunitaria de Cooperaci&oacute;n
al Desarrollo de los Pa&iacute;ses Miembros del Grupo Andino concierne,
es necesario mencionar previamente que hist&oacute;ricamente la
cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo con los PVD se ha caracterizado
por dos &aacute;mbitos privilegiados de actuaci&oacute;n comunitaria,
que beneficiaron fundamentalmente a los Pa&iacute;ses ACP (Asia-Caribe-Pac&iacute;fico,
pa&iacute;ses firmantes del Convenio de Lom&eacute;-UE) y Pa&iacute;ses
Mediterr&aacute;neos. La cooperaci&oacute;n comunitaria con los
PVD de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina se aplica tan s&oacute;lo
desde 1976<a href="#25">(25)</a>. </P>
<P>
Los mecanismos de cooperaci&oacute;n con los PVD de Asia y Am&eacute;rica
Latina se dividen en tres &aacute;reas que son, la Ayuda Humanitaria,
las Ayudas al Desarrollo y la Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica;
mecanismos que constituyen importantes actos de cooperaci&oacute;n
financiera, ya que han concentrado principalmente el desarrollo
de su actividad en los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s pobres, beneficiando
de esta manera a los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino.
Asimismo, los &uacute;ltimos balances realizados en el marco de
la cooperaci&oacute;n demuestran que las ayudas se han concedido
de acuerdo a los objetivos fijados por la Comunidad, y en gran
medida han sido dirigidas a casos espec&iacute;ficos con resultados
relativamente satisfactorios para ambas partes. </P>
<P>
Como hemos apuntado a lo largo del texto, actualmente la Uni&oacute;n
Europea ha reestructurado su pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n,
en base al Documento Orientaciones para la Cooperaci&oacute;n
con los PVD de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina, Comunicaci&oacute;n
de la Comisi&oacute;n (COM (90) 176 final de 11 de junio de 1990),
convertido posteriormente en Reglamento CEE n&#186; 443/92<a href="#26">(26)</a>.
</P>
<P>
La reestructuraci&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica comunitaria de
cooperaci&oacute;n gira en torno a dos ejes centrales que son
la Ayuda al Desarrollo y la Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica,
y est&aacute; dotada de sus respectivos instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n
dentro de un objetivo financiero plurianual que corresponde al
per&iacute;odo de los a&ntilde;os 1991-1995. </P>
<P>
Al analizar la Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo de la Uni&oacute;n
Europea con los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena,
se observa que los objetivos de la Uni&oacute;n Europea han querido
responder a las necesidades de las capas m&aacute;s desfavorecidas
y, en su mayor&iacute;a, las medidas han estado dirigidas al sector
rural y agr&iacute;cola, por ser &eacute;sta una de las &aacute;reas
m&aacute;s castigadas de la regi&oacute;n andina. </P>
<P>
<B>La Ayuda al Desarrollo</B> </P>
<P>
Como se ha indicado en el texto, la Uni&oacute;n Europea ha reestructurado
su pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n con los Pa&iacute;ses
en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo de Am&eacute;rica Latina (PVD-ALA);
actualmente, &eacute;sta gira en base a dos ejes principales que
son, la Ayuda al Desarrollo y la Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica.
</P>
<P>
La Ayuda al Desarrollo constituye la parte m&aacute;s importante
de la cooperaci&oacute;n financiera con los pa&iacute;ses miembros
del Acuerdo de Cartagena, e incluye las partidas de Ayuda Alimentaria
Normal, la Cooperaci&oacute;n Financiera y T&eacute;cnica, el
STABEX/PMA (Sistema de Estabilizaci&oacute;n de los Ingresos que
Provienen de las Exportaciones) y la cofinanciaci&oacute;n de
microproyectos en cooperaci&oacute;n con las Organizaciones No
Gubernamentales (ONG). </P>
<P>
Dentro del eje de la Ayuda al Desarrollo se encuentra la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Financiera y T&eacute;cnica con los Pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica
Latina, abarcando principalmente a los pa&iacute;ses miembros
del Grupo Andino. Dicha cooperaci&oacute;n es poco satisfactoria
tanto en cuanto a los objetivos de acci&oacute;n comunitaria,
como a las necesidades de desarrollo de los Pa&iacute;ses Andinos;
asimismo, se observa que los compromisos de cr&eacute;ditos destinados
por la Uni&oacute;n Europea a los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios
son realmente peque&ntilde;os e insuficientes<a href="#27">(27)</a> y que adem&aacute;s,
se detecta una inexistente o nula influencia de la Comisi&oacute;n
en las pol&iacute;ticas sectoriales de los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios,
lo cual se constituye en una acci&oacute;n desacertada de la ayuda
al desarrollo. </P>
<P>
En lo que concierne a los proyectos en ejecuci&oacute;n, se observa
en general un grado de aplicaci&oacute;n relativamente satisfactorio,
aunque existen &aacute;reas que deben ser sustancialmente mejoradas,
como es el caso de la planificaci&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
Otro de los grandes problemas que inciden negativamente en la
ejecuci&oacute;n de los proyectos es el retraso constatado en
los desembolsos de los medios financieros; todo ello como consecuencia
de la burocracia del sistema administrativo comunitario y de sus
circuitos de canalizaci&oacute;n en la entrega de los cr&eacute;ditos.
Por lo tanto, debe constituir para la Uni&oacute;n Europea un
aspecto prioritario de acci&oacute;n la b&uacute;squeda de una
manera adecuada y eficaz para reducir los plazos de pagos de la
Comisi&oacute;n. Dentro del contexto de la ayuda al desarrollo
se observa que los proyectos que tienen un marco pol&iacute;tico
amplio de ejecuci&oacute;n tienen mayores perspectivas de &eacute;xito;
como tambi&eacute;n, que la Comisi&oacute;n debe ser pragm&aacute;tica
y coherente con la capacidad econ&oacute;mica de los Estados beneficiarios
a la hora de ejecutar sus c&aacute;lculos y previsiones en el
momento de depositar sus fondos de contrapartida en la cofinanciaci&oacute;n
de los proyectos, dado que gran parte de los programas en ejecuci&oacute;n
quedan truncados y posteriormente abandonados, convirti&eacute;ndose
en un fracaso en el objetivo final de la cooperaci&oacute;n comunitaria.
</P>
<P>
<B>La Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica</B> </P>
<P>
La Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica de la Uni&oacute;n Europea
con los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino, es un &aacute;rea
poco privilegiada por parte de la Comunidad, si la contrastamos
con la cooperaci&oacute;n realizada con los pa&iacute;ses ACP
o Mediterr&aacute;neos; tanto a lo que a la dotaci&oacute;n financiera
se refiere, como a la escasa e insuficiente informaci&oacute;n
que existe sobre la materia, si se compara con el abundante material
existente sobre la ayuda al desarrollo, que es vasta y rica. Esta
apreciable escasez de informaci&oacute;n se debe principalmente
a la dispersi&oacute;n de la misma, dado que varios de los instrumentos
que en ella se incluyen son competencia de otras direcciones generales
de la Comisi&oacute;n y, tambi&eacute;n, porque la aplicaci&oacute;n
que se ha hecho de los diversos instrumentos que la componen ha
sido escasa; urge pues la necesidad de una acci&oacute;n de mayor
coordinaci&oacute;n y control por parte de la Uni&oacute;n Europea
en el presente tema. </P>
<P>
En lo que a la finalidad de la Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica
respecta, observamos que el objetivo de &eacute;sta, no es otro
que la transferencia de tecnolog&iacute;a y de experiencia en
las diferentes &aacute;reas sociales y econ&oacute;micas. Prueba
de ello es que la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica incluye
entre sus principales instrumentos, la cooperaci&oacute;n ecol&oacute;gica
industrial, los intercambios intrarregionales, las instituciones
regionales, las pol&iacute;ticas regionales, la comunicaci&oacute;n,
la investigaci&oacute;n, la formaci&oacute;n y la cooperaci&oacute;n
en materia energ&eacute;tica y industrial. Asimismo, los objetivos
y las normas de gesti&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
se encuentran establecidos en el Reglamento CEE n&#186; 443/92,
relativo a la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica con los PVD
de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina<a href="#28">(28)</a>. </P>
<P>
Por otro lado, es necesario mencionar que la cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica se puso en pr&aacute;ctica en el per&iacute;odo
de 1980, y es a partir del ejercicio 1988 cuando absorbe anualmente
alrededor de 35 millones de ecu del Presupuesto General Comunitario<a href="#29">(29)</a>.
En resumen, la finalidad de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
es crear un clima de confianza para ayudar a los pa&iacute;ses
en la aplicaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;ticas macroecon&oacute;micas
y estructurales de apertura a los intercambios comerciales y a
la inversi&oacute;n, que tengan un efecto de arrastre e incentivo
en el sector privado, que favorezca el desarrollo sostenido de
los Pa&iacute;ses en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo. </P>
<P>
<a name=obs></a><h3>Observaciones finales</h3> </P>
<P>
Como corolario de las observaciones finales, debemos se&ntilde;alar
que en la d&eacute;cada de los noventa la Uni&oacute;n Europea,
con la reestructuraci&oacute;n de su pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n
al desarrollo, apoyada en el Reglamento CEE n&#186; 443/92 de
febrero de 1992, relativo a la Ayuda Financiera y T&eacute;cnica
y a la Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica con los Pa&iacute;ses
en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo de Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia,
as&iacute; como tambi&eacute;n con la comunicaci&oacute;n de la
Comisi&oacute;n al Consejo y al Parlamento Europeo Uni&oacute;n
Europea-Am&eacute;rica Latina: Actualidad y perspectivas del fortalecimiento
de la Asociaci&oacute;n 1996-2000 (COM (95) 495), ha demostrado
que tiene la voluntad de que la ayuda a la cooperaci&oacute;n
del desarrollo cumpla sus objetivos de innovaci&oacute;n y ampliaci&oacute;n
del campo de acci&oacute;n en la cooperaci&oacute;n, diversificando
el conjunto de los instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo,
aumentando los medios financieros y estableciendo un programa
plurianual de cinco a&ntilde;os de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
y financiera y t&eacute;cnica (1991-1995 dotado con un total de
2.750 millones de ecu)<a href="#30">(30)</a>. </P>
<P>
Es de esperar que la Uni&oacute;n Europea, al dotarse de este
nuevo Reglamento, subsane en gran medida los problemas de discriminaci&oacute;n
que se le atribuyen en perjuicio de la ayuda a la cooperaci&oacute;n
con los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina y los pa&iacute;ses
andinos, sobre todo al considerarse &eacute;stos seriamente perjudicados
en sus relaciones econ&oacute;micas y comerciales con la UE. Asimismo,
se espera que en el futuro las relaciones de la Comunidad con
los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena se vean claramente
reforzadas, beneficiando a los intereses tanto Comunitarios como
de los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Grupo Andino. </P>
<P>
A pesar de las observaciones y cr&iacute;ticas realizadas al contexto
general de la cooperaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad con los pa&iacute;ses
miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena, se considera que la cooperaci&oacute;n
es relativamente satisfactoria, con la salvedad de que en el futuro
tiene que ampliarse a&uacute;n m&aacute;s y en especial en el
sector de las inversiones, dado que los pa&iacute;ses miembros
del Grupo Andino se encuentran en una fase de reactivaci&oacute;n
de sus econom&iacute;as y est&aacute;n &aacute;vidos de recursos
financieros. </P>
<P>
Otra de las observaciones a considerar como v&aacute;lidas es
que, dado que la ayuda se aplica a proyectos financiados y realizados
de forma conjunta, se aprecia que se interconectan por una parte
la asistencia t&eacute;cnica europea y por otra las prestaciones
otorgadas por los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios, sea a nivel t&eacute;cnico
administrativo o de mano de obra campesina. Los resultados de
esta simbiosis son procesos de di&aacute;logo y actos fruct&iacute;feros
que pueden beneficiar a ambas partes. </P>
<P>
Finalmente, otro de los aspectos a destacar es la creaci&oacute;n
de la Delegaci&oacute;n de la Comisi&oacute;n en Lima<a href="#31">(31)</a>, que
podr&aacute; solucionar de forma significativa los problemas que
se derivan como consecuencia de las distancias con respecto al
seguimiento de los proyectos en ejecuci&oacute;n; as&iacute; como
la firma del nuevo acuerdo-marco de cooperaci&oacute;n entre la
UE Europea y el Acuerdo de Cartagena y sus Pa&iacute;ses miembros<a href="#32">(32)</a>, que debe contribuir al fortalecimiento de los v&iacute;nculos
comerciales, econ&oacute;micos y de cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo
de ambas regiones. </P>
<P>
Para concluir la cooperaci&oacute;n de la Uni&oacute;n Europea
con los pa&iacute;ses miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena se justifica
por las siguientes razones: </P>
<P>
- la posibilidad de contar con mercados m&aacute;s amplios para
sus propios productos manufacturados, bienes de capital y servicio
y especialmente en asistencia tecnol&oacute;gica. (Dado que el
Grupo Andino cuenta con una poblaci&oacute;n de aproximadamente
100 millones de habitantes de un futuro potencial consumidor);
</P>
<P>
-la posibilidad de importar de los pa&iacute;ses miembros del
Grupo Andino, hidrocarburos, minerales y energ&iacute;a, para
contrarrestar la dependencia de &ccedil;frica y Oriente Medio.
( La regi&oacute;n Andina posee en su subsuelo la segunda reserva
mundial de hidrocarburos y minerales) y, </P>
<P>
- la posibilidad de utilizar a Espa&ntilde;a y a los pa&iacute;ses
sensibles con la regi&oacute;n, como hilo conductor en la nueva
pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n comunitaria hacia Latinoam&eacute;rica.
(Vali&eacute;ndose de los lazos hist&oacute;ricos y culturales).

<A NAME="abs"><h3>Abstract:</h3><P></A>
<H3>Euro-latinamerican relations and the process of european regional
integration</H3>
<P>
The evolution of the relations between the current European Union
and Latin America is framed within the complex system of policies
and instruments which allowed the Community to gain access to
its present status in the international context and which serve
as a reference in the attempt to advance in the process of rapprochement.
The limits of the Community powers in foreign policy and its regional
focus are some key elements which condition any advance in the
field of future prospection.
<P>

<a name=int><h3>Introducci&#243;n</h3>
<b>Una perspectiva europea</b> </P>
<P>
En el mar de flujos y reflujos del reciente devenir hist&oacute;rico
en las relaciones euro-latinoam&eacute;ricanas, la construcci&oacute;n
de la integraci&oacute;n europea constituye una marea de fondo
que ha dominado el di&aacute;logo. La evoluci&oacute;n de estos
contactos queda necesariamente enmarcada en el complejo de pol&iacute;ticas
e instrumentos que permitieron a la Comunidad Europea (CE) acceder
a su actual estatuto en el contexto internacional. </P>
<P>
La pol&iacute;tica exterior de la CE, como su misma construcci&oacute;n,
se ciment&oacute; sobre dos pilares: la cesi&oacute;n de competencias
estables por medio de Acuerdos Internacionales y la cl&aacute;usula
evolutiva, que permite una progresiva asunci&oacute;n de competencias
en la medida necesaria para una &oacute;ptima consecuci&oacute;n
de los objetivos del Tratado fundacional. Surgi&oacute; as&iacute;
una correlaci&oacute;n entre el fundamento jur&iacute;dico de
las competencias comunitarias y la extensi&oacute;n material de
&eacute;stas(Groux/Manin,1985) y aqu&eacute;l condicion&oacute;
los instrumentos utilizados para formalizar una determinada obligaci&oacute;n
internacional, de modo que observar los instrumentos jur&iacute;dicos
empleados en las relaciones con Am&eacute;rica Latina (AL) sirve
de prospecci&oacute;n sobre el grado de profundizaci&oacute;n
adquirido. </P>
<P>
Adicionalmente y al paso de sucesivas ampliaciones, la Comunidad
instituy&oacute; unos esquemas de relaci&oacute;n regional selectivos
en funci&oacute;n de prioridades consensuadas por el conjunto
de Estados miembros. Entre los pa&iacute;ses en v&iacute;as de
desarrollo (PVD), AL atrajo inicialmente s&oacute;lo un modesto
inter&eacute;s respecto al de las antiguas colonias de los pa&iacute;ses
miembros y tampoco pod&iacute;a competir con las perspectivas
comerciales de los pa&iacute;ses industrializados o las expectativas
m&aacute;s recientes de la Europa del Este y el Magreb. Este papel
secundario plane&oacute; incluso en los escogidos momentos de
entendimiento posteriores. </P>
<P>
Para hacer un an&aacute;lisis global en perspectiva hist&oacute;rica,
recurrimos a una doble estructuraci&oacute;n de las relaciones.
En corte vertical se distinguen tres &aacute;mbitos materiales:
el pol&iacute;tico-diplom&aacute;tico, las relaciones econ&oacute;mico-comerciales
y la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo, con evoluciones diversas
pero relacionadas entre s&iacute;, de manera que de la comparaci&oacute;n
se pueden destilar las principales tendencias. En horizontal se
establece una divisi&oacute;n en per&iacute;odos que tiene en
cuenta la progresividad de la pol&iacute;tica exterior de la Comunidad,
pues cualquier intento de periodizar ha de enmarcarse en dicho
proceso de ensanchamiento material paulatino y constre&ntilde;irse
a los instrumentos disponibles. </P>
<P>
<a name =1958></a><h3>1958-70: El per&#237;odo inicial de la construcci&#243;n europea</h3> </P>
<P>
La debutante Comunidad Econ&oacute;mica Europea (CEE) estaba en
fase de afianzamiento como actor de las relaciones internacionales
y carec&iacute;a de instrumentos jur&iacute;dicos para la institucionalizaci&oacute;n
del di&aacute;logo con AL, limit&aacute;ndose los contactos a
simples reuniones protocolarias entre embajadores o altos funcionarios,
sin capacidad para modificar la situaci&oacute;n mientras persistiesen
las inc&oacute;gnitas a la hora de designar un interlocutor v&aacute;lido.
</P>
<P>
<B>Los primeros contactos</B> </P>
<P>
En los a&ntilde;os iniciales se produjeron incipientes declaraciones
en favor del establecimiento de mejores relaciones, como el primer
<I>Memor&aacute;ndum sobre las relaciones con Am&eacute;rica Latina</I>
de mayo de 1958, que invitaba a una colaboraci&oacute;n fundada
en el respeto de los derechos de cada una de las dos partes interesadas
y sobre la base de ventajas rec&iacute;procas. En enero de 1963
se consider&oacute; aplicar ciertas reducciones en la tarifa aduanera
com&uacute;n frente a productos latinoamericanos en atenci&oacute;n
a su condici&oacute;n de PVD y posibles modalidades de ayuda al
desarrollo, lo cual fu&eacute; fruto de la asistencia de la Comisi&oacute;n
a la Conferencia de Punta del Este, donde los dirigentes latinoamericanos
discut&iacute;an sus estrategias frente al mercado internacional.
Como resultado, el Consejo cre&oacute; un grupo de contacto con
competencias limitadas, que exclu&iacute;an expresamente la negociaci&oacute;n
y se circunscrib&iacute;an al intercambio de informaciones. </P>
<P>
Tras un lustro de est&eacute;riles reuniones informativas, el
Gobierno italiano entreg&oacute; al Consejo un memor&aacute;ndum
que auspiciaba la creaci&oacute;n de una comisi&oacute;n de contacto
de car&aacute;cter permanente y el establecimiento de un mecanismo
de coordinaci&oacute;n de las acciones de los Estados miembros
en el campo de la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica y de la integraci&oacute;n
regional. Aunque el Consejo lleg&oacute; a proponer la creaci&oacute;n
de una comisi&oacute;n mixta, &eacute;sta no llegar&iacute;a a
concretarse, por el cansancio derivado de la ausencia de resultados
concretos, suma de la falta de interlocutor estable por parte
latinoamericana y la precariedad temporal de los contactos causada
por el sistema de autorizaciones limitadas del Consejo. </P>
<P>
Durante estos a&ntilde;os las relaciones ni tan siquiera deber&iacute;an
calificarse de multilaterales ya que, mientras los pa&iacute;ses
de AL trataban de conseguir un di&aacute;logo directo con los
Estados miembros, &eacute;ste era evitado tanto por &eacute;stos,
para impedir cualquier viso de negociaci&oacute;n con consecuencias
jur&iacute;dicas, como por la comisi&oacute;n, que buscaba reforzar
su representatividad en la arena internacional (Marchisio, 1983).

<P>
<B>El establecimiento del mercado com&uacute;n</B> </P>
<P>
Al ser las pol&iacute;ticas comercial y econ&oacute;mica las competencias
m&aacute;s tempranamente transferidas de forma exclusiva a la
Comunidad, Latinoam&eacute;rica expres&oacute; r&aacute;pidamente
sus inquietudes sobre los perjuicios que pudieran derivarse de
la implantaci&oacute;n de una tarifa aduanera com&uacute;n para
sus exportaciones ya que, en lo inmediato, supon&iacute;a una
merma en su capacidad de negociaci&oacute;n bilateral para mantener
sus mercados tradicionales en cada pa&iacute;s miembro de la CEE,
implicando enfrentarse a la disciplina de consenso que impone
el proceso de toma de decisiones comunitario. Pero los mayores
recelos eran frente al blindaje del mercado europeo que supon&iacute;a
el establecimiento de la Pol&iacute;tica Agraria Com&uacute;n
(PAC) (Grilli,1993). </P>
<P>
En ausencia de acuerdos comerciales bilaterales, los intercambios
mercantiles se regularon en los foros multilaterales, tanto en
la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas para el Comercio y el Desarrollo
(UNCTAD) como en el Acuerdo General sobre Aranceles y comercio
(GATT). Durante los debates surgidos a ra&iacute;z de las propuestas
comerciales lanzadas por los PVD a trav&eacute;s del Grupo de
los 77, la CEE, aunque se manifest&oacute; en favor de la estabilizaci&oacute;n
de los precios de los productos b&aacute;sicos, acab&oacute; decant&aacute;ndose
por la negociaci&oacute;n de materias primas producto por producto,
estableciendo distintos grados de liberalizaci&oacute;n y distintos
plazos. Tras la aprobaci&oacute;n en diciembre de 1964 del nuevo
cap&iacute;tulo IV del GATT <I>Comercio y Desarrollo</I>, que
establec&iacute;a los principios de estabilizacion de los precios
de los productos b&aacute;sicos, la no reciprocidad en las concesiones
a los PVD y el mantenimiento del statu quo en las tarifas vigentes,
el Consejo acord&oacute; suspender total o parcialmente de forma
unilateral, la tarifa aduanera com&uacute;n de determinados productos,
entre los que se encontraban algunos de inter&eacute;s para AL.
</P>
<P>
La ausencia de resultados obtenidos por v&iacute;a interregional
y los avatares que azotaban los intentos de consolidaci&oacute;n
de los sistemas de integraci&oacute;n latinoamericanos, inclin&oacute;
a los pa&iacute;ses con mayor potencial econ&oacute;mico (Argentina,
Brasil y Uruguay) a hacer uso de su iniciativa individual para
defender sus intereses en el seno del GATT, postura insolidaria
que a la larga debilitar&iacute;a su posici&oacute;n negociadora
global. </P>
<P>
<B>Primeros pasos de la Cooperaci&oacute;n para el Desarrollo</B>
</P>
<P>
Las competencias limitadas de la CEE determinaron una relaci&oacute;n
con los PVD en una doble vertiente: la participaci&oacute;n de
la Comunidad en el contexto general de la cooperaci&oacute;n para
el desarrollo, y la relativa al sistema de cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo establecida en el marco de la CEE, que en esta
primera etapa qued&oacute; circunscrita a la inclusi&oacute;n
en el Tratado CEE (TCEE) del acuerdo de asociaci&oacute;n para
las ex colonias y a la participaci&oacute;n en la Primera Convenci&oacute;n
sobre Ayuda Alimentaria de 1967. </P>

<P>
La adhesi&oacute;n de Dinamarca, Irlanda y el Reino Unido abri&oacute;
el debate, hasta entonces obviado por influencia francesa, sobre
las relaciones externas de la Comunidad, centr&aacute;ndolo en
la propuesta brit&aacute;nica de globalizar la pol&iacute;tica
de cooperaci&oacute;n con los PVD que concern&iacute;a a la ubicaci&oacute;n
de la Comunidad en el mundo. Esta preocupaci&oacute;n qued&oacute;
recogida en las Actas de la Cumbre de 1972 en Par&iacute;s, que
inaugur&oacute; la <I>dimensi&oacute;n mundialista </I>de la cooperaci&oacute;n
para sintonizar el aumento de la influencia de la CEE tras la
ampliaci&oacute;n con su presencia internacional. </P>
<P>
<B>La b&uacute;squeda del interlocutor regional</B> </P>
<P>
Tras el fracaso del primer di&aacute;logo, los pa&iacute;ses de
la Comisi&oacute;n Especial de Coordinaci&oacute;n Latinoamericana
(CECLA) trataron de definir una pol&iacute;tica com&uacute;n resumida
en la <I>Declaraci&oacute;n de Buenos Aires</I> de 1970 con la
que se propuso oficialmente a la comisi&oacute;n la institucionalizaci&oacute;n
del di&aacute;logo. &#131;sta inst&oacute; al Consejo a convocar
una conferencia interministerial que acab&oacute; reducida a una
reuni&oacute;n entre los embajadores de AL, la comisi&oacute;n
y el comit&eacute; de representantes permanentes de los Estados
miembros de la CEE (COREPER). </P>
<P>
La primera declaraci&oacute;n com&uacute;n defini&oacute; las
l&iacute;neas directrices de la negociaci&oacute;n priorizando
la b&uacute;squeda de soluciones a los problemas comerciales con
f&oacute;rmulas preferenciales para aumentar y diversificar los
intercambios. Estas reuniones continuaron con periodicidad irregular
hasta 1979, a&ntilde;o en que se interrumpieron por la incorporaci&oacute;n
de Cuba al Grupo Latinoam&eacute;ricano de embajadores ante la
CEE (GRULA). </P>
<P>
En 1976 se cre&oacute; el Sistema Econ&oacute;mico Latinoamericano
(SELA), uno de cuyos objetivos era la coordinaci&oacute;n de la
posici&oacute;n de sus miembros en los c&iacute;rculos internacionales.
El SELA mantuvo posturas combativas frente a la pol&iacute;tica
comercial comunitaria y lleg&oacute; a plantear la necesidad de
arbitrar medidas coordinadas de <I>tratamiento sim&eacute;trico</I>
al proteccionismo que aplicaba la CEE. </P>
<P>
Abriendo v&iacute;as de acercamiento, Bogot&aacute; vio nacer
en 1974 las Conferencias entre representantes del Parlamento Europeo
(PE) y parlamentarios de los Estados latinoamericanos. &#131;stas
continuaron celebr&aacute;ndose bianualmente y aunque su trascendencia
pr&aacute;ctica fue escasa, debido al limitado poder de decisi&oacute;n
de la instituci&oacute;n parlamentaria europea, sirvieron para
despertar una sensibilidad favorable a los problemas latinoam&eacute;ricanos
especialmente entre fuerzas pol&iacute;ticas afines. </P>
<P>
<B>Acuerdos, preferencias y restricciones comerciales</B> </P>
<P>
Los cuatro primeros acuerdos comerciales bilaterales firmados
entre la CEE y pa&iacute;ses de AL se negociaron durante el primer
lustro de la d&eacute;cada: el primero con Argentina en 1971 y
dos a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s tarde con Uruguay, s&oacute;lo cuatro
meses antes que el celebrado con Brasil en 1974. Estos tres acuerdos
tienen casi id&eacute;ntico contenido, limitado a las materias
previstas expresamente en los art&iacute;culos 111 y 113 del TCEE.
El cuarto, firmado con M&eacute;xico en julio de 1975, anunciaba
un nuevo tipo de convenio m&aacute;s ambicioso, dirigido al conjunto
de pa&iacute;ses no asociados que a pesar de no ofrecer cambios
cualitativos de contenido material, s&iacute; mejoraba aspectos
institucionales. Se trataba de acuerdos no preferenciales con
el tratamiento de la naci&oacute;n m&aacute;s favorecida, regla
general del GATT que disfrutan todos sus miembros. </P>
<P>
Dado el escaso alcance de los acuerdos, la regulaci&oacute;n multilateral
continu&oacute; siendo la base principal de las transacciones
comerciales, aunque matizada por la condici&oacute;n de PVD de
las econom&iacute;as latinoamericanas y las pol&iacute;ticas proteccionistas.
En noviembre de 1970, en respuesta a la <I>Declaraci&oacute;n
de Buenos Aires</I>, el Consejo aprob&oacute; un reglamento acelerando
algunas concesiones resultantes de las negociaciones de la Ronda
Kenedy y, posteriormente, las negociaciones de la Ronda Tokio
(1974-1979) consiguieron algunos progresos. Al mismo tiempo, siete
pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos optaron por negociar <I>acuerdos
de autolimitaci&oacute;n voluntaria</I> del textil en lugar de
coordinar sus posiciones; con la crisis del sector sider&uacute;rgico
se lleg&oacute; a nuevos acuerdos de autolimitaci&oacute;n, inducidos
por la Comunidad mediante un uso muy severo de la regulaci&oacute;n
<I>antidumping</I> y antisubvenciones, y siguieron las limitaciones
en los productos artesanos e incluso materias primas como carne
de cordero y cabra o la mandioca. Al no tratar de contribuir al
incremento de los intercambios sino de restringirlos, estos acuerdos
se planteaban como una medida provisional y transitoria, pero
con tendencia a la perpetuaci&oacute;n en la pr&aacute;ctica a
trav&eacute;s de sucesivas reconducciones y con el agravante de
que se aplicaban frente a cualquier competidor sin considerar
su nivel de desarrollo. </P>
<P>
En sentido opuesto, la Comunidad puso en vigor, a partir de julio
de 1971, el Sistema de Preferencias Generalizadas (SPG), con objeto
de permitir un aumento de los ingresos por importaci&oacute;n
de los PVD y el fortalecimiento de su industria, tal y como hab&iacute;a
sido recomendado por la UNCTAD. Con el tiempo se constat&oacute;
que los PVD de mayor desarrollo eran los que m&aacute;s aprovechaban
el sistema; Brasil, M&eacute;xico y Argentina eran los &uacute;nicos
pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos que figuraban entre los 10 principales
beneficiarios. La burocratizaci&oacute;n, la poca transparencia
y la falta de previsibilidad del sistema dificult&oacute; su aplicaci&oacute;n.
</P>
<P>
<B>La globalizaci&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n</B>
</P>
<P>
El cambio fundamental fue la evoluci&oacute;n desde un concepto
de cooperaci&oacute;n estrechamente ligado a la relaci&oacute;n
postcolonial, hacia un campo m&aacute;s amplio, inserto en el
&aacute;mbito de las relaciones exteriores de la propia Comunidad
(Abell&aacute;n,1992). A las pol&iacute;ticas regionales ya iniciadas
con los pa&iacute;ses de &ccedil;frica-Caribe-Pac&iacute;fico
(ACP) y de la Cuenca Mediterr&aacute;nea, se a&ntilde;adieron
dos instrumentos dirigidos a los PVD en general e inspirados en
el surgimiento de una Pol&iacute;tica de Cooperaci&oacute;n comunitaria.
</P>
<P>
La evoluci&oacute;n qued&oacute; dibujada en una serie de documentos
program&aacute;ticos; previamente a la ampliaci&oacute;n, la Comisi&oacute;n
envi&oacute; al Consejo las <I>Orientaciones de una pol&iacute;tica
de Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo </I>seguidas del Programa
de Acci&oacute;n donde se evidencia la <I>doble orientaci&oacute;n</I>
(Sobrino, J.M., 1985) de la Pol&iacute;tica de Cooperaci&oacute;n
comunitaria. Debido a la escasez de medios disponibles se manten&iacute;a
la regionalizaci&oacute;n selectiva, pero completada mediante
acciones en el &aacute;mbito mundial con PVD no asociados, siguiendo
las recomendaciones de la UNCTAD y la Asamblea General de la ONU.
</P>
<P>
El Primer programa de acci&oacute;n en favor de los PVD no asociados
para el per&iacute;odo 1976-1980 se estableci&oacute; gracias
a las presiones ejercidas por Reino Unido, que bloque&oacute;
la aprobaci&oacute;n de las cantidades de ayuda dirigidas a los
pa&iacute;ses ACP hasta que no se decidiese esta aportaci&oacute;n.
Se trataba de ayudas no reembolsables destinadas a los pa&iacute;ses
m&aacute;s necesitados, con un enfoque de car&aacute;cter asistencial
dirigido al aumento de la producci&oacute;n alimentaria y a potenciar
el desarrollo de las regiones rurales. La distribuci&oacute;n
fu&eacute; de un 75% para Asia, un 20% para Am&eacute;rica Latina
y un 5% para pa&iacute;ses africanos no asociados. </P>
<P>
La crisis alimentaria mundial a principios de los setenta provoc&oacute;
un aumento de los precios de los cereales en el mercado mundial
y estimul&oacute; un r&aacute;pido crecimiento del presupuesto
dedicado a ayuda alimentaria. La ayuda comunitaria se dividi&oacute;
en dos: la ayuda de urgencia para paliar situaciones cr&iacute;ticas
y la ayuda alimentaria normal. En 1971 se cre&oacute; un segundo
fondo para la ayuda de emergencia a los pa&iacute;ses no cubiertos
por el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo (FED), al que en 1972 se a&ntilde;adir&iacute;a
un fondo de ayuda alimentaria de emergencia para v&iacute;ctimas
de desastres y grupos vulnerables en los PVD. La participaci&oacute;n
de AL en la ayuda de emergencia s&oacute;lo fue de un 10%, dada
su mejor situaci&oacute;n respecto a Asia y &ccedil;frica. En
cambio, su participaci&oacute;n en la l&iacute;nea presupuestar&iacute;a
de ayuda a trav&eacute;s de Organizaciones No Gubernamentales
(ONG), que se inici&oacute; a partir de 1976, fue en torno al
25% del total debido a la amplia cultura occidental existente
en Latinoam&eacute;rica, que facilita el contacto directo de la
poblaci&oacute;n civil, y el hecho de trabajar con las clases
m&aacute;s desfavorecidas, que deja al margen los &iacute;ndices
macroecon&oacute;micos (Granda-Mate-Moreno, 1988). </P>
<P>
En general, durante toda esta d&eacute;cada, la participaci&oacute;n
de la regi&oacute;n latinoamericana en la Cooperaci&oacute;n de
la CEE fue muy reducida, en un promedio del 2,7% entre 1970 y
1977, pero aument&oacute; a partir del agudizamiento de la crisis
de Centroam&eacute;rica (CA) que condujo a un aumento de los recursos
enviados a dicha subregi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>
Una crisis econ&oacute;mica generalizada, acompa&ntilde;ada de
sucesivas crisis pol&iacute;ticas, condicionaron las relaciones
interregionales tambi&eacute;n matizadas por dos acontecimientos
trascendentales del proceso de integraci&oacute;n europea. La
adhesi&oacute;n de Portugal y Espa&ntilde;a puso sobre la mesa
negociadora sus especiales relaciones con Latinoam&eacute;rica.
En el discurso pol&iacute;tico del momento, Espa&ntilde;a alent&oacute;
su papel de <I>puente</I> para atribuirse el peso de una potencia
media en el campo diplom&aacute;tico (Pi&ntilde;ol, 1993), ya
que en el econ&oacute;mico su situaci&oacute;n era bastante deficiente.
Fue secundada por algunos l&iacute;deres latinoamericanos que
anhelaban aumentar su influencia en el seno de la Comunidad, pero
ello despert&oacute; reticencias en las potencias medias con vocaci&oacute;n
de liderazgo como Argentina, Brasil o M&eacute;xico, que tacharon
de paternalistas algunas actitudes del Gobierno espa&ntilde;ol
(Rosenwig,1987), y en las dos grandes potencias coloniales europeas,
Francia y Reino Unido, que ve&iacute;an peligrar los privilegios
de sus zonas de influencia al ser diluidos entre un n&uacute;mero
demasiado extenso de pa&iacute;ses. </P>
<P>
La firma en febrero de 1986 del Acta &ograve;nica Europea (AUE),
para dinamizar el proceso de profundizaci&oacute;n en la construcci&oacute;n
europea, formaliz&oacute; la Cooperaci&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica
Europea (CPE) mediante un acuerdo entre los Estados miembros sobre
materias fuera del alcance de las competencias comunitarias para
formular y aplicar conjuntamente una pol&iacute;tica exterior
europea. Paulatinamente, la Comunidad abandon&oacute; la anterior
pol&iacute;tica inhibicionista sobre AL y tom&oacute; posturas
m&aacute;s comprometidas, como fruto del previo debate interno
sobre el alcance de la CPE (Ifestos, P., 1987). </P>

<B>Di&aacute;logo e intervenci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica</B> </P>
<P>
Dejando de lado las diferencias provocadas por la crisis de la
guerra de las Malvinas, la intervenci&oacute;n m&aacute;s relevante
de la Comunidad en la regi&oacute;n fue su actuaci&oacute;n en
el conflicto centroam&eacute;ricano, que tuvo diferente cariz
al tratarse de una acci&oacute;n diplom&aacute;tica en favor de
una soluci&oacute;n negociada entre los pa&iacute;ses de la regi&oacute;n.
Su actitud en favor de las iniciativas locales, materializadas
en el Plan de Contadora, la distanci&oacute; de la postura intervencionista
de los Estados Unidos, con quien evitando un enfrentamiento abierto,
mantuvo una diferencia conceptual sobre la naturaleza del conflicto.
</P>
<P>
El Consejo Europeo del 29 de marzo de 1982 adopt&oacute; la primera
Declaraci&oacute;n favorable a las iniciativas de di&aacute;logo
regional en aplicaci&oacute;n del principio de soberan&iacute;a
nacional y respeto a la voluntad de los pueblos, al tiempo que
identificaba como principales causas del conflicto los profundos
problemas econ&oacute;micos y la desigualdad social de la regi&oacute;n;
y el Consejo de Stuttgart de junio de 1983 formul&oacute; el <I>enfoque
europeo</I> (D&iacute;az C&oacute;rdoba, A., 1992) al tiempo que
apoyaba la iniciativa de di&aacute;logo regional surgida en Contadora.
Su respaldo cristaliz&oacute; en la convocatoria de una cumbre
de jefes de Estado de San Jos&eacute;, en septiembre de 1984,
en la que adem&aacute;s de los pa&iacute;ses del <I>Istmo</I>,
la Comunidad, sus Estados miembros y el grupo de Contadora, participaron
Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal. </P>
<P>
La conferencia present&oacute; una doble vertiente; mientras se
prestaba apoyo pol&iacute;tico al proceso de paz, se trat&oacute;
de elaborar un plan de cooperaci&oacute;n. La conferencia <I>San
Jos&eacute; II</I>, celebrada en Luxemburgo en noviembre de 1985,
institucionaliz&oacute; el di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico, condensando
el momento &aacute;lgido de implicaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica
de la Comunidad en el conflicto que declin&oacute; despu&eacute;s
en favor del proceso de ampliaci&oacute;n primero y la negociaci&oacute;n
del Acta &ograve;nica despu&eacute;s. Las relaciones languidecieron
hasta la cumbre de Guatemala en 1987, cuya acta final dedic&oacute;
numerosas alusiones a la democratizaci&oacute;n en Nicaragua.
La actitud reticente impidi&oacute; llegar a la concreci&oacute;n
de un acuerdo econ&oacute;mico, repiti&eacute;ndose la situaci&oacute;n
al a&ntilde;o siguiente en Hamburgo. La conferencia de San Pedro
Sula, en febrero de 1989, concluy&oacute; en tono pol&iacute;tico
ambiguo aunque se lleg&oacute; a un acuerdo sobre ayuda extraordinaria.
</P>
<P>
La intervenci&oacute;n en C A a&uacute;n dio frutos tard&iacute;os;
de la fusi&oacute;n del Grupo de Contadora y el Grupo de apoyo
surgi&oacute; el denominado Grupo de R&iacute;o, con el que la
Comunidad entabl&oacute; un temprano contacto ya en septiembre
de 1987. Las relaciones recibieron un golpe de tim&oacute;n a
partir de la ampliaci&oacute;n del Grupo hasta cubrir un &aacute;rea
geogr&aacute;fica id&eacute;ntica a la de la Asociaci&oacute;n
Latinoamericana de Integraci&oacute;n (ALADI) en diciembre de
1989, constituy&eacute;ndose en un foro pol&iacute;tico permanente
de concertaci&oacute;n, di&aacute;logo y fomento de la integraci&oacute;n
regional que pudo presentarse como el principal interlocutor de
la regi&oacute;n, sustituyendo a otras opciones de di&aacute;logo
general, como el SELA y el GRULA o de integraci&oacute;n regional,
como el Pacto Andino. Al situarse los di&aacute;logos subregionales
en una posici&oacute;n intermedia, mientras persist&iacute;an
problemas para el avance de las relaciones de regi&oacute;n a
regi&oacute;n, consiguieron una importancia creciente (Wilhemy,
1988) y con ello se impon&iacute;a la argumentaci&oacute;n europea
que alegaba la heterogeneidad de realidades que representan los
diferentes pa&iacute;ses del continente para recurrir a criterios
de aplicaci&oacute;n selectiva frente la ilusi&oacute;n latinoamericana
de igualdad de trato (Grabendorf, 1988). </P>
<P>
Las Conferencias Interparlamentarias CE-AL cobraron vigor a medida
que el continente latinoamericano se redemocratizaba, contribuyendo
a reforzar el parlamentarismo en la regi&oacute;n. El Parlamento
Europeo solicit&oacute; la elaboraci&oacute;n de un proyecto de
cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica, financiera y de ayuda, as&iacute;
como el restablecimiento del di&aacute;logo y denunci&oacute;
el intervencionismo de Estados Unidos. Dado que sus resoluciones
no tienen car&aacute;cter obligatorio, adopt&oacute; la t&eacute;cnica
reiterativa a modo de presi&oacute;n sobre la Comisi&oacute;n,
&oacute;rgano principal en la iniciativa legislativa, labor en
la que destacaron los representantes espa&ntilde;oles. </P>
<P>
El proceso de acercamiento fue acompa&ntilde;ado de documentaci&oacute;n
program&aacute;tica comunitaria sobre las relaciones con AL; las
<I>Orientaciones para un fortalecimiento de las relaciones con
Am&eacute;rica Central</I> de 1981 ofrecieron apoyo para profundizar
el proceso de integraci&oacute;n como medio para asegurar la estabilidad,
la prosperidad y el crecimiento de la zona ycasi tres a&ntilde;os
despu&eacute;s, tras la iniciativa del SELA para abrir el di&aacute;logo,
la comisi&oacute;n elabor&oacute; un documento que conten&iacute;a
las <I>Orientaciones para fortalecer las relaciones entre la Comunidad
Europea y Am&eacute;rica Latina</I> recogiendo algunas reivindicaciones
latinoamericanas, aunque propugnaba un uso diferenciado de los
instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n y abogaba por la distinci&oacute;n
entre el &aacute;mbito regional, subregional y bilateral. </P>
<P>
Con transcendencia m&aacute;s testimonial que pr&aacute;ctica,
el Tratado de Adhesi&oacute;n de Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal recogi&oacute;
una declaraci&oacute;n com&uacute;n de intenciones relativa al
desarrollo y la intensificaci&oacute;n de las relaciones con AL,
pero d&iacute;as m&aacute;s tarde el Consejo Europeo encarg&oacute;
a la comisi&oacute;n un documento adaptado a los objetivos de
la declaraci&oacute;n. La comunicaci&oacute;n que present&oacute;
situaba la cooperaci&oacute;n interregional en un marco de orden
pol&iacute;tico y, como programa de acci&oacute;n, propuso el
refuerzo de las l&iacute;neas de cooperaci&oacute;n abiertas diversificandolas
a &aacute;mbitos que incluyesen al sector privado, pero se estimaba
necesario incrementar el presupuesto y la presencia de la comisi&oacute;n
en AL </P>
<P>
El Consejo aprob&oacute; las <I>Nuevas orientaciones de la CEE
para las relaciones con Am&eacute;rica Latina</I>, primer documento
que trazaba una estrategia global que atendiera a la diversidad
de las situaciones y las necesidades en AL valorando los espacios
de cooperaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica y las relaciones interparlamentarias.
Aunque acept&oacute; algunas propuestas y la necesidad de una
evaluaci&oacute;n peri&oacute;dica sobre su aplicaci&oacute;n,
no se comprometi&oacute; a aumentar los fondos y as&iacute; prim&oacute;
de nuevo la intencionalidad pol&iacute;tica sobre el contenido
material, confirmando la impresi&oacute;n de distanciamiento entre
las relaciones pol&iacute;ticas y las econ&oacute;micas (Van Klaveren,
1989). </P>
<P>
Puntualmente, buen n&uacute;mero de declaraciones institucionales
se refirieron a acontecimientos pol&iacute;ticos de AL denunciando
la violaci&oacute;n de Derechos Humanos por parte de los reg&iacute;menes
autoritarios. Esta alta preocupaci&oacute;n por su cumplimiento
en la zona, mucho mayor que la que inspiraban otras regiones donde
tambi&eacute;n distaban de ser respetados, fue considerada discriminatoria
por los gobiernos afectados pero, en otro sentido, se interpret&oacute;
como reconocimiento de un sistema de valores com&uacute;n; as&iacute;,
las declaraciones que saludaban los procesos de democratizaci&oacute;n
fueron se&ntilde;aladas como un segundo factor de politizaci&oacute;n
de las relaciones (Grabendorf, 1988). </P>
<P>
<B>Aspectos de la crisis econ&oacute;mica</B> </P>
<P>
En el &aacute;mbito econ&oacute;mico, las discrepancias entre
las tres instancias que participan en el proceso legislativo comunitario
son palpables. Podemos formular una proporci&oacute;n inversa,
seg&uacute;n la cual a menor poder de decisi&oacute;n mayor generosidad
en las propuestas y, al contrario, la falta de concreci&oacute;n
de las propuestas es directamente proporcional a la capacidad
de obligarse. </P>
<P>
As&iacute; la comisi&oacute;n en las <I>Orientaciones</I> de 1984
alegaba el estrecho margen de maniobra a corto y mediano plazo
en materia comercial y afirmaba que el factor determinante de
la disminuci&oacute;n o el estancamiento de la participaci&oacute;n
relativa de las exportaciones latinoamericanas no era el proteccionismo
de la Comunidad, sino factores de car&aacute;cter estructural.
Esta postura era fuertemente contestada por el SELA, quien acusaba
a la Comunidad de bloquear el di&aacute;logo, al eludir las consecuencias
negativas que las pol&iacute;ticas comercial y agr&iacute;cola
hab&iacute;an tenido en relaci&oacute;n a AL. En cambio, el Parlamento
Europeo s&iacute; asum&iacute;a que el proteccionismo de los pa&iacute;ses
desarrollados contribuy&oacute; a dificultar la situaci&oacute;n.
</P>
<P>
Al ingreso de Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal en la Comunidad, se estableci&oacute;
un r&eacute;gimen transitorio para algunos productos y Espa&ntilde;a
incluy&oacute;, a t&iacute;tulo propio, una declaraci&oacute;n
en la que propon&iacute;a encontrar soluciones permanentes en
el marco del SPG, lo que result&oacute; dif&iacute;cil dado el
car&aacute;cter temporal y no obligatorio del esquema que permite
su retirada total o parcial. Un nuevo reglamento inici&oacute;
la reforma del SPG el 12 de diciembre de 1985 basado en la aplicaci&oacute;n
diferenciada de las preferencias, la actualizaci&oacute;n de los
l&iacute;mites, el aumento de la seguridad del acceso a las ventajas
y la simplificaci&oacute;n. La diferenciaci&oacute;n continu&oacute;
en el Reglamento 3.635/87 alegando que los pa&iacute;ses relativamente
m&aacute;s avanzados hab&iacute;an obtenido los objetivos del
sistema al aumentar su cuota de mercado y no estaba justificado
prorrogarselo. Esta aplicaci&oacute;n diferenciada, sumada al
car&aacute;cter no preferencial, era contestada por los pa&iacute;ses
de renta media que ve&iacute;an en ella una especie de sanci&oacute;n
contra el progreso (Roett,R., 1982). </P>
<P>
En la crisis de la deuda externa, la falta de competencia de la
CE y la negativa de los Estados miembros a negociar al margen
de los organismos internacionales hicieron fracasar los t&iacute;midos
intentos de mediaci&oacute;n que trat&oacute; de poner en marcha
la comisi&oacute;n con apoyo del Parlamento. </P>
<P>
<B>Un nuevo mapa de acuerdos comerciales</B> </P>
<P>
El nuevo tratado con Brasil de 1980 inaugur&oacute; la <I>segunda
generaci&oacute;n</I> de acuerdos bilaterales de cooperaci&oacute;n
que superaba los l&iacute;mites comerciales recurriendo a la base
jur&iacute;dica del art&iacute;culo 235 TCEE. Brasil, que absorb&iacute;a
m&aacute;s de un cuarto del comercio total entre la CEE y Am&eacute;rica
Latina en su conjunto, era adem&aacute;s un importante proveedor
de materias primas. Esta doble vertiente se reflej&oacute; en
los objetivos del acuerdo: abrir fuentes de aprovisionamiento
y nuevos mercados. La Comunidad se neg&oacute; a reconocer a Brasil
como PVD por temor a la competitividad de sus producciones aunque
le reconoc&iacute;a como miembro del Grupo de los 77. </P>
<P>
En diciembre de 1983 se firm&oacute; con el Grupo Andino el primer
Tratado de Cooperaci&oacute;n con una asociaci&oacute;n de integraci&oacute;n
regional latinoamericana. Eran pa&iacute;ses que individualmente
no hab&iacute;an despertado el suficiente inter&eacute;s, pero
en conjunto superaban el volumen de intercambios de Brasil con
la Comunidad, con una balanza comercial deficitaria en su contra.
La Comunidad les reconoci&oacute; el estatuto de PVD, aunque matizado
seg&uacute;n los diferentes grados de desarrollo de cada pa&iacute;s
y se incluy&oacute; una declaraci&oacute;n unilateral prometiendo
mejoras en el SPG que llegaron con el Reglamento 3.752/83, donde
se estableci&oacute; la aplicaci&oacute;n conjunta a los pa&iacute;ses
del Grupo Andino de la definici&oacute;n de producto originario.
No hubo compromisos financieros concretos y tan s&oacute;lo se
instaba a las partes a poner los medios necesarios para la realizaci&oacute;n
de los objetivos. El acuerdo con los Estados miembros del Mercado
Com&uacute;n Centroamericano (MCCA) y Panam&aacute; se firm&oacute;
en la conferencia de Luxemburgo a imagen del anterior. </P>
<P>
En general todas las concesiones comerciales hechas durante dicho
per&iacute;odo a AL fueron unilaterales, de car&aacute;cter excepcional
y temporales. En el campo econ&oacute;mico en sentido amplio,
se extendieron los &aacute;mbitos materiales de cooperaci&oacute;n
poniendo &eacute;nfasis en la potencialidad del sector privado
(inversiones, capital riesgo, transferencia de tecnolog&iacute;a)
con dos objetivos espec&iacute;ficos: la ampliaci&oacute;n del
mercado interno de Am&eacute;rica Latina y la promoci&oacute;n
de las inversiones europeas directas en la regi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
<B>La diversificaci&oacute;n de la Cooperaci&oacute;n para el
Desarrollo</B> </P>
<P>
Partiendo de m&iacute;nimos, la pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n
comunitaria cre&oacute; una sofisticada red de instrumentos ampliando
sectores para adaptarse a la heterog&eacute;nea realidad latinoamericana.
A pesar de ello, no se respondi&oacute; a todas las expectativas
y en AL se extendi&oacute; la convicci&oacute;n de que Europa
no aportaba una contrapartida econ&oacute;mica suficiente a su
intervenci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica en apoyo de los fr&aacute;giles
procesos democr&aacute;ticos que trataban de salir adelante en
un contexto econ&oacute;mico, social, cultural e internacional
muy desfavorable. Sin embargo, s&iacute; se produjo un salto cuantitativo
de la cooperaci&oacute;n europea aunque gran parte de la ayuda
se trat&oacute; de capitalizar bilateralmente. Espa&ntilde;a,
consciente de sus limitaciones como donante individual, trat&oacute;
de jugar la carta europea y continu&oacute; el discurso aperturista
y globalizador iniciado por el Reino Unido en la d&eacute;cada
anterior. </P>
<P>
Durante la primera mitad de la d&eacute;cada prosigui&oacute;
una cooperaci&oacute;n financiera y t&eacute;cnica de corte cl&aacute;sico
basada en el desarrollo rural, 67% entre 1976-87, mientras la
ayuda industrial recib&iacute;a un 13%, los servicios un 8% y
la reconstrucci&oacute;n un 7%, por lo que se concentraba en las
zonas de menor desarrollo relativo y en sectores de poblaci&oacute;n
necesitada. Despu&eacute;s se inici&oacute; un tipo de cooperaci&oacute;n
m&aacute;s plural en los instrumentos y objetivos, inaugurando
el proceso de diversificaci&oacute;n seg&uacute;n el grado de
desarrollo de los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios que se consolidar&iacute;a
en los noventa. </P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n con AL se estructur&oacute; en tres grandes
categor&iacute;as: la Cooperaci&oacute;n para el Desarrollo, que
comprende cooperaci&oacute;n financiera y t&eacute;cnica, ayuda
alimentaria y ayuda a trav&eacute;s de ONG; &eacute;sta supon&iacute;a
un 90% del total de ayudas comunitarias entre 1976-89; la ayuda
humanitaria, con el 6%; y la llamada Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica,
inicialmente con un 4% pero en ascenso. Al mismo tiempo, la Comunidad
iba afianzando su presencia y adquiriendo experiencia para gestionar
su participaci&oacute;n en los grandes proyectos de la zona; entre
1976 y 1984 dos tercios de los programas comunitarios se cofinanciaron
con otros donantes pero, conforme crec&iacute;an los medios financieros
y los instrumentos, se pas&oacute; a un tipo de <I>cofinanciaci&oacute;n
paralela</I> en la que la CE asum&iacute;a la responsabilidad
exclusiva de parte o todo un sector de un proyecto, hasta que
al final de la d&eacute;cada su participaci&oacute;n se aproxim&oacute;
al 80% del costo total. </P>
<P>
La inclusi&oacute;n del &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n
fue la gran novedad de los acuerdos de segunda generaci&oacute;n;
en el acuerdo con Brasil, dado el mayor desarrollo relativo del
pa&iacute;s, se propuso la reciprocidad e incluso, una cooperaci&oacute;n
cofinanciada respecto a terceros. En cambio, el acuerdo con los
pa&iacute;ses del Grupo andino (receptores de un 50% de la ayuda
financiera y t&eacute;cnica de AL) y el MCCA, recogi&oacute; una
distinci&oacute;n en tres &aacute;mbitos: la cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica, la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo y la
cooperaci&oacute;n comercial; pero su aplicaci&oacute;n se dej&oacute;
a los programas comunitarios sin adquirir obligaciones contractuales.
</P>
<P>
En su expansi&oacute;n hacia nuevas zonas geogr&aacute;ficas la
pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n evolucion&oacute; de un
tratamiento gen&eacute;rico respecto a los destinatarios, pero
limitado en cuanto a los objetivos, a instrumentos m&aacute;s
espec&iacute;ficos dirigidos a determinadas categor&iacute;as
de sujetos. El primer reglamento que dio base jur&iacute;dica
estable a la Cooperaci&oacute;n Financiera y T&eacute;cnica con
los PVD no asociados en 1981 presentaba una cooperaci&oacute;n
asistencial; ayudas en forma de subvenciones no reembolsables
que potenciaban proyectos de desarrollo rural, producci&oacute;n
alimentaria y, de forma marginal, proyectos de integraci&oacute;n
regional y ayuda a la reconstrucci&oacute;n en caso de cat&aacute;strofes
naturales. La prioridad para los PVD menos desarrollados limitaba
el acceso de AL a los fondos de modo que s&oacute;lo CA y los
pa&iacute;ses menos desarrollados del Pacto Andino fueron destinatarios
de importancia. Cada a&ntilde;o se establec&iacute;a una clave
de reparto geogr&aacute;fico que comenz&oacute; siendo del 73%
para Asia, el 20% para Am&eacute;rica Latina y el 7% para &ccedil;frica
y fue acortando distancias hasta que en 1988 se separaron las
l&iacute;neas presupuestarias haciendo posible que un aumento
para AL no repercutiera en Asia, aunque se pact&oacute; un 65%
para a Asia y un 35% a AL. La adjudicaci&oacute;n de las ayudas
se hac&iacute;a por la comisi&oacute;n PVD-ALA compuesta de representantes
de los Estados miembros sin que el beneficiario participase m&aacute;s
que dando su consentimiento en el convenio de financiaci&oacute;n.
</P>
<P>
Al final de la d&eacute;cada, algunos gobiernos latinoamericanos
tomaron la iniciativa de presentar a la Comunidad solicitudes
de financiaci&oacute;n para proyectos propios integrados en programas
de &aacute;mbito nacional, contribuyendo a la dinamizaci&oacute;n
de las estrategias de desarrollo dise&ntilde;adas por las autoridades
locales. As&iacute;, Centroam&eacute;rica acudi&oacute; a <I>San
Jos&eacute; IV</I> en 1988 con el Plan de Acci&oacute;n Inmediata.
En 1989, el Gobierno boliviano present&oacute; el <I>Programa
de autodesarrollo campesino</I>; se firm&oacute; un convenio de
financiaci&oacute;n con Per&uacute; para un Programa de desarrollo
del Altiplano y se colabor&oacute; en el <I>Plan especial de Cooperaci&oacute;n
para Colombia</I>. Estos programas iban destinados a eliminar
focos de marginaci&oacute;n y conflictividad social, con la finalidad
de contribuir a una estabilidad de los Gobiernos democr&aacute;ticos.
</P>
<P>
Dentro de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica se abrieron las
l&iacute;neas de promoci&oacute;n comercial con 23 MECUS hasta
1989, cooperaci&oacute;n energ&eacute;tica (21 MECUS), promoci&oacute;n
industrial y de las inversiones (20 MECUS). Adem&aacute;s de apoyo
a la integraci&oacute;n regional y medio ambiente incorporados
al final con cantidades marginales. </P>
<P>
En las llamadas pol&iacute;ticas horizontales de cooperaci&oacute;n,
por no tener un destinatario regional, la participaci&oacute;n
de AL fue minoritaria, a lo cual se uni&oacute; la magritud de
los fondos del presupuesto (salvo la ayuda alimentaria). En 1982
se aprob&oacute; el primer programa de la ciencia y la t&eacute;cnica
al servicio del desarrollo 1982-1986, a los que se asociaron centros
latinoamericanos en un 15% de proyectos, dobl&aacute;ndose las
dotaciones en 1987. Del programa de cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica
internacional pod&iacute;an beneficiarse s&oacute;lo aquellos
PVD con los que la Comunidad ten&iacute;a firmados acuerdos de
Cooperaci&oacute;n (pa&iacute;ses ALAMED), e iba destinado a fomentar
la movilidad de los cient&iacute;ficos de los PVD. </P>
<P>
Debido a las cr&iacute;ticas, la ayuda alimentaria fue objeto
de una reforma que la desvincul&oacute; de la gesti&oacute;n de
los excedentes agr&iacute;colas integr&aacute;ndola en la pol&iacute;tica
global de desarrollo de la Comunidad. La participaci&oacute;n
de AL se concentr&oacute; en los pa&iacute;ses de renta m&aacute;s
baja, destacando la ayuda a los refugiados y personas desplazadas
a causa del conflicto centroamericano. </P>
<P>
En octubre de 1983 se cre&oacute; el Instituto de Relaciones Europa-Am&eacute;rica
Latina (IRELA) con el objetivo de fortalecer las relaciones entre
la Comunidad Europea y Am&eacute;rica Latina, as&iacute; como
prestar su asistencia a las instituciones comunitarias. A partir
de entonces se dedic&oacute; a promocionar la investigaci&oacute;n
y facilitar el di&aacute;logo sobre cuestiones interregionales.

Debido a los importantes cambios en la escena internacional era
previsible que la atenci&oacute;n europea se concentrase en los
procesos pol&iacute;ticos y econ&oacute;micos de sus vecinos contiguos,
pero otros factores coadyuvaron al decaimiento de la atenci&oacute;n
europea por AL: los procesos de democratizaci&oacute;n en la regi&oacute;n
se iban consolidando, al tiempo que cierta recuperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica y la aceptaci&oacute;n de la disciplina presupuestaria
no hac&iacute;an temer por un incumplimiento de los compromisos
sobre deuda externa. A ello se unieron condicionantes del propio
proceso de construcci&oacute;n comunitaria para la firma del Tratado
sobre la Uni&oacute;n Europea (TUE) de 1992 en Maastricht y las
negociaciones para el ingreso de los tres candidatos n&oacute;rdicos
m&aacute;s Austria. Finalmente, la cumbre de Essen consagr&oacute;
la estrategia de apertura al Este para su futura integraci&oacute;n
en la Uni&oacute;n y el desarrollo de una nueva pol&iacute;tica
de cooperaci&oacute;n con los pa&iacute;ses mediterr&aacute;neos.
</P>
<P>
<B>Consolidaci&oacute;n del di&aacute;logo</B> </P>
<P>
En el terreno pol&iacute;tico se opera un viraje desde una estrategia
reactiva a corto plazo a una acci&oacute;n sostenida basada en
el di&aacute;logo permanente y con vocaci&oacute;n de sustituir
la pasada concatenaci&oacute;n de actos unilaterales por medidas
concertadas. </P>
<P>
El inter&eacute;s europeo por influir en el restablecimiento de
las democracias se materializ&oacute; en la condicionalidad pol&iacute;tica,
mal asimilada en AL donde se&ntilde;alan la contradicci&oacute;n
entre esta extraordinaria preocupaci&oacute;n por la integridad
de las instituciones democr&aacute;ticas latinoamericanas y la
negativa a cambiar pol&iacute;ticas econ&oacute;micas(Heine, 1991)
que obstaculizaban el acceso a los mercados comunitarios. A pesar
de ello, se impuso la llamada cl&aacute;usula democr&aacute;tica,
por la cual la aplicaci&oacute;n de las disposiciones reglamentarias
o los acuerdos interregionales y bilaterales queda sometida al
mantenimiento del Estado de Derecho democr&aacute;tico y al respeto
a los Derechos Humanos. </P>
<P>
Tras la institucionalizaci&oacute;n del di&aacute;logo con el
Grupo de R&iacute;o parecen haberse consolidado dos subdi&aacute;logos
que cubren toda la regi&oacute;n, salvo Cuba. En el di&aacute;logo
con Centroam&eacute;rica el eje de gravedad bascul&oacute; hacia
cuestiones econ&oacute;micas y el apoyo a la reconstrucci&oacute;n.
Para ello contaron con un instrumento a trav&eacute;s del cual
implementar la ayuda, el acuerdo de Cooperaci&oacute;n, y un marco
donde situarla, el Plan Especial de Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica
para Centroam&eacute;rica (PEC) patrocinado por la ONU. </P>
<P>
En el aspecto pol&iacute;tico la Comunidad mantuvo dos objetivos
respecto a CA: el cese de los conflictos con la instauraci&oacute;n
de reg&iacute;menes democr&aacute;ticos y el estrechamiento de
los v&iacute;nculos interregionales como medida de seguridad para
evitar el resurgimiento de los conflictos(Galinsoga, A., 1995).
Las declaraciones de las conferencias de la serie <I>San Jos&eacute;</I>
se acompa&ntilde;aron de un importante aumento de la cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica, sobre todo en programas de reconstrucci&oacute;n
y reinserci&oacute;n de refugiados que convirti&oacute; a Centroam&eacute;rica
en la primera regi&oacute;n receptora de ayuda comunitaria per
c&aacute;pita (Del Arenal, 1994). </P>
<P>
La Conferencia de Roma con el Grupo de R&iacute;o en diciembre
de 1990 fue convocada con expresa intenci&oacute;n de institucionalizar
este foro, al fracasar la apuesta italiana por la ALADI. La controversia
resid&iacute;a en la diferente naturaleza de ambas instancias;
ALADI es un organismo estructurado para estimular el acercamiento
comercial entre sus miembros, por lo que las coordenadas pol&iacute;ticas
externas le son ajenas, por el contrario, la naturaleza pol&iacute;tica
y no org&aacute;nica del Grupo de R&iacute;o dificulta considerar
ese di&aacute;logo como una negociaci&oacute;n, dada la asimetr&iacute;a
de los interlocutores. </P>
<P>
Tras la conferencia de Luxemburgo en abril de 1991, donde se firm&oacute;
el acuerdo con M&eacute;xico, vino la de Santiago de Chile en
mayo de 1992, condicionada por la situaci&oacute;n en Per&uacute;
y los intentos de golpe de Estado en Venezuela. Una vez reincorporado
Per&uacute; se firm&oacute; el acuerdo marco con el Pacto Andino
en la reuni&oacute;n de Copenhague en 1993 y la conferencia de
abril de 1994 adopt&oacute; la <I>Declaraci&oacute;n de Sao Paulo</I>,
que estableci&oacute; pautas para una serie de acciones conjuntas
en el plano pol&iacute;tico, econ&oacute;mico y de cooperaci&oacute;n
con el fin de promover los intercambios en el inter&eacute;s mutuo
de las dos regiones. Subsiste la duda sobre el alcance real de
la cooperaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica en un mundo en que las relaciones
econ&oacute;micas dominan las relaciones de poder. Sin embargo,
dada la escasa atenci&oacute;n que AL recibe de Europa, la posibilidad
de hacer o&iacute;r su voz de manera regular sigue siendo una
importante baza a la hora de plantear nuevas v&iacute;as de acercamiento.
</P>
<P>
En el plano interregional, la Comisi&oacute;n elabor&oacute; una
propuesta de documento sobre las nuevas<I> Orientaciones para
la cooperaci&oacute;n con Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia en la d&eacute;cada
de los noventa,</I> en junio de 1990, basado en el apoyo a la
democracia y los Derechos Humanos con la generalizaci&oacute;n
de la cl&aacute;usula democr&aacute;tica unido al desarrollo sostenible,
que introduce la dimensi&oacute;n ambiental en la pol&iacute;tica
de cooperaci&oacute;n. Dentro de &eacute;sta, se distingu&iacute;a
entre la destinada a los pa&iacute;ses mas pobres y la cooperaci&oacute;n
avanzada destinada a los pa&iacute;ses o regiones de renta media,
pero concebida en t&eacute;rminos de reciprocidad. El 31 de Octubre
de 1994, el Consejo Europeo de la UE aprob&oacute; el Documento
B&aacute;sico sobre las relaciones de la Uni&oacute;n Europea
con Am&eacute;rica Latina y el Caribe que propone una nueva colaboraci&oacute;n
basada en los valores democr&aacute;ticos (cita tres interlocutores:
el Grupo de R&iacute;o, Am&eacute;rica Central y Mercosur) y ofrece
iniciar conversaciones sobre nuevos acuerdos m&aacute;s ambiciosos.
</P>
<P>
El Parlamento Europeo a trav&eacute;s de su di&aacute;logo privilegiado
en las Conferencias Interparlamentarias, se ha convertido en el
portavoz ordinario de las preocupaciones latinoamericanas e inductor
de nuevos instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n. En apoyo a la integraci&oacute;n
regional la Comisi&oacute;n ha celebrado acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n
interinstitucional con sus hom&oacute;logas en los sistemas de
cooperaci&oacute;n interregional y abri&oacute; nuevas delegaciones
u oficinas permanentes de la Comunidad. Finalmente formaliz&oacute;
su estatuto de observador en la Organizaci&oacute;n de Estados
Americanos (OEA), la ALADI y el SELA. Todo ello se traduce en
la creaci&oacute;n de una red ordinaria de intercambios que se
suma al di&aacute;logo de las cumbres y a la realizada de forma
bilateral entre la Comunidad y los pa&iacute;ses con los que tiene
firmados acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
El 2 de abril de 1990, con la firma del primer Acuerdo Marco de
Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica con Argentina, se inaugur&oacute;
la serie de los llamados acuerdos de <I>Tercera Generaci&oacute;n</I>
donde se aplicaba en el plano bilateral las nuevas orientaciones.
</P>
<P>
Posteriormente se firmaron nuevos acuerdos hasta cubrir casi la
totalidad de la regi&oacute;n: Chile, en diciembre de 1990, M&eacute;xico
en abril de 1991, Uruguay en noviembre de 1991, Paraguay en febrero
de 1992, Brasil en junio de 1992 y en 1993, el acuerdo con Centroam&eacute;rica
en febrero y con el Pacto Andino en abril. </P>
<P>
Destacan cuatro caracter&iacute;sticas claves (De Juan y Pe&ntilde;alosa,
R., 1991): el condicionamiento democr&aacute;tico de la cooperaci&oacute;n,
recogido en cl&aacute;usula expresa (salvo en el acuerdo con M&eacute;xico);
la importancia de la cooperaci&oacute;n industrial, cient&iacute;fica
y tecnol&oacute;gica; la concepci&oacute;n del acuerdo como un
instrumento de estrategia global de desarrollo y la cl&aacute;usula
evolutiva que permite ampliar y profundizar los niveles de cooperaci&oacute;n
por mutuo consentimiento. Estos acuerdos son el marco obligado
para acceder a los nuevos instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n avanzada;
sin embargo, al no acompa&ntilde;arse de un protocolo financiero,
la financiaci&oacute;n depender&aacute; de las asignaciones presupuestarias
que decida la Uni&oacute;n Europea. </P>
<P>
<B>Cooperaci&oacute;n comercial</B> </P>
<P>
El SPG, que experiment&oacute; una p&eacute;rdida acumulada de
las ventajas comerciales como resultado de la progresiva disminuci&oacute;n
de los aranceles comunitarios respecto a terceros Estados y la
ampliaci&oacute;n de barreras no arancelarias, fue reformado con
la sustituci&oacute;n de la antigua diferenciaci&oacute;n en productos
y pa&iacute;ses por la aplicaci&oacute;n de dos nuevas t&eacute;cnicas:
el mecanismo de graduaci&oacute;n, que mide el grado de dependencia
del pa&iacute;s beneficiario respecto al producto y el nivel de
ingresos per c&aacute;pita junto al nivel de exportaciones hacia
la UE, y el mecanismo de solidaridad aplicado en caso de que un
solo pa&iacute;s acapare el 25% excluy&eacute;ndolo del SPG. </P>
<P>
En el plano bilateral, los acuerdos marco no aportan cambios de
r&eacute;gimen apreciables, en cambio, suscita expectativas el
acuerdo interregional de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica y
comercial con MERCOSUR del 15 de diciembre de 1995, pues supone
una apertura negociada y rec&iacute;proca de los mercados y no
una concesi&oacute;n voluntaria y unilateral. La comunicaci&oacute;n
de la Comisi&oacute;n al Consejo <I>Para un refuerzo de la pol&iacute;tica
de la UE hacia MERCOSUR</I> propuso una estrategia en dos etapas:
una de transici&oacute;n que, mediante la conclusi&oacute;n del
acuerdo, prepare la liberalizaci&oacute;n de los intercambios
al tiempo que da apoyo t&eacute;cnico, industrial y financiero
al proceso de integraci&oacute;n; y, posteriormente, una asociaci&oacute;n
interregional fundada en una relaci&oacute;n equilibrada en el
plano econ&oacute;mico, pol&iacute;tico y comercial y cuyos principales
ejes son el establecimiento flexible y progresivo de una zona
de libre cambio en el terreno industrial y una liberalizaci&oacute;n
rec&iacute;proca y progresiva de los intercambios. </P>
<P>
Los acuerdos actuales act&uacute;an como condici&oacute;n previa
a mecanismos de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica aunque el
acceso concreto se regula mediante convenios espec&iacute;ficos
bilaterales o acuerdos interinstitucionales. Son instrumentos
no creados originalmente para AL sino para zonas de inter&eacute;s
prioritario, pero le fueron extendidos de forma provisional y
restringida y suponen el acceso a nuevas fuentes de inversi&oacute;n
y el fortalecimiento del tejido empresarial mediante lazos interregionales.
Algunos son: la extensi&oacute;n de las operaciones Banco Europeo
de Inversiones (BEI) en abril de 1991 por un per&iacute;odo de
tres a&ntilde;os; el European Community Investment Partners (ECIP),
un instrumento de promoci&oacute;n de la inversi&oacute;n privada
a trav&eacute;s de la creaci&oacute;n de empresas mixtas entre
operadores comunitarios y los de otras regiones; y el BC-Net,
un sistema inform&aacute;tico dedicado a las Peque&ntilde;as y
Medianas Empresas (PYME) que vincula a directivos para que eval&uacute;en
posibles formas de cooperaci&oacute;n y contacten con socios potenciales.

Tanto las Orientaciones para la Cooperaci&oacute;n con Am&eacute;rica
Latina y Asia de junio de 1990, como el acuerdo del Consejo del
19 de diciembre de 1990 sobre las <I>Orientaciones generales de
la Cooperaci&oacute;n financiera y t&eacute;cnica en favor de
los PVD de Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia para el per&iacute;odo
1991-1995</I>, mantuvieron los grandes ejes de la cooperaci&oacute;n
introduciendo una nueva prioridad en la dimensi&oacute;n estructural
como apoyo a los programas de ajuste econ&oacute;mico en la que
se prev&eacute; la concertaci&oacute;n con otros donantes. La
ayuda queda condicionada pol&iacute;ticamente, salvo las actividades
que tengan como beneficiario directo a poblaciones que sufren
graves penurias. Del conjunto de 2.750 MECUS para el per&iacute;odo,
un 65% se destina a Asia y un 35% a AL </P>
<P>
El nuevo Reglamento de base n&#186; 443/92 de 25 de febrero de
1992 recoge las orientaciones enunciando los cuatro sectores clave
de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica: aumentar el potencial
cient&iacute;fico y tecnol&oacute;gico, apoyo a las instituciones
democr&aacute;ticas, ayuda a las Pyme mediante la promoci&oacute;n
comercial y la formaci&oacute;n de t&eacute;cnicos y cooperaci&oacute;n
regional. Con car&aacute;cter general, ambas modalidades de cooperaci&oacute;n
tendr&aacute;n la forma de subvenciones no reembolsables y, en
lo posible, se establecer&aacute; una programaci&oacute;n plurianual
indicativa por objetivos, por pa&iacute;ses o por regiones. Se
procurar&aacute; conseguir sistem&aacute;ticamente la participaci&oacute;n
financiera de receptores, Estados miembros y otros donantes. </P>
<P>
A partir de 1992, la pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n para
el desarrollo de la CE tuvo que adaptarse a la nueva regulaci&oacute;n
del TUE que le otorg&oacute; una base jur&iacute;dica expresa.
La Comisi&oacute;n elabor&oacute; el documento <I>La Pol&iacute;tica
de Cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo en el horizonte del a&ntilde;o
2000</I> asoci&aacute;ndola al desarrollo de la pol&iacute;tica
exterior europea. Para AL propuso fomentar las inversiones y el
sector privado al tiempo que se da un apoyo a las reformas econ&oacute;micas,
concentrando la AOD en los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s pobres; y
a escala regional, en CA la consolidaci&oacute;n del proceso de
paz y el apoyo a la modernizaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica; en
los pa&iacute;ses andinos, el apoyo a las reformas econ&oacute;micas
y para los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s avanzados, una cooperaci&oacute;n
con mayor presencia de los agentes econ&oacute;micos europeos.
</P>
<P>
Los nuevos acuerdos de tercera generaci&oacute;n introdujeron
la cooperaci&oacute;n avanzada, pero no crearon instrumentos para
practicarla, as&iacute; que se deber&aacute; acudir a la negociaci&oacute;n
y contractualizaci&oacute;n en los casos de relaci&oacute;n rec&iacute;proca
de cooperaci&oacute;n, y a la aprobaci&oacute;n unilateral m&aacute;s
aceptaci&oacute;n en los casos de ayuda concesional. En definitiva,
las relaciones entre la Comunidad y AL se expandieron al comenzar

<TR><TD>Abstract <TD>In the following article, it is argued, unlike commonly held assumptions about the impossibility of Latin American cooperation, that recent empirical evidence authorize a different and more optimistic view on the subject.  The author sustains that after experiencing a serious economic and political crisis during the first half of the Eighties, three    regional cooperation systems (Central America, the English Speaking Caribbean, and the Southern Cone) begun to recover their strength during the second half of the past decade.  The article further contends that whilst it is true that trade and financial flows are important indicators, more attentions should be devoted to the position adopted by the regional and extra-regional powers (i.e. hegemony in international relations) if we want to have a correct assessment of Latin American cooperation and its possibilities of success.                                         Finally, the author suggests that EC aid to Latin America would gain greater significance if, instead of been mostly bilateral, it were given by the EC to the Latin American coopereation systems.

<A NAME="abs"><h3>Abstract:</h3><P></A>
<H3>The European Union and the Cono Sur embark on the process
of reconciliation</H3>
<P>
The intention of this study is to mark out a panorama of the evolution
of ties between the European Union (EU) and the socalled Cono
Sur, (Argentina, Uruguay and Chile) emphasising those factors
which have discouraged the development of full relations in the
economic sphere and those others which have favoured a new phase
of reciprocal understanding. 
<P>
The study is made up of four clearly defined parts covering the
misunderstandings which have characterised economic relations;
the reformulation of European cooperation towards the Cono Sur
countries; the participation of the Cono Sur in bi-regional dialogue
and, more importantly, the rationalization of EU-Cono Sur relations
as a result of the creation of the MERCOSUR. Towards the end of
the study the possibilities of a greater interregional copenetration
in the light of the evolution of the current international system
are analysed.

<a name=int><h3>Introducci&#243;n</h3>
Por primera vez, desde la entrada en vigor de la Comunidad Europea
(CE), hoy Uni&oacute;n Europea (UE), en 1958, es atinado decir
que hay lugar a la esperanza de una verdadera recomposici&oacute;n
de las relaciones entre la UE y el Cono Sur. La firma del Acuerdo
Marco Interregional de Cooperaci&oacute;n entre la Uni&oacute;n
Europea y el Mercado Com&uacute;n del Sur (MERCOSUR), el 15 de
diciembre de 1995 en Madrid, pone en evidencia, por encima de
otras consideraciones, que la pol&iacute;tica exterior de la UE
ha dado m&aacute;xima prioridad a una subregi&oacute;n de Am&eacute;rica
Latina. El hecho de que la UE se haya fijado en el MERCOSUR para
establecer una estrecha cooperaci&oacute;n, con vistas a la formaci&oacute;n
de una futura asociaci&oacute;n de libre comercio, no es fruto
de la casualidad. Ello supone un aval al proceso integrador m&aacute;s
avanzado dentro de los Pa&iacute;ses en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo
(PVD) y, como afirma un documento del Parlamento Europeo (PE 211.641/Def.),
el reconocimiento a una zona de prosperidad emergente con un gran
potencial de crecimiento y cuyo dinamismo econ&oacute;mico durante
los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os &uacute;nica-mente ha sido superado
por los pa&iacute;ses del Sudeste asi&aacute;tico. </P>
<P>
Los promotores del proceso integrador  los Gobiernos democr&aacute;ticos
de Argentina y Brasil-, envueltos en la d&eacute;cada pasada en
enormes dificultades, derivadas principalmente de la inflaci&oacute;n
y la crisis de la deuda externa, vieron en la integraci&oacute;n
una alternativa de esfuerzo com&uacute;n para superar los retos
del sistema internacional actual, y una forma de cooperar en beneficio
de la subregi&oacute;n, dejando de lado viejas disputas de hegemon&iacute;a
en el Cono Sur de Am&eacute;rica. La posterior consolidaci&oacute;n
de la iniciativa en el contexto subregional, a partir de la incorporaci&oacute;n
de Paraguay y Uruguay, formalizada en la firma del Tratado de
Asunci&oacute;n en 1991, abri&oacute; una nueva dimensi&oacute;n
del proceso integrador que tuvo insospechadas repercusiones en
el contexto internacional. Hoy por hoy, el MERCOSUR es la cuarta
econom&iacute;a del mundo, despu&eacute;s de la Uni&oacute;n Europea,
el Tratado Norteamericano de Libre Comercio (TLC) y Jap&oacute;n.
</P>
<P>
La decisi&oacute;n de la UE de concluir un acuerdo interregional
con el MERCOSUR tiene enorme trascendencia, ya que se trata de
algo que parec&iacute;a inimaginable hace s&oacute;lo cinco a&ntilde;os.
Por entonces las prioridades de la pol&iacute;tica exterior comunitaria
estaban bien definidas, y entre ellas no figuraba el Cono Sur
de Am&eacute;rica. En aquel contexto, a los tradicionales lazos
preferenciales otorgados por la CE al conjunto de paises ACP (&#193;frica,
Caribe y Pac&iacute;fico) y a los pa&iacute;ses de la cuenca mediterr&aacute;nea,
hab&iacute;a que a&ntilde;adir el inter&eacute;s de la CE por
los vertiginosos acontecimientos prefigurados por el final de
la Guerra Fr&iacute;a y la descomposici&oacute;n del bloque de
pa&iacute;ses socialistas iniciados a mediados de 1989. Teniendo
en cuenta la proximidad del escenario de estos acontecimientos,
la problem&aacute;tica de los Pa&iacute;ses de Europa Central
y Oriental (PECOS) emergi&oacute; como una cuesti&oacute;n prioritaria
en la agenda internacional de la CE. Tambi&eacute;n en el &aacute;mbito
europeo cabe mencionar que la creciente vinculaci&oacute;n entre
la CE y los pa&iacute;ses miembros de la EFTA (Asociaci&oacute;n
Europea de Libre Comercio) dio paso a la creaci&oacute;n del Espacio
Econ&oacute;mico Europeo (EEE), a partir del uno de enero de 1994,
extendiendo as&iacute; el Mercado &ograve;nico Europeo (MUE) a
Austria, Finlandia, Islandia, Noruega y Suecia. El acercamiento
culmin&oacute; con el ingreso de este grupo de pa&iacute;ses,
con excepci&oacute;n de Islandia y Noruega, como miembros de pleno
derecho, a la UE a partir del uno de enero de 1995. </P>
<P>
La decisi&oacute;n de la UE de llevar a cabo una profundizaci&oacute;n
de su proceso de integraci&oacute;n desplaz&oacute; a un segundo
plano otras cuestiones, como el incremento de la cooperaci&oacute;n
con regiones extracomunitarias. Los acontecimientos de fundamental
importancia que se desarrollaban en el &aacute;mbito intraeuropeo,
tales como la evoluci&oacute;n del MUE<a href="#1">(1)</a>, el ambicioso proyecto
sobre la Uni&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica Europea (UPE) y la Uni&oacute;n
Econ&oacute;mica y Monetaria (UEM) acordado en el Tratado de Uni&oacute;n
Europea, firmado en Maastricht el siete de febrero de 1992, y
la adopci&oacute;n de medidas para contrarrestar la recesi&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica que en mayor y menor medida ha afectado &uacute;ltimamente
a casi todos los Estados miembros de la UE; todos ellos, alejaban
a&uacute;n m&aacute;s las esperanzas de entablar negociaciones
en torno a un acuerdo interregional UE-MERCOSUR. </P>
<P>
Si bien es plausible el optimismo que actualmente se observa en
torno al nuevo panorama que se presenta a partir de la firma del
Acuerdo Marco Interregional, la historia de las relaciones entre
la UE y el Cono Sur ha estado marcada por los desencuentros. En
efecto, ser&iacute;a bueno no olvidar que se trata de unas relaciones
que durante las tres primeras d&eacute;cadas, desde la fundaci&oacute;n
de la CE en 1957, han sido pr&aacute;cticamente inexistentes en
lo pol&iacute;tico y han retrocedido en lo econ&oacute;mico. Ya
bien entrados los a&ntilde;os ochenta puede decirse que la CE
se interes&oacute; por fomentar v&iacute;nculos pol&iacute;ticos
con pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos. Este cambio de actitud obedeci&oacute;
tanto a causas intr&iacute;nsecas, como a la imagen de superpotencia
internacional que busca capitalizar la Comunidad. Entre las causas
intr&iacute;nsecas se destaca la ambici&oacute;n de la Comisi&oacute;n
Europea de formular una pol&iacute;tica exterior con una sola
voz e independiente de los intereses particulares de los Estados
miembros de la CE. Por otro lado, la proyecci&oacute;n de una
pol&iacute;tica exterior ambiciosa y de peso a nivel mundial no
pod&iacute;a permitirse la torpeza de estar ausente en una regi&oacute;n
de la dimensi&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica y econ&oacute;mica de Am&eacute;rica
Latina. Es preciso destacar el importante rol que ha jugado Espa&ntilde;a
en favor de la intensificaci&oacute;n de las relaciones entre
la Comuniddad y Am&eacute;rica Latina, incluso antes del ingreso
de este pa&iacute;s en la CE. </P>
<P>
<a name=rel></a><h3>Las relaciones econ&#243;micas entre la UE y el Cono Sur</h3>
</P>
<P>
Cada vez que se aborda el estudio de las relaciones econ&oacute;micas
entre la UE y el Cono Sur es indispensable tener en cuenta que
la UE es -respecto del Cono Sur- el principal socio comercial
, junto con EEUU. Ignorar este dato ser&iacute;a faltar a la realidad.
Pero si este hecho sirviera para afirmar que las relaciones econ&oacute;micas
interregionales pasan por un buen momento se estar&iacute;a faltando
a la verdad. En este sentido, la hist&oacute;rica complementariedad
que caracteriza a las estructuras productivas de ambas regiones
y la importancia que tuvieron los v&iacute;nculos econ&oacute;micos
interregionales, con anterioridad a la implementaci&oacute;n de
pol&iacute;ticas proteccionistas por parte de la UE, constituyen
la mejor garant&iacute;a sobre las potencialidades que ofrecen
las castigadas relaciones econ&oacute;micas UE-Cono Sur. </P>
<P>
<B>Proteccionismo comunitario y comercio UE-Cono Sur</B> </P>
<P>
El comercio UE-Cono Sur ha estado condicionado en gran medida
por la aplicaci&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas proteccionistas por
parte de la UE en favor de sus productos nacionales. Esta situaci&oacute;n
se torn&oacute; especialmente delicada en lo que se refiere a
productos agr&iacute;colas, los cuales representan la mayor parte
de los productos de exportaci&oacute;n de los pa&iacute;ses del
Cono Sur.En el momento de la firma del Tratado de Roma (1957),
los seis Estados signatarios del mismo, Rep&uacute;blica Federal
Alemana, Francia, Italia, B&eacute;lgica, Pa&iacute;ses Bajos
y Luxemburgo manten&iacute;an importantes v&iacute;nculos comerciales
con los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur. Las ventajas comparativas
que ofrec&iacute;a la estructura del comercio exterior de ambos
lados favorec&iacute;a la fluidez de los intercambios: los europeos
compraban fundamentalmente materias primas de origen agropecuario
en el Cono Sur, a la vez que vend&iacute;an en la sub-regi&oacute;n
productos industriales. La concentraci&oacute;n en una limitada
gama de productos, que siempre ha caracterizado a la estructura
del comercio UE-Cono Sur, no constitu&iacute;a un obst&aacute;culo,
sino que, por el contrario, ambas partes aprovechaban, sin interferencias
proteccionistas, las complementariedades que presentaban ambas
econom&iacute;as. </P>
<P>
Esta situaci&oacute;n cambi&oacute; radicalmente desde que, a
principios de los a&ntilde;os sesenta, la CE implement&oacute;
la altamente proteccionista Pol&iacute;tica Agr&iacute;cola Com&uacute;n
(PAC) por la cual instituy&oacute; un sistema de precios comunes
y de ayuda a la producci&oacute;n y a la comercializaci&oacute;n,
y mecanismos para la estabilizaci&oacute;n de las importaciones
y exportaciones. El proteccionismo agr&iacute;cola se convirti&oacute;
as&iacute; en uno de los ejes de la construcci&oacute;n europea,
cuyos prop&oacute;sitos eran, b&aacute;sicamente, frenar un &eacute;xodo
masivo de pobladores rurales a los grandes centros urbanos, asegurar
a los consumidores europeos alimentos a precios asequibles y estables,
y garantizar a los agricultores ingresos proporcionales a su trabajo.
En pocos a&ntilde;os, la CE no s&oacute;lo consigui&oacute; su
objetivo de autoabastecimiento de productos agropecuarios, sino
que adem&aacute;s se convirti&oacute; en competidor desleal en
los mercados internacionales. Sin lugar a dudas, la PAC introdujo
un sesgo altamente negativo para aquellos pa&iacute;ses tradicionalmente
exportadores de productos agropecuarios de clima templado que,
como en el caso de los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur, pasaron de
proveedores a competidores en condiciones desventajosas. Estos
pa&iacute;ses sudamericanos asistieron, en una primera fase, a
su propia desaparici&oacute;n en el mercado europeo, para luego
contemplar como una competencia desleal de la CE les arrasaba
en otros mercados como Oriente Medio, &ccedil;frica del Norte
y Europa Oriental (los productos agropecuarios m&aacute;s perjudicados
por la PAC son la carne y los cereales). </P>
<P>
El ingreso de carne bovina del Cono Sur al mercado europeo se
redujo sustancialmente a partir de los a&ntilde;os setenta como
resultado de los precios de intervenci&oacute;n que la CE aplic&oacute;
para alentar la producci&oacute;n local (estos precios alcanzaron
al doble de los internacionales para contrarrestar las desventajas
competitivas). El fracaso de los acuerdos comerciales CE/Argentina
y CE/Uruguay, concluidos en 1971 y 1973, respectivamente, para
favorecer las exportaciones de carnes bovinas de ambos pa&iacute;ses
al mercado comunitario fue el preludio de un contencioso comercial
que empa&ntilde;ar&iacute;a las relaciones comerciales Comunidad-Cono
Sur hasta nuestros d&iacute;as. A principios de los a&ntilde;os
ochenta, la CE -que hab&iacute;a sido un importante comprador
de carne bovina en el mercado mundial hasta la d&eacute;cada anterior-
emergi&oacute; como exportador y competidor desleal de pa&iacute;ses
tradicionalmente exportadores de este producto como Argentina,
Brasil, Uruguay y Paraguay. En 1988 la CE ocup&oacute; el primer
lugar como exportador mundial de carne subsidiada, seguido por
Australia y Brasil (Argentina ocupa el quinto lugar y Uruguay
el sexto). </P>
<P>
La competencia desleal de la CE tambi&eacute;n se traslad&oacute;
al mercado internacional de cereales, principalmente de trigo.
El pa&iacute;s m&aacute;s perjudicado en este sector ha sido Argentina,
dada la importancia de este producto como componente de sus exportaciones.
Por otra parte, la guerra de subsidios que en 1985 desataron la
CE y EEUU para favorecer la competitividad de sus exportaciones
de cereales ha provocado una baja del precio internacional de
los cereales con consecuencias negativas para las exportaciones
argentinas. La UE cubre actualmente el 17% del mercado mundial
de trigo y ha desplazado a Argentina de potenciales oportunidades
en la comercializaci&oacute;n de ese cereal. </P>
<P>
En consecuencia, el comercio entre la CE y Latinoam&eacute;rica
se vio sensiblemente afectado: mientras que a principios de los
a&ntilde;os setenta el mercado europeo absorv&iacute;a el 30%
de las exportaciones latinoamericanas, a mediados de los a&ntilde;os
ochenta s&oacute;lo se destin&oacute; a la CE el 19% del total
exportado. Asimismo, la participaci&oacute;n latinoamericana en
las exportaciones extracomunitarias disminuy&oacute; del 4% al
2% en la d&eacute;cada pasada. </P>
<P>
<B>Reforma de la PAC y conclusi&oacute;n de la Ronda Uruguay del
GATT</B> </P>
<P>
Esta situaci&oacute;n experiment&oacute; un giro importante a
partir de la d&eacute;cada actual, gracias a que ha ido ganando
posiciones una tendencia en favor de la liberalizaci&oacute;n
del comercio mundial y la eliminaci&oacute;n del proteccionismo.
En este contexto tuvieron lugar dos acontecimientos en el &aacute;mbito
del comercio mundial que revisten la mayor trascendencia en el
desarrollo de las corrientes comerciales mundiales y abren expectativas
favorables en el comercio UE-Cono Sur. </P>
<P>
Por un lado, la reforma de la PAC, aprobada el 21 de Mayo de 1992,
fue motivada por los fenomenales gastos que supon&iacute;a el
apoyo agr&iacute;cola y la producci&oacute;n de excedentes agr&iacute;colas
sin mercados reales de consumo; tambi&eacute;n por la necesidad
de fomentar la competitividad y la presi&oacute;n internacional
que los pa&iacute;ses productores agr&iacute;colas de otras regiones
han ejercido sobre la CE para llegar a un acuerdo multilateral
de liberalizaci&oacute;n agr&iacute;cola, en el marco de la Ronda
Uruguay sobre Aranceles Aduaneros y Comercio (GATT). La nueva
normativa promueve un cambio del &eacute;nfasis del sistema de
apoyo de los mercados agr&iacute;colas a un sistema de apoyo directo
a los agricultores europeos. Si bien a corto y a medio plazo esta
reforma no tendr&aacute; un impacto importante en las corrientes
comerciales con el Cono Sur, lo cierto es que se trata de un primer
paso en la reinstrumentaci&oacute;n y cambio de direcci&oacute;n
del sistema de apoyo a la agricultura de la UE al introducir un
sistema de pagos directos y la reducci&oacute;n de tierras de
producci&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
De otro lado, pero vinculado con lo anterior, la firma del Acta
Final de la Ronda Uruguay del GATT por 124 pa&iacute;ses (entre
ellos los cinco del Cono Sur y la UE) en la reuni&oacute;n celebrada
en Marrakech, entre el 12 y el 15 de abril de 1994, supone un
paso en el buen sentido para la liberalizaci&oacute;n del comercio
mundial. Seg&uacute;n el GATT, la aprobaci&oacute;n de la Ronda
Uruguay provocar&aacute; un incremento anual de la renta mundial
cifrado en 235.000 millones de d&oacute;lares y unos aumentos
anuales del comercio por un valor de 755.000 millones de d&oacute;lares
para el a&ntilde;o 2002. Los acuerdos alcanzados, que entraron
en vigor el uno de enero de 1995, representan el desarme arancelario
m&aacute;s importante de la historia. </P>
<P>
Los logros en el cap&iacute;tulo agr&iacute;cola de la Ronda Uruguay
suponen nuevas oportunidades para los pa&iacute;ses exportadores
de productos agr&iacute;colas, entre ellos los del Cono Sur. Las
nuevas reglas favorecen la recuperaci&oacute;n de mercados perdidos
a partir de la reducci&oacute;n de los subsidios a la exportaci&oacute;n
que deber&aacute;n emprender principalmente la UE y EEUU. No obstante,
es preciso matizar que el impacto de la liberalizaci&oacute;n
acordada en materia agr&iacute;cola no ser&aacute; perceptible
en relaci&oacute;n a las ventas de la subregi&oacute;n a la UE,
aunque s&iacute; lo ser&aacute; en relaci&oacute;n a las ventas
al resto del mundo. Por su parte, el Grupo Cairns, que fue fundado
en 1986, antes del comienzo de la Ronda Uruguay y que agrupa en
su seno a 14 pa&iacute;ses exportadores agr&iacute;colas -entre
ellos Argentina, Brasil, Chile y Uruguay- anunci&oacute; en Marrakech
que seguir&aacute; en funcionamiento con el objeto de promover
una mayor liberalizaci&oacute;n del mercado mundial de productos
agr&iacute;colas. En su opini&oacute;n los resultados alcanzados
son insuficientes, aunque los considera un paso hacia la liberalizaci&oacute;n
total (el Grupo Cairns planteaba una eliminaci&oacute;n total
de las barreras arancelarias y no arancelarias y la anulaci&oacute;n
de las subvenciones a las exportaciones, es decir, una reducci&oacute;n
del 90% frente al 36% alcanzado). </P>
<P>
Los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur son, adem&aacute;s, importantes
exportadores de productos textiles. El ingreso de estos productos
en el mercado europeo ha estado protegido por el Acuerdo Multifibras,
que ha regulado durante muchos a&ntilde;os las exportaciones de
textiles de Argentina, Brasil y Uruguay a contingentes negociados
bilateralmente. Al respecto, el Acta Final incluye importantes
recortes de aranceles en el comercio mundial de estos productos
y, lo que es muy importante, la abolici&oacute;n del Acuerdo Multifibras
en diez a&ntilde;os. La liberalizaci&oacute;n del comercio textil
tambi&eacute;n favorece las corrientes comerciales de Chile y
Paraguay hacia la UE. </P>
<P>
<B>Estructura del comercio entre la UE y los pa&iacute;ses del
Cono Sur</B> </P>
<P>
Ya se ha dicho que el comercio entre la UE y los pa&iacute;ses
del Cono Sur presenta como una de sus caracter&iacute;sticas la
concentraci&oacute;n en una limitada gama de productos. Las otras
dos caracter&iacute;sticas de esta relaci&oacute;n comercial son
la asimetr&iacute;a y la falta de diversificaci&oacute;n de las
exportaciones. La asimetr&iacute;a resulta de la desigual importancia
relativa que para una y otra regi&oacute;n tiene el comercio que
la una realiza con la otra. As&iacute;, la importancia relativa
del Cono Sur en el comercio exterior de la UE es escasa, representando
actualmente alrededor del 2,5% del volumen total de importaciones
de la UE y el 2% de las exportaciones totales de la UE al mundo.
En sentido inverso, para el Cono Sur la UE es el primer socio
comercial. </P>
<P>
La falta de diversificaci&oacute;n de las exportaciones del Cono
Sur ha servido de argumento a la UE para justificar la escasa
relevancia de las importaciones europeas procedentes de aquella
subregi&oacute;n. Si bien es verdad que las exportaciones del
Cono Sur presentan una escasa diversificaci&oacute;n, tambi&eacute;n
lo es que cada vez que los productores del Cono Sur han intentado
explorar las posibilidades de penetraci&oacute;n en el mercado
europeo se han encontrado con obst&aacute;culos que han ido en
aumento a medida que los productos adquieren mayor valor a&ntilde;adido<a href="#2">(2)</a>. Adem&aacute;s, en el an&aacute;lisis de esta cuesti&oacute;n
se debe tener en cuenta que las exportaciones de productos industriales
de la subregi&oacute;n -excepto los de Brasil- no son competitivas,
lo cual sin duda constituye un impedimento dif&iacute;cil de superar
a corto plazo para avanzar hacia una mayor diversificaci&oacute;n
de las exportaciones. </P>
<P>
Los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur han sido hist&oacute;ricamente
el principal destino de las exportaciones de la CE y lugar de
origen de la mayor&iacute;a de las importaciones comunitarias
procedentes de Am&eacute;rica Latina. Para apreciar la relevancia
que reviste el Cono Sur en el contexto del comercio interregional,
basta con se&ntilde;alar que solamente Argentina, Brasil y Chile
absorben m&aacute;s de las tres cuartas partes de las exportaciones
de la UE hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina. De igual manera, Brasil,
Argentina y M&eacute;xico son los destinos m&aacute;s importantes
de productos europeos en Am&eacute;rica Latina. Por otro lado,
la mayor&iacute;a de las importaciones europeas tambi&eacute;n
se originan en los mismos cuatro pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos,
que representan m&aacute;s del 80% del total de las exportaciones
totales latinoamericanas a Europa. Los Estados miembros de la
UE de donde proceden la mayor&iacute;a de estas exportaciones
son Alemania, Italia, Francia, Espa&ntilde;a, el Reino Unido y
Pa&iacute;ses Bajos. Las exportaciones latinoamericanas se dirigen
tambi&eacute;n principalmente al mismo grupo de pa&iacute;ses
europeos. </P>
<P>
Los cuatro pa&iacute;ses que integran el MERCOSUR dirigen el 27%
de sus exportaciones a la UE, el 17% a Estados Unidos y el 5%
a Jap&oacute;n. Asimismo, de las importaciones totales del bloque
sudamericano, el 26% proviene de la UE, el 23% de Estados Unidos
y el 5% de Jap&oacute;n. El componente excluyente de las exportaciones
del Cono Sur a la UE se refleja en los siguientes datos: el 60%
las exportaciones totales pertenece al sector agr&iacute;cola.
De hecho, el MERCOSUR es hoy el primer socio agr&iacute;cola de
la UE, incluso por encima de EEUU. El resto de las exportaciones
est&aacute; compuesto por bienes manufacturados (11,4%), materias
primas minerales (10%), maquinaria y material de transporte (8,2%),
productos qu&iacute;micos ( 3,8% ) y del sector de la confecci&oacute;n
y del calzado (3,6%). </P>
<P>
La subregi&oacute;n ha tenido super&aacute;vit tradicionalmente
en sus relaciones comerciales con la UE (durante el per&iacute;odo
1985-1992 el super&aacute;vit de los pa&iacute;ses que forman
el MERCOSUR alcanz&oacute; 46.000 millones de d&oacute;lares).
No obstante, a partir de 1990, gracias a las facilidades concedidas
al ingreso de productos extranjeros en los programas de liberalizaci&oacute;n
comercial en el Cono Sur, se ha provocado un incremento de las
exportaciones europeas hacia la subregi&oacute;n y en consecuencia,
entre 1993 y 1994 el super&aacute;vit del Cono Sur fue marcadamente
inferior al registrado a principios de la d&eacute;cada, y entre
1992 y 1993 las exportaciones de la UE hacia el MERCOSUR se incrementaron
en un 39%. Por otro lado, la fuerte reducci&oacute;n de las importaciones
europeas de productos latinoamericanos ha sido provocada en buena
medida por la recesi&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica que atraviesan
los Estados miembros de la UE. </P>
<P>
Las importaciones comunitarias procedentes de Brasil representan
m&aacute;s de la tercera parte del total de Am&eacute;rica Latina.
Al mismo tiempo, Brasil es el segundo destinatario de las exportaciones
de la UE a la regi&oacute;n, despu&eacute;s de M&eacute;xico.
En Brasil se origina el mayor d&eacute;ficit comercial de la UE
en sus relaciones con la regi&oacute;n. Para Brasil, la UE es
el destino m&aacute;s importante de sus exportaciones. En la d&eacute;cada
de los ochenta, Brasil se convirti&oacute; en el principal socio
comercial de la CE en la regi&oacute;n, desplazando a Argentina
de su tradicional posici&oacute;n de socio privilegiado. Pese
a que Brasil cuenta con una industria diversificada y competitiva,
m&aacute;s de la mitad de las importaciones que la UE obtiene
de Brasil se refieren a productos agr&iacute;colas y casi el 15%
a productos de la miner&iacute;a. Aproximadamente el 60% de los
productos manufacturados y m&aacute;s del 50% de los productos
agrarios que la UE compra en Am&eacute;rica Latina proceden de
Brasil. Asimismo, el 7% de las importaciones agr&iacute;colas
totales de la UE y un 6% de sus importaciones de minerales tambi&eacute;n
proceden de Brasil. Adem&aacute;s de productos tradicionales como
el caf&eacute; y los minerales, Brasil tambi&eacute;n exporta
a la UE maquinaria y material de transporte. En sentido inverso,
del total importado por Brasil desde la UE, m&aacute;s de la mitad
pertenece a los rubros de maquinaria y equipos de transporte,
el 17% a productos qu&iacute;micos y casi el 20% a otras manufacturas<a href="#3">(3)</a>. La competencia de Brasil tambi&eacute;n es importante en
los mercados mundiales de cacao y autom&oacute;vil, siendo adem&aacute;s
un fuerte competidor de la UE en sectores como el textil y el
c&aacute;rnico. </P>
<P>
En el caso de Argentina, los productos agropecuarios representan
m&aacute;s del 80% del total de sus ventas al mercado europeo
(soja y derivados, maiz, girasol y carne bovina de alta calidad).
En estos &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os se ha observado un incremento
de las importaciones de la UE de carne bovina procedente de Argentina,
lo cual se explica por los cambios producidos a partir de la conclusi&oacute;n
de la Ronda Uruguay y las modificaciones introducias en la PAC,
que persiguen la eliminaci&oacute;n de stocks y subsidios. Por
su parte, las manufacturas industriales representan m&aacute;s
del 80% de las exportaciones totales europeas al mercado argentino
(un 50% lo constituyen m&aacute;quinas y material de transporte).
</P>
<P>
La participaci&oacute;n de Uruguay y Paraguay en los intercambios
comerciales de la UE con Am&eacute;rica Latina reviste escasa
importancia: la UE s&oacute;lo adquiere de Uruguay el 1,5% del
total importado en Am&eacute;rica Latina y hacia Uruguay destina
el 2% de lo que exporta a la regi&oacute;n. Por su parte, las
importaciones de la UE desde Paraguay representan tan s&oacute;lo
alrededor del 1% del total, y hacia Paraguay se dirige algo menos
que el 1% de las exportaciones europeas hacia la regi&oacute;n.
Esto es debido fundamentalmente a la enorme influencia que ejercen
Brasil y Argentina en el comercio exterior de ambos pa&iacute;ses
sudamericanos. No obstante, para Uruguay y Paraguay la UE es el
segundo mercado en importancia, despu&eacute;s del de Am&eacute;rica
Latina. </P>
<P>
M&aacute;s del 90% de las ventas desde la UE a Uruguay corresponden
al sector industrial, mientras que las ventas uruguayas a la UE
en un 78% pertenecen al sector agropecuario y se componen fundamentalmente
de carne fresca y congelada, hiladuras, confecci&oacute;n no textil,
pieles, manufacturas de cuero, art&iacute;culos de peleteria y
piedras preciosas y semipreciosas. A diferencia de los dem&aacute;s
pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur, las principales importaciones paraguayas
procedentes de la UE no son los productos industriales, sino alimentos
y bebidas (alrededor de un 30%). Las m&aacute;quinas y material
de transporte representan el 29%, los productos qu&iacute;micos
alrededor del 18% y diversos productos manufacturados el 15%.
Las exportaciones paraguayas hacia la UE est&aacute;n constituidas
en un 89% por materias primas de origen agropecuario (madera,
aceites, carne bovina y textiles). Desde que la UE se convirti&oacute;
en un importante comprador de semillas, aceites vegetales y tortas
oleaginosas para alimento de animales, las exportaciones paraguayas
de productos oleaginosos al mercado europeo se han incrementado.
</P>
<P>
Chile apuntala su comercio exterior de la siguiente manera: a
la UE dirige el 30%, a Asia-Pac&iacute;fico el 30%, a Am&eacute;rica
Latina el 20% y al TLC el 20%<a href="#4">(4)</a>. En sentido inverso, la UE,
que en d&eacute;cadas pasadas hab&iacute;a sido el principal abastecedor
de las importaciones chilenas, ha perdido posiciones en la d&eacute;cada
actual, situ&aacute;ndose en tercer lugar despu&eacute;s de Am&eacute;rica
Latina y Estados Unidos. Entre 1985 y 1990, se ha registrado un
aumento importante de la participaci&oacute;n de Chile en las
importaciones de la UE. El grueso de las ventas de la UE hacia
Chile est&aacute;n constituidas por productos manufacturados (algo
m&aacute;s del 90%). El principal producto de exportaci&oacute;n
chileno hacia la UE es el cobre y sus derivados (alrededor de
un 50%). Asimismo, Chile ha sido uno de los pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos
que ha encarado con &eacute;xito una diversificaci&oacute;n de
las exportaciones al mercado europeo en productos manufacturados
y alimenticios, como fruta fresca, minerales met&aacute;licos,
fruta seca, productos del mar, harina y aceite de pescado, oro
y plata, celulosa, productos qu&iacute;micos, maderas, productos
agropecuarios, lanas y productos agroindustriales. </P>
<P>
<B>El SPG: una dudosa eficacia para el Cono Sur</B> </P>
<P>
Ning&uacute;n pa&iacute;s del Cono Sur ha recibido, hasta el momento,
un tratamiento preferencial en materia de comercio. El Sistema
de Preferencias Generalizadas (SPG) es el &uacute;nico esquema
de concesiones arancelarias que la CE ha adoptado en sus relaciones
comerciales con los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina a partir
de 1974. Por el mismo, los PVD pueden exportar sus productos hacia
la UE benefici&aacute;ndose de una reducci&oacute;n total o parcial
de los derechos de aduana. Cabe se&ntilde;alar que casi todos
los productos afectados por la PAC est&aacute;n excluidos del
esquema. En el sector industrial, las franquicias arancelarias
totales se aplican a productos industriales semiacabados y manufacturados,
con excepci&oacute;n de los productos textiles, inclu&iacute;dos
en el Acuerdo Multifibras. No obstante, el ingreso de productos
industriales que supuestamente est&aacute;n cubiertos por el SPG
ha estado sujeto a mecanismos de contingentaci&oacute;n arancelaria
adoptados por la UE para proteger los productos considerados sensibles,
y a l&iacute;mites cuantitativos m&aacute;ximos. En consecuencia,
una vez que los l&iacute;mites son sobrepasados, se restablecen
autom&aacute;ticamente los derechos aduaneros. </P>
<P>
La utilizaci&oacute;n del SPG ha sido m&aacute;s importante en
los casos de Brasil, Chile y Uruguay, que por parte de Argentina
y Paraguay. Si bien el SPG ha sido presentado por la UE como un
gesto en favor del incremento de las relaciones comerciales, la
efectividad del esquema se ha visto frecuentemente eclipsada por
varias causas. En primer lugar, desde el punto de vista t&eacute;cnico,
se trata de un mecanismo extremadamente complejo, lo cual no favorece
su efectiva utilizaci&oacute;n por parte de los exportadores.
Por otro lado, la adopci&oacute;n de medidas para-arancelarias
y el car&aacute;cter discrecional y aut&oacute;nomo del SPG tampoco
han proporcionado los resultados esperados. No obstante, en el
caso de Brasil, el auge de sus exportaciones hacia la UE se ha
visto favorecido por una eficaz utilizaci&oacute;n del SPG, siendo
el PVD que, despu&eacute;s de China, ha obtenido mayor provecho
de las ventajas del esquema. Argentina, en cambio, siempre ha
tenido el mismo problema: los principales productos de exportaci&oacute;n
agropecuarios est&aacute;n excluidos del SPG. Las exportaciones
uruguayas de productos agr&iacute;colas -que representan la gran
mayor&iacute;a del volumen y valor del total de las exportaciones-
s&oacute;lo se beneficiaron con un 40%, frente a un 95% para los
productos industriales (las exportaciones industriales uruguayas
a la UE revisten escasa importancia). La utilizaci&oacute;n del
SPG por parte de Chile se ha incrementado en la d&eacute;cada
actual, y en el caso de Paraguay ha mejorado en lo que respecta
a los productos industriales. </P>
<P>
Actualmente est&aacute; por aplicarse una reforma del SPG con
el prop&oacute;sito de ampliar la lista de productos, simplificar
el sistema, eliminando l&iacute;mites cuantitativos, y prolongar
los per&iacute;odos de aplicaci&oacute;n del esquema, adem&aacute;s
de adoptar medidas en favor de los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios
menos desarrollados. Asimismo, el MERCOSUR podr&iacute;a verse
beneficiado por una medida, que ya ha sido aplicada a otros procesos
de integraci&oacute;n, que establece una mayor flexibilidad respecto
a las reglas de origen de productos permitiendo una acumulaci&oacute;n
subregional. </P>
<P>
<B>Inversiones europeas en el Cono Sur</B> </P>
<P>
La UE ha sido, hist&oacute;ricamente, un importante inversor para
Am&eacute;rica Latina en general y para los pa&iacute;ses del
Cono Sur en particular. Efectivamente, la UE constituye -a la
par de Estados Unidos-, la fuente m&aacute;s importante de inversi&oacute;n
extranjera directa (IED). Concretamente, las cifras actuales revelan
que el 47% de las IED radicadas en el MERCOSUR provienen de la
UE, el 42% de EEUU y el 11% de Jap&oacute;n. A su vez, los pa&iacute;ses
del Cono Sur son, desde los a&ntilde;os ochenta, el principal
destino de la IED europea (m&aacute;s del 80% ha tenido como destino
a los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur y a los pa&iacute;ses que integran
el Grupo de los Tres). De hecho, en los &uacute;ltimos cuatro
a&ntilde;os, Argentina y Brasil recibieron 60.000 millones de
d&oacute;lares en concepto de IED. </P>
<P>
La inversi&oacute;n procedente de la UE y Estados Unidos en el
MERCOSUR fue pr&aacute;cticamente excluyente entre 1980 y 1991,
representando entre ambas potencias aproximadamente el 90% del
total de inversi&oacute;n extranjera. El importante crecimiento
de inversi&oacute;n que se verifica en los a&ntilde;os noventa
tiene que ver con el buen posicionamiento que han adquirido las
econom&iacute;as emergentes del Cono Sur. La presencia de la inversi&oacute;n
europea es m&aacute;s importante en Argentina, Brasil y Chile
que en otros pa&iacute;ses de Latinoam&eacute;rica. </P>
<P>
Dentro de la UE, Gran Breta&ntilde;a, Alemania, Espa&ntilde;a
y Francia son los pa&iacute;ses que dirigen mayores flujos de
IED hacia el Cono Sur. En el per&iacute;odo 1979-1992, Gran Breta&ntilde;a
represent&oacute; la principal fuente de IED dirigida a Argentina,
Brasil y Chile, mientras que Espa&ntilde;a lo fue para Uruguay.
A su vez, en Argentina y Chile debe tenerse en cuenta la importante
presencia de la IED proveniente de Espa&ntilde;a, en el caso de
Brasil la IED originada en Alemania y en Uruguay la IED proveniente
de Francia. </P>
<P>
En sentido inverso, a partir del cambio pol&iacute;tico y econ&oacute;mico
que se ha generalizado en el Cono Sur, se ha registrado un incremento
de los flujos de inversi&oacute;n desde la subregi&oacute;n, principalmente
procedentes de Brasil, hacia otros pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica
Latina y las regiones europea y norteamericana. Pese a que los
flujos de IED procedente de Argentina y Chile a&uacute;n son modestos,
actualmente se registra una importante presencia de inversiones
chilenas en Argentina y viceversa. Por &uacute;ltimo, cabe mencionar
la creciente utilizaci&oacute;n, por parte de los pa&iacute;ses
del Cono Sur, de los instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n creados
recientemente por la UE para la promoci&oacute;n de inversiones
conjuntas, tanto en el espacio europeo como en el latinoamericano.
</P>
<P>
<a name=coo></a><h3>La cooperaci&#243;n entre la UE y el Cono Sur</P></h3>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n -entendida como instrumento pol&iacute;tico
de ayuda al desarrollo- se convirti&oacute;, casi simult&aacute;neamente
con la creaci&oacute;n de la misma CE, en uno de los pilares de
la acci&oacute;n exterior europea para regir sus relaciones con
regiones extracomunitarias con problemas de desarrollo. Pero al
mismo tiempo la pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n europea
prioriz&oacute; en dos grupos de PVD -las antiguas colonias de
algunos Estados miembros de la CE agrupadas en el Acuerdo de Lom&eacute;
(pa&iacute;ses ACP) y los pa&iacute;ses de la cuenca mediterr&aacute;nea
(Magreb, Mashrek, Turqu&iacute;a y Chipre, entre otros)-, excluyendo
de ese esquema preferencial a Latinoam&eacute;rica y Asia. </P>
<P>
Por otro lado, tras el final de la Guerra Fr&iacute;a, la CE coloc&oacute;
a los PECOS en la c&uacute;spide de las relaciones preferenciales
extracomunitarias. La r&aacute;pida conclusi&oacute;n de los Acuerdos
Europeos, a inicios de los noventa, entre la UE y cada uno de
los pa&iacute;ses PECOS: Bulgaria, Hungria, Polonia, Rumania,
la Rep&uacute;blica Checa y Eslovaquia, es la prueba de ello.
En los Acuerdos Europeos se brind&oacute; un acceso preferencial
a las exportaciones de este grupo de pa&iacute;ses al MUE a trav&eacute;s
de la creaci&oacute;n de una zona de libre comercio para productos
industriales en el curso de los pr&oacute;ximos diez a&ntilde;os,
acompa&ntilde;ados por altos niveles de ayuda t&eacute;cnica y
financiera. </P>
<P>
A la hora de las definiciones, la CE no dud&oacute; en discriminar
a los pa&iacute;ses no asociados de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina
de sus originales reg&iacute;menes de cooperaci&oacute;n, debido,
fundamentalmente, a la falta de v&iacute;nculos especiales e intereses
espec&iacute;ficos en esas regiones. Entre una y otra forma de
cooperaci&oacute;n, la diferencia esencial radica en que mientras
que los pa&iacute;ses asociados cuentan con importantes instrumentos
y medios financieros como el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo (FED)
-integrado por aportes de los Estados miembros de la UE-, los
pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos est&aacute;n vinculados a la UE
por acuerdos no preferenciales y los recursos que reciben provienen
exclusivamente del presupuesto comunitario. </P>
<P>
Si bien se da por sentado que la cooperaci&oacute;n comunitaria
hacia los no asociados fue instituida a partir de 1976, la realidad
es que en ese a&ntilde;o se decidi&oacute; otorgar a estos pa&iacute;ses
la primera partida presupuestaria (20 millones de ECU) con car&aacute;cter
ad hoc en el marco de la Ayuda Financiera y T&eacute;cnica. En
ese mismo a&ntilde;o, la Comisi&oacute;n transmiti&oacute; al
reticente Consejo una propuesta con el fin de reglamentar la aplicaci&oacute;n
de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo en favor de los Pa&iacute;ses
en V&iacute;as de Dasarrollo de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina(PVD/ALA).
El visto bueno del Consejo a la proposici&oacute;n de la Comisi&oacute;n
se hizo esperar cuatro a&ntilde;os por la falta de unanimidad.
Finalmente, en el reglamento aprobado en 1981 se institucionaliz&oacute;
definitivamente la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo hacia Am&eacute;rica
Latina. Este tipo de cooperaci&oacute;n consiste b&aacute;sicamente
en la transferencia de recursos financieros y conocimientos t&eacute;cnicos
a los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s necesitados de la regi&oacute;n
y se manifiesta, fundamentalmente, a trav&eacute;s de la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Financiera y T&eacute;cnica, la Ayuda Alimentaria y el apoyo a
acciones de las Organizaciones No Gubernamentales (ONG). </P>
<P>
<B>Reformulaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n europea</B> </P>
<P>
En los a&ntilde;os ochenta, la CE implement&oacute; deliberadamente
una serie de modificaciones en los mecanismos de cooperaci&oacute;n
hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina, con el prop&oacute;sito de ejercer
una mayor y mejor influencia en la regi&oacute;n. En junio de
1987 se lanzaron las Nuevas Orientaciones de la UE para las Relaciones
con Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia, cuya novedad m&aacute;s importante
es el establecimiento de una nueva modalidad de cooperaci&oacute;n
en los sectores industrial y cient&iacute;fico-tecnol&oacute;gico.
La creciente atenci&oacute;n de la CE hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina
tambi&eacute;n propici&oacute; una resoluci&oacute;n del pleno
del Parlamento Europeo, el 27 de octubre de 1988, sobre la Cooperaci&oacute;n
entre la UE y los PVD-ALA. Se estaba perfilando, as&iacute;, una
nueva estrategia para el establecimiento de una cooperaci&oacute;n
que pone &eacute;nfasis en fomentar una relaci&oacute;n entre
pares. El nuevo clima de entendimiento interregional se vio redimensionado
con la aparici&oacute;n, en 1990, de las Orientaciones para la
Cooperaci&oacute;n con los PVD-ALA que establecieron una ampliaci&oacute;n
y profundizaci&oacute;n de los instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n
europeos y sirvieron de fundamento para la inauguraci&oacute;n
de una nueva trayectoria en las relaciones bilaterales entre la
UE y cada uno de los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina, a
trav&eacute;s de la conclusi&oacute;n de acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n
de tercera generaci&oacute;n (ATG)<a href="#5">(5)</a>. </P>
<P>
Esta nueva modalidad de cooperaci&oacute;n se ha visto fortalecida
por el Reglamento del Consejo del 25 de febrero de 1992. El Reglamento
443/92 tiene trascendental importancia, ya que en el mismo se
codificaron los nuevos postulados de la cooperaci&oacute;n. A
diferencia del marco jur&iacute;dico precedente, donde no exist&iacute;a
ninguna referencia a los aspectos pol&iacute;ticos, el Reglamento
dispone en su art&iacute;culo primero la importancia que para
la CE reviste la promoci&oacute;n de los Derechos Humanos y la
democratizaci&oacute;n. Se establece as&iacute; una especie de
condicionalidad pol&iacute;tica para el desarrollo armonioso de
la cooperaci&oacute;n. El Reglamento estipula que la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Econ&oacute;mica se basa en el mutuo inter&eacute;s entre la CE
y Am&eacute;rica Latina, siendo sus principales objetivos mejorar
el entorno econ&oacute;mico de los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica
Latina, estimulando un clima de confianza, alentando al desarrollo
del comercio y las inversiones, adem&aacute;s de incrementar la
competitividad de las empresas locales, especialmente las Peque&ntilde;as
y Medianas Empresas (PYME). Espec&iacute;ficamente, en el Reglamento
se establece que las &aacute;reas prioritarias de la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Econ&oacute;mica son: mejora del potencial cient&iacute;fico-tecnol&oacute;gico
y del entorno econ&oacute;mico, social y cultural mediante actividades
de formaci&oacute;n y de transferencia de conocimientos t&eacute;cnicos;
mejora del apoyo institucional -sobre todo de las instituciones
de integraci&oacute;n, acompa&ntilde;ado por una intensificaci&oacute;n
del di&aacute;logo con los interlocutores latinoamericanos m&aacute;s
destacados, siendo los entornos econ&oacute;mico, legislativo,
reglamentario y social m&aacute;s propicios al desarrollo; y ayuda
a empresas por medio de acciones de promoci&oacute;n comercial,
formaci&oacute;n y asisitencia t&eacute;cnica, a trav&eacute;s
del establecimiento de contactos entre empresas. </P>
<P>
Pese al nuevo impulso que la UE ha dado a la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Econ&oacute;mica, es preciso se&ntilde;alar que la prioridad para
la UE en materia de cooperaci&oacute;n con Am&eacute;rica Latina
contin&uacute;a siendo la Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo. En
este sentido, cabe subrayar que los recursos presupuestarios comunitarios
destinados a la Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo para Am&eacute;rica
Latina han experimentado un crecimiento sostenido a partir de
1980; sobre el total de los recursos asignados a Am&eacute;rica
Latina en materia de cooperaci&oacute;n durante el per&iacute;odo
1980-1992, el 86% correspondi&oacute; a la Cooperaci&oacute;n
al Desarrollo. Entre 1992 y 1993 los fondos presupuestarios para
la Cooperaci&oacute;n T&eacute;cnica y Financiera con Am&eacute;rica
Latina registraron un aumento del 10%, pasando de 152 millones
de ECU a 168 millones ECU, respectivamente. Dentro de Am&eacute;rica
Latina, los principales beneficiarios de la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Financiera y T&eacute;cnica son los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica
Central y los pa&iacute;ses del Grupo Andino, mientras que los
pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur &uacute;ltimamente han sido pr&aacute;cticamente
excluidos en proyectos de este tipo, benefici&aacute;ndose s&oacute;lo
de las partidas presupuestarias asignadas a la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Econ&oacute;mica. </P>
<P>
<B>Sectores prioritarios de la cooperaci&oacute;n UE-Cono Sur</B>

<P>
Los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur se encuentran entre los principales
receptores de la Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica instrumentada
por la UE para fortalecer sus v&iacute;nculos con los PVD que
acreditan un mayor potencial de crecimiento. La Cooperaci&oacute;n
Econ&oacute;mica de la UE con los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur se
cristaliza a trav&eacute;s de los ATG y la puesta en pr&aacute;ctica
de un amplio instrumental que busca fortalecer las relaciones
empresariales entre ambas partes<a href="#6">(6)</a>. Tambi&eacute;n se enmarcan
dentro de este tipo de cooperaci&oacute;n la ejecuci&oacute;n
de una serie de programas -algunos de los cuales ya ven&iacute;an
funcionando con anterioridad a la reformulaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n
europea respecto de Latinoam&eacute;rica- a nivel interregional,
regional, subregional y bilateral en sectores en las que ambas
partes tienen especial inter&eacute;s, tales como el cient&iacute;fico-tecnol&oacute;gico<a href="#7">(7)</a>, lucha contra la droga<a href="#8">(8)</a>, y la cooperaci&oacute;n medioambiental<a href="#9">(9)</a>. </P>
<P>
Aunque la asignaci&oacute;n de recursos a este tipo de cooperaci&oacute;n
es modesta, hay que reconocer que en poco tiempo se ha dado un
salto cualitativo importante en cuanto a los instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n
europea hacia Latinoam&eacute;rica. Tomando como referencia el
1993, a&ntilde;o en el que se destinaron 46,6 millones de ECU
a la financiaci&oacute;n de 84 proyectos sobre Cooperaci&oacute;n
Econ&oacute;mica en Am&eacute;rica Latina, 13 millones de ECU
se dirigieron a los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica del Sur y
23 millones de ECU se dedicaron a proyectos regionales de los
cuales se benefician los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur. El resto
se distribuy&oacute; de la siguiente manera: 9,7 millones de ECU
hacia Am&eacute;rica Central, incluyendo a Cuba y M&eacute;xico.
En el mismo a&ntilde;o, la UE asign&oacute; 31,2 millones de ECU
distribuidos en una l&iacute;nea para la financiaci&oacute;n de
co-inversiones y otra para los acuerdos de tercera generaci&oacute;n,
adem&aacute;s de dos programas de cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fico-tecnol&oacute;gica.
</P>
<P>
Entre 1990 y 1993 la UE concluy&oacute; ATG con todos los pa&iacute;ses
del Cono Sur, adoptando, por un lado, una f&oacute;rmula com&uacute;n
para todos ellos y, por otro, adoptando instrumentos espec&iacute;ficos
en funci&oacute;n del &aacute;rea de cooperaci&oacute;n que la
UE ha considerado &uacute;til enfatizar en su relaci&oacute;n
con cada pa&iacute;s beneficiario. El establecimiento de una cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica es la raz&oacute;n de ser de estos acuerdos,
que gen&eacute;ricamente abarca la cooperaci&oacute;n comercial,
industrial, la promoci&oacute;n de inversiones, la constituci&oacute;n
de empresas conjuntas, la formaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos
y el desarrollo de programas sobre ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a.
Como una novedad, los acuerdos incorporan una cl&aacute;usula
democr&aacute;tica cuyo fundamento es condicionar la continuidad
de la cooperaci&oacute;n a la vigencia de la democracia y el respeto
de los Derechos Humanos, y una cl&aacute;usula evolutiva que establece
la posibilidad de ampliar la gama de la cooperaci&oacute;n, a
nuevos sectores. Una comisi&oacute;n mixta de cooperaci&oacute;n,
compuesta por representantes de la UE y del pa&iacute;s beneficiario,
velar&aacute; por el buen funcionamiento de los acuerdos y examinar&aacute;
todas las cuestiones derivadas de su aplicaci&oacute;n. Todos
los ATG tienen una vigencia de cinco a&ntilde;os prorrogables
anualmente siempre que ninguna de las partes lo denuncie seis
meses antes de su vencimiento. </P>
<P>
La firma de un Acuerdo de Pesca entre la UE y Argentina, en marzo
de 1994, es el logro m&aacute;s importante alcanzado en el &aacute;mbito
de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica bilateral entre UE y
un pa&iacute;s del Cono Sur. Este acuerdo de segunda generaci&oacute;n
es el &uacute;nico en su tipo que se ha alcanzado como proyecci&oacute;n
de la cl&aacute;usula evolutiva contenida en los ATG. El prop&oacute;sito
de este acuerdo que tiene una vigencia de cinco a&ntilde;os es
reglamentar la explotaci&oacute;n de la pesca de pa&iacute;ses
europeos en aguas jurisdiccionales argentinas, previ&eacute;ndose
capturas de 250.000 toneladas anuales de distintas especies, correspondiendo
120.000 a la cotizada merluza hubbsi, muy abundante en los mares
del Atl&aacute;ntico Sur. El Acuerdo concede ayuda financiera
de la UE para los distintos tipos de sociedades a crearse (mixtas,
de capital europeo definitiva o temporalmente establecido en Argentina
), y tambi&eacute;n prev&eacute; una ayuda financiera en concepto
de capital de funcionamiento al armador argentino integrante de
una de estas empresas. Por el Acuerdo, la UE abrir&aacute; contingentes
anuales de importaci&oacute;n de productos de pesca argentinos
con arancel reducido para abastecimiento del mercado europeo.
Adem&aacute;s, el Acuerdo establece la cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral
en materia cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica con el objeto de
promover la conservaci&oacute;n y explotaci&oacute;n racional
de los recursos y el desarrollo equilibrado del sector de la pesca<a href="#10">(10)</a>. </P>
<P>
Por &uacute;ltimo, cabe decir que la apertura de delegaciones
permanentes de la Comisi&oacute;n Europea en cuatro capitales
de los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur constituye un hecho altamente
positivo que ha contribuido a reafirmar los v&iacute;nculos institucionales
que se hab&iacute;an gestado anteriormente, cuando los pa&iacute;ses
del Cono Sur instalaron en Bruselas misiones diplo-m&aacute;ticas.
En la actualidad Brasilia, Buenos Aires, Montevideo y Santiago
cuentan con delegaciones de la Comisi&oacute;n Europea. Adem&aacute;s
de ejercer la representaci&oacute;n oficial de la UE, las delegaciones
sirven de enlace en el desarrollo de las relaciones bilaterales,
realizan actividades vinculadas a la gesti&oacute;n y seguimiento
de la cooperaci&oacute;n hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina y patrocinan
conferencias, seminarios y encuentros interregionales destinados
a dar a conocer en Am&eacute;rica Latina las oportunidades de
incrementar el comercio y las inversiones entre ambas regiones.
</P>
<P>
<B>La AOD bilateral hacia los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur</B> </P>
<P>
La Ayuda Oficial al Desarrollo (AOD) -que cada pa&iacute;s de
la UE otorga en su calidad de miembro del Comit&eacute; de Ayuda
al Desarrollo (CAD-UE)- es complementaria pero a la vez aut&oacute;noma
de la cooperaci&oacute;n otorgada en el marco de la Comisi&oacute;n
Europea. La decisi&oacute;n sobre la asignaci&oacute;n de AOD
bilateral corresponde a cada Estado miembro de la UE. Si se compara
la AOD bilateral con la cooperaci&oacute;n originada en el presupuesto
de la UE, se observa que la primera es mucho m&aacute;s relevante.
Si bien los pa&iacute;ses con menor renta per c&aacute;pita se
erigen como los principales beneficiarios de la AOD, en su asignaci&oacute;n
tambi&eacute;n influye la importancia de las relaciones pol&iacute;ticas
y comerciales que algunos Estados miembros de la UE mantienen
con los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s avanzados de Am&eacute;rica Latina.
De ah&iacute; que la AOD bilateral destinada por el CAD-UE a los
cuatro pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR en el per&iacute;odo 1980-1992
haya alcanzado importantes cifras, la cual, sumada a la asignada
por la Comisi&oacute;n Europea en el mismo per&iacute;odo, represent&oacute;
el 75,1% del total de AOD procedente de los Estados miembros del
CAD. Argentina y Brasil fueron los dos pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s
beneficiados de la subregi&oacute;n, habiendo recibido entre 1980
y 1992 el 11% y el 9,1%, respectivamente, del total de la AOD
bilateral de la UE hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina. Paraguay y Uruguay,
en cambio, s&oacute;lo han recibido en el mismo per&iacute;odo
el 1,9% y el 1,7%, respectivamente. </P>
<P>
Alemania es, con diferencia, el principal donante de AOD europea
dirigida al MERCOSUR, habiendo aportado el 30,5% del total recibido
por la subregi&oacute;n en el per&iacute;odo 1980-1992. Asimismo,
Italia se destaca como el segundo pa&iacute;s en importancia por
sus aportaciones de AOD a la subregi&oacute;n (19,9% de toda la
ayuda en el per&iacute;odo 1980-1992 ). El MERCOSUR tambi&eacute;n
recibe una proporci&oacute;n importante de AOD de otros pa&iacute;ses
europeos como Espa&ntilde;a, Francia y Pa&iacute;ses Bajos. En
1992, la cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral dirigida por la UE y Jap&oacute;n
a la subregi&oacute;n se ha incrementado sustancialmente en t&eacute;rminos
relativos, mientras que, en el caso de Estados Unidos, se ha registrado
un importante retroceso debido, fundamentalmente, a la pronunciada
reducci&oacute;n de su cooperaci&oacute;n con Brasil. </P>
<P>
<a name=aug></a><h3>El auge de los v&#237;nculos pol&#237;ticos interregionales</h3>
</P>
<P>
Las democracias instaladas en el Cono Sur en los a&ntilde;os ochenta
atribuyeron particular relevancia a las relaciones con la UE,
coloc&aacute;ndolas en un lugar prioritario junto a las relaciones
con Estados Unidos y Am&eacute;rica Latina. A ello ha contribuido,
adem&aacute;s de los lazos hist&oacute;ricos y culturales que
unen a ambas regiones, el deseo de los pa&iacute;ses del Cono
Sur de revitalizar sus relaciones pol&iacute;ticas y econ&oacute;micas
con la UE y hallar en Europa un contrapeso a la hegemon&iacute;a
de Estados Unidos en la subregi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
Los a&ntilde;os ochenta fueron propicios para la intensificaci&oacute;n
de los v&iacute;nculos pol&iacute;ticos interregionales, objetivo
largamente anhelado por los latinoamericanos<a href="#11">(11)</a>. La CE comenz&oacute;
a manifestar su inter&eacute;s en un nuevo v&iacute;nculo con
Am&eacute;rica Latina. La mejora de las relaciones aparec&iacute;a
como una necesidad en concordancia con las aspiraciones de la
Comisi&oacute;n Europea sobre un mayor protagonismo internacional
y la formulaci&oacute;n de una politica exterior unificada. Para
ello, la CE deb&iacute;a proponerse no cometer atropellos para
atraer la atenci&oacute;n de una regi&oacute;n que hab&iacute;a
quedado resentida a partir de la actitud comunitaria en contra
de Argentina en el conflicto de las Malvinas de 1982. </P>
<P>
El momento era propicio para un acercamiento de la CE hacia Am&eacute;rica
Latina en dos planos diferentes: por un lado, tomando partido
en la crisis centroamericana que enfrentaba a Estados Unidos y
Nicaragua y, por el otro, mediante el apoyo a los procesos de
democratizaci&oacute;n iniciados en casi toda la regi&oacute;n
en los a&ntilde;os ochenta. La contribuci&oacute;n europea a la
pacificaci&oacute;n del conflicto en Centroam&eacute;rica result&oacute;
ser un &eacute;xito, ya que su participaci&oacute;n como moderador
y pacificador, y como potencia sin dimensi&oacute;n militar, favoreci&oacute;
el di&aacute;logo y la cooperaci&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
La otra vertiente del acercamiento de la CE a Am&eacute;rica Latina
est&aacute; vinculada a un proceso de maduraci&oacute;n de las
relaciones interregionales que se hab&iacute;a iniciado, como
ya se ha comentado, con un fortalecimiento de la cooperaci&oacute;n
que culmin&oacute; con el estable-cimiento de un di&aacute;logo
interregional entre la CE y el Grupo de R&iacute;o<a href="#12">(12)</a>. Espa&ntilde;a
cumpli&oacute; un rol protagnista en todo este proceso de acercamiento,
que se tradujo en una mayor sensibilizaci&oacute;n de las instituciones
comunitarias con respecto a Am&eacute;rica Latina. El cambio de
actitud comunitario se reflej&oacute; en estos hechos: en 1985
se cre&oacute; la cartera Norte-Sud, pasando a depender de esta
divisi&oacute;n las relaciones de la CE con Am&eacute;rica Latina,
&ccedil;sia y el Mediterr&aacute;neo. En esta misma l&iacute;nea,
los servicios de Am&eacute;rica Latina y &ccedil;sia, correspondientes
a la Direcci&oacute;n General VIII, fueron trasladados a la Direcci&oacute;n
General I para una mejor gesti&oacute;n. Tambi&eacute;n la Comisi&oacute;n
Europea alent&oacute;, a mediados de los a&ntilde;os ochenta,
la reanudaci&oacute;n de las reuniones de las comisiones mixtas
previstas en los acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n concluidos hasta
ese momento con pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos. Por &uacute;ltimo,
cabe destacar que la CE puso en pr&aacute;ctica una pol&iacute;tica
de. mayor acercamiento con organismos regionales latinoamericanos:
en 1989 la Comisi&oacute;n adquiri&oacute; estatuto de observador
en la Organizaci&oacute;n de Estados Americanos (OEA), a partir
de 1990 lo hizo en la ALADI, y en 1993 se vincul&oacute; con el
Sistema Econ&oacute;mico Latinoamericano (SELA), mediante la suscripci&oacute;n
de un acuerdo. </P>
<P>
La institucionalizaci&oacute;n del di&aacute;logo CE-Grupo de
R&iacute;o fue precedida por contactos informales entre representantes
de ambos lados, que se iniciaron en 1987 en el contexto de Asamblea
General de Naciones Unidas. El comisario Cheysson se mostr&oacute;
desde un principio favorable a una profundizaci&oacute;n de los
contactos pol&iacute;ticos entre la CE y el Grupo de R&iacute;o.
Los latinoamericanos, por su parte, presionaron para que se reconociera
al Grupo de R&iacute;o como un interlocutor v&aacute;lido, pero
la CE encontr&oacute; dificultades para su reconocimiento por
no considerarlo representativo de toda la regi&oacute;n. No obstante,
las negociaciones se iniciaron en Nueva York en septiembre de
1990, concluyendo con la celebraci&oacute;n de la Conferencia
de Roma el 20 de diciembre, en la que se institucionaliza el di&aacute;logo
interregional que hasta entonces no hab&iacute;a logrado afianzarse.
</P>
<P>
El di&aacute;logo UE-Grupo de R&iacute;o, en el que participan
todos los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur, ha posibilitado sentar las
bases de una nueva etapa de entendimiento rec&iacute;proco. En
su seno se discuten todos los temas, pol&iacute;ticos y econ&oacute;micos,
que ata&ntilde;en a las relaciones entre ambas regiones. La agenda
interregional es muy amplia y est&aacute; abierta al intercambio
de opiniones en cuestiones que van desde consideraciones de orden
pol&iacute;tico, como la consolidaci&oacute;n de la democracia
y el respeto de los Derechos Humanos, hasta aspectos de car&aacute;cter
econ&oacute;mico referidos a contenciosos comerciales, como la
utilizaci&oacute;n por parte de la UE de pr&aacute;cticas comerciales
que impiden el ingreso en el mercado europeo de productos de exportaci&oacute;n
latinoamericanos como, por ejemplo, los cereales y las carnes
procedentes de las zonas de clima templado del Cono Sur. </P>
<P>
Los resultados de este joven di&aacute;logo interregional se han
visto reflejados en proyectos de cooperaci&oacute;n en materia
de integraci&oacute;n y racionalizaci&oacute;n de la ad-ministraci&oacute;n
p&uacute;blica. En tal sentido, un logro importante es la implementaci&oacute;n,
por parte del Instituto de Administraci&oacute;n P&uacute;blica
(IEAP), de un proyecto para la transferencia de conocimientos
en materia de integraci&oacute;n regional -firmado el 28 de mayo
de 1992 por un total 1,7 millones de ECU- . Tambi&eacute;n en
1992 se desti-naron 3,2 millones de ECU a proyectos sobre promoci&oacute;n
comercial e industrial. Asimismo, en 1993 se destinaron 8,3 millones
de ECU a un proyecto relativo a actividades de formaci&oacute;n
del sector p&uacute;blico y privado e integraci&oacute;n regional
en los pa&iacute;ses del Grupo de R&iacute;o. </P>
<P>
El acceso de Am&eacute;rica Latina a los cr&eacute;ditos del Banco
Europeo de Inversiones (BEI), a partir de 1993, debe enmarcarse
tambi&eacute;n en el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n resultante
del di&aacute;logo UE-Grupo de R&iacute;o. Si bien se trata de
una instituci&oacute;n cuyo &aacute;mbito de actividad primordial
es la UE, el BEI tambi&eacute;n opera desde hace a&ntilde;os en
los pa&iacute;ses y regiones que tienen relaciones privilegiadas
con la UE. Con esta decisi&oacute;n en favor de Am&eacute;rica
Latina, la UE dio respuesta a una vieja aspiraci&oacute;n de los
pa&iacute;ses de la regi&oacute;n. Entre 1993 y 1999, el BEI ha
sido autorizado para ofrecer pr&eacute;stamos para la financiaci&oacute;n
de inversiones en Am&eacute;rica Latina hasta un total de 750
millo-nes de ECU. Los cr&eacute;ditos que concede la instituci&oacute;n
est&aacute;n dirigidos a proyectos concretos de inter&eacute;s
com&uacute;n para los pa&iacute;ses de ubicaci&oacute;n y para
la UE, con el objeto de financiar los elementos de activo fijo
de una inversi&oacute;n determinada. La institu-ci&oacute;n ha
sido autorizada a cooperar en la realizaci&oacute;n de proyectos
viables del sector p&uacute;blico o privado en infraestructura
econ&oacute;mica, industria, agroindustria, miner&iacute;a, energ&iacute;a
y turismo. Los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur, principalmente Argentina,
Brasil y Chile, se encuentran entre los que tienen mayores posibilidades
de acceder a los cr&eacute;ditos del BEI en proyectos que comprendan
la formaci&oacute;n de joint-ventures; proyectos con elevado contenido
de transferencia tecnol&oacute;gica; proyectos conducentes a estrechar
los v&iacute;nculos entre el Cono Sur y Europa en &aacute;reas
como telecomunicaciones y trans-porte; inversiones tendentes a
fomentar la integraci&oacute;n subregional, y proyectos que conlleven
mejoras ambientales como energ&iacute;as renovables o dispositivos
anticontaminantes. Sobre esto &uacute;ltimo, es importante se&ntilde;alar
que el BEI dedica especial atenci&oacute;n al medio ambiente.

<P>
<B>El MERCOSUR: una estrategia adecuada a las circunstancias actuales</B>
</P>
<P>
Por el Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n, firmado el 26 de marzo de 1991,
Argentina, Brasil, Paraguay y Uruguay se comprometieron a conformar
una zona de libre comercio y una uni&oacute;n aduanera que comenzar&iacute;a
a funcionar el uno de enero de 1995. Ese objetivo se cumpli&oacute;
en la fecha y de forma prevista, hoy por hoy el MERCOSUR es una
realidad. El proyecto MERCOSUR fue impulsado por Argentina y Brasil
para hacer un frente com&uacute;n que permitiera una mejor adaptaci&oacute;n
a las exigencias del sistema internacional actual, caracterizado
por la globalizaci&oacute;n de la econom&iacute;a. El MERCOSUR
representa el 54% del Producto Bruto de Am&eacute;rica Latina
y constituye el cuarto espacio econ&oacute;mico despu&eacute;s
de la UE, Estados Unidos y Jap&oacute;n. Se trata, sin duda, del
proceso m&aacute;s exitoso del Continente y el mejor posicionado
dentro los que actualmente tienen cabida entre las econom&iacute;as
emergentes. </P>
<P>
La formaci&oacute;n del MERCOSUR coincide con el lanzamiento de
propuestas similares en el resto del subcontinente como el Grupo
de los Tres (G-3) formado en 1990 por Colombia, M&eacute;xico
y Venezuela; y la reformulaci&oacute;n y reactivaci&oacute;n de
los procesos de integraci&oacute;n en marcha en la regi&oacute;n
como el Mercado Com&uacute;n Centroamericano (MCCA) , creado en
1960, y el Grupo Andino (GRAN), creado en 1969. Todos estos esquemas
de integraci&oacute;n presentan en com&uacute;n su apertura hacia
el exterior y el abandono del proteccionismo y el intervencionismo
estatal que hab&iacute;a caracterizado a las estrategias de integraci&oacute;n
en el pasado (v&eacute;ase IRELA: Integraci&oacute;n y cooperaci&oacute;n
en Am&eacute;rica Latina: Enfoques nuevos, esfuersos m&uacute;ltiples;
Dossier n&#186; 44; Madrid; marzo de 1993). </P>
<P>
El clima en favor de la revitalizaci&oacute;n de la integraci&oacute;n
en Am&eacute;rica Latina se ha visto fortalecido por la propuesta
hemisf&eacute;rica de la Iniciativa para las Am&eacute;ricas lanzada
por EEUU en junio de 1990 con el prop&oacute;sito de establecer
una zona de libre comercio continental. Asimismo, con la firma,
en octubre de 1992, del TLC entre EEUU, Canad&aacute; y M&eacute;xico,
y la posible incorporaci&oacute;n de otros pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos
en ese proceso constituye un hecho trascendente en las relaciones
entre la gran potencia del Norte y Latinoam&eacute;rica. En esa
misma direcci&oacute;n, en la Cumbre de las Am&eacute;ricas celebrada
a finales de 1994 en la ciudad norteamericana de Miami, el tema
central fue el proyecto de creaci&oacute;n de una zona continental
de libre comercio a partir del TLC. El Gobierno de EEUU aprovech&oacute;
la ocasi&oacute;n para anunciar el prop&oacute;sito de de ampliar
el TLC, comenzando las negociones con Chile para despu&eacute;s
iniciar negociaciones sucesivas con el resto de pa&iacute;ses
latinoamericanos hasta conformar una zona de libre comercio hemisf&eacute;rica.
</P>
<P>
La r&aacute;pida evoluci&oacute;n del MERCOSUR desde la firma
del Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n hasta nuestros d&iacute;as fue
precedida por una estrecha cooperaci&oacute;n. En efecto, los
ante-cedentes inmediatos del MERCOSUR hay que buscarlos en el
lanzamiento, por parte de Argentina y Brasil, del Programa de
Integraci&oacute;n y Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica (PICE),
en 1986, con el prop&oacute;sito de lograr el aumento y el cambio
en la composici&oacute;n de las transacciones comerciales bilaterales.
Esta etapa inicial del proceso integrador fue complementada por
la firma, el 29 de noviembre de 1988, del Tratado de Integraci&oacute;n,
Cooperaci&oacute;n y Desarrollo, cuyo cometido era continuar con
la profundizaci&oacute;n de los protocolos sectoriales y establecer
un calendario de diez a&ntilde;os para la formaci&oacute;n de
un espacio com&uacute;n entre los dos pa&iacute;ses. </P>
<P>
La firma, el seis de julio de 1990, del Acta de Buenos Aires dio
un nuevo impulso al proceso de integraci&oacute;n bilateral al
decidirse la creaci&oacute;n de un mercado com&uacute;n para el
uno de enero de 1995. Para llegar con aranceles nulos a dicha
fecha, en el &aacute;cta se establecieron rebajas lineales y autom&aacute;ticas,
en per&iacute;odos semestrales, aplicables a todo el comercio
bilateral (se prioriz&oacute; as&iacute; la expansi&oacute;n del
comercio en general sobre las complementariedades sectoriales
que hab&iacute;a caracterizado al PICE). </P>
<P>
Cronol&oacute;gicamente, la etapa siguiente fue coronada con la
firma del Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n, en marzo de 1991, momento
en el cual Paraguay y Uruguay se sumaron al proceso de integraci&oacute;n
iniciado por Argentina y Brasil en 1986. El Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n
establece la formaci&oacute;n de un mercado com&uacute;n mediante
la eliminaci&oacute;n de todas las restricciones arancelarias
y no arancelarias a la libre circulaci&oacute;n de bienes, servicios
y factores productivos; la adopci&oacute;n de una tarifa externa
com&uacute;n, en el marco de una pol&iacute;tica comercial &uacute;nica;
y la coordinaci&oacute;n y armonizaci&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas
econ&oacute;micas y sectoriales en las &aacute;reas agr&iacute;cola,
industrial, fiscal, monetaria, cambiaria y de capitales, de servicios,
aduanera, y de transporte y comunicaciones. Asimismo, el Tratado
concede a Paraguay y Uruguay la posibilidad de que adopten ritmos
diferentes en la implementaci&oacute;n del Programa de Liberalizaci&oacute;n
Comercial. </P>
<P>
El Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n contempla la adhesi&oacute;n al
MERCOSUR de nuevos socios (Estados miembros de la ALADI) siempre
que no formen parte de otros esquemas de integraci&oacute;n y
despu&eacute;s que hayan pasado cinco a&ntilde;os desde la entrada
en vigor del mismo. Bolivia ha sido el primer pa&iacute;s en intentar
un acercamiento al MERCOSUR, aun cuando su pertenencia al GRAN
impide por el momento su adhesion. El inter&eacute;s de Bolivia
por fomentar lazos con el MERCOSUR se tradujo en la firma de un
Acuerdo de Complementaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica, el siete de
diciembre de 1995, en el marco de la Cumbre de presidentes del
MERCOSUR que se llev&oacute; a cabo en Punta del Este (Uruguay).
El acercamiento de Bolivia se fundamenta en las fluidas relaciones
econ&oacute;micas (ese pa&iacute;s realiza el 60% de sus intercambios
comerciales con el Cono Sur) y de cooperaci&oacute;n que mantiene
con los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR. La pertenencia al Tratado
de la Cuenca del Plata y la participaci&oacute;n conjunta de Bolivia
y los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR en grandes proyectos de cooperaci&oacute;n
internacional, como la hidrov&iacute;a Paran&aacute;-Paraguay,
constituyen ejemplos contundentes de la pertenencia de Bolivia
al &aacute;mbito de cooperaci&oacute;n del Cono Sur. </P>
<P>
La situaci&oacute;n es complicada en relaci&oacute;n a Chile,
ya que este pa&iacute;s negocia desde una posici&oacute;n privilegiada
en materia de comercio exterior que se sustenta en la aplicaci&oacute;n
de un arancel exterior mucho m&aacute;s competitivo que el del
MERCOSUR. Sin embargo, en la Cumbre celebrada en Buenos Aires,
en agosto de 1994, las autoridades chilenas manifestaron su intenci&oacute;n
de fomentar sus v&iacute;nculos con el MERCOSUR y sentaron las
bases para la negociaci&oacute;n de acuerdos de complementariedad
econ&oacute;mica con vistas a crear una zona de libre comercio
(se prev&eacute; la conclusi&oacute;n del acuerdo para mediados
de 1996). Pero Chile tambi&eacute;n apunta a ingresar como miembro
del ALCAN y pretende, adem&aacute;s, firmar una acuerdo de libre
comercio con la UE. En efecto, la diversificaci&oacute;n de los
mercados chilenos favorece su inserci&oacute;n en varios esquemas,
sin que ello signifique un compromiso excluyente<a href="#13">(13)</a>. </P>
<P>
Pese a la negativa de Chile para ingresar en el MERCOSUR, ese
pa&iacute;s reconoce la importancia de los intercambios comerciales
con Brasil y Argentina. Si bien Chile tiene d&eacute;ficit comercial
con el MERCOSUR, igualmente la subregi&oacute;n le resulta muy
atractiva para la adquisici&oacute;n de insumos y la colocaci&oacute;n
de exportaciones de manufacturas en minerales, pesca, forestales
y fruta. Por otro lado, los puertos del Pac&iacute;fico chileno
son atractivos como salida de las exportaciones del MERCOSUR a
los mercados asi&aacute;ticos (Chile se ha mostrado muy interesado
en esta posibilidad, ya que supone una reactivaci&oacute;n de
los puertos del norte de ese pa&iacute;s ); no obstante, las aspiraciones
bioce&aacute;nicas del Cono Sur se ven contrarrestadas por deficiencias
en la integraci&oacute;n f&iacute;sica de la subregi&oacute;n
que por ahora buscan superarse con corredores viales que van desde
los puertos de Brasil a los de Chile atravesando Argentina, Bolivia
y Paraguay. </P>
<P>
La estrategia del MERCOSUR no se agota en la posible incorporaci&oacute;n
de Bolivia y Chile, sino que ambiciona extenderse a todo el continente
sudamericano mediante la constituci&oacute;n de una &ccedil;rea
de Libre Comercio Sudamericana (ALCSA). La propuesta fue presentada
por Brasil en octubre de 1992, en Santiago (Chile) durante la
reuni&oacute;n del Grupo de R&iacute;o y se llevar&iacute;a a
cabo mediante una red de acuerdos bilaterales o plurilaterales
en el &aacute;mbito de la ALADI. En la pr&aacute;ctica, el ALCSA
englobar&iacute;a al MERCOSUR y el GRAN, ya que en esos dos espacios
integrados se encuentran la totalidad de los pa&iacute;ses sudamericanos,
con excepci&oacute;n de Chile. </P>
<P>
<B>Aspectos salientes de la evoluci&oacute;n actual del MERCOSUR</B>
</P>
<P>
1994 hab&iacute;a comenzado con resultados poco alentadores para
la evoluci&oacute;n de la integraci&oacute;n: en el V Consejo
del MERCOSUR (Punta del Este, enero de 1994) no se logr&oacute;
avanzar en el establecimiento de un arancel externo com&uacute;n
(AEC ), que era la principal cuesti&oacute;n pendiente del MERCOSUR;
esta situaci&oacute;n, a su vez, sembr&oacute; dudas sobre el
cumplimiento de lo acordado en Las Le&ntilde;as para el establecimiento
de un mercado com&uacute;n<a href="#14">(14)</a>. Las sospechas se disiparon en
el VI Consejo del MERCOSUR (Buenos Aires, agosto de 1994 ), donde
se acord&oacute; constituir una uni&oacute;n aduanera a partir
del uno de enero de 1995 para comercializar los productos de los
cuatro pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR, aunque con algunas excepciones<a href="#15">(15)</a>. </P>
<P>
En cuanto a la evoluci&oacute;n de las corrientes comerciales
entre los cuatro pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR, la aplicaci&oacute;n
del Programa de Liberalizaci&oacute;n Comercial acordado en el
Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n ha arrojado resultados extraordinarios.
Las cifras al respecto son elocuentes. En 1995, el volumen del
comercio entre los socios super&oacute; los 15.000 millones de
d&oacute;lares frente a los 10.000 millones de d&oacute;lares
alcanzados en 1994. En 1993, a su vez, los socios del MERCOSUR
totalizaron intercambios por 8.000 millones de d&oacute;lares
cuando en 1990 las cifras del comercio intrarregional s&oacute;lo
alcanzaron 3.600 millones de d&oacute;lares. Por otro lado, actualmente
se registran 258 iniciativas privadas argentino-brasile&ntilde;as,
y Brasil ha anunciado su decisi&oacute;n de destrabar la radicaci&oacute;n
de empresarios argentinos en territorio brasile&ntilde;o. </P>
<P>
En el aumento del comercio intrasubregional ha influido en buena
medida la complementariedad de las econom&iacute;as de los cuatro
pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR, principalmente las de Argentina y
Brasil (Brasil vende a Argentina fundamentalmente manufacturas
industriales y a su vez compra en ese pa&iacute;s productos de
or&iacute;gen agropecuario). Otro factor que incidi&oacute; en
estos resultados fue la eficaz adaptaci&oacute;n de los sectores
de la producci&oacute;n y de servicios de los cuatro pa&iacute;ses
que han orientado sus estrategias de operaci&oacute;n en sintonia
con las distintas etapas del proceso integrador. </P>
<P>
Pese a los importantes avances registrados en el marco del MERCOSUR
a&uacute;n persisten problemas, como el de la asimetr&iacute;a
entre sus Estados miembros: mientras que la econom&iacute;a brasile&ntilde;a
genera el 74,1% de la producci&oacute;n subregional y la argentina
el 22,3%, Paraguay y Uruguay s&oacute;lo concentran, respectivamente,
el 1,5% y el 2,1% de la producci&oacute;n subregional total. A
su vez, la actividad comercial que cada socio realiza en el MERCOSUR
es muy desigual: mientras que Paraguay y Uruguay realizan aproximadamente
la mitad de sus transacciones comerciales en el espacio integrado,
la participaci&oacute;n de Argentina y Brasil es de el 25% y 10%,
respectivamente. Esto es as&iacute; debido a la mayor diversificaci&oacute;n
de los mercados externos que presentan Argentina y Brasil. Este
&uacute;ltimo pa&iacute;s se destaca no s&oacute;lo como un importante
exportador de materias primas, sino tambi&eacute;n de manufacturas,
equipos, servicios y tecnolog&iacute;as. En el &aacute;mbito latinoamericano,
las ventas brasile&ntilde;as al exterior representan m&aacute;s
de la cuarta parte del total latinoamericano, y en el caso de
ciertos productos como caf&eacute;, hierro y conservas de frutas,
sus exportaciones representan aproximadamente un 25% del total
mundial. </P>
<P>
La etapa m&aacute;s importante del MERCOSUR se inici&oacute; el
uno de enero de 1995 con muy buenas perspectivas<a href="#16">(16)</a>. Prueba
de ello es que, pocos d&iacute;as antes de esa fecha, los presidentes
de los cuatro pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR se reunieron en la ciudad
brasile&ntilde;a de Ouro Preto para adoptar importantes decisiones
en torno al proceso integrador. En este encuentro se ha destacado
la voluntad pol&iacute;tica de los presidentes de avanzar hacia
la concreci&oacute;n de una verdadera zona de libre comercio y
una uni&oacute;n aduanera, la adopci&oacute;n de un Arancel Externo
Com&uacute;n en los plazos fijados<a href="#17">(17)</a>, y la vigencia de normas
de or&iacute;gen para los productos procedentes del MERCOSUR,
estipul&aacute;ndose que el contenido local de un determinado
producto debe alcanzar el 60%, y un 80% cuando se trata de bienes
de capital estrat&eacute;gicos. </P>
<P>
Tambi&eacute;n como consecuencia de la Cumbre de Ouro Preto se
ha establecido una estructura institucional definitiva para MERCOSUR
formada por los siguientes &oacute;rganos: el Consejo del Mercado
Com&uacute;n, (CMC), de car&aacute;cter intergubernamental, cuyas
decisiones se adoptan por consenso; el Grupo Mercado Com&uacute;n
(GMC), &oacute;rgano ejecutivo y de iniciativa; la Comisi&oacute;n
de Comercio de MERCOSUR; la Comisi&oacute;n Parlamentaria Conjunta;
un Foro Consultivo, Econ&oacute;mico y Social, y la Secretaria
Administrativa. Otro logro ha sido la decisi&oacute;n de dotar
de personalidad jur&iacute;dica al MERCOSUR. </P>
<P>
La cuesti&oacute;n relativa a la soluci&oacute;n de controversias
fue regulada en el Protocolo de Brasilia que entr&oacute; en vigor
el 24 de abril de 1993. El mismo establece -transitoriamente-
un Sistema de Soluci&oacute;n de Controversias de car&aacute;cter
arbitral con el prop&oacute;sito de garantizar el adecuado cumplimiento
de las disposiciones del MERCOSUR. Este mecanismo no forma parte
de la estructura institucional y adquiri&oacute; car&aacute;cter
permanente, para actuar en &uacute;ltima instancia, a partir de
la Cumbre de Ouro Preto (la nueva Comisi&oacute;n de Comercio
es la encargada de examinar en primera instancia las reclamaciones
presentadas por los Estados Partes o los particulares en el &aacute;mbito
del comercio). </P>
<P>
En la &uacute;ltima reuni&oacute;n que mantuvieron los presidentes
del MERCOSUR (diciembre de 1995, Punta del Este, Uruguay) qued&oacute;
demostrado que el proceso integrador goza de buena salud. Las
dudas sobre la viabilidad del proceso se hab&iacute;an puesto
de manifiesto en el mes de junio de 1995 cuando se desat&oacute;
una disputa entre Argentina y Brasil a ra&iacute;z de una decisi&oacute;n
unilateral de Brasil para limitar la importaci&oacute;n de autom&oacute;viles
argentinos. En este &uacute;ltimo encuentro, los presidentes de
Argentina y Brasil se encargaron de disipar dudas al anunciar
que se hab&iacute;a llegado a un importante acuerdo en el sector
automotriz, con lo cual se superaron las fricciones<a href="#18">(18)</a>. La oportunidad
fue propicia para que los presidentes expresaran su benepl&aacute;cito
por la pr&oacute;xima entrada en vigencia del Protocolo de Ouro
Preto que, entre otros aspectos, otorga entidad jur&iacute;dica
al MERCOSUR. Por &uacute;ltimo, los presidentes tambi&eacute;n
se refirieron con benepl&aacute;cito por la pr&oacute;xima constituci&oacute;n
del Foro Consultivo Econ&oacute;mico y Social, a partir del cual
se propicia una mayor implicaci&oacute;n de la sociedad en el
proceso integrador. </P>
<P>
Los retos a que debe enfrentarse el MERCOSUR para seguir avanzando
hacia un mercado &uacute;nico est&aacute;n vinculados a la estabilidad
econ&oacute;mica de Brasil y Argentina<a href="#19">(19)</a>, el perfeccionamiento
de la uni&oacute;n aduanera y una mayor integraci&oacute;n f&iacute;sica
entre los cuatro pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR. Una vez alcanzados
estos objetivos, se podr&aacute; profundizar el proceso hasta
alcanzar el mercado &uacute;nico que conlleve a la libre circulaci&oacute;n
de bienes, servicios, capitales, y personas. En esta etapa se
requerir&aacute; una verdadera coordinaci&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas
macroecon&oacute;micas y una armonizaci&oacute;n de legislaciones
nacionales. </P>
<P>
<B>La cooperaci&oacute;n UE-MERCOSUR</B> </P>
<P>
La consolidaci&oacute;n del MERCOSUR ha supuesto un salto cualitativo
muy trascendente y ha abierto una nueva etapa en la proyecci&oacute;n
internacional de este grupo de pa&iacute;ses. Ello ha propiciado
el estrechamiento de v&iacute;nculos con otros pa&iacute;ses y
regiones del mundo. Este nuevo contexto ha posibilitado la firma
de un Acuerdo Marco sobre Comercio e Inversiones entre el MERCOSUR
y EEUU (Acuerdo 4 + 1) con el fin de fortalecer el di&aacute;logo
entre ambas partes y negociar las modalidades de una futura cooperaci&oacute;n.
</P>
<P>
Pero la mayor interrelaci&oacute;n del MERCOSUR con otras regiones
se ha efectuado con la UE. Los progresos alcanzados por el MERCOSUR
han constituido la mejor baza para avanzar en una cooperaci&oacute;n
UE-MERCOSUR. Desde un primer momento, los Estados miembros del
Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n buscaron en la experiencia de la UE
en materia de integraci&oacute;n un patr&oacute;n que les sirviera
de referencia para afianzar el MERCOSUR. El acercamiento se reforz&oacute;
con la celebraci&oacute;n de un primer encuentro de ministros
de Asuntos Exteriores de la UE y el MERCOSUR en Guimaraes (Portugal)
en 1992, oportunidad que sirvi&oacute; para promover una comunicaci&oacute;n
fluida e identificar las &aacute;reas de una futura cooperaci&oacute;n.
A este primer encuentro sucedieron otros dos en Copenhague y Sao
Paulo, en 1993 y 1994, respectivamente, cre&aacute;ndose una forma
de di&aacute;logo politico UE-MERCOSUR con el fin de promover
la cooperaci&oacute;n y la asistencia europea al nuevo espacio
integrado del Cono Sur. El resultado m&aacute;s promisorio de
este corto pero fecundo per&iacute;odo de comunicaci&oacute;n
interregional se tradujo en la firma de un Acuerdo de Cooperaci&oacute;n
Interinstitucional, firmado en Santiago de Chile, en mayo de 1992
en presencia de los ministros de Asuntos Exteriores de la UE y
el MERCOSUR. Este acuerdo busca promover la capacidad y eficacia
de las instituciones del MERCOSUR, definiendo cuatro modos de
cooperaci&oacute;n: asistencia t&eacute;cnica, intercambio de
informaci&oacute;n, formaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos y apoyo
institucional. Con base a este acuerdo, que tiene una duraci&oacute;n
de tres a&ntilde;os prorrogables, se ha instituido el Comit&eacute;
Consultivo Conjunto, que a su vez est&aacute; compuesto por representantes
del GMC y la Comisi&oacute;n Europea y se re&uacute;ne dos veces
al a&ntilde;o con el objeto de impulsar, definir e implementar
las acciones de cooperaci&oacute;n y de asistencia t&eacute;cnica.
</P>
<P>
La prioridad que la UE otorga a la cooperaci&oacute;n en materia
de integraci&oacute;n se ha visto reflejada en la financiaci&oacute;n
de importantes proyectos de cooperaci&oacute;n en favor de todos
los procesos de integraci&oacute;n. El 7% de las acciones de cooperaci&oacute;n
que la UE realiza en Am&eacute;rica Latina tienen car&aacute;cter
regional. Para la cooperaci&oacute;n con el MERCOSUR la UE ha
destinado 17 millones de ECU distribuidos en tres programas y
otras &aacute;reas. </P>
<P>
En primer lugar, se ha destacado el El Programa de Cooperaci&oacute;n
en Materia de Normas t&eacute;cnicas cuyo objetivo es apoyar -en
base a la experiencia europea- los esfuerzos de los pa&iacute;ses
del MERCOSUR en la puesta en funcionamiento del mercado interior
de acuerdo con los criterios internacionales de calidad y normas
t&eacute;cnicas. El programa se ejecuta a trav&eacute;s de misiones
de asistencia t&eacute;cnica directa, acciones de formaci&oacute;n
generales en temas de calidad y acciones especificas en cada una
de las &aacute;reas contempladas y suministro de equipos de oficina
(Merco-InfoCenters ). La financiaci&oacute;n de la UE en este
programa se eleva a casi 4 millones de ECU, correspondiendo a
los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR los gastos relativos a la participaci&oacute;n
de sus nacionales en las diferentes acciones de formaci&oacute;n
y asistencia t&eacute;cnica. </P>
<P>
En segundo lugar, el Programa de Cooperaci&oacute;n en Materia
Agr&iacute;cola consiste en el apoyo comunitario al proceso de
integraci&oacute;n del MERCOSUR en lo referente a la creaci&oacute;n
de un mercado interno agr&iacute;cola libre de barreras sanitarias,
promoviendo a su vez la apertura del MERCOSUR hacia nuevos mercados
internacionales. Para el cumplimiento de tales objetivos, la UE
ha propuesto un campo de actuaci&oacute;n de apoyo general institucional
(aspectos t&eacute;cnicos, legales e institucionales de la integraci&oacute;n
agr&iacute;cola) que comprender&aacute; acciones de stage de larga
duraci&oacute;n (cinco meses) en los servicios de la Comisi&oacute;n.
Por otro lado, se constituyeron dos Subprogramas t&eacute;cnicos
de sanidad Animal y sanidad Vegetal<a href="#20">(20)</a>. La financiaci&oacute;n
de la UE a este programa asciende a 11,2 millones de ECU y abarca
la celebraci&oacute;n de una conferencia/seminario anual sobre
los temas relacionados con el programa y la pol&iacute;tica comunitaria
aplicada en estos aspectos (difusi&oacute;n y marketing del programa).
</P>
<P>
Por &uacute;ltimo, el Programa de Apoyo a la Armonizaci&oacute;n
Aduanera tiene por objetivo facilitar la coordinaci&oacute;n de
las pol&iacute;ticas aduaneras de los Estados del MERCOSUR y la
armonizaci&oacute;n de sus legislaciones para reforzar el proceso
de integraci&oacute;n. Tambi&eacute;n se prev&eacute;n estancias
de expertos del MERCOSUR en la UE para obtener conocimiento directo
sobre el funcionamiento y la realidad europea en esta materia
(las estancias abarcan visitas a instituciones comunitarias, puestos
fronterizos y organismos aduaneros de los Estados de la UE). </P>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n de la UE con el MERCOSUR tambi&eacute;n
se canaliza a trav&eacute;s de un Fondo de Apoyo a la Presidencia
para la realizaci&oacute;n de peque&ntilde;as acciones en &aacute;reas
no prioritarias de la cooperaci&oacute;n de la UE, es decir, aquellas
no incluidas &eacute;n programas de cooperaci&oacute;n UE-MERCOSUR.
El Fondo de Apoyo a la Presidencia est&aacute; dotado de una financiaci&oacute;n
comunitaria de 250.000 ECU, y persigue apoyar el proceso de integraci&oacute;n,
apoyar el ejercicio de la Presidencia pro-tempore, promover contactos
entre expertos en integraci&oacute;n de la construcci&oacute;n
europea y del MERCOSUR, y promover la realizaci&oacute;n de acciones
coordinadas entre los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR en &aacute;reas
de menor prioridad. Pese a que, en un primer momento, el funcionamiento
del Fondo se ha visto obstaculizado por inconvenientes derivados
de la falta de coordinaci&oacute;n entre ambos lados y la desinformaci&oacute;n
de los funcionarios del MERCOSUR sobre el destino que la UE ha
querido dar a estos recursos, actualmente la Comisi&oacute;n Europea
y el MERCO-SUR han acordado mecanismos m&aacute;s claros y especificos
para la atribuci&oacute;n de los recursos previstos en el Fondo.
</P>
<P>
La preocupaci&oacute;n de la UE por las asimetr&iacute;as que
caracterizan a las econom&iacute;as de los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR
decidi&oacute; a la Comisi&oacute;n a estudiar un nuevo programa
de cooperaci&oacute;n, dirigido a poner a disposici&oacute;n del
MERCOSUR sus experiencias relativas a las pol&iacute;ticas comunitarias
de apoyo regional. Esta nueva &aacute;rea de cooperaci&oacute;n
-la cuarta en el contexto de las relaciones UE-MERCOSUR- ha sido
denominada Promoci&oacute;n de la Cohesi&oacute;n; Fortalecimiento
de la Integraci&oacute;n en el MERCOSUR y cubre las siguientes
&aacute;reas: reconversi&oacute;n industrial (industria y adaptaci&oacute;n
de las regiones ), zonas fronterizas, infraestructuras de transporte
y cohesi&oacute;n social. Cabe destacar, asimismo, que en base
a la experiencia europea relativa a la administraci&oacute;n de
los r&iacute;os Rhin y Danubio, la UE est&aacute; contribuyendo
financieramente al proyecto del canal Paran&aacute;-Paraguay,
tanto para la realizaci&oacute;n de los estudios t&eacute;cnicos
de los puertos fluviales, como para el dise&ntilde;o institucional
de gesti&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
<B>El MERCOSUR: nueva prioridad de la pol&iacute;tica exterior
europea</B> </P>
<P>
Sin lugar a dudas, la fusi&oacute;n de intereses particulares
en una agenda com&uacute;n de negociaciones externas, entre los
cuatro pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR ha redimensionado la actuaci&oacute;n
internacional de los mismos y ha asegurado mejores condiciones
de negociaci&oacute;n frente a otros bloques econ&oacute;micos.
</P>
<P>
La pol&iacute;tica de acercamiento se inici&oacute; dias antes
de la firma del Tratado de Asunci&oacute;n, cuando los ministros
de Asuntos Exteriores de Argentina, Brasil, Paraguay y Uruguay
viajaron a Bruselas para presentar al MERCOSUR, ante las autoridades
de la UE: se dio as&iacute; el primer paso hacia un fortalecimiento
de las relaciones interregionales. Despu&eacute;s de este acontecimiento
se intensificaron los encuentros, documentos y declaraciones de
uno y otro lado en favor del fortalecimiento de los v&iacute;nculos
UE-MERCOSUR cuya culminaci&oacute;n fue la firma del Acuerdo Marco
Interregional entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y el MERCOSUR. </P>
<P>
La idea sobre el acuerdo interregional comenz&oacute; a gestarse
en los encuentros anuales UE-MERCOSUR (ya mencionados ), en los
que se trat&oacute; concretamente esa posibilidad y se decidi&oacute;
una agenda de actividades que tendr&iacute;an por objetivo iniciar
las negociaciones respectivas. El creciente inter&eacute;s por
esta cuesti&oacute;n se evidenci&oacute; en el Consejo Europeo
de Corf&uacute;, Grecia, celebrado en junio de 1994, donde se
decidi&oacute; fortalecer las relaciones UE-MERCOSUR. En la misma
direcci&oacute;n, en el marco del VI Consejo del MERCOSUR reunido
en Buenos Aires, se emiti&oacute; el cinco de agosto de 1994 una
declaraci&oacute;n de los presidentes del MERCOSUR en Relaci&oacute;n
con la Uni&oacute;n Europea. Por su parte, El vicepresidente de
la Comisi&oacute;n Europea, Manuel Mar&iacute;n, se refiri&oacute;,
en octubre de 1994, a la posibilidad de un acuerdo de cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica y comercial entre la UE y el MERCOSUR como primer
paso hacia una zona de libre comercio que comenzar&iacute;a a
funcionar en el 2001. En noviembre de 1994, la Comisi&oacute;n
Europea lanz&oacute; una propuesta estrat&eacute;gica para la
creaci&oacute;n, a largo plazo, de una zona de libre comercio
transatl&aacute;ntica entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y el MERCOSUR
(la propuesta fue aprobada por el Consejo Europeo de Essen, Alemania,
en diciembre de 1994 ). En el mismo sentido, la Comisi&oacute;n
de Relaciones Econ&oacute;micas Exteriores del Parlamento Europeo
emite, el 12 de abril de 1995, un informe favorable sobre la comunicaci&oacute;n
de la Comisi&oacute;n. Finalmente, con la Declaraci&oacute;n Solemne
Conjunta entre el Consejo de la Uni&oacute;n Europea y la Comisi&oacute;n
Europea, por una parte, y los Estados miembros del MERCOSUR, por
otra, del 12 de diciembre de 1994 (Bruselas), se confirm&oacute;
el deseo mutuo de iniciar el camino hacia la creaci&oacute;n de
una asociaci&oacute;n interregional. Este hecho marca un hito
en las relaciones interregionales ya que, por primera vez, la
UE da prioridad a la cooperaci&oacute;n con una subregi&oacute;n
de Am&eacute;rica Latina. </P>
<P>
<B>Contenido del Acuerdo Marco Interregional</B> </P>
<P>
La firma del Acuerdo Marco Interregional de Cooperaci&oacute;n
entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y sus Estados miembros y el Mercado
Com&uacute;n del Sur y sus Estados miembros tuvo lugar en Madrid,
el 15 de diciembre de 1995, en presencia de los jefes de Estado
o de Gobierno de los quince Estados miembros de la UE y los presidentes
de Argentina, Paraguay y Uruguay (el presidente de Brasil no asisti&oacute;
por encontrarse de viaje oficial en &ccedil;sia). </P>
<P>
El acuerdo se fundamenta en el respeto de los principios democr&aacute;ticos
y de los Derechos Humanos y consagra el reforzamiento de la cooperaci&oacute;n
pol&iacute;tica a trav&eacute;s de un di&aacute;logo interregional
con car&aacute;cter regular. Esta primera etapa, cuyo objetivo
es trazar el camino hacia una zona de libre comercio, se calcula
que tardar&aacute; cinco a&ntilde;os en consolidarse, dando por
descontado que las mayores dificultades para la liberalizaci&oacute;n
comercial se van a crear en el cap&iacute;tulo agr&iacute;cola.
</P>
<P>
El acuerdo establece una cooperaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s estrecha
a trav&eacute;s de un di&aacute;logo econ&oacute;mico y comercial,
y en temas como organizaci&oacute;n aduanera, fomento de inversiones,
energ&iacute;a, propiedad intelectual, y ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a.
En el acuerdo tambi&eacute;n se enfatiza la cooperaci&oacute;n
en materia de telecomunicaciones y tecnolog&iacute;as de la informaci&oacute;n;
protecci&oacute;n del medio ambiente; fortalecimiento de la integraci&oacute;n;
cooperaci&oacute;n interinstitucional y lucha contra el narcotr&aacute;fico.
Asimismo, se establece una cl&aacute;usula evolutiva por la que
las partes podr&aacute;n ampliar los niveles de cooperaci&oacute;n
del acuerdo a nuevos sectores. </P>
<P>
A nivel institucional, el acuerdo instituye un Consejo de Cooperaci&oacute;n
que supervisar&aacute; la puesta en marcha del Acuerdo y examinar&aacute;
los problemas importantes que puedan plantearse en el marco del
acuerdo, as&iacute; como todas las dem&aacute;s cuestiones bilaterales
o internacionales de inter&eacute;s com&uacute;n con vistas a
cumplir los objetivos del Acuerdo. El Consejo de Cooperaci&oacute;n
estar&aacute; integrado, por una parte, por miembros del Consejo
de la Uni&oacute;n Europea y por miembros de la Comisi&oacute;n
Europea, y por la otra, por miembros del Consejo del Mercado Com&uacute;n.
A su vez, el Consejo de Cooperaci&oacute;n esta-r&aacute; asistido
por una comisi&oacute;n mixta de cooperaci&oacute;n compuesta
por representantes de la UE y del MERCOSUR que se reunir&aacute;
una vez al a&ntilde;o. </P>
<P>
Los m&oacute;viles que llevaron a la UE a concluir este acuerdo
son de naturaleza distinta a los motivos que fundamentan los acuerdos
de cooperaci&oacute;n preferenciales con otras regiones como Europa
del Este o Magreb. En &eacute;stos, la prioridad tiene que ver
con la geograf&iacute;a o la seguridad, mientras que en el caso
del Acuerdo Interregional UE-MERCOSUR Europa apuesta a una interrelaci&oacute;n
pol&iacute;tica y econ&oacute;mica con una mercado de 200 millones
de habitantes, en una regi&oacute;n econ&oacute;micamente emergente,
que representa casi el 50% del PIB de toda Am&eacute;rica Latina,
un tercio del comercio total regional y el 40% de las exportaciones
industriales a la regi&oacute;n. La UE ha evaluado adem&aacute;s
que las exportaciones europeas a la subregi&oacute;n han crecido
un 500% en los &uacute;ltimos diez a&ntilde;os (las del MERCOSUR
hacia la UE en ese per&iacute;odo aumentaron s&oacute;lo un 80%).
El acuerdo responde tambi&eacute;n a una estrategia de pol&iacute;tica
exterior de la UE dirigida a no perder posiciones en favor de
la hegemon&iacute;a de EEUU en una regi&oacute;n cuya importancia
a nivel internacional se hace cada vez m&aacute;s evidente y con
la que muchos Estados miembros de la UE mantienen importantes
lazos hist&oacute;ricos y culturales. </P>
<P>
Desde la perspectiva del MERCOSUR, el acuerdo significa un paso
trascendental hacia la concreci&oacute;n, previas negociaciones,
de una zona de libre comercio con una regi&oacute;n como la UE
con la que existe una gran complementariedad de estructuras productivas.
En la actualidad, el comercio interregional alcanza los 32.000
millones de d&oacute;lares. En cuanto a los beneficios inmediatos,
el acuerdo garantiza un voto de confianza para atraer inversiones
extranjeras y un posible incremento de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica.
</P>
<P>
<a name=con></a><h3>Consideraciones finales</h3> </P>
<P>
El balance de las relaciones econ&oacute;micas entre la UE y el
Cono Sur ofrece un panorama mucho menos alentador que el que aportan
los v&iacute;nculos pol&iacute;ticos y de cooperaci&oacute;n.
M&aacute;s all&aacute; de que la UE sea el primer socio comercial
y el primer inversor de los paises del Cono Sur, las relaciones
comerciales entre ambas regiones han sido particularmente conflictivas,
debido al uso de pol&iacute;ticas proteccionistas por parte de
la UE, que no han hecho m&aacute;s que entorpecer el ingreso de
productos procedentes del Cono Sur al mercado europeo y, lo que
es m&aacute;s grave a&uacute;n, se ha traducido en una competencia
desleal frente a terceros mercados. Afortunadamente, para los
pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur, el triunfo de la tesis liberalizadora
en el marco de la Ronda Uruguay del GATT significa un fortalecimiento
de sus posturas en el comercio mundial y un debilitamiento de
la posici&oacute;n proteccionista de la UE. En tal sentido, los
acuerdos alcanzados recientemente en el cap&iacute;tulo agr&iacute;cola
en el marco de la Ronda Uruguay abren al menos un m&aacute;rgen
de esperanza sobre la factibilidad de una reforma profunda de
la Pol&iacute;tica Agr&iacute;cola Com&uacute;n (PAC). </P>
<P>
Los progresos pol&iacute;ticos y econ&oacute;micos alcanzados
en el Cono Sur han sido evaluados como un factor clave para avanzar
hacia niveles superiores de cooperaci&oacute;n con la UE. No obstante,
la escasa asignaci&oacute;n de recursos otorgados en el marco
de la avanzada Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica contrasta con
el espectacular salto cualitativo que la cooperaci&oacute;n de
la UE pretende adoptar en sus relaciones con las emergentes econom&iacute;as
del Cono Sur. En este sentido, el alcance limitado de los ATG
firmados entre la UE y el Cono Sur emana de su tipificaci&oacute;n
como acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica y comercial
no preferencial, sin que en ning&uacute;n caso la UE se haya mostrado
dispuesta a incluir facilidades en condiciones similares a los
acuerdos celebrados por la UE con otros pa&iacute;ses y regiones
en v&iacute;as de desarrollo. De ello se deduce que los ATG responden
parcialmente a las expectativas que las democracias latinoamericanas
hab&iacute;an alentado en relaci&oacute;n a una cooperaci&oacute;n
europea preferencial. </P>
<P>
En cuanto a las iniciativas de di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico
interregional, las que surgieron &uacute;ltimamente presentan
mejores perspectivas que otros intentos encarados en el pasado,
entre otras razones porque, Am&eacute;rica Latina en general y
el Cono Sur en particular, han entrado en una etapa de estabilidad
institucional y econ&oacute;mica. En este sentido, los resultados
alcanzados en el marco de los di&aacute;logos UE-Grupo de R&iacute;o,
aunque discretos, permiten vislumbrar el comienzo de una nueva
etapa, caracterizada por una mayor atenci&oacute;n de ambas regiones
hacia los asuntos de inter&eacute;s com&uacute;n y una vocaci&oacute;n
de di&aacute;logo constructivo nunca observada antes. La v&iacute;a
pol&iacute;tica se perfila, a su vez, como un mecanismo id&oacute;neo
para dirimir los conflictos comerciales entre ambas regiones y
ampliar la agenda a nuevas &aacute;reas de inter&eacute;s mutuo.
</P>
<P>
Pero si las expectativas en torno al di&aacute;logo UE-Grupo de
R&iacute;o son alentadoras, el panorama que se abri&oacute; para
las relaciones UE-Cono Sur a partir de la constituci&oacute;n
del Mercado Com&uacute;n del Sur (MERCOSUR) es a&uacute;n mucho
m&aacute;s promisorio. La f&oacute;rmula de entendimiento es muy
simple: el MERCOSUR crece a pasos agigantados y la UE quiere participar
de ese crecimiento. De ah&iacute; que la UE haya dado prioridad
a una subregi&oacute;n con la que cuarenta a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s
manten&iacute;a excelentes v&iacute;nculos econ&oacute;micos en
armon&iacute;a con sus estructuras productivas. No es el momento
de juzgar aqu&iacute; y ahora las causas del alejamiento mutuo,
pero s&iacute; es oportuno exaltar el nuevo enfoque con que, tanto
a uno y otro lado del Atl&aacute;ntico, se est&aacute;n redescubriendo
dos regiones que nunca tendr&iacute;an que haberse alejado la
una de la otra. Lo interesante de esta nueva etapa es la seriedad
y el respeto con que se enfocan las pol&iacute;ticas exteriores
de cada lado. El camino va a ser largo y las negociaciones se
entorpecer&aacute;n una y otra vez, pero a medio y largo plazo
la mejor alternativa para la UE y el MERCOSUR es unirse y fomentar
una integraci&oacute;n que no margine a ning&uacute;n sector.
</P>
<P>
Para finalizar, es preciso dejar bien sentado que el optimismo
que envuelve a las relaciones UE-Cono Sur no debe distraer la
atenci&oacute;n sobre los retos a los que las dos uniones aduaneras
deben enfrentarse para hacer posible una asociaci&oacute;n interregional.
Los europeos, por su parte, tienen ante s&iacute; un desaf&iacute;o
nada f&aacute;cil de sortear: la resistencia del temperamental
sector agropecuario europeo, que en todo momento va a constituir
un factor de presi&oacute;n en todo lo relativo al desmantelamiento
del proteccionismo agropecuario. Asimismo, deber&aacute;n prepararse
para competir en igualdad de condiciones con los mercados emergentes,
como el brasile&ntilde;o y, en menor escala, el argentino. </P>
<P>
Los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR deber&aacute;n limar asperezas
e intereses mezquinos para dar el paso m&aacute;s importante del
proceso integrador: la constituci&oacute;n del mercado com&uacute;n.
Para ello deber&aacute;n apelar a la negociaci&oacute;n constructiva
y buscar una coordinaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s efectiva en materia
de conducci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica, que evite disparidades
y medidas unilaterales que pueden entorpecer la integraci&oacute;n.
En la perspectiva de una asociaci&oacute;n con la UE, los beneficios
m&aacute;s significativos para el MERCOSUR son los derivados de
una verdadera liberalizaci&oacute;n comercial de los productos
agr&iacute;colas de la UE. No obstante, para el mejor aprovechamiento
de esas facilidades, los productores agropecuarios del MERCOSUR
deber&aacute;n adaptar las estructuras productivas y comerciales
con capacidad de generar una oferta exportadora de &oacute;ptima
calidad y diversificada en funci&oacute;n de las exigencias de
un mercado como el europeo. </P>
<P>
<a name=not></a><h3>Notas</h3> </P>
<P>
<a name =1></a>1. Se trata de un programa de desregulaci&oacute;n y liberalizaci&oacute;n
que se configura a partir del programa del Libro Blanco, de junio
de 1985, sobre la obtenci&oacute;n del un mercado interior previsto
para finales de 1992. El Libro Blanco adquiri&oacute; car&aacute;cter
jur&iacute;dico vinculante con su adopci&oacute;n en el marco
del Acta &ograve;nica Europea (AUE) de julio de 1987, que supuso
la primera revisi&oacute;n del Tratado de Roma de 1957 e introdujo
una serie de reformas institucionales, y estableci&oacute; las
bases jur&iacute;dicas para el programa del NUE. </P>
<P>
<a name=2></a>2. El crecimiento y diversificaci&oacute;n de las exportaciones
del Cono Sur hacia el mercado comunitario se ha visto seriamente
afectado por la proliferaci&oacute;n de medidas arancelarias y
para-arancelarias, instituidas en el marco de la pol&iacute;tica
comercial de la UE con el prop&oacute;sito de resguardar a los
productos de los Estados miembros de la UE de la competencia exterior
y favorecer el ingreso de productos provenientes de determinados
pa&iacute;ses extracomunitarios. El establecimiento de cuotas,
contingentes, precios de referencia y aranceles escalonados no
ha hecho m&aacute;s que obstaculizar el intercambio comercial
entre la UE y los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur. </P>
<P>
<a name=3></a>3. El comercio UE-Brasil se ha resentido por las fluctuaciones
de los precios internacionales y por la instrumentaci&oacute;n
de pol&iacute;ticas intervencionistas y proteccionistas que, tanto
de uno como de otro lado, se han adoptado en favor de sus respectivos
mercados. Brasil ha sido uno de los pa&iacute;ses que con mayor
empe&ntilde;o ha defendido este tipo de pol&iacute;ticas, destac&aacute;ndose
entre otras la legislaci&oacute;n sobre similar nacional, que
establec&iacute;a el derecho de las autoridades brasile&ntilde;as
a frenar las importaciones que pudieran afectar alguna industria
nacional, y reserva de mercado, por la que se prohib&iacute;a
la compra en el exterior de productos que tuvieran un equivalente
brasile&ntilde;o (uno de los sectores al que mayor grado de protecci&oacute;n
se ha concedido en Brasil es el de la inform&aacute;tica). No
obstante, por primera vez en la d&eacute;cada actual se ha observado
una tendencia a reducir el proteccionismo, que es a su vez incomparablemente
menos pernicioso que el practicado por la UE. </P>
<P>
<a name=4></a>4. Chile ha logrado un &eacute;xito importante en lo econ&oacute;mico,
que se ha traducido en un incremento sostenido de las exportacionas
a partir de 1985 y en una diversificaci&oacute;n de productos
y mercados. Estos avances se enmarcan en una pol&iacute;tica comercial
exterior neutral, caracterizada por la ausencia de barreras comerciales,
aranceles bajos y parejos, y pol&iacute;ticas cambiarias estables.
El comportamiento favorable de los flujos de exportaciones ha
sido un factor determinante del continuo super&aacute;vit en la
balanza comercial. Los principales destinos de las exportaciones
chilenas son la UE, &ccedil;sia-Pac&iacute;fico, Am&eacute;rica
Latina, EEUU y Jap&oacute;n. Los altos niveles t&eacute;cnicos
alcanzados en la producci&oacute;n y el competitivo sector empresarial
chileno han sido decisivos para asegurar el acceso de los productos
chilenos en mercados fuertemente protegidos. La oferta exportadora
chilena se diversifica cada vez m&aacute;s y aumenta en calidad
y cantidad. En la actualidad, este pa&iacute;s exporta m&aacute;s
de 2.300 productos que en su mayor&iacute;a corresponden a cuatro
grandes sectores: qu&iacute;micominero, agr&iacute;cola, forestal
y pesquero. </P>
<P>
<a name=5></a>5. Desde que la UE inici&oacute; su cooperaci&oacute;n con los
pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina se han concluido tres generaciones
de acuerdos no preferenciales cuyos contenidos no han ido evolucionando
con el transcurso del tiempo: los de primera generaci&oacute;n
o puramente comerciales nacidos en Argentina en 1971; los de segunda
generaci&oacute;n inaugurados con M&eacute;xico en 1975 con el
fin de concretar proyectos de cooperaci&oacute;n suceptibles de
aumentar los intercambios comerciales entre las partes, y los
de tercera generaci&oacute;n o cooperaci&oacute;n avanzada, inaugurados
con Argentina en abril de 1990. </P>
<P>
<a name=6></a>6. La cooperaci&oacute;n industrial de la UE con los pa&iacute;ses
del cono Sur ha sido reformulada recientemente con la implementaci&oacute;n
de tres instrumentos avanzados: European Community Investment
Partners (ECIP), que se establec&iacute;a en 1989 con el prop&oacute;sito
de promover las inversiones mediante la creaci&oacute;n de empresas
conjuntas, y con la participaci&oacute;n de capital europeo y
de los PVD; Business cooperation Network (BC-Net), que es un banco
de datos on-line que funciona desde 1989 con el fin de proporcionar
informaci&oacute;n relativa a oportunidades para la creaci&oacute;n
de empresas mixtas y sobre programas que incluyen la colaboraci&oacute;n
tecnol&oacute;gica de empresas europeas, y AL-INVEST (Programa
Marco de Cooperaci&oacute;n Industrial y Promoci&oacute;n de Inversiones)
que permite establecer comunicaciones entre las redes de comunicadores
econ&oacute;micos de ambas regiones (c&aacute;maras de comercio,
federaciones industriales y organismos de promoci&oacute;n). </P>
<P>
<a name=7></a>7. Dos son los programas instrumentados por la UE para el conjunto
de los PVD en los que participan los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur:
1) el Programa de Ciencia y Tecnolog&iacute;a al Servicio del
Desarrollo (CTD 3) cuyo objetivo es contribuir a mejorar la capacidad
de investigaci&oacute;n de los PVD, reducir las disparidades Norte-Sur,
en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, impulsar el intercambio
de cient&iacute;ficos y facilitar la incorporaci&oacute;n de este
componente en las ciencias de Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo.
Las prioridades de este programa se vinc&uacute;lan al problema
nutricional y de salud, la degradaci&oacute;n medioambiental y
la p&eacute;rdida de biodiversidad en pa&iacute;ses tropicales
y subtropicales. en el per&iacute;odo 1990-1994 la UE asign&oacute;
110 millones ECU para la ejecuci&oacute;n del CDT3 en los PVD,
destin&aacute;ndose a Am&eacute;rica Latina el 40% de estos recursos.
Brasil es el pa&iacute;s latinoamericano m&aacute;s beneficiado
con este programa con asuntos referidos a la salud, agricultura
tropical y medio ambiente; y el segundo en importancia entre los
PVD (despu&eacute;s de China) con el que la UE tiene relaciones
cient&iacute;fico tecnol&oacute;gicas. 2) El Programa de Cooperaci&oacute;n
Cient&iacute;fico Internacional (CCI) iniciado en 1984 con el
prop&oacute;sito de incentivar los v&iacute;nculos entre los cient&iacute;ficos
de Am&eacute;rica Latina, el Mediterr&aacute;neo y Europa mediante
el est&iacute;mulo de acciones conjuntas entre los centros de
investigaci&oacute;n de las regiones implicadas sobre temas concretos
(en 1993, la UE destin&oacute; 16,6 millones ECU a este programa).
sobre la base de que este programa est&aacute; dirigido fundamentalmente
a los pa&iacute;ses con mayor capacidad cient&iacute;fica y mayor
potencial en infraestructura y recursos humanos, los pa&iacute;ses
del Cono Sur se encuentran entre los principales beneficiarios
del programa dado su elevado desarrollo tecnol&oacute;gico en
comparaci&oacute;n con otros PVD de Am&eacute;rica Latina. </P>
<P>
<a name=8></a>8. La cooperaci&oacute;n en materia de lucha contra la droga entre
la UE y los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur forma parte de la cooperaci&oacute;n
bilateral dentro de los ATG y, en los casos de Argentina y Chile,
adem&aacute;s, mediante la participaci&oacute;n en el Programa
de Acciones de Cooperaci&oacute;n Norte-Sur en el campo de la
lucha contra las drogas y los estupefacientes creado en 1987 para
financiar proyectos de desarrollo alternativo en zonas de producci&oacute;n
il&iacute;cita, as&iacute; como los campos de prevenci&oacute;n,
epidemiolog&iacute;a, tratamiento y rehabilitaci&oacute;n. La
UE ha destinado a Am&eacute;rica Latina 11,58 millones ECU dentro
del Programa Norte-Sur en el per&iacute;odo 1987-1993, de los
cuales Argentina ha recibido 830.000 ECU y Chile 1,07 millones
ECU. En 1993, la UE destin&oacute; al Programa con Am&eacute;rica
Latina casi 5 millones ECU para la financiaci&oacute;n de proyectos
en Am&eacute;rica del Sur y 2 en Am&eacute;rica Central. Si bien
los principales beneficiarios del programa son los pa&iacute;ses
andinos, en 1993 se incluy&oacute; tambi&eacute;n un proyecto
sobre formaci&oacute;n de trabajadores de la salud en el Cono
Sur. Por otro lado, el problema de la droga ha propiciado una
mayor colaboraci&oacute;n entre los Estados miembros de la UE,
las ONG que trabajan en este campo y los pa&iacute;ses del Cono
Sur. Al respecto, merece destacarse la financiaci&oacute;n por
parte de Alemania de proyectos bilaterales de lucha contra la
droga con pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos, entre ellos Brasil,
Uruguay, por u total de 10,5millones de d&oacute;lares entre 1992
y 1994; y la asignaci&oacute;n de 300.000 d&oacute;lares que Gran
Breta&ntilde;a ha destinado a la formaci&oacute;n de oficiales
aduaneros en el per&iacute;odo 1991-1993. </P>
<P>
<a name=9></a>9. Este tipo de cooperaci&oacute;n cobr&oacute; renovado impulso
con la aparici&oacute;n de las Orientaciones de 1990, que espec&iacute;ficamente
la declar&oacute; como &aacute;rea prioritaria de la cooperaci&oacute;n
biregional. Del mismo modo, la cooperaci&oacute;n medioambiental
constituye un tema prioritario de la agenda del di&aacute;logo
birregional UE-Grupo de R&iacute;o. En cuanto a la financiaci&oacute;n
de proyectos de cooperaci&oacute;n en este &aacute;rea, la UE
dispone de dos l&iacute;neas presupuestarias, de las cuales una
se destina al entrono general (aproximadamente 6 millones ECU)
y la otra a la conservaci&oacute;n de los bosques tropicales (22
millones ECU). La cooperaci&oacute;n medioambiental europea hacia
el Cono Sur se ha concentrado en un programa piloto para la conservaci&oacute;n
de las selvas tropicales de Brasil que cuenta con un 80% de financiaci&oacute;n
europea a cargo de la l&iacute;nea presupuestaria dedicada a la
conservaci&oacute;n de bosques tropicales. Este programa ha sido
complementado por una importante colaboraci&oacute;n europea en
proyectos encarados por Brasil a partir de 1989 en el marco del
Tratado de Cooperaci&oacute;n Amaz&oacute;nica. Con respecto al
resto de los pa&iacute;ses del Cono Sur, en los ATG se atribuye
especial importancia a las acciones de cooperaci&oacute;n relativas
a temas medioambientales. En el caso de Paraguay, la preocupaci&oacute;n
europea por la degradaci&oacute;n medioambiental que afecta a
importanetes regiones de este pa&iacute;s ha generado una r&aacute;pida
movilizaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos y financieros, inclusive
antes de la entrada en vigor del ATG bilateral. </P>
<P>
<a name=10></a>10. Las exportaciones de productos de pesca de los pa&iacute;ses
del Con Sur hacia la UE son los m&aacute;s importantes de Latinoam&eacute;rica,
especialmente las de Argentina y Chile. Tomando como dato el alto
consumo de estos productos en diveros pa&iacute;ses europeos,
por un lado, y el alto potencial pesquero que ofrecen los pa&iacute;ses
del Cono Sur en rubros de importante demanda de la UE como calamar,
granadero, langostino y merluza, por el otro, el sector de la
pesca puede convertirse en poco tiempo en uno de los m&aacute;s
atractivos para el fomento de las relaciones comerciales interregionales.
La UE ha manifestado tambi&eacute;n su deseo de concluir acuerdos
de pesca con Chile y Uruguay, aunque ninguno de los dos pa&iacute;ses
se ha mostrado particularmente interesado en las propuestas de
la UE. En el caso de Urugay, ello se ha debido a que este tipo
de productos ha tenido acceso a otros mercados no menos importantes
que el europeo como el estadounidense y el japon&eacute;s. Respecto
a Chile, laUE ha manifestado recientemente su intenci&oacute;n
de alcanzar con ese pa&iacute;s un acuerdo de pesca y obtener
facilidades portuarias para desembarcar, procesar y despachar
a terceros pa&iacute;ses los productos de pesca de los barcos
que operan en alta mar frente a las costas chilenas.No obstante,
la existencia de intereses contrapuestos ha impedido por el momento
la negociaci&oacute;n de un acuerdo de pesca bilateral (tanto
Chile como Uruguay son importantes exportadores de pescados, moluscos
y crust&aacute;ceos). </P>
<P>
<a name=11></a>11. Los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR protagonizaron todas las iniciativas
de di&aacute;logo entre la UE y Latinoam&eacute;rica. El precedente
m&aacute;s importante en este sentido tuvo lugar en 1971 entre
la UE y el Grupo de representantes Latinoamericantos ante la UE
(GRULA); este foro de di&aacute;logo -que hab&iacute;a sido instaurado
deliberadamente para estrechar los v&iacute;nculos birregionales-
se interrumpi&oacute;, sin embargo en 1979 por la falta de inter&eacute;s
de la UE hacia los problemas planteados por los gobiernos latinoamericanos
en relaci&oacute;n a los contenciosos comerciales. En 1981 se
institucionaliz&oacute; lo que los pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos
denominaron di&aacute;logo renovado con la UE, creado para discutir
cuestiones bilaterales, tales como la evoluci&oacute;n de los
intercambios comerciales y las incidencias exteriores de la altamente
proteccionista PAC. Este mecanismo de di&aacute;logo se interrumpi&oacute;
cuando se produjo el conflico de las Malvinas, en 1982. </P>
<P>
<a name=12></a>12. El Grupo de R&iacute;o surgi&oacute; en 1986 de la fusi&oacute;n
de los pa&iacute;ses que integraron el Grupo de Contadora (Colombia,
M&eacute;xico, Panam&aacute; y Venezuela) y el Grupo de Apoyo
(Argentina, Brasil, Per&uacute; y Uruguay). La Declaraci&oacute;n
de R&iacute;o cre&oacute; el Mecanismo Permanente de Consulta
y Concentraci&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica denominado Grupo de los
Ocho o Grupo de R&iacute;o. Los objetivos principales de esta
organizaci&oacute;n son la ampliaci&oacute;n y sistematizaci&oacute;n
de la cooperaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica entre sus miembros, la
concertaci&oacute;n de posiciones comunes en cuestiones internacionales
y promover el fortalecimiento de los organismos latinoamericanos
de cooperaci&oacute;n e integraci&oacute;n. Al incorporarse en
1990 Bol&iacute;via, Chile, Ecuador y Paraguay, el Grupo de R&iacute;o
qued&oacute; representado por todos los pa&iacute;ses de Sudam&eacute;rica
y M&eacute;xico. A su vez, el Grupo se fortaleci&oacute; a partir
de la incorporaci&oacute;n, en calidad de observadores y de forma
rotativa, de un pa&iacute;s centroamericano que representa al
Istmo y de pa&iacute;s que ejerce la presencia de la Comunidad
del Caribe (CORICOM). </P>
<P>
<a name=13></a>13. Actualmente, se est&aacute;n llevando a cabo negociaciones
para la conclusi&oacute;n de un acuerdo de libre comercio MERCOSUR-Chile,
manteniendo excepciones que rondan el 10% de los bienes, para
finalmente alcanzar una liberalizaci&oacute;n total en el 2005.
La oposici&oacute;n m&aacute;s cerrada a la firma del acuerdo
de libre comercio con el MERCOSUR es ejercida por la rama m&aacute;s
conservadora del sector agropecuario chileno. La formaci&oacute;n
de una uni&oacute;n aduanera entre el MERCOSUR y Chile, como lo
deseaban los pa&iacute;ses del MERCOSUR, ha sido descartada por
Chile ya que ese pa&iacute;s tiene un arancel &uacute;nico del
11% frente a la escala del 0% al 20% que actualmente rige en el
MERCOSUR. En cualquier caso, lo que est&aacute; claro es que Chile
no est&aacute; dispuesto a resignar la posici&oacute;n privilegiada
que goza en los mercados internacionales a partir de su bajo arancel
&uacute;nico. En consecuencia, todo indica que la pol&iacute;tica
comercial chilena no persigue la integraci&oacute;n sino la conclusi&oacute;n
de acuerdos de libre comercio en el marco del TLC, el MERCOSUR
y con la UE. </P>
<P>
<a name=14></a>14. En la reuni&oacute;n del III Consejo del MERCOSUR, que se
celebr&oacute; en Las Le&ntilde;as (Argentina) en junio de 1992,
se acord&oacute; una agenda de medidas tendente a asegurar la
gradual transici&oacute;n a un mercado &uacute;nico, estableciendo
un calendario para la coordinaci&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas
macroecon&oacute;micas, sectoriales e institucionales de los pa&iacute;ses
miembros (los plazos para la ejecuci&oacute;n de estas medidas
no podr&iacute;an exceder de tres meses y habr&iacute;an de cumplirse
antes de 1995). </P>
<P>
<a name=15></a>15. En el documento conocido como Acta de Buenos Aires se establece
un AEC de entre el 0% y el 20 % para la mayor&iacute;a de los
productos. No obstante se acord&oacute; que los bienes de capital,
el sector inform&aacute;tico y un total de 300 productos por pa&iacute;s
queden excluidos del AEC y deber&aacute;n ser gradualmente eliminados
antes del 2001. </P>
<P>
<a name=16></a>16. En efecto, el 1 de enero de 1995 entra en vigor una zona de
libre comercio para el 82 % de los productos y una uni&oacute;n
aduanera para el 85% de los productos. La liberalizaci&oacute;n,
aunque importante, no es total, habi&eacute;ndose acordado una
lista temporal de excepciones para 950 productos de Uruguay, 427
de Paraguay, 221 de Argentina y 30 de Brasil. El desmantelamiento
de estas medidas deber&aacute; realizarse linealmente en un per&iacute;odo
de cuatro a&ntilde;os en los casos de Argentina y Brasil, y un
a&ntilde;o m&aacute;s tarde en los casos de Paraguay y Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
<a name=17></a>17. En armon&iacute;a con lo establecido sobre el AEC en la cumbre
de Buenos Aires de agosto de I994, en Ouro Preto se reafirm&oacute;
la aplicaci&oacute;n de una escala del 0% al 20% que deber&aacute;
culminar con su fijaci&oacute;n en un promedio del 14% en el a&ntilde;o
2001 para los casos de Argentina y Brasil, y en el a&ntilde;o
2005 para Paraguay y Uruguay. </P>
<P>
<a name=18></a>18. La buena marcha del MERCOSUR se vio quebrantada cuando, inesperadamente,
en junio de 1995, surgi&oacute; un conflicto entre Brasil y Argentina
a ra&iacute;z de medidas anunciadas por Brasil en relaci&oacute;n
al comercio automotor fuera de lo acordado en el marco del MERCOSUR
(oportunamente se hab&iacute;a estipulado que dos productos, los
veh&iacute;culos y el azucar, ser&iacute;an objeto de negociaciones
al margen del AEC). La medida establec&iacute;a la imposici&oacute;n
de cupos a la importaci&oacute;n de autos con el objeto de poder
tomar medidas de est&iacute;mulo a su demanda interna sin que
ello implique un aumento de sus importaciones. Al mismo tiempo,
Brasil dispuso un r&eacute;gimen de promoci&oacute;n en el sector
automotor que estimula a la inversi&oacute;n extranjera, d&aacute;ndole
posiblidades de competir en el mercado local (se establecieron
adem&aacute;s reducciones arancelarias para la importaci&oacute;n
de autopartes). La en&eacute;rgica protesta del Gobierno argentino
dio lugar al inicio de negociaciones bilaterales en las que Brasil
finalmente acept&oacute; retirar el proyecto de establecer cupos,
al menos en ese a&ntilde;o. Precisamente, en estos d&iacute;as,
Argentina y Brasil est&aacute;n por firmar un acuerdo alcanzado
en diciembre &uacute;ltimo en la cumbre de Punta del Este por
el que se establece un nuevo r&eacute;gimen automotor para facilitar
el intercambio de veh&iacute;culos en la subregi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>
<a name=19></a>19. El conflicto automotriz da la pauta de que los programas econ&oacute;micos
aplicados en Argentina y Brasil atraviesan distintas etapas. En
el caso de Argentina se ha observado despu&eacute;s de varios
a&ntilde;os de crecimiento sostenido de la econom&iacute;a, el
pa&iacute;s ha entrado en un per&iacute;odo recesivo que se ha
traducido en una reducci&oacute;n del consumo, altos niveles de
desocupaci&oacute;n (18,6 %) y desmantelamiento industrial y comercial.
En cambio Brasil se encuentra, despu&eacute;s da haber logrado
reducir dr&aacute;sticamente la inflaci&oacute;n, en una etapa
de crecimiento del Producto Interior Bruto (PIB), aumento del
consumo y un espectacular incremento de las importaciones. Esto
&uacute;ltimo provoc&oacute; un d&eacute;ficit de 800 millones
de d&oacute;lares en el primer semestre de 1995. De ah&iacute;
que el gobierno brasile&ntilde;o, preocupado por equilibrar la
balanza comercial, introdujo la limitaci&oacute;n de importaci&oacute;n
de autom&oacute;viles desde Argentina como una medida para contrarrestar
el d&eacute;ficit. En cambio, la prioridad del Gobierno argentino
en este momento es promover la creaci&oacute;n de empleo y la
promoci&oacute;n de exportaciones, especialmente en el MERCOSUR.

<html><head><title>NI Letter from Lagos - Dec 94</title><!!keys: New Internationalist+Nigeria+mobile phones></head><body><h2>New Internationalist - Letter From Lagos</h2><i>The material that follows has been provided by </i><a href="NIinfo.html">New Internationalist</a><hr><p><h3>Phoning for democracy</h3><p><i>Mobile cell-phones in Nigeria are the playboy's toy. But, as<b>Elizabeth Obadina</b> found out, they have other uses as well...</i><p>The ragged youth stood centre-stage on a traffic island in themiddle of the Lagos morning 'go-slow' - elsewhere known as the'rush-hour' - and held an animated conversation on his mobiletelephone. He chuckled. He struck aggressive business poses. Hewhispered, and laughed and slapped his thighs. His left handtraced expansive projects in the sky. His whole being wasconcentrated on his never-ending telephone conversation.<p>Would you dare interrupt such intense conversation? He'd bedelighted. For with acting skills which would do a nationaldrama company credit - if Nigeria had one - this young boy,straight from the village, is avoiding destitution by sellingthe latest hot item to be sold through the Lagos traffic jams -a fake cellular phone.<p><img src="ni_pix/niphone.gif"> <p>Telephony in general is still strictly for those with money.Mobile phones are for businesses and for the super-rich, but fora fraction of the price you can now fool your friends and poseas one of the elite.<p>In many ways mobile telephone technology is the ideal means ofproviding a telephone service for Nigeria's 90 million people.They live scattered in towns and villages which spread from thevast desert expanse of the Sahara's southern fringe, southwardsthrough savannah and the virgin rainforests across the mountainsof the Cameroon borderlands. Nigeria meets the Atlantic Ocean ina morass of inaccessible mangrove swamps and deltaic lagoons.<p>Nowhere is very suitable for the laying of telephone land lines.The latest colonists of the southern swamplands; the oilcompanies, use radio communication. How wonderful cellulartelephone networks would be for reaching the villages that fewother services can reach. As it is mobile phones are merely theultimate fashion accessory in the few major Nigerian citiescovered by cellular phone networks. The phones lie concealed inthe voluminous starched gowns worn by both men and women withoutruining the fashionable cut of the cloth.<p>In recent months the mobile telephone has begun to rehabilitateits playboy, drug-dealer image and carve for itself an heroicrole as a key tool in the pro-democracy movement. The mobilephone shot to prominence when we listened, rapt, one evening tothe blow-by-blow account of the arrest of a former stategovernor recorded live by the BBC's <i>Focus on Africa</i> radio newsprogramme - via the politician's mobile phone. The ex-governor,Chief Segun Osoba, a one-time BBC correspondent, knew the valueof international news media broadcasting in a country wherelocal media are severely restricted. He had phoned the BBC assoon as he was arrested. The military Government chafed atWestern media imperialism but there were few Nigerians thatevening who remained unaware of the arrest of one of thecountry's leading pro-democracy activists. After that incidentthat security police learned to search the robes of politicaldetainees for their mobile phones. <p>The mobile phone was also the glue which held the pro-democracyoil workers' strike together from June to September. The strikeleaders played cat-and-mouse with Nigerian security operativesand co-ordinated the strike by phone. They weren't a naturaltool for the cash-strapped trade unionists. Journalists phoningone prominent strike leader would have to have their questionswell-prepared and brief, as he would only allow two minutes foreach interview. The union couldn't afford to pay the exorbitantcharges for receiving calls charged by the telephone parastatal.<p>It is unfortunate, but trifling, that one by-product of the endof the pro-democracy strike is that mobile phone-users inNigeria will once again run the risk of being identified asfraudsters and drug-barons instead of men and women of politicalpolitical principles.  Those involved in the political struggle have had their bank balances drained by months of activism.  They couldn't afford to use mobile phones even if they had them.  Sad really that such a useful technology may once again become identified with the affluence that accompanies such dubious life-styles.<p><i><b>Elizabeth Obadina</b> is a freelance journalist who writes for the <b>NI</b> every month about life in Lagos.</i><p>©Copyright New Internationalist 1994<hr><pre><a href="index.html#NItop1"><img src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="NIissue262.html"><img src="ni_pix/niunsymbol.gif"> NI Issue 262 Contents</a><hr></body></html>

ACTIONAID RESPONDS TO NEW OECD REPORT</font></h2>
<font face="arial, helvetica">



ACTIONAID has dismissed an 'action agenda' set out in the latest OECD annual report as
pure rhetoric.  The charity says that the world's richest governments are using a rise in
private investment in some developing countries as an excuse to slash overall aid budgets.<p>

The principal goal of the 'action agenda', set by member governments of the OECD's
Development Assistance Committee (DAC), is "a reduction by one half in the proportion
of people living in extreme poverty by 2015".* <p> 

Yet the new 1996 Development Cooperation annual report highlights the trend of an
increase in flows of foreign investment to developing countries whilst official aid is on the
decline.  The report itself warns that:<p>

<blockquote>
"A continuation of that trend could be fatal to the achievement of
development goals."
</blockquote><p>

Raj Thamotheram, a spokesperson from ACTIONAID said:  "Relying on
private investment to improve the lives of the world's poorest people is
certainly not an 'action' plan.  This complacency by the world's richest
governments will not reduce global poverty and could threaten some of the
progress made over the past decades.  To call this an 'action agenda' is
naive and shortsighted."<p> 

ACTIONAID believes that this is a serious threat to development because:<p>

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is concentrated on a small number of
relatively wealthy countries © not the poorest.  For example sub Saharan
Africa receives only around 5% of total FDI even when developing countries receive FDI there is little evidence that the
poorest people benefit since financial flows tend to respond to market
signals not necessarily human needs.<p>


In real terms the total volume of overseas development assistance from DAC donors fell by 9% in 1995.  UK aid dropped from 0.31% of gnp in 1994 to 0.28% in 1995.<p>

<title>CALL FOR CHARITY HEALTH CHECK TO HELP THE PUBLIC</title>

<h2><font face="arial, helvetica">CALL FOR CHARITY HEALTH CHECK TO HELP THE PUBLIC</font></h2>
<font face="arial, helvetica">
ACTIONAID today called for charities to put greater effort into helping the public
choose which charities to support.  The call comes at the beginning of the
"Christmas giving season".  It also comes on the day ACTIONAID has been
shortlisted for an award at the Charities Annual Reports and Accounts Awards
organised by the Charities Aid Foundation and the Institute of Chartered
Accountants.   
<p>

Dominic Byrne, Head of Communications at ACTIONAID, says:  "Charities
need to take a consumer perspective.  We want to encourage the public to
ask questions of charities before they donate.  We've included a 
checklist of standards in our annual report.  As far as we know, 
no other charity annual report takes this approach and we want to 
encourage this "charity healthcheck" approach to help the public choose
who to support".
<p>

ACTIONAID's list of standards reflects the charity's specific policies on matters
such as reserve levels, staffing, mailing lists, and supporter feedback.  The charity
points out that appropriate policies will vary from charity to charity but in effect
questions on these areas should be asked of all charities.  The standards answer
questions such as "how effective is a charity's spending on fundraising?", "what
is a charity's policy on reserves?" (see attached sheet for a fuller list).
The initiative has been welcomed by independent voices in the charity world. 
Stephen Lee, Director of the Institute of Fundraising Managers,
commented: "I hope this checklist initiative will set a trend among
charities.  It is especially welcome since it draws the public's attention to
a range of charity governance issues, from policy on unsolicited direct
mail to open disclosure of complaint levels, that often get overlooked".
<p>

ACTIONAID hopes that its initiative will stimulate debate among charities and
wider consumer bodies.  Sheila McKechnie, Director of the Consumer's Association and      
        previously director of the charity Shelter, points out:  "As 
        people receive requests for donations to charities, more questions get         
        asked about how to decide. A number of different organisations are    
        looking at ways in which donors can make an informed choice.  There are
        no easy answers and I am aware it is a sensitive subject.  However, I
        think all charities will in future have to provide some kind of               
        performance related information.  I welcome this and all the various   
        discussions taking place about how best to do it".

<p>

ACTIONAID's move to include a checklist of its own standards in its annual
report is part of a wider move by the charity to make its annual reporting more
informative.  The report's financial summary, for example, includes a glossary of
terms designed to help make it easy for the public to understand its accounts.

<h2 align=center>ACTIONAID ACCUSES MULTINATIONALS OF KEEPING MILLIONS HUNGRY</h2>
<p>Today, as the world's governments meet on the first day of the World Food Summit in Rome,
ACTIONAID has issued a report which says that the current global trading system and the
activities of multinational companies are helping to keep 800 million people hungry.  The charity
says that increasingly global trade is undermining indigenous food production.
<p>
Government representatives attending the Summit have stated that their goal is to reduce the
number of chronically malnourished people by half.  But the charity says that they are likely to fail
because they have decided not to include the main causes of 'food insecurity', poverty and "free
trade", on the agenda.  

<p>ACTIONAID's report, <i>'Hunger and the Global Agenda: Who wins, who loses, who cares?' </i> says
that global trade is producing winners and losers  the losers usually being the world's poorest
people.  Research gathered by ACTIONAID from some of the 22 countries where it is working
showed that:
<ul><li>in Kenya the removal of price controls has led to small farmers being forced to sell
off their crops at low prices, because of debt commitments and lack of storage
facilities, and later buying back the same commodities at higher prices for their own use; <p><li>in Sierra Leone the effects of tobacco cultivation have exhausted the land in one
district.  The area was once forested but because large quantities of firewood are
needed for tobacco curing it has been left bare, rocky and incapable of supporting
any crops.  Extensive use of chemicals has polluted the water.</ul><p>

The report goes on to include examples of how global trade has resulted in some markets being
dominated by a small number of multinationals:
 90% of global commodities like wheat, corn and rice are marketed by just six
large transnational companies: Cargill, Continental, Ferruzi, Louis Dreyfus, Bunge &
Born and Cook; <p>in 1992 ATC, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco, had the exclusive right to
purchase tobacco from 16,000 farmers in Sierra Leone;<p>Cargill, a large North American agricultural multinational, has revenues from coffee. sales
alone which are greater than the gross domestic product (GDP) of any one of
the African countries from which it buys coffee beans.<p>Laura Kelly, ACTIONAID's Natural Resources Adviser said: <I> "Of course there are
many factors which result in millions of adults and children going hungry every day. 
But we have to realize that the decisions being made in the board rooms of a few
multinational companies are having a huge impact on the lives of millions of the
world's poorest people. ACTIONAID believes that this Summit is an ideal
opportunity to reject 'business as usual' and set up controls so that global trade does
not mean huge profits for a small number and hunger for millions."</i><p>

ACTIONAID believes that any reduction of global hunger will depend on changes of policies at
national and international levels.  The charity has written to MPs to call for the following actions:<p><ul>
<li>a parliamentary inquiry into the British Government trade policy and the operations of
UK based multinational companies on food security for the poorest people;<p><li>the establishment of a new independent body that monitors and controls the
activities of multinational companies and that tracks the impact of globalisation of
agricultural trade upon the poor; <p><li>a commitment from governments, including the UK, to implement the Summit's
recommendation to promote agriculture that supports livelihoods, contributes to food
security for the poorest and does not damage the environment.</ul><p><center><hr width=71%></center>The report, <b>'Hunger and the Global Agenda: Who wins, who loses, who cares?'</b> is available from

<h2 align=center>POLITICIANS UNITE TO EXPLODE THIRD WORLD MYTHS</h2>


Overseas Development Minister, Baroness Chalker and opposition
spokespeople, Clare Short MP
and Emma Nicholson MP, have joined forces to launch a new report from the charity ACTIONAID
which examines five of the most common myths and stereotypes voiced in Britain about third
world poverty.  It is the first time that the three have shared any platform.

<p>The report, <i>Fact or Fiction?</i>, challenges a range of negative views held by people in Britain about
third world poverty which are often untrue.  The report analyses statements such as:<p><ul>

<li>
"nothing ever changes for the better in the third world"<p><li>
"people in the third world are poor because they have too many children"</ul><p>In her introduction to Fact or Fiction?  TV journalist, Zeinab Badawi says these stereotypes
<i>"...contribute to an unjust view of the third world which ultimately reinforces prejudicial policies
towards the poorest countries and poverty itself".</i>   Fact or Fiction? contradicts each stereotype
with hard evidence in the report.  For example:

<p><ul><li>
official trends on life expectancy, infant mortality and education show dramatic progress;

<p><li>
poverty is a causal factor in population growth rather than the other way round. </ul><p>
Breaking the cycle of rapid population growth and poverty requires improved
conditions for the survival of children and greater choice for women. <p>Nigel Twose, ACTIONAID's Programme Development Director said:  <i>"It's not surprising that the public may hold these perceptions when they usually only
hear about the disasters which happen in developing countries.  The reality on the
ground is quite different.  For example ACTIONAID's new approach to teaching reading
and writing, called REFLECT, is producing remarkable results.  That's why it's
disappointing that these 'myths' are still popular.  They are harmful, not just because
they are wrong but because they can affect policies and attitudes towards poverty."</i><p><center><hr width=71%></center>The report, <b>Fact or Fiction? Common perceptions of third world poverty </b>

<h2 align=center>The Prince of Wales becomes Patron of ACTIONAID</h2>


HRH The Prince of Wales has accepted an invitation to become Royal Patron of ACTIONAID. In his first
annual message for the charity, The Prince of Wales expresses his delight at becoming Patron and
emphasises the need for a more broad-based approach to world poverty that moves away from a
narrow 'economic' view. He points out that:

<p><i>"The causes of poverty are not straightforward, they are not just a matter of economics, and
they
cannot be solved just by the generosity of more privileged societies." </i>

<p>Instead, he says, governments and individuals have "a common responsibility to tackle poverty in
all its
forms".

<p>Prince Charles highlights the importance of making improvements in people's living conditions:

<p><i>"What could be more vital for every human being, and for maintaining the proper dignity of
life, than
clean water and adequate food; what could be more important than ensuring basic health and education
for every child, no matter what his or her circumstances?"</i>

<p>The Prince notes "the sheer scale of what remains to be done as poverty deepens, for example,
among so many people in sub-Saharan Africa" but emphasises that "real, enduring improvements" can be
achieved by "unlocking the potential that can be found in all communities".

<p>John Batten, Chief Executive of ACTIONAID, echoed the Prince's message:

<p><i>"All too often world progress and development is viewed in very narrow terms. We hear about
indices such as the Dow Jones or the FTSE every day but we don't give the same attention to what is
happening to world poverty or quality of life. The Prince of Wales is also right to point to the
responsibilities and achievements of people in the third world itself. It is their ideas and
priorities that are
the building blocks of lasting progress."</i>

The charity accuses the UK government of misusing aid by prioritising wealthier countries, such as those in Eastern Europe, and funding projects which are not designed to reduce poverty.<p>The report, The Reality of Aid 1996, is prepared by a consortium of independent bodies from all 21 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  The report, which coincides with the release in Paris of the latest figures from the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC), says that:<blockquote>"Too much aid is being squandered by governments on projects which have more to do with commercial and political advantage than poverty eradication.  Aid must be targeted where the need is greatest with clear objectives and clearly defined responsibilities for government departments (page 3)." </blockquote><p>ACTIONAID believes that first and foremost aid should go the world's poorest people and more aid has to be devoted to basic human needs: primary health care and basic education.  Funding to these areas is known to bring long-term benefits to the poor.  <p>The Reality of Aid reports that during 1991/92 aid to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries totalled £86 million.  By 1994/5 this figure had risen to £240 million - one tenth of the entire aid budget.*  The following projects received funding from the UK government aid budget:<ul><li>	"...help to Balkan Bulgarian Airlines to prepare for possible privatisation and has 	funded Job Ownership Limited to develop employee share ownership buy-out skills"<p><li>	(in Slovakia) "...a consultant to act as co-producer of a series of short television films on the stock market"											<p><li>	"a second in-country Parliamentary workshop, to follow one held in 1993 when a substantial cross-party group from Westminster went to Romania to discuss Parliamentary practice".**</ul><p>If this £240 million had been used to fund basic needs in developing countries it could have provided:<ul><li>a lifetime's supply of clean water for 24 million people in Africa;<p><li>	primary education for 5.9 million children in India.</ul><p>The Reality of Aid reveals that the UK government has made some progress towards a better poverty focus in its aid programme, both in terms of management and targeting.  This makes the increasing misuse of the aid budget for work in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union unconnected with poverty reduction even more alarming.  <p>ACTIONAID points out that the squeeze on poorer countries caused by the misuse of aid is compounded by aid falling to the lowest level ever recorded.  Next year UK aid will be just 0.26 per cent of GNP and developing countries will face a three year cut of 16 per cent by 1998/9 - nearly £323 million.  The report also says that 20 per cent of the world's population are living in absolute poverty, living on less than one dollar a day, and this figure is rising.  <p><blockquote>Nigel Twose, ACTIONAID Director of Programme Development said: "The government has gone on record in stating that the purpose of their aid budget is to 'reduce poverty' and so it is inexcusable for aid to fund any project which does not have this as a primary objective.  The tragedy is that aid does work, as evidenced by the poverty focused projects supported by the government.  That is what makes this growing misuse so alarming."</blockquote><p><hr><p><b>Note to Editors:</b><br>Reality of Aid 1996 is the fourth in a series of annual reports which provides an independent analysis of official aid from 21 countries in the OECD. <p>ACTIONAID works in 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, helping to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for people living in the world's poorest communities.<p><b>For further information:</b><br>Jenny Driscoll, Press Officer - 0171 281 4101Susannah Cox, Head of Press - 0171 281 4101<p>*	Overseas Development Administration's British Aid Statistics 1990/91 - 1994/95**	Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Know How Fund Annual Report 1993-94<p><hr><center><TABLE BORDER=0 width=500 bgcolor=#FFFFCC cellpadding=10><TR><TH><br><img src="table1.gif" width=483 height=243><p><img src="table2.gif" width=483 height=228><p><img src="table3.gif" width=484 height=173><br></TH></TR></TABLE><center><p><hr><h2>REALITY OF AID 1996 - Summary</h2><p>Aid provided by the industrialised countries of the North to the developing world is in crisis.  The amount of aid pledged by the North has fallen to its lowest level for 20 years.  Equally worrying, there is no indication that the aid that is still being provided is reaching the world's poorest people.<h3>GENERAL SUMMARY</h3><p>1. Aid falls to its lowest level for 20 years.  In 1994, in spite of commitments by donor member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with the exception of the US, to maintain aid targets, more than a third of donors cut their aid.  1995 levels look to fall further still.<p><ul><li>Least developed countries (LDC) and other low income countries have seen aid fall by a total of 7% since 1990.<p><li>Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa has fallen by $670 million since 1991 (more than the entire national income of Sierra Leone).<p><li>New players are further diluting aid delivery. Vietnam, South Africa and  Cambodia have leapt to the top of some donors' tables.<p><li>Aid to Eastern Europe and North Africa from the EU is now equal to all EU aid going to Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific combined.</ul><p>2. Increased instability in the post cold war world has meant a rise in the percentage of aid spent on emergency relief.  10% of OECD donor aid is now spent on emergency relief.<p>3. Changes in reporting rules mean that support for refugees at home in donor countries (for the first year) can be counted as ODA, reducing the funds available for poverty eradication by almost $1 billion.<p>4. The report concludes that there are basic strands to the worldwide commitment to eradicate poverty.<p><ul><li>To be effective, aid must complement wider government efforts to address social development.  Investing in human capacity is an indispensable part of the route to economic development.  Key areas of social investment are education, health, water and sanitation.<p><li>OECD donor Governments should be able to answer the question, "how much of aid money gets to the people who are in the greatest need?".  The complexities of measuring aid allocation makes it difficultto answer this question clearly, but better information should be available.  Donor reporting is improving, but this improvement reveals how little aid is reaching those key areas of social investment. Current investment is tiny, showing 0.1% of total aid going to basic education, and 0.3% of total aid going to basic health.<p><li>There has to be local "ownership" of development projects for those projects to be successful.  External control and dependency are big obstacles to effective aid programmes.<p><li>There is little capacity for evaluation of the aid that OECD countries provide.  Over $5 billion per year for the last five years has been spent on programme aid - aid designed to change the recipient country's macro-economic and political structure, without any mechanism to determine whether it does harm or good.</ul><p>5. Commercial pressures mean that much aid is being squandered on projects with political and economic advantage taking precedence over poverty reduction.<p>6. Increased private aid and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is no substitute for falling aid.  There is little evidence that FDI is targeting unmet demand for basic needs of food, education, primary health care, family planning or sanitation.<p><h3>UK OVERVIEW</h3><p>1. In 1996 UK aid will fall to the lowest level ever recorded.<p>2. By 1998 aid to the world's poorest people (LDC/other low-income countries) will have fallen by 16% from the 1994/5 level.<p>3. An increasing percentage of all UK aid is being channelled through the EC and other multilateral aid mechanisms.  This means that the percentage of bilateral aid - the money over which the UK maintains the most control - is shrinking significantly.<p>4. Although making some progress from a low base on improving the poverty focus of the aid programme in terms of management and targeting the majority of UK aid spending does not directly reach the world's poorest people with a much greater emphasis being placed on economic reform rather than meeting basic needs.<p>5. Aid to sub-Saharan Africa - the world's poorest region - fell by 18% from 1994/5 to 1997/8, while Eastern Europe/The Former Soviet Union received the equivalent of 11% of the aid going to the poorest countries.<p>6. The UK has no way to measure the effectiveness of its aid.  They are unwilling to implement the measurement of either the input - the amount of aid expenditure targeting basic education of health needs or the results - eg, reduction of infant/maternal mortality.<p><hr><p><a href="../home.html"><img src="../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="index.html"><img src="../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><b><li type=square><a href="../home.html">Home Page</a> <litype=square><ahref="../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a> <li type=square><a href="index.html">Latest News</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

<h2 align=center>ACTIONAID worker evacuated from Liberia</h2>


ACTIONAID welcomes the safe return of Peter Crichton, who was evacuated from Liberia in April. 

<p>Peter, from Edinburgh, has been working as ACTIONAID's country representative in Liberia alongside
two other staff since the beginning of March. He says:

<p>
<i>"We're all extremely lucky to have been taken out of Monrovia by the Americans. They launched a
very
impressive evacuation operation. However, our thoughts remain with our local staff members and with
the people of Liberia who are bearing the brunt of this violence. We hope that the country returns to
peace very soon and that aid agencies can get back to work."</i>
<p>

Peter had been researching the potential of a new ACTIONAID programme to rehabilitate primary school
education and to set up a teacher training scheme. Because of the breakdown of security the
assessment mission has been put on hold. However, ACTIONAID will review plans to work in Liberia as
soon
as possible.

<h2 align=center>A breakthrough in world literacy
</h2>


World literacy rates could improve dramatically as a result of a radical new adult literacy programme
launched by ACTIONAID. Pilot trials of the Reflect programme in three continents have shown it to be
two
to three times more effective than conventional approaches to reading and writing.

<p>Reflect abandons the traditional textbook and hands over the curriculum to learners. Participants
of a
Reflect group make up their own learning materials relating to a local issue, for example a calendar
of
childhood illness or a map of crop planting. These materials are used by Reflect teachers to
introduce
numbers and the written word.

<p>Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development, says:

<p><i>"Teaching people to read and write provides them with the means to develop. Reflect is
important
because it enables students to tailor the course to their needs and relate to what they are learning.
I am
delighted that a British charity has taken the initiative in this area and that the Overseas
Development
Administration has been able to play a part by researching the project's effectiveness."</i>

<p>Overall results show that Reflect has a 60-70 per cent success rate when compared with
conventional
adult literacy programmes which stand at around 25 per cent, as measured by the World Bank.

<p>Two years of intensive trials have taken place through ACTIONAID projects in Bangladesh, El
Salvador
and Uganda. 

<p>In Uganda, Reflect classes took place in 65 villages. Enrolment in local schools increased by 20
per cent
and parents in 20 villages set up their own schools and asked for the children to be taught using
this new
method.

<p>One of the key success factors is the way in which Reflect allows class participants to focus
their
reading and writing on local issues of importance to them. This also has a knock-on effect on other
improvements in living conditions. Early evidence from trial areas points to more efficient farming
techniques, improved health care and increased involvement of women in decision making.

<p>Reflect is now being extended to other countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America following
funding
from the World Bank. ACTIONAID is working with governments and other organisations to incorporate the
method into their own education programmes.

<p>According to the World Bank's Review of Priorities in Education 1995, 900 million people
throughout the
world are illiterate. If Reflect was adopted world-wide this figure could be reduced to 3-400
million. 

<p>David Archer, ACTIONAID's Education Advisor who developed Reflect, says:

<p><i>"Most adult literacy programmes are failing. This has led to a tendency in many countries to
teach
children and forget a generation of adults. ACTIONAID believes in education for all. The impact of
Reflect
may go far beyond the field of adult education, affecting approaches to poverty alleviation and
development world-wide."</i>

<p>Over the last 30 years the majority of adult literacy programmes have been disappointing and have
lost the support of donor organisations and governments. David de Ferranti, Director of Human
Development at the World Bank, recently commented: " To find a truly effective approach to literacy
would be like finding a holy grail."

Development education increases public awareness of development issues and builds future support for poverty alleviation. However, its funding from government remains very low. <p>According to the latest available figures, the UK spends less on development education than Ireland, whilst Switzerland spends 16 times more and The Netherlands 23 times more than the UK. (Reality of Aid, 1995) <p>Although development education is a statutory part of the National Curriculum in England and Wales, it is buried within the requirements of other subjects, leaving teachers without clear guidelines. ACTIONAID would welcome the opportunity for reports on development education to be a statutory part of inspection visits by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED). <p>ACTIONAID welcomes the Overseas Development Administration's (ODA's) interest in working with the Department For Education and Employment (DFEE) on development education issues. Earmarked funding from DFEE could play an essential role in supporting teacher training on development education.<p>Although the ODA is now funding more development education work, most of the funding goes to just one organisation - Worldaware. Extending funds to a wider range of organisations would help advance the work of a number of development agencies, including ACTIONAID, as well as education institutions who produce invaluable development education materials.<p>ACTIONAID's development education work<p>ACTIONAID seeks to increase young people's understanding of poverty in developing countries by publishing education resources and providing a range of services to schools and teachers, particularly in-service training.<p>ACTIONAID's <b><a href="../resource/index.html" target="_parent">resources for teachers</a></b> have received awards from the Geographical Association and the Education Television Association. Teachers have described them as "excellent", "relevant and up-to-date", "exciting and user-friendly".<p>Approximately 1,000,000 pupils in over 50 per cent of schools in England and Wales use ACTIONAID materials every year. <p>ACTIONAID was the first NGO to produce materials to support the 'distant locality' requirements of the geography National Curriculum for 5-11 year olds, and the first to publish a CD-ROM on development issues for schools.<p>It is no coincidence that the countries which have invested in development education also operate high quality aid programmes. Public attitude studies over the years have pointed to the correlation between knowledge about developing countries and positive attitudes towards development co-operation.<hr><p><p><b><a href="../lives/index.html">Changing lives:</a></b> find out about the experiences of people whose lives havechanged withACTIONAID's help<p><hr><p><a href="../home.html"><img src="../pix/home.gif" width=46 height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><img src="../pix/globe1.gif" width=46 height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="flashback.html"><img src="../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><b><li type=square><a href="../home.html">Home Page</a> <li type=square><ahref="../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a> <li type=square><a href="flashback.html">NewsFlashback</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

<h2 align=center>British aid in crisis</h2>

<p><b> - ACTIONAID's reaction to Baroness Chalker's speech on the Overseas Development
Administration's Fundamental Expenditure Review</b><br>
14.2.96

<p>ACTIONAID believes Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development, is putting a brave face on
a
bleak situation.

<p>Baroness Chalker's presentation, 'ODA: New Aims and Priorities', announces the outcome of the
ODA's
Fundamental Expenditure Review (FER), the first major review in 20 years. The speech follows a report
by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which states that the world's
richest governments have cut their aid to the lowest level for 20 years (as a proportion of Gross
National
Product).

<p>The FER reveals that: 

<p><ul><li>bilateral aid will decline by £660 million at the end of the decade (it is currently £1.05
billion) 

<p><li>bilateral aid to Africa will fall by 18.4 per cent

<p><li>a new 'concentration policy' will target 20 countries rather than focusing aid to help the
poorest
people

<p><li>the ODA's running costs will be frozen and staff numbers will fall
</ul>

<p>Nigel Twose, Director of Programme Development at ACTIONAID, says: 

<p><i>"British aid is now in crisis. Without significant increases in aid, the quality and reach of
the UK aid
programme will continue to fall to such an extent that the viability of the whole aid programme is
under
threat. The ODA faces stark choices about the future direction of British aid. Unfortunately the
future
strategy outlined in the FER is more about coping with a much reduced aid programme than any real
commitment to taking up the challenge of rising global poverty." </i>

<h2 align=center>The social summit: a 20/20 vision
</h2>
16.2.95


<p>The forthcoming World Summit for Social Development presents a major opportunity for the
international community to commit itself to the urgent task of eradicating global poverty and
beginning a
new era of North-South development co-operation. This opportunity must be grasped by the British
government. 

<p>ACTIONAID proposes a practical and realisable two-stage plan for British aid under which Britain
would at
first meet the Summit's call for 20 per cent of aid to go to basic needs, thereby:
<ul>
<p><li>providing a basic education to nearly five million extra girls

<p><li>providing over 30 million people in low income countries with a package of essential health
services
</ul>
<p>
As the World Summit for Social Development convenes in Copenhagen, attended by over 100 heads of
state and government, the international community is faced with a clear choice. It could commit
itself to
implementing an integrated anti-poverty strategy to improve the lives of the one fifth of the world's
population living in poverty. Alternatively, it could produce fine words and declarations which
result in little
practical progress towards 'a new era of international co-operation'. If the second path is taken,
the
evidence suggests that over 300 million more people will be living in absolute poverty in 10 years
time.

<p>The Social Summit is an unprecedented opportunity for real progress to be made towards eradicating
poverty. It is the first UN summit concerned specifically with the eradication of poverty and calls
on the
international community to commit itself to an integrated anti-poverty programme. It emphasises the
dual responsibility between North and South in the task of defeating poverty. This task is more
urgent
than ever since the number of people living in absolute poverty is increasing by around 30 million
people
each year. 


<h3>An opportunity for the British government?</h3>

<p>The Social Summit will consider many different, inter-related issues which can only be tackled by
Northern and Southern governments taking joint responsibility for them. There is, however, one clear
area of policy reform on the agenda of the Social Summit on which the British government can take
action and demonstrate a clear political commitment to the Summit's goals. This concerns the call for
20
per cent of donors' aid budgets to be devoted to basic needs, such as primary health care, basic
education, safe water and adequate sanitation. The 20 per cent target is the agreed position of the
UNDP, Unicef, Unesco, Unfpa and WHO. ACTIONAID believes that at the Summit, the British government
should commit itself to reaching the 20 per cent target for aid specifically called for by these
organisations.


<h3>Why emphasise basic needs?</h3>

<p>The Summit's call for the greater provision of basic needs - both by developing country
governments
and overseas aid donors - is an approach to reducing poverty and promoting development shared by
ACTIONAID. There are two main reasons for this:
<ul>
<p><li>Firstly, it is a humanitarian strategy aimed directly at the needs of the poorest, most
disadvantaged groups in society. It contributes directly to reducing poverty and providing the
essentials
of life, such as basic education and primary health care.

<p><li>Secondly, it makes economic sense since development cannot be promoted or sustained unless
there is long-term investment in the basic needs of the poor; this is especially true since the poor
often
comprise a substantial proportion of a population. 
</ul>
<p>In education, for example, there is a high rate of economic and social return to be gained by
directly
investing in the poor in developing countries. The World Bank's "experience indicates... that no
country has
been able to take off economically with a literacy rate of less than 50 per cent". Yet around half of
the
world's low income countries have literacy rates below this level. Investing in basic education -
which
primarily benefits the poorest people - is more beneficial than investing in higher-level education -
from
which the poor are usually excluded - since it is "well-known that tertiary education yields the
lowest social
rate of return". 


<h3>20 per cent for basic needs</h3>

<p>The Summit presents an opportunity for the British government to commit itself to increase the
proportion of aid going to basic needs to at least 20 per cent. ACTIONAID believes that the British
government should implement a two-stage plan to achieve this.


<h3>The two-stage plan for basic needs</h3>

<p>In the first stage, lasting from 1995-2000, Britain would increase the proportion of its bilateral
aid to
basic needs to at least 20 per cent (under the UNDP definition).

<p>In the second stage, lasting from 2000-2005, Britain would build on this increase and raise the
proportion devoted to basic needs to at least one third of bilateral aid (under the UNDP definition). 

<p>Currently, the proportion of Britain's bilateral aid devoted to basic needs is very low: the UNDP
estimates it at 6.6 per cent for 1988-91 (the most recent figures); while the government itself
admits
that the figure is just 10.7 per cent for 1992/93, using a slightly wider definition. 

<p>The figure of 6.6 per cent is the only internationally comparable figure for the proportion of
British
bilateral aid going to basic needs. It means that if Britain increased the proportion of bilateral
aid devoted
to basic needs to 20 per cent, an extra £160-170 million a year would go to such vital services as
primary
health care and basic education.

<p>Where could the extra £160-170 million come from? ACTIONAID believes there are several elements in
the aid budget which are of less value in reducing poverty than a direct focus on basic needs. We
therefore
make three suggestions for the source of that extra funding which we urge the government to consider:

<p><ul><li>Firstly, there is the amount devoted to the Aid and Trade Provision (ATP), worth £85
million in
1993/94. Several studies show the poor developmental value of many ATP projects, of which the Pergau
dam is the most notorious. If the money spent on ATP went on basic needs, the government would be
half way towards reaching the 20 per cent first stage target.

<p><li>Secondly, some of the extra resources could also come from the amount currently directed to
relatively rich countries with relatively low poverty levels. £68 million of aid went to upper-middle
income
and high income countries in 1993/94. These are countries with a per capita income of $2,696-8,355,
which
compares to low income countries' per capita income of under $676. ACTIONAID believes that these
countries are worthy recipients of aid, but their relative wealth suggests that other countries and
projects should receive priority support from British aid.

<p><li>Thirdly is the issue of resources going to the former Soviet bloc countries. In 1993/94, total
aid to
these countries amounted to £243 million, or 11.2 per cent of all British aid. ACTIONAID believes
that,
especially at a time of declining aid levels, first call on these resources should be the poorest
countries in
the developing world.
</ul>

<h3>Increasing aid resources</h3>

<p>The Social Summit's Draft Programme of Action also contains a call for donors to reach the 0.7 per
cent of GNP target for aid. The fact that the number of people living in absolute poverty is rising
shows
that it remains essential for donors to move towards this target. 

<p>The figure of 0.7 per cent GNP was first adopted by the UN in 1970 and by the British government
in
1974 - will the government set a firm date for reaching it, say by 2000, the 30th anniversary of its
adoption by the UN and the eve of a new millennium of development co-operation? 

<p>The first step towards this target should be for the government to reach the European Union
average
- 0.43 per cent of GNP in 1992, compared to 0.31 per cent for Britain. ACTIONAID is calling on the
government to set a clear timetable for firstly reaching the EU average for aid and, secondly,
reaching the
UN target.

<p>
What could be achieved if spending on basic needs increased to 20 per cent?

<p>A real impact on the lives of many poor people could be made if Britain increased the proportion
of its
aid devoted to basic needs to 20 per cent. Here are just two examples of what the extra £160-170
million
could achieve:

<p><ul><li>Britain could increase eleven-fold the amount spent on basic education (which was just
£15.8
million in 1992/93). The Overseas Development Administration states that raising the primary school
enrolment of girls to equal that of boys in the low income countries would involve educating an extra
25
million girls a year at a cost of around £938 million. With the extra resources devoted to basic
needs,
Britain could fund almost a fifth of the total costs of this programme and reach nearly five million
new
pupils. 

<p><li>Britain could provide over 30 million people in low income countries with a package of
essential health
services. The package includes family planning services, care for common illnesses which account for
millions of child deaths each year, pregnancy-related care which reduces maternal deaths and the
control
of sexually-transmitted diseases. The World Bank estimates the cost of such a health package as $8
(£5.70) per person in low income countries.

<h2 align=center>How focused on poverty reduction is British aid?
</h2>
<b> - A briefing for the House of Commons debate on the government's spending plans</b><br>
21.10.94

<p>
<i>"My duty - both to the recipients of our aid and to British taxpayers - is to ensure that our aid
is
directed to where it is needed... and where it can be effectively used."</i>
Baroness Chalker, House of Lords, 2 March 1994.

<p>At a time of parliamentary scrutiny of the government's aid spending plans, ACTIONAID believes it
appropriate to consider what should be the primary purpose of aid: its focus on poverty reduction.

<p>Last year, ACTIONAID published the results of a parliamentary poll showing that 82 per cent of MPs
believe it important that the aid programme give greater attention to basic needs - such as basic
education, primary health care and clean water. The poll also revealed that, on average, MPs said
that
48.9 per cent of all aid should be spent on basic needs. We contrasted this view with United Nations
figures
showing that less than seven per cent of the government's bilateral aid is spent on basic needs. 

<p>In an interview on BBC Radio 5 , the Overseas Development Minister, Baroness Chalker, asserted
that
what ACTIONAID said on Britain's aid focus on basic needs was "plain wrong". "Even on the narrowest
definition", the Minister continued, "we spend over 20 per cent of our bilateral programme on basic
needs." 

<p>
<h3>What is the reality of the aid programme's focus on basic needs?</h3>

<p>
<b>The importance of basic needs</b>

<p>With 1.3 billion people living in absolute poverty and the number rising by around 26 million
people a
year, there is a pressing need to ensure that government aid is effectively targeted on the reduction
of
poverty.

<p>It is now widely accepted that the most effective way of reducing poverty is to focus aid on basic
needs. In its 1990 report on poverty, for example, the World Bank called upon the international
community to implement a strategy requiring the "widespread provision to the poor of basic social
services, especially primary education, primary health care, and family planning". If this strategy
were
implemented, the Bank argued, absolute poverty could be significantly reduced. Such a bottom-up,
people-centred approach is recognised to be central to promoting economic development. 

<p>
<b>How does Britain perform on basic needs?</b>

<p>The government states that "the aid programme's greatest priority is reducing poverty". In
practice,
however, the available evidence shows that British aid is very poorly targeted on poverty reduction.

<p>(a) The bilateral aid focus on basic needs

<p>In answer to a parliamentary question, the government stated that "a minimum" of £111 million of
Britain's bilateral aid was focused on basic needs provision in 1992-93. Given that total bilateral
aid in
1992-93 was £1.03 billion, this means that just 10.7 per cent of bilateral aid went to basic needs,
by the
government's own figures.

<p>Estimates provided by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) indicate that Britain's
performance on basic needs is worse than this. According to UNDP, just 6.6 per cent of Britain's
bilateral
aid went to basic needs in 1989-91 (the latest available figures). This figure was even lower than
the
previous estimate made by UNDP for 1988-9, which was 8.8 per cent. (Unicef estimates on basic needs
are
taken from the UNDP).

<p>(b) The multilateral aid focus on basic needs

<p>As far as ACTIONAID is aware, there are no sources which provide information on the proportion of
Britain's multilateral aid which goes to basic needs. The indications are, however, that the focus is
likely to
be little better than in the bilateral part of the programme. For example, nearly half of Britain's
multilateral funds go the European Union. The EU provides no statistics on the proportion of its aid
spent
on basic needs, but its overall focus on poverty is generally held to be very poor. The second
largest
recipient of Britain's multilateral funds - accounting for nearly a third of multilateral aid, or a
quarter of a
billion pounds - is the World Bank Group. Yet the UNDP estimates that just 10.2 per cent of World
Bank aid
is focused on basic needs.

<p>Overall, the evidence suggests that the government's focus on basic needs is far less than the
government claims. ACTIONAID believes it is unacceptable for the government to claim that the aid
programme's greatest priority is reducing poverty at the same time that such a low proportion of aid
is
actually allocated to basic needs. ACTIONAID believes that to make a real impact on poverty reduction
a
greater proportion of aid should go to meeting basic needs.

<p>
<b>The future of aid to basic needs?</b>

<p>There are some signs of an improvement in the poverty focus of British aid. For example, the ODA
has
begun to improve the currently very poor focus on aid to basic education (primary schooling and adult
literacy) within its overall aid to education. It has also recently introduced a mechanism - the
Policy
Information Marker System - for measuring the impact of aid projects against a number of objectives,
including poverty reduction. 

<p>These measures are welcome, if long overdue, but they are insufficient to achieve a genuinely
comprehensive impact on poverty: for this, a wholesale reordering of priorities within the aid
programme
is required - with direct poverty reduction at the very heart of the aid programme.

<p>

<p><font size=4><font size=+2>L</font>iteracy in the developing world is  far more complex than
reading and writing, says David Archer. And we need to concentrate on the people most difficult to
reach - adults.</font>
<hr>
<p>
Educationalists estimate that a child needs between three and four years of schooling to acquire
basic reading and writing skills. <p>
In the UK, our children spend at least 11 years in school. In the 20 countries of Africa, Asia and
Latin America where ACTIONAID works, the average child receives just over two years of schooling and
many have no access to education at all <b><a href="#box1">(see box 1)</a></b>. Most fail to become
literate at school and enter adulthood unable to read and write.<p>
In Bangladesh, for example, the adult literacy rate stands at around 35 per cent. Though the country
has more literate people than England and sustains more than a hundred national newspapers, the
problem is one of scale and power. <p>
The literate society of Bangladesh is concentrated in urban areas. The poor, living in marginal urban
areas or villages, live in a different world where the written word is scarcely to be seen. Here, the
local school, if there is one, may be the only place where books can be found. People engage in their
daily lives with little or no need for reading and writing.<p>
In such conditions, adults may see little point in literacy or in literacy training. Recent research
by the World Bank suggests that adult literacy programmes have an average effectiveness rate of just
12.5 per cent. Half of the adults who enrol drop out within a few weeks. Of those who do continue,
half fail to complete the course - and of those who do graduate, half lose their skills through
disuse within a year.<p>
This disillusionment with the value of adult literacy has made many government and international
agencies ignore adults and instead target scarce resources at educating children. But this is not
working. Despite investments, primary school enrolment has stagnated, and in many countries children
are dropping out of school in vast numbers.<p>
To increase enrolment, governments are spending many of their resources on building schools.
ACTIONAID research in Kenya, though, shows that simply building schools is insufficient, so ACTIONAID
now focuses more on areas such as promoting pre-school education; on-the-job training for teachers;
training parent-teacher associations; and developing non-formal education for children who drop out
of school.
However, focusing on children alone will not solve the overall problem of illiteracy. Adult literacy
is vitally important because it is adults who decide whether to send their children to school - and
this is a difficult choice when children could otherwise be earning an income for the family. Unless
adults understand the   benefits of education they will not take the risk - and they will not
understand simply by being told.
Those benefits are numerous. Literate parents are not only more likely to send their children to
school but will also take a more active interest in the school (for example, through parent-teacher
associations) and reinforce their children's education at home. <p>
There are other benefits. Literate farmers tend to have more access to credit and training, and are
often more productive; literate women are more likely to immunise children and to know about basic
child healthcare and nutrition. More deeply, the process of becoming literate often builds
confidence, prompting people to overcome past fears and feelings of powerlessness.<p>
For literacy to be made attractive to adults it must be made relevant to their lives and to the wider
process of development. The Brazilian educator Paulo Freire identified this may years ago, saying
that literacy is not just about reading words but about understanding reality.<p>
The struggle for day to day survival means that the poor rarely have the opportunity to reflect upon
their lives and discuss the causes of their problems or possible solutions. A literacy class can be a
valuable space to do so (perhaps most of all for women, for whom it is sometimes their first
experience of being in a community group).<p>
 Where literacy programmes have been linked to reflection and active discussion on local issues, they
have often acted as a catalyst for people taking greater control of their own development. This in
turn can make the literacy skills relevant within their daily lives. <p>
However, most literacy programmes still fail to do this. The biggest block is in teaching methods.
Literacy teachers are usually poorly trained and yet they are expected to start interesting
discussions using just pictures from a basic textbook and a list of questions. The common response is
an awkward silence from adults who do not see the relevance of the issues to their lives. Teachers
fall back on what they know from their own experience in school and focus just on the technical
skills of reading and writing - teaching the adults like children, without any reference to life
experience. Classes become both difficult and boring, and the adults start to drop out.<p>
It is as a response to this situation that  ACTIONAID has developed a new teaching method for adult
literacy, called Reflect.<p>
Reflect has been piloted in Uganda, El Salvador and Bangladesh, and is proving extremely successful
in both teaching literacy and linking literacy to local development. The method has already spread to
10 other countries and has been taken up by many other organisations. It is hoped that this new
method will revitalise adult literacy work internationally and will help to convince governments of
the critical importance of investing in the education of adults as well as children.<p>

<h3>Reflect</h3>

<p>In a Reflect programme, there is no textbook and no pre-printed materials other than a guide for
the literacy 'facilitators'. Each literacy 'circle' develops its own   learning materials through the
construction of maps, matrices, calendars and     diagrams that represent  everyday events and
issues, and use the existing       knowledge of learners. <p>
These 'graphics' might include maps of households, land use or land tenancy    or calendars of gender
workloads, illnesses or income. Each graphic is initially     constructed on the ground, using
locally available materials and local designed picture cards. Large copies of these graphics are then
made on paper and key  words are gradually introduced, all taken from the immediate lives of the
learners. <p>

</TD></TR></TABLE></TD>
</TR></TABLE><p>
By the end of the literacy course, each circle will have produced a range of 30 graphics. Each
learner will have a copy of these in their books, together with phrases they have written, so that
they produce a real document - not just an exercise book full of copied scribbles. The graphics
become a permanent record for communities, giving them a basis on which to plan their own development
with the minimum of manipulation by external agencies.<p>

<h2>Game for anything</h2>

<font face=ariel, helvetica>
<b>There's one sure thing about children all over the world - they'll
make a game out of anything.</b><p>

Wherever in the world they live, all children love to play. The
materials might vary, but in many cases the games are extraordinarily
similar. You will find boys and girls skipping, flying kites, playing
football and enjoying different versions of catch, marbles, jacks or
hopscotch anywhere from Ireland to El Salvador, Kenya and Nepal. <p>

In industrialised countries children often buy plastic playthings like
hoops, balls and dolls. Their peers in rural communities of the
developing world might make their own from readily available natural
resources. In The Gambia, creeping plants such as kaba nomboo and
trees like the batiango with its long, flexible branches are ideal for
making a hoop. You simply cross over the ends and lash them firmly
with a piece of cloth. <p>

For many games, the items are simpler still. Take jumpsticks, or
saltar palos as it's known in Bambamarca, Peru, where each player just
needs a stick for everyone else to jump over. In rural parts of Nepal,
children play dandibio while they are goat herding in the mountains -
they find a little stick and hit it with a bigger stick as far as they
can.

<pre>


</pre><b><font size=2 face=ariel, helvetica>A game of Kabbadi in
Jahasmara Village, Bangladesh.<br>

Somalian boys love to play luuf which requires only a large stone and
a hole in the ground. Whoever manages to throw the stone into the hole
from a specified distance is named "The Chief". <p>

In the provinces of Sierra Leone empty food tins get recycled into
vigorous games played by children of all ages. Bot ki di is temne (one
of the local languages of Sierra Leone) for "put it there". A player
guards a hole half a foot deep with a stick which he uses as a bat.
The rest of the players then try to throw empty tins into the hole
while the player with the stick tries to bat them away.<p> 

A girl from The Gambia watching a game of hopscotch in the UK would be
instantly reminded of padinaydee, a much more sophisticated version.
The grid for hopping (drawn on wet sandy ground in the rainy season)
has 11 "compounds". Once a player has reached the last compound with
her stone or counter and returned successfully with it on her head,
she can "buy" another compound on which only she can land. The game
gets very exciting once several of the compounds are owned and the
girls have to avoid them as they hop and jump around the grid with
their counters on their heads. <p>

The popular Nepalese game carom is reminiscent of pool in the UK,
though played on a large board in place of a table. Instead of potting
balls with cues, coloured disks are flicked into netted holes in the
corners - but the rules are otherwise the same. Also in Nepal baghchal
(literally "tiger and goat") is quite similar to chess. The idea is
for one player's tigers to eat the other player's goats, or the other
player's goats to surround the tigers. In rural areas the board is
drawn on the ground and the players use stones as tigers and goats.
<p>

<b>Holding their breath</b><p>

One popular game throughout Asia is also a national sport. Kabbadi (or
kapardi in Nepal) involves two teams standing at either end of a
pitch, divided by a line. The first player runs to the other side -
while holding their breath and chanting kabbadi - and tries to drag an
opposing player back to their side. So long as player A is on B's
territory the B team can also try to drag A into their side. If player
A starts breathing, they are declared out.<p>

Games represent more than just a bit of fun for children. They can
provide good exercise, learning skills for children with disabilities,
or those who get little access to school - and relaxation after long
hours working at domestic, agricultural or other chores. In regions of
conflict games can play a vital role in helping children to overcome
the trauma of war, or in helping to unite divided communities.
Nicaragua, Burundi and Somaliland are just three countries where
ACTIONAID has facilitated sports and leisure activities as part of its
peace building programmes.<p>

<h2>Fact or Fiction -</h2> 

<b><font size=5 color="#F1B164">"Nothing changes for the better in the
third world"</b></font><p>
<center>
<table width=400 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 border=0>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=250>
<font face=ariel, helvetica>
This gloomy perception, commonly held in the West, is based on
selected facts. But essentially it's fiction. Over the last 30 years,
millions of families in Africa, Asia and Latin America have seen
dramatic improvements in healthcare and education. Life expectancy in
developing countries is now 17 years longer than it was in 1960.
Infant mortality has been halved. Enrolment in primary and secondary
schools is up by nearly 50 per cent. People's lives have changed, for
the better.<p>

So why is all this overlooked? One reason is that "good news" often
fails to get the same attention as bad news. All too often, the only
time a developing country will appear in the news is during an
emergency. Longer-term positive trends don't make dramatic stories -
so they get ignored. <p>

Yet there are plenty of arresting statistics among these trends if we
care to look for them. In the last 30 years, the proportion of the
world's population with access to safe water has almost doubled, from
36 per cent to 70 per cent. For example, in just one project area -
Bhola Island in Bangladesh - ACTIONAID has dug over 1,000 wells,
benefiting over 26,000 families.<p> 


Here's another surprising statistic - despite rapid population growth
and the stereotypical images of third world hunger, on average people
in developing countries are now producing 20 per cent more food than
they were a decade ago. (ACTIONAID has been involved in this
transformation too, providing training, tools, credit and seed in
thousands of projects around the world).<p>

On the other hand, negative images can't all be blamed on the media.
Sadly, while millions of poor people have seen real improvements in
their lives, the number of people living in absolute poverty has
actually increased. These people still lack even basic provisions,
such as clean water, basic health care or access to education. And
there are more such people now than there were 20 years ago,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. And this is why ACTIONAID must
increasingly work with the very poorest people - those who have been
left behind by the advances of the last few decades. <p>

So the figures show how much is left to be done, but they also show
that real change has been achieved. There's no room for complacency -
but none for despair either.<p>

<h3>All change</h3>
<font size=2 face=ariel, helvetica>
Nothing ever changes? Try telling that to Ato Bedru Badlu, who lives
in Koysha, Ethiopia. ACTIONAID has been working in this area since
1992, supported by thousands of people in the UK.<p>

"I have seen many things happening since ACTIONAID began working with
us in Koysha," says Ato. "A health post and a new clinic, a child
literacy programme, an adult literacy programme, road maintenance,
footpath construction, and a scheme organising groups of the poor to
benefit from different credit programmes. <p>

"Also, our Tercha elementary school was being eaten by termites and
was going to fall down, but now it looks like new because it has been
renovated by ACTIONAID. I am a member of the school committee and we
had a serious problem of desks. Now, ACTIONAID has equipped the rooms
which enables us to enrol more children. Not only this but a
veterinary clinic was constructed and equipped with drugs, and our
cattle are getting treatment by a veterinary assistant trained by
ACTIONAID.<p>

"Since joining ochi ditcha (development group) I have had a loan from
ACTIONAID and bought goats. I also got the chance to work in a 'cash
for work' programme, mainly on road building, and was able to increase
my income."<p>

It's hard to imagine any of these activities on News at Ten ("Bong!
Man buys goat. Bong! Ants fail to make school fall down.") but they
make a huge difference to the lives of Ato and thousands of other
Ethiopians. For them, things have really got better - and ACTIONAID
and its supporters have been the catalyst.<p>

<h2>Seam of success</h2>

<font face=ariel, helvetica>
<b>Women in Calcha, Bolivia, are finding a new source of prestige
and income, thanks to ACTIONAID - and 16th century Spanish
miners.</b><p>

<center>
<table width=400 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 border=0>

<td valign=top width=250>

<img hspace=5 vspace=5 height=248 width=180 align=left
src="seam1.jpg">
When Spanish settlers first began mining the Cerro Rico hill which
towers over Potosi in central Bolivia, they couldn't even begin to
guess that their actions would one day help the region's traditional
weavers to survive.<p>

The hill has produced silver, lead and copper for over four
centuries but in recent years its importance to Potosi has depended
less on the value of its ore and more upon the thousands of tourists
it brings to the town. The combination of the mine and the rich
colonial architecture of Potosi have made the town one of the "must
sees" for visitors to Bolivia. And the tourists have provided an
ideal market for the textile art of the region. <p>

Until recently, textile art had been struggling to survive.
Generations of women in Calcha, south of Potosi, for example, had
learned the skills of weaving but as Bolivia developed in the 1970s
many began to feel that it was a symbol of the past. In schools,
children were fined if they arrived in traditional dress, and in
major cities you could be shouted at in the streets for wearing
traditional costume. A whole generation of women grew up believing
that weaving was backward, and there was a real danger that the
artistry would die out.<p>

From that low base, ACTIONAID and a number of independent women's
groups have worked to rescue the traditional skills - and their
potential to create income for poor households in the region. Now
there are six groups, each with around 12 women. Typically, they
meet each week to produce yarn and to dye the wool, while doing the
actual weaving at home. It's painstaking, highly-skilled work and
the results are beautiful - finely-woven cloth with ancient designs
representing objects as diverse as lakes and dogs, wells and bird's
nests. Each has a meaning. "We learned the different designs from
our mothers," explains Rita Mora of the Puca Pampa textile group.
"And though my daughter is a bit young to join a group, now she is
learning them in school."<p>

<b><font size=2 face=ariel, helvetica>

The textile project was established in 1993 by CIAC, a local
organisation which is supported by ACTIONAID and Ayuda en Accion,
our Spanish affiliate. It was the brainchild of Elisabeth Guisler, a
German anthropologist. Elisabeth came to Calcha in 1989 to study the
region's culture and quickly became determined not to study its
decline but to help it survive. "Some of the designs would
definitely have died out," she says. "Many weren't being produced.
Now they have them back, and the women are looking at the designs
that their grandmothers are wearing to see how to produce them."

Earlier this year, you would have found Elisabeth in Potosi's
ancient Treasury building, helping out at an exhibition and sale of
the designs. During the two-week long exhibition, the weavers were
able to display their work to Potosi's tourists, while displays told
the story of the art and the way in which the women work. The
exhibition's popularity is borne out by the enthusiastic comments in
the visitors book (see box). <p>

However, the project has done far more than simply preserve a
traditional way of life. A source of income, self-esteem, and an
opportunity to meet as a group - all of these have been vital
ingredients in the project's success. Income has been a crucial
factor. Many men in the Calcha region are forced to migrate for
months of the year to earn money for their families. Until the
project began to organise the sale of the textiles, women had little
or no income during these months to tide themselves over until
harvest. "Many husbands migrate and send some money, but not
enough," explains Marta de Auchachi, who is president of the women's
groups. "Weaving gives us a source of income so that we can look
after ourselves and our children."<p> 


Though the intricacy of the cloth means each woman can weave only
perhaps 12cm of cloth in a day, it's worth it: a metre-long piece of
cloth can sell for up to £30. This financial incentive adds a new
dimension to the importance of weaving as a source of self-esteem
for women in the region. In Calcha, there is a saying that a good
woman is a good weaver (and vice versa). In a region where decisions
tend to be taken - both inside and outside the home - by men,
textile art was one thing that women could claim as their own. But
as the art began to die out, so too did that prestige. Now it is
returning - with interest. Lucia Mora de Gira is from Calcha, and
now works with the project. She explains: "Being part of the textile
project gives the women an income and they can make a financial
contribution to the family economy. That in turn is changing the way
that men think of them - though there is still a long way to go."
<p>
The change is noticeable in villages such as Yuraj Cancha, high in
the Andes. Here, the community and CIAC have just finished building
a centre for the women to meet. "It was the community as a whole
that wanted a space for the women to meet," says Jose Colque
Miranda, one of the village's leaders (and a man). "Calcha culture
was being lost, and selling the textiles has produced another source
of income for us and our children."<p>

<b>From textiles to politics</b><p>

Centres like the one in Yuraj Cancha are taking the project onto a
new level. Before, weaving was a solitary occupation, carried out
only in the woman's home. Now, women meet together to produce yarn
or to dye the wool. These meetings offer a chance to discuss the way
the weaving is going, but also more general issues. And from these
informal meetings has come a demand for information on family
planning, on health issues - even politics: "The women think it is
important as Bolivians to vote, but they realise that they don't
know enough about the political system to make an informed
decision," says Lucia Mora de Gira. <p>

And the project is also generating a demand among the women for new
skills. Through administrating their groups, the women are finding a
real need for training in literacy and numeracy. Some have basic
skills - enough, for example, to keep track of how much wool they
have used. But increasingly the women want more advanced skills, and
the project is expanding to provide courses for them. "The aim is to
make the project sustainable," says Lucia. "If CIAC leaves, we want
a project that the women can run themselves."<p>

ACTIONAID's work in Calcha is more broad-based than simply
supporting the textile project. For example, in Yuraj Cancha, where
a women's centre has recently been built (see main text), one of the
key problems is lack of water - a problem that the whole region
shares. <p>

Because communities in Yuraj Cancha survive by growing maize,
peaches and apples, every drop of water is vital. ACTIONAID has
helped to provide better, concrete irrigation canals. "Before, the
only irrigation was soil channels that we dug out," says community
leader Jose Colque Miranda. "They wasted a lot of water because it
seeped away. The new concrete canals don't leak and so they improve
production."<p>

Work here also includes training to help improve fruit yields (a
well pruned peach tree will produce twice as many peaches in half
the space), to diversify production into, for example, beekeeping
and vegetables, and to halt the land loss caused by the region's
worsening erosion. <p>

As well as long-term development projects, unforeseen incidents can
of course demand attention. Last year Jose's son Grover (who is
pictured playing football on the front cover) fell off a high wall
and broke his leg. With no medical help in the area, Jose carried
him on a stretcher to Calcha, some five hours away, where CIAC,
ACTIONAID's partner in the region, helped him find a doctor and pay
for treatment.<p>

<h2>Where there's a will</h2>


<b>Legacies left by supporters are a valuable source of project
funding.</b><p>

<font face=ariel, helvetica>
The residents of Giam village (pictured) in Son La Province,
Vietnam, have learned how they can use an "A-frame" to mark out
lines for planting hedgerows. <p>

Part of an expanding programme, A-frames help farmers of rice, maize
and other crops to cultivate hedgerows along the contours of this
mountainous area, thereby staving off the erosion and deforestation
which threaten their livelihoods. <p>

Having seen for themselves how effective hedgerows can be in
preventing erosion, over 2,000 farmers have now taken up hedgerow
cultivation in eight communities in Son La. As word spreads, more
farmers in neighbouring areas are trying out hedgerows for
themselves.<p>

The farming programme in Vietnam has benefited greatly from the
largest legacy ever left to ACTIONAID - £189,000 from a supporter in
Norfolk, who requested that the money should be spent in the Far
East. The donation is also being used to fund healthcare, water, and
savings and credit schemes which allow individuals to start
enterprises by taking out small loans. Son La savings and credit
scheme now has almost 2,000 members, including some of the most
isolated people in the province. <p>

Another generous donor with a particular interest in education has
left £70,000 for education work in Merti, north-east Kenya. The
money will provide teaching and learning materials, and will help
train 40 teachers and 120 members of school committees in languages,
mathematics and management skills. <p>

But legacies don't have to be huge to make a difference. Even the
smallest sums bequeathed by ACTIONAID supporters reinforce our work
in parts of the world where supporters have a special interest. Or
they bolster our general funds which are used for emergencies such
as conflict or drought, for influencing policies that affect
poverty, and for research, education projects and other
activities.<p> 

So vital is the funding raised from legacies that ACTIONAID has
teamed up with five other development agencies to operate Will Aid,
through which supporters can have their wills drawn up free of
charge. Pioneered by a Scottish solicitor in 1988 Will Aid has so
far raised almost £2.5m for the six charities, while providing
clients with a cheap and efficient way of making a will to benefit
their loved ones and their chosen causes.<p>
 
The scheme, which runs during November every other year, is not just
for people who wish to donate their whole estate to ACTIONAID or
another Will Aid charity. Many clients leave only a small gift in
their wills, and some none at all. In place of the normal
solicitors' fee, Will Aid suggests that you make a donation of £40
to be passed on to the Will Aid charities. The solicitors involved
in Will Aid give their services for free. <p>

If you are one of the millions of people who intend to make a will
but never quite get around to it, bear in mind that should you die
intestate, a valued friend, relative or organisation might not
receive the special gift you wanted to leave them. Instead your life
savings may automatically be channelled to relatives specified by
the state.<p>

Every year in England and Wales alone around £2bn is left by
individuals who die without making a will. Imagine what a difference
that money could make to their bereaved families and friends - and
to desperately poor communities around the world.

ACTIONAID is one of the few charities working with them.</font><p><hr><p>Slowly, Bangladesh is changing shape. The country, which sits in the shadow of the Himalayas where the rivers Meghna, Ganges and Brahmaputra meet, is gaining new land as silt from the mountains to the north is deposited by the rivers to form new islands - chars - on which first plants and then people and animals can live. <p>For a country with the highest population density in the world, new land should be good news, giving landless people somewhere to live. But there are drawbacks. Because settlement of the chars is so new, there is no local government, and basic facilities - water, schools, proper roads - are often makeshift or non-existent. Ownership of the land is often disputed, too, as char inhabitants are forced off their land by unscrupulous landlords or made to pay rent. <p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=280 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=260 bgcolor=CCFFFF><TR><TD><img src="03.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=250 height=165> </TD></TR><TR><TD> <p><font size=small face=helvetica>Dhal Char is an isolated island of the southern tip of Bangladesh. Families survive through fishing and growing crops, but always there is the threat of cyclones, which can strike the island with little warning.<br> (Liba Taylor</font> &copy;).</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>Then there are the natural hazards. Many of the chars are out in the Bay of Bengal, off the coast of Bangladesh, where they are especially vulnerable to the cyclones which lash the country each year. And the land itself remains unstable. If a river changes direction slightly, the current may erode a part of the char, and land containing someone's home and crops may be carried away - back into the river from which it first came.<p>For all these reasons, the people living on chars are often the most vulnerable among Bangladesh's poor - which is why ACTIONAID is committed to working with them. <p>Char Monnia is a typical example. In 1972 it emerged from the turbulence of the Jamuna river, which flows through the middle of Bangladesh. Successive floods have left silt on the char, making it increasingly fertile for crops. Today, 12,000 people live here, scraping a living by growing groundnuts, rice, sugar cane and lentils. <p>ACTIONAID is the only charity working on Char Monnia, struggling to help the growing population cope with life on this flat block of land lacking a natural supply of fresh water, and without any infrastructure such as schools, clinics or roads.<p>ACTIONAID began working here in 1994, and some of its work is immediately obvious to a visitor. Water was an immediate priority, and in its first year 57 tube wells were sunk nearly 60 metres into the earth, at a cost of around 6,000 taka (about £95) each. More are planned - and needed: up to half of the people on the char still drink river water. Education is another priority, and there are now seven non-formal education centres on the char. ACTIONAID helped to build them and provides the teachers, but each community has a stake in the project too - it pays a small rent for the use of the building. <p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=180 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=160 bgcolor=CCFFFF><TR><TD><img src="04.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=150 height=234> </TD></TR><TR><TD> <p> <font size=small face=helvetica>Jaigun Begum lives on Char Monnia, a newly-formed char which is home to 12,000 people. Jaigun bought a boat with an ACTIONAID loan and uses it to travel to the uninhabited bank of the river to collect grass for her cow. <br>(Nurjahan Chaklader </font> &copy;).</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>Much of ACTIONAID's other work on Char Monnia - as in the rest of Bangladesh - is less visible. It takes place through shomitis - small social groups, usually composed of women. Through shomitis, loans are distributed, which members of the shomiti can use to meet immediate needs or to build income for the future. ACTIONAID provides the initial loan fund, though the members themselves distribute it and collect the repayments. But members are also required to save small amounts each week, and this eventually provides the money to be loaned out. <p>Alisa Khartun moved to Char Monnia 12 years ago, and has been a member of an ACTIONAID shomiti for one year. She had been struggling to make ends meet since her husband died of cholera in 1992 and had fallen into debt. With a T1000 (£16) loan from the shomiti last year, she has been able to pay off the money she owed to moneylenders (and was repaying at far higher interest rates) and buy hens and chickens. Now, she sells the eggs. &quot;I struggled a lot when my husband died,&quot; she says. &quot;He used to work in the field and his income helped us raise our children (Alisa has five, aged between four and 16). Life is still difficult but the loan has been a big help.&quot;<p>Alisa's home is fairly secure, well inland on the char, and erosion should not affect her. However, floods remain a constant hazard - though Alisa is long used to them. Asked how she copes when water rises ten feet, swamping her home, she replies matter-of-factly: &quot;We go on the roof.&quot;<p>Her near-neighbour on Char Monnia is also a member of an ACTIONAID shomiti. Jaigun Begum owns a cow, and needs regular supplies of grass to feed it. But grass is in short supply on Char Monnia, with every available piece of land in use to grow food. Her solution? She borrowed money from the shomiti to buy a small boat, which she uses to go to the other, uninhabited, side of the river to collect the grass.<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=180 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=160 bgcolor=CCFFFF><TR><TD><img src="05.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=150 height=258> </TD></TR><TR><TD> <p> <font size=small face=helvetica>This plaque on Dhal Char pays tribute to the ACTIONAID supporters who contributed £670,000 following the terrible cyclone of 1991. The money funded new roads, bridges and cyclone shelters, which saved hundreds of lives when another cyclone struck the island in May 1995.<br>(Marc Boettcher</font> &copy;)</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>Simple arrangements such as this - combined with the provision of water, education and health services - can transform people's lives, and the great majority of ACTIONAID's work throughout Bangladesh takes place through these small but crucial transactions.    Sometimes, though, work needs to take place on a larger scale to help people cope with out-of-the-ordinary events.<p>On Dhal Char, many kilometres off the southern tip of mainland Bangladesh, there is written testimony to this type of work - and oral testimony from people who might well not be alive today were it not for that work.<p>In 1991, Dhal Char found itself in the eye of the worst cyclone to hit Bangladesh for over 20 years. Throughout the country over 100,000 people died, and on Dhal Char the death toll was 103. In the wake of the disaster, ACTIONAID supporters contributed £670,000 to an Emergency Cyclone Programme which provided immediate relief and also funded longer-term work to prevent the disaster from happening again. Two new cyclone shelters were built, along with the roads and bridges which provide a direct route to them, and today the char is dotted with plaques recording the inhabitants' gratitude. <p>On 15 May last year those precautions were put to the test when another cyclone struck the island. Nine-year-old Mohammed Ibrahim takes up the story: &quot;It had been raining heavily for about three or four days. On the last day, the water started to come into the house. The tide rose up and my brother and I drove the cattle to the ground shelter, and then came to the cyclone shelter to take refuge.&quot;It was the evening, and all the rooms were crowded with people. There was hardly any room to spare. I was trembling with fear.<p>&quot;We stayed in the shelter all night, while the floods swept away the land and some of the roads. In the morning we left. My house was partly destroyed, and that of my neighbour was totally destroyed, but we were safe.&quot;<p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=230 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=210 bgcolor=CCFFFF><TR><TD><img src="06.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=200 height=149> </TD></TR><TR><TD> <p> <font size=small face=helvetica>These children may owe their lives to the cyclone shelters which ACTIONAID supporters funded. (Left to right) Koreem Poraji, Elias Mather, Shamchun Nahar, Balal Maji and Nahar Begum used the shelters during the cyclone of May 1995. Balal was blown from the first floor of the shelter by the heavy winds - but the knee-deep water and soft ground saved him from injury.<br>(Liba Taylor</font> &copy;).</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>No one died in the 1995 cyclone, though a few had close escapes.        Six-year-old Belal Maji was taken to another ACTIONAID-built shelter by his mother and father. When they weren't looking, he climbed up on to the top of a wall and the wind blew him off. He fell 10 metres, but a combination of mud and knee-deep water saved him from injury. <p>Without the new cyclone shelters, and the roads to them, the outcome might have been very different. The people of Dhal Char, like those of Char Monnia, know that their existence is a precarious one, subject to the vagaries of river, wind, sea and rain, and to the everyday difficulties of earning money, getting an education and keeping healthy. <p>It's a struggle in which ACTIONAID, and its supporters, is proud to play a small but vital role. <br clear=all><hr><p>Find out more about ACTIONAID's work in <b><a href="../../info/bangladesh.html">Bangladesh</a></b><p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

It is also less of a taboo subject than it has become in Western society (and in some places, funerals are popular venues for young people to meet!). Different religious beliefs give rise to various customs, yet there are many similarities in the ceremonies accompanying a person's departure from this world. Once a death has occurred, a period of mourning begins. Among the Chewa people of rural Malawi, close relations of the deceased wear a strip of cloth, or kam'bambe, around their head to denote their loss. Funerals then take place to celebrate the life of the deceased, furnish them with a good 'sending off', and to establish the social status of the dead person and surviving family members. <p>In Sapeliga in Ghana, people are expected to organise hospitality for the whole village, going on for more than 10 days. Immediate family and in-laws have to provide accommodation, food and       entertainment for hundreds of people. The Sherpas of the Sindhupalchowk area of Nepal also spend a lot of money on the ghewa, a ceremony to free the soul of a dead person from its body. The ghewa lasts for three days and in the weeks prior to it, a lama (Buddhist priest) performs various rituals. A poor family may take up to a year to save enough money to conduct the ghewa.<p>In contrast, in Muslim tradition, when a family member has died the mourners do not cook for themselves for 40 days. Instead, relatives and neighbours bring food. When the 40 days of mourning are over, the family invite all their relatives and friends to a meal, when they might cook the dead person's favourite food as an act of remembrance.<h3>New life </h3>Hindu ceremonies are founded on the belief that the soul has departed from the dead person, to be born again into a new life (reincarnation), and that the body needs to be cast off by burning it. The body of a dead person is wrapped in a cloth and put on a pile of wood. The job of lighting the cremation fire goes to a Hindu's eldest son, while ghee (clarified butter) is thrown on to the fire to help it burn. After three days, the ashes are gathered up, wrapped in a cloth and, if possible, thrown into the river Ganges, the Hindus' holy river. <p><TABLE BORDER=0 width=180 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 width=160 bgcolor=FFCC99><TR><TD><img src="07.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=6 width=150 height=258> </TD></TR><TR><TD> <p><font size=small face=helvetica>In Galaka, Ghana, offerings of food, herbs and money are built into a pyramid shape which is covered in cloth and photographs of the deceased person.<p>(Jerry Flynn</font> &copy;)</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>Dances and processions are often important features of the funeral ceremony. In Nepal the Sherpas place the dead body in a large copper cauldron, in a sitting position, to take it for cremation. The body is wrapped in a piece of white cloth over 10 metres long which is held by the mourners as they walk to the funeral pyre. A lama leads the procession, and a wind instrument called the lapha is played. For the Chewa people in Malawi, dancers known as zilombi, or beasts, perform the gulewamkulu (or big dance) both before and after the burial to symbolise the deceased's entry into the spirit world. During the burial it is important for any young children of the deceased to throw a piece of charcoal into the grave or coffin, or have the coffin carried over their heads, so that the spirit of the dead does not come back to haunt them. <p>Even after the immediate period of mourning is complete, rituals continue. The ghewa of the Nepalese Sherpas takes place at least five weeks after the body has been cremated. An effigy of the deceased is made using clothes put aside from the cremation and taken to a specially built shed in the courtyard, where it is placed in a nanglo, a round tray made of bamboo. Money and food are placed on the nanglo, and lamas recite religious hymns. Children and close relatives then take turns to make vows to the effigy while holding a scroll with sacred inscriptions.<p>In the Andean villages of Peru, the family of a departed member goes through the ritual laying out of the dead person's clothes, one year later. For 12 months, the soul is believed to have lingered around the home. To help it along to the next world, family and friends gather for an all-night vigil. Candles are lit, mourners chew coca leaves and drink a traditional alcoholic beverage called araquito. By the time dawn breaks, the living and the dead have parted company. 	<br clear=left><p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><b><li type=square><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

What do we mean by 'aid'?</b><br>Aid is money given by governments and people in relatively wealthy countries to governments or people in poorer countries. The givers tend to be in the developed world; the recipients, developing countries and those in Eastern Europe/former Soviet Union. <p><b>2. Why do we give aid?</b><br>Most people believe that aid is given chiefly for altruistic reasons - to improve the conditions of people living in poverty. This is certainly true of money given by individual members of the public, and it is also partly true of money given by governments, though not exclusively. Aid from one government to another is also used for purposes such as creating and winning markets for donor government exports, for political leverage and to improve diplomatic relations.<p><b>3. How much do we spend on it?</b><br>Worldwide, in 1993 £36.5 billion was spent in development aid - almost half given by countries in the European Union. Of this total Britain gave £1.9 billion - just under 0.31 per cent of the country's national wealth (GNP). By comparison, Britain spent over £21 billion on defence and over £70 billion on social security. In the same year non-governmental organisations (NGOs) gave over £4 billion - money mostly raised through charitable donations. British NGOs - for example, ACTIONAID and Oxfam - spent £302 million on aid to poor countries.<p><b>4. Do we spend all of it directly?</b><br>No. Of the UK aid budget, 55 per cent is given in grant form directly from the British government. This is known as bilateral aid. The remaining 45 per cent is multilateral aid, channelled through groups of countries such as the European Union (EU) or United Nations (UN). Following an agreement signed at the Edinburgh Summit in 1992, the amount of aid given through the EU is set to rise. By 1998 it is likely that two-thirds of the overall UK aid budget will be spent through multilateral organisations. <img src="09.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=3 width=200 height=207 border=1><p><b>5. Who spends Britain's aid?</b><br>The Overseas Development Administration (ODA), headed by Baroness Lynda Chalker (right), is the UK government department which allocates aid. <p><font size=small face=helvetica, arial>Photo: Marc Boettcher</font> &copy;.<p><b>6. Which countries get most of our bilateral aid ...? </b><br>Last year ODA grants were received by more than 160 countries, with the biggest allocations to: India, Bangladesh, former Yugoslavia, Pakistan, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Indonesia, Mozambique and China. Together they accounted for almost £500 million - or almost half the bilateral aid budget. <p><b>7. ...and what is it spent on?</b><br>UK official aid is spent on projects such as clean water, roads and bridges and the provision of electricity; finance for essential materials and equipment such as vehicles, fertiliser and tools; technical assistance such as training and research; and emergency aid.<p><b>8. How much reaches the poorest people?</b><br>According to UN figures, less than 10 per cent of British government bilateral aid is spent on meeting the basic needs of poor people (such as primary health care, clean water and basic education). The remaining 90 per cent is spent on activities concerned less directly with poverty reduction.<p><b>9. Does Britain benefit economically?</b><br>Around one third of the Government's aid programme is 'tied' to the purchase of goods and services from the UK. However, recent studies have shown that this practice inflates the prices of these goods and services by around 15 per cent. Additionally, tied aid stifles the growth of industry in the Third World, creates dependence on parts and maintenance from donor countries, and is less likely than aid which is not tied to be poverty-focused.<p><b>10. Do we spend more or less now than in the past?</b><br>Over the past 25 years, the UK aid budget has declined from 0.51 per cent of GNP in 1979 to 0.31 per cent in 1993. To a large extent this mirrors the decline in aid from rich countries. 	Despite an agreement more than 20 years ago by most donor countries to increase aid levels to 0.7 per cent of GNP (an amount, set by the UN, that was believed would substantially reduce poverty), few give more than half this. And apart from Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, which consistently meet or exceed 0.7 per cent, the general trend is for governments to move away from the target rather than towards it. <p><b>11. What is ACTIONAID's view of the situation...?</b><br>ACTIONAID is concerned at declining aid levels, at the small percentage that is targeted towards such fundamental areas as primary healthcare, clean water and basic education, and at what this demonstrates about the commitment of rich countries to reduce poverty. It is not alone. In October 1994, ACTIONAID published the results of a parliamentary poll showing that 82 per cent of MPs believe more money should be spent on these areas. In the same poll, 70 per cent said they would like to see the aid budget doubled. <p><b>12. ...and what is it doing about it?</b><br>ACTIONAID is urging the Government to make the following changes to its aid spending: <ul><li>To protect the aid budget from cuts.<li>To increase the proportion of bilateral aid spent on basic needs to 20 per cent of the total budget. (This would provide substantial extra funds to support people in extreme poverty.)<li>As a first step, to increase the total aid budget to at least equal the average of our European Partners - currently around 0.49 per cent. The second stage would be to meet the 0.7 per cent target.<li>To reduce the amount of tied aid from its current levels.</ul>	Above all, ACTIONAID believes that aid money should be spent, first and foremost, in reducing poverty and helping poor communities improve their quality of life. <p>ACTIONAID is joining forces with other development agencies to protect the UK's aid budget from potential cuts this autumn. If you would like to help, or require further information, please contact <b>ACTIONAID on 0171 281 4101.</b><p><hr><h3>The Pergau Dam affair </h3><p>The Aid and Trade Provision (ATP) is a part of the Government's aid programme which is intended to advance UK commercial interests abroad and promote development. It accounts for between five and ten per cent of the overall aid programme. <p>In 1991 the Government gave the approval to fund the construction of a hydro-electric dam in Malaysia through the ATP programme. Over time, however, it became clear that not only would the dam cost British taxpayers £234 million - more than the yearly sum spent on basic needs - it would cost the Malaysian government £100 million more in electricity costs than some cheaper alternatives. 	The project led the World Development Movement - a UK pressure group - to seek legal action. After a court case in November 1994, the Government was found guilty of abusing the 1980 Overseas Development and Cooperation Act. Funding the Pergau Dam project was ruled unlawful because it was neither economically sound nor a contribution to reducing poverty.	As a result the Government agreed to find future resources for Pergau from the Treasury rather than the aid budget. However, the government's proposed cuts to the UK bilateral aid budget are roughly equal to the amount being paid by the Treasury for Pergau, raising concern that the ODA is being 'punished' for the affair.<p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

With help from COMUS, a local organisation, and from ACTIONAID, the people from the communities around Taburete Hill have been able to rehabilitate abandoned lands using organic farming techniques, and earn a living growing coffee.<p>The story goes back to the 1980s, when the campesinos (peasant farmers) took over plantations abandoned by the large landowners during the war, and set about working them for themselves. Despite the physical danger the armed conflict brought for them, the campesinos at first sowed basic crops such as maize and beans for their daily survival.<p>When the conflict came to an end in early 1992, the campesinos organised themselves into co-operatives, with the help of COMUS, so that they could make their claims to legal land titles, provided for under the UN-brokered peace accords. These stipulated that people who had been farming land would be allowed to continue doing so and would be helped to find a satisfactory legal solution to definitive land ownership. In the new climate of peace, the campesinos also sought COMUS's help in the form of credit and technical advice and support. They wanted to start planting coffee once again, to supplement their subsistence crops of beans and maize. The war was finished, and as campesino  Jose Eduardo Sigaran says: <i>&quot;Coffee planting is a long tradition. From the moment we are born we come to this world with the tradition of coffee, a tradition which comes from our dead grandparents. It is an intrinsic part of us.&quot;*</i><p>Here, they stumbled upon one of the most unexpected and unforeseen benefits of the war. For 12 years, most of the land around Taburete Hill had been free of chemicals. Once the properties had been abandoned, the campesinos had been too poor to afford the chemical fertilisers, weed killers, and chemical pesticides. The land could now be exploited in a more environmentally friendly way - to grow organic coffee, which was both cheaper to produce and fetched a better price in the marketplace.Enrique Zelaya, COMUS's organic farming advisor, says: <i>&quot;We can achieve a better standard of living, without any cost to the community's natural resources.&quot;</i><p>The only blot on the landscape is that one of the cooperatives in the area has had difficulty obtaining the legal titles giving them the de facto right to the land they have worked so hard over the last 10 years. Though COMUS has appointed a legal adviser for the campesinos, as yet the problem remains unresolved. In the meantime, those with the closest historical and ancestral ties to the land, the campesinos of Taburete, continue looking after their chief livelihood resource with organic farming methods.  <p><i>*Shortly after recording this interview, Jose Eduardo Sigaran and his nephew, an ACTIONAID sponsored child, were tragically killed in a landslide caused by heavy rains. ACTIONAID expresses its sympathy, and is helping the families affected by the landslide to rebuild their homes. </i><p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b></font><br clear=all><p></body></html>

Often it will take place earlier than is normal in the West - half the women in Africa, 40 per cent in Asia and 30 per cent in Latin America will be married by the age of 18. In some societies, social factors - often economic ones - will give rise to polygamy. <p>These different types of marriage are reflected in the radically different customs and traditions that surround wedding ceremonies. However, their essential function remains the same, and many ceremonies contain similar rituals and customs.<p>Rituals involving symbolic items - clothes, foods and other objects - are familiar features of weddings worldwide. <p>In India, Hindu ceremonies vary greatly but they share one common symbol: fire - whether in the form of diyas (lighted lamps) or a small fire behind which the couple sit. In virtually all Hindu ceremonies, the couple walk at a significant moment clockwise around the fire or diyas seven times, to symbolise seven sacred pledges.<p>In Sella Limba, Sierra Leone, the marriage ceremony involves kola nuts, a packet of needles, thread, a mat and some money, which are put inside a calabash (the shell of a gourd) and wrapped in a thiga-ba-huheh (a piece of white cloth). They signify long life and prosperity (the gourd), economy during hard times (the needles, thread and mat), betrothal value (the money) and purity (the cloth). <p>Legal customs are also common in marriage ceremonies. Marriage - along with death - is the time of life when property is most likely to change hands. Under the dowry system, for example, women must take a substantial part of the family's wealth with them into a marriage. <p><b>Wedding bond</b><p>Once inside the marriage, this property is most likely to be controlled by the husband - though not always. Among the Amharas of central Ethiopia, the couple sign a wedding bond which asserts the right of each partner to one half of all property acquired during the time of the marriage (though not to that acquired before). This right is called Habtish be Habete ('Your chance is mine'). <p>Social customs also abound. Different societies have very different customs concerning who may marry whom, what type of courtship should be carried out and how the marriage ceremony should be conducted. <p>In highland Bolivia, indigenous Aymara traditions flourish despite conversion to Christianity many centuries ago. Courtship often involves the man stealing the possessions of the woman and waiting for her to reclaim them. <p>Among the Amharas, the wedding customs also last for a week or so. Here, the couple live with the groom's parents after the ceremony and, one week later, are invited by the bride's parents for dinner, along with friends and members of the family circle. Only after about two months do the couple leave the groom's parents' home and live by themselves. <p>Though the customs may vary in many of the communities with which ACTIONAID works, the essential function of marriage is the same: to ensure an individual's livelihood and to provide an environment in which to produce heirs. Frequently, the marriage is arranged by the parents of the bride and groom, often with the help of community elders. Though love is often expected to develop after the marriage, it is not a prerequisite for it to happen in the first place.<p>  The views of the couple may be taken into account, however. Among the Aymara of Bolivia, for example, both sets of parents, and both fianc&eacute;s, have the option of cancelling during the cohabitation period. Here, as in most Western societies, young people increasingly want more freedom in their choice. However, though this trend is increasing, the 'traditional' family-arranged marriage looks set to remain the norm in most societies well into the 21st century. <p>Research by: Milkias Lissanu, ACTIONAID Ethiopia; Adam Burke, ACTIONAID Bolivia; Isatu M Koroma, ACTIONAID Sierra Leone; Ashish Sen, ACTIONAID India. <p><hr><p><a href="../../home.html"><img src="../../pix/home.gif" width=46height=41 hspace=10vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent"><imgsrc="../../pix/globe1.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a> <a href="../index.html"><img src="../../pix/back.gif" width=46height=41hspace=10 vspace=2 border=0 align=right></a><font size=1 face=helvetica, arial><li type=square><b><a href="../../home.html">Home Page</a></b> <li type=square><b><ahref="../../fight/index.html" target="_parent">JoinACTIONAID</a></b> <li type=square><b><a href="../index.html">Common Cause</a></b<br clear=all><p></body></html>
