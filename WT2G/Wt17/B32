the requirements of and the permits for construction and operation
(temporary or otherwise) into one permit. He may likewise combine
the requirements of and applications for construction and operating
permits into one application.
<li><a name=08>Permit Requirements.</a>
<ol type=a>
<li>Each application for a permit to construct a new stationary
source or modify an existing stationary source shall be subjected
to a preconstruction or premodification review by the Director.
The Director shall determine prior to issuing any permit that
the proposed construction or modification will not cause or contribute
to a failure to attain (as expeditiously as practicable) or maintain
any ambient air quality standard, a significant deterioration
of air quality, or a violation of any applicable emission limitation
or standard of performance or other requirement under the Act
or this Chapter (391-3-1). Each person applying to the Director
for a permit to construct a new stationary source or modify an
existing stationary source shall provide information required
by the Director to make such determination.
<li>In addition to any other requirement under the Act, or this
Chapter (391-3-1), no permit to construct a new stationary source
or modify an existing stationary source shall be issued unless
such proposed source meets all the requirements for review and
for obtaining a permit prescribed in Title I, Part C of the Federal
Act, and Section 391-3-1.02(7) of these Rules.
<li>In addition to any other requirement under the Act or this
Chapter (391-3-1), no permit to construct a new or modified major
stationary source [to be located in any area of the State determined
and designate by the U .S. EPA Administrator or the Director as
not attaining a National Ambient Air Quality Standard or in areas
contributing to the ambient air levels of such pollutants in such
areas of nonattainment] shall be issued unless:
<ol type=1>
<li>The Director determines that by the time the source is to commence
operation, sufficient offsetting emissions reductions have been
obtained, such that total allowable emissions from existing sources
in the region, from new or modified sources which are not major
emitting facilities, and from the proposed source, will be sufficiently
less than total emissions from existing sources allowed prior
to the application for such permit to construct or modify, so
as to represent (when considered together with other air pollution
control measures legally enforced in such area or region) reasonable
further progress (as defined in Section 171 of the Federal Act);
and
<li>The proposed source is required to comply with the lowest achievable
emission rate; and
<li>The owner or operator of the proposed new or modified source
has demonstrated that all major stationary sources owned or operated
by such person (or by an entity controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with such person) in this State, are subject
to emission limitations and are in compliance, or on a schedule
for compliance, with all applicable emission limitations and standards
under the Act; and
<li>An analysis (by the person proposing such construction or modification)
of alternative sites, sizes, production processes and environmental
control techniques for such proposed source demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Director that benefits of the proposed source
significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed
as a result of its proposed location construction or modification;
and
<li>The State's Implementation Plan (approved by the Administrator
pursuant to the Federal Act) is being carried out in the nonattainment
area in which the proposed source is to be constructed or modified
in accordance with the requirements of Title I, Part D of the
Federal Act.
<li>The offset baseline for determining credits for emission reductions
at a source is the applicable emission limits in this Chapter
or the actual emissions at the time the application to construct
is filed, whichever is less. Creditable reductions must occur
within two years prior to the filing of the permit application
and the time the newly permitted source emissions commence.
<li>Emission reductions achieved by shutting down an existing source
or permanently curtailing production or operating hours below
baseline levels may be credited, provided that the work force
to be affected has been notified of the proposed shutdown or curtailment.
Source shutdowns and curtailments in production or operating hours
occurring prior to the date of the new source application may
be used for offset credits if the applicant can establish that
the shutdown or curtailment of production occurred less than one
year prior to the date of permit application and the proposed
new source is a replacement for the shutdown in whole or in part.
<li>No emission offset credit may be allowed for replacing one
VOC compound with another of less reactivity.
<li>Procedures relating to the permissible location of offsetting
emissions shall be followed which are at least as stringent as
those contained in 40 CFR, Part 52, Appendix S, Section IV.D.
<li>Offset credit for an emission reduction can be claimed to
the extent that the Director has not relied on it in issuing any
other permit or has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment
of reasonable further progress.
<P>
<li>The Director may elect not to consider fugitive emissions,
to the extent they are quantifiable, in calculating the potential
to emit from a stationary source or modification in determining
whether the source is major and the source does not belong to
any of the following categories:

</ol>
<li>Offsets.
<ol type=i>
<li>The owner or operator of a new or modified major stationary
source may comply with any offset requirement in effect under
this subsection for increased emissions of any air pollutant only
by obtaining emission reductions of such air pollutants from the
same source or other sources in the same nonattainment area, except
that the Director may allow the owner or operator of a source
to obtain such emission reductions in another nonattainment area
if:
<ol type=I>
<li>The other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification
than the area in which the source is located; and
<li>Emissions from such other area contribute to a violation
of the national ambient air quality standard in the nonattainment
area in which the source is located.
<p>
Such emission reductions shall be, by the time a new or modified

assure that the total tonnage of increased emissions of the air
pollutant from the new or modified source shall be offset by an
equal or greater reduction, as applicable, in the actual emissions
of such air pollutant from the same or other sources in the area.
</ol>
<li>Emission reductions otherwise required by the Federal Act
shall not be creditable as emissions reductions for purposes of
any such offset requirement. Incidental emission reductions which
are not otherwise required by the Federal Act shall be creditable
as emission reductions for such purposes if such emission reductions

<li>Additional Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas.
<ol type=i>
<li>In Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette
Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Paulding, and Rockdale counties,
the terms &quot;major source&quot; and &quot;major stationary
source&quot; include any stationary source or group of sources
located within a contiguous area and under common control that
emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 50 tons per year
of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides.
<li>Increased emissions of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen
oxides resulting from any physical change in, or change in the
method of operation of, a stationary source located in these counties
shall not be considered de minimis for purposes of determining
the applicability of the permit requirements established by this
subsection unless the net emissions increase of such air pollutant
from such source does not exceed 25 tons when aggregated over
any period of five consecutive calendar years which includes the
calendar year in which such increase occurred.
<li>In the case of any major stationary source located in these
counties which emits or has the potential to emit less than 100
tons of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides per year,
whenever any change (as described in Section 111(a)(4) of the
Federal Act) at that source results in any increase (other than
a de minimis increase) in emissions of volatile organic compounds
or nitrogen oxides from any discrete operation, unit, or other
pollutant emitting activity at the source, such increase shall
be considered a modification for purposes of this subsection,
unless the owner or operator of the source elects to offset the
increase by a greater reduction in emissions of volatile organic
compounds or nitrogen oxides from other operations, units, or
activities within the source at an internal offset ratio of at
least 1.3 to 1. If the owner or operator does not make such election,
such change shall be considered a modification for such purposes.
In applying this subsection in the case of any such modification,
the best available control technology (BACT), as defined by the
Federal Act, shall be substituted for the lowest achievable emission
rate (LAER).
<li>In the case of any major stationary source located in these
counties which emits or has the potential to emit more than 100
tons of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides per year,
whenever any change (as described in Section 111(a)(4) of the
Federal Act) at that source results in any increase (other than
a de minimis increase) in emissions of volatile organic compounds
or nitrogen oxides from any discrete operation, unit, or other
pollutant emitting activity at the source, such increase shall
be considered a modification for purposes of this subsection,
except that if the owner or operator of the source elects to offset
the increase by a greater reduction in emissions of volatile organic
compounds or nitrogen oxides from other operations, units, or
activities within the source at an internal offset ratio of at
least 1.3 to 1, the requirements of this subsection concerning
lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) shall not apply.
<li>For purposes of satisfying the emission offset requirements
of this subsection, the ratio of total emission reductions of
volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides to total increased
emissions of such air pollutant shall be at least 1.2 to 1 for
emission offsets external to the contiguous area under common
control at which the proposed new emission point is located.

<li>The Director shall, upon analysis of the ambient air in the
State, determine, and so designate, those areas of the State,
if any, which are not attaining any National Ambient Air Quality
Standards specified under the Federal Act, and any area contributing
to the ambient air level of any such pollutant (for which such
a standard has been established) in such areas of nonattainment.

<li>For the purposes of this section (10), 40 CFR Part 70.6(a)
as amended and 40 CFR 70.7(f) as amended are hereby incorporated
and adopted by reference.
<li>The permit may include terms and conditions allowing for
the trading of emissions changes in the permitted facility solely
for the purpose of complying with a federally enforceable emissions
cap that is established in the permit independent of otherwise
applicable requirements. The permit applicant shall include in
its application proposed replicable procedures and permit terms
that ensure that the emissions trades are quantifiable and enforceable.
The Director shall not be required to include in the emissions
trading provisions any emissions units for which emissions are
not quantifiable or for which there are no replicable procedures
to enforce the emissions trades.
<li>The permit may include additional elements not specified
in 40 CFR Part 70.6(a) as required by the Director.
</ol>
<li>The Director shall specifically designate as not being federally
enforceable under the federal Clean Air Act any terms and conditions
included in the permit that are not required under the federal
Clean Air Act or under any of its applicable requirements. If
the Director does not so designate a term or condition, it shall
be deemed federally enforceable.
<li>Compliance Requirements. For the purposes of this section (10),
40 CFR 70.6(c) is hereby incorporated and adopted by reference.
<li>General Permits: For the purpose of this section (10), 40 CFR
70.6(d) is hereby incorporated and adopted by reference.
<li>The Director may issue a single permit authorizing emissions
from similar operations by the same source owner or operator at
multiple temporary locations. The operation must be temporary
and involve at least one chance of location during the term of
the permit. No affected source shall be permitted as a temporary
source. Permits for temporary sources shall include:
<ol type=i>
<li>Conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable
requirements at all authorized locations;
<li>Requirements that the owner or operator notify the Director
at least 30 days in advance of each change in location; and
<li>Conditions that assure compliance with all of the provisions
of this section.
</ol>
<li>Permit Shield.
<ol type=i>
<li>Except as provided in this section (10), the Director may
expressly include in a part 70 permit a provision stating that
a source which is in compliance with the conditions of the permit
shall be deemed to be in compliance with any applicable requirements
as of the date of the permit issuance, provided that:
<ol type=I>
<li>Such applicable requirements are included and are specifically
identified in the permit; or
<li>The Director, in acting on the permit application or revision,
determines in writing that other requirements specifically identified
are not applicable to the source, and the permit includes the
determination or a concise summary thereof.
</ol>
<li>A part 70 permit that does not expressly state that a permit
shield exists shall be presumed not to provide such a shield.
<li>Nothing in this paragraph or in any part 70 permit shall
alter or affect the following:
<ol type=I>
<Li>The provisions of section 303 of the federal Clean Air Act
(emergency orders), including the authority of the Administrator
under that section or the provisions of O.C.G.A. Section 12-9-14.;
<li>The liability of an owner or operator of a source for any
violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of
permit issuance; or
<li>The applicable requirements of the acid rain program, consistent
with section 408(a) of the federal Clean Air Act; or
<li>The ability of EPA to obtain information from a source pursuant
to section 114 of the federal Clean Air Act or of the Director
to obtain information from a source pursuant to section <a href="391-3-02.htm #06>391-3-02(6)</a>.
</ol>
</ol>
<li>Emergency Provision: For the purpose of paragraph (10)(d)7.,
40 CFR Part 70.6(g) as amended is hereby incorporated and adopted
by reference.
<li>Alternative Requirements.
<ol type=i>
<li>In lieu of the requirements imposed pursuant to <a href="391-3-02.htm #02">391-3-02(2)</a>,
a facility owner may comply with alternative requirements, provided
the requirements are identified in the permit as alternate requirements
and are established pursuant to the part 70 permit issuance, renewal,
or significant permit revision process.
<P>
NOTE: Where EPA and States have developed different and often
overlapping applicable requirements governing the same emissions
units to serve the purposes of different air programs, emissions
units at a stationary source may be subject to several parallel
sets of requirements. In cases where compliance with a single
set of requirements effectively assures compliance with all requirements,
compliance with all elements of each of the overlapping requirements
may be unnecessary and could needlessly consume resources.
<li>Multiple emissions limits may be streamlined into one limit
if that limit is at least as stringent as the most stringent limit.
If no one requirement is unambiguously more stringent than the
others, the applicant may synthesize the conditions of all the
applicable requirements into a single new permit term that will
assure compliance with all requirements. The streamlined monitoring,
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements would generally be those
associated with the most stringent emissions limit, providing
they would assure compliance to the same extent as any subsumed
monitoring. Thus, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting to determine
compliance with subsumed limits would not be required where the
source implements the streamlined approach.
<li>Streamlining may be initiated by either the applicant or
the permitting authority. Streamlining can only be implemented
where the permit applicant consents to its use.
<li>For sources subject to an approved part 70 program, an alternative
requirement is approved for the source by EPA if it is incorporated
in an issued part 70 permit to which EPA has not objected. Where
the public comment period precedes the EPA review period, any
public comments concerning the alternative shall be transmitted
to EPA with the proposed permit. If the EPA and public comment
periods run concurrently, public comments shall be transmitted
to EPA no later than 5 working days after the end of the public
comment period. The Director's determination of approval is not
binding on EPA.
<li>Noncompliance with any provision established by this rule
constitutes a violation of this rule.
</ol>
</ol>
<li>Permit issuance, renewal, reopenings, and revisions.
<ol type=1>
<li>Action on application.
<ol type=i>
<li>A permit, permit modification, or renewal may be issued only
if all of the following conditions have been met:
<ol type=I>
<li>The Director has received a complete application, except that
a complete application need not be received before issuance of
a general permit under subsection (d);
<li>Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification
procedures under subparagraphs (e)5.(i) or (e)5.(ii), the Director
has complied with the requirements for public participation under
paragraph (e)8.;
<li>The Director has complied with the requirements for notifying
and responding to affected States under subsection (f);
<li>The conditions of the permit provide for compliance with
all applicable requirements; and
<li>The EPA Administrator has received a copy of the proposed
permit and any notices required under subsection (f) and has not
objected to issuance of the permit under subsection (f) within
the time period specified therein.
</ol>
<li>Except as provided under the initial transition plan or under
regulations promulgated under Title IV of the federal Clean Air
Act, the Director shall take final action on each permit application
(including request for permit modification or renewal) within
18 months after receiving a complete application.
<li>The Director shall provide a statement that sets forth the
legal and factual basis for the draft permit conditions (including
references to the applicable statutory or regulatory provisions).
The Director shall send this statement to EPA and to any other
person who requests it.
<li>The submittal of a complete application shall not affect
the requirement that any source have a preconstruction permit
under Section <a href="391-3-03.htm #08">391-3-03(8)</a>.
</ol>
<li>Requirement for a permit. Except as provided in paragraph (b)5.,
part (e)5.(i)(V) and part (e)5.(ii)(V), no part 70 source may
operate after the time that it is required to submit a timely
and complete application, except in compliance with a permit issued
under this section (10). If a part 70 source submits a timely
and complete application for permit issuance (including for renewal),
the source's failure to have a part 70 permit is not a violation
until the Director takes final action on the permit application.
This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness
determination, the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified
in writing by the Director any additional information identified
as being needed to process the application.
<li>Permit renewal and expiration.
<ol type=i>
<li>Permits being renewed are subject to the same procedural requirements,
including those for public participation, affected State and EPA
review, that apply to initial permit issuance.
<li>Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate
unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted.
<li>If a timely and complete application for permit renewal
is submitted, but the Director has failed to issue or deny the
renewal permit before the end of the term of the previous permit,
then the permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has
been issued or denied and any permit shield that may be granted
pursuant to paragraph (d)6. shall extend beyond the original permit
term until renewal.
</ol>
<li>Administrative permit amendments.
<ol type=i>
<li>Definitions: For the purpose of this paragraph, 40 CFR, Part
70.7(d)(1), as amended, is incorporated and adopted by reference.
<li>Administrative permit amendments for purposes of the acid
rain portion of the permit shall be governed by regulations promulgated
under Title IV of the federal Clean Air Act.
<li>An administrative permit amendment may be made by the Director
consistent with the following:
<ol type=I>
<li>The Director shall take no more than 60 days from receipt
of a request for an administrative permit amendment to take final
action on such request, and may incorporate such changes without
providing notice to the public or affected States provided that
it designates any such permit revisions as having been made pursuant
to this paragraph.
<li>The Director shall submit a copy of the revised permit to
the EPA Administrator.
<Li>The source may implement the changes addressed in the request
for an administrative amendment immediately upon submittal of
the request.
</ol>
<li>The Director may, upon taking final action granting a request
for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the
permit shield for administrative permit amendments made pursuant
to 40 CFR Part 70.7(d)(1)(v) which meet the requirements for significant
permit modifications.
</ol>
<li>Permit modification. A permit modification is any revision
to a part 70 permit that cannot be accomplished under paragraph
4. A permit modification for purposes of the acid rain program
shall be governed by regulations promulgated under Title IV of
the federal Clean Air Act.
<ol type=i>
<li>Minor permit modification procedures.
<ol type=I>
<li>Minor permit modification procedures may be used only for
those permit modifications that:
<ol type=I>
<li>Do not violate any applicable requirement;
<li>Do not involve significant changes to existing monitoring,
reporting, or recordkeeping requirements in the permit;
<li>Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of
an emission limitation or other standard, or a source specific
determination for temporary sources of ambient impacts, or a visibility
or increment analysis;
<li>Do not seek to establish or change a permit term or condition
for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement
and that the source has assumed to avoid an applicable requirement
to which the source would otherwise be subject, including a federally
enforceable emissions cap assumed to avoid classification as a
modification under any provision of <a href="391-3-03.htm #08">391-3-03(8)</a>, and an alternative
emissions limit approved pursuant to regulations promulgated under
section 112(j)(5) of the federal Clean Air Act;
<li>Are not modifications under any provision of <a href="391-3-03.htm #08">391-3-03(8)</a>;
and
<li>Are not required by this section (10) to be processed as a
significant modification.
<li>Are below 10 percent of the emissions allowed by the permit

or solvent, by percent weight, measured using the EPA Method 311,
or an equivalent or alternative method (or formulation data if
the coating meets the criteria specified in 40 CFR 63.805(a));
the solids content of a finishing material or contact adhesive
by percent weight, determined using data from the EPA Method 24,
or an alternative or equivalent method (or formulation data if
the coating meets the criteria specified in 40 CFR 63.805(a));
and the density, measured by EPA Method 24 or an alternative or
equivalent method. Therefore, the reportable HAP content should
represent the maximum aggregate emissions potential of the finishing
material, adhesive, or solvent in concentrations greater than
or equal to 1.0 percent by weight or 0.1 percent for HAP that
are carcinogens, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910), as
formulated.
<P>
(Note: Because the optimum analytical conditions under EPA Method
311 vary by coating, the coating or adhesive supplier may also
choose to include on the CPDS the optimum analytical conditions
for analysis of the coating, adhesive, or solvent using EPA Method
311. Such information may include, but not be limited to, separation
column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection port temperature,
extraction solvent, and internal standard.)
<li>&quot;Coating&quot; means a protective, decorative, or functional
film applied in a thin layer to a surface. Such materials include,

<h4>391-3-04 Air Pollution Episodes. Amended.</h4>
<ol type=1>
<li>In order to prevent the occurrence of air contaminant concentrations
great enough to cause danger to the public health, the Director
will proclaim that an Air Pollution Alert, Air Pollution Warning,
or Air Pollution Emergency exists when the meteorological conditions
are such that an air stagnation condition is in existence and/or
the accumulation of air contaminants in any place is attaining
or has attained levels which could, if such levels are sustained
or exceeded, lead to a substantial threat to the health of persons
in the specific area affected.
<li>The Director will maintain a listing of specific air contaminant
concentrations which, if reached or exceeded at any monitoring
site, will give rise to the proclamation of a respective air pollution
episode level. This listing will be available and furnished to
any interested person upon request to the Director. These ambient
concentration levels will be in graded levels with more restrictive
control requirements being necessary as the concentrations progress
upward, with the Air Pollution Emergency level being one which
should never be reached and the most stringent control actions
are necessary for reduction of air contaminant levels in the atmosphere.
<li>The proclamation of an air pollution episode level can be
for a specific, limited area affected by certain emissions, and
shall always be accompanied by the expectation of air stagnation
conditions for twelve (12) hours or more.
<li>Upon the request of the Director, any source owner, operator,
or lessee shall prepare and furnish to the Director written Air
Pollution Episode plans for use in reducing the emission of air
contaminants when the source is notified of the existence of an
Air Pollution Alert, Warning or Emergency in its area of influence.
Such plans shall identify the sources of air contaminants, the
amount of reduction to be achieved, the method by which the reduction
will be accomplished, and the times required to put each such
reduction step into effect. The plan will specify progressively
more stringent control actions to be taken at each of the air
pollution episode levels, with the Alert level needing the least
reduction and the Emergency level requiring the most reduction
of emissions. The submitted Air Pollution Episode plan shall be
subject to review and approval by the Director. If the plan is
judged to be inadequate by the Director, it shall be disapproved
and an amended plan will be prepared and resubmitted by the source
owner, operator, or lessee.
<li>When notified by the Director of the existence of an Air Pollution
Alert, Warning, or Emergency in an area influenced by its emissions
the source owner, operator, or lessee shall immediately put into
effect the control actions enumerated in the approved pollution
episode plan on file with the Director, as appropriate for the
specific episode level in effect.
<li>Once proclaimed by the Director, an air pollution episode
level will remain in effect until the criteria for air contaminant
concentrations applicable to the respective level are no longer
met. At such time, the next lower status will be assumed.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#0000FF" vlink="#808099" alink="#FF0000">
<h4>391-3-05 Regulatory Exceptions. Amended.</h4>
<ol type=1>
<li>The Director may grant specific or general classes of exceptions
to the particular requirements of any rule, regulation, or general
order, to such specific persons or class of persons or such specific
existing stationary (as of June 1, 1972) source or general class
of such sources subject to any requirement of, under, or pursuant
to the Georgia Air Quality Act, upon such conditions as he may
deem necessary to protect the public health, and welfare, if,
upon petition, he finds that strict compliance with such rule,
regulation, or general order is inappropriate for one of the following
reasons:
<ol type=a>
<li>Because of conditions beyond the control of petitioner; or
<li>Because of special circumstances which would render strict
compliance unreasonable, unduly burdensome, or impracticable due
to special physical conditions or causes; or
<li>Because strict compliance would result in substantial curtailment
or closing of the business or operation; or
<li>Because no alternative facility or method of handling is available.
</ol>
<li>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) above, the
Director shall not in any case authorize an exception to any requirement,
unless such exception fully complies with an approved State Implementation
Plan meeting all the requirements of Title I, Part D, of the Federal
Act, all the requirements for an approvable revision to the State
Implementation Plan pursuant to 40 USC Section 7410(a), as amended
and all the requirements under 42 USC Section 7411, as amended,
and 42 USC Section 7412, as amended. Any exception granted is
and shall be subject to O.C.G.A. Section 12-9-18, as amended,
and the Administrator's emergency powers under Title III, Section
303 of the Federal Act. No exception to any State Implementation
Plan requirement shall become effective until the Plan revision
based upon such exception is approved by EPA. If a State Plan
revision based upon an exception has been approved as part of
the State Implementation Plan by EPA, and is subsequently disapproved
by EPA, the exception shall be immediately void and of no affect,
and the general regulatory requirement shall apply to the person
or source to which such exception applied before the disapproval.
In the event of such disapproval, the affected person or source
shall meet the regulation requirements as expeditiously as practicable.
<li>Any person or persons seeking an exception to any regulation
requirement shall do so by filing a petition for such exception
with the Director. The Director shall promptly investigate such
petition and shall cause the petitioner to have published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the area of the source to
which the exception, if granted, is to apply, notice of the request
for such exception, notice of the date, time, and place of a public
hearing to be held to receive comments upon and evidence with
regard to the granting of such petition, and notice of the person
to whom and the address at which comments may be mailed, within
30 days after the notice is published. Upon consideration of all
the evidence and supporting data submitted by the petitioner,
and upon consideration of all evidence and comments received by
mail, postmarked within 30 days of the date of publication of
the notice, the Director shall issue an order, either denying
or granting the requested exception. Any exception granted may
be limited in time. Any exception may be conditioned upon compliance
with interim or alternate standards, limitations, or requirements
and shall contain a schedule requiring compliance with the regulation
to which the exception is granted as expeditiously as practicable.
The Director shall evaluate the petition and the consequences
of granting or denying the requested exception consistent with
the public health, safety and welfare.
<li>Any person aggrieved by the order of the Director upon such
petition may request a review of such order in accordance with
the provisions of O.C.G.A. Section 12-9-15.
<li>Any exception granted may be revoked or modified by the Director
after a public hearing which shall be held after giving at least
fifteen (15) days notice to all persons known to the Director
who will be subjected to greater restrictions or more stringent
regulatory requirements if such exception is revoked or modified,
and to any person or persons who have filed with the Director
a specific written request for such modification. Any order of
the Director revoking or modifying any exception previously granted,
may be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A.
Section 12-9-15; provided, however, that during the pendency of
any such review the source or person to whom the exception applied
prior to such revocation or modification shall as expeditiously
as practicable comply fully with the general regulatory requirements
if the order is one of revocation or the terms of the modified
exception if the order is one of modification after issuance and
notice of the Director's order of revocation or modification.
Any notice required herein may be made upon petitioner by mailing
(U.S. Post Office, adequate postage) a copy of the notice to order
to either the address appearing on the application for a permit
for the affected source or to such other address as the petitioner
may provide, and upon any other person by mailing to the address
provided in the persons specific request for modification.

<title>Management of Yard Trimmings</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<h3 align=center><strong>GUIDANCE DOCUMENT<br>
Management of Yard Trimmings<br>
O.C.G.A. 12-8-40.2</strong><br>
</h3>
<p><strong><u>LEGISLATIVE INTENT</u></strong><br>
<tt>In the past, most yard trimmings have either been land filled or burned.<br>
Because yard trimmings may constitute up to 15% of waste entering <br>
landfills, and the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Act sets a 25% <br>
disposal reduction goal, management of yard trimmings by means other than<br>
land filling is critical.</tt></p>
<p><tt><br>
</tt>In O.C.G.A. 12-8-21.(g), the legislative intent for the handling of yard trimming is stated as follows:<br>
</p>
<pre>     <em><strong>&quot;It is further the intent of the General Assembly to provide a frame
 of reference for the state and all counties,municipal corporations, and 
solid waste management authorities in the state relating to the handling
of yard trimmings. The productivity of the soils of Georgia requires that
nature's way of recycling vegetative matter be respected and followed and
that such essential building materials are no longer wasted by being buried
in landfills but are returned to the soil.  The General Assembly, therefore,
adopts and recommends the following hierarchy for handling yard trimmings:</strong></em></pre>
<pre>     (1)  Naturalized, low-maintenance landscaping requiring little or not cutting;
     (2)  Grass cycling by mowing it high and letting it lie;
     (3)  Stacking branches into brush piles for use as wildlife habitats and for
          gradual decomposition into the soil;
     (4)  Composting on the site where the material was grown, followed by
          incorporation of the finished compost into the soil at that site;
     (5)  Chipping woody material on the site where such material was generated;
     (6)  Collecting yard trimmings and transporting them to another site to be
          chipped or composted for later
          use; and
     (7)  Chipping woody material for later use as fiber fuel.&quot;
</pre>
<p><strong><u>DEFINITION OF YARD TRIMMINGS</u></strong><br>
<tt>The Act defines yard trimmings as follows:</tt></p>
<pre> O.C.G.A. 12-8-22.(42) - <em>&quot;yard trimmings means leaves, brush, grass clippings,
 shrub and tree prunings,  discarded Christmas trees, nursery and greenhouse 
 vegetative residuals, and vegetative matter resulting from landscaping development
 and maintenance other than mining, agricultural and silvacultural operations.&quot;</em></pre>
<pre>Although it is recommended that land-clearing debris (trees, stumps, limbs, etc.) be
managed in the same manner as yard trimmings, it is important to note that these
materials are not legally considered yard trimmings and are therefore, not
banned from landfills.</pre>
<pre>SWM-GD Management of Yard Trimmings 2/96
</pre>
<p><strong><u>YARD TRIMMINGS DISPOSAL BAN</u></strong><br>
<tt>In order to encourage the reuse of yard trimmings, and to conserve 
landfill capacity, the Act at O.C.G.A. 12-8-40.2 established disposal 
restrictions of such waste in certain landfills.</tt></p>
<pre>Effective September 1, 1996, each city, county, or solid waste management
authority shall impose restrictions on handling for yard trimmings generated
or disposed of in respective jurisdictions.  These restrictions shall include,
but are not limited to, the following:
</pre>
<pre>1.   Yard trimmings must be separated from all municipal solid waste in order
     to facilitate collections and ultimate handling.
</pre>
<pre>2.   Disposal of yard trimmings is banned at certain types of landfills.
     These landfills include:</pre>
<ul>
<li><pre>all municipal solid waste landfills with liners/leachate collection systems. </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>all municipal solid waste landfills which have received a vertical expansion
under the Act (NOTE: this also includes all construction and demolition
landfills which have received a vertical expansion under the Act, since
they are considered a form of municipal solid waste landfill). </pre>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>3.   Disposal of yard trimmings are not banned at certain types of landfills.
     These landfills include:</pre>
<ul>
<li><pre>private industry landfills which take solid waste from their own industry
only; and </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>inert waste landfills which are considered permit-by-rule facilities. </pre>

<ul>
<li><pre>sorted and stockpiled, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>chipped, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>composted, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>used as a mulch, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>otherwise beneficially reused or recycled to the extent feasible. </pre>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>While the yard trimmings disposal restrictions must be in place for
all jurisdictions not later than September 1, 1996, the Act encourages
each city, county, or solid waste management authority to take the
initiative to impose such restrictions prior to September 1, 1996.</pre>

<h4><u>Carriers/Permits Issues</u></h4>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will a retail dealer, hauling its own scrap tires, be required to have a Carrier Permit? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How is the Manifest used if a Carrier picks up 100 tires, salvages 20 tires for reuse, 
then transports the remaining 80 tires to processors or landfills, etc.? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) Carrier becomes a processor during the sorting operation, and must be approved by EPD. 
(b)Carrier must initiate a second set of Manifests for the 80 scrap tires. The twenty (20) tires<br>
for reuse will not be manifested. <br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will Carrier Permits be permanent or renewable? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Permits will be permanent as long as financial assurance (Bond or Letter of Credit) is 
valid. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a fee for obtaining a Carrier Permit?<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: No; however, a $5000.00 or $10,000.00 Bond or Letter of Credit is required and the 
insurance companies and banks usually charge an initial fee plus annual renewable fees. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will scrap tire carriers based in other states be required to have Carrier Permits? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes; whether they transport scrap tires into or out of Georgia<br>
</p>
<hr align=left>
<p><u>Generators/ID#'s Issues</u><br>
<br>
<strong>Question</strong>: Will city, county, and state vehicle maintenance shops be required to have ID Numbers 
and Carrier Permits? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: All governmental agencies must have a Generator ID Number if they generate scrap tires. <br>
They will not be required to have Carrier Permits in order to transport scrap tires. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong> : What is required of companies who have their own vehicle maintenance shops and 
generate scrap tires? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) Company must have ID Number as a Generator and manifest the tires to an approved state<br>
processing or disposal facility.<br>
(b) Company will not be required to have a Carrier Permit to transport its own company-generated 
scrap tires.<br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will a large retail dealer chain be required to have an ID Number for each of its stores? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. ID Numbers are site specific, therefore, each store location must have its own ID#. </p>
<hr align=left>
<h4><u>Manifests Issues</u></h4>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will retail dealers be required to submit copies of scrap tire shipment manifests to the<br>
Environmental Protection Division? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. Copies of completed manifests should be maintained for three years by dealers, 
carriers, and processors, users or disposers. EPD inspectors may from time to time review these<br>
manifest files as part of the tracking system. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is a scrap tire Generator required to manifest used tires and retreadable casings? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Used tires and casings do not have to be manifested if they are pre-sorted prior to 
transport. If the tires are not pre-sorted, all must be manifested.<br>
</p>
<hr align=left>
<h4><u>General Issues</u></h4>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Which tire handlers have to keep records? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Retail dealers, generators, carriers, end users, processors and disposers must keep 
accurate records. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Who is required to report to the Environmental Protection Division (EPD)? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) Carriers must report annually the number and disposition of scrap tires.<br>
(b) Retail dealers must remit $1.00 for each new tire sold on a quarterly basis.<br>
(c) Processors must report quarterly the number of scrap tires processed.</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How do used tire dealers fit into the Scrap Tire law? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><br>
(a) When mixed tires (scrap, used and recyclable casings) are picked up from the original 
generator, the used tire dealer must sign the Manifest as both the Carrier and the state-approved 
Tire Processor.<br>
<br>
(b) Used tire dealers who pick up tires, sort them, then transport scrap tires must have:<br>
1. ID# as a Generator/Processor of scrap tires<br>
2. Carrier Permit as a transporter of the scrap tires<br>
3. Initiate a second Manifest for the scrap tires that are sorted from recyclable casings and<br>
reusable tires (which are not considered scrap tires) </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is a tire Retreader required to have ID#'s or Permits? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) If only retreadable casings are transported to the retreader, Permits will not be required.<br>
(b) If a Retreader picks up scrap tires, salvages the casings, then transports <br>
rejects to a landfill or processor, he will be required to have a Scrap Tire Carrier Permit, be an<br>
approved state processor, and must initiate another manifest as a Generator. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will EPD provide lists of approved scrap tire carriers, processors, and disposers? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes; EPD will periodically provide updated lists of all three handlers. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will grants and loans for implementing innovative technologies for recycling be available 
to individuals or companies? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How many tires can be stored at various facilities? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Different storage limits have been placed on scrap tire handling facilities as follows: <br>
1. Solid Waste Disposal sites - number to be approved by EPD<br>
2. Retail Tire Dealer - 3000 scrap tires<br>
3. Tire Retreader - 1500 scrap tires<br>

<p>(v)		Instream concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) must not exceed 0.0000012 g/l under long-term average
stream flow conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		Applicable State and Federal requirements and regulations for the discharge of radioactive substances shall be met at all times.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		The dissolved oxygen criteria as specified in individual water use classifications shall be applicable at a depth of one meter below
the water surface; in those instances where depth is less than two meters, the dissolved oxygen criterion shall be applied at a mid-depth.  On a case specific basis, alternative depths may be specified.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(6)		Specific Criteria for Classified Water Usage</strong>.  In addition to the general criteria, the following criteria are deemed necessary and
shall be required for the specific water usage as shown:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Drinking Water Supplies:<strong>  </strong>Those waters approved as a source for public drinking water systems permitted or to be permitted by
the Environmental Protection Division.  Waters classified for drinking water supplies will also support the fishing use and any other
use requiring water of a lower quality.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		Bacteria:  For the months of May through October, when water contact recreation activities are expected to occur, fecal coliform
not to exceed a geometric mean of 200 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours. Should water quality and sanitary studies show fecal coliform levels from non-human
sources exceed 200/100 ml (geometric mean) occasionally, then the allowable geometric mean fecal  coliform shall not exceed 300
per 100 ml in lakes and reservoirs and 500 per 100 ml in free flowing freshwater streams.  For the months of November through
April, fecal coliform not to exceed a geometric mean of 1,000 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given
sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours and not to exceed a maximum of 4,000 per 100 ml for any
sample.  The State does not encourage swimming in surface waters since a number of factors which are beyond the control of any
State regulatory agency contribute to elevated levels of fecal coliform.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		Dissolved oxygen:  A daily average of 6.0 mg/l and no less than 5.0 mg/l at all times for waters designated as trout streams by the
Wildlife Resources Division.  A daily average of 5.0 mg/l and no less than 4.0 mg/l at all times for water supporting warm water
species of fish.

<p>(iii)		pH:  Within the range of 6.0 - 8.5.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)		No material or substance in such concentration that, after treatment by the public water treatment system, exceeds the maximum
contaminant level established for that substance by the Environmental Protection Division pursuant to the Georgia Rules for Safe
Drinking Water.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)		Temperature:  Not to exceed 90<sup></sup>F.  At no time is the temperature of the receiving waters to be increased more than 5<sup></sup>F above intake
temperature except that in estuarine waters the increase will not be more than 1.5<sup></sup>F.  In streams designated as primary trout or
smallmouth bass waters by the Wildlife Resources Division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures.  In streams
designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding 2<sup></sup>F of natural stream temperatures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		Recreation:  General recreational activities such as water skiing, boating, and swimming, or for any other use requiring water of
a lower quality, such as recreational fishing. These criteria are not to be interpreted as encouraging water contact sports in proximity
to sewage or industrial waste discharges regardless of treatment requirements:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		Bacteria:  Fecal coliform not to exceed the following geometric means based on at least four samples collected from a given
sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(1)		Coastal waters	100 per 100 ml

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)		All other recreational waters   200 per 100 ml

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(3)		Should water quality and sanitary studies show natural fecal coliform levels exceed 200/100 ml (geometric mean) occasionally in
high quality recreational waters, then the allowable geometric mean fecal coliform level shall not exceed 300 per 100 ml in lakes
and reservoirs and 500 per 100 ml in free flowing fresh water streams.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		Dissolved Oxygen:  A daily average of 6.0 mg/l and no less than 5.0 mg/l at all times for waters designated as trout streams by the
Wildlife Resources Division.  A daily average of 5.0 mg/l and no less than 4.0 mg/l at all times for waters supporting warm water

<p>(iii)		pH:  Within the range of 6.0 - 8.5.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)		Temperature:  Not to exceed 90F.  At no time is the temperature of the receiving waters to be increased more than 5F above
intake temperature except that in estuarine waters the increase will not be more than 1.5<sup></sup>F.  In streams designated as primary trout
or smallmouth bass waters by the Wildlife Resources Division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures.  In
streams designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding 2F natural stream temperatures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		Fishing:  Propagation of Fish, Shellfish, Game and Other Aquatic Life; secondary contact recreation in and on the water; or for any
other use requiring water of a lower quality:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		Dissolved Oxygen:  A daily average of 6.0 mg/l and no less than 5.0 mg/l at all times for water designated as trout streams by the
Wildlife Resources Division.  A daily average  of 5.0 mg/l and no less than 4.0 mg/l at all times for waters supporting warm water
species of fish.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		pH:  Within the range of 6.0 - 8.5.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)		Bacteria:  For the months of May through October, when water contact recreation activities are expected to occur, fecal coliform
not to exceed a geometric mean of 200 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours. Should water quality and sanitary studies show fecal coliform levels from non-human
sources exceed 200/100 ml (geometric mean) occasionally, then the allowable geometric mean fecal coliform shall not exceed 300
per 100 ml in lakes and reservoirs and 500 per 100 ml in free flowing freshwater streams.  For the months of November through
April, fecal coliform not to exceed a geometric mean of 1,000 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given
sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours and not to exceed a maximum of 4,000 per 100 ml for any
sample.  The State does not encourage swimming in surface waters since a number of factors which are beyond the control of any
State regulatory agency contribute to elevated levels of fecal coliform. For waters designated as approved shellfish harvesting
waters by the appropriate State agencies, the requirements will be consistent with those established by the State and Federal
agencies responsible for the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The requirements are found in the National Shellfish Sanitation
Program Manual of Operation, Revised 1988, Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, U. S.  Department of Health and Human
Services (PHS/FDA), and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  Streams designated as generally supporting shellfish
are listed in Paragraph 391-3-6-.03(14).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)		Temperature:  Not to exceed 90<sup></sup>F.  At no time is the temperature of the receiving waters to be increased more than 5<sup></sup>F above intake
temperature except that in estuarine waters the increase will not be more than 1.5F.  In streams designated as primary trout or
smallmouth bass waters by the Wildlife Resources Division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures.  In streams
designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding 2<sup></sup>F natural stream temperatures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		Wild River:  For all waters designated in 391-3-6-.03(13) as "Wild River," there shall be no alteration of natural water quality from
any source.

<p>	

<p>(e)		Scenic River:  For all waters designated in 391-3-6-.03(13) as "Scenic River," there shall be no alteration of natural water quality
from any source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		Coastal Fishing:  This classification will be applicable to specific sites when so designated by the Environmental Protection Division. 
For waters designated as "Coastal Fishing", site specific criteria for dissolved oxygen will be assigned and detailed by footnote in
Section 391-3-6-.03(3), "Specific Water  Use Classifications." All other criteria and uses for the fishing use classification will apply
for coastal fishing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong> (7)</strong>	<strong>	Natural Water Quality</strong>.  It is recognized that certain natural waters of the State may have a quality that will not be within the general
or specific requirements contained herein. This is especially the case for the criteria for dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and
fecal coliform.  NPDES permits and best management practices will be the primary mechanisms for ensuring that discharges will
not create a harmful situation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong> (8)</strong>		<strong>Treatment Requirements</strong>.  Notwithstanding the above criteria, the requirements of the State relating to secondary or equivalent
treatment of all waste shall prevail.  The adoption of these criteria shall in no way preempt the treatment requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong> (9)</strong>		<strong>Streamflows</strong>.  Specific criteria or standards set for the various parameters apply to all flows on regulated streams. On unregulated
streams, they shall apply to all streamflows equal to or exceeding the 7-day, 10-year minimum flow (7Q10). All references to 7-day,
10-year minimum flow (7Q10) also apply to all flows on regulated streams.  All references to annual average stream flow also apply
to long-term average stream flow conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(10) 	Mixing Zone</strong>.  Effluents released to streams or impounded waters shall be fully and homogeneously dispersed and mixed insofar
as practical with the main flow or water body by appropriate methods at the discharge point.  Use of a reasonable and limited mixing
zone may be permitted on receipt of satisfactory evidence that such a zone is necessary and that it will not create an objectionable
or damaging pollution condition. Protection from acute toxicity shall be provided within any EPD designated mixing zone to ensure
a zone of safe passage for aquatic organisms.  The procedure is as described in paragraph 391-3-6-.06(4)(d)(5)(vi), except that
the numerical pass/fail criteria applies to the end-of-pipe without the benefit of dilution provided by the receiving stream.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(11)</strong> <strong>	Toxic Pollutant Monitoring</strong>.  The Division will monitor waters of the State for the presence or impact of Section 307 (a)(l) Federal
Clean Water Act toxic pollutants<strong>,</strong> and other priority pollutants.  The monitoring shall consist of the collection and assessment of
chemical and/or biological data as appropriate from the water column, from stream bed sediments, and/or from fish tissue.  Specific
stream segments and chemical constituents for monitoring shall be determined by the Director on the basis of the potential for water
quality impacts from toxic pollutants from point or nonpoint waste sources.  Singularly or in combination, these constituents may
cause an adverse effect on fish propagation at levels lower than the criteria.  Instream concentrations will be as described in 391-3-6-.03 (5)(d).  Additional toxic substances and priority pollutants will be monitored on a case specific basis using Section 304(a)
Federal Clean Water Act guidelines or other scientifically appropriate documents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(12)</strong>	<strong>	Fecal Coliform Criteria</strong>.  The criteria for fecal coliform bacteria provide the regulatory framework to support the USEPA
requirement that States protect all waters for the use of primary contact recreation or swimming.  This is a worthy national goal,
although potentially unrealistic with the current indicator organism, fecal coliform bacteria, in use today.  To assure that waters are
safe for swimming indicates a need to test waters for pathogenic bacteria.  However, analyses for pathogenic bacteria are expensive
and results are generally difficult to reproduce quantitatively.  Also, to ensure the water is safe for swimming would require a whole
suite of tests be done for organisms such as <u>Salmonella</u>, <u>Shigella</u>, <u>Vibrio</u>, etc. as the presence/absence of one organism would
not document the presence/absence of another.  This type of testing program is not possible due to resource constraints.  The
environmental community in the United States has based the assessment of the bacteriological quality of water on testing for
pathogenic indicator organisms, principally the coliform group.  The assessment of streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries in Georgia
and other States is based on fecal coliform organisms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Coliform bacteria live in the intestinal tract of warm blooded animals including man.  These organisms are excreted in extremely
high numbers, averaging about 1.5 billion coliform per ounce of human feces.  Pathogenic bacteria also originate in the fecal
material of diseased persons.  Therefore, waters with high levels of fecal coliform bacteria represent potential problem areas for
swimming.  However, there is no positive scientific evidence correlating elevated fecal coliform counts with transmission of enteric
diseases.  In addition, these bacteria can originate from any warm blooded animal or from the soil.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Monitoring programs have documented fecal coliform levels in excess of the criteria in many streams and rivers in urban areas,
agricultural areas, and even in areas not extensively impacted by man such as national forest areas.  This is not a unique situation
to Georgia as similar levels of fecal coliform bacteria have been documented in streams across the nation.  The problem appears
to lie in the lack of an organism which specifically indicates the presence of human waste materials which can be correlated to
human illness.  Other organisms such as the Enterococci group and <u>E. coli</u> have been suggested by the USEPA as indicator
organisms.  However, testing using these organisms by States and the USEPA has indicated similar problems with these indicator
organisms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		The Environmental Protection Division will conduct a monitoring project from 1993 through 1995 to evaluate the use of <u>E. coli</u> and
Enterococci as indicators of bacteriological quality in Georgia.  The Environmental Protection Division will also conduct studies to
determine if a better human specific indicator can be found to replace current indicator organisms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(13)</strong>		<strong>Specific Water Use Classifications</strong>.  Beneficial water uses assigned by the State to all surface waters.  These classifications are scientifically determined to be the best utilization of the surface water from an environmental and economic
standpoint.  Streams and stream reaches not specifically listed are classified as Fishing.  The specific classifications are
as follows:

<p><strong><strong>391-3-6-.06  Waste Treatment and Permit Requirements.  Amended.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(1)	Purpose.  </strong>The purpose of this Paragraph 391-3-6-.06 is to provide for the degree of waste treatment required and the uniform
procedures and practices to be followed relating to the application for issuance, modification, revocation and reissuance, and
termination of permits for the discharge of any pollutant into the waters of the State.  Requirements applicable to general NPDES
permits are provided in subparagraphs 391-3-6-.15 and 391-3-6-.16.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(2)	Definitions</strong>.  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act unless
otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)	"Annual average stream flow" means that flow measured daily at the nearest listed U.S. Geologic Survey stream gauge, averaged
for the entire period of record, and adjusted by comparison to the size of the drainage area in which the discharge is located.

<p>	

<p>	(b)	"Aquaculture project" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R.  122.25;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)	"Concentrated animal feeding operation" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40
C.F.R.  122.23;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)	"Concentrated aquatic animal production facility" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal
Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.24;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)	"Construction" means any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment (including contractual obligations to
purchase such facilities or equipment) at the premises where such equipment will be used, including preparation work at such
premises;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(f)	"Dilution factor" means a numerical representation of the dilution of the permitted effluent from the wastewater treatment facility
in the receiving stream.  It shall be used to calculate instream concentrations of priority pollutants when the effluent concentration
is known and to calculate effluent limitations from the instream criteria concentration listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.	For constituents listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(I) and (ii), the dilution factor equals:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		<u>7-day, 10-year minimum stream flow (7Q10) + discharger design flow</u>

<p>		                   discharger design flow

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		For constituents listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(iii), the dilution factor equals:

<p><u>		Annual or long-term average stream flow + discharger design flow</u>

<p>		                  discharger design flow

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.	The dilution factor equations assume a relatively rapid and complex mix.  In situations where this does not occur, the Permittee or
EPD may perform field studies to document and describe the mixing zone.  The dilution factor in such situations, for the purpose
of calculating effluent limitations for chemical constituents, will be determined based on the studies. If a mixing zone is granted,
all criteria and requirements of subsection 391-3-6-.03(10) must also be met.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.	In situations where the dilution factor equations do not appropriately describe the dilution capacity of receiving waters, such as for
discharges to impounded waters or to tidal estuaries, the dilution factor will be determined through field studies or appropriate
analytical procedures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(g)	"Effluent Limitation" means any restriction or prohibition established under the Act on quantities, rates, or concentrations, or a
combination thereof, of chemical, physical, biological, or other constituents which are discharged from point sources into the waters

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(l)	"New Source" means any point source that meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.29;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(m)	"NPDES Permit Application" means the application filed by any person with the Director for an NPDES Permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(n)	"NPDES Permit" means the permit issued by the Division to regulate the discharge of pollutants from any point source into the
waters of the State;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(o)	"Segment" means a portion of a water quality planning area, the surface waters of which have common hydrologic characteristics
(or flow regulation patterns); common natural physical, chemical and biological characteristics and processes; and common
reactions to external stresses, such as the discharge of pollutants.  Segments will be classified as either a water quality segment

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 2.	Effluent limitation segment.  Any segment where it is known that water quality is meeting and will continue to meet applicable water
quality standards or where there is adequate demonstration that water quality will meet applicable water quality standards after the
application of the effluent limitations required by sections 301(b)(1)(B) and 301(b)(2)(A) of the Act."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(p)	"Separate storm sewer" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R.  122.26.

<p>(ii)		For the chemical constituents identified after completion of (I) above, and/or if other site specific information available to the EPD
indicates the presence of one or more of the above chemical constituents at levels of concern to EPD, the EPD will control the
chemical constituent in the NPDES permit with a monitoring provision or an effluent limit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		If the instream concentration, which is measured or calculated by dividing the effluent concentration by the appropriate dilution
factor from 391-3-6-.06(2)(f), is greater than the criteria concentration, then the permit will contain a monitoring requirement for
that constituent.  However, if the data requirements in 391-3-6-.06(4)(d)(5)(ii)(b) are met and the results indicate that a chemical
constituent's instream concentration is fifty percent or more of the instream standard, an effluent limit for that constituent will be
required at permit issuance, as below.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		The permit will provide that, after the permittee has monitored the chemical constituents for one year, the EPD will review the
monitoring results.

requirement for that constituent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)		If the results of at least ten monthly samples indicate that a chemical constituent's instream concentration is fifty percent or more
of the instream standard, the permit shall be modified to include an effluent limit for the chemical constituent calculated as follows:

<p>		Effluent limit = criteria concentration x dilution factor

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		If the permit is issued or modified as in (ii)(b)(2) above for a chemical constituent listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(ii), the limit shall
become effective upon issuance or modification of the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		At the request of the permittee, a schedule to allow for development of a site-specific effluent limit may be established by the EPD. 
This schedule would be contained in an accompanying Administrative Order and include the following:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(1)		A requirement for monthly monitoring for all chemical constituents that are limited.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)		A requirement that the permittee perform site-specific studies, consisting of whole effluent biomonitoring, water-effect ratio tests,
stream studies, or other appropriate studies or calculations.  The methodology for these tests will be determined by the EPD on
a case-by-case basis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(3)		A requirement that all data obtained in (2) and (3) be submitted to the EPD for review.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(4)		No more than two years following initiation of monitoring under (ii)(a), the EPD will use the data to calculate site-specific limitations
for each chemical constituent, and will initiate the process to incorporate the limitation(s) into the permit along with requirements
for a minimum of annual whole effluent biomonitoring.  At any time during the two year period the EPD may, upon its initiative or
that of the permittee, review the data that have been submitted and may determine that limits and monitoring requirements for one
or more chemical constituents may be terminated.  All modifications of limits and monitoring requirements will comply with
anti-backsliding requirements contained in Section 402(o) of the Clean Water Act.  Conversely, should the EPD determine that
adequate data are available before the two year interim monitoring period, it may develop site specific limitations for the
constituent(s) without additional monitoring.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		Any permit modifications or revocation/reissuances pursuant to (ii)(b)(2) or (ii)(d) will be performed in accordance with procedures
described in 391-3-6-.06(7), including public participation requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		For any metals monitored during any portion of the limits determination process, measurement will be by the most appropriate
analytical technique approved by the U.S. EPA which provides a measurement of the portion of the metal present which may
cause toxicity to aquatic life in the receiving stream.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> (iii)		For other 307(a) chemical constituents, including priority pollutants not identified in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(I)-(v) whole effluent
biomonitoring will be used to develop either a site-specific criteria concentration or a whole effluent toxicity limit, with such limits
to be incorporated into permits.  This paragraph applies to the following chemical constituents:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)	Chloroethane

<p>	(b)	1,1-Dichloroethane

<p>	(c)	1,2-Dichloropropane

<p>	(d)	1,1,1-Trichloroethane

<p>	(e)	2-Nitrophenol

<p>	(f)	4-Nitrophenol

<p>	(g)	Bis(2-Chloroethoxy)Methane

<p>	(h)	4-Bromophenyl Phenyl Ether

<p>	(I)	Butylbenzyl Phthalate

<p>	(j)	2-Chloronaphthalene

<p>	 (k)	4-Chlorophenyl Phenyl Ether

<p>	(l)	2,6-Dinitrotoluene

<p>	(m)Di-n-Octyl Phthalate

<p>	(n)	Naphthalene

<p>	(o)	d-BHC-Delta

<p>	(p)	Silver

<p>   	 (q)	Beryllium

<p>	(r)	2-Chloro ethyl vinyl ether

<p>	(s)	Methyl chloride (chloromethane)

<p>	(t)	Methylene chloride

<p>	(u)	1,2-Transdichloroethylene

<p>	(v)	2-Chlorophenol

<p>	(w) 2,4-Dimethylphenol

<p>	(x)	3-Methyl-4-Chlorophenol

<p>	(y)	Acenaphthene

<p>	(z)	Acenaphthylene

<p>	(aa)	Benzo (ghi) perylene

<p>	(bb)	N-Nitrosidi-n-propylamine

<p>	(cc)	Phenanthrene

<p>	(dd)	1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene

<p>	(iv)		The criteria concentration may be more stringent under either one of the following situations:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		If the chemical constituent exists in the upstream reaches of the receiving stream at any level greater than zero due to the presence
of other direct dischargers.  For this situation, the criteria concentration for computation of the effluent limit will be the net value
after subtracting out this initial concentration.  Unless actual water quality studies and monitoring or calculations indicate otherwise,
it will be assumed that the upstream levels of each constituent are zero; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		If the EPD determines that more stringent limitations should be imposed in order to reserve some assimilative capacity for future
discharges.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(v)		The effluent limit determined in (ii)(b)(2) above may be adjusted as follows, to determine the actual effluent limit to be used in the
permit:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		If the limit is more stringent than the analytical laboratory detection limit using analytical methods described in Federal Regulations
40 C.F.R. 136 or methods that have EPA concurrence, then the limit will include an accompanying statement in the permit that
a reading of not detected using the analytical methods specified in the permit will be considered as being in compliance with the
limit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		If water quality studies and monitoring indicate that the chemical constituent is present in the water supply or in the upstream
reaches of the receiving stream at a concentration equal to or exceeding the daily limit for the specific chemical constituent, and
the presence of such cannot be attributed to direct point source dischargers, or nonpoint sources that can be reasonably controlled
with best management practices, the limit will be set equal to the natural ambient concentration of the chemical constituent;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		For industrial point source dischargers, if the specific chemical constituent is regulated by a technology-based effluent  guideline
limit, the guideline limit will be compared to the calculated limit.  The limit will be the more stringent of the two values;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		For complex effluents, where several chemical constituents exist, the EPD will assign a limit for each specific chemical constituent
and may require a whole effluent biomonitoring limit where there is a reasonable potential that the narrative criteria for whole effluent
toxicity will be exceeded.  Such whole effluent biomonitoring limitation will consist of a series of bioassays of the wastewater
treatment plant effluent, and, if appropriate, toxicity source identification evaluations, and implementation steps to reduce the
chronic toxicity.  This approach shall not be applied to those chemical constituents considered potential or known carcinogens or
to the chemical constituents identified in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(iii).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(vi)  	NPDES permits issued or reissued after the adoption of this paragraph shall include biological monitoring provisions and, where
determined by the State to be necessary, a water quality-based whole effluent provision utilizing numerical pass/fail criteria to
manage the effluent for the additive effects of all Section 307(a)(1) Federal Clean Water Act toxic pollutants and other unknown
toxic substances or priority pollutants.  The water quality-based whole effluent approach will help to ensure that the wastewater
treatment plant effluent does not contain unknown sources of acute and chronic toxicity that may interfere with the designated water
quality use classifications of the receiving stream.  The whole effluent acute biological toxicity monitoring provision ensures
protection from acute toxicity within any designated mixing zone and helps to define alternate criteria to allow for the safe passage
of aquatic organisms through streams with 7-day, 10-year minimum flows approaching zero.  The numerical pass/fail criteria is
also a screening technique for use by the EPD to determine priority toxicity reduction needs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		To all new dischargers or new sources the following shall apply:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> 	 1.		Except as provided in subparagraph (e) 2. any new discharger on which construction commenced after October 18, 1972, or any
new source, which meets the applicable promulgated new source performance standards before the commencement of discharge,
shall not be subject to any more stringent new source performance standards, or to any more stringent technology-based standards
under section 301(b)(2) of the Federal Act for the shortest of the following periods:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(I)		Ten years from the date that construction is completed;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(ii)		Ten years from the date the source begins to discharge process or other non-construction related wastewater; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	iii)		The period of depreciation or amortization of the facility for the purposes of Section 167 or 169 (or both) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Comment:  The provisions of this subparagraph do not apply to existing sources which modify their pollution control facilities or construct new
pollution control facilities and achieve performance standards, but which are neither new sources nor new dischargers or otherwise do not
meet the requirements of this subparagraph.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 2.		The protection of more stringent standards of performance afforded by subparagraph (e) 1. of this section does not apply to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(I)		Additional or more stringent permit conditions which are not technology based, e.g., conditions based on water quality standards,
or effluent standards or prohibitions under Section 307(a) of the Federal Act; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(ii)		Additional permit conditions controlling pollutants listed as toxic under Section 307(a) of the Federal Act or as hazardous
substances under Section 311 of the Federal Act and which are not controlled by new source performance standards. This
includes permit conditions controlling pollutants other than those identified as toxic or hazardous where control of those other
pollutants has been specifically identified as the method to control the toxic or hazardous pollutant.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> 	 3.		Where an NPDES permit issued to a source enjoying a "protection period" under subparagraph (e) 1. will expire on or before the
expiration of the protection period, such permit shall require the owner or operator of the source to be in compliance with the
requirements of Section 301 of the Federal Act and any other applicable requirements of the Federal Act immediately upon the
expiration of the protection period. No additional period for achieving compliance with these requirements shall be allowed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 4.		The owner or operator of a new source, a new discharger, a source recommencing discharge after terminating operations, or a
source which has been an indirect discharger which commences discharging into navigable waters shall install and have in
operating condition, and shall "startup" all pollution control equipment required to meet the terms and conditions of its permits
before beginning to discharge.  Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), the owner or operator must meet all
permit terms and conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 5.		After the effective date of new source performance standards, in accordance with Section 306(e) of the Federal Act, it shall be
unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of those standards, applicable to such
source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(<strong>5)		Application for Permit.</strong>

with a schedule of compliance as set forth in such permit, or Order by the Director, or in the absence of a schedule of
compliance, by the date set forth in such permit which the Director has determined to be the shortest reasonable period
of time necessary to achieve such compliance, but in no case later than an applicable statutory deadline.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	In any case where the period of time for compliance specified in subparagraph 391-3-6-.06(10)(a) of these Rules exceeds
9 months, a schedule of compliance shall be specified which will set forth interim requirements and the dates for their
achievement.  In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between interim dates, and, to the extent practicable, the
interim dates shall fall on the last day of the months of March, June, September and December.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Within fourteen (14) days after an interim date of compliance of the final date of compliance, the permittee shall provide
the Director with written notice of its compliance or non-compliance with the requirements or conditions specified to be
completed by such date.  Failure to submit the written notice is just cause for the EPD to pursue enforcement action
pursuant to the Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	On the last working day of February, May, August, and November the Director shall submit to EPA information
concerning noncompliance with NPDES Permit requirements by major dischargers in the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		Any discharger who fails or refuses to comply with an interim or final date of compliance specified in a permit may
be deemed by the Director to be in violation of the permit and may be subject to enforcement action pursuant to the
Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(11)  	Monitoring, Recording and Reporting Requirements.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			Any discharge authorized by a permit issued pursuant to the Act may be subject to such monitoring, recording and
reporting requirements as may be reasonably required by the Director including the installation, use and maintenance
of monitoring equipment or methods; specific requirements for recording of monitoring activities and results; and
periodic reporting of monitoring results.  The monitoring, recording and reporting requirements shall be specified in a
permit when issued, provided, however, the Director may require additional monitoring, recording and reporting by
written notification to the permittee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		The monitoring requirements of any discharge authorized by any such permit shall be consistent with Federal
Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.41, 122.42, and 122.44 and applicable State laws.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Any permit which requires monitoring of the authorized discharge shall comply with the recording requirements
specified by Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.41 and applicable State laws.  The permittee shall be required to retain
any records of monitoring activities and results for a minimum of three (3) years, unless otherwise required or extended
by the Director upon written notification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		Any holder of a permit which requires monitoring of the authorized discharge shall report periodically to the EPD the
results of all required monitoring activities on appropriate forms supplied by the EPD.  The Director shall notify the
permittee of the frequency of reporting but in no case shall the reporting frequency be less than once per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(12) 	Modification, Revocation and Reissuance, and Termination of Permits.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		The Director may revise or modify the schedule of compliance set forth in an issued permit if the permittee requests
such modification or revision in writing and such modification or revision will not cause an interim date in the
compliance schedule to be extended more than one hundred twenty (120) days or affect the final date in the
compliance schedule.  The Director may grant requests in accordance with this subparagraph if he determines  after
documented showing by the permittee that good and valid cause (including Acts of God, strikes, floods, material
shortages or other events over which the permittee has little or no control) exists for such revision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		The Director in accordance with the provisions of Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.61, 122.62, 122.63, 122.64,
and 124.5, may modify, revoke  and reissue, or terminate an issued permit in whole or in part during its term for cause,
including, but not limited to, the causes listed in Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.62 and 122.64, or the cause listed
in the Act or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.  Prior to any such modification, revocation and reissuance, or
termination of an issued permit by the Director (other than modification or revision of a compliance schedule pursuant
to subparagraph (a) above, or modification in accordance with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. 122.63), the Director will
give public notice in accordance with the procedures set forth in subparagraph 391-3-6-.06(7)(b) and an opportunity
for public hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in subparagraph 391-3-6-.06(7)(c).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		In the case of a POTW which has received a grant under Section 202(a)(3) of the Federal Act to fund 100% of the
costs to modify or replace facilities construction with a grant for innovative and alternative wastewater technology
under Section 202(a)(2), the schedule of compliance may be modified to reflect the amount of time lost during
construction of the innovative or alternative facility.  In no case shall the compliance schedule be modified or extend
beyond an applicable statutory deadline for compliance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		New sources, new dischargers, sources which recommence discharging after terminating operations and those sources
which had been indirect dischargers which commence discharging directly into navigable waters do not qualify for
compliance schedules under this paragraph and are subject to Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.29(d)(4).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(13)   Non-governmentally Owned Sewerage Systems.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			In cases involving non-governmentally owned sewerage systems, a trust indenture or other legal contract or agreement,
approved by the EPD, assuring continuity of operation of the system, may be required to be filed with the application
for a permit.  This provision shall not be applicable to systems discharging only industrial waste.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(14)   Control of Disposal of Pollutants into Wells.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			If the permit proposes to discharge to a well or subsurface water, the Director shall specify additional terms and
conditions which shall (a) prohibit the proposed disposal, or (b) control the proposed disposal in order to prevent
pollution of ground and surface water resources and to protect the public health and welfare.  Any permit issued for
the disposal of pollutants into wells shall comply with Federal Regulations, and applicable State laws.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(15)  	Duration, Continuation and Transferability of Permits.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit issued under Section 10(3) and (4) of the Act shall have a fixed term not to exceed five (5) years.  Upon
expiration of such permit, a new permit may be issued by the Director in accordance with Section 10(6) of the Act
and Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.9 and 122.64 provided that an application for such new permit is filed with
the Director at least 180 days prior to the expiration date of the existing permit.  The issuance of such new permit shall
likewise have a fixed term not to exceed five (5) years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		A permit may be transferred to another person by a permittee in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 122.61 if:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 1.		The permittee notifies the Director of the proposed transfer;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 2.		A written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility and coverage between the current
and new permittees (including acknowledgment that the existing permittee is liable for violations up to that date, and
that the new permittee is liable for violations from that date on) is submitted to the Director; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 3.		The Director within thirty (30) days does not notify the current permittee and the new permittee of the EPD's intent
to modify, revoke and reissue, or terminate the permit and to require  that a new application be filed rather than
agreeing to the transfer of the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Comment:  A new application will be required where the change of ownership is accompanied by a change or proposed change
in process or wastewater characteristics or a change or potential change in any circumstances that the Director believes will
affect the conditions or restrictions in the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		When the permittee has submitted a timely and sufficient application for a new NPDES permit and the Director is
unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue the new permit before the expiration date of the existing permit, then
the Director shall extend the existing permit until a new permit is issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		For those industrial categories for which EPA will establish effluent limitations based on best available technology,
permits will be issued to ensure compliance with the effluent limits by the statutory deadline.  This will be
accomplished by utilizing short-term permits and/or reopener clauses that will allow the permit to be modified, revoked,
reissued to comply with limitations promulgated pursuant to the Act and subsequent regulations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) above, if a toxic effluent standard or prohibition (including any schedule of
compliance specified in such effluent standard or prohibition) is established under Section 307(a) of the Act for a toxic
pollutant which is present in a discharge and such standard prohibition is more stringent than any limitation for such
pollutant in a permit, the permit shall be revised or modified in accordance with the toxic effluent standard or
prohibition and the permittee so notified.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(16) 	Enforcement.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			Any person who violates any provision of the Act, any rule promulgated and adopted pursuant thereto, or any term,

<p>(I)		For applications for new or modified permits to withdraw, impound or divert surface water:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		No permit will be issued by the Director which authorizes the depletion of the instream flow established for the withdrawal, diversion
or impoundment of surface water, except for periods of Emergency Water Shortage as described in Subsection 391-3-6-.07(12);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(II)	For applications for new or modified permits, the applicant will be required to pass instream flow at or immediately downstream of
the point of withdrawal, diversion or impoundment so long as it is available from upstream.  When upstream flows drop below the
required instream flow at the point of withdrawal, diversion or impoundment, the applicant will be required to pass that upstream flow. 
The Instream Flow required for new or modified permits in this subsection shall be:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I.		The 7Q10 flow, if no unreasonable adverse effects to the stream or other water users will occur from the withdrawal, diversion or
impoundment; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(III)	Low-flow monitoring plan that outlines applicant's procedure to monitor and protect instream flow below the point of withdrawal. 
Where applicable, the applicant must develop a plan for monitoring stream flow so that the instream flow limit can be protected.  The
monitoring plan must determine stream flow based on one of the following:

prior dealings with the Division may be incorporated into the application by specific and detailed reference and a statement that the
information is still valid and correct.

<p>	

<p>(5)		Permit Applications:  Farm Uses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Prior Uses.  A permit for the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm uses shall be issued by the Director to any person
when the applicant submits an application which provides reasonable proof that the applicant's farm use of surface waters occurred
prior to July 1, 1988, and when any such application is submitted prior to July 1, 1991.  If submitted prior to July 1, 1991, an
application for a permit to be issued based upon farm uses of surface waters occurring prior to July 1, 1988, shall be granted for
the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters at a rate of withdrawal or diversion equal to the greater of the operating capacity in
place for withdrawal or diversion on July 1, 1988, or, when measured in gallons per day on a monthly average for a calendar year,
the greatest withdrawal or diversion capacity during the five-year period immediately preceding July 1, 1988.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		New Uses.  If submitted after July 1, 1991, or regardless of when submitted, if it is based upon a withdrawal or diversion of surface
waters for farm use occurring or proposed to occur on or after July 1, 1988, an application shall be subject to evaluation and
classification pursuant to subsection 391-3-6-.07(4),-.07(6) and -.07(7) of these Rules; but a permit based upon such evaluation
and classification shall be issued to ensure the applicant's right to a reasonable use of such surface waters.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		Permittees shall submit application for withdrawal or diversion of water for farm use to the Division on forms to be supplied by the

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	11.		County map supplied by the Division (or equivalent) showing the location of the water source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(6)</strong>	<strong>	Combination Uses</strong>.  A combination of farm and non-farm surface water use shall be considered a non-farm surface use, unless
the director determines that the predominant use to which the water is put is farm use.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(7)</strong>	<strong>	System of Classification for Competing Permit Applications</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		In situations involving competing uses, existing or proposed, for a supply of available surface water, the Division 	shall consider:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		The number of persons using the particular water source and the object, extent and necessity of their respective withdrawals or uses;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Nature and size of water source;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Low flows during droughts of record;

<p>8.		The importance and necessity of the uses, including farm uses, claimed by permit applicants and the extent of any injury or detriment
caused or expected to be caused to other water uses;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>9.		Diversion from or reduction of flows in other watercourses;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>10.	The prior investments of any person in lands, and plans for the farm usage of water in connection with such lands, which plans have
been submitted to the Director within a reasonable time after July 1, 1988; provided that the granting of such a permit shall not have
unreasonably adverse effects upon other water uses in the area, including potential as well as present use;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	11.		The varying circumstances of each use.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(8)</strong>	<strong>	Priorities for Competing Applications</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		When there are competing applications for water from the same source, and the source is insufficient to supply all applicants, the
following order of priorities shall prevail:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		Emergency facilities for essential life support measures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.		Domestic and personal uses, including drinking, cooking, washing, sanitary purposes and all health related activities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.		Farm uses as defined herein.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	4.		Industrial uses (including those industries on public water systems).

<p>	5.		Other uses such as lawn sprinkling, noncommercial car washing, garden watering, etc.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	6.		Outdoor recreational uses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Competing applicants or users within the above categories shall be assigned a priority rating based upon a consideration of the
facts set forth in subsection 391-3-6-.07(6) of these Rules.  In the event two or more competing applicants or users qualify equally
under the priority rating, the Director will grant permits to such competing applicants, or modify the existing permits of the users,
for use of specified quantities of surface water on a prorated or other reasonable basis in those situations where such action is
feasible, provided, however, that the Director will give preference to an existing use over an initial application.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		The Division shall take into consideration the extent to which such withdrawals, diversions or impoundments are reasonably
necessary in the judgment of the Director to meet the applicant's reasonable needs; including the needs of any third party to whom
the permit applicant was furnishing water for the processing of perishable agricultural products which require minimum quantities
of water to comply with State or federal laws or regulations, and shall grant a permit which shall meet those reasonable needs;
provided, however, that the granting of such permit shall not have unreasonable adverse affect upon other water uses in the area
including but not limited to public use, farm use, and potential as well as present use, and provide, further, however, notwithstanding
the above, that the Director shall grant a permit to any permit applicant who on the effective date of this Act has outstanding
indebtedness in the form of revenue certificates or general obligation bonds which are being amortized through the sale of surface
water, the permitted quantity of such shall be at least in an amount consistent with the quantity for which the revenue certificates
or general obligation bonds were issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(9)</strong>		<strong>Duration of Permits</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit granted for the withdrawal, diversion or impoundment of surface waters shall be for a period of time not less than ten
(10) years (unless the applicant requests a shorter period of time) nor more than twenty (20) years, except that farm use permits
shall have no term and may be transferred or assigned to subsequent owners of the lands which are the subject of such permit. 
Provided, however, that the Division shall be notified in writing by the permittee of such transfer or assignment.  The Director may
authorize a permit of duration of up to fifty (50) years in the case of a municipality or other governmental body where such period
is required to provide for the retirement of bonds for the construction of water works or waste disposal facilities;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		If requested by the applicant, the Director may issue a temporary permit for less than ten (10) years, or a letter of concurrence for
transient uses lasting less than 180 days.  Applicant's concurrence with a draft permit whose duration is less than ten (10) years
shall serve as a request for a temporary permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(10)</strong>	<strong>	Renewal of Permits</strong>.  All permittees desiring to renew a permit shall submit an application for renewal to the Director within six
(6) months prior to its expiration.  All renewals will be treated in the same manner as the initial permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(11)</strong>	<strong>	Revocation, Suspension or Modification of Permits</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit granted for the withdrawal, diversion or impoundment of surface waters may be revoked, in whole or in part, permanently
or temporarily, for the following reasons:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		Any material false statement in an application for a permit or in any report required to be made;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.		Any willful violation of a condition of a permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.		Nonuse of the water supply (or a significant portion thereof) allowed by a permit for a period of two (2) consecutive years or more,
unless the permittee can reasonably demonstrate that his nonuse was due to extreme hardship caused by factors beyond his
control; except that this paragraph will not apply to farm use permits issued after initial use has commended;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	4.		With the written consent of the permittee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Any such permit may be revoked, in whole or in part, for a period not to exceed one (1) year for violation of any provision of Section
12-5-31, et seq. of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		Any such permit may be suspended or modified if the Director should determine that the quantity of water allowed under the permit
is greater than that needed by the permittee for the particular use upon which the application for permit was based, or would prevent
other applicants from reasonable use of surface waters, including farm use;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		The director may suspend or modify a farm use permit if he should determine through inspection, investigation, or otherwise that
the quantity of water allowed under the permit would prevent other applicants from reasonable use of surface waters for farm use;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		Consistent with the considerations set forth in Chapter 391-3-6-.07(7), any such permit may be revoked, suspended or modified
for any other good cause consistent with the health and safety of the citizens of this State and within the provisions of this Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(f)		In the event of modification, suspension or revocation of permit, the Director shall serve written notice of such action on the permit
holder and give the reason for such action.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(12)		Emergency Water Shortage</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit may be suspended, restricted or otherwise modified by emergency order of the Director when an emergency period of
water  shortages exists.  Prior to any such action, it must clearly appear to the Director from specific facts shown by affidavits of
residents of the affected area of this State that an emergency period of water shortage exists within such area, so as to place in
jeopardy the health or safety of the citizens of such area or to threaten serious harm to the water resources of the area.  Any
permittee has five (5) days from the date of mailing of the notice of the proposed change in the permit to appear in opposition to
the proposed action.  Except as to farm uses, any change, suspension or restriction in the permit is effective immediately upon
receipt of such order by the permittee, his agent for service of process, or any agent of employee of the permittee who receives the
notification at the permittee's principal place of business in the State.  Any permittee, other than a farm use permittee, to whom such
order is directed shall comply therewith immediately;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Upon application, the permittee, including a farm use permittee, shall be afforded a hearing before a hearing officer appointed by
the Department of Natural Resources within twenty (20) days of receipt of said application by the hearing officer.  Farm use
permittees may continue to make use of water to their permitted capacity during the appeal process, but failure to timely request
a hearing in accordance with Subsection (c) of Code Section 12-2-2 shall waive such right;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		In the event of dire emergency, only water for domestic and personal uses, for drinking, cooking, washing, sanitary purposes and
all health related activities will be permitted.  Farm uses will be given second priority; however, all other usages will be established
by the Director based on the priorities established in subsection 391-3-6-.07(7). The importance and necessity of water for industrial
purposes are in no way modified or diminished by this subsection;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		Upon expiration of the emergency period of water shortage, the permittee will be notified in writing of such expiration and the said
permittee may then operate under the permit as issued prior to the emergency.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(13)</strong>	<strong>	Request for Modification of Unexpired Permit</strong>.  A permittee may seek modification of any of the terms of an issued permit.  The
Director may modify such permit providing the permittee establishes at least one of the following:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		a change in conditions has resulted in a need by the permittee of more water than is allowed under the existing permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		The proposed modification would result in a more efficient use of water than is possible under the existing permit; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		A proposed change in conditions would result in a need by the permittee of more water than is allowed under the existing permit. 
Any such modification shall be consistent with the health and safety of the citizens of this State and with provisions of this Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(14)		Interbasin Transfer Permits</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		In the consideration of applications for permits which if granted would authorize the withdrawal and transfer of surface waters
across natural basins, the Director shall be bound by the following requirements:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		The Director shall give due consideration to competing existing uses and applications for permits which would not involve interbasin
transfer of surface water and, subject to subsection 391-3-6-.07(6), shall endeavor to allocate a reasonable supply of surface waters
to such users and applicants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Public Notification

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		A press release regarding the proposed issuance of a permit for interbasin transfer of surface water shall be given to newspapers
of general circulation in the area which would be affected by such issuance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.		The press release shall be issued at least seven (7) days before issuance of the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.		If the Director determines sufficient public interest exists, he shall hold a hearing somewhere within the area affected prior to the
issuance of the permit.  The Director shall provide reasonable public notice of such meeting.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		Interbasin Permits

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		A public advisory regarding the proposed issuance of a new permit shall be provided to one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the area of the applicant.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(15)</strong>		<strong>Records</strong>.  Except for farm use permits issued pursuant to subsection 391-3-6-.07(5), whenever required to carry out the objectives
of Section 12-5-31 et seq. of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, the Director may by order, permit or otherwise, in writing,
require any person holding a permit or any other person who the Director reasonably believes is unlawfully withdrawing, diverting
or impounding surface waters to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Establish and maintain records;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Make reports;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	the building, structure, facility or installation totally replaces the process or reduction equipment that causes the discharge
of pollutants at an existing source; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	the production or wastewater generating processes of the building, structure, facility or installation are substantially
independent of an existing source at the same site.  In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors
such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source should be considered.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a modification rather than a new source if the
construction does not create a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria of Sub-paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(I)1(ii) or (iii) but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or production equipment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Construction of a new source as defined under this Paragraph has commenced if the owner or operator has:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(II)	significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation, or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities
which is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or equipment; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities or equipment which are intended to be used
in its operation within a reasonable time.  Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without
substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation
under this Paragraph.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(j)		"Pass through" means a discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the State in quantities or concentrations which
alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources is a cause of a violation of any requirement
of the POTW's NPDES Permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration of a violation).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(k)	"Person" means any individual, corporation, company, association, partnership, county, municipality, State agency,
Federal agency or facility or other entity.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(l)		"Pretreatment" means the reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the
nature of pollutant properties in wastewater prior to or in lieu of discharging or otherwise introducing such pollutants into
a POTW.  The reduction or alteration may be obtained by physical, chemical, or biological processes, process changes
or by other means, except as prohibited by 40 CFR Part 403.6(d).  Appropriate pretreatment technology includes control
equipment, such as equalization tanks or facilities, for protection against surges or slug loadings that might interfere with
or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW.  However, where wastewater from a regulated process is mixed in an
equalization facility with unregulated wastewater or with wastewater from another regulated process, the effluent from
the equalization facility must meet an adjusted pretreatment limit calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.6(e).

<p><strong>(3)	Pretreatment Permit Requirements</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Any industrial user discharging or proposing to discharge any pollutant into a publicly owned treatment works and then
into the waters of the State, under any of the circumstances described in O.C.G.A. Section 12-5-30, shall be considered
for a pretreatment permit, with the exception of a significant industrial user, which shall obtain a permit from the EPD
to make such a discharge, unless such discharge is to a publicly owned treatment works operating under a pretreatment
program approved by the Director.  In addition to other pretreatment permit requirements described in this Paragraph,
the permit must contain the following conditions:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Statement of non-transferability without, at a minimum, prior notification to the POTW and the Director and provision
of a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Upon a finding that an industrial user meeting the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)3, 4, or 5 has no
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or
requirement, the EPD (in cases where the industrial user is directly regulated by the EPD pretreatment program) or the
POTW pretreatment program (in cases where the industrial user is directly regulated by the POTW pretreatment program)
may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial user or from a POTW
pretreatment program and in accordance with Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(d) determine that such industrial user is
not a significant industrial user.
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>(4)	Degree of Pretreatment Required.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	All pollutants discharged from an industrial user to a publicly owned treatment works and then into the waters of the
State shall receive such pretreatment or corrective action so as to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of
the issued pretreatment permit and with the following whenever applicable:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Limitations, prohibitions and pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated by the EPA pursuant to Section 307
of the Federal Act and as described in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.08(3)(a)2.

<p>2.		Until such time as such limitations, prohibitions and pretreatment standards and requirements are formally promulgated
pursuant to Section 307 of the Federal Act, the EPD shall apply such limitations, prohibitions and pretreatment standards
necessary to achieve the purposes of said Section of the Federal Act.  With respect to industrial users, such limitations,
prohibitions or pretreatment standards shall be based upon an assessment of technology and processes, to wit:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		to existing industrial users limitations or pretreatment standards and requirements based on application of the best
demonstrated control technology currently available;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	to any industrial user whose construction commences after the effective date of this Paragraph, pretreatment standards
and requirements which reflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the EPD determines to be achievable
through the application of best demonstrated control technology currently available, or changes in processes or operating
methods or other alternatives including where practical, a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Notwithstanding the above, more stringent pretreatment may be required as deemed necessary by the EPD to meet:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		any other existing Federal laws or regulations;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	to ensure compliance with any applicable State water quality standards, POTW effluent limitations, local discharge
limitations, general and specific prohibitions, dilution prohibition as specified in 40 CFR 403.6(d), pretreatment standards

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Terms and conditions under which the discharge will be permitted will be specified on the permit issued for the industrial
user to discharge into the publicly owned treatment works and then into the waters of the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	No pretreatment permit shall be issued authorizing the discharge into a publicly owned treatment works and then into
the waters of the State of any radiological, chemical or biological warfare agent or high-level radioactive waste.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Schedule of compliance:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Any person who obtains a pretreatment permit pursuant to the Act but who is not in compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and limitations or other requirements contained in such permit at the time same is issued, shall
be required to achieve compliance with such pretreatment standards and limitations or other requirements in accordance
with the schedule of compliance as set forth in such permit, or in the absence of a schedule of compliance, by the date
set forth in such permit which the Director has determined to be the shortest, reasonable period of time necessary to
achieve compliance.  Such compliance schedules may not extend the compliance date beyond applicable Federal
deadlines.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion
of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards and limitations.  No increment referred to in this Sub-Paragraph shall exceed
nine months.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Within fourteen (14) days after an interim date of compliance or the final date of compliance specified for an industrial
user, the industrial user shall provide the Director with written notice of his compliance, or non-compliance with the
requirements and conditions specified to be completed by such date.  Failure to submit the written notice is just cause
for the EPD to pursue enforcement action pursuant to the Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		An industrial user who fails or refuses to comply with an interim or final date of compliance specified in a pretreatment
permit may be deemed by the Director to be in violation of the permit and may be subject to enforcement action pursuant
to the Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.		Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or in the case of
a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, industrial users subject to
categorical standards shall submit to the Director a report containing information described in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4)-(6).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	Monitoring, recording and reporting requirements:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Any discharge to a publicly owned treatment works and then into the waters of the State authorized by a pretreatment
permit issued pursuant to the Act may be subject to such monitoring, recording and reporting requirements as may be
reasonably required by the Director including the installation, use and maintenance of monitoring equipment or methods;
specific requirements for recording of monitoring activities and results; and periodic reporting of monitoring results.  The
monitoring, record keeping, sampling, notification and reporting requirements including an identification of the pollutants
to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type, based on the applicable general pretreatment
requirements in 40 CFR Part 403, categorical pretreatment standards and applicable local limits and requirements shall
be specified in a permit when issued, provided however the Director may modify or require additional monitoring,
recording and reporting by written notification to the industrial user.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		The industrial user shall be required to retain any records of monitoring activities and results for a minimum of three (3)
years, unless otherwise required or extended by the Director upon written notification.  The period of retention shall be
extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Any holder of a permit which requires monitoring of the authorized discharge into a publicly owned treatment works and
then into the waters of the State shall report periodically to the EPD results of all required monitoring activities on
appropriate forms supplied by the EPD.  The EPD shall notify the industrial user of the frequency of reporting but in no
case shall the reporting frequency be less than twice per year during the months of June and December.  All reporting
shall be in accordance with the requirements described in 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1)-(3).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.   	The effluent limitations specified in the pretreatment permit will be based on an allowable POTW headworks loading
methodology for deriving the value of the limiting pollutant for inclusion in the permit after consideration of State water
quality standards, sludge disposal requirements, final determination of NPDES Permit limits, POTW inhibition, and any
other applicable criteria.  The limiting factor selected will then be compared to appropriate categorical standards if
applicable, and the most stringent will then be incorporated into the permit.  In instances where the potable water
sources or other incoming water sources have values that exceed limits based on water quality standards, then an
alternate limit may be derived on a case-by-case basis after the EPD's evaluation of sampling conducted on the water
sources.  These alternate effluent limitations will be considered local limits and will be enforced to comply with 40 CFR
403.5(c) and (d) requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(9)	Modification, Suspension and Revocation of Pretreatment Permits:</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	The Director may revise or modify the schedule of compliance set forth in an issued pretreatment permit if the industrial
user requests such modification or revision in writing and such modification or revision will not cause an interim date in
the compliance schedule to be extended more than one hundred and twenty (120) days or affect the final date in the
compliance schedule.  If the industrial user requests in writing the modification or revision of a schedule of compliance
set forth in an issued pretreatment permit which, if granted, would cause an interim date in the compliance schedule to
be extended more than one hundred and twenty (120) days or affect the final date in compliance schedule, the Director
may revise or modify such schedule of compliance provided it is in accordance with promulgated Federal regulations. 
The Director may grant requests in accordance with the Sub-Paragraph if he determines after documented showing by
the industrial user that good and valid cause, including acts of God, strikes, floods, material shortages or other events
over which the industrial user has little or no control, exists for such revision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b) 	The Director may modify, suspend or revoke an issued pretreatment permit in whole or in part during its term for cause,
including, but not limited to, failure or refusal of the industrial user to carry out the requirements of the Act or regulations

<p><strong><strong>391-3-6-.09   Requirements for Approval and Implementation of Publicly Owned Treatment Works Pretreatment Programs and 	    Administration of the EPD Pretreatment Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)</strong>	<strong>Purpose.</strong>  The purpose of Paragraph 391-3-6-.09 is to provide uniform procedures and practices to be followed for the EPD and
POTW pretreatment program requirements, the development and submission of POTW pretreatment programs for EPD review and
approval or denial and the public notification methods to be used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)</strong>	<strong>Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act unless
otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	"POTW pretreatment program" or "program" or "approved POTW pretreatment program" means a pretreatment program
administered by a POTW that meets the criteria established in 40 CFR 403.8 and 403.9 and which has been approved by the
Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	"Publicly Owned Treatment Works" or "POTW" means the city, town, county, district, association, or other public body created by
or pursuant to State law or Federal law that owns and operates a treatment works, and any sewers or other appurtenances that
convey wastewater to the treatment works.  The definition includes any devices and systems used  in the storage, treatment, recycling
and reclamation of municipal sewage or industrial waste of a liquid nature.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	"Submission" means a request to the EPD for approval of a POTW pretreatment program by a POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)	Required POTW Pretreatment Programs.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Any POTW or combination of POTWs operated by the same authority with a total design flow greater than 5 million gallons per day
(MGD) and receiving pollutants from industrial users which may pass through untreated or interfere with the operation of the POTW
or are otherwise subject to Section 307(b) or 307(c) of the Federal Act will be required to establish a POTW pretreatment program.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	The Director may require in writing that a POTW with a design flow of 5 mgd or less develop a POTW pretreatment program if he
finds that the nature or volume of the industrial influent, treatment process upsets, violations of POTW effluent limitations,
contamination of municipal sludge or other circumstances warrant a POTW pretreatment program in order to prevent interference
with the POTW or pass through of untreated pollutants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Any POTW described in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.09(3)(a) and (b) must obtain approval of its POTW pretreatment program no later
than three (3) years after the reissuance or modification of its existing NPDES permit, but in no case later than July 1, 1983.  POTWs
whose NPDES permits are modified under Section 301(h) of the Federal Act shall have a pretreatment program within less than three
(3) years as provided by 40 CFR Part 125, Subpart G.  POTWs identified after July 1, 1983 as being required to develop a POTW
pretreatment program under Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.09(3)(a) and (b) shall develop and submit such a program for approval as
soon as possible to the Director but in no case later than one (1) year after written notification from the Director of such identification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	The POTW pretreatment program shall meet the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 403.8(f) and shall be capable of being administered by
the POTW to ensure compliance by the industrial users with applicable State and Federal pretreatment standards and requirements
in order to be approved by the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	The Director may hold a public hearing in the geographical area served by any POTW which fails to comply with the Director's finding
and written directive that a POTW pretreatment program is required and a draft submission must be developed and submitted to the
EPD within sixty (60) days.  The  public hearing will be held to advise the public, the industrial users and other concerned parties
that the EPD will establish and operate the pretreatment program necessary to meet the Federal requirements as a result of the failure
of the POTW to carry out its legal responsibility.  The appropriate POTW, city or municipal officials will be requested to appear at
the public hearing to explain the reasons why they failed to comply with the Director's finding and directive.  For any public hearing
held pursuant to this Sub-Paragraph a public notice shall be provided at least forty-five (45) days in advance of the hearing date and
shall be published and circulated in accordance with Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(5)(a).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		A POTW requesting approval of a POTW pretreatment program shall develop a program submission which includes the information
set forth in 40 CFR 403.9(b) and 403.8(f).  Any other pertinent information requested by the Director as being necessary to clarify,
support or supplement the program description must also be submitted.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)	POTW Pretreatment Program Approval or Denial.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Any POTW requesting POTW pretreatment program approval shall submit to the EPD three copies of the submission described
in 40 CFR 403.9(b).  The EPD shall make a preliminary determination of whether the submission meets the requirements of 403.9(b)
and 403.8(f) or such other requirements as may be described by the EPD.  When the EPD is satisfied that a POTW pretreatment
program meets the requirements of 40 CFR 403.8(f), 403.9(b) and such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Director,
the EPD shall notify the POTW that the submission has been received and is under review and commence public notice and
evaluation activities set forth in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(5).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	When the EPD determines that the POTW pretreatment program does not meet the requirements of Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(a),
the EPD shall notify the POTW in writing as appropriate.  This notification shall include suggested revisions and modifications
necessary to bring the program into compliance with the applicable requirements.  Unless the necessary revisions and modifications
are made within the time period specified in the notification of denial, the EPD will proceed to develop and implement a pretreatment
program for the area served by the POTW in accordance with Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08 and 391-3-6-.09.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(5)	Notice and Public Participation.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Tentative Determination for POTW Pretreatment Program Approval.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		After the EPD has made a determination that a POTW pretreatment program submission meets the requirements of 40 CFR 403,

copying at the EPD offices in Atlanta during normal business hours;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	mailing to adjoining State whose waters may be affected; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)	mailing to designated 208 planning agencies; Federal and State fish, shellfish and wildlife resource agencies; upon request to other
appropriate government agencies; and to any other person or group including those on the appropriate EPD mailing list.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(6)	Notification of POTW Pretreatment Program Approval.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Notification of any final approval of a POTW pretreatment program will be forwarded to the POTW in writing including any conditions
or special requirements for compliance schedules, monitoring and reporting both for the POTW and the industrial user in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.12.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	When the POTW accepts the approval and any specific conditions or requirements that are a part of the approval notification by the
Director, procedures will be started to revise, modify and reissue the NPDES discharge permit to include the authority to operate a
POTW pretreatment program as a part of the NPDES permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(7)  	Modification of POTW Pretreatment Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)  	Either the EPD or a POTW with an approved POTW pretreatment program may initiate program modification at any time to reflect
changing conditions at the POTW.  Program modification is necessary whenever there is a significant change in the operation of
the POTW pretreatment program that differs from the information in the POTW submission as approved by the Director.  Any
approved POTW pretreatment program identified by the EPD that needs to modify its program to incorporate requirements that have
resulted from revisions to Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08 through 391-3-6-.10 or any other applicable paragraph revision shall develop and
submit to the EPD for approval such program modification no later than one (1) year after written notification from the EPD to modify
the program.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	POTW pretreatment program modifications shall be accomplished as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		For substantial modifications as defined in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(c):

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>(ii)	the Director shall approve or disapprove the modifications based on the requirements of 40 CFR 403.8(f), following the procedures in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(4)-(6);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	the modification shall be incorporated into the POTW NPDES permit after approval.  The permit will be modified to incorporate the
approved modification in accordance with 40 CFR 122.63(g);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	the modification shall become effective upon approval by the Director.  Notice of approval shall be published in the same newspaper
as the notice of original request for approval of the modification under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(5)(a)1(iii).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.   	The POTW shall notify the EPD of any other (i.e.,nonsubstantial) modifications to its pretreatment program at least thirty (30) days
prior to when they are to be implemented by the POTW, in a statement similar to that provided for in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(b)1(I).  Such nonsubstantial program modifications shall be deemed to be approved by the Director, unless the EPD
determines that a modification submitted is in fact a substantial modification ninety (90) days after the submission of the POTWs
statement.  Following such approval by the Director, such modifications shall be incorporated into the POTW's NPDES Permit in
accordance with 40 CFR 122.63(g).  If the EPD determines that a modification reported by a POTW in its statement is in fact a
substantial modification, the EPD shall notify the POTW and initiate the procedures in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7(b)1.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Substantial modifications.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		The following are substantial modifications for purposes of this Sub-Paragraph:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		changes to the POTW's legal authorities;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	changes to local limits;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	changes to the POTW's control mechanism as described in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	changes to the POTW's method for implementing categorical pretreatment standards;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)	a decrease in the frequency of self-monitoring or reporting required of industrial users;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vi) 	a decrease in the frequency of industrial user inspections or sampling by the POTW;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vii)	changes to the POTW's confidentiality procedures;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(viii)	significant reductions in the POTW's pretreatment program resources (including personnel commitments, equipment, and funding
levels); or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ix)	changes in the POTW's sludge disposal and management practices.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		The Director may designate other specific modifications in addition to those listed in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(c)1 as substantial
modifications.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		A modification that is not included in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(c)1 is none the less a substantial modification for purposes of
this Sub-Paragraph if the modification:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		would have a significant impact on the operation of the POTW's pretreatment program;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	would result in an increase in pollutant loadings at the POTW; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	would result in less stringent requirements being imposed on industrial users of the POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	The POTW shall prepare a list of its industrial users meeting the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)1 and 2.  The list shall
identify the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)1 and 2 applicable to each industrial user and, for industrial users meeting
the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)3, 4, or 5, shall also indicate whether the POTW has made a determination pursuant
to Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.08(3)(b) that such industrial user should not be considered a significant industrial user.  This list, and
any subsequent modifications thereto, shall be submitted to the EPD as a nonsubstantial program modification pursuant to Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(b)2.  Discretionary designations or de-designations by the POTW pretreatment program shall be deemed
to be approved by the EPD ninety (90) days after submission of the list or modifications thereto, unless the EPD determines that a
modification is in fact a substantial modification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(8)	Compliance Monitoring and Reporting Requirements for POTW Pretreatment Programs and the EPD Pretreatment
Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Both the EPD and each POTW pretreatment program shall develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with the
requirements of a pretreatment program.  At a minimum, these procedures shall enable the EPD and the POTW to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Identify and locate all possible industrial users which might be subject to the pretreatment program;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Identify the character and volume of pollutants contributed to the POTW by the industrial users identified under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(8)(a)1;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Notify industrial users identified under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(8)(a)1 of applicable pretreatment standards and any applicable
pretreatment requirements under Sections 204(b) and 405 of the Federal Act and Subtitles C and D of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act.  Notify each significant industrial user of its status as such and of all requirements applicable to it as a result of
such status;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.		Receive and analyze self-monitoring reports and other notices submitted by industrial users in accordance with the self-monitoring
requirements in 40 CFR 403.12;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.		Randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent
of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards.  Inspect and
sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>6.		Evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each such significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges based
on the requirements in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v) and require such plans when appropriate;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7.		Investigate instances of noncompliance with pretreatment standards and requirements, as indicated in the reports and notices
required under 40 CFR 403.12 or indicated by analysis, inspection, and surveillance activities.  Sample taking and analysis and the

procedures shall include provision for at least annual public notification, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality
in which the POTW is located, of industrial users which, at any time during the previous twelve months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements as defined under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.08(2)(q); and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>9.		Deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, to the POTW by industrial users where such contributions do not meet
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
Permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Both the EPD pretreatment program and each POTW pretreatment program shall require the following industrial user reports and
notifications for their regulated industrial users:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Notice of potential problems including slug loading as described in 40 CFR 403.12(f);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Report on the monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance as described in 40 CFR 403.12(g)(1)-(5);

<p>(e)	The EPD may require a POTW pretreatment program to sample and analyze the POTW influent, effluent and/or sludge for the toxic
priority pollutants as listed under Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(I)(ii) and (iii) and any other identified pollutants at a frequency
that adequately characterizes pollutant loading at the POTW.  In addition, the POTW pretreatment program may be required to
conduct biomonitoring of the POTW effluent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(9)	Legal Authority Requirements for POTW Pretreatment Programs.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall operate pursuant to a legal authority enforceable in Federal, State or local courts, which
authorizes or enables the POTW to apply and to enforce the requirements of sections 307 (b) and (c), and 402(b)(8) of the Federal
Act and any regulations implementing those sections.  Such authority may be contained in a statute, ordinance, or series of contracts
or joint powers agreements which the POTW is authorized to enact, enter into or implement and which are authorized by the Act. 
At a minimum, this legal authority shall enable the POTW to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Require compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements by industrial users;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Control through permit, order, or similar means, the contribution to the POTW by each industrial user to ensure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.  In the case of industrial users identified as significant under Sub-Paragraph
391-3-6-.08(2)(p), this control shall be achieved through permits or equivalent individual control mechanisms issued to each such
user, be enforceable and contain the minimum conditions described in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii).  Each pretreatment permit will include,
where appropriate, conditions and limits which ensure that concentration and mass limit requirements under 40 CFR 403.6(c)(1)-(7),
dilution prohibition requirements under 40 CFR 403.6(d) and combined wastestream formula requirements under 40 CFR
403.6(e)(1)-(4) are complied with;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Require the development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for the installation of technology required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial
users as are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements, including
but not limited to the reports required in 40 CFR 403.12;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.		Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to determine, independent of information supplied by
industrial users, compliance or noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements by industrial users. 
Representatives of the POTW shall be authorized to enter any premises of any industrial user in which a discharge source or
treatment system is located or in which records are required to be kept under 40 CFR 403.12(o) to assure compliance with
pretreatment standards.  Such authority shall be at least as extensive as the authority provided under Section 308 of the Federal Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.		Obtain remedies for noncompliance by any industrial user with any pretreatment standard and requirement.  All POTW's shall be
able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements.  All POTWs shall
also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000 a day for each violation by industrial
users of pretreatment standards and requirements.  Pretreatment requirements which will be enforced through the remedies set forth
in this Sub-Paragraph will include but not be limited to, the duty to allow or carry out inspections, entry, or monitoring activities; any
rules, regulations or orders issued by the POTW; any requirements set forth in individual control mechanisms issued by the POTW;
or any reporting requirements imposed by the POTW or these regulations.  The POTW shall have authority and procedures (after
informal notice to the discharger) to immediately and effectively halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW which
reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.  The POTW shall also have authority
and procedures (which shall include notice to the affected industrial users and an opportunity to respond) to halt or prevent an
endangerment to the environment or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>6.		Comply with the confidentiality requirements set forth in 40 CFR 403.14.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall develop and implement an enforcement response plan which contains detailed procedures
indicating how a POTW will investigate and respond to instances of industrial user noncompliance.  The plan shall be developed in
accordance with requirements described in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall ensure that industrial users comply with the deadline for compliance with categorical
standards as described in 40 CFR 403.6(b) or take appropriate enforcement action to address noncompliance with 40 CFR 403.6(b)
through the enforcement response plan under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(9)(b).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall ensure that proper legal authority exists to require industrial user compliance with the
general prohibitions under 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1), the specific prohibitions under 40 CFR 403.5(b)(1)-(8) and local limits under 40 CFR
403.5(c) and (d).  Each POTW developing a POTW pretreatment program pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8 shall develop and enforce
specific limits as described under 40 CFR 403.5(c) and (d) to implement the prohibitions listed in 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1) and 40 CFR
403.5(b)(1)-(8).  Each POTW pretreatment program shall continue to develop these limits as necessary and effectively enforce such
limits.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(10)	POTW Pretreatment Program Annual Report.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall provide the EPD with a report that describes POTW program activities including activities
of all participating agencies if more than one jurisdiction is involved in the local program.  The report required by this Sub-Paragraph
shall be submitted no later than one year after approval of the POTW's pretreatment program and at least annually thereafter and
shall include, at a minimum, the information required in 40 CFR 403.12(I).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(11)	Director Oversight Authority of POTW Pretreatment Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	The Director retains the authority to enforce all pretreatment standards (including categorical standards, prohibited discharge
standards, and local limits as described in 40 CFR 403) in cases where the EPD determines that insufficient enforcement action
has been taken by the POTW pretreatment program against industrial users.  The Director also has the legal authority to review self-monitoring reports submitted by the industrial user as described in 403.10(f)(1)(ii) and to carry out inspection surveillance, and
monitoring procedures as described in 403.10(f)(1)(iii).  The Director also has the legal authority to obtain remedies for
noncompliance as described in 403.8(f)(1)(vi).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(12)</strong>	<strong>Enforcement.</strong>  Any person who violates any provision of the Act, any rule promulgated and adopted pursuant thereto, or any term,
condition, schedule or compliance or other requirements contained in a permit issued pursuant to the Act shall be subject to

<p><strong>391-3-6-.10  Determinations of Categorization of Industrial Users and Requests for Fundamentally Different Factors Variances.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)</strong>	<strong>	Purpose.</strong>  The purpose of Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10 is to provide for uniform procedures and practices to be followed for the
determination of categorization of industrial users and requests for variances for fundamentally different factors.  Such
determinations will be applicable to the approved local POTW pretreatment programs and the pretreatment programs supervised
and operated by the EPD.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)		Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act unless
otherwise defined in the Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)	</strong>	<strong>Determinations on Categorization of Industrial Users.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of a pretreatment standard for a sub-category under which an industrial user believes
itself to be included, the industrial user or POTW may request that the Director provide written certification to the effect that the
industrial user does or does not fall within that particular category.  If an existing industrial user adds or changes a process or
operation which may be included in a sub-category, the existing industrial user must request this certification prior to commencing
discharge from the added or changed process or operation.  A new source must request this certification prior to commencing
discharge.  Where a request for certification is submitted by a POTW, that POTW shall notify any affected industrial user of such
submission.  The industrial user may provide written comments on the POTW submission to the EPD within thirty (30) days of
notification.  Each request shall contain a statement:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Describing which sub-categories might be applicable;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Citing evidence and reasons why a particular sub-category is applicable and why others are not applicable.  Each statement shall
contain a certification stating that the facts contained therein are true on the basis of the applicant's personal knowledge or to the best
of his information and belief.  The certification shall be attested to by a notary public and be specifically as written in 40 CFR
403.6(a)(2)(ii).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		The Director will act only on written requests for determinations that contain all of the information required.  Persons who have made
incomplete submissions will be notified by the Director that their requests are deficient and unless the time period is extended they
will be given thirty (30) days to correct the deficiency.  If the deficiency is not corrected within thirty (30) days or within an extended
period allowed by the Director the request for a determination shall be denied.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		When the Director determines that all of the information required by this Sub-Paragraph, any additional evidence that may have
been requested and any other available information relevant to the request has been submitted, he will make a written determination
of the applicable sub-category and state the reasons for his determination.  The Director shall forward the written determination
described in this Sub-Paragraph to the Regional Administrator of EPA in accordance with 40 CFR 124.62(e)(1) who may make
a final determination.  If the Regional Administrator does not modify the Director's decision within sixty (60) days after receipt
thereof, the Director's decision is final.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		The Director shall send a copy of his determination to the affected industrial user and POTW.  When the final determination is
made by the Regional Administrator of EPA, he shall send a copy of his determination to the Director and the Director will forward
it to the affected industrial user and POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		If an industrial user fails to seek the certification referred to in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10(3) within the prescribed thirty (30) day
period or to contest a negative determination through administrative channels provided, they will be bound by a subsequent
determination made by the Director as to the sub-category under which an industrial user should be included.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)		Fundamentally Different Factors Variances.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Requests for a variance from categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors and supporting evidence must
be submitted in writing to the Director within ninety (90) days after promulgation by the EPA of the categorical pretreatment
standards.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.			Written submissions for variance requests submitted to the Director must include:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)			the name and address of the person making the request;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		identification of the interest of the requestor which is affected by the categorical pretreatment standard for which the variance is
requested;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)		identification of the POTW currently receiving the waste from the industrial user for which alternative discharge limits are requested;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)		identification of the categorical pretreatment standards which are applicable to the industrial user;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)		a list of each pollutant or pollutant parameter for which an alternative discharge limit is  sought;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vi)		the alternative discharge limits proposed by the requestor for each pollutant or pollutant parameter identified in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10(4)(a)1(v);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vii)		a description of the industrial user's existing water pollution control facilities;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(viii)		a schematic flow representation of the industrial user's water system including water supply processed wastewater systems, and
points of discharge; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ix)		a statement of facts clearly establishing why the variance requests should be approved, including detailed support data,
documentation, and evidence necessary to fully evaluate the merits of the request, including technical and economic data collected
by the EPA and used in developing each pollutant discharge limit in the pretreatment standard.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		The Director will only act on written requests for variances that contain all of the information required.  Persons who have made
incomplete submissions will be notified by the Director that their requests are deficient and unless the time period is extended, will
be given thirty (30) days to correct the deficiency.  If the deficiency is not corrected within the thirty (30) days or within an extended
period allowed by the Director, the request for variance shall be denied.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		When the Director receives a submittal from a person making a request, he will, after determining that it contains all of the
information required by Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10(4)(a), consider the submission, any additional evidence that may have been
requested, and any other available information relevant to the request.  The Director will then make a written finding indicating
whether or not there are factors which are fundamentally different for that industrial user, from those factors considered in the
development of the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards.  This preliminary finding will include the reasons as to whether
or not the variance should be granted.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		When the Director finds that fundamentally different factors do not exist, he may deny the request and notify the requestor and the
industrial user, where they are not the same, of the denial.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		When the Director finds that fundamentally different factors do exist, he shall forward the request and a written recommendation
that the request be approved to the Regional Administrator of EPA.  If upon review of the recommended approval submitted by the
Director, the Regional Administrator of EPA finds that fundamentally different factors do exist and that a partial or full variance is
justified, he will approve the variance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		A request for a variance based upon fundamentally different factors shall be approved only if the applicable criteria are met as
described in 40 CFR 403.13(c).  A review of each request shall be made based upon factors considered fundamentally different as
described in 40 CFR 403.13(d) and factors which will not be considered fundamentally different as described in 40 CFR 403.13(e).

<p><strong>391-3-6-.11  Land Disposal and Permit Requirements</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)	Purpose</strong>.  The purpose of this Paragraph 391-3-6-.11 is to provide for the degree of pollutant treatment required and
the uniform procedures and practices to be followed relating to the application for and the issuance or revocation of
permits for the discharge of pollutants into land disposal or land treatment systems and then into the waters of the
State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)	Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the
Act unless otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	"Act" means the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, as amended;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	"Land disposal system" means any method of disposing of pollutants in which the pollutants are applied to the surface
or beneath the surface of a parcel of land and which results in the pollutants percolating, infiltrating, or being absorbed
into the soil and then into the waters of the State.  Land disposal systems exclude landfills and sanitary landfills but
include ponds, basins, or lagoons used for disposal of wastes or wastewaters, where evaporation and/or percolation
of the wastes or wastewaters are used or intended to be used to prevent point discharge of pollutants into waters of
the State.  Septic tank systems, as defined in Chapter 270-5-25.01 and as approved by appropriate County Boards of
Public Health, are not considered land disposal systems for purposes of Chapter  391-3-6-.11.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	"Land treatment system" means any land disposal system in which vegetation on the site is used to remove some of
the pollutants applied;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	"Treatment requirement" means any restriction or prohibition established under the Act on quantities, rates, or
concentrations, or a combination thereof, of chemical, physical, biological, or other constituents which are discharged
into a land disposal or land treatment system and then into the waters of the State, including but not limited to
schedules of compliance;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	"Land disposal system permit application" means an application filed by any person with the Director for a land disposal
system permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)	"Land disposal system permit" means any permit issued by the Division to regulate the discharge of any pollutant into
a land disposal or land treatment system;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(g)	"Hydraulic loading rate" is the rate at which wastes or wastewaters are discharged to a land disposal or land treatment
system, expressed in volume per unit area per unit time or depth of water per unit area per unit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)</strong>	<strong>Land Disposal System Permit Requirement.</strong>  Any person discharging or proposing to discharge domestic, municipal,
commercial, or industrial wastes or wastewaters into a land disposal or land treatment system and then into the waters
of the State, under any of the circumstances described in Section 10 of the Act, shall obtain a permit from the Division
to make such a discharge.  Owners of land disposal or land treatment systems which employ overland flow, subsurface
drain fields, or other techniques which result in one or more point discharges into surface waters of the State, must
obtain an NPDES permit and will not be issued a land disposal system permit.  The provisions of Section 39-3-6-.08
regarding pretreatment apply to publicly owned treatment works which employ land disposal or land treatment systems.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)</strong>	<strong>Degree of Pollutant Treatment Required.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	All pollutants discharged into land disposal or land treatment system shall receive such treatment or corrective action
so as to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the issued land disposal system permit.  The Division has
the authority to establish the degree of treatment required before the pollutant is discharged to a land disposal or a land
treatment system and then into waters of the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Any pollutants which are being discharged or are intended to be discharged to a land disposal or land treatment system
in amounts or concentrations which could be toxic or otherwise harmful to humans or biota if those pollutants mingle
with waters of the State, or in amounts or concentrations which could reduce or impair the usefulness or operation of
the land disposal or land treatment system, must receive such treatment as the Division may specify prior to being
discharged to the land disposal or land treatment system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	The hydraulic loading rate for any land disposal or land treatment system shall be determined based upon a technical
analysis of soils and vegetation in the system area, climatic data characteristics of the wastes to be disposed or treated,
and previous experience with similar systems.  Hydraulic loading rates may not exceed those established in guidelines
issued by the Division unless such technical analysis proves to the satisfaction of the Division that higher rates can be
used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	No land disposal system permit shall be issued authorizing the discharge of any radiological, chemical, or biological
warfare agent or high-level radioactive waste into a land disposal or land treatment system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	The groundwater leaving the land disposal systems boundaries must not exceed maximum contaminant levels for
drinking water in accordance with Chapter 391-3-5 and subsequent amendments.

monitoring equipment or methods, including monitoring wells; specific requirements for recording of monitoring
activities and results; and periodic reporting of monitoring results.  The monitoring, recording and reporting requirements
shall be specified in a permit when issued, provided, however, the Director may modify or require additional monitoring,
recording and reporting by written notification to the permittee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	The permittee shall be required to retain any records of monitoring activities and results for a minimum of three (3)
years, unless otherwise required or extended by the Director upon written notification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Any holder of a permit which requires monitoring of the authorized pollutant discharge into a land disposal or land
treatment system and then into the waters of the State shall report periodically to the Division results of all required
monitoring activities on appropriate forms supplied by the Division.  The Division shall notify the permittee of the
frequency of reporting but in no case shall the reporting frequency be less than once per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	The Director may revise or modify the schedule of compliance set forth in an issued land disposal system permit if the
permittee requests such modification or revision in writing.  The Director may grant requests in accordance with this
subparagraph if he determines after a documented showing by the permittee that good and valid cause (including acts
of God, strikes, floods, material shortages or other events over which the permittee has little or no control) exists for
such revision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	The Director may modify, suspend or terminate an issued land disposal system permit in whole or in part during its term
for cause, including, but not limited to, failure or refusal of the permittee to carry out the requirements of the Act or
regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and if within 30 days following receipt of such notice of such proposed
modification, suspension or termination from the Director there is no objection by the permittee in writing.  Prior to any
such modification, suspension or termination of an issued land disposal system permit by the Director (other than
modification or revision of compliance schedule pursuant to subparagraph (a) above or modification of the monitoring,
recording or reporting requirements), the Director will provide public notice in accordance with the procedures set forth
in subparagraph 391-3-6.11 (6)(b) and an opportunity for public hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth

<p>(a)	Any land disposal system permit issued under Section 10 of the Act shall have a fixed term not to exceed five years. 
Upon expiration of such permit a new permit may be issued by the Director, provided that an application for renewal
is filed with the Director at least 180 days prior to the expiration date of the existing permit.  The issuance of such new
permit shall likewise have a fixed term not to exceed five years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	A permit may be transferred to another person by a permittee if:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	The permittee notifies the Director of the proposed transfer;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	A written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility and coverage between the current
and new permittees (including acknowledgment that the existing permittee is liable for violations up to that date, and
that the new permittee is liable for violations from that date on) is submitted to the Director; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	The Director within thirty (30) days does not notify the current permittee and the new permittee of the Division's intent
to modify, revoke and reissue, or terminate the permit and to require that new application be filed rather than agreeing
to the transfer of the permit.  A new application will be required when the change of ownership is accompanied by a
change or proposed change in process or wastewater characteristics or a change or a potential change in any
circumstances that the Director believes will affect the conditions or restrictions in the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(12)</strong>	<strong>Enforcement.</strong>  Any person who violates any provision of the Act, any rule promulgated and adopted pursuant thereto,
or any term, condition, schedule of compliance or other requirement contained in a permit issued pursuant to the Act
shall be subject to enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Act.

<p>2.	The total dissolved solids (TDS) is greater than 3,000 milligrams per liter; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	It cannot now and will not in the future serve as a source of drinking water because:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	it is mineral, hydrocarbon or geothermal energy producing or can be demonstrated by a permit applicant for a Class II or III operation
to contain minerals or hydrocarbons, that considering their quantity and location, are expected to be commercially producible based on
available information; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	it is situated at a depth or location which makes recovery of water for drinking water purposes economically or technologically impractical;
or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	it is so contaminated that it would be economically or technologically impractical to render the water fit for human consumption; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	it is located over a Class III mining area subject to subsidence or catastrophic collapse.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	For Class III wells, the Director shall require an applicant for a permit which necessitates an aquifer exemption to furnish the data
necessary to demonstrate that the aquifer is expected to be mineral or hydrocarbon producing.  Information contained in the mining plan
for the proposed project, such as a map and general description of the mining zone, general information on the mineralogy and
geochemistry of the mining zone, analysis of the amenability of the mining zone to the proposed mining method and a timetable of
planned development of the mining zone shall be considered by the Director in addition to the information required by Rule 391-3-6-.13(6).  Approval of the aquifer exemption shall be treated as a program revision under this paragraph.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	For a Class II well to be used for enhanced oil recovery processes in a field or project containing aquifers from which hydrocarbons were
previously produced, commercial productibility shall be presumed by the Director upon a demonstration by the applicant of historical
production having occurred in the project area or field.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	For Class II wells not located in a field or project containing aquifers from which hydrocarbons were previously produced, information
such as logs, core data, formation description, formation depth, formation thickness and formation parameters such as permeability and
porosity shall be considered by the Director, to the extent such information is available.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	No designation of an exempted aquifer shall be final until the  Director has provided public notice and opportunity for a public hearing
on the proposed designation and the designation has been approved by the Administrator.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(5)	Prohibition of Movement of Fluid into Underground Sources of Drinking Water.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	No owner or operator shall construct, operate, maintain, convert, plug, abandon, or conduct any other injection activity in a manner that
allows the movement of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water, if the presence of that contaminant
may cause a violation of any primary drinking water regulation under Georgia's Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Chapter 391-3-5, or may
otherwise adversely affect the health of persons.  The applicant for a permit shall have the burden of showing that the requirements of
this paragraph are met.

with Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 144.4, 40 C.F.R. 144.51 and 40 C.F.R. 144.52, Rule 391-3-6-.13(9) of this Chapter and as may
be additionally required by the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	No Injection Well Permit shall be issued authorizing the movement of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of
drinking water if the presence of that contaminant may cause a violation of any primary drinking water regulation set forth in Georgia
Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Chapter 391-3-5, or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons. The applicant for a permit shall
have the burden of showing that the requirement of this paragraph is met.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	When the corrective action plan as required in Paragraph 391-3-6-.13(9) is adequate, the Director shall incorporate it into the permit as
a condition.  Where the Director's review of an application indicates that the permittee's plan is inadequate (based on the factors in
Federal Regulations 40, C.F.R. 146.07), the Director shall require the applicant to revise the plan, prescribe a plan for corrective action
as a condition of the permit under paragraph (b) of this section, or deny the application.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	No owner or operator of a new injection well may begin injection until all required corrective action has been taken.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	The Director may require as a permit condition that injection pressure be so limited that pressure in the injection zone does not exceed
hydrostatic pressure at the site of any improperly completed or abandoned well within the area of review.  This pressure limitation shall
satisfy the corrective action requirement.  Alternatively, such injection pressure limitation can be part of a compliance schedule and last
until all other required corrective action has been taken.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	When setting corrective action requirements for Class III wells the Director shall consider the overall effect of the project on the hydraulic
gradient in potentially affected underground sources of drinking water, and the corresponding changes in potentiometric surface(s) and
flow direction(s) rather than the discrete effect of each well.  If a decision is made that corrective action is not necessary based on the
determinations above, the monitoring program required in Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 146.33(b) shall be designed to verify the validity
of such determination.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	The permittee shall report any monitoring or other information which indicates any contaminant that may cause an endangerment of a
fresh water zone or underground source of drinking water or any noncompliance with a permit condition or malfunction of the injection
system which may cause fluid migration into or between fresh water zones or underground sources of drinking water.  Any
noncompliance with a permit condition or a malfunction of the injection information shall be reported by telephone to the Director within
twenty four (24) hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of the noncompliance and a written submission within five (5) days
of the oral notification.  The written submission shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause, the period of
noncompliance including exact dates and times, the corrective action taken to reduce or eliminate the noncompliance, and the steps
planned to prevent a recurrence of the noncompliance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	The permittee is required to maintain financial responsibility and resources to close, plug and abandon the underground injection
operation in a manner prescribed by the Director.  The permittee must show evidence of financial responsibility to the Director by the
submission of surety bond, or other adequate assurance, such as financial statements or other materials acceptable to the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)	The permittee shall operate the well so as not to exceed maximum injection volumes and pressures as necessary to assure that fractures
are not initiated in the confining zone; that injected fluids do not migrate into fresh water zones or underground sources of drinking water;
or that formation fluids are not displaced into underground sources of drinking water.  The Director shall establish such volumes and
pressure limits as permit conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(g)	Injection may not commence until construction is complete and written approval to commence has been given by the Director.  The
permittee shall submit notice of completion of construction to the Director including:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	All available logging and testing program data on the well;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	A demonstration of the mechanical integrity of the well;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	The anticipated maximum pressure and flow rate at which the permittee will operate;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	The results of the formation testing program;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.	The actual injection procedure;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>6.	The compatibility of injected waste with the fluids in the injection zone; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7.	The status of corrective action on defective wells in the area of review to prevent fluid movement into underground sources of drinking
water.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(h)	The permittee shall notify the Director in writing of any proposal to abandon an injection well and that the plugging and abandonment plan
approved as part of the permit will be followed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	A permit shall be issued for a period not to exceed five (5) years from the date of issuance.  On expiration of the permit the permit shall
become invalid and the injection prohibited unless application is made at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date for a reissuance
of the permit.  When a permittee has submitted a timely and sufficient application for a new Injection Well Permit and the Director is
unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue the new permit before the expiration date of the existing permit, then the Director shall
extend the existing permit until a new permit is issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(j)	A permit may be transferred to any person provided the permittee notifies the Director in writing at least 30 days in advance of the
proposed transfer date and the transfer is approved by the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(k)	The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort or any exclusive privilege.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(l)	The permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause, or minor modifications may be made in accordance with
Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 124.5, 144.39 and 144.41.  The permittee shall furnish the Director any information which the Director
may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing or terminating a permit or to determine compliance
with the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(m)	The Director may terminate a permit during its term or deny a permit renewal for the following causes:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	Noncompliance by the permittee with any conditions of the permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	The permittee's failure in the application or during the permit issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or the permittee's
misrepresentation of any relevant facts at any time;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	A determination that the permitted activity endangers human health or the environment and can only be regulated to acceptable levels
by permit modification of termination; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	A failure by the permittee to demonstrate that continuation of the operation under the permit will not result in degradation of the water
quality.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(n)	For Class I, II and III Wells, if any water quality monitoring of an underground source of drinking water indicates the movement of any
contaminant into the underground source of drinking water, the Director shall prescribe such additional requirements for construction,
corrective action, operation, monitoring or reporting (including closure of the injection well) as are necessary to prevent such movement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(o)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this rule the Director may issue a temporary permit for a specific injection in accordance with
the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 144.34.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(9)	Corrective Action.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Applicants for Class I, II, or III injection well permits shall identify the location of all known wells within the injection well's area of review
which penetrate the injection zone, or in the case of Class II wells operating over the fracture pressure of the injection formation, all known
wells within the area of review penetrating formations affected b the increase in pressure.  For such wells which are improperly sealed,
completed, or abandoned, the applicant shall also submit a plan consisting of such steps or modifications as are necessary to prevent
movement of fluid into underground sources of drinking water (corrective action).  Where the plan is adequate, the Director shall
incorporate it into the permit as a condition.  Where the Director's review of an application indicates that the permittee's plan is inadequate
(based on the factors in subparagraph 391-3-6-.13(8)(c)), the Director shall require the applicant to revise the plan, prescribe a plan for
corrective action as a condition of the permit under subparagraph (b) of this paragraph or deny the application.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	In determining the adequacy of corrective action proposed by the applicant under this paragraph and in determining the additional steps

<p><strong>391-3-6-.16  Storm Water Permit Requirements</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)</strong>	<strong>Purpose.</strong>  The purpose of this Paragraph 391-3-6-.16 is to provide for the uniform procedures and practices to be followed relating to
the application for issuance, modification, revocation and reissuance, and termination of permits for the discharge of any storm Water
into the waters of the State.  Unless specifically adopted by reference herein, no other part of this Chapter 391-3-6 shall govern the
issuance of any storm Water permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)</strong>	<strong>Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act and in 40
C.F.R. 122.26(b) unless otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	"Area Wide Permit" means either an individual or a general permit issued to a municipality or a group of municipalities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	"Associated with Industrial Activity" means any industrial activity or industrial facility identified in 40 C.F.R. 122.26(b)(14).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	"Storm Water Point Source" means a conveyance or system of conveyances (including pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels or sheet
flow which is later conveyed) primarily used for collecting and conveying storm Water runoff excluding conveyances that discharge storm
Water runoff combined with municipal sewage.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)</strong>	<strong>Permit Requirements.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Authorization to Discharge.  Storm Water point sources, as defined in this Paragraph, are point sources subject to the NPDES permit
program.  The Director may issue an NPDES permit or permits for discharges into waters of the State from a storm Water source
covering all conveyances which are part of that storm Water point source.  Where there is more than one owner or operator of a storm
Water point source, any or all discharges into that storm Water point source may be identified in the application submitted by the owner
or operator of the portion of the storm Water point source that discharges directly into waters of the State.  Any such application shall
include all information regarding discharges into the storm Water point source that would be required if the dischargers submitted
separate applications.  Dischargers so identified shall not require a separate permit unless the Director specifies otherwise.  Any permit
covering more than one owner or operator shall identify the effluent limitations, if any, which apply to each owner or operator.  Where
there is more than one owner or operator, no discharger into the storm Water point source may be subject to a permit condition for
discharges into the storm Water source other than its own discharges into that system without his consent.  All dischargers into a storm
Water point source must either be covered by an individual permit, an area wide permit or a general permit issued to the owner or operator
of that portion of the system that directly discharges into waters of the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Applicability.  The following discharges composed entirely of storm Water are required to obtain an NPDES permit for the storm Water
discharge:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	Associated with industrial activity;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	Large municipal separate storm sewer systems;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	Medium municipal separate storm sewer systems; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	Any storm Water point source that the Director determines to contribute to a violation of a Water quality standard or is a significant
contributor of pollutants to the waters of the State as provided in 40 C.F.R. 122.26.  In making this determination the Director shall
consider the following factors:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	The location of the storm Water point source with respect to waters of the State;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	The size of the storm Water point source;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	The quantity and nature of the pollutants reaching waters of the State; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	Other relevant factors.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.	Case-by-case designation of storm Water point sources. The Director may designate a conveyance or system of conveyances primarily
used for collecting and conveying storm Water runoff as a storm Water point source.  This designation may be made to the extent
allowed or required by effluent limitations guidelines for point sources in the storm Water discharge category or when a Water Quality
Management Plan under Section 208 of the Federal CWA Act which contains requirements applicable to such point sources is approved.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	General provisions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	General and area wide permits may be issued, modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated in accordance with applicable requirements
of paragraph 391-3-6-.16.  Public notice and public participation for issuance, modification, revocation and reissuance, and termination
of general permits shall be in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.16(7).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	The contents of the notice of intent shall be specified in the general permit and shall conform to the requirements specified in 40 C.F.R.
122.28.  The notice of intent shall be signed in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.16(5)(a)6.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	General permits shall specify the deadline for submitting notices of intent to be covered and the date(s) when a discharge is authorized
under the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	General permits shall specify whether a discharger that has submitted a timely notice of intent to be covered in accordance with a general
permit and that is eligible for coverage under the general permit, is authorized to discharge in accordance with the general permit either
upon receipt of the notice of intent by the Director, after a waiting period specified in the general permit, on a date specified in the general
permit, or upon receipt of notification of inclusion by the Director.  Coverage may be revoked in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.16(3)(c)(5).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.	Requiring an individual permit for storm Water discharges associated with industrial activity.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	The Director may require any person authorized by a general permit for storm Water discharges associated with industrial activity to apply
for and obtain an individual NPDES permit.  Any interested person may petition the Director to take action under this paragraph.  Cases
where an individual NPDES permit may be required include the following:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	The discharge(s) is a significant contributor of pollution as determined by the Director.  In making this determination, the Director may
consider the following factors:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(1)	The location of the discharge with respect to the waters of the State;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)	The size of the discharge;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(3)	The quantity and nature of the pollutants discharged to waters of the State; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(4)	Other relevant factors.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(II)	The discharger is not in compliance with the conditions of the general permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(III)	A change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement of pollutants applicable
to the point source;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(IV)	Effluent limitation guidelines are promulgated for point sources covered by the general  permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(V)	A Water Quality Management Plan containing requirements applicable to such point sources is approved; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(VI)	Circumstances have changed since the time of the request to be covered so that the discharger is no longer appropriately controlled
under the general permit, or either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge is necessary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	Any owner or operator authorized by a general permit may request to be excluded from the coverage of the general permit by applying
for an individual NPDES permit.  The owner or operator shall submit an application under subparagraph 391-3-6-.06(5), with reasons
supporting the request, to the Director .

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	When an individual NPDES permit is issued to an owner or operator otherwise subject to a general permit, the applicability of the general
permit to the individual NPDES permittee is automatically terminated on the effective date of the individual NPDES permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	A source excluded from a general permit solely because it already has an individual NPDES permit may request that the individual
NPDES permit be revoked, and that it be covered by the general permit.  Upon revocation of the individual NPDES permit, the general
permit shall apply to the source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)	Whenever the Director decides an individual NPDES permit is required, the Director shall notify the discharger in writing of the decision
and the reasons for it, and shall send an application form with the notice.  The discharger must apply for a permit under subparagraph
391-3-6-.06(5) and 40 C.F.R. 122.21 within sixty (60) days of notice unless a later date is granted by the Director.  Public notice and
public participation shall be in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.06(7).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)	Degree of Waste Treatment Required.</strong>  All pollutants shall receive such treatment or corrective action so as to ensure compliance with
the terms and conditions of the issued permit and with the following, whenever applicable:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Criteria and standards for Best Management Practices established by EPA pursuant to Section 304(e) of the Federal  Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Notwithstanding the above, more stringent effluent limitations may be required as deemed necessary by the Division (a) to meet any other
existing Federal laws or regulations, or (b) to ensure compliance with any applicable State Water quality standards, effluent limitations,
treatment standards, or schedules of compliance;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	Calculations and specification of effluent limits and standards shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Federal Regulations,
40 CFR 122.44(k) and 122.45; provided, however, that in regard to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(2), the feasibility of establishing numeric effluent
limitations shall be made by the Director based upon best professional judgement.

permit and the Director is unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue the new permit before the expiration date of the existing
permit, then the Director shall extend the existing permit until a new permit is issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)	For those industrial categories for which EPA will establish effluent limitations based on best available technology, permits will be issued

and subsequent regulations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(g)	Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) above, if a toxic effluent standard or prohibition (including any schedule of compliance specified in
such effluent standard or prohibition) is established under Section 307(a) of the Act for a toxic pollutant which is present in a discharge
and such standard prohibition is more stringent than any limitation for such pollutant in a permit, the permit shall be revised or modified
in accordance with the toxic effluent standard or prohibition and the permittee so notified.

<p>O.C.G.A. Sections 12-5-520 thru 12-5-525 requires the director
to develop river basin plans for specific rivers including the
Chattahoochee, Coosa, Flint and the Ocmulgee. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>O.C.G.A. Section 12-7 et. seq. requires a comprehensive
statewide soil erosion and sedimentation control program to
protect and conserve air, land, and water resources through the
adoption and implementation of local ordinances and programs
which regulate certain land disturbing activities generally
associated with urban development. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>House Bill 1788 requires the Board to establish turbidity
standards. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>Senate Bill 500 (ACT 1042) requires specific sanctions against
Atlanta for failure to meet phosphorus standards, establishes new
phosphorous limits for the Chattahoochee River, establishes
specific schedules and sanctions for CSO's for Atlanta. It also
requires certain assessments of water quality by the director
prior to the issuance of any permits for river basin transfer for
wastewater disposal and allows a 10% reduction in permit capacity
for a permit violation during July 1, 1996 to July 1, 1997. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>OC.G.A. Section 43-51 et. seq. requires that all operators of
water treatment, water distribution, wastewater treatment and
wastewater collection facilities obtain a certificate from the
state. It also requires that all analysts that perform tests, as
defined by the Board, in conjunction with the operation with a
water treatment or wastewater treatment plant, obtain a
certificate from the state. This section also delegates
classification of plants to EPD and allows EPD to require
certification in permits which EPD issues. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>O.C.G.A. Section 1205 et.seq. requires that all direct
discharges of wastewater to a stream or to a land disposal site
obtain a permit from the division; requires permits for certain
indirect dischargers to municipal sewer systems; requires the
division to establish water quality standards, lake water quality
standards, and water use classifications; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>House Bill 228 authorizes the department to adopt technical
and procedural rules governing sludge land application systems. <br

<p>To conduct intensive surveys and trend monitoring of Georgia's surface waters, conduct water quality modeling and develop 
wasteload allocations, carry out river basin management planning, conduct aquatic toxicity testing, and implement the urban, 
agricultural, and commercial forestry nonpoint source programs as a part of the overall Water Protection Branch nonpoint 
source pollution control program. </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=center><a name="objectives">OBJECTIVES</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>To conduct intensive surveys on streams, lakes, and estuaries. Stream surveys will be conducted to provide specific 
information for mathematical models; impact studies will be conducted to collect information concerning special problem 
areas; document water quality conditions, and investigate nonpoint source problems.</li>
<li>To operate the Georgia trend monitoring network and use the EPA STORET system to manage trend monitoring data.</li>
<li>To build, calibrate, and verify mathematical water quality models and to develop critical period models for wasteload 
allocations and the analysis of other water quality management issues.</li>
<li>To prepare and assign, based on water quality modeling efforts, wasteload allocations as requested for new or 
expanding municipal or industrial facilities, or in response to needs associated with NPDES permit issuance.</li>
<li>To conduct river basin management planning as resources are available in accordance with Senate Bill 637 passed by 
the Georgia General Assembly in 1992.</li>
<li>To conduct acute and chronic toxicity tests on facility effluents to address whole effluent toxicity and to provide 
information for permitting decisions. Also to conduct tests on stream samples in support of intensive surveys.</li>
<li>To coordinate and manage Section 319 Nonpoint Source Pollution Control grant funds (partially matched by Georgia) 
for urban, forestry, agriculture, adopt-a-stream, and education projects.</li>
<li>To overview and support voluntary, non-regulatory nonpoint source control programs conducted by the Georgia Soil 
and Water Conservation Committee (agricultural nonpoint source issues), the Georgia Forestry Commission (forestry 
nonpoint source issues), and develop urban programs for the control of nonpoint source pollutants.</li>
<li>To conduct monitoring of water quality at major public access lakes in Georgia to document water quality conditions 
and trophic status. To increase emphasis as resources are available on assessment of major publicly owned lakes (1000 
acres or greater) and development of standards in accordance with Senate Bill 714 passed in 1990.</li>
<li>To coordinate and manage Section 314 Clean Lakes Grants provided to Georgia by the USEPA. Phase I 
Diagnostic/Feasibility projects are underway on Lakes West Point, Lanier, Allatoona, Walter F. George, and 
Blackshear. Georgia is also conducting a fish tissue evaluation project on major publicly owned lakes using Clean Lakes 
Assessment funds provided by the USEPA and matched in part by the State of Georgia.</li>
<li>To review and update the Georgia Continuing Planning Process (CPP) as appropriate.</li>
<li>To coordinate the review and research on water quality standards issues for the Water Protection Branch.</li>
<li>To support other programs within the Division by providing water quality related environmental data and technical 
assistance for the completion of work described elsewhere in this Implementation Plan. Reviews of proposed water 
effects ratio study plans and reports by industries are examples of this technical assistance.</li>
<li>To refine the data gathering resources within the Division to insure future information needs are met. Computerized data 
collection, desktop geographic mapping systems, and fish tissue assessment procedures are examples of expanded data 
gathering and handling methods developed in recent years.</li>
<li>To examine and develop analytical modeling methods necessary to solve current problems and to address those issues 
anticipated in the future. An example of this will be the work on a dynamic model of the Chattahoochee River from 
Buford Dam to Franklin to be continued in FY 1995.</li>

<h3 align="center"><a name="background">Background</a></h3>

<p>The State of Georgia established an integrated water pollution
control program in 1964 with the passage of the Georgia Water
Quality Control Act. The 1964 Act created a Water Quality Control
Board and a Division for Water Quality Control with the authority
to investigate water pollution problems and take action to insure
documented problems were cleaned up. The Division for Water
Quality Control became the cornerstone of the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division (EPD) which was created in
1972.</p>

<p>The Water Protection Branch of the EPD has maintained the
integrated approach to water quality and manages specific aspects
of water pollution control including; stream, lake and estuarine
monitoring; water quality modeling; river basin management
planning; establishing water quality standards; nonpoint source
management; administration of the federal construction grants and
State revolving loan process for funding municipal water
pollution control plant construction; the permitting, compliance
and enforcement program for municipal and industrial.</p>

<p>We are fortunate in Georgia to have a good supply of clean
water. Programs implemented by local governments, industry, farmers,
foresters, and individuals have helped to control water
pollution. Improvements in wastewater treatment by local governments
and industry have made a significant contribution to improving
water quality in our rivers and streams over the past twenty
years. <pr> However, many significant water quality challenges
remain, including the difficulty of controlling stormwater runoff
from urban and agricultural lands. Another issue of concern is
soil erosion and subsequent sedimentation which occurs whenever
we disturb the earth and fail to properly implement effective
erosion/sediment control measures.</p>

<p>We must also face the challenge of conducting long-term
planning to protect our water resources and to project future
water supply needs in order to promote plans and conservation
practices to provide clean water for all future uses. </p>

<p>The Water Protection Branch uses an annual program plan or
Fiscal Year Clean Water Implementation Plan which is designed to
detail goals and objectives for the fiscal year. The fiscal year
Clean Water Implementation Plan is drafted in June, provided to
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the public for
review, and implemented at the beginning of the federal fiscal
year on October 1. </p>

<hr>

<h3 align="center"><a name="LAuthority">Legal Authority</a></h3>

<p>The Georgia Water Quality Control Act, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder provide adequate authority
to establish and maintain a comprehensive State water protection
program.</p>

<p>During the past twenty years it has been adequately
demonstrated that the Georgia Water Quality Control Act and the adopted
rules and regulations provide strong and effective legal
authority for the State program.</p>

<p>The Georgia Water Quality Control Act, as amended, provides
legal authority comparable to Section 504 of the federal Clean
Water Act as amended. Contingency plans are available to
implement the &quot;emergency authority&quot; of the State Act on
a case by case basis as needed. This meets the requirements of
Section 106 of the federal Clean Water Act as amended.</p>

<hr>

<h3 align="center"><a name="RBMP">Georgia River Basin Management
Planning</a></h3>

<p>Georgia has adopted a river basin management planning (RBMP)
approach to watershed protection as defined in State law (O.C.G.A.
12-5-520) passed by the Georgia General Assembly in 1992. The law
designated the Chattahoochee, Flint, Coosa, and Oconee Rivers as
the first basins to be addressed. The law requires each plan
include a description of the basin or watershed, identification
of local governments in each basin, land use inventories, and a
description of plan goals which may include providing
environmental education, improving water quality, reducing
pollution at the source, improving aquatic habitat,
reestablishing native species of fish, restoring and protecting
wildlife habitat, and providing recreational benefits. A description
of the strategies and measures necessary to accomplish the goals
is also to be a part of each management plan. The law also
requires a seven person local advisory committee be appointed to
provide advice and council to GAEPD during the plan development.</p>

<p>A watershed protection approach will provide a tool for the
assessment and prioritization of water resource issues, development
of solutions, and opportunities for targeted, cooperative actions
to reduce pollution and enhance aquatic habitat. The watershed
approach will provide opportunities for participation by many
stakeholders, and the solutions implemented will draw on the
combined experiences and resources of many stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>RBMP represents a new approach to water resources management
for the State of Georgia that focuses on the watershed, rather
than state-wide program specific approaches. It is not a new
regulatory program, but rather a new way of applying existing
regulatory programs. Water supply and surface/groundwater quality
issues will be addressed in an integrated manner. Stakeholder
involvement will be emphasized throughout the planning and
implementation process.</p>

<p>Partnerships will be developed to share plan development and
implementation opportunities. Similar watershed protection approaches
are becoming a national initiative of varying scales ranging from
small individual watersheds to large interstate watersheds.</p>

necessary uses and to maintain and improve the biological integrity of the waters of the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		Those waters in the State whose existing quality is better than the minimum levels established in standards on the date standards
become effective will be maintained at high quality; with the State having the power to authorize new developments, when it has been
affirmatively demonstrated to the State that a change is justifiable to provide necessary social or economic development; and
provided further that the level of treatment required is the highest and best practicable under existing technology to protect existing
beneficial water uses. Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the existing uses shall be
maintained and protected.  All requirements in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 131.12, will be achieved before lowering of water
quality is allowed for high quality water.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		Outstanding National Resource Waters (ONRW).  This designation will be considered for an outstanding national resource waters,
such as waters of National or State parks and wildlife refuges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance.

stream flow conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		Applicable State and Federal requirements and regulations for the discharge of radioactive substances shall be met at all times.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		The dissolved oxygen criteria as specified in individual water use classifications shall be applicable at a depth of one meter below
the water surface; in those instances where depth is less than two meters, the dissolved oxygen criterion shall be applied at a mid-depth.  On a case specific basis, alternative depths may be specified.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(6)		Specific Criteria for Classified Water Usage</strong>.  In addition to the general criteria, the following criteria are deemed necessary and
shall be required for the specific water usage as shown:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Drinking Water Supplies:<strong>  </strong>Those waters approved as a source for public drinking water systems permitted or to be permitted by
the Environmental Protection Division.  Waters classified for drinking water supplies will also support the fishing use and any other
use requiring water of a lower quality.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		Bacteria:  For the months of May through October, when water contact recreation activities are expected to occur, fecal coliform
not to exceed a geometric mean of 200 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours. Should water quality and sanitary studies show fecal coliform levels from non-human
sources exceed 200/100 ml (geometric mean) occasionally, then the allowable geometric mean fecal  coliform shall not exceed 300
per 100 ml in lakes and reservoirs and 500 per 100 ml in free flowing freshwater streams.  For the months of November through
April, fecal coliform not to exceed a geometric mean of 1,000 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given
sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours and not to exceed a maximum of 4,000 per 100 ml for any
sample.  The State does not encourage swimming in surface waters since a number of factors which are beyond the control of any
State regulatory agency contribute to elevated levels of fecal coliform.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		Dissolved oxygen:  A daily average of 6.0 mg/l and no less than 5.0 mg/l at all times for waters designated as trout streams by the
Wildlife Resources Division.  A daily average of 5.0 mg/l and no less than 4.0 mg/l at all times for water supporting warm water
species of fish.

contaminant level established for that substance by the Environmental Protection Division pursuant to the Georgia Rules for Safe
Drinking Water.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)		Temperature:  Not to exceed 90<sup></sup>F.  At no time is the temperature of the receiving waters to be increased more than 5<sup></sup>F above intake
temperature except that in estuarine waters the increase will not be more than 1.5<sup></sup>F.  In streams designated as primary trout or
smallmouth bass waters by the Wildlife Resources Division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures.  In streams
designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding 2<sup></sup>F of natural stream temperatures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		Recreation:  General recreational activities such as water skiing, boating, and swimming, or for any other use requiring water of
a lower quality, such as recreational fishing. These criteria are not to be interpreted as encouraging water contact sports in proximity
to sewage or industrial waste discharges regardless of treatment requirements:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		Bacteria:  Fecal coliform not to exceed the following geometric means based on at least four samples collected from a given
sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(1)		Coastal waters	100 per 100 ml

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)		All other recreational waters   200 per 100 ml

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(3)		Should water quality and sanitary studies show natural fecal coliform levels exceed 200/100 ml (geometric mean) occasionally in
high quality recreational waters, then the allowable geometric mean fecal coliform level shall not exceed 300 per 100 ml in lakes
and reservoirs and 500 per 100 ml in free flowing fresh water streams.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		Dissolved Oxygen:  A daily average of 6.0 mg/l and no less than 5.0 mg/l at all times for waters designated as trout streams by the
Wildlife Resources Division.  A daily average of 5.0 mg/l and no less than 4.0 mg/l at all times for waters supporting warm water

<p>(iii)		pH:  Within the range of 6.0 - 8.5.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)		Temperature:  Not to exceed 90F.  At no time is the temperature of the receiving waters to be increased more than 5F above
intake temperature except that in estuarine waters the increase will not be more than 1.5<sup></sup>F.  In streams designated as primary trout
or smallmouth bass waters by the Wildlife Resources Division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures.  In
streams designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding 2F natural stream temperatures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		Fishing:  Propagation of Fish, Shellfish, Game and Other Aquatic Life; secondary contact recreation in and on the water; or for any
other use requiring water of a lower quality:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		Dissolved Oxygen:  A daily average of 6.0 mg/l and no less than 5.0 mg/l at all times for water designated as trout streams by the
Wildlife Resources Division.  A daily average  of 5.0 mg/l and no less than 4.0 mg/l at all times for waters supporting warm water
species of fish.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		pH:  Within the range of 6.0 - 8.5.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)		Bacteria:  For the months of May through October, when water contact recreation activities are expected to occur, fecal coliform
not to exceed a geometric mean of 200 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours. Should water quality and sanitary studies show fecal coliform levels from non-human
sources exceed 200/100 ml (geometric mean) occasionally, then the allowable geometric mean fecal coliform shall not exceed 300
per 100 ml in lakes and reservoirs and 500 per 100 ml in free flowing freshwater streams.  For the months of November through
April, fecal coliform not to exceed a geometric mean of 1,000 per 100 ml based on at least four samples collected from a given
sampling site over a 30-day period at intervals not less than 24 hours and not to exceed a maximum of 4,000 per 100 ml for any
sample.  The State does not encourage swimming in surface waters since a number of factors which are beyond the control of any
State regulatory agency contribute to elevated levels of fecal coliform. For waters designated as approved shellfish harvesting
waters by the appropriate State agencies, the requirements will be consistent with those established by the State and Federal
agencies responsible for the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The requirements are found in the National Shellfish Sanitation
Program Manual of Operation, Revised 1988, Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, U. S.  Department of Health and Human
Services (PHS/FDA), and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  Streams designated as generally supporting shellfish
are listed in Paragraph 391-3-6-.03(14).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)		Temperature:  Not to exceed 90<sup></sup>F.  At no time is the temperature of the receiving waters to be increased more than 5<sup></sup>F above intake
temperature except that in estuarine waters the increase will not be more than 1.5F.  In streams designated as primary trout or
smallmouth bass waters by the Wildlife Resources Division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures.  In streams
designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding 2<sup></sup>F natural stream temperatures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		Wild River:  For all waters designated in 391-3-6-.03(13) as "Wild River," there shall be no alteration of natural water quality from
any source.

<p>	

<p>(e)		Scenic River:  For all waters designated in 391-3-6-.03(13) as "Scenic River," there shall be no alteration of natural water quality
from any source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		Coastal Fishing:  This classification will be applicable to specific sites when so designated by the Environmental Protection Division. 
For waters designated as "Coastal Fishing", site specific criteria for dissolved oxygen will be assigned and detailed by footnote in
Section 391-3-6-.03(3), "Specific Water  Use Classifications." All other criteria and uses for the fishing use classification will apply
for coastal fishing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong> (7)</strong>	<strong>	Natural Water Quality</strong>.  It is recognized that certain natural waters of the State may have a quality that will not be within the general
or specific requirements contained herein. This is especially the case for the criteria for dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and
fecal coliform.  NPDES permits and best management practices will be the primary mechanisms for ensuring that discharges will
not create a harmful situation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong> (8)</strong>		<strong>Treatment Requirements</strong>.  Notwithstanding the above criteria, the requirements of the State relating to secondary or equivalent
treatment of all waste shall prevail.  The adoption of these criteria shall in no way preempt the treatment requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong> (9)</strong>		<strong>Streamflows</strong>.  Specific criteria or standards set for the various parameters apply to all flows on regulated streams. On unregulated
streams, they shall apply to all streamflows equal to or exceeding the 7-day, 10-year minimum flow (7Q10). All references to 7-day,
10-year minimum flow (7Q10) also apply to all flows on regulated streams.  All references to annual average stream flow also apply
to long-term average stream flow conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(10) 	Mixing Zone</strong>.  Effluents released to streams or impounded waters shall be fully and homogeneously dispersed and mixed insofar
as practical with the main flow or water body by appropriate methods at the discharge point.  Use of a reasonable and limited mixing
zone may be permitted on receipt of satisfactory evidence that such a zone is necessary and that it will not create an objectionable
or damaging pollution condition. Protection from acute toxicity shall be provided within any EPD designated mixing zone to ensure
a zone of safe passage for aquatic organisms.  The procedure is as described in paragraph 391-3-6-.06(4)(d)(5)(vi), except that
the numerical pass/fail criteria applies to the end-of-pipe without the benefit of dilution provided by the receiving stream.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(11)</strong> <strong>	Toxic Pollutant Monitoring</strong>.  The Division will monitor waters of the State for the presence or impact of Section 307 (a)(l) Federal
Clean Water Act toxic pollutants<strong>,</strong> and other priority pollutants.  The monitoring shall consist of the collection and assessment of
chemical and/or biological data as appropriate from the water column, from stream bed sediments, and/or from fish tissue.  Specific
stream segments and chemical constituents for monitoring shall be determined by the Director on the basis of the potential for water
quality impacts from toxic pollutants from point or nonpoint waste sources.  Singularly or in combination, these constituents may
cause an adverse effect on fish propagation at levels lower than the criteria.  Instream concentrations will be as described in 391-3-6-.03 (5)(d).  Additional toxic substances and priority pollutants will be monitored on a case specific basis using Section 304(a)
Federal Clean Water Act guidelines or other scientifically appropriate documents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(12)</strong>	<strong>	Fecal Coliform Criteria</strong>.  The criteria for fecal coliform bacteria provide the regulatory framework to support the USEPA
requirement that States protect all waters for the use of primary contact recreation or swimming.  This is a worthy national goal,
although potentially unrealistic with the current indicator organism, fecal coliform bacteria, in use today.  To assure that waters are
safe for swimming indicates a need to test waters for pathogenic bacteria.  However, analyses for pathogenic bacteria are expensive
and results are generally difficult to reproduce quantitatively.  Also, to ensure the water is safe for swimming would require a whole
suite of tests be done for organisms such as <u>Salmonella</u>, <u>Shigella</u>, <u>Vibrio</u>, etc. as the presence/absence of one organism would
not document the presence/absence of another.  This type of testing program is not possible due to resource constraints.  The
environmental community in the United States has based the assessment of the bacteriological quality of water on testing for
pathogenic indicator organisms, principally the coliform group.  The assessment of streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries in Georgia
and other States is based on fecal coliform organisms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Coliform bacteria live in the intestinal tract of warm blooded animals including man.  These organisms are excreted in extremely
high numbers, averaging about 1.5 billion coliform per ounce of human feces.  Pathogenic bacteria also originate in the fecal
material of diseased persons.  Therefore, waters with high levels of fecal coliform bacteria represent potential problem areas for
swimming.  However, there is no positive scientific evidence correlating elevated fecal coliform counts with transmission of enteric
diseases.  In addition, these bacteria can originate from any warm blooded animal or from the soil.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Monitoring programs have documented fecal coliform levels in excess of the criteria in many streams and rivers in urban areas,
agricultural areas, and even in areas not extensively impacted by man such as national forest areas.  This is not a unique situation
to Georgia as similar levels of fecal coliform bacteria have been documented in streams across the nation.  The problem appears
to lie in the lack of an organism which specifically indicates the presence of human waste materials which can be correlated to
human illness.  Other organisms such as the Enterococci group and <u>E. coli</u> have been suggested by the USEPA as indicator
organisms.  However, testing using these organisms by States and the USEPA has indicated similar problems with these indicator
organisms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		The Environmental Protection Division will conduct a monitoring project from 1993 through 1995 to evaluate the use of <u>E. coli</u> and
Enterococci as indicators of bacteriological quality in Georgia.  The Environmental Protection Division will also conduct studies to
determine if a better human specific indicator can be found to replace current indicator organisms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(13)</strong>		<strong>Specific Water Use Classifications</strong>.  Beneficial water uses assigned by the State to all surface waters.  These classifications are scientifically determined to be the best utilization of the surface water from an environmental and economic
standpoint.  Streams and stream reaches not specifically listed are classified as Fishing.  The specific classifications are
as follows:

<p><strong><strong>391-3-6-.06  Waste Treatment and Permit Requirements.  Amended.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(1)	Purpose.  </strong>The purpose of this Paragraph 391-3-6-.06 is to provide for the degree of waste treatment required and the uniform
procedures and practices to be followed relating to the application for issuance, modification, revocation and reissuance, and
termination of permits for the discharge of any pollutant into the waters of the State.  Requirements applicable to general NPDES
permits are provided in subparagraphs 391-3-6-.15 and 391-3-6-.16.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(2)	Definitions</strong>.  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act unless
otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)	"Annual average stream flow" means that flow measured daily at the nearest listed U.S. Geologic Survey stream gauge, averaged
for the entire period of record, and adjusted by comparison to the size of the drainage area in which the discharge is located.

<p>	

<p>	(b)	"Aquaculture project" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R.  122.25;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)	"Concentrated animal feeding operation" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40
C.F.R.  122.23;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)	"Concentrated aquatic animal production facility" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal
Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.24;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)	"Construction" means any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment (including contractual obligations to
purchase such facilities or equipment) at the premises where such equipment will be used, including preparation work at such
premises;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(f)	"Dilution factor" means a numerical representation of the dilution of the permitted effluent from the wastewater treatment facility
in the receiving stream.  It shall be used to calculate instream concentrations of priority pollutants when the effluent concentration
is known and to calculate effluent limitations from the instream criteria concentration listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.	For constituents listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(I) and (ii), the dilution factor equals:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		<u>7-day, 10-year minimum stream flow (7Q10) + discharger design flow</u>

<p>		                   discharger design flow

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		For constituents listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(iii), the dilution factor equals:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>		Annual or long-term average stream flow + discharger design flow</u>

<p>		                  discharger design flow

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.	The dilution factor equations assume a relatively rapid and complex mix.  In situations where this does not occur, the Permittee or
EPD may perform field studies to document and describe the mixing zone.  The dilution factor in such situations, for the purpose
of calculating effluent limitations for chemical constituents, will be determined based on the studies. If a mixing zone is granted,
all criteria and requirements of subsection 391-3-6-.03(10) must also be met.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.	In situations where the dilution factor equations do not appropriately describe the dilution capacity of receiving waters, such as for
discharges to impounded waters or to tidal estuaries, the dilution factor will be determined through field studies or appropriate
analytical procedures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(g)	"Effluent Limitation" means any restriction or prohibition established under the Act on quantities, rates, or concentrations, or a
combination thereof, of chemical, physical, biological, or other constituents which are discharged from point sources into the waters
of the State, including, but not limited to, schedules of compliance and whole effluent biological monitoring requirements;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(h)	"EPD" means the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources;

<p>	(I)	"Indirect discharger" means a non-domestic discharger introducing pollutants to a publicly owned treatment works;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(j)	"Major discharger" as defined in EPA annual operating guidance for the EPA Regional Offices and the States and specifically listed
in the annual State program plan;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(k)	"New discharger" means any point source that meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.29;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(l)	"New Source" means any point source that meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.29;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(m)	"NPDES Permit Application" means the application filed by any person with the Director for an NPDES Permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(n)	"NPDES Permit" means the permit issued by the Division to regulate the discharge of pollutants from any point source into the
waters of the State;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(o)	"Segment" means a portion of a water quality planning area, the surface waters of which have common hydrologic characteristics
(or flow regulation patterns); common natural physical, chemical and biological characteristics and processes; and common
reactions to external stresses, such as the discharge of pollutants.  Segments will be classified as either a water quality segment
or an effluent limitation segment as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 1.	Water quality segment.  Any segment where it is known that water quality does not meet applicable water quality standards and/or
is not expected to meet applicable water quality standards even after the application of the effluent limitations required by sections
301(b)(1)(B) and 301(b)(2)(A) of the Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 2.	Effluent limitation segment.  Any segment where it is known that water quality is meeting and will continue to meet applicable water
quality standards or where there is adequate demonstration that water quality will meet applicable water quality standards after the
application of the effluent limitations required by sections 301(b)(1)(B) and 301(b)(2)(A) of the Act."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(p)	"Separate storm sewer" means any point source which meets the criteria set forth in the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R.  122.26.

<p>	<strong>(3)	Permit Requirement.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)	Any person discharging or proposing to discharge into the waters of the State any pollutant from a point source including those
defined in Paragraph 391-3-6-.06(2) above, under any of the circumstances described in O.C.G.A. Section 12-5-30(a), shall obtain
a permit from the EPD to make such discharge.<u></u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)	Any person discharging or proposing to discharge any pollutant from a non-point source into the waters of the State, under the
circumstances described in O.C.G.A. Section 12-5-30(b), shall obtain written approval from the EPD and shall be required to use
best management practices to minimize to the extent feasible as determined by the EPD the introduction of the pollutant into the
waters of the State.  The best management practices shall be included in a permit, if the Director has issued one to the same
person for a point source discharge.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)	Any person owning or operating a treatment works, from which a discharge into the waters of the State could possibly occur,
excluding discharges which could result from Acts of God, shall apply to the EPD for a permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(4)	Degree of Waste Treatment Required.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>(ii)		For the chemical constituents identified after completion of (I) above, and/or if other site specific information available to the EPD
indicates the presence of one or more of the above chemical constituents at levels of concern to EPD, the EPD will control the
chemical constituent in the NPDES permit with a monitoring provision or an effluent limit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		If the instream concentration, which is measured or calculated by dividing the effluent concentration by the appropriate dilution
factor from 391-3-6-.06(2)(f), is greater than the criteria concentration, then the permit will contain a monitoring requirement for
that constituent.  However, if the data requirements in 391-3-6-.06(4)(d)(5)(ii)(b) are met and the results indicate that a chemical
constituent's instream concentration is fifty percent or more of the instream standard, an effluent limit for that constituent will be
required at permit issuance, as below.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		The permit will provide that, after the permittee has monitored the chemical constituents for one year, the EPD will review the
monitoring results.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(1)		If the results of at least ten monthly samples indicate that a chemical constituent's instream concentration is less than fifty percent
of the instream standard, based on the formula in 391-3-6-.06(2)(f), then the EPD may terminate or lessen the monitoring
requirement for that constituent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)		If the results of at least ten monthly samples indicate that a chemical constituent's instream concentration is fifty percent or more
of the instream standard, the permit shall be modified to include an effluent limit for the chemical constituent calculated as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Effluent limit = criteria concentration x dilution factor

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		If the permit is issued or modified as in (ii)(b)(2) above for a chemical constituent listed in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(ii), the limit shall
become effective upon issuance or modification of the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		At the request of the permittee, a schedule to allow for development of a site-specific effluent limit may be established by the EPD. 
This schedule would be contained in an accompanying Administrative Order and include the following:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(1)		A requirement for monthly monitoring for all chemical constituents that are limited.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)		A requirement that the permittee perform site-specific studies, consisting of whole effluent biomonitoring, water-effect ratio tests,
stream studies, or other appropriate studies or calculations.  The methodology for these tests will be determined by the EPD on
a case-by-case basis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(3)		A requirement that all data obtained in (2) and (3) be submitted to the EPD for review.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(4)		No more than two years following initiation of monitoring under (ii)(a), the EPD will use the data to calculate site-specific limitations
for each chemical constituent, and will initiate the process to incorporate the limitation(s) into the permit along with requirements
for a minimum of annual whole effluent biomonitoring.  At any time during the two year period the EPD may, upon its initiative or
that of the permittee, review the data that have been submitted and may determine that limits and monitoring requirements for one
or more chemical constituents may be terminated.  All modifications of limits and monitoring requirements will comply with
anti-backsliding requirements contained in Section 402(o) of the Clean Water Act.  Conversely, should the EPD determine that
adequate data are available before the two year interim monitoring period, it may develop site specific limitations for the
constituent(s) without additional monitoring.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		Any permit modifications or revocation/reissuances pursuant to (ii)(b)(2) or (ii)(d) will be performed in accordance with procedures
described in 391-3-6-.06(7), including public participation requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		For any metals monitored during any portion of the limits determination process, measurement will be by the most appropriate
analytical technique approved by the U.S. EPA which provides a measurement of the portion of the metal present which may
cause toxicity to aquatic life in the receiving stream.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> (iii)		For other 307(a) chemical constituents, including priority pollutants not identified in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(I)-(v) whole effluent
biomonitoring will be used to develop either a site-specific criteria concentration or a whole effluent toxicity limit, with such limits

<p>	(iv)		The criteria concentration may be more stringent under either one of the following situations:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		If the chemical constituent exists in the upstream reaches of the receiving stream at any level greater than zero due to the presence
of other direct dischargers.  For this situation, the criteria concentration for computation of the effluent limit will be the net value
after subtracting out this initial concentration.  Unless actual water quality studies and monitoring or calculations indicate otherwise,
it will be assumed that the upstream levels of each constituent are zero; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		If the EPD determines that more stringent limitations should be imposed in order to reserve some assimilative capacity for future
discharges.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(v)		The effluent limit determined in (ii)(b)(2) above may be adjusted as follows, to determine the actual effluent limit to be used in the
permit:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		If the limit is more stringent than the analytical laboratory detection limit using analytical methods described in Federal Regulations
40 C.F.R. 136 or methods that have EPA concurrence, then the limit will include an accompanying statement in the permit that
a reading of not detected using the analytical methods specified in the permit will be considered as being in compliance with the
limit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		If water quality studies and monitoring indicate that the chemical constituent is present in the water supply or in the upstream
reaches of the receiving stream at a concentration equal to or exceeding the daily limit for the specific chemical constituent, and
the presence of such cannot be attributed to direct point source dischargers, or nonpoint sources that can be reasonably controlled
with best management practices, the limit will be set equal to the natural ambient concentration of the chemical constituent;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		For industrial point source dischargers, if the specific chemical constituent is regulated by a technology-based effluent  guideline
limit, the guideline limit will be compared to the calculated limit.  The limit will be the more stringent of the two values;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		For complex effluents, where several chemical constituents exist, the EPD will assign a limit for each specific chemical constituent
and may require a whole effluent biomonitoring limit where there is a reasonable potential that the narrative criteria for whole effluent
toxicity will be exceeded.  Such whole effluent biomonitoring limitation will consist of a series of bioassays of the wastewater
treatment plant effluent, and, if appropriate, toxicity source identification evaluations, and implementation steps to reduce the
chronic toxicity.  This approach shall not be applied to those chemical constituents considered potential or known carcinogens or
to the chemical constituents identified in 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(iii).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(vi)  	NPDES permits issued or reissued after the adoption of this paragraph shall include biological monitoring provisions and, where
determined by the State to be necessary, a water quality-based whole effluent provision utilizing numerical pass/fail criteria to
manage the effluent for the additive effects of all Section 307(a)(1) Federal Clean Water Act toxic pollutants and other unknown
toxic substances or priority pollutants.  The water quality-based whole effluent approach will help to ensure that the wastewater
treatment plant effluent does not contain unknown sources of acute and chronic toxicity that may interfere with the designated water
quality use classifications of the receiving stream.  The whole effluent acute biological toxicity monitoring provision ensures
protection from acute toxicity within any designated mixing zone and helps to define alternate criteria to allow for the safe passage
of aquatic organisms through streams with 7-day, 10-year minimum flows approaching zero.  The numerical pass/fail criteria is
also a screening technique for use by the EPD to determine priority toxicity reduction needs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		To all new dischargers or new sources the following shall apply:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> 	 1.		Except as provided in subparagraph (e) 2. any new discharger on which construction commenced after October 18, 1972, or any
new source, which meets the applicable promulgated new source performance standards before the commencement of discharge,
shall not be subject to any more stringent new source performance standards, or to any more stringent technology-based standards
under section 301(b)(2) of the Federal Act for the shortest of the following periods:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(I)		Ten years from the date that construction is completed;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(ii)		Ten years from the date the source begins to discharge process or other non-construction related wastewater; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	iii)		The period of depreciation or amortization of the facility for the purposes of Section 167 or 169 (or both) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Comment:  The provisions of this subparagraph do not apply to existing sources which modify their pollution control facilities or construct new
pollution control facilities and achieve performance standards, but which are neither new sources nor new dischargers or otherwise do not
meet the requirements of this subparagraph.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 2.		The protection of more stringent standards of performance afforded by subparagraph (e) 1. of this section does not apply to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(I)		Additional or more stringent permit conditions which are not technology based, e.g., conditions based on water quality standards,
or effluent standards or prohibitions under Section 307(a) of the Federal Act; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(ii)		Additional permit conditions controlling pollutants listed as toxic under Section 307(a) of the Federal Act or as hazardous
substances under Section 311 of the Federal Act and which are not controlled by new source performance standards. This
includes permit conditions controlling pollutants other than those identified as toxic or hazardous where control of those other
pollutants has been specifically identified as the method to control the toxic or hazardous pollutant.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> 	 3.		Where an NPDES permit issued to a source enjoying a "protection period" under subparagraph (e) 1. will expire on or before the
expiration of the protection period, such permit shall require the owner or operator of the source to be in compliance with the
requirements of Section 301 of the Federal Act and any other applicable requirements of the Federal Act immediately upon the
expiration of the protection period. No additional period for achieving compliance with these requirements shall be allowed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 4.		The owner or operator of a new source, a new discharger, a source recommencing discharge after terminating operations, or a
source which has been an indirect discharger which commences discharging into navigable waters shall install and have in
operating condition, and shall "startup" all pollution control equipment required to meet the terms and conditions of its permits
before beginning to discharge.  Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), the owner or operator must meet all
permit terms and conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 5.		After the effective date of new source performance standards, in accordance with Section 306(e) of the Federal Act, it shall be
unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of those standards, applicable to such
source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(<strong>5)		Application for Permit.</strong>

the Director with written notice of its compliance or non-compliance with the requirements or conditions specified to be
completed by such date.  Failure to submit the written notice is just cause for the EPD to pursue enforcement action
pursuant to the Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	On the last working day of February, May, August, and November the Director shall submit to EPA information
concerning noncompliance with NPDES Permit requirements by major dischargers in the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		Any discharger who fails or refuses to comply with an interim or final date of compliance specified in a permit may
be deemed by the Director to be in violation of the permit and may be subject to enforcement action pursuant to the
Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(11)  	Monitoring, Recording and Reporting Requirements.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			Any discharge authorized by a permit issued pursuant to the Act may be subject to such monitoring, recording and
reporting requirements as may be reasonably required by the Director including the installation, use and maintenance
of monitoring equipment or methods; specific requirements for recording of monitoring activities and results; and
periodic reporting of monitoring results.  The monitoring, recording and reporting requirements shall be specified in a
permit when issued, provided, however, the Director may require additional monitoring, recording and reporting by
written notification to the permittee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		The monitoring requirements of any discharge authorized by any such permit shall be consistent with Federal
Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.41, 122.42, and 122.44 and applicable State laws.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

by the Director upon written notification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		Any holder of a permit which requires monitoring of the authorized discharge shall report periodically to the EPD the
results of all required monitoring activities on appropriate forms supplied by the EPD.  The Director shall notify the
permittee of the frequency of reporting but in no case shall the reporting frequency be less than once per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(12) 	Modification, Revocation and Reissuance, and Termination of Permits.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		The Director may revise or modify the schedule of compliance set forth in an issued permit if the permittee requests
such modification or revision in writing and such modification or revision will not cause an interim date in the
compliance schedule to be extended more than one hundred twenty (120) days or affect the final date in the
compliance schedule.  The Director may grant requests in accordance with this subparagraph if he determines  after
documented showing by the permittee that good and valid cause (including Acts of God, strikes, floods, material
shortages or other events over which the permittee has little or no control) exists for such revision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		The Director in accordance with the provisions of Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.61, 122.62, 122.63, 122.64,

costs to modify or replace facilities construction with a grant for innovative and alternative wastewater technology
under Section 202(a)(2), the schedule of compliance may be modified to reflect the amount of time lost during
construction of the innovative or alternative facility.  In no case shall the compliance schedule be modified or extend
beyond an applicable statutory deadline for compliance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		New sources, new dischargers, sources which recommence discharging after terminating operations and those sources
which had been indirect dischargers which commence discharging directly into navigable waters do not qualify for
compliance schedules under this paragraph and are subject to Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.29(d)(4).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(13)   Non-governmentally Owned Sewerage Systems.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

for a permit.  This provision shall not be applicable to systems discharging only industrial waste.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(14)   Control of Disposal of Pollutants into Wells.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			If the permit proposes to discharge to a well or subsurface water, the Director shall specify additional terms and
conditions which shall (a) prohibit the proposed disposal, or (b) control the proposed disposal in order to prevent
pollution of ground and surface water resources and to protect the public health and welfare.  Any permit issued for
the disposal of pollutants into wells shall comply with Federal Regulations, and applicable State laws.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(15)  	Duration, Continuation and Transferability of Permits.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit issued under Section 10(3) and (4) of the Act shall have a fixed term not to exceed five (5) years.  Upon
expiration of such permit, a new permit may be issued by the Director in accordance with Section 10(6) of the Act
and Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 122.9 and 122.64 provided that an application for such new permit is filed with
the Director at least 180 days prior to the expiration date of the existing permit.  The issuance of such new permit shall
likewise have a fixed term not to exceed five (5) years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		A permit may be transferred to another person by a permittee in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 122.61 if:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 2.		A written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility and coverage between the current
and new permittees (including acknowledgment that the existing permittee is liable for violations up to that date, and
that the new permittee is liable for violations from that date on) is submitted to the Director; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	 3.		The Director within thirty (30) days does not notify the current permittee and the new permittee of the EPD's intent
to modify, revoke and reissue, or terminate the permit and to require  that a new application be filed rather than
agreeing to the transfer of the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Comment:  A new application will be required where the change of ownership is accompanied by a change or proposed change
in process or wastewater characteristics or a change or potential change in any circumstances that the Director believes will
affect the conditions or restrictions in the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		When the permittee has submitted a timely and sufficient application for a new NPDES permit and the Director is
unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue the new permit before the expiration date of the existing permit, then
the Director shall extend the existing permit until a new permit is issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		For those industrial categories for which EPA will establish effluent limitations based on best available technology,
permits will be issued to ensure compliance with the effluent limits by the statutory deadline.  This will be
accomplished by utilizing short-term permits and/or reopener clauses that will allow the permit to be modified, revoked,
reissued to comply with limitations promulgated pursuant to the Act and subsequent regulations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) above, if a toxic effluent standard or prohibition (including any schedule of
compliance specified in such effluent standard or prohibition) is established under Section 307(a) of the Act for a toxic
pollutant which is present in a discharge and such standard prohibition is more stringent than any limitation for such
pollutant in a permit, the permit shall be revised or modified in accordance with the toxic effluent standard or
prohibition and the permittee so notified.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(16) 	Enforcement.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

information is still valid and correct.

<p>	

<p>(5)		Permit Applications:  Farm Uses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Prior Uses.  A permit for the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters for farm uses shall be issued by the Director to any person
when the applicant submits an application which provides reasonable proof that the applicant's farm use of surface waters occurred
prior to July 1, 1988, and when any such application is submitted prior to July 1, 1991.  If submitted prior to July 1, 1991, an
application for a permit to be issued based upon farm uses of surface waters occurring prior to July 1, 1988, shall be granted for
the withdrawal or diversion of surface waters at a rate of withdrawal or diversion equal to the greater of the operating capacity in
place for withdrawal or diversion on July 1, 1988, or, when measured in gallons per day on a monthly average for a calendar year,
the greatest withdrawal or diversion capacity during the five-year period immediately preceding July 1, 1988.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		New Uses.  If submitted after July 1, 1991, or regardless of when submitted, if it is based upon a withdrawal or diversion of surface
waters for farm use occurring or proposed to occur on or after July 1, 1988, an application shall be subject to evaluation and
classification pursuant to subsection 391-3-6-.07(4),-.07(6) and -.07(7) of these Rules; but a permit based upon such evaluation
and classification shall be issued to ensure the applicant's right to a reasonable use of such surface waters.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		Permittees shall submit application for withdrawal or diversion of water for farm use to the Division on forms to be supplied by the

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(6)</strong>	<strong>	Combination Uses</strong>.  A combination of farm and non-farm surface water use shall be considered a non-farm surface use, unless
the director determines that the predominant use to which the water is put is farm use.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(7)</strong>	<strong>	System of Classification for Competing Permit Applications</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		In situations involving competing uses, existing or proposed, for a supply of available surface water, the Division 	shall consider:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		The number of persons using the particular water source and the object, extent and necessity of their respective withdrawals or uses;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

caused or expected to be caused to other water uses;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>9.		Diversion from or reduction of flows in other watercourses;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>10.	The prior investments of any person in lands, and plans for the farm usage of water in connection with such lands, which plans have
been submitted to the Director within a reasonable time after July 1, 1988; provided that the granting of such a permit shall not have
unreasonably adverse effects upon other water uses in the area, including potential as well as present use;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	11.		The varying circumstances of each use.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(8)</strong>	<strong>	Priorities for Competing Applications</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		When there are competing applications for water from the same source, and the source is insufficient to supply all applicants, the
following order of priorities shall prevail:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		Emergency facilities for essential life support measures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.		Domestic and personal uses, including drinking, cooking, washing, sanitary purposes and all health related activities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.		Farm uses as defined herein.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	4.		Industrial uses (including those industries on public water systems).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	6.		Outdoor recreational uses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Competing applicants or users within the above categories shall be assigned a priority rating based upon a consideration of the
facts set forth in subsection 391-3-6-.07(6) of these Rules.  In the event two or more competing applicants or users qualify equally
under the priority rating, the Director will grant permits to such competing applicants, or modify the existing permits of the users,
for use of specified quantities of surface water on a prorated or other reasonable basis in those situations where such action is
feasible, provided, however, that the Director will give preference to an existing use over an initial application.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		The Division shall take into consideration the extent to which such withdrawals, diversions or impoundments are reasonably
necessary in the judgment of the Director to meet the applicant's reasonable needs; including the needs of any third party to whom
the permit applicant was furnishing water for the processing of perishable agricultural products which require minimum quantities
of water to comply with State or federal laws or regulations, and shall grant a permit which shall meet those reasonable needs;
provided, however, that the granting of such permit shall not have unreasonable adverse affect upon other water uses in the area
including but not limited to public use, farm use, and potential as well as present use, and provide, further, however, notwithstanding
the above, that the Director shall grant a permit to any permit applicant who on the effective date of this Act has outstanding
indebtedness in the form of revenue certificates or general obligation bonds which are being amortized through the sale of surface
water, the permitted quantity of such shall be at least in an amount consistent with the quantity for which the revenue certificates
or general obligation bonds were issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(9)</strong>		<strong>Duration of Permits</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit granted for the withdrawal, diversion or impoundment of surface waters shall be for a period of time not less than ten
(10) years (unless the applicant requests a shorter period of time) nor more than twenty (20) years, except that farm use permits
shall have no term and may be transferred or assigned to subsequent owners of the lands which are the subject of such permit. 
Provided, however, that the Division shall be notified in writing by the permittee of such transfer or assignment.  The Director may
authorize a permit of duration of up to fifty (50) years in the case of a municipality or other governmental body where such period
is required to provide for the retirement of bonds for the construction of water works or waste disposal facilities;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		If requested by the applicant, the Director may issue a temporary permit for less than ten (10) years, or a letter of concurrence for
transient uses lasting less than 180 days.  Applicant's concurrence with a draft permit whose duration is less than ten (10) years
shall serve as a request for a temporary permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(10)</strong>	<strong>	Renewal of Permits</strong>.  All permittees desiring to renew a permit shall submit an application for renewal to the Director within six
(6) months prior to its expiration.  All renewals will be treated in the same manner as the initial permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(11)</strong>	<strong>	Revocation, Suspension or Modification of Permits</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit granted for the withdrawal, diversion or impoundment of surface waters may be revoked, in whole or in part, permanently
or temporarily, for the following reasons:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		Any material false statement in an application for a permit or in any report required to be made;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.		Any willful violation of a condition of a permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.		Nonuse of the water supply (or a significant portion thereof) allowed by a permit for a period of two (2) consecutive years or more,
unless the permittee can reasonably demonstrate that his nonuse was due to extreme hardship caused by factors beyond his
control; except that this paragraph will not apply to farm use permits issued after initial use has commended;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	4.		With the written consent of the permittee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Any such permit may be revoked, in whole or in part, for a period not to exceed one (1) year for violation of any provision of Section
12-5-31, et seq. of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		Any such permit may be suspended or modified if the Director should determine that the quantity of water allowed under the permit
is greater than that needed by the permittee for the particular use upon which the application for permit was based, or would prevent
other applicants from reasonable use of surface waters, including farm use;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		The director may suspend or modify a farm use permit if he should determine through inspection, investigation, or otherwise that
the quantity of water allowed under the permit would prevent other applicants from reasonable use of surface waters for farm use;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(e)		Consistent with the considerations set forth in Chapter 391-3-6-.07(7), any such permit may be revoked, suspended or modified
for any other good cause consistent with the health and safety of the citizens of this State and within the provisions of this Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(f)		In the event of modification, suspension or revocation of permit, the Director shall serve written notice of such action on the permit
holder and give the reason for such action.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(12)		Emergency Water Shortage</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Any permit may be suspended, restricted or otherwise modified by emergency order of the Director when an emergency period of
water  shortages exists.  Prior to any such action, it must clearly appear to the Director from specific facts shown by affidavits of
residents of the affected area of this State that an emergency period of water shortage exists within such area, so as to place in
jeopardy the health or safety of the citizens of such area or to threaten serious harm to the water resources of the area.  Any
permittee has five (5) days from the date of mailing of the notice of the proposed change in the permit to appear in opposition to
the proposed action.  Except as to farm uses, any change, suspension or restriction in the permit is effective immediately upon
receipt of such order by the permittee, his agent for service of process, or any agent of employee of the permittee who receives the
notification at the permittee's principal place of business in the State.  Any permittee, other than a farm use permittee, to whom such
order is directed shall comply therewith immediately;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Upon application, the permittee, including a farm use permittee, shall be afforded a hearing before a hearing officer appointed by
the Department of Natural Resources within twenty (20) days of receipt of said application by the hearing officer.  Farm use
permittees may continue to make use of water to their permitted capacity during the appeal process, but failure to timely request
a hearing in accordance with Subsection (c) of Code Section 12-2-2 shall waive such right;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		In the event of dire emergency, only water for domestic and personal uses, for drinking, cooking, washing, sanitary purposes and
all health related activities will be permitted.  Farm uses will be given second priority; however, all other usages will be established
by the Director based on the priorities established in subsection 391-3-6-.07(7). The importance and necessity of water for industrial
purposes are in no way modified or diminished by this subsection;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(d)		Upon expiration of the emergency period of water shortage, the permittee will be notified in writing of such expiration and the said
permittee may then operate under the permit as issued prior to the emergency.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(13)</strong>	<strong>	Request for Modification of Unexpired Permit</strong>.  A permittee may seek modification of any of the terms of an issued permit.  The
Director may modify such permit providing the permittee establishes at least one of the following:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		a change in conditions has resulted in a need by the permittee of more water than is allowed under the existing permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		The proposed modification would result in a more efficient use of water than is possible under the existing permit; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		A proposed change in conditions would result in a need by the permittee of more water than is allowed under the existing permit. 
Any such modification shall be consistent with the health and safety of the citizens of this State and with provisions of this Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	(14)		Interbasin Transfer Permits</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		In the consideration of applications for permits which if granted would authorize the withdrawal and transfer of surface waters
across natural basins, the Director shall be bound by the following requirements:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		The Director shall give due consideration to competing existing uses and applications for permits which would not involve interbasin
transfer of surface water and, subject to subsection 391-3-6-.07(6), shall endeavor to allocate a reasonable supply of surface waters
to such users and applicants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Public Notification

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		A press release regarding the proposed issuance of a permit for interbasin transfer of surface water shall be given to newspapers
of general circulation in the area which would be affected by such issuance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.		The press release shall be issued at least seven (7) days before issuance of the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.		If the Director determines sufficient public interest exists, he shall hold a hearing somewhere within the area affected prior to the
issuance of the permit.  The Director shall provide reasonable public notice of such meeting.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(c)		Interbasin Permits

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.		A public advisory regarding the proposed issuance of a new permit shall be provided to one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the area of the applicant.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>(15)</strong>		<strong>Records</strong>.  Except for farm use permits issued pursuant to subsection 391-3-6-.07(5), whenever required to carry out the objectives
of Section 12-5-31 et seq. of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, the Director may by order, permit or otherwise, in writing,
require any person holding a permit or any other person who the Director reasonably believes is unlawfully withdrawing, diverting
or impounding surface waters to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(a)		Establish and maintain records;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	(b)		Make reports;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	"Indirect discharge" or "discharge" means the introduction of pollutants into a POTW from any nondomestic source
regulated under Section 307(b), (c) or (d) of the Federal Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	"Industrial user" means any person discharging or proposing to discharge any pollutant into a publicly owned treatment
works and then into waters of the State and is considered a source of indirect discharge.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)	"Interference or interfere" means a discharge which, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources,
inhibits or disrupts a Publicly Owned Treatment Work's (POTW's) sewer system, treatment processes or operations or its
sludge processes, including use or disposal thereof; and such discharge is a cause of a violation of any requirement of the
POTW's NPDES Permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration of a violation).  The terms include prevention of
sewage sludge use or disposal in accordance with Section 405 of the Federal Act, or any criteria, guidelines, or regulations
developed pursuant to State or Federal water, land or air protection laws.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		"New Source" means:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Any building, structure, facility or installation from which there is or may be a discharge of pollutants, the construction
of which commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under Section 307(c) of the Federal Act
which will be applicable to such source if such standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section
provided:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		the building, structure, facility or installation is constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	the building, structure, facility or installation totally replaces the process or reduction equipment that causes the discharge
of pollutants at an existing source; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	the production or wastewater generating processes of the building, structure, facility or installation are substantially
independent of an existing source at the same site.  In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors
such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant and the extent to which the new facility

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Any industrial user discharging or proposing to discharge any pollutant into a publicly owned treatment works and then
into the waters of the State, under any of the circumstances described in O.C.G.A. Section 12-5-30, shall be considered
for a pretreatment permit, with the exception of a significant industrial user, which shall obtain a permit from the EPD
to make such a discharge, unless such discharge is to a publicly owned treatment works operating under a pretreatment
program approved by the Director.  In addition to other pretreatment permit requirements described in this Paragraph,
the permit must contain the following conditions:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Statement of non-transferability without, at a minimum, prior notification to the POTW and the Director and provision

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Upon a finding that an industrial user meeting the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)3, 4, or 5 has no
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or
requirement, the EPD (in cases where the industrial user is directly regulated by the EPD pretreatment program) or the
POTW pretreatment program (in cases where the industrial user is directly regulated by the POTW pretreatment program)
may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial user or from a POTW
pretreatment program and in accordance with Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(d) determine that such industrial user is
not a significant industrial user.
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>(4)	Degree of Pretreatment Required.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	All pollutants discharged from an industrial user to a publicly owned treatment works and then into the waters of the

pursuant to Section 307 of the Federal Act, the EPD shall apply such limitations, prohibitions and pretreatment standards
necessary to achieve the purposes of said Section of the Federal Act.  With respect to industrial users, such limitations,
prohibitions or pretreatment standards shall be based upon an assessment of technology and processes, to wit:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		to existing industrial users limitations or pretreatment standards and requirements based on application of the best
demonstrated control technology currently available;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	to any industrial user whose construction commences after the effective date of this Paragraph, pretreatment standards
and requirements which reflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the EPD determines to be achievable
through the application of best demonstrated control technology currently available, or changes in processes or operating
methods or other alternatives including where practical, a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Notwithstanding the above, more stringent pretreatment may be required as deemed necessary by the EPD to meet:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		any other existing Federal laws or regulations;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	to ensure compliance with any applicable State water quality standards, POTW effluent limitations, local discharge

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Terms and conditions under which the discharge will be permitted will be specified on the permit issued for the industrial
user to discharge into the publicly owned treatment works and then into the waters of the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	No pretreatment permit shall be issued authorizing the discharge into a publicly owned treatment works and then into
the waters of the State of any radiological, chemical or biological warfare agent or high-level radioactive waste.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Schedule of compliance:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Any person who obtains a pretreatment permit pursuant to the Act but who is not in compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and limitations or other requirements contained in such permit at the time same is issued, shall
be required to achieve compliance with such pretreatment standards and limitations or other requirements in accordance
with the schedule of compliance as set forth in such permit, or in the absence of a schedule of compliance, by the date
set forth in such permit which the Director has determined to be the shortest, reasonable period of time necessary to
achieve compliance.  Such compliance schedules may not extend the compliance date beyond applicable Federal
deadlines.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion
of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards and limitations.  No increment referred to in this Sub-Paragraph shall exceed
nine months.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Within fourteen (14) days after an interim date of compliance or the final date of compliance specified for an industrial
user, the industrial user shall provide the Director with written notice of his compliance, or non-compliance with the
requirements and conditions specified to be completed by such date.  Failure to submit the written notice is just cause
for the EPD to pursue enforcement action pursuant to the Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		An industrial user who fails or refuses to comply with an interim or final date of compliance specified in a pretreatment
permit may be deemed by the Director to be in violation of the permit and may be subject to enforcement action pursuant
to the Act.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.		Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or in the case of
a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, industrial users subject to
categorical standards shall submit to the Director a report containing information described in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4)-(6).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	Monitoring, recording and reporting requirements:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Any discharge to a publicly owned treatment works and then into the waters of the State authorized by a pretreatment
permit issued pursuant to the Act may be subject to such monitoring, recording and reporting requirements as may be
reasonably required by the Director including the installation, use and maintenance of monitoring equipment or methods;
specific requirements for recording of monitoring activities and results; and periodic reporting of monitoring results.  The
monitoring, record keeping, sampling, notification and reporting requirements including an identification of the pollutants
to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type, based on the applicable general pretreatment
requirements in 40 CFR Part 403, categorical pretreatment standards and applicable local limits and requirements shall
be specified in a permit when issued, provided however the Director may modify or require additional monitoring,
recording and reporting by written notification to the industrial user.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		The industrial user shall be required to retain any records of monitoring activities and results for a minimum of three (3)
years, unless otherwise required or extended by the Director upon written notification.  The period of retention shall be
extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Any holder of a permit which requires monitoring of the authorized discharge into a publicly owned treatment works and
then into the waters of the State shall report periodically to the EPD results of all required monitoring activities on
appropriate forms supplied by the EPD.  The EPD shall notify the industrial user of the frequency of reporting but in no
case shall the reporting frequency be less than twice per year during the months of June and December.  All reporting
shall be in accordance with the requirements described in 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1)-(3).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.   	The effluent limitations specified in the pretreatment permit will be based on an allowable POTW headworks loading
methodology for deriving the value of the limiting pollutant for inclusion in the permit after consideration of State water
quality standards, sludge disposal requirements, final determination of NPDES Permit limits, POTW inhibition, and any
other applicable criteria.  The limiting factor selected will then be compared to appropriate categorical standards if
applicable, and the most stringent will then be incorporated into the permit.  In instances where the potable water
sources or other incoming water sources have values that exceed limits based on water quality standards, then an
alternate limit may be derived on a case-by-case basis after the EPD's evaluation of sampling conducted on the water
sources.  These alternate effluent limitations will be considered local limits and will be enforced to comply with 40 CFR
403.5(c) and (d) requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(9)	Modification, Suspension and Revocation of Pretreatment Permits:</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	The Director may revise or modify the schedule of compliance set forth in an issued pretreatment permit if the industrial
user requests such modification or revision in writing and such modification or revision will not cause an interim date in
the compliance schedule to be extended more than one hundred and twenty (120) days or affect the final date in the
compliance schedule.  If the industrial user requests in writing the modification or revision of a schedule of compliance
set forth in an issued pretreatment permit which, if granted, would cause an interim date in the compliance schedule to
be extended more than one hundred and twenty (120) days or affect the final date in compliance schedule, the Director
may revise or modify such schedule of compliance provided it is in accordance with promulgated Federal regulations. 
The Director may grant requests in accordance with the Sub-Paragraph if he determines after documented showing by
the industrial user that good and valid cause, including acts of God, strikes, floods, material shortages or other events
over which the industrial user has little or no control, exists for such revision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b) 	The Director may modify, suspend or revoke an issued pretreatment permit in whole or in part during its term for cause,
including, but not limited to, failure or refusal of the industrial user to carry out the requirements of the Act or regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto and/or promulgated Federal regulations, if within thirty (30) days following receipt of such
notice of such proposed modifications, suspension or revocation from the Director there is no objection by the industrial
user in writing.   Prior to any such modifications, suspension or revocation of an issued pretreatment permit by the
Director (other than modification or revision of compliance schedule pursuant to Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.08(9)(a) above
or modification of the monitoring, recording or reporting requirements), the Director will provide public notice in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.08(7)(b).  If the industrial user files an objection

<p><strong><strong>391-3-6-.09   Requirements for Approval and Implementation of Publicly Owned Treatment Works Pretreatment Programs and 	    Administration of the EPD Pretreatment Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)</strong>	<strong>Purpose.</strong>  The purpose of Paragraph 391-3-6-.09 is to provide uniform procedures and practices to be followed for the EPD and
POTW pretreatment program requirements, the development and submission of POTW pretreatment programs for EPD review and
approval or denial and the public notification methods to be used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)</strong>	<strong>Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act unless
otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	"POTW pretreatment program" or "program" or "approved POTW pretreatment program" means a pretreatment program
administered by a POTW that meets the criteria established in 40 CFR 403.8 and 403.9 and which has been approved by the
Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	"Publicly Owned Treatment Works" or "POTW" means the city, town, county, district, association, or other public body created by
or pursuant to State law or Federal law that owns and operates a treatment works, and any sewers or other appurtenances that
convey wastewater to the treatment works.  The definition includes any devices and systems used  in the storage, treatment, recycling
and reclamation of municipal sewage or industrial waste of a liquid nature.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	"Submission" means a request to the EPD for approval of a POTW pretreatment program by a POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)	Required POTW Pretreatment Programs.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Any POTW or combination of POTWs operated by the same authority with a total design flow greater than 5 million gallons per day
(MGD) and receiving pollutants from industrial users which may pass through untreated or interfere with the operation of the POTW
or are otherwise subject to Section 307(b) or 307(c) of the Federal Act will be required to establish a POTW pretreatment program.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	The Director may require in writing that a POTW with a design flow of 5 mgd or less develop a POTW pretreatment program if he
finds that the nature or volume of the industrial influent, treatment process upsets, violations of POTW effluent limitations,
contamination of municipal sludge or other circumstances warrant a POTW pretreatment program in order to prevent interference
with the POTW or pass through of untreated pollutants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Any POTW described in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.09(3)(a) and (b) must obtain approval of its POTW pretreatment program no later
than three (3) years after the reissuance or modification of its existing NPDES permit, but in no case later than July 1, 1983.  POTWs
whose NPDES permits are modified under Section 301(h) of the Federal Act shall have a pretreatment program within less than three
(3) years as provided by 40 CFR Part 125, Subpart G.  POTWs identified after July 1, 1983 as being required to develop a POTW
pretreatment program under Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.09(3)(a) and (b) shall develop and submit such a program for approval as
soon as possible to the Director but in no case later than one (1) year after written notification from the Director of such identification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	The POTW pretreatment program shall meet the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 403.8(f) and shall be capable of being administered by
the POTW to ensure compliance by the industrial users with applicable State and Federal pretreatment standards and requirements
in order to be approved by the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	The Director may hold a public hearing in the geographical area served by any POTW which fails to comply with the Director's finding
and written directive that a POTW pretreatment program is required and a draft submission must be developed and submitted to the
EPD within sixty (60) days.  The  public hearing will be held to advise the public, the industrial users and other concerned parties
that the EPD will establish and operate the pretreatment program necessary to meet the Federal requirements as a result of the failure
of the POTW to carry out its legal responsibility.  The appropriate POTW, city or municipal officials will be requested to appear at
the public hearing to explain the reasons why they failed to comply with the Director's finding and directive.  For any public hearing
held pursuant to this Sub-Paragraph a public notice shall be provided at least forty-five (45) days in advance of the hearing date and
shall be published and circulated in accordance with Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(5)(a).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		A POTW requesting approval of a POTW pretreatment program shall develop a program submission which includes the information
set forth in 40 CFR 403.9(b) and 403.8(f).  Any other pertinent information requested by the Director as being necessary to clarify,
support or supplement the program description must also be submitted.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)	POTW Pretreatment Program Approval or Denial.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Any POTW requesting POTW pretreatment program approval shall submit to the EPD three copies of the submission described
in 40 CFR 403.9(b).  The EPD shall make a preliminary determination of whether the submission meets the requirements of 403.9(b)
and 403.8(f) or such other requirements as may be described by the EPD.  When the EPD is satisfied that a POTW pretreatment
program meets the requirements of 40 CFR 403.8(f), 403.9(b) and such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Director,
the EPD shall notify the POTW that the submission has been received and is under review and commence public notice and
evaluation activities set forth in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(5).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	When the EPD determines that the POTW pretreatment program does not meet the requirements of Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(a),
the EPD shall notify the POTW in writing as appropriate.  This notification shall include suggested revisions and modifications
necessary to bring the program into compliance with the applicable requirements.  Unless the necessary revisions and modifications
are made within the time period specified in the notification of denial, the EPD will proceed to develop and implement a pretreatment
program for the area served by the POTW in accordance with Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08 and 391-3-6-.09.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(5)	Notice and Public Participation.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Tentative Determination for POTW Pretreatment Program Approval.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		After the EPD has made a determination that a POTW pretreatment program submission meets the requirements of 40 CFR 403,

copying at the EPD offices in Atlanta during normal business hours;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	mailing to adjoining State whose waters may be affected; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)	mailing to designated 208 planning agencies; Federal and State fish, shellfish and wildlife resource agencies; upon request to other
appropriate government agencies; and to any other person or group including those on the appropriate EPD mailing list.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(6)	Notification of POTW Pretreatment Program Approval.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Notification of any final approval of a POTW pretreatment program will be forwarded to the POTW in writing including any conditions
or special requirements for compliance schedules, monitoring and reporting both for the POTW and the industrial user in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.12.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	When the POTW accepts the approval and any specific conditions or requirements that are a part of the approval notification by the
Director, procedures will be started to revise, modify and reissue the NPDES discharge permit to include the authority to operate a
POTW pretreatment program as a part of the NPDES permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(7)  	Modification of POTW Pretreatment Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)  	Either the EPD or a POTW with an approved POTW pretreatment program may initiate program modification at any time to reflect
changing conditions at the POTW.  Program modification is necessary whenever there is a significant change in the operation of
the POTW pretreatment program that differs from the information in the POTW submission as approved by the Director.  Any
approved POTW pretreatment program identified by the EPD that needs to modify its program to incorporate requirements that have
resulted from revisions to Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08 through 391-3-6-.10 or any other applicable paragraph revision shall develop and
submit to the EPD for approval such program modification no later than one (1) year after written notification from the EPD to modify
the program.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	POTW pretreatment program modifications shall be accomplished as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		For substantial modifications as defined in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(c):

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		the POTW shall submit to the EPD a statement of the basis for the desired modification, a modified program description or such
other documents the Director determines to be necessary under the circumstances;

<p>(ii)	the Director shall approve or disapprove the modifications based on the requirements of 40 CFR 403.8(f), following the procedures in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(4)-(6);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	the modification shall be incorporated into the POTW NPDES permit after approval.  The permit will be modified to incorporate the
approved modification in accordance with 40 CFR 122.63(g);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	the modification shall become effective upon approval by the Director.  Notice of approval shall be published in the same newspaper
as the notice of original request for approval of the modification under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(5)(a)1(iii).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.   	The POTW shall notify the EPD of any other (i.e.,nonsubstantial) modifications to its pretreatment program at least thirty (30) days
prior to when they are to be implemented by the POTW, in a statement similar to that provided for in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(b)1(I).  Such nonsubstantial program modifications shall be deemed to be approved by the Director, unless the EPD
determines that a modification submitted is in fact a substantial modification ninety (90) days after the submission of the POTWs
statement.  Following such approval by the Director, such modifications shall be incorporated into the POTW's NPDES Permit in
accordance with 40 CFR 122.63(g).  If the EPD determines that a modification reported by a POTW in its statement is in fact a
substantial modification, the EPD shall notify the POTW and initiate the procedures in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7(b)1.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Substantial modifications.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		The following are substantial modifications for purposes of this Sub-Paragraph:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		changes to the POTW's legal authorities;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	changes to local limits;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	changes to the POTW's control mechanism as described in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	changes to the POTW's method for implementing categorical pretreatment standards;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)	a decrease in the frequency of self-monitoring or reporting required of industrial users;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vi) 	a decrease in the frequency of industrial user inspections or sampling by the POTW;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vii)	changes to the POTW's confidentiality procedures;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(viii)	significant reductions in the POTW's pretreatment program resources (including personnel commitments, equipment, and funding
levels); or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ix)	changes in the POTW's sludge disposal and management practices.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		The Director may designate other specific modifications in addition to those listed in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(c)1 as substantial
modifications.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		A modification that is not included in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(c)1 is none the less a substantial modification for purposes of
this Sub-Paragraph if the modification:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)		would have a significant impact on the operation of the POTW's pretreatment program;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	would result in an increase in pollutant loadings at the POTW; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	would result in less stringent requirements being imposed on industrial users of the POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	The POTW shall prepare a list of its industrial users meeting the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)1 and 2.  The list shall
identify the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)1 and 2 applicable to each industrial user and, for industrial users meeting
the criteria in Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.08(2)(p)3, 4, or 5, shall also indicate whether the POTW has made a determination pursuant
to Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.08(3)(b) that such industrial user should not be considered a significant industrial user.  This list, and
any subsequent modifications thereto, shall be submitted to the EPD as a nonsubstantial program modification pursuant to Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(7)(b)2.  Discretionary designations or de-designations by the POTW pretreatment program shall be deemed
to be approved by the EPD ninety (90) days after submission of the list or modifications thereto, unless the EPD determines that a
modification is in fact a substantial modification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(8)	Compliance Monitoring and Reporting Requirements for POTW Pretreatment Programs and the EPD Pretreatment
Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Both the EPD and each POTW pretreatment program shall develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with the
requirements of a pretreatment program.  At a minimum, these procedures shall enable the EPD and the POTW to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Identify and locate all possible industrial users which might be subject to the pretreatment program;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Identify the character and volume of pollutants contributed to the POTW by the industrial users identified under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(8)(a)1;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Notify industrial users identified under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(8)(a)1 of applicable pretreatment standards and any applicable
pretreatment requirements under Sections 204(b) and 405 of the Federal Act and Subtitles C and D of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act.  Notify each significant industrial user of its status as such and of all requirements applicable to it as a result of
such status;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.		Receive and analyze self-monitoring reports and other notices submitted by industrial users in accordance with the self-monitoring
requirements in 40 CFR 403.12;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.		Randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent
of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards.  Inspect and
sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>6.		Evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each such significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges based
on the requirements in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v) and require such plans when appropriate;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7.		Investigate instances of noncompliance with pretreatment standards and requirements, as indicated in the reports and notices
required under 40 CFR 403.12 or indicated by analysis, inspection, and surveillance activities.  Sample taking and analysis and the

proceedings;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>8.		Comply with the public participation requirements of 40 CFR Part 25 in the enforcement of national pretreatment standards.  These
procedures shall include provision for at least annual public notification, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality
in which the POTW is located, of industrial users which, at any time during the previous twelve months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements as defined under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.08(2)(q); and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>9.		Deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, to the POTW by industrial users where such contributions do not meet
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
Permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Both the EPD pretreatment program and each POTW pretreatment program shall require the following industrial user reports and
notifications for their regulated industrial users:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Notice of potential problems including slug loading as described in 40 CFR 403.12(f);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Report on the monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance as described in 40 CFR 403.12(g)(1)-(5);

priority pollutants as listed under Sub-Paragraphs 391-3-6-.03(5)(d)(I)(ii) and (iii) and any other identified pollutants at a frequency
that adequately characterizes pollutant loading at the POTW.  In addition, the POTW pretreatment program may be required to
conduct biomonitoring of the POTW effluent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(9)	Legal Authority Requirements for POTW Pretreatment Programs.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall operate pursuant to a legal authority enforceable in Federal, State or local courts, which
authorizes or enables the POTW to apply and to enforce the requirements of sections 307 (b) and (c), and 402(b)(8) of the Federal
Act and any regulations implementing those sections.  Such authority may be contained in a statute, ordinance, or series of contracts
or joint powers agreements which the POTW is authorized to enact, enter into or implement and which are authorized by the Act. 
At a minimum, this legal authority shall enable the POTW to:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Require compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements by industrial users;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Control through permit, order, or similar means, the contribution to the POTW by each industrial user to ensure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.  In the case of industrial users identified as significant under Sub-Paragraph
391-3-6-.08(2)(p), this control shall be achieved through permits or equivalent individual control mechanisms issued to each such
user, be enforceable and contain the minimum conditions described in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii).  Each pretreatment permit will include,
where appropriate, conditions and limits which ensure that concentration and mass limit requirements under 40 CFR 403.6(c)(1)-(7),
dilution prohibition requirements under 40 CFR 403.6(d) and combined wastestream formula requirements under 40 CFR
403.6(e)(1)-(4) are complied with;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.		Require the development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for the installation of technology required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial
users as are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements, including
but not limited to the reports required in 40 CFR 403.12;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.		Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to determine, independent of information supplied by
industrial users, compliance or noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements by industrial users. 
Representatives of the POTW shall be authorized to enter any premises of any industrial user in which a discharge source or
treatment system is located or in which records are required to be kept under 40 CFR 403.12(o) to assure compliance with
pretreatment standards.  Such authority shall be at least as extensive as the authority provided under Section 308 of the Federal Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.		Obtain remedies for noncompliance by any industrial user with any pretreatment standard and requirement.  All POTW's shall be
able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements.  All POTWs shall
also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000 a day for each violation by industrial
users of pretreatment standards and requirements.  Pretreatment requirements which will be enforced through the remedies set forth
in this Sub-Paragraph will include but not be limited to, the duty to allow or carry out inspections, entry, or monitoring activities; any
rules, regulations or orders issued by the POTW; any requirements set forth in individual control mechanisms issued by the POTW;
or any reporting requirements imposed by the POTW or these regulations.  The POTW shall have authority and procedures (after
informal notice to the discharger) to immediately and effectively halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW which
reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.  The POTW shall also have authority
and procedures (which shall include notice to the affected industrial users and an opportunity to respond) to halt or prevent an
endangerment to the environment or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>6.		Comply with the confidentiality requirements set forth in 40 CFR 403.14.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall develop and implement an enforcement response plan which contains detailed procedures
indicating how a POTW will investigate and respond to instances of industrial user noncompliance.  The plan shall be developed in
accordance with requirements described in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall ensure that industrial users comply with the deadline for compliance with categorical
standards as described in 40 CFR 403.6(b) or take appropriate enforcement action to address noncompliance with 40 CFR 403.6(b)
through the enforcement response plan under Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.09(9)(b).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall ensure that proper legal authority exists to require industrial user compliance with the
general prohibitions under 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1), the specific prohibitions under 40 CFR 403.5(b)(1)-(8) and local limits under 40 CFR
403.5(c) and (d).  Each POTW developing a POTW pretreatment program pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8 shall develop and enforce
specific limits as described under 40 CFR 403.5(c) and (d) to implement the prohibitions listed in 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1) and 40 CFR
403.5(b)(1)-(8).  Each POTW pretreatment program shall continue to develop these limits as necessary and effectively enforce such
limits.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(10)	POTW Pretreatment Program Annual Report.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Each POTW pretreatment program shall provide the EPD with a report that describes POTW program activities including activities
of all participating agencies if more than one jurisdiction is involved in the local program.  The report required by this Sub-Paragraph
shall be submitted no later than one year after approval of the POTW's pretreatment program and at least annually thereafter and
shall include, at a minimum, the information required in 40 CFR 403.12(I).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(11)	Director Oversight Authority of POTW Pretreatment Program.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	The Director retains the authority to enforce all pretreatment standards (including categorical standards, prohibited discharge
standards, and local limits as described in 40 CFR 403) in cases where the EPD determines that insufficient enforcement action
has been taken by the POTW pretreatment program against industrial users.  The Director also has the legal authority to review self-monitoring reports submitted by the industrial user as described in 403.10(f)(1)(ii) and to carry out inspection surveillance, and
monitoring procedures as described in 403.10(f)(1)(iii).  The Director also has the legal authority to obtain remedies for
noncompliance as described in 403.8(f)(1)(vi).

<p><strong>391-3-6-.10  Determinations of Categorization of Industrial Users and Requests for Fundamentally Different Factors Variances.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)</strong>	<strong>	Purpose.</strong>  The purpose of Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10 is to provide for uniform procedures and practices to be followed for the
determination of categorization of industrial users and requests for variances for fundamentally different factors.  Such
determinations will be applicable to the approved local POTW pretreatment programs and the pretreatment programs supervised
and operated by the EPD.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)		Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act unless
otherwise defined in the Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)	</strong>	<strong>Determinations on Categorization of Industrial Users.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of a pretreatment standard for a sub-category under which an industrial user believes
itself to be included, the industrial user or POTW may request that the Director provide written certification to the effect that the
industrial user does or does not fall within that particular category.  If an existing industrial user adds or changes a process or
operation which may be included in a sub-category, the existing industrial user must request this certification prior to commencing
discharge from the added or changed process or operation.  A new source must request this certification prior to commencing
discharge.  Where a request for certification is submitted by a POTW, that POTW shall notify any affected industrial user of such
submission.  The industrial user may provide written comments on the POTW submission to the EPD within thirty (30) days of
notification.  Each request shall contain a statement:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.		Describing which sub-categories might be applicable;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.		Citing evidence and reasons why a particular sub-category is applicable and why others are not applicable.  Each statement shall
contain a certification stating that the facts contained therein are true on the basis of the applicant's personal knowledge or to the best
of his information and belief.  The certification shall be attested to by a notary public and be specifically as written in 40 CFR
403.6(a)(2)(ii).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		The Director will act only on written requests for determinations that contain all of the information required.  Persons who have made
incomplete submissions will be notified by the Director that their requests are deficient and unless the time period is extended they
will be given thirty (30) days to correct the deficiency.  If the deficiency is not corrected within thirty (30) days or within an extended
period allowed by the Director the request for a determination shall be denied.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		When the Director determines that all of the information required by this Sub-Paragraph, any additional evidence that may have
been requested and any other available information relevant to the request has been submitted, he will make a written determination
of the applicable sub-category and state the reasons for his determination.  The Director shall forward the written determination
described in this Sub-Paragraph to the Regional Administrator of EPA in accordance with 40 CFR 124.62(e)(1) who may make
a final determination.  If the Regional Administrator does not modify the Director's decision within sixty (60) days after receipt
thereof, the Director's decision is final.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		The Director shall send a copy of his determination to the affected industrial user and POTW.  When the final determination is
made by the Regional Administrator of EPA, he shall send a copy of his determination to the Director and the Director will forward
it to the affected industrial user and POTW.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		If an industrial user fails to seek the certification referred to in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10(3) within the prescribed thirty (30) day
period or to contest a negative determination through administrative channels provided, they will be bound by a subsequent
determination made by the Director as to the sub-category under which an industrial user should be included.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)		Fundamentally Different Factors Variances.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)		Requests for a variance from categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors and supporting evidence must
be submitted in writing to the Director within ninety (90) days after promulgation by the EPA of the categorical pretreatment
standards.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.			Written submissions for variance requests submitted to the Director must include:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)			the name and address of the person making the request;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)		identification of the interest of the requestor which is affected by the categorical pretreatment standard for which the variance is
requested;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)		identification of the POTW currently receiving the waste from the industrial user for which alternative discharge limits are requested;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)		identification of the categorical pretreatment standards which are applicable to the industrial user;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)		a list of each pollutant or pollutant parameter for which an alternative discharge limit is  sought;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vi)		the alternative discharge limits proposed by the requestor for each pollutant or pollutant parameter identified in Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10(4)(a)1(v);

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(vii)		a description of the industrial user's existing water pollution control facilities;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(viii)		a schematic flow representation of the industrial user's water system including water supply processed wastewater systems, and
points of discharge; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ix)		a statement of facts clearly establishing why the variance requests should be approved, including detailed support data,
documentation, and evidence necessary to fully evaluate the merits of the request, including technical and economic data collected
by the EPA and used in developing each pollutant discharge limit in the pretreatment standard.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)		The Director will only act on written requests for variances that contain all of the information required.  Persons who have made
incomplete submissions will be notified by the Director that their requests are deficient and unless the time period is extended, will
be given thirty (30) days to correct the deficiency.  If the deficiency is not corrected within the thirty (30) days or within an extended
period allowed by the Director, the request for variance shall be denied.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)		When the Director receives a submittal from a person making a request, he will, after determining that it contains all of the
information required by Sub-Paragraph 391-3-6-.10(4)(a), consider the submission, any additional evidence that may have been
requested, and any other available information relevant to the request.  The Director will then make a written finding indicating
whether or not there are factors which are fundamentally different for that industrial user, from those factors considered in the
development of the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards.  This preliminary finding will include the reasons as to whether
or not the variance should be granted.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)		When the Director finds that fundamentally different factors do not exist, he may deny the request and notify the requestor and the
industrial user, where they are not the same, of the denial.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)		When the Director finds that fundamentally different factors do exist, he shall forward the request and a written recommendation
that the request be approved to the Regional Administrator of EPA.  If upon review of the recommended approval submitted by the
Director, the Regional Administrator of EPA finds that fundamentally different factors do exist and that a partial or full variance is
justified, he will approve the variance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)		A request for a variance based upon fundamentally different factors shall be approved only if the applicable criteria are met as
described in 40 CFR 403.13(c).  A review of each request shall be made based upon factors considered fundamentally different as
described in 40 CFR 403.13(d) and factors which will not be considered fundamentally different as described in 40 CFR 403.13(e).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(5)	</strong>	<strong>Enforcement.</strong>  Any person who violates any provision of the Act, any rule promulgated and adopted pursuant thereto, or any term,
condition, schedule or compliance or other requirements contained in a permit issued pursuant to the Act shall be subject to
enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Act.

<p><strong>391-3-6-.11  Land Disposal and Permit Requirements</strong>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)	Purpose</strong>.  The purpose of this Paragraph 391-3-6-.11 is to provide for the degree of pollutant treatment required and
the uniform procedures and practices to be followed relating to the application for and the issuance or revocation of
permits for the discharge of pollutants into land disposal or land treatment systems and then into the waters of the
State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)	Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the
Act unless otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	"Act" means the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, as amended;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	"Land disposal system" means any method of disposing of pollutants in which the pollutants are applied to the surface
or beneath the surface of a parcel of land and which results in the pollutants percolating, infiltrating, or being absorbed
into the soil and then into the waters of the State.  Land disposal systems exclude landfills and sanitary landfills but
include ponds, basins, or lagoons used for disposal of wastes or wastewaters, where evaporation and/or percolation
of the wastes or wastewaters are used or intended to be used to prevent point discharge of pollutants into waters of
the State.  Septic tank systems, as defined in Chapter 270-5-25.01 and as approved by appropriate County Boards of
Public Health, are not considered land disposal systems for purposes of Chapter  391-3-6-.11.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	"Land treatment system" means any land disposal system in which vegetation on the site is used to remove some of
the pollutants applied;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	"Treatment requirement" means any restriction or prohibition established under the Act on quantities, rates, or
concentrations, or a combination thereof, of chemical, physical, biological, or other constituents which are discharged
into a land disposal or land treatment system and then into the waters of the State, including but not limited to
schedules of compliance;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	"Land disposal system permit application" means an application filed by any person with the Director for a land disposal
system permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)	"Land disposal system permit" means any permit issued by the Division to regulate the discharge of any pollutant into
a land disposal or land treatment system;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(g)	"Hydraulic loading rate" is the rate at which wastes or wastewaters are discharged to a land disposal or land treatment
system, expressed in volume per unit area per unit time or depth of water per unit area per unit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)</strong>	<strong>Land Disposal System Permit Requirement.</strong>  Any person discharging or proposing to discharge domestic, municipal,
commercial, or industrial wastes or wastewaters into a land disposal or land treatment system and then into the waters
of the State, under any of the circumstances described in Section 10 of the Act, shall obtain a permit from the Division
to make such a discharge.  Owners of land disposal or land treatment systems which employ overland flow, subsurface
drain fields, or other techniques which result in one or more point discharges into surface waters of the State, must
obtain an NPDES permit and will not be issued a land disposal system permit.  The provisions of Section 39-3-6-.08
regarding pretreatment apply to publicly owned treatment works which employ land disposal or land treatment systems.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)</strong>	<strong>Degree of Pollutant Treatment Required.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	All pollutants discharged into land disposal or land treatment system shall receive such treatment or corrective action
so as to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the issued land disposal system permit.  The Division has
the authority to establish the degree of treatment required before the pollutant is discharged to a land disposal or a land
treatment system and then into waters of the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Any pollutants which are being discharged or are intended to be discharged to a land disposal or land treatment system
in amounts or concentrations which could be toxic or otherwise harmful to humans or biota if those pollutants mingle
with waters of the State, or in amounts or concentrations which could reduce or impair the usefulness or operation of
the land disposal or land treatment system, must receive such treatment as the Division may specify prior to being
discharged to the land disposal or land treatment system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	The hydraulic loading rate for any land disposal or land treatment system shall be determined based upon a technical
analysis of soils and vegetation in the system area, climatic data characteristics of the wastes to be disposed or treated,
and previous experience with similar systems.  Hydraulic loading rates may not exceed those established in guidelines
issued by the Division unless such technical analysis proves to the satisfaction of the Division that higher rates can be
used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	No land disposal system permit shall be issued authorizing the discharge of any radiological, chemical, or biological
warfare agent or high-level radioactive waste into a land disposal or land treatment system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	The groundwater leaving the land disposal systems boundaries must not exceed maximum contaminant levels for
drinking water in accordance with Chapter 391-3-5 and subsequent amendments.

pollutant treatment requirements and limitations or other requirements contained in such permit at the time same is
issued, shall be required to achieve compliance with such pollutant treatment requirements and limitations or other
requirements in accordance with the schedule of compliance as set forth in such permit, or in the absence of a schedule
of compliance, by the date set forth in such permit which the Director has determined to be the shortest reasonable
period of time necessary to achieve compliance;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Within 14 days after an interim date of compliance or the final date of compliance specified in a land disposal system
permit, the permittee shall provide the Director with written notice of his compliance or non-compliance with the
requirements and conditions specified to be completed by such date.  Failure to submit the written notice is just cause
for the Division to pursue enforcement action pursuant to the Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	 A permittee who fails or refuses to comply with an interim or final date of compliance specified in a land disposal
system permit may be deemed by the Director to be in violation of the permit and may be subject to enforcement action

requirements as may be reasonably required by the Director including the installation, use and maintenance of
monitoring equipment or methods, including monitoring wells; specific requirements for recording of monitoring
activities and results; and periodic reporting of monitoring results.  The monitoring, recording and reporting requirements
shall be specified in a permit when issued, provided, however, the Director may modify or require additional monitoring,
recording and reporting by written notification to the permittee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	The permittee shall be required to retain any records of monitoring activities and results for a minimum of three (3)
years, unless otherwise required or extended by the Director upon written notification.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Any holder of a permit which requires monitoring of the authorized pollutant discharge into a land disposal or land
treatment system and then into the waters of the State shall report periodically to the Division results of all required
monitoring activities on appropriate forms supplied by the Division.  The Division shall notify the permittee of the
frequency of reporting but in no case shall the reporting frequency be less than once per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(9)</strong>	<strong>Modification, Suspension and Termination of Land Disposal System Permits.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	The Director may revise or modify the schedule of compliance set forth in an issued land disposal system permit if the
permittee requests such modification or revision in writing.  The Director may grant requests in accordance with this
subparagraph if he determines after a documented showing by the permittee that good and valid cause (including acts
of God, strikes, floods, material shortages or other events over which the permittee has little or no control) exists for
such revision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	The Director may modify, suspend or terminate an issued land disposal system permit in whole or in part during its term
for cause, including, but not limited to, failure or refusal of the permittee to carry out the requirements of the Act or
regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and if within 30 days following receipt of such notice of such proposed
modification, suspension or termination from the Director there is no objection by the permittee in writing.  Prior to any
such modification, suspension or termination of an issued land disposal system permit by the Director (other than
modification or revision of compliance schedule pursuant to subparagraph (a) above or modification of the monitoring,
recording or reporting requirements), the Director will provide public notice in accordance with the procedures set forth
in subparagraph 391-3-6.11 (6)(b) and an opportunity for public hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth
in subparagraph 391-3-6.11 (6)(c).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(10)</strong>	<strong>Non-governmentally Owned Sewerage Systems.</strong>  In cases involving nongovernmentally owned sewerage systems, a
trust indenture or other legal contract or agreement, approved by the Division, assuring continuity of operation of the
system, may be required to be filed with the application for a permit.  This provision shall not be applicable to systems
treating or disposing only industrial waste.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(11)</strong>	<strong>Duration and Transferability of Land Disposal System Permits.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Any land disposal system permit issued under Section 10 of the Act shall have a fixed term not to exceed five years. 
Upon expiration of such permit a new permit may be issued by the Director, provided that an application for renewal
is filed with the Director at least 180 days prior to the expiration date of the existing permit.  The issuance of such new
permit shall likewise have a fixed term not to exceed five years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	A permit may be transferred to another person by a permittee if:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	The permittee notifies the Director of the proposed transfer;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	A written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility and coverage between the current
and new permittees (including acknowledgment that the existing permittee is liable for violations up to that date, and
that the new permittee is liable for violations from that date on) is submitted to the Director; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	The Director within thirty (30) days does not notify the current permittee and the new permittee of the Division's intent
to modify, revoke and reissue, or terminate the permit and to require that new application be filed rather than agreeing
to the transfer of the permit.  A new application will be required when the change of ownership is accompanied by a
change or proposed change in process or wastewater characteristics or a change or a potential change in any
circumstances that the Director believes will affect the conditions or restrictions in the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(12)</strong>	<strong>Enforcement.</strong>  Any person who violates any provision of the Act, any rule promulgated and adopted pursuant thereto,
or any term, condition, schedule of compliance or other requirement contained in a permit issued pursuant to the Act
shall be subject to enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Act.

with Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 144.4, 40 C.F.R. 144.51 and 40 C.F.R. 144.52, Rule 391-3-6-.13(9) of this Chapter and as may
be additionally required by the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	No Injection Well Permit shall be issued authorizing the movement of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of
drinking water if the presence of that contaminant may cause a violation of any primary drinking water regulation set forth in Georgia
Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Chapter 391-3-5, or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons. The applicant for a permit shall
have the burden of showing that the requirement of this paragraph is met.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	When the corrective action plan as required in Paragraph 391-3-6-.13(9) is adequate, the Director shall incorporate it into the permit as
a condition.  Where the Director's review of an application indicates that the permittee's plan is inadequate (based on the factors in
Federal Regulations 40, C.F.R. 146.07), the Director shall require the applicant to revise the plan, prescribe a plan for corrective action
as a condition of the permit under paragraph (b) of this section, or deny the application.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	No owner or operator of a new injection well may begin injection until all required corrective action has been taken.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	The Director may require as a permit condition that injection pressure be so limited that pressure in the injection zone does not exceed
hydrostatic pressure at the site of any improperly completed or abandoned well within the area of review.  This pressure limitation shall
satisfy the corrective action requirement.  Alternatively, such injection pressure limitation can be part of a compliance schedule and last
until all other required corrective action has been taken.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	When setting corrective action requirements for Class III wells the Director shall consider the overall effect of the project on the hydraulic
gradient in potentially affected underground sources of drinking water, and the corresponding changes in potentiometric surface(s) and
flow direction(s) rather than the discrete effect of each well.  If a decision is made that corrective action is not necessary based on the
determinations above, the monitoring program required in Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 146.33(b) shall be designed to verify the validity
of such determination.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	The permittee shall report any monitoring or other information which indicates any contaminant that may cause an endangerment of a
fresh water zone or underground source of drinking water or any noncompliance with a permit condition or malfunction of the injection
system which may cause fluid migration into or between fresh water zones or underground sources of drinking water.  Any
noncompliance with a permit condition or a malfunction of the injection information shall be reported by telephone to the Director within
twenty four (24) hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of the noncompliance and a written submission within five (5) days
of the oral notification.  The written submission shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause, the period of
noncompliance including exact dates and times, the corrective action taken to reduce or eliminate the noncompliance, and the steps
planned to prevent a recurrence of the noncompliance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(e)	The permittee is required to maintain financial responsibility and resources to close, plug and abandon the underground injection
operation in a manner prescribed by the Director.  The permittee must show evidence of financial responsibility to the Director by the
submission of surety bond, or other adequate assurance, such as financial statements or other materials acceptable to the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)	The permittee shall operate the well so as not to exceed maximum injection volumes and pressures as necessary to assure that fractures
are not initiated in the confining zone; that injected fluids do not migrate into fresh water zones or underground sources of drinking water;
or that formation fluids are not displaced into underground sources of drinking water.  The Director shall establish such volumes and
pressure limits as permit conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(g)	Injection may not commence until construction is complete and written approval to commence has been given by the Director.  The
permittee shall submit notice of completion of construction to the Director including:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	All available logging and testing program data on the well;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	A demonstration of the mechanical integrity of the well;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	The anticipated maximum pressure and flow rate at which the permittee will operate;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	The results of the formation testing program;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.	The actual injection procedure;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>6.	The compatibility of injected waste with the fluids in the injection zone; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7.	The status of corrective action on defective wells in the area of review to prevent fluid movement into underground sources of drinking
water.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(h)	The permittee shall notify the Director in writing of any proposal to abandon an injection well and that the plugging and abandonment plan
approved as part of the permit will be followed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	A permit shall be issued for a period not to exceed five (5) years from the date of issuance.  On expiration of the permit the permit shall
become invalid and the injection prohibited unless application is made at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date for a reissuance
of the permit.  When a permittee has submitted a timely and sufficient application for a new Injection Well Permit and the Director is
unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue the new permit before the expiration date of the existing permit, then the Director shall
extend the existing permit until a new permit is issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(j)	A permit may be transferred to any person provided the permittee notifies the Director in writing at least 30 days in advance of the
proposed transfer date and the transfer is approved by the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(k)	The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort or any exclusive privilege.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(l)	The permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause, or minor modifications may be made in accordance with
Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 124.5, 144.39 and 144.41.  The permittee shall furnish the Director any information which the Director
may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing or terminating a permit or to determine compliance
with the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(m)	The Director may terminate a permit during its term or deny a permit renewal for the following causes:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	Noncompliance by the permittee with any conditions of the permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	The permittee's failure in the application or during the permit issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or the permittee's
misrepresentation of any relevant facts at any time;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	A determination that the permitted activity endangers human health or the environment and can only be regulated to acceptable levels
by permit modification of termination; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	A failure by the permittee to demonstrate that continuation of the operation under the permit will not result in degradation of the water
quality.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(n)	For Class I, II and III Wells, if any water quality monitoring of an underground source of drinking water indicates the movement of any
contaminant into the underground source of drinking water, the Director shall prescribe such additional requirements for construction,
corrective action, operation, monitoring or reporting (including closure of the injection well) as are necessary to prevent such movement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(o)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this rule the Director may issue a temporary permit for a specific injection in accordance with
the Federal Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 144.34.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(9)	Corrective Action.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Applicants for Class I, II, or III injection well permits shall identify the location of all known wells within the injection well's area of review
which penetrate the injection zone, or in the case of Class II wells operating over the fracture pressure of the injection formation, all known
wells within the area of review penetrating formations affected b the increase in pressure.  For such wells which are improperly sealed,
completed, or abandoned, the applicant shall also submit a plan consisting of such steps or modifications as are necessary to prevent
movement of fluid into underground sources of drinking water (corrective action).  Where the plan is adequate, the Director shall
incorporate it into the permit as a condition.  Where the Director's review of an application indicates that the permittee's plan is inadequate
(based on the factors in subparagraph 391-3-6-.13(8)(c)), the Director shall require the applicant to revise the plan, prescribe a plan for
corrective action as a condition of the permit under subparagraph (b) of this paragraph or deny the application.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	In determining the adequacy of corrective action proposed by the applicant under this paragraph and in determining the additional steps

<p><strong>391-3-6-.16  Storm Water Permit Requirements</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(1)</strong>	<strong>Purpose.</strong>  The purpose of this Paragraph 391-3-6-.16 is to provide for the uniform procedures and practices to be followed relating to
the application for issuance, modification, revocation and reissuance, and termination of permits for the discharge of any storm Water
into the waters of the State.  Unless specifically adopted by reference herein, no other part of this Chapter 391-3-6 shall govern the
issuance of any storm Water permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(2)</strong>	<strong>Definitions.</strong>  All terms used in this Paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions as set forth in the Act and in 40
C.F.R. 122.26(b) unless otherwise defined in this Paragraph or in any other Paragraph of these Rules:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	"Area Wide Permit" means either an individual or a general permit issued to a municipality or a group of municipalities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	"Associated with Industrial Activity" means any industrial activity or industrial facility identified in 40 C.F.R. 122.26(b)(14).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	"Storm Water Point Source" means a conveyance or system of conveyances (including pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels or sheet
flow which is later conveyed) primarily used for collecting and conveying storm Water runoff excluding conveyances that discharge storm
Water runoff combined with municipal sewage.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(3)</strong>	<strong>Permit Requirements.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Authorization to Discharge.  Storm Water point sources, as defined in this Paragraph, are point sources subject to the NPDES permit
program.  The Director may issue an NPDES permit or permits for discharges into waters of the State from a storm Water source
covering all conveyances which are part of that storm Water point source.  Where there is more than one owner or operator of a storm
Water point source, any or all discharges into that storm Water point source may be identified in the application submitted by the owner
or operator of the portion of the storm Water point source that discharges directly into waters of the State.  Any such application shall
include all information regarding discharges into the storm Water point source that would be required if the dischargers submitted
separate applications.  Dischargers so identified shall not require a separate permit unless the Director specifies otherwise.  Any permit
covering more than one owner or operator shall identify the effluent limitations, if any, which apply to each owner or operator.  Where
there is more than one owner or operator, no discharger into the storm Water point source may be subject to a permit condition for
discharges into the storm Water source other than its own discharges into that system without his consent.  All dischargers into a storm
Water point source must either be covered by an individual permit, an area wide permit or a general permit issued to the owner or operator
of that portion of the system that directly discharges into waters of the State.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Applicability.  The following discharges composed entirely of storm Water are required to obtain an NPDES permit for the storm Water
discharge:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	Associated with industrial activity;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	Large municipal separate storm sewer systems;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	Medium municipal separate storm sewer systems; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	Any storm Water point source that the Director determines to contribute to a violation of a Water quality standard or is a significant
contributor of pollutants to the waters of the State as provided in 40 C.F.R. 122.26.  In making this determination the Director shall
consider the following factors:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	The location of the storm Water point source with respect to waters of the State;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	The size of the storm Water point source;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	The quantity and nature of the pollutants reaching waters of the State; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	Other relevant factors.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.	Case-by-case designation of storm Water point sources. The Director may designate a conveyance or system of conveyances primarily
used for collecting and conveying storm Water runoff as a storm Water point source.  This designation may be made to the extent
allowed or required by effluent limitations guidelines for point sources in the storm Water discharge category or when a Water Quality
Management Plan under Section 208 of the Federal CWA Act which contains requirements applicable to such point sources is approved.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	General provisions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	General and area wide permits may be issued, modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated in accordance with applicable requirements
of paragraph 391-3-6-.16.  Public notice and public participation for issuance, modification, revocation and reissuance, and termination
of general permits shall be in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.16(7).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	The contents of the notice of intent shall be specified in the general permit and shall conform to the requirements specified in 40 C.F.R.
122.28.  The notice of intent shall be signed in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.16(5)(a)6.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.	General permits shall specify the deadline for submitting notices of intent to be covered and the date(s) when a discharge is authorized
under the permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.	General permits shall specify whether a discharger that has submitted a timely notice of intent to be covered in accordance with a general
permit and that is eligible for coverage under the general permit, is authorized to discharge in accordance with the general permit either
upon receipt of the notice of intent by the Director, after a waiting period specified in the general permit, on a date specified in the general
permit, or upon receipt of notification of inclusion by the Director.  Coverage may be revoked in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.16(3)(c)(5).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.	Requiring an individual permit for storm Water discharges associated with industrial activity.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	The Director may require any person authorized by a general permit for storm Water discharges associated with industrial activity to apply
for and obtain an individual NPDES permit.  Any interested person may petition the Director to take action under this paragraph.  Cases
where an individual NPDES permit may be required include the following:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(I)	The discharge(s) is a significant contributor of pollution as determined by the Director.  In making this determination, the Director may
consider the following factors:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(1)	The location of the discharge with respect to the waters of the State;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(2)	The size of the discharge;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(3)	The quantity and nature of the pollutants discharged to waters of the State; and

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(4)	Other relevant factors.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(II)	The discharger is not in compliance with the conditions of the general permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(III)	A change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement of pollutants applicable
to the point source;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(IV)	Effluent limitation guidelines are promulgated for point sources covered by the general  permit;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(V)	A Water Quality Management Plan containing requirements applicable to such point sources is approved; or

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(VI)	Circumstances have changed since the time of the request to be covered so that the discharger is no longer appropriately controlled
under the general permit, or either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge is necessary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(ii)	Any owner or operator authorized by a general permit may request to be excluded from the coverage of the general permit by applying
for an individual NPDES permit.  The owner or operator shall submit an application under subparagraph 391-3-6-.06(5), with reasons
supporting the request, to the Director .

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iii)	When an individual NPDES permit is issued to an owner or operator otherwise subject to a general permit, the applicability of the general
permit to the individual NPDES permittee is automatically terminated on the effective date of the individual NPDES permit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(iv)	A source excluded from a general permit solely because it already has an individual NPDES permit may request that the individual
NPDES permit be revoked, and that it be covered by the general permit.  Upon revocation of the individual NPDES permit, the general
permit shall apply to the source.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(v)	Whenever the Director decides an individual NPDES permit is required, the Director shall notify the discharger in writing of the decision
and the reasons for it, and shall send an application form with the notice.  The discharger must apply for a permit under subparagraph
391-3-6-.06(5) and 40 C.F.R. 122.21 within sixty (60) days of notice unless a later date is granted by the Director.  Public notice and
public participation shall be in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.06(7).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(4)	Degree of Waste Treatment Required.</strong>  All pollutants shall receive such treatment or corrective action so as to ensure compliance with
the terms and conditions of the issued permit and with the following, whenever applicable:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Effluent limitations established by the EPA pursuant to Sections 301, 302, 303, 306, 307, 308, 318, and 405 of the Federal  Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(b)	Criteria and standards for Best Management Practices established by EPA pursuant to Section 304(e) of the Federal  Act;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(c)	Notwithstanding the above, more stringent effluent limitations may be required as deemed necessary by the Division (a) to meet any other
existing Federal laws or regulations, or (b) to ensure compliance with any applicable State Water quality standards, effluent limitations,
treatment standards, or schedules of compliance;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(d)	Calculations and specification of effluent limits and standards shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Federal Regulations,
40 CFR 122.44(k) and 122.45; provided, however, that in regard to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(2), the feasibility of establishing numeric effluent
limitations shall be made by the Director based upon best professional judgement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>(5)</strong>	<strong>Applications.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(a)	Application Requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.	Municipal separate storm sewer systems shall submit an application in accordance with the requirements specified in 40 C.F.R.
122.26(d) and 40 C.F.R. 122.26(g) unless otherwise modified by the Director.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.	Discharges associated with industrial activity shall either submit an application for an individual NPDES permit in accordance with
subparagraph 391-3-6-.06 or apply for coverage under a general permit in accordance with paragraph 391-3-6-.16.  Application for an
individual NPDES permit shall be made in accordance with subparagraph 391-3-6-.06 and 40 C.F.R. 122.26(c) and 40 C.F.R. 122.26(g). 
A discharger who fails to submit a notice of intent in accordance with the terms of the general permit is not authorized to discharge under
the terms of the general permit.  A complete and timely notice of intent to be covered in accordance with the general permit requirements,

permit and the Director is unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue the new permit before the expiration date of the existing
permit, then the Director shall extend the existing permit until a new permit is issued.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(f)	For those industrial categories for which EPA will establish effluent limitations based on best available technology, permits will be issued

and subsequent regulations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>(g)	Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) above, if a toxic effluent standard or prohibition (including any schedule of compliance specified in

Chattahoochee, Coosa, Flint and the Ocmulgee. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>O.C.G.A. Section 12-7 et. seq. requires a comprehensive
statewide soil erosion and sedimentation control program to
protect and conserve air, land, and water resources through the
adoption and implementation of local ordinances and programs
which regulate certain land disturbing activities generally
associated with urban development. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>House Bill 1788 requires the Board to establish turbidity
standards. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>Senate Bill 500 (ACT 1042) requires specific sanctions against
Atlanta for failure to meet phosphorus standards, establishes new
phosphorous limits for the Chattahoochee River, establishes
specific schedules and sanctions for CSO's for Atlanta. It also
requires certain assessments of water quality by the director
prior to the issuance of any permits for river basin transfer for
wastewater disposal and allows a 10% reduction in permit capacity
for a permit violation during July 1, 1996 to July 1, 1997. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>OC.G.A. Section 43-51 et. seq. requires that all operators of
water treatment, water distribution, wastewater treatment and
wastewater collection facilities obtain a certificate from the
state. It also requires that all analysts that perform tests, as
defined by the Board, in conjunction with the operation with a
water treatment or wastewater treatment plant, obtain a
certificate from the state. This section also delegates
classification of plants to EPD and allows EPD to require
certification in permits which EPD issues. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>O.C.G.A. Section 1205 et.seq. requires that all direct
discharges of wastewater to a stream or to a land disposal site
obtain a permit from the division; requires permits for certain
indirect dischargers to municipal sewer systems; requires the
division to establish water quality standards, lake water quality
standards, and water use classifications; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>House Bill 228 authorizes the department to adopt technical
and procedural rules governing sludge land application systems. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>O.C.G.A. Section 12-5-543, the Metropolitan River Protection
Act (MRPA) requires protection of the Chattahoochee River
corridor defined as all land within 2000 feet of the riverbanks
between Buford Dam and Peachtree Creek. It requires the Atlanta
Regional Commission to develop and administer a plan for
protecting the water and land resources of the corridor. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p>O.C.G.A.Sections 12-5-90 through 12-5-107 (Ground-Water Use
Act of 1972, as amended): requires persons to obtain a permit
from EPD prior to withdrawing, obtaining or using ground waters
in excess of 100,000 gallons per day. Law also requires the
issuance of a permit for ground water withdrawn for farm uses. <br

<h1 align=center><b>LAND PROTECTION BRANCH</b> </h1>
<p align=center><b>4244 International Parkway, Suite 104</b> <br>
<b>Atlanta, Georgia 30354</b> <br>
<b>(404) 362-2537</b> </p>
<hr>
<p>The Land Protection Branch encompassed a wide diversity of Programs dealing with waste management activities or programs 
designed to prevent the release of materials into the environment, which when released may cause environmental damage, risk 
to public health or the depletion of non renewable natural resources. Programs in the Branch include the following. </p>
<h3><b>Solid Waste Management Program</b> </h3>
<p>The Solid Waste Management Program is responsible for regulating 467 solid waste handling facilities to ensure such facilities 
do not adversely affect to public health, safety and the environment and to encourage the reduction, reuse, and recycling of the 
resources in solid waste when feasible. Solid waste handling facilities include landfills, incinerators, materials recovery facilities, 
transfer stations, compost facilities, and land application facilities. Activities include permitting of landfills and other handling 
facilities, closure and post-closure care of existing landfills, financial assurance, groundwater, surface water and methane gas 
monitoring, and inspection of site operations. Through compliance inspections, the program insures that all operating solid 
waste handling facilities and landfills in closure or post-closure care status are in compliance with the requirements of the 
Georgia Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Act and the Rules of Solid Waste Management and that potential releases 
to the environment are prevented or where releases have occurred, corrective action is taken to return the facilities to 
compliance. </p>
<p>The Act requires the cooperation of a team of State agencies. The Department of Natural Resources has two divisions active 
in solid waste management. In addition to the enforcement and compliance activities previously mentioned, the Environmental 
Protection Division (EPD) of DNR provides technical support to local governments, the regulated community and the general 
public. Integrated solid waste management is stressed and use of new technology such as co-composting is encouraged. The 
program is responsible for assisting local communities with planning assessment, code development, solid waste enforcement 
programs, and evaluation of grant funding. The Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P2AD) of DNR offers waste 
reduction technical assistance to business and industry, agriculture, governments, and the general public. The Department of 
Community Affairs (DCA) provides technical assistance to local governments in solid waste management, recycling, and waste 
reduction; reviews and approves local government solid waste management plans; educates the public; and provides an annual 
report on the status of solid waste management in Georgia. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority (GEFA) is a 
conduit through which the State provides solid waste related financial assistance to local governments. GEFA oversees several 
grant and loan programs that may be utilized by local governments for solid waste reduction efforts. All of the above agencies, 
together with local governments, private businesses and the general public, are working together to update the State solid 
waste management plan. EPD provides the overall coordination of statewide solid waste management activities. </p>
<p>In FY 1995, a total of 9,653,373 tons of solid waste were disposed in 136 permitted landfills in Georgia. A major emphasis of 
the program is the reduction of waste being disposed or if disposed, such disposal is in lined rather than unlined landfills. The 
Act sets a deadline of July, 1998 for all unlined landfills that received approval to vertically expand to cease receiving waste. 
All horizontal expansion must be lined as well. </p>
<p>Both operational as well as closed landfills are closely monitored to insure groundwater and other resources are not adversely 
impacted. </p>
<h3><b>Scrap Tire Program</b> </h3>
<p>There are approximately 6-7 million scrap tires generated annually in Georgia. In the past, many of these were improperly 
discarded. </p>
<p>The Scrap Tire Management Program is responsible for preventing the creation of new scrap tire piles and cleaning-up the 
existing tire piles around the State. The program regulates tire carriers, generators, retailers and processors of tires. A $1.00 
management fee is collected on the retail sale of new replacement tires. These fees are utilized for the clean-up of the scrap tire 
piles through the use of scrap tire abatement contractors or clean-up grants to local governments. The program also provides 
grants to local governments for develop solid waste enforcement program and for scrap tire/solid waste education programs. </p>
<p>In excess of 10.5 millions scrap tires/year are now being recycled by EPD approved facilities in Georgia. Most tires are being 
shredded into chips and used as supplement fuel by the paper mill industry and used as substitute gravel in septic tank drain 
lines, and various civil engineering projects. Tires are also being utilized in making other products such as bush hog wheels, 
dock bumpers, and landscaping mulch. A developing industry is the use of crumb rubber in the construction of rubber-asphalt 
highway construction projects, carpet manufacturing, rubber molded products and co-blending with plastics. </p>
<p>The Program has identified over 243 tire dumps throughout the state, encompassing over 5 million tires. Seventy four (74) of 
those sites, which included over 3 million tires, have been cleaned up through State Abatement Contractors and 
reimbursements to local governments. Efforts include the identification of all sites and their clean-up prior to the program 
statutory sunset in 2000. More sites are being found and the program continues to receive requests for abatement assistance 
from local governments, particularly for the clean-up of numerous smaller tire piles. These clean-ups are funded in conjunction 
with Enforcement and Education Grants to help these cities and counties hire an enforcement officer to inspect local tire 
dealers, generators, carriers, and processors and assure they are properly managing their scrap tires. The grants also allow 
them to educate their citizens about how and where to properly dispose of old tires, as well as the potential uses of and 
products made from recycled tires. To date, over a million dollars has been granted to 21 local governments for enforcement 
and education. As the larger site abatement program winds down, increased funding and emphasis will be shifted to local 
enforcement, education and other programs to prevent illegal tire dumping at the local level. </p>
<h3><b>Lead-Based Paint/Asbestos Abatement Program</b> </h3>
<p>The purpose of the program is to prevent lead-poisoning in occupants and workers of housing where abatement of lead-based 
paint is occurring, specifically children under the age of six. The Lead-Based Paint Abatement Certification Program 
implements regulations governing the training and certification of individuals, the accreditation of training providers, work 
standards, and enforcement. Lead poisoning can cause central nervous system disabilities, slower mental development, and 
other related problems. Improper lead-based paint abatement constitutes a serious threat to persons residing on or otherwise 
using an affected structure or site, to those performing such work, to the environment, and to the general public. </p>
<p>The Asbestos Program also requires licensing of contractors and training for asbestos supervisors. It insures the safe removal 
or encapsulation of friable asbestos-containing materials from facilities and residential dwellings in the safest manner possible. </p>
<p>Both the Lead and Asbestos Programs are fully funded by fees charged to certified trainers, individuals and workers, as well 
as fees on each abatement project. Project notification is required in order to select a small percentage of projects for 
compliance audits. In addition, all complaints are investigated to determine compliance with applicable standards. </p>
<h3><b>Surface Mining Program</b> </h3>
<p>The Surface Mining Program is responsible for protecting the environment, natural resources and citizens of Georgia from the 
adverse affects of surface mining. The removal of vegetation, soils and other changes which accompany surface mining 
operations could potentially result in adverse affects such as accelerated erosion, sterile soils, and sedimentation in surface 
waters. Regulatory activities include the issuing of surface mining permits to qualified applicants, conducting periodic on-site 
inspections of approximately 560 operations and conducting final on-site inspections to ascertain compliance with reclamation 
plans. Mining operations include kaolin, crushed stone, borrow pits, in-stream dredging, etc. The program is empowered to 
deny or revoke permits, issue consent orders, initiate court actions, and/or forfeit funds to conduct reclamation. </p>
<p>Reclamation is assured through the posting, with EPD, of up to $2,500/acre for mined lands. Should the required reclamation 
not be performed by the permit holder, EPD can require forfeiture of the bond and utilize such funds to contract directly for 
reclamation. </p>
<h3><b>Underground Storage Tank Management Program (USTMP)</b> </h3>
<p>The Underground Storage Tank Management Program is responsible for regulating approximately 49,000 underground 
storage tanks (USTs) at over 19,000 facilities in the state of Georgia to ensure such tanks do not leak petroleum or toxic 
chemicals into the environmental and, if leaks do occur, that the leaks are cleaned up. This Program is authorized by the 
Georgia Underground Storage tank Act, O.C.G.A. 12-13-1 and the Rules for Underground Storage Tank Management, 
Chapter 391-3-15. Activities of this Program fall into three major categories; (1) Regulatory Compliance, (2) Corrective 
Action, and (3) the Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Administration. </p>
<h3><b>USTMP - Regulatory Compliance</b> </h3>
<p>This function is aimed at preventing future petroleum and chemical releases. By December 22, 1998, all of the approximately 
49,000 regulated USTs in Georgia must comply with certain spill, overfill, and corrosion protection requirements. All &#147;new&#148; 
USTs (those installed after December 22, 1988) must meet these requirements at the time of installation, while the owners 
and/or operators of all &#147;existing&#148; USTs (those installed before December 22, 1988) are faced with taking one of the three 
following actions to comply with this deadline: (1) Add spill, overfill, and corrosion protection; (2) close the UST system by 
December 22, 1998; or (3) replace each closed existing UST with a new UST. </p>
<p>Of particular concern are the 18,500 existing unprotected (bare) steel tanks with associated piping which must meet the 
corrosion protection requirements by upgrading with one of three methods: (1) adding cathodic protection; (2) adding interior 
lining; or (3) adding cathodic protection and interior lining. </p>
<h3><b>USTMP - Corrective Action</b> </h3>
<p>Where releases have occurred or cannot be prevented, corrective action is required. Over 6,000 releases (leaks) from USTs 
have been reported in Georgia since 1988. Once notified of a release, the owner/operator (O/O) is required to immediately 
repair the leak and submit reports detailing the extent of contamination from the leak and the physical conditions of the site. 
Based on information in these reports, a determination is made regarding the need for corrective action, and if needed, what 
type of corrective action would be most appropriate. If corrective action is required, the O/O must submit a corrective action 
plan (CAP) that outlines how the contamination will be cleaned up. The CAP is reviewed and approved prior to remediation 
efforts. Inspections of the site are conducted to ensure cleanup efforts are in accordance with the approved plan. </p>
<p>If an O/O fails to clean up a contaminated site, an order may be issued requiring that corrective action be taken within a 
prescribed time frame. If the O/O fails to comply with the order, civil penalties up to $25,000 for each day of continued 
noncompliance may be imposed. </p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also provides funds to Georgia from the Federal Leaking Underground Storage 
Tank (LUST) Trust Fund (approximately $1.2 million per year) to clean up contaminated sites where a solvent O/O cannot be 
identified. </p>
<h3><b>USTMP - GUST Trust Fund Administration</b> </h3>
<p>Every UST O/O is required to have insurance or other financial assurance to ensure that leaks can be properly cleaned up. 
Georgia provides O/O with such a mechanism through the Georgia Underground Storage Tank (GUST) Trust Fund. The 
GUST Trust Fund is financed by a voluntary Environmental Assurance Fee (EAF) paid on each gallon of petroleum product 
delivered to regulated tanks in Georgia. The EAF can be adjusted by the Board of Natural Resources up to one cent per 
gallon. As of June 1996, the EAF was 0.2 cents per gallon and provides approximately $10 million/year to the GUST Trust 
Fund. Approximately 95% of the regulated community participate in the GUST Trust Fund. The fund provides each 
participating O/O with $1 million in corrective action and third-party liability coverage. Non-participating O/O must carry 
private insurance. </p>
<p>Coverage includes cleaning up leaked petroleum product, correcting environmental damage, supplying drinking water, and 
compensating third parties for personal injury or property damage. Interest from the Trust Fund helps pay for the cost of 
administering the Program. </p>
<p>To be eligible for reimbursement from the Trust Fund, the O/O must have paid the EAF and be in substantial compliance with 
UST rules and regulations. </p>

<h3 align=center><strong>GUIDANCE DOCUMENT<br>
Management of Yard Trimmings<br>
O.C.G.A. 12-8-40.2</strong><br>
</h3>
<p><strong><u>LEGISLATIVE INTENT</u></strong><br>
<tt>In the past, most yard trimmings have either been land filled or burned.<br>
Because yard trimmings may constitute up to 15% of waste entering <br>
landfills, and the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Act sets a 25% <br>
disposal reduction goal, management of yard trimmings by means other than<br>
land filling is critical.</tt></p>
<p><tt><br>
</tt>In O.C.G.A. 12-8-21.(g), the legislative intent for the handling of yard trimming is stated as follows:<br>
</p>
<pre>     <em><strong>&quot;It is further the intent of the General Assembly to provide a frame
 of reference for the state and all counties,municipal corporations, and 
solid waste management authorities in the state relating to the handling
of yard trimmings. The productivity of the soils of Georgia requires that
nature's way of recycling vegetative matter be respected and followed and
that such essential building materials are no longer wasted by being buried
in landfills but are returned to the soil.  The General Assembly, therefore,
adopts and recommends the following hierarchy for handling yard trimmings:</strong></em></pre>
<pre>     (1)  Naturalized, low-maintenance landscaping requiring little or not cutting;
     (2)  Grass cycling by mowing it high and letting it lie;
     (3)  Stacking branches into brush piles for use as wildlife habitats and for
          gradual decomposition into the soil;
     (4)  Composting on the site where the material was grown, followed by
          incorporation of the finished compost into the soil at that site;
     (5)  Chipping woody material on the site where such material was generated;
     (6)  Collecting yard trimmings and transporting them to another site to be
          chipped or composted for later
          use; and
     (7)  Chipping woody material for later use as fiber fuel.&quot;
</pre>
<p><strong><u>DEFINITION OF YARD TRIMMINGS</u></strong><br>
<tt>The Act defines yard trimmings as follows:</tt></p>
<pre> O.C.G.A. 12-8-22.(42) - <em>&quot;yard trimmings means leaves, brush, grass clippings,
 shrub and tree prunings,  discarded Christmas trees, nursery and greenhouse 
 vegetative residuals, and vegetative matter resulting from landscaping development
 and maintenance other than mining, agricultural and silvacultural operations.&quot;</em></pre>
<pre>Although it is recommended that land-clearing debris (trees, stumps, limbs, etc.) be
managed in the same manner as yard trimmings, it is important to note that these
materials are not legally considered yard trimmings and are therefore, not
banned from landfills.</pre>
<pre>SWM-GD Management of Yard Trimmings 2/96
</pre>
<p><strong><u>YARD TRIMMINGS DISPOSAL BAN</u></strong><br>
<tt>In order to encourage the reuse of yard trimmings, and to conserve 
landfill capacity, the Act at O.C.G.A. 12-8-40.2 established disposal 
restrictions of such waste in certain landfills.</tt></p>
<pre>Effective September 1, 1996, each city, county, or solid waste management
authority shall impose restrictions on handling for yard trimmings generated
or disposed of in respective jurisdictions.  These restrictions shall include,
but are not limited to, the following:
</pre>
<pre>1.   Yard trimmings must be separated from all municipal solid waste in order
     to facilitate collections and ultimate handling.
</pre>
<pre>2.   Disposal of yard trimmings is banned at certain types of landfills.
     These landfills include:</pre>
<ul>
<li><pre>all municipal solid waste landfills with liners/leachate collection systems. </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>all municipal solid waste landfills which have received a vertical expansion
under the Act (NOTE: this also includes all construction and demolition
landfills which have received a vertical expansion under the Act, since
they are considered a form of municipal solid waste landfill). </pre>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>3.   Disposal of yard trimmings are not banned at certain types of landfills.
     These landfills include:</pre>
<ul>
<li><pre>private industry landfills which take solid waste from their own industry
only; and </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>inert waste landfills which are considered permit-by-rule facilities. </pre>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>4.   Jurisdictions must require sorting and storage for collection in such a
     manner to facilitate collection, composting, or other handling.</pre>
<pre>5.   Yard trimmings must be:</pre>
<ul>
<li><pre>sorted and stockpiled, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>chipped, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>composted, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>used as a mulch, or </pre>
</li>
<li><pre>otherwise beneficially reused or recycled to the extent feasible. </pre>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>While the yard trimmings disposal restrictions must be in place for
all jurisdictions not later than September 1, 1996, the Act encourages
each city, county, or solid waste management authority to take the
initiative to impose such restrictions prior to September 1, 1996.</pre>

<h2 align="center"><b>GUIDANCE DOCUMENT</b></h2>
<h4 align="center"><b>DISPOSAL OF DEER PROCESSING WASTE</b></h4>
<p><i><u>ISSUE</u></i> </p>
<p>Many Deer Processors have been disposing of deer carcases by
routing this waste to rendering plants. Recently, some of the
rendering plants no longer accept animal carcasses other than
chickens. This change has been made to prevent the possible
introduction of &quot;Mad Cow&quot; disease. The elimination of
this handling option by some rendering facilities has presented a
dilemma for deer processors. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<i><u>HANDLING METHODS</u></i> </p>
<p>Deer carcasses retained by processing facilities are
considered to be &quot;Commercial Solid Waste&quot; as defined by
the Georgia Rules for Solid Waste Management. These Rules provide
for disposal of animal carcasses at permitted Municipal Solid
Waste Landfills (MSWL) when the waste is not directed to a
rendering facility for processing into a usable protein product.
If incineration or rendering are not available in your area,
arrangements will have to be made to dispose of deer carcasses in
a permitted MSWL. This waste must <u>not</u> be buried or dumped
in any location other than a MSWL. If a biomedical waste
incinerator is located nearby, this waste can be incinerated and
the ash can then be disposed in a MSWL. Many counties have
transfer stations which accept waste for bulk transfer to MSWLs.
These transfer stations may accept carcasses for transfer. <br
wp="br1">
</p>
<p><i><u>SPECIFIC GUIDANCE</u></i> </p>
<p>The following is general guidance in preparation and handling
of carcasses for transfer and disposal: <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p>Contact with the county transfer / disposal facility is
recommended as their requirements may be very specific for how
they can handle this waste. Many transfer stations / disposal
facilities will require that this waste be in a sealed container
and labeled to minimize their employee's exposure to this waste.
This waste should be carried to a transfer station or disposal
site on a routine schedule. This schedule should be at least
twice per week to prevent extensive decomposition of this waste.
Prior notification to the landfill is advised when large
quantities of this waste will be delivered in order for the
landfill to prepare for special handling and disposal. <br
wp="br1">
</p>
<p>Carcasses should be separated from other waste and
containerized. The processor should check with the transfer
station / disposal facility as to the preferred method for
containerization of carcasses. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Carcasses should not be held without refrigeration for more than
three days. Transport of carcasses must occur prior to extended
decomposition. Decomposition will occur faster in warmer
temperatures. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p><b>Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to
your local DNR Conservation Ranger</b>. <br wp="br1">

<body>
<h2 align=center>General Q &amp; A <br>
for Scrap Tire Management<br>
</h2>
<h4><u>$1.00 Per Tire Fees Issues</u></h4>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the purpose of the tire fee? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The fee will be used by the Environmental Protection Division to create grants and<br>
reimbursements to cities and counties, authorities, state agencies or the Market Development<br>
Council for:<br>
(1) The clean up of tire dumps<br>
(2) The development and implementation of solid waste enforcement programs for the<br>
abatement of illegal dumping of scrap tires<br>
(3) Implementation of innovative technologies for the recycling and reuse of scrap tires<br>
(4) Educational and other efforts to promote waste reduction, recycling, and recycling market<br>
development. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>

</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will the tire dealer (wholesaler or retailer) who sells large quantities of tires to large<br>
companies for the companies' own use be required to impose the $1.00 per tire sold fee? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, if the dealer is located in Georgia. No, if the company purchases the tires and are 
pickup outside of Georgia <br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Retail dealer A sells several tires to Retailer B; which dealer is responsible to impose the 
$1.00 fee? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: Retailer B is responsible to collect the fee (the dealer who sells the tires to the ultimate<br>

<br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will a retail dealer be allowed to add an additional charge to his invoices for disposal of 
the scrap tires? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. The $1.00 requirement is not a disposal fee. It is considered a tire management fee.<br>
<br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What tires are excluded from the $1.00 fee? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>

<br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. If the tires are delivered in Georgia, the fee must be imposed.<br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the distributor/wholesaler responsible to collect the $1.00 fee? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The distributor/wholesaler is responsible to collect the fee only from those retail dealers 
who do not have a valid Generator I.D. number </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: A tire manufacturer located in Ohio sells tires to the maintenance shop of a utility 
company through a local distributor. Who, if anyone, remits the $1.00 fee?<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: The $1.00 fee must be imposed by the dealer or distributor who is located in Georgia<br>
<br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can distributors and retail dealers deduct a &quot;handling&quot; fee for collecting and reporting 
the $1.00 fees? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Both distributors and retail dealers may deduct 3% of the first $3000 of the total 
amount of all fees collected and reported, and an additional .5% of that portion exceeding $3000 in 
fees collected and reported only if the fees and reports are not delinquent. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>Will the $1.00 fee be imposed on tires sold to manufacturers of automobiles, boat

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. The fee is to be imposed only on new replacement tires. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the $1.00 fee to be imposed only on passenger tires? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No; the fee is to be imposed on a variety of new replacement tires including tires for cars, 
trucks, motorbikes, aircraft, heavy equipment, ATV's, boat trailers and others. </p>
<hr align=left>
<h4><u>Carriers/Permits Issues</u></h4>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will a retail dealer, hauling its own scrap tires, be required to have a Carrier Permit? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How is the Manifest used if a Carrier picks up 100 tires, salvages 20 tires for reuse, 
then transports the remaining 80 tires to processors or landfills, etc.? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) Carrier becomes a processor during the sorting operation, and must be approved by EPD. 
(b)Carrier must initiate a second set of Manifests for the 80 scrap tires. The twenty (20) tires<br>
for reuse will not be manifested. <br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will Carrier Permits be permanent or renewable? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Permits will be permanent as long as financial assurance (Bond or Letter of Credit) is 
valid. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a fee for obtaining a Carrier Permit?<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer</strong>: No; however, a $5000.00 or $10,000.00 Bond or Letter of Credit is required and the 
insurance companies and banks usually charge an initial fee plus annual renewable fees. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will scrap tire carriers based in other states be required to have Carrier Permits? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes; whether they transport scrap tires into or out of Georgia<br>
</p>
<hr align=left>
<p><u>Generators/ID#'s Issues</u><br>
<br>
<strong>Question</strong>: Will city, county, and state vehicle maintenance shops be required to have ID Numbers 
and Carrier Permits? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: All governmental agencies must have a Generator ID Number if they generate scrap tires. <br>
They will not be required to have Carrier Permits in order to transport scrap tires. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong> : What is required of companies who have their own vehicle maintenance shops and 
generate scrap tires? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) Company must have ID Number as a Generator and manifest the tires to an approved state<br>
processing or disposal facility.<br>
(b) Company will not be required to have a Carrier Permit to transport its own company-generated 
scrap tires.<br>
</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will a large retail dealer chain be required to have an ID Number for each of its stores? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. ID Numbers are site specific, therefore, each store location must have its own ID#. </p>
<hr align=left>
<h4><u>Manifests Issues</u></h4>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will retail dealers be required to submit copies of scrap tire shipment manifests to the<br>
Environmental Protection Division? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. Copies of completed manifests should be maintained for three years by dealers, 
carriers, and processors, users or disposers. EPD inspectors may from time to time review these<br>
manifest files as part of the tracking system. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is a scrap tire Generator required to manifest used tires and retreadable casings? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Used tires and casings do not have to be manifested if they are pre-sorted prior to 
transport. If the tires are not pre-sorted, all must be manifested.<br>
</p>
<hr align=left>
<h4><u>General Issues</u></h4>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Which tire handlers have to keep records? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Retail dealers, generators, carriers, end users, processors and disposers must keep 
accurate records. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Who is required to report to the Environmental Protection Division (EPD)? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) Carriers must report annually the number and disposition of scrap tires.<br>
(b) Retail dealers must remit $1.00 for each new tire sold on a quarterly basis.<br>
(c) Processors must report quarterly the number of scrap tires processed.</p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How do used tire dealers fit into the Scrap Tire law? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><br>
(a) When mixed tires (scrap, used and recyclable casings) are picked up from the original 
generator, the used tire dealer must sign the Manifest as both the Carrier and the state-approved 
Tire Processor.<br>
<br>
(b) Used tire dealers who pick up tires, sort them, then transport scrap tires must have:<br>
1. ID# as a Generator/Processor of scrap tires<br>
2. Carrier Permit as a transporter of the scrap tires<br>
3. Initiate a second Manifest for the scrap tires that are sorted from recyclable casings and<br>
reusable tires (which are not considered scrap tires) </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is a tire Retreader required to have ID#'s or Permits? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <br>
(a) If only retreadable casings are transported to the retreader, Permits will not be required.<br>
(b) If a Retreader picks up scrap tires, salvages the casings, then transports <br>
rejects to a landfill or processor, he will be required to have a Scrap Tire Carrier Permit, be an<br>
approved state processor, and must initiate another manifest as a Generator. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will EPD provide lists of approved scrap tire carriers, processors, and disposers? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes; EPD will periodically provide updated lists of all three handlers. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will grants and loans for implementing innovative technologies for recycling be available 
to individuals or companies? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. </p>
<hr align=left width=50%>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How many tires can be stored at various facilities? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Different storage limits have been placed on scrap tire handling facilities as follows: <br>
1. Solid Waste Disposal sites - number to be approved by EPD<br>
2. Retail Tire Dealer - 3000 scrap tires<br>
3. Tire Retreader - 1500 scrap tires<br>
4. Auto Salvage Yard - 500 scrap tires<br>
5. Scrap Tire Sorter - 3000 mixed tires prior to sorting and 3000 scrap tires stored prior to<br>
transport<br>

<p> The Ecological Services Section is responsible for the
management of Georgia's marshes and beaches through permitting
and licensing, water quality monitoring, and coastal area
management programs. The Ecological Services Section was formed
in 1991 by combining the Marsh and Beach Section with the
Shellfish Sanitation Program of the Marine Fisheries Section. The
Section is coordinated through four primary programs: Coastal
Management Program, Enviromental Health Program, Habitat
Management Program, and Operations Program. These programs are
complimented by four federally-funded projects: Altamaha River
Watershed Project, Marina Pumpout Project, Section 401 Water
Quality Certification Assumption Project, and Wetlands Education
Project.</p>

<p> The <em>Marine Fisheries Section</em> has been an integral
component of Coastal Resources Division since its creation in
1978. Formerly the Coastal Fisheries Section under the Game and
Fish Division, the Section historically conducted management
activities (stock monitoring and regulatory actions) almost
exclusively in support of the state's multimillion dollar
commercial fisheries. In the 1970's the Section expanded its
focus into inshore and offshore recreational fisheries. The
offshore artificial reef program began in the early 70's,
followed by the initiation of ongoing life history and stock
assessment studies of Georgia's most important marine sportfishes
in the late 70's. With the transfer of the Section into the
Coastal Resources Division, these activities were continued as
activities of three more comprehensive Programs: <b>Outer
Continental Shelf</b>, <b>Recreational Fisheries</b>, and <b>Commercial
Fisheries</b>. An <b>Administrative Work Unit</b> provides
support sevices to these programs. </p>

<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>

<p> It is the mission of the Georgia Coastal Management Program
to balance economic development in Georgia's coastal areas with
preservation of natural, environmental, historic, archaeological,
and recreational resources for the benefit of Georgia's present
and future generations.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Georgia's Coast:</h3>

<p> Georgia has a beautiful coastal area with extensive marshes
and attractive beaches. Economic growth has been healthy and
Georgia's coast is a popular place to live, work, and visit. This
popularity, however, affects coastal resources and the overall
quality of life on the coast. Some of the activities in the
coastal area are not compatible. Conflicts and resource
limitations are already affecting coastal communities. Coastal
issues need to be addressed through a comprehensive management
program that considers all aspects of the coastal uses and
issues. Issues that are important to Georgia's coast include:
water supply limitations, identification of historic sites,
impacts to endangered species, beach erosion and hazard problems,
water quality degradation, declining fishery populations,
increased population growth, dredging and spoil disposal, lack of
beach access, and need for energy planning. As Georgia grows in
population, these issues will become more pressing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>History:</h3>

<p> In September 1992, Governor Zell Miller directed the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources Coastal Resources Division
(DNR-CRD) to develop a coastal management plan utilizing funding
available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management
(NOAA-OCRM). Before the plan was written, the DNR-CRD conducted a
thorough review of Georgia's existing laws and regulations and
concluded that Georgia could receive federal approval for a
coastal management plan based on existing authorities. Moreover,
DNR-CRD committed to developing a plan that would not result in
additional government bureaucracy. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Public Participation:</h3>

<p> To assist DNR-CRD in creating a coastal management plan,
Governor Miller appointed a 27-person Coastal Zone Advisory
Committee comprised of citizens from the coastal counties of
Georgia. Through the Coastal Zone Advisory Committee, nine public
task forces were organized to make policy recommendations to
DNR-CRD. Altogether, over 200 citizens were directly involved in
the development of the plan. An additional 1,428+ citizens
reviewed the plan and provided comment at public meetings,
hearings, and presentations. Public involvement has been and
continues to be crucial in the process of developing a coastal
management plan.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plan:</h3>

<p> The Georgia Coastal Management Program establishes a network
among agencies handling coastal issues, presents a comprehensive
framework for managing coastal resources, and promotes open
communication among the various parties with coastal interests.
Based on recommendations submitted to DNR-CRD by the citizen task
forces and the Coastal Zone Advisory Committee, the plan document
describes the significant assets of Georgia's coast, identifies
the problems and issues Georgia faces as its coastal region
continues to develop and grow, and provides the management
framework for resolving those issues. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Federal Approval:</h3>

<p> The federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 created a
voluntary program for states to develop and administer coastal
management programs. This Act set broad guidelines for state
programs and the criteria for approval. Individual states were
given the responsibility of identifying priority issues for their
respective coasts and implementing their program using state laws
and regulations. General concerns such as resources that affect
national defense and interstate transport must be addressed to
ensure that the management plan does not unduly hamper these
activities. The federal Coastal Zone Management Program provides
participating states with significant benefits, including federal
consistency, funding, and technical assistance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Current Activity:</h3>

<p> The issue of whether or not to pursue a federally-approved
coastal management program is currently up before a state
legislative study committee. The committee will meet Monday,
September 16, and Tuesday, September 17, to learn about the
proposed program, the benefits of federal approval for Georgia,
and the steps that would be necessary to enact a
federally-approvable coastal management program. This meeting is
open to the public. For more information, contact the Georgia
Coastal Management Program.</p>

<p> <strong>Shellfish Sanitation</strong></p>

<p> As mandated by state law (O.C.G.A. 27-4-197) the Department
of Natural Resources cooperates with the Department of
Agriculture to administer and operate a Shellfish Sanitation
Program sufficient to be certified by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The Department of Agriculture has the
responsibility for certification of handling facilities for
interstate shipments of shellfish in Georgia, which is included
in Part II of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP)
Manual of Operations. The DNR has responsibility for
classification and patrol of shellfish growing areas which
incorporates Part I of the NSSP Manual of Operations. The
Environmental Health Program (EHP) composes Sanitary Surveys for
the four growing areas in Georgia. </p>

<p> The EHP's efforts in shellfish sanitation represent the
foundation for the assurance of public health protection of
consumers of molluscan shellfish produced and harvested
commercially or recreational in Georgia. During each month the
EHP monitors shellfish growing waters and performs water quality
analyses using the Program's certified water quality laboratory.
The EHP also conducts extensive shoreline reconnaissance to
identify and evaluate all actual or potential pollution sources
that may affect the sanitary quality of a shellfish growing area.
Annually, water quality monitoring results and shoreline
reconnaissance data are incorporated into revisions and
comprehensive updates of these sanitary survey reports. The EHP
is evaluated each year by the US Food and Drug Administration to
measure compliance with NSSP requirements and is recognized as
having one of the strongest sanitation programs in the country. </p>

<p> The EHP also coordinates annual FDA evaluations of the patrol
element of DNR's Shellfish Sanitation Program by cooperating with
the Wildlife Resources Division, Law Enforcement Section. The
Georgia Shellfish Patrol Policy document, which is also a
requirement of the NSSP, is composed by the EHP and updated
annually or more frequently as required. The EHP manager is also
actively involved in the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation
Conference (ISSC) and Gulf and South Atlantic States Shellfish
Conference (GSASSC) each year. The ISSC is the annual forum for
development of national and international shellfish sanitation
policies for incorporation into the NSSP. The GSASSC is a
regional conference important for representation of regional
shellfish sanitation and shellfish resource management interests. </p>

<p> In addition to providing public health protection, the DNR's
shellfish sanitation program has historically played a
significant role in regulating the ever increasing demand for
coastal development in Georgia. &quot;Approved&quot; and
&quot;Restricted&quot; shellfish growing areas represent an
existing use under Section 404(b) of the Clean Water Act which
provides the DNR an avenue for input in the federal permitting
process to limit the environmental impacts associated with
various activities on the coast.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<strong>

<p>Resource Management</strong></p>

<p> The EHP also has a limited resource management function
through permitting of commercial harvest of shellfish production
in Georgia. The EHP issues Master Collecting Permits and
individual harvest permits to commercial industry members in the
state. The Environmental Health Program also administers leases
for exclusive rights to commercial harvest of shellfish resources
on state owned estuarine properties. There are currently three
state commercial shellfish leases which generate $2,275 in annual
fees which are returned to the program. Information regarding
entry into Georgia's shellfish industry is routinely distributed
to interested individual. The EH also manages approximately
20,000 acres of Public Recreational Shellfish Harvest Areas in
the six coastal counties. The EHP maintains approximately 100
signs identifying these areas and distributes charts marking the
locations to the general public upon request. As an added measure
of public health protection, the EHP also posts approximately 400
signs which identify locations unsafe for shellfish harvesting. </p>

<h1>Habitat Management Program</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Ecological Services Section</h2>

<p> <em>Program Manager: Terry West</em></p>

<p> E-mail <a href="mailto:terry@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us">terry@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us</a></p>

<p> <img src="art/island.gif"></p>

<p> The Habitat Management Program was established in July, 1994
as part of a reorganization of the Ecological Services Section.
The Program's function is to administer the mandated regulatory
responsibilities of the Coastal Resources Division: Coastal
Marshlands Protection Act (CMPA), Shore Protection Act (SPA), and
Revocable License Program. Staffing consists of a Program
Manager, two Permit Coordinators, and a clerical position to
administer the legally mandated authorities for the entire
coastal area: 100 miles of ocean-front beaches, 2344 linear miles
of coastline, and about 700,000 acres of marshlands and
waterbottoms. </p>

<p> Under the authority of these laws, the Habitat Management
Program conducts inspections to determine jurisdiction lines,
collect information, advise applicants and investigate
violations. Based on the recommendations of the staff, the
Coastal Marshlands Protection and Shore Protection Committees
issue or deny permits. </p>

<p> The Ecological Services Section is particularly concerned
with permitting projects that serve public interests on the
barrier islands. Examples of projects that require permits are
marinas, boat ramps, boardwalks and beach access crossovers which
protect the sensitive sand dune systems. </p>

<p> Accomplishment of these directives requires staff
coordination with federal, state, and local agencies;
consultation and negotiations with project applicants;
investigation of unauthorized and illegal activities;
determination of jurisdictional areas; and compliance inspections
of permitted projects. </p>

<p> The regulatory functions of the Ecological Services Section
have proven highly successful for a quarter of a century and are
recognized nationwide for this success. The General Assembly, in
legislating the CMPA and SPA, recognized the significant and
varied benefits of maintaining these fragile coastal habitats.
Sustainable populations of many species of marine life and
wildlife are dependent upon these habitats. Georgia's coastal
marshlands and beaches also provide recreation, serve as buffers
from natural storms, help control erosion and flooding, and
filter and disseminate pollutants. These habitats are therefore
vitally linked to the economy of not only the coastal area, but
to the entire state. </p>

<p> Due to the complexity of coastal geography and escalating
demands on the available resources due to population growth, the
management of our coastal habitats has become increasingly
complicated and controversial. Private property rights, public
access, water rights, economic growth versus resource protection,
and excessive governmental bureaucracy are but some of the
regulatory process issues at the forefront of the political arena
today. The regulatory functions of the Ecological Services
Section have for years been recognized for their flexibility to
balance development and conservation of vital estuarine habitat
areas. A primary goal of the Habitat Management Program is to
provide fair and equitable administration of the regulatory
functions while continually seeking to improve the efficiency of
service to the citizens of Georgia. </p>

<p> The Program has initiated changes in the past two years which
have aided attainment of this goal. In August 1994, the Program
assumed the revocable license program and marina waterbottom
leasing responsibilities from the DNR Real Estate Unit in
Atlanta. The Habitat Management Program's administration of the
revocable license authorities has received praise from the Corps
of Engineers, local governments, and citizens for reducing time
and providing efficient service to applicants. Several
administrative procedure changes were incorporated into the
revocable license process which reduced staff time and paperwork,
including the consolidation of five previous application forms
into one. The staff also meshed the revocable license process
with the CMPA and SPA processes, thus eliminating paperwork in a
step in the permitting process for applicants. With regard to the
marina waterbottoms leasing responsibilities, the provisions of
which are of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act, the staff
performed an initial analysis of the required procedures. This
analysis revealed a prime example of governmental bureaucracy -
duplicative efforts by different agencies, unnecessary paperwork,
unnecessary time delays in processing, and unnecessary costs to
applicants. The staff proposed legislative changes which were
approved by the 1995 General Assembly, signed by the Governor,
and took effect July 1, 1995. These changes not only simplify the
entire process and reduce processing time, but also provide the
lease fee proceeds to be retained by the Program instead of going
onto the general fund. </p>

<p> <img src="/CRD/art/lockness.gif"></p>

<p> The primary responsibility of the Operations Management
Program of the Ecological Services Section is the formulation of
Section operational objectives, the identificaiton and
procurement of objective funding sources, and the accomplishment
of those objectives through effective and efficient processes. In
periods of fiscal austerity, the function of the Operations
Management Program is particularly significant, since needed
improvement level projects must often be funded through sources
other than the State. Chief among the functions of the Operations
Management program is the identification and procurement of
alternative program funding sources. During the 1996 fiscal year,
the Operations Management Program procured five federally funded
projects totalling approximately $800,000. These federally funded
projects alllow the Coastal Resources Division to conduct
research, devise resources management plans, and acquire critical
habitat that would not be possible with state funding.
Applications are now in progress for six additional projects
totalling more than $1,000,000. </p>

<p> The Operations Management Program provides coordination,
supervision, and field assistance to federally funded and branch
projects not associated with other Programs. Current activities
include the implementation of a statewide Wetlands Training
Project for DNR law enforcement personnel, educators, and
officials of local government and development of a Joint General
Permit between the Georgia DNR and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Projects scheduled to commence in Fiscal Year 1996
include implementation of a partnership effort with The Nature
Conservancy to conduct an Altamaha River Watershed Demonstration
Project leading to increased protection of that ecosystem;
implementaiton of a Coastal Sediment Monitoring Project in
cooperation with the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography; and
continuation of the statewide Wetlands Training Initiative. </p>

<p> The Operations Management Program ensures continuous quality
emprovement in the Ecological Services Section by providing
on-going support to all section projects and activities. The
Operations Management Program provides on-going inservice
training and facilitates Section initiatives such as Strategic
Planning Efforts. The program provides budgetary planning,
oversight and control. The Program coordinates activities between
the Ecological Services Section and other Division programs such
as procurement and accounting. The Program also administers
Section accounting, purchasing, and inventory control processes.
In addition, the Program provides recruitment and other personnel
related services to the Section. </p>

<h1>Altamaha River Watershed Project</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Ecological Services Section</h2>

<p> <em>Janet Zimmerman, Marine Biologist</em></p>

<p> Email: <a href="mailto:janet@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us">
janet@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us </a></p>

<p> Phone: (912)264-7218 or (912)437-3066</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_bar.gif"></p>

<p> The Altamah system drains 19,400 km2 (7,760 mi2) of piedmont
terrain and 28,800 km2 (11,520 mi2) of coastal plain, making it
the largest drainage area east of the Mississippi River basin.
Undammed below the fall line, the Altamaha is unique among
watersheds in the eastern United States. The lower Altamaha
watershed, along the Altamaha River proper, boasta the highest
number of rare plants, animals, and natural community occurences
in Georgia. The lower Altamaha watershed also contains the
largest contiguos riparian corridor in the state, with floodplain
over 17 km wide in some areas. Nevertheless, somae areas are
logged to the riverbank, and multiple wetlands and other natural
communities are at risk. The relatively small number of
landowners in the lower Altamaha watershed, some of whom own
large tracts of land, offers great opportunity for protection of
wetlands via direct landowner negotiation.</p>

<p> The Watershed Protection Approach Demonstration Project
focuses on the lower Altamaha River watershed ecosystem and
expands efforts of the Georgia Department of natural Resources,
Coastal Resources Division, in cooperation with The Nature
Conservancy of Georgia, in protecting and preserving tidal and
nontidal wetland ecosystems throughout the state. The project
inventories and analyzes wetlnad and water quality data of the
Altamaha River via digitization and analysis of landcover, land
ownership, ecological significance, point source pollution, and
water quality layers on a Geographic Information System (GIS).
The project also classifies and ranks priority wetlands, provides
information which can be used by local decsionmakers, and is
working to design a wetlands protection protection strategy for
the watershed from the confluence to the ocean. In addition,
individualized maps and packets for landowners identifying
reources, expalianing the valua of those resources, and
describing protection options are being developed through the
project. The closing stage of the project will outline
contributions and applicability of the demostration project
methodology to other watersheds in Georgia and in the nation.</p>

<p> In this effort to manage Georgia's natural resources in a
sustainable manner, the following project objectives have been
identified:</p>

<p> 1) Develop a GIS database encompassing the Altamaha River
Watershed, including already collected data, landownership,
current management, landcover, and pollution sources for analysis
and use in coordinated planning, protection, and restoration
efforts. </p>

<p> 2) Conduct a landcover classification to be used for
watershed analysis, utilizing satellite imagery, field surveys,
and of the methodology developed by TNC in its national pilot
project. </p>

<p> 3) Analyze threats to the wetland resources, including
sources of stresses. </p>

<p> 4) Determine wetland protection priorities, through
correlation of areas of highest conservation interest and
concern, areas facing the greatest threats, and opportunities
based on landownership, land use, and regulatory jurisdiction. </p>

<p> 5) Develop a comprehensive system-wide protection plan for
the Altamaha River Watershed. This plan will:</p>

<p> a) identify and rank priority wetlands;</p>

<p> b) outline goals to protect priority wetlands;</p>

<p> c) survey existing conservation programs and regulations for
effectiveness;</p>

<p> d) develop wetland protection and management strategies;</p>

<p> e) identify potential restoration sites; </p>

<p> f) develop site conservation plans (tract-based) for high
priority wetlands, including a framework for acquisition,
conservation easements, management, and addressing cumulative
impacts and incremental loss;</p>

<p> g) summarize data analysis and report recommendations for use
by local governments, state and federal agencies, and regional
development centers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> 6) Produce maps and reports to facilitate meetings with
landowners and managers of high priority protection sites; </p>

<p> 7) Conduct meetings with private landowners of priority
wetlands, to discuss the uniqueness and importance of resources
under their ownership and appropriate management options, and to
identify and implement conservation strategies of their choice.</p>

<h3>Grant Program Development</h3>

<p> The purpose of this component shall be to plan and establish
a state grant program which will create criteria and processes
for awarding funds for the installation and renovation of pumpout
and/or dump stations in the six Georgia coastal counties. Current
data, including the 1995 Coastal Marina Survey will be analyzed
to determine areas in which the greatest needs exist. Target
areas will be identified according to boating density, number and
availability of pumpout or dump facilities, and habitat
considerations such as proximity to shellfish harvesting sites,
primary nursery areas, and water quality. </p>

<p> Based upon the analysis of survey data, marina facilities in
targeted, critical locations will be identified. Criteria for
awarding funds will be established. These elemental criteria will
include boating density, adequacy of facility, and availability
of other proximal pumpout or dump stations. Other priority
considerations may include installation of pumpout or dump
stations at fuel docks and other service areas which attract both
transient and local boaters, marinas and service facilities
catering to large numbers of transient boaters, marinas with wet
slips which cater to boats greater than 26 feet (pumpouts) or
less than 26 feet (dump stations), and marinas open to the
general public. A standardized funding application form will be
developed and completed for each facility requesting funding. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Pumpout/Dump Station Construction</h3>

<p> The purpose of this component shall be to implement the state
grant program from which funds will be awarded for the
installation and renovation of pumpout and/or dump stations in
the six Georgia coastal counties. Upon receipt of applications,
the Division will review proposed projects and grant awards based
upon prioritization of needs utilizing established criteria.
Prior to the close of the contract, pumpout or dump stations
installed or renovated will be inspected for proper installation
and operation. Based upon preliminary information generated by
the 1995 Coastal Marina Survey, three major construction projects
and five minor construction projects in coastal Georgia will be
completed during this funding period. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Public Information and Education</h3>

<p> The purpose of this component is to develop and implement a
coast-wide public education and information program designed to
build awareness of the problems associated with boat sewage and
encourage the use of pumpout and dump station facilities. The
component will also advertise the grant program and provide
information on the application process and selection criteria.
Working with private and public sector organizations, a directed
public education and information process will be developed. The
coast-wide outreach strategy will include development,
publication, and distribution of informational brochures and
materials aimed at the boating public and marine related
industry; development of a mobile display for use at boat shows
and other functions; development, publication, and distribution
of a boat sewage fact sheet; and inclusion of articles in the
public media and Departmental and Divisional newsletters and
other publications.</p>

<h3>EPA-funded State Wetlands Protection Grant Program, 7/1/96 -
6/30/99</h3>

<p> This grant seeks funding for a three-year program to continue
and expand the efforts of the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources, Coastal Resources Division to develop strategies for
the protection and preservation of existing tidal and non-tidal
wetland ecosystems within the six coastal counties. This effort
can serve as a model for enhanced wetland protection in the
inland portions of the State of Georgia as well as other states.
The proposed program is comprised of two primary developmental
components:</p>

<p> 1) Process development, transfer and assumption of the
Section 401 Water Quality Certification Program from the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division
to Coastal Resources Division in the six Georgia coastal
counties; and</p>

<p> 2) Process development, transfer and assumption of the
Regional General Permit for private, single-family, recreational
docks from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the Coastal
Resources Division within the GCMP area, incorporating current
Revocable License authrity. </p>

<p> The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The project will provide
the following wetlands protection and benefits:</p>

<p> 1. The project will improve and enhance State statutory
authority, regulations, and policies in regards to wetlands. The
Section 404 program will benefit from DNR/DRC assumption of 401
and dock GP and investigation of other NWP/GP/RP/ assumption
opportunities. Development of a GIS compatible electronic permit
tracking database system for compliance assessment, monitoring,
and enforcement will also improve the process. </p>

<p> 2. The project will improve State and Federal agency
coordination by integrating review processes between agencies and
eliminating duplicative programs to achieve more comprehensive
habitat protection. The proposal will involve coordination with a
variety of State (Environmental Protection Division, Coastal
Resources Division, etc.) and Federal (Corps of Engineers, EPA,
USFWS, NMFS, etc.) agencies to improve protection of wetland
resources. Compliance, monitoring, and enforcement will be more
efficient and coordinated as a result. The development process
will encourage the formal formulation and adoption of protocols,
rules, and guidelines for 401 certifications and conditions. </p>

<p> 3. The proposal will encourage consistency with the 404(b)(1)
guidelines. </p>

<p> 4. The proposal will enhance permit tracking, which will be
valuable in encouraging more vigorous compliance, monitoring, and
enforcement efforts, especially to newly-trained DNR conservation
rangers who will identify and report wetland violations. </p>

<p> 5. The proposal will identify and combine various programs,
resources, and recommendations into a strategy that could be
extended throughout the entire State of Georgia. </p>

<p> The proposed project accomplished the above stated benefits
through a collaborative effort between the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources, Coastal Resources Division; the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection
Division; and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District
in an effort to improve and streamline protection of wetlands in
the State of Georgia. </p>

<h3>EPA State Wetlands Protection Grant Program 7/1/94 - 6/30/96</h3>

<p> Thiis grant project improves state wetlands management
functions through the development of an in-service training
program which meets two designated goals. First, the in-service
training program enhances the capabilities of Georgia Department
of Natural Resources conservation officers to recognize and
report violations of federal and state regulatory laws and
permits designed to prevent the loss and degradation of wetlands
caused by erosion and sedimentaiton and non-point source
pollution. This project also &quot;trains-the- trainer&quot; by
providing Georgia's conservation officers with a wetlands
training program, including lesson plans, audio visuals,and
printed support materials, which they disseminate throughout the
state via presentations to various civic, school, and sportsmens'
groups. </p>

<p> An additional goal of the in-service training program is to
enhance understanding of the ecological value of wetlands and
wetlands protection of local government officials, educators, and
teachers in coastal counties by providing training and printed
support materials. In addition, this project enabled the
digitization and conversion of existing National Wetlands
Inventory maps of the six Georgia coastal counties for use in
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Utilizing the GIS aids
State and local governments in identifying wetlands; documenting
wetland alteration and conversion; and assist in conservation,
protection, and managment decision making. This project is
carried out through the Coastal Resources Division of the
Department of Natural Resources which is the sponsor of the
project and the primary contractor with EPA. The Coastal
Resources Division has sub-contracted portions of the project to
the Coastal Georgia Regional Development Center and to the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory.</p>

<p> The Outer Continental Shelf Program is comprised of five
associates (biologist, two wildlife/marine technicians, and two
research vessel crew). Program associates perform activities in
two primary areas: offshore research and surveys and offshore
recreational fisheries enhancement. Research and surveys
encompass an ongoing offshore bottom survey and life history
studies of offshore reef fishes important to Georgia. Enhancement
efforts entail artificial reef construction and maintenance. The
offshore bottom survey documents offshore bottom habitat
supporting recreational fishing opportunities and disseminates
this information through periodic publication of an updated, free
Georgia Offshore Fishing Guide. Survey results are imperative for
regional management decisions focused at protecting essential
reef fish habitat. The OCS Program's study of gag grouper is
providing critical information to state and federal fishery
managers on gag reproductive behavior/movement in order to avert
overfishing, possible stock collapse, or unnecessarily
restrictive regulatory measures impacting Georgia anglers. Among
the most popular of gamefish with Georgia anglers, gag grouper is
one of several reef fish species for which CRD has management
authority through O.C.G.A. 27-4-130.1 and Board of Natural
Resources Rules 391-2-4.</p>

<p> Offshore artificial reef development and maintenance
constitute the foundation of the OCS Program's recreational
fishing enhancement activities. Thirteen artificial reefs located
5 - 23 nm offshore have been constructed to provide safely
accessible offshore angling opportunities for Georgia anglers, as
well as to provide fisheries habitat necessary to enhance
valuable offshore fisheries. The OCS Program maintains thirteen
buoys to mark the offshore artificial reefs. These typically
large systems permitted through the U. S. Coast Guard not only
assist anglers in locating and utilizing the reefs but also
function as important navigational aids. The fishing
opportunities associated with artificial reefs translate into
direct economic benefits realized by businesses, coastal
communities and government. Direct expenditures by saltwater
fishermen in Georgia are estimated at $53.4 million annually,
with the total impact of Georgia's marine recreational fishing
industry estimated at $250 million annually.</p>

<p> While there is no mandate to construct artificial reefs, once
constructed, the State assumes short and long term responsibility
for each site under COE Regional Permit No. RP0036. There is no
mandate to buoy a reef once the site/obstruction has been
charted; however, while buoyed under USCG permit, there is an
obligation to maintain the aid.</p>

<p> The OCS Program maintains responsibility for the Georgia
Saltwater Gamefish Records Program. This activity recognizes
outstanding saltwater sportfish catches, promotes ethical angling
practices, provides data on saltwater species, and provides
anglers with a popular records program. The OCS Program Leader
represents Georgia on the SEAMAP -South Atlantic Board, which
establishes policy for this cooperative state/federal
fishery-independent data collection program targeting marine
fisheries resources of regional importance. Other miscellaneous
responsibilities of OCS Program associates include Altamaha
houseboat removal, recycling, and public relations cruises (which
will likely increase in FY96 with the new offshore R/V). Program
activities are supported by both State and non-competitive
Federal grant-in-aid funding sources.</p>

<p> The Marine Recreational Fisheries Program is comprised of
nine associates (four biologists and five hourly wage
technicians) who conduct research and surveys, and monitor stock
status of recreationally important saltwater sportfish.
Additionally, this unit is actively enhancing inshore marine
recreational fishing through boating and non-boating access
development and improvement, and inshore artificial reef
construction.</p>

<p> Four studies constitute the fishery independent research and
monitoring of Georgia's inshore sportfisheries: spotted seatrout
assessment, assessment of red drum exploitation and stock
structure, biotelemetry of young adult red drum, and assessment
of sub-adult red drum in the South Atlantic Bight. Because of
their status as Georgia's most popular inshore sportfish,
estuarine populations of spotted seatrout and red drum are
intensively monitored to determine exploitation and survival
rates as well as stock structure. Additional research emphasis is
attempting to better ascertain these parameters for immature red
drum, so as to improve the accuracy of stock assessments which
are the foundation for state, interstate and federal management
of this species. An ultrasonic tracking study which is
determining the spatial and temporal distribution of young adult
red drum in the spawning stock will conclude this fall. This
extensive fishery independent research provides scientific
information for state, interstate, and federal management of
these important sciaenids mandated pursuant to O.C.G.A.
27-4-130.1, Board of Natural Resources Rules 391-2-4, P.L.
94-265, and P.L. 103-206.</p>

<p> With increased saltwater angling consequent with Georgia's
expanding coastal populations, proactive management and quality
fishing experiences are essential for the resources and our
constituency (i.e. customers). Inshore marine recreational
fisheries enhancement activities entail access development for
boating and non-boating anglers, and improved fishing
opportunities through development of inshore artificial reefs.
The Recreational Fisheries Program is improving coastal fishing
for boating and non-boating anglers by constructing fixed and
floating docks at existing boat ramp sites coastwide.
Deteriorating ramps are targeted for repairs. Program associates
are contracting a cost effective conversion of an existing
shoreside structure into a public pier. Boating access
enhancement is mandated under the Federal Aid in Sportfish
Restoration Program (mandadatory 12.5% expenditure of State's
federal SFR funding). Boating access activities coupled with the
other non-mandatory development activities are extremely
beneficial economically ($250 million annually) to the local
coastal communities and the state overall.</p>

<p> Recreational Fisheries Program associates are engaged in a
number of exclusively State supported marine education
activities, including expansion of CRH Nature Trail resources,
hosting the annual parent-child fishing derby, and field
demonstrations and presentations to numerous school groups, civic
and conservation associations. Associates assist in the
collection of finfish samples for LCP-related contaminants
analyses (LCP is a superfund site located in the coastal zone of
Brunswick). A Program biologist performs law enforcement duties
in a pilot effort to expand coastal enforcement capabilities.
Recreational Fisheries Program associates actively liaison with
sportfishing clubs, and conservation organizations, academia, law
enforcement, and other state and federal agencies in their
research and management endeavors. Program biologists represent
the agency on six state/federal ASMFC and SAFMC work groups,
technical committees, and task forces, three of which are
associated with interstate and federal fishery management
programs, and as such, are federally supported. This involvement
is in fulfillment of agency obligations through the ACFCMA and
the Council Liaison Grant. Recreational Fisheries Program
activities are supported by both state and Federal funding
sources; Federal funds are both competitive and non-competitive
grant sources.</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> The Commercial Fisheries Program is comprised of 12
associates (three biologists, senior lab technician, three
research vessel crew, five hourly wage technicians) who are
actively engaged in research, monitoring and surveys associated
with management of Georgia's $25 million (dockside) crustacean
fisheries. Crustacean management involves ongoing monitoring of
shrimp and blue crab stocks utilizing a variety of gear aboard
CRD's Research Vessel ANNA and smaller craft to provide data for
season and area management decisions mandated pursuant to
O.C.G.A. Title 27. Shrimp trawl bycatch is currently being
analyzed during CRD's fishery independent crustacean assessment
study as well as during commercial food shrimping operations in
nearshore waters. Bycatch data are integral to enhanced finfish
stock assessments and necessary for evaluating and documenting
compliance with bycatch reduction essential to effective
interstate marine fishery resource conservation and mandatory
pursuant to the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management
Act of 1993.</p>

<p> Program professionals collaborate with Wildlife Resources
Division and National Marine Fisheries Service associates to
effect management strategies to minimize the interaction of
commercial trawl and gill net fisheries with endangered and
threatened species. The Commercial Fisheries Program is also
responsible for periodic collection of seafood samples from the
Purvis Creek/Turtle River closure area for contaminants analyses.</p>

<p> In conducting its activities, the Commercial Fisheries
Program manages for optimum yield, stock conservation, and
maintaining or restoring essential habitat quality. Achievement
of these goals is based on a foundation of management-oriented
research, monitoring and modeling, real-time decision making,
policy formulation, and development of legislative and regulatory
initiatives and recommendations to authorities responsible for
habitat quality and function. Program associates actively liaison
with citizens advisory groups, academia, conservation
organizations, law enforcement, and other state and federal
agencies in their research and management endeavors. Commercial
Fisheries Program biologists represent the agency on nine
interagency, state/federal, ASMFC, and SAFMC works groups,
technical committees, and task forces.</p>

<p> Commercial Fisheries Program associates also conduct numerous
public relations activities (e.g. 10 - 20 demonstration trawls)
for VIP's, agency and elected officials, conservation and service
organizations, and school groups throughout the year. Commercial
Fisheries Program activities are supported by both Federal and
State funding sources; Federal funds are both competitive and
non-competitive grant sources. </p>

<p> The Marine Fisheries Section's administrative unit is
comprised of five associates who provide policy, administrative,
clerical, budgetary, personnel and managerial support to a work
unit of approximately 30 associates. Federal-aid coordination,
regulatory compliance with interstate fisheries management plans,
and interjurisdictional fisheries management planning is
accomplished by the administrative team associates working in
concert with the Section's Program Leaders. Federal aid
coordination encompasses proposal and contractual preparation and
processing; budget formulation, monitoring, and amendments
preparation; and oversight of reporting compliance with grant
obligations for seven Marine Fisheries Section grants. Section
associates collaborate with the Section Chief in formulation of
regulations, legislation, issues papers and policy pertaining to
state, interstate, and state/federal marine fisheries management.
The unit serves as the state's principal link with the South
Atlantic Fishery Management Council and the Atlantic States
Marine Fisheries Commission. Unit associates perform a number of

<h1> Offshore Artificial Reef Development </h1>

Artificial Reef Guide</a></p>

<p> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Artificial Reef Development/Maintenance</h2>

<p> Continuing coastal development and growth has not only placed
more pressure on Georgia's marine fisheries, but also has created
a demand for increased angling opportunities. Direct expenditures
by saltwater fishermen in Georgia have been estimated at $53.4
million annually. With the number of anglers doubling since 1981,
the total impact of Georgia's marine recreational fishing
industry is now estimated at $250 million annually.</p>

<p> Georgia's continental shelf is characterized by mostly barren
sand bottom. Within this 4,000 square miles of ocean floor, only
an estimated 5% offers habitat for offshore gamefish. Creation of
manmade, or artificial, reefs is a proven management technique
that can significantly enhance the size and availability of fish
populations, as well as improve their accessibility to fishermen.
In 1970, the state of Georgia began a program designed to create
closer, safer offshore recreational fishing opportunities and
additional fisheries habitat. In further attempts to make the
offshore artificial more safely accessible to small vessels,
nearshore reef construction on six permitted sites 5-8 nm
offshore and adjacent to marked channels was initiated in 1989.
By 1996, construction had begun on five of the nearshore sites;
combined with the artificial reefs developed further offshore,
the number of offshore artifical reefs currently now totals 13
artificail reefs located 5- 23 miles offshore. Materials utilized
to construct the reefs include surplus vessels, tires, concrete,
and designed fishery enhancement units. Each reef is marked by a
state-maintained buoy.</p>

<p> In addition to providing additional recreational
opportunities and increasing fisheries habitat, properly
constructed artificial reefs also provide significant economic
benefits. Current estimates indicate that the thirteen offshore
artificial reefs constructed by DNR may generate an $5-7 million
annually, a significant return on a total construction investment
of approximately $1.5 million (federal &amp; state) over 26
years. For these reasons, a primary DNR goal is improvement and
expansion of coastal fishing opportunities through the
construction of a series of offshore, nearshore, and inshore
artificial reefs.</p>

<p> <em>Offshore/Nearshore Artificial Reef Development</em></p>

<p> Although only an estimated 15%-20% of the state's marine
recreational fishery in terms of total participants, Georgia's
offshore recreational fishery's economic impact is
disproportionately high. This fishery continues to expand due to
coastal development, the increased affordability of larger
boats/electronics, and the creation of an offshore artificial
reef system. This expansion, however, has also generated demands
for additional and more accessible opportunities similar to those
provided by Georgia's existing offshore and nearshore artificial
reefs.</p>

<p> Georgia's offshore artificial reef development program has
relied almost entirely on the availability of &quot;materials of
opportunity&quot;, such as donated/surplused vessels and scrap
concrete. Annual funding for the program has also been erratic
and insufficient. Both factors hinder the long-term planning
needed to conduct an effective offshore/nearshore artificial reef
development program coastwide.</p>

<p> In order to address the increasing demands of Georgia's
offshore recreational fishery, existing nearshore and offshore
artificial reefs need to be expanded and additional sites need to
be developed. Suitable materials of opportunity need to be
located and, if possible, barge/tug accessible staging sites must
be located for these materials. Construction components may have
to be designed and constructed, incorporating a variety of
materials. While staging/pre-placement preparations may be
conducted throughout the year, actual deployment operations
should occur, if possible, during the summer months to take
advantage of seasonally better weather/sea conditions.</p>

<p> <em>Offshore/Nearshore Artificial Reef Maintenance</em></p>

<p> Despite the availability and sophistication of today's
navigational electronics, Georgia anglers still rely and utilize
buoys placed and maintained by the state at the offshore
artificial reefs. Consisting of comparatively large buoy systems
to offer better visibility and resistance to dragging caused by
vessels illegally tying to the buoys, placement costs are
typically higher. Ongoing and emergency maintenance is required
throughout the year to ensure system integrity. Adequate
materials must be stockpiled to enable rapid replacement of buoys
lost to ship collisions, hurricanes, and other causes. Scoping
meetings conducted in 1996 regarding continued funding for
buoying of the offshore artificial reefs revealed strong support
in continuing buoying.</p>

<p> Permitted through the United States Coast Guard, the
state-maintained buoys help anglers locate and utilize the
offshore artificial reefs, as well as enhance safety by providing
important navigational backups. This is especially true for
smaller, less-equipped vessels, novice fishermen, and visitors.
The markers also provide visual delineation of the reef sites for
large vessels and, since many of the reefs are Special Management
Zones (SMZ), aid in enforcement efforts. Activities such as fish
trapping and trawling are prohibited on artificial reefs
designated as SMZ's</p>

<h1> Offshore Bottom Mapping Project</h1>

<h2>Offshore Bottom Survey</h2>

<p>Reef fish constitute one of the South Atlantic's most
important recreational and commercial offshore fisheries. A
primary factor affecting the distribution and extent of this
fishery is the occurrence of natural reefs, known off Georgia as
&quot;hardbottoms&quot; or &quot;live bottoms&quot;. North of
Florida, live bottoms reefs are scattered and are largely less
than 3' in relief, possibly subject to periodic inundation by
sand; off Georgia, the occurrence of live bottom on the adjacent
continental shelf is estimated at only 3-5% of the total area and
typically is found well offshore, beyond safe range of most
smaller boats. Without resources to effectively search for
additional nearshore opportunities, Georgia's offshore anglers
and divers heavily utilize the state's artificial reefs and known
live bottom areas and wrecks closer to shore. As a result,
fishing pressure has become concentrated and associated reef
fisheries have radically declined.</p>

<p> Management of the important South Atlantic reef fisheries in
large part relies on protection of the live bottoms throughout
the region. Without locational information, fisheries managers
lack the basic data needed to monitor reef fisheries and respond
to potential impacts associated with new gear types and offshore
mineral exploration.</p>

<p> In order to distribute fishing pressure, live bottoms,
wrecks, and other structures offering potential fishing
opportunities need to be defined and made available. Location of
these areas will better enable fisheries managers to monitor the
region's offshore reef fisheries and its habitat, as well as
enable improved response to overfishing and other potential
impacts.</p>

<h1> Offshore Finfish Monitoring Project </h1>

<h2> Outer Continental Shelf Program</h2>

<h3> Henry Ansley, Program Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Georgia's offshore marine recreational fishery encompasses an
array of finfish targeted by anglers, divers, and other user
groups. Of primary importance are the coastal pelagic
(&quot;mackerel&quot;) and snapper/grouper fisheries associated
with the offshore artificial and natural reefs. Less prominent
fisheries occurring offshore of Georgia include billfishes,
tunas, and sharks, as well as species more typically associated
with inshore fisheries, such as bluefish, red/black drum, and
sheepshead.</p>

<p> Offshore recreational landings data for Georgia are limited.
An independent, shelfwide assessment effort for Georgia is not
feasible. Regional charter surveys and habitat assessment efforts
are also limited and are not available for the nearshore/offshore
reefs frequented by fishermen. As a result, fisheries managers
must make decisions largely based on extremely limited or
incomplete data.</p>

<p> More offshore assessment data are needed to strengthen
existing stock assessments and formulate appropriate management
strategies. Ongoing regional assessment and surveys should be
suppplemented by DNR wherever possible. A limited finfish
monitoring program focusing on selected reefs could also provide
useful background on trends in relative abundances of offshore
finfish. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Stock Assessement / Life History</h2>

<p> <em>Snapper/Grouper</em></p>

<p> The South Atlantic Snapper/Grouper Fishery management unit is
made up of 73 finfish species, encompassing snappers, groupers,
porgies, sea basses, triggerfishes, jacks, and others. According
to the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), at
least 13 species are presently overfished, approximately 14
additional species are thought to be overfished, and more species
are expected to experience overfishing in the near future.
Included are several important gamefish popular with Georgia's
offshore anglers, such as gag/scamp groupers, red/vermilion
snappers, red porgy, greater amberjack, gray triggerfish, and
black sea bass. </p>

<p> Despite the existence of highly developed fisheries,
surprisingly little is known about the life histories of the
species making up the snapper/grouper complex. Baseline
information describing movement, spawning/aggregating behavior,
age structure, exploitation, and similar data is lacking. As
stated by the SAFMC (1991): &quot;Adequate management has been
hindered by lack of current and accurate biological, statistical,
social, and economic information. Data necessary to document
growth and/or recruitment overfishing...are very limited.&quot;
With only limited information, fisheries managers have
implemented creel and minimum size limits; harvest of some
species is now illegal. Future management measures now being
considered include, trip limits, limited entry, additional creel
limits and further seasonal/area closures and quotas.</p>

<p> Basic information on the snapper/grouper fishery off Georgia
is critically needed by South Atlantic management agencies. In
light of the scope of the work and the distribution of the
fishery, cooperative regional assessment and research efforts
constitute the most practical and cost-effective approach needed
to address this problem. Where possible, Georgia facilitates and
supplements South Atlantic research efforts, focusing on species
important to the state's offshore anglers, including gag, scamp,
red snapper, greater amberjack, black sea bass, and red porgy. </p>

<p> Working with South Carolina DNR and other regional agencies,
the Outer Continental Shelf Program is currently focusing on gag
movement and spawning aggregations, which are extremely
susceptible to overfishing. This study hopes to help determine
whether gag movement, possibly in response to spawning, is
inshore-offshore, southward/northward, or a combination of the
two.</p>

<h1> Inshore Artificial Reef Development </h1>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Inshore, popular gamefish are heavily targeted on well known
&quot;drops&quot;, primarily consisting of naturally occurring
oyster mounds and similarly encrusted structures that offer
habitat; however, these areas are limited throughout Georgia's
estuaries and are distant to many anglers. Further, many areas
offer only expanses of sand or mud bottom that will not support
oyster mound development due to the lack of needed hard
substrate.</p>

<p> Early experimentation in the late 1960's with inshore
artificial reef construction in Georgia was erratic until a more
recent program utilizing fabricated PVC/concrete structures was
initiated in the late 1980's. To date, four subtidal and seven
intertidal inshore reefs have been successfully constructed in
Georgia's estuaries, with the construction of an eighth reef
underway. The boundary of each reef is marked by corner pilings
and signs maintained by the state.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Inshore Artificial Reef Development/Maintenance</h2>

<p> As the trend for population expansion in coastal Georgia
continues, a greater number of people are taking advantage of the
waterways and natural resources Georgia has to offer. Boat
registrations in Georgia have increased 33% over the last ten
years. In the six coastal counties there is one registered boat
for every 15 people as compared to one in 24 residents statewide.
Creel and other fishery-dependent surveys indicate that this
increase means even greater fishing pressure on Georgia's inshore
marine recreational fisheries, the largest of the state's coastal
fisheries in terms of participants.</p>

<p> In an effort to disperse the fishing pressure and improve
fish stocks, inshore artificial reefs are needed to create more
habitat. Experimental reefs in St. Simons and Wassaw Sound have
demonstrated that inshore artificial reefs consisting of selected
materials and properly designed/sited are effective in creating
needed habitat. Presently restricted to two estuarine systems,
development of a coastwide system of small inshore artificial
reefs will help address the increasing angling pressure on
Georgia's inshore marine fisheries.</p>

<p> Georgia's inshore reefs are sited in shallow waters often
adjacent to navigational channels. The United States Coast Guard
requires clear designation of the reef sites. To accomplish this,
pilings marked with warning signs are placed at the periphery to
mark the boundaries of the inshore artificial reefs. Placement
and ongoing maintenance of additional systems will be necessary
with increased inshore artificial reef development.</p>

<h1> Access Enhancement </h1>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries Program</h2>

<h3> John Pafford, Program Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Increased marine-based recreational activity is associated
with Georgia's expanding coastal population. Consequently, one of
the primary goals of DNR's strategic planning initiatives is to
improve coastal fishing by improving existing boating and
non-boating access as well as construction of additional access.
Construction of fixed and floating docks at existing boat ramps
sites is needed coastwide to serve non-boating anglers, as well
as the boating public. Ramps with floating docks greatly enhance
the boat launching activities by improving safety and reducing
the risk of boat, trailer, and vehicle damage. Many of Georgia's
coastal boat ramps need repairs to enable adequate access at low
tide. In addition, new ramps are needed due to growing coastal
populations and increasing tourism.</p>

<p> Georgia's 100-mile coast includes more than 2,400 miles of
tidal creeks and rivers; 8,000 square miles of continental shelf;
374,000 acres of tidal marsh; and 184,000 acres of tidal waters.
Residents and tourist alike seek shore-based access to these
saltwater resources for fishing, crabbing, and castnetting.
Because of limited time most coastal residents and visitors have
to fish, they depend on easy access. In addition, lower income
families are largely dependent on non-boating angling access.</p>

<p> Despite this demand and the magnitude of the resources,
shore-based access is limited since most creeks and rivers are
typically separated from high ground by large expanses of
saltmarsh. Further, most suitable high ground adjacent to
saltwater creeks and rivers is privately owned (and highly
valued). For these reasons, public piers are critically needed
coastwide to allow citizens reasonable access to common property
resources.</p>

<p> The benefits of improved angler access and marine
recreational fishing in general are well documented. In the past
10 years, the number of participants in Georgia's marine
recreational fishery has significantly increased with
approximately a half million anglers participating during 1994.
Boat registrations in Georgia have increased 33% since 1981. In
the six coastal counties there is one boat registered for every
15 people as compared to one in 24 statewide. The total economic
impact of saltwater recreational fishing is estimated at more
than $250 million annually. Adequate boating and non-boating
access results in quality fishing trips which translates into
economic benefits to the local coastal communities and the state
overall.</p>

<p> Georgia enjoys a good reputation among saltwater anglers.
Regional estimates indicate that Georgia's anglers, on the
average, land more spotted seatrout than those in South Carolina,
North Carolina, and Northeast Florida combined. This is due, in
part, to effective management of the State's marine fishery
resources. Georgia's coastal population has increased 12% in the
past decade with angling effort reaching unprecedented levels.
Only through progressive fishery management based on
comprehensive and accurate information will quality saltwater
fishing opportunities be perpetuated.</p>

<p> Including stock assessement and life history studies,
research and fishery-independent surveys provide information on
exploitation rates, annual survival, movement, growth, age
composition, reproductive biology, stock structure, and general
health of fish populations. Presently, this information is only
being collected for spotted seatrout and red drum in two of
Georgia's ten estuarine systems per year. </p>

<h1> Angler Education</h1>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries Program</h2>

<h3> Spud Woodward, Project Leader</h3>

<p> </p>

<h2>Angler Education</h2>

<p>Coastal Georgia is blessed with abundant and diverse estuarine
and marine fishery resources. Georgia's 100-mile coastline
includes more than 2,400 miles of tidal creeks and rivers; 8,000
square miles of continental shelf; 374,000 acres of tidal marsh;
and 184,000 acres of tidal waters. This environment serves as
habitat to a myriad of marine and estuarine finfish, crustaceans,
shellfish, marine mammals, and sea turtles that are of
recreational, commercial, and nonconsumptive importance to
Georgians and visitors to the state's six coastal counties.</p>

<p> Rapid population and urbanization of Georgia's coastal area
has led to the deterioration of estuarine/marine habitats and
stressed those natural resources dependent on them. Increased
fishing pressure has also stressed numerous marine and estuarine
living resources. The public must be educated about the value and
need for protecting essential fishery habitats from developmental
encroachments and the damaging effects of pollution. Education
about conservation of sportfish resources is another important
element in a public marine education program. A conservation
ethic needs to be instilled in the citizenry, young and old, to
maintain the quality of our marine and estuarine resources for
present and future generations.</p>

<p> Major objectives of a Marine Education Program for the next
five years are: l) promoting and enhancing the public's
understanding of and appreciation for marine resources and
environments; 2) implementing long-term educational strategies
targeting youth and adults and pertaining to marine sportfish
conservation, restoration, and utilization; 3) cultivating a
stewardship ethic for common property resources among marine
resource users; and 4) generating more responsible marine
fishermen through training in the understanding of marine
resource management techniques.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Sportfish Research Video</h2>

<p>A key to conserving the State's marine resources for current
and future generations is the education of Georgia's populace.
Georgia's coastal region and associated living resources and
ecosystems are a treasure yet to be discovered and enjoyed by
much of its citizenry. Implementation of a comprehensive marine
education program targeting youth and adults would educate
Georgians about the state's valuable, unique living coastal,
marine, and estuarine resources and habitats, as well as the need
to conserve these valuable resources and the management
techniques required to accomplish this.</p>

<p> Coastal Resources Division plans to develop a video on
Georgia sportfish research and management to promote better
understanding of how fisheries information is gathered, life
histories of selected sportfish species, and regulatory
approaches to management of sportfish species. This will help
generate a populace (youth and adults) with a greater
appreciation of the marine environment, fishery resources,
conservation principles and ethics, and the knowledge necessary
to advocate management of their resource for the present and the
future. </p>

<h2>MEASURING SALTWATER FISH</h2>

<p> Length, creel, and seasonal limits are being used to manage
saltwater finfish in coastal Georgia. Many anglers, particularly
novices, find these harvest regulations somewhat confusing. For
instance, in freshwater, anglers measure most fish using a total
length method. However, in saltwater, fish are measured using a
variety of techniques. A spotted seatrout, which has a deeply
forked and rigid tail, is measured using the fork length
technique. A billfish, such as a sailfish, is also measured using
the fork length technique; however, the measurement is taken from
the tip of the lower jaw to the fork of the tail. In many cases
finfish which have rigid forked tails will suffer damage to their
tails during transport from offshore fishing grounds.
Consequently, if all saltwater fish were measured using the
method, the angler might find themselves in a situation where the
fish they caught was legal, but when that same fish was measured
by a wildlife officer at the dock it would not be the same
length. Therefore, fishery managers have formulated length
regulations based on specific characteristics of the different
saltwater fish.</p>

<h1>Safe Boating</h1>
<em>

<p>BOATING SAFETY ZONES</em></p>

<p> The following areas have been designated as boating safety
zones and it is unlawful to operate a power boat within areas 1
through 4 below, and any boat within areas 5 and 6 below. Area 7
pertains to motors in excess of 10 horsepower.</p>

<p> 7. Motors in excess of 10 horsepower are prohibited on the
Ogeechee River from the bridge at Georgia Highway 119 upstream.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>Trailer Launching Boats</em><p. georgia's coastal creeks and
rivers consist primarily of mud and sand bottoms. with the
current velocities produced by daily tides ranging from 6 to 8
feet, this type of substrate often gives way to erosion problems
which may create a steep drop-off at the foot of many boat ramps.
therefore, boaters should take caution when launching boats
during low tide periods to insure that adequate ramp surface
extends out far enough to safely back trailers when launching
boats. <p> <em>Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs)</em></p>

<p> Personal flotation devices are an important safety item and
should be carried aboard all boats. PFDs, one for each passenger,
are required on all boats. Regulations may differ among states so
be sure to check state requirements.</p>

<p> There are several types of PFDs including:</p>

<p> 1. Life Preservers (Type I) are designed in such a way that,
even if injured or unconscious, the wearer's face remains out of
the water. Type I is the most effective for long exposure in
rough water.</p>

<p> 2. Buoyant Vests (Type II) are designed to turn an
unconscious person face up or slightly backward in the water.</p>

<p> 3. Special Purpose Devices (Type III) are designed so a
conscious person can float in a vertical or slightly backward
position and keep their head above water.However, the Type III
PFD has little or no turning ability and may not turn an
unconscious person upright in the water.</p>

<p> 4. Throwable Devices (Type IV) are designed to throw to
people in the water. Type IV PFDs do not give protection
available from a wearable type device.</p>

<p> 5. Restricted Special Purpose Device (Type V) is any PFD
approved by the U.S. Coast Guard for restricted use on vessels
used for a specific activity such as canoeing, rafting, kayaking,
sail boarding, or for commercial uses. Typically an inflatable,
wearable device.</p>

<p> <em>U.S. Coast Guard Regulations for PFDs</em></p>

<p> 1. Boats sixteen (16) feet or over in length must be equipped
with one Type I, II, or III (Wearable PFD) for each person on
board or being towed on water skis, plus one Type IV (Throwable)
in case someone falls overboard.</p>

<p> 2. Boats less than sixteen (16) feet in length, and all
canoes and kayaks, must be equipped with one Type I, II, or III
PFD for each person on board or being towed on water skis, etc.</p>

<p> 3. A Type V PFD may be carried in lieu of any PFD, but only
if the Type V PFD is approved for the activity in which the boat
is being used. U.S. Coast Guard approved inflatable, wearable
device.</p>

<p> Any person being towed on water skis, aquaplane, surfboard or
any similar device is required to wear a ski belt, ski jacket, or
a Type I, II, or III U.S. Coast Guard approved personal
floatation device.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>Fire Extinguisher</em></p>

<p> Fire on a boat is one of the skipper's greatest fears and one
of the major causes of damage to boats. For protection all boats
should carry fire extinguishers approved by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Fire extinguishers must be readily accessible, and must at all
times be kept in condition for immediate and effective use.</p>

<p> Fire extinguishers are classified by letters and numbers
according to the type and size fire they can put out. The letter
indicates the type of fire: &quot;A&quot; for combustible solids
like wood; &quot;B&quot; for flammable liquids; and &quot;C&quot;
for electrical fires. The following fire extinguishing materials
can be used to put out various types of fire on boats:</p>

<p> Fire Extinguisher Type Type Fire Carbon Dioxide (CO2) (A,B,C)
Halon/Freon (A,B,C) Dry Chemical (B,C) Foam (B) Water (A)</p>

<p> Some boat fires involve burning wood and paper and can be put
out with water. Do not use water on gasoline, oil, or electrical
fires! Water will cause a gasoline or oil fire to spread or cause
an electrical shock. Adequate fire extinguishers must be aboard
vessels mechanically-propelled according to the size- class of
the vessel. In Georgia, the fire extinguisher requirements for
each boat size- class are as follows:</p>

<p> When No Fixed Fire When a Fixed Fire Boat Boat Extinguisher
System Extinguisher System Class Length (ft) In Engine Space
Installed In Engine Space A Less than 16 One B-I None 1 16 to 26
One B-I None 2 26 to 40 Two B-I or one B-II One B-I 3 40 or more
Three B-I or one B-I Two B-I or one B-II and one B-II CARBON DRY
EXTINGUISHER FOAM DIOXIDE CHEMICAL FREON (Type-Size) (Min Gals)
(Min Pounds) (Min Pounds) (Min Pounds) B-I 1 1/4 4 2 2 1/2 B-II 2
1/2 15 10 -</p>

<p> Open runabouts of Class &quot;A&quot; and Class &quot;1&quot;
shall not be required to be equipped with fire extinguishers
provided the construction of such vessel will not permit the
entrapment of explosive or flammable gases or vapors.</p>

<p> Extinguishers should never be tried merely to see if they are
in proper operating condition because in many cases the valves
may not properly reseal, resulting in a gradual discharge of the
extinguishing agent. After using an extinguisher, recharge it as
soon as possible and before using the boat again.</p>

<p> <em>Ventilation</em></p>

<p> Regulations require ventilation of all closed engine and fuel
tank compartments if gasoline is used for fuel. Exhaust blowers
are installed in engine compartments so that gasoline fumes can
be removed before engines are started. Gasoline vapors can
explode if engines are started before blowers are allowed to
operate for four (4) minutes to remove fumes.</p>

<p> <em>Whistles and Horns</em></p>

<p> All boats should carry some type of sound-producing equipment
for signaling. Sound-producing equipment may be needed for
emergencies, fog or heavy rain conditions, or maneuvering in
heavy boat traffic. In Georgia, every boat 26 feet in length or
longer must be equipped with a whistle, horn or other
sound-producing mechanical appliance capable of producing sounds
which would warn approaching vessels of your presence.</p>

<p> <em>Lights</em></p>

<p> Any boat used between sunset and sunrise must show the lights
required by law. Failure to show necessary lights is one of the
leading causes of fatal accidents in Georgia. Remember, the motor
noise of your vessel makes it almost impossible to hear a vessel
approaching, and lights are the only way to locate a moving
vessel during hours of darkness. Even though you may not plan to
use your boat after sunset, you should have the required lights
installed for your protection. Lighting requirements will vary
according to boat size and design.</p>

<p> <em>Mirrors</em></p>

<p> All boats used for towing persons on skis, aquaplanes,
surfboards, or similar devices are required to be equipped with a
wide angle mirror or else have some person, other than the
operator, who is competent to constantly observe the person being
towed.</p>

<p> <em>WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT</em></p>

<p> The Georgia Boat Safety Act requires the operators of all
vessels involved in accidents to render such assistance as may be
practical and necessary, insofar as can be done without serious
danger to their own vessel, crew and passengers.</p>

<p> Operators of vessels involved in accidents are also required
to give their name, address, and identification of their vessel
in writing to any person injured and to the owner of any property
damaged.</p>

<p> Persons who render the aid required by law, and who
gratuitously and in good faith render assistance at the scene of
a vessel accident may not be held liable for any civil damages as
a result of the rendering of assistance, as long as such
assistance is rendered in a prudent manner.</p>

<p> A reportable boating accident is any accident which results
in loss of life or disappearance, injury sufficient to require
first aid or medical attention, or damage to vessels or other
property in excess of $500.</p>

<p> <em>SURVIVAL IN THE WATER</em></p>

<p> You may fall overboard or be forced into the water from a
boating accident. Don't panic or fight the water. Swim slowly and
easily to conserve strength. Hang onto the boat unless it is in
danger.</p>

<p> Any item that floats will help keep you afloat. In a fire or
explosion, throw anything that floats overboard. Tie a rope to
the floating gear to hold on to. If the boat is on fire you can
then float a safe distance away and not lose the boat. Floating
debris is easier to see than one person in the water.</p>

<p> Clothing can preserve body heat and help you float. Take it
off only if it hampers movement. Fasten clothing around your neck
to trap air. Keep your arms under water. If wearing trousers,
bend your legs to hold the air in around your knees. Fishermen
can use the air which is trapped in their boots to keep them
afloat.</p>

<p> You may begin to loose body heat through hypothermia. Don't
discard clothing if water is cold, clothing helps trap the body's
heat. Thrashing around in cold water only leads to exhaustion and
swirling water takes heat from the body more rapidly than still
water. If several people are in the water, huddle closely
together or if alone, fold your legs to your chest and remain as
still as possible. If you are exhausted or losing consciousness,
tie yourself to anything that floats. </p>

<p> <em>ALCOHOL ON BOARD</em></p>

<p> For many people, beer is the boat's most important cargo.
Depending on the amount consumed, alcohol can add to the day's
enjoyment or be the cause of a tragedy. It is everyone's
responsibility to control on-board drinking. The easiest way to
avoid excessive drinking is to limit the amount of alcohol you
bring on board.</p>

<p> Drinking, combined with fatigue due to glare and constant
boat motion, causes accidents. Alcohol affects balance and muscle
coordination and causes tunnel vision and inability to track
moving objects. Excessive drinking slows reaction time, increases
the tendency to take risks, and affects reasoning. People who've
had too much to drink lose the ability to judge the effects of
alcohol. Any behavior that is unusal for a particular passenger
is a danger sign (i.e. loud talking, slurred speech, clumsy
behavior, dropping or spilling things, etc.). Help insure for a
safe and enjoyable boating trip by limiting the drinking of any
person on board who shows these signs. </p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>RUNNING AGROUND</em></p>

<p> Tides levels in Georgia typically range as high as 8 feet.
Such changes in water level increases the chance of running
aground. As in all emergency situations the first thing to do is
keep calm. Usually, the first impulse is to shift immediately
into reverse, gun the engine, and attempt to back up. This could
be the wrong move. The propeller spinning in reverse may pull
more sand and mud under the keel making matters worse. Also,
continued operation may clog the cooling system with sand or mud
and cause your motor to overheat.</p>

<p> Instead, tilt up your motor. With an oar or paddle test the
bottom all around the boat. If the bottom is shallow and sandy
and it is safe to do so, get a couple of people out of the boat
and push it off. You might get results by having your passengers
move and shift their weight gently rocking the boat while it is
being pushed. Remember, with 6 to 8 foot tides, the water level
may be rapidly falling and you may have only minutes to free your
boat before it is totally grounded high and dry. For your boating
safety, it is highly recommended that you obtain a navigational
chart and study your boating area. Many coastal marinas sell
navigational charts or can tell you where to purchase one.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>BOAT RAMP ETIQUETTE</em></p>

<p> Launching a boat can sometimes be a problem. Wind, low tide,
a slippery, steep boat ramp or other local problems may mean
hidden hazards. The boat owner can make the task easier by being
alert and following this simple procedure. Remember, courtesy and
efficiency will go a long way in making a boat trip a pleasure
for you and others too.</p>

<p> Before you get in line to launch your boat, do the following:</p>

<p> 1. Stay to one side and watch one or two launchings to notice
any problems on the ramp and the effects of wind and current on
launching. Many boat ramps in Georgia's coastal waters may have
steep drop-offs at the foot or end of the ramp. Caution should be
taken during lower tide levels.</p>

<p> 2. Remove any gear that is stored in the car. Rig and prepare
boat supplies and equipment for full operation.</p>

<p> 3. Disconnect the wiring plug between car and trailer.</p>

<p> 4. Remove tie-downs. Insure trailer winch is locked and winch
line connected to bow eye. Double check to make sure that the
drain plug is in.</p>

<p> 5. Attach a line to a bow cleat and a second line to a stern
cleat to aid in controlling the boat after launching.<p. 6. double
check engine safety chains and make sure that the outboard is
securely attached to the transom.<p> 7. Insure that all
passengers are out of the car and in a safe area away from areas
of moving vehicles and trailers.</p>

<p> 8. Back down into the water until the rear rollers or
supports are barely under the water. 9. Have someone guide you
into the water and hold onto the guide lines which you connected.</p>

<p> 10. Disconnect the winch line from the bow eye and put the
boat in the water.</p>

<p> 11. Move your boat so others may launch.</p>

<p> 12. Return your vehicle and trailer to the parking area.</p>

<h1>RECOMMENDED FISHING METHODS</h1>

<p> Many fishermen from non-coastal counties, especially those
from out-of-state, may possess limited knowledge of saltwater
fishing techniques and may be unfamiliar with Georgia's
indigenous marine sport fish species. Recreational saltwater
fishing is excellent in Georgia and every year, large numbers of
spotted seatrout, red drum, black drum, sheepshead, flounder,
whiting, spot and croaker are taken. However, anglers fishing in
unfamiliar waters that exhibit 6 to 8 foot tides may find
difficulty in learning the proven techniques necessary for
producing a good fishing experience.</p>

<p> The following recommendations are intended to provide
information on basic fishing techniques for some common sport
fish found in Georgia's coastal waters. Also, daily information
on what's biting can be obtained from most coastal marinas or
local fishing equipment and bait outlets. Phone numbers for
marinas and fish camps are provided in the county map section.</p>

<p> <em>SPOTTED SEATROUT</em></p>

<p> The most commonly used method for seatrout is drift fishing a
standard deep floating terminal rig baited with live shrimp. When
fishing with a float rig, most anglers use bait casting reels
with rods eight feet or longer. Seatrout are typically mid-water
striking feeders. Live bait such as shrimp, finger- size mullet,
mud minnows, and menhaden (pogies) are recommended. Although live
shrimp are considered the best year-round bait for seatrout, from
mid-November through March when water temperatures cool,
artificial lures such as plastic tail grubs work just as well and
oftentimes better. Fishing tackle for artificial lures usually
consists of light spinning or spin cast reels spooled with 8-10
pound line and rods six feet or longer. A number of inexpensive
lures resembling small fish may be purchased at marinas or tackle
shops. When fishing with lures, retrieve the line as slowly as
possible, allowing the lure to occasionally touch bottom.</p>

<p> Seatrout are basically schooling fish in areas with large
quantities of dead oyster shell, or near live oyster beds. They
prefer fringe areas adjacent to banks, points, jetties and bars,
but are also taken in deeper channels during cold water winter
periods, or along open waters of the beaches during spring and
summer.</p>

<p> <em>RED DRUM (Spottail Bass)</em></p>

<p> The most commonly used method for red drum fishing is a
standard deep floating terminal rig baited with live or dead
shrimp or small crabs. Although school-size red drum can be
caught year-round in inshore estuarine waters, young-of-the-year
red drum typically show up in June-August. However, fall is the
best time to catch small school-size drum. Fishing for young red
drum (<15 lb) employs the same basic tactics, gear, and areas used
to catch spotted seatrout. in addition to shrimp and fiddler
crabs, many anglers often use live finger-size mullet or mud
minnows to target medium-size red drum (5 15 lb) found on open
mud flats adjacent to large expanses of salt marsh grass. mud
minnows and small mullet may be easily collected with two-funnel
minnow traps baited with bread or a piece of fat-back bacon and
set in a tidal ditch. if the trap is left unattended for an
extended period of time, insure the area will have adequate water
depth during low tide. <p> Angling for large red drum is strictly
a surf fishing proposition. Surf fishing requires a long surf rod
for long distance casting. Most anglers use 30 pound test
monofilament line and terminal rigs consisting of 4 to 8 oz.
pyramid or egg sinkers or 3 to 4 oz. storm sinkers rigged as a
fish-finder rig with 7/0 to 9/0 standard hooks. However, with
recent size regulations requiring the release of the large-size
drum, 12/0 to 14/0 circle hooks are highly recommended. Circle
hooks are self-setting which generally results in more hook-ups
and the circle hook generally hooks in the mouth region thus
greatly reducing &quot;gut-caught&quot; drum. The most popular
bait is fresh-cut mullet and blue crabs for targeting large
(&gt;20 lb) red drum. Fish for large drum in the spring and fall
in heavy surf near inlets.</p>

<p> <em>BLACK DRUM, CROAKER and SPOT</em></p>

<p> These bottom feeders are some of the most numerous and easily
caught fish and are usually taken with a &quot;fish finder&quot;
or &quot;bottom rig&quot; baited with shrimp or fiddler crab.
They are primarily estuarine fish, abundant in Georgia's inshore
waters from April to October. Concentrations of black drum are
often found near piers, docks, jetties, bridges and areas of
naturally occurring oyster shell mounds. Croakers prefer sandy
hard bottom while spot prefer firm mud and clay bottom.</p>

<p> <em>SHEEPSHEAD</em></p>

<p> Usually found around docks, piers, jetties, and other
structures encrusted with barnacles and oysters, the sheepshead
is notorious for its ability to steal bait from the novice
angler. The recommended sheepshead rig consists of an 1/2 oz. egg
sinker, 8 to 10 inch leader, and 1/0 or 2/0 hook baited with a
fiddler crab. Hook the fiddler by inserting the barb of the hook
between the walking legs leaving the barb inside the crab.
Fiddler crabs may easily be obtained by hand from marsh sand
flats located along island causeways.</p>

<p> After lowering the baited hook to the bottom next to a piling
or encrusted structure, immediately take the slack out of the
line and very slowly raise and lower the baited hook. The least
amount of resistance or rod tip vibration should be considered a
bite. After reeling in the line and only the carapace or shell of
the fiddler crab remains on the hook, the angler will readily
appreciate the skill of this king of bait stealers. The angler
should never give up, only patience and time will provide the
necessary skills to catch the elusive sheepshead.</p>

<p> <em>FLOUNDER</em></p>

<p> Usually found in the more open flat bottom areas where
spotted seatrout and red drum concentrate, flounder are generally
caught incidentally with seatrout and red drum on standard float
rigs with live shrimp. Anglers specifically targeting flounder
also use bottom rigs consisting of a small egg sinker, swivel, 18
to 24 inch leader, and a 3/0 Kahle hook baited with active live
shrimp, mud minnows, or finger-size mullet. </p>

<h1>CATCH AND RELEASE</h1>
<em>

<p>Why Release Fish</em></p>

<p> 1. Stressed fish populations need your help to recover.</p>

<p> 2. A personal commitment to conservation adds fun to fishing.</p>

<p> 3. Size, season, and bag regulations make release mandatory.</p>

<p> 4. A fish is too valuable a resource to be caught only once.</p>

<p> 5. The future of sportfishing is in your hands. Pass it on!</p>

<p> <em>How To Begin</em></p>

<p> 1. Use hooks that are barbless and made from metals that rust
quickly. May use pliers to flatten barbs on hooks.</p>

<p> 2. Set the hook immediately. Try to prevent a fish from
swallowing the bait.</p>

<p> 3. Land your quarry quickly; don't play it to exhaustion.</p>

<p> 4. Decide to release a fish as soon as it is hooked.</p>

<p> 5. Work a fish out of deep water slowly, so it can adjust to
the pressure change.</p>

<p> 6. Always keep release tools handy.</p>

<p> <em>Handling Your Catch</em></p>

<p> 1. Leave the fish in the water (if possible) and don't handle
it. Use a tool to remove the hook or cut the leader.</p>

<p> 2. Keep the fish from thrashing.</p>

<p> 3. Net your catch only if you cannot control it any other
way.</p>

<p> 4. When you must handle a fish:</p>

<p> Use a wet glove or rag to hold it.</p>

<p> Turn a fish on its back or cover its eyes with a wet towel to
calm it.</p>

<p> Don't put your fingers in the eyes or gills of your catch.</p>

<p> (Larger fish can be kept in the water by holding the leader
with a glove or by slipping a release gaff through the lower
jaw).</p>

<p> Avoid removing mucous or scales.</p>

<p> Get the fish back in the water as quickly as possible.</p>

<p> 5. Protect against personal injury by handling each species
carefully and correctly.</p>

<p> <em>Removing the Hook</em></p>

<p> 1. Cut the leader close to the mouth if a fish has been
hooked deeply or if the hook can't be removed quickly.</p>

<p> 2. Back the hook out the opposite way it went in.</p>

<p> Use needle-nose pliers, hemostats, or a hookout to work the
hook and protect your hands.</p>

<p> 4. For a larger fish in the water, slip a gaff around the
leader and slide it down to the hook. Lift the gaff upward as the
angler pulls downward on the leader.</p>

<p> 5. Do not jerk or pop a leader to break it. This damages
vital organs and kills the fish.</p>

<p> <em>The Final Moments</em></p>

<p> 1. Place the fish in the water gently, supporting its
mid-section and tail until it swims away.</p>

<p> 2. Resuscitate an exhausted fish by moving it back and forth
or tow it alongside the boat to force water through its gills.</p>

<p> 3. Use an ice pick, needle, or hook point to puncture the
expanded air bladder on a fish taken from deep water.</p>

<p> 4. Watch your quarry to make sure it swims away. If it
doesn't, recover the fish and try again.</p>

<p> 5. Remember, a released fish has an excellent chance of
survival when handled carefully and correctly.</p>

<h2>WHOSE FISH ARE THEY, ANYHOW?</h2>

<p> Many fishermen, frustrated by unwanted regulation, wonder why
government officials have the right (or even the nerve) to tell
them how much they can catch, where and when they can catch it,
and how they can catch it. The answer is found in something
called the &quot;tragedy of the commons.&quot;</p>

<p> Hundreds of years ago, community leaders observed that when a
resources was owned by the people, no one took any responsibility
for maintaining the resource. Human nature being what it is, each
person tended to use the resource to the maximum extent. There
was little incentive to conserve or invest in the resource
because others would then benefit without contributing to the
welfare of the resource. In the case of common (public) grazing
areas in England, grass soon disappeared as citizens put more and
more sheep on the land held in common. Everyone lost as &quot;the
commons&quot; became overgrazed and this became known as
&quot;the tragedy of the commons.&quot; </p>

<p> To prevent &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot; most common
property resources are held in trust and managed for the people
by state or federal government agencies. Fish living in public
waters are such a common property resource. The government has
the responsibility of managing the fish for the benefit of all
citizens, even those who do not fish.</p>

<p> So who owns Georgia's fish? You do--along with the other
seven million citizens of the State of Georgia. In order for all
to benefit from this renewable resource, your elected officials
have vested the stewardship of these resources in the State's
Department of Natural Resources. Fish populations are managed by
agency professionals to ensure that you as well as your
children's children have the same opportunities to enjoy and
benefit from Georgia's sportfish populations. The basic goal of
the fisheries biologist is to estimate the amount of fish that
can be removed or harvested safely while leaving sufficient
numbers to keep the fish population healthy. Based on fishery
investigation findings, DNR provides regulatory recommendations
to the governing bodies.</p>

<p> Renewable resources like sportfish are living things that
replenish themselves naturally and can be harvested, within
limits, on a continuing basis without eliminating them. These
limits of harvest are controlled by fishing laws and regulations
such as size and creel limits as well as season. Therefore, for
the future of sport fishing, all anglers should voluntarily
comply with fisheries regulations. &#12;&#05; sport fishing, all
anglers should voluntarily comply with fisheries regulations.</p>

<h1>GEORGIA CRUSTACEAN REPORT</h1>

<h2>Commercial Fisheries Program</h2>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Georgia's 1995 calendar year was a very good one for the
shrimp fishery with a record harvest of roughly 7 million pounds
of penaeid shrimp worth approximately 26 million dollars. The
spring roe white shrimp season (April through June) produced 1.7
million pounds and was only 75 thousand pounds below the 1991
record year. Summer brown shrimp landings equaled the 887
thousand pound average since 1957. Fall white shrimp landings
also got off to a good start with the first million pound
September since 1979, and the third highest September ever,
including years when Georgia's sounds were open. October
landings, too, were good with 872 thousand pounds, which was also
the highest since 1979. November landings (355,227 lbs) were 40%
below the historic average since 1957, but December landings
(706,160 lbs) were 36% above average. Based on inshore abundance
and size, the 1995 season was extended beyond 31 December to
allow continued harvest. However, the cold weather in early
January moved vast quantities of small shrimp out on the beaches
and prompted the season closure on 10 January 1996. In summary,
the 1995 shrimp harvest produced the all time record for Georgia
shrimpers, but market prices ran about a dollar per pound less
for the catch.</p>

<p> Season highlights included a 30 day area closure of waters
near the Altamaha River mouth during the entire month of August
to prevent the harvest of small shrimp on the beaches. This area
was also closed during the 10 day season extension in January. On
January 24, Georgia's Board of Natural Resources adopted a
Bycatch Reduction Device (BRD) Rule requiring BRD's in shrimp
trawls, effective on the season opening on 1 June 1996. During
the season the National Marine Fisheries Service implemented its
Sea Turtle Emergency Response Plan (ERP) on two different
occasions, requiring the use of top-ejecting hard TED's in shrimp
trawls (the latter restrictions under the ERP did allow use of
bottom shooting hard TED's). Georgia's and the other South
Atlantic states' bycatch reduction plans to insure compliance
with the mandatory 50% bycatch reduction requirement of the ASMFC
Weakfish Management Plan were approved by the Weakfish Management
Board. These plans require the use of BRD's. The Georgia
Legislature passed a quantity limit of 48 quarts (heads-on or 30
quarts heads-off) per person or per boat for castnet caught
shrimp, effective February 7, 1996. This legislation was the
result of strong concerns about the development of a substantial
new inshore commercial fishery as well as the rapid increase in
the number of Florida castnetters, primarily in Camden County,
coming to Georgia as a result of Florida's 5 gallon limit for
castnetters. Finally, per the concerns of commercial food
shrimpers regarding the high turtle strandings and documented
cases of crab traps fouling TED's during the early weeks of the
shrimp season, DNR is working with both industries to try to
resolve this problem, partially through a gear recycling program
for the old traps, and partially through educating the crab
industry of this potential gear conflict.</p>

<p> Georgia's crab industry appears to have been on the rebound
for several years now with reported landings for 1995 increasing
to 9.3 million pounds equaling the long term average since 1956,
and the highest annual harvest since 1984. During the past year
much concern was expressed that there would be a surge of new
crab license sales as a result of Florida's Net Ban Referendum
and the subsequent need for those displaced small boat fishermen
having to diversify to other fisheries, e.g. Georgia's
unrestricted crab fishery. Legislation to establish a &quot;crab
license&quot; and to implement a moratorium on new license sales
until July 1997 was passed in 1995 to prevent additional
exploitation of this fishery and to allow time to develop some
form of limited access to this fishery. The new law requires a
commercial &quot;crab license&quot; to deploy more than six crab
traps, but, in turn, allows the recreational community to use
this commercial gear to harvest no more than a bushel of crabs
per person without being licensed.</p>

<p> In February 1995, the Board of Natural Resources passed a
Rule requiring that all crab traps have a minimum of two escape
rings with a minimum opening of 2 3/8 inches inside diameter to
be installed on the vertical sides of the traps. There has been
much concern regarding the impacts of this ring rule on
peeler/soft crab production, but sales this year actually
increased substantially over the previous year. A special Blue
Crab Issues Subcommittee is meeting at this time to discuss the
crab ring rule, spatial competition between crab/whelk trawlers
and crab trappers in nearshore ocean waters as well as discussing
the aforementioned gear conflicts and the general effect of
abandoned crab traps on TED's. There is also some interest being
expressed about protection of sponge crabs through a harvest
prohibition.</p>

<pre>
     Federal aid coordination encompasses proposal and contractual preparation and processing;
budget formulation, monitoring, and amendments preparation; and oversight of reporting
compliance with grant obligations for seven Marine Fisheries Section grants.  They are:

     1) South Atlantic Fishery Management Council - Provide technical assistance to the South
Atlantic Fishery Management Council in the development, implementation, and monitoring of
fishery management plans and amendments to enhance fisheries management in the South
Atlantic through State/Council cooperative management of the fisheries occurring in the
Territorial Sea and Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ). <em> $30,000 Federal </em>

     2) Georgia/NMFS Regional Cooperative Statistics Program - To provide NMFS with the
harvest in pounds, and the ex-vessel and processed value (dollars) of all commercial marine
fishery resources landed in Georgia.  To satisfy data requests for commercial fisheries information
from these data sets.  To also provide NMFS with biostatistical and associated effort data on
certain commercial finfish species.  To provide finfish landings on a weekly or daily basis as
needed for species that are under federal fishery quotas. <em> $135,000 Federal </em> 

     3) Marine Fisheries Research, Surveys, and Development (USFWS/SFR) - Offshore
Bottom Survey, Annual Assessment of Red Drum Exploitation and Stock Structure, Identification
of Gag Spawning Aggregations, Spotted Seatrout Assessment, Socio-Economic Analysis of
Georgia's Marine Recreational Fishery, Offshore Fishing Reef Development &amp; Maintenance,
Inshore Fishing Reef Development &amp; Maintenance, and Fishing Pier/Platform Development &amp;
Maintenance.<em> $392,196 Federal / $130,733 State </em>

     4) Boating Access for Coastal Georgia Anglers (USFWS/SFR) - To provide new or
improved boating access to Georgia's coastal boating anglers.  To also help meet the State's
12.5% boating access obligation within each five-year period. <em> $116,681 Federal / $38,894 State </em>


     5) Fishery-Independent Assessment of Sub-Adult Red Drum in the South Atlantic Bight
(MARFIN/NMFS) - Conduct regional fishery-independent sampling and mark-recapture
experiments to provide the data needed for assessment of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) stocks
of red drum.  Secondary goals and objectives include further refinement of red drum stock
identification in the SAB, characterization of emigration and escapement from estuarine waters
to the EEZ, and a fishery-independent index of abundance for age 0 red drum. <em> $181,871 Federal /
$28,566 State </em>

     6) Assessment of Georgia's Marine Fishery Resources (IJ/NMFS) - To determine the
relative abundance, size composition, and reproductive status of Georgia's penaeid shrimp and
blue crab stocks.  Monthly fisheries-independent assessment sampling data are used to evaluate
stock status and to develop recommendations for optimum management of these important marine
resources.<em> $25,495 Federal / $8,498 State </em>

     7) Interstate Fisheries Management Planning and Implementation (ACFCMA/NMFS) -
Increase the precision level of bycatch estimates of finfish species in the commercial penaeid
shrimp trawl fishery in Georgia waters and in the EEZ off Georgia.  Provide samples for
determining the age and genetic structure of selected species occurring in the bycatch.  Collect
fishery-independent data in the inshore and nearshore waters of Georgia to compare catch rates
of selected species to rates observed during similar work in the early 1970s, and to provide
reference and supplemental collections for bycatch characterization work.  Also provide
administrative support to the State of Georgia for meeting the public information, regulatory,
legislative, and technical deliberation needs generated by the ACFCMA. <em> $89,220 Federal</em>

<p> The Ecological Services Section is responsible for the
management of Georgia's marshes and beaches through permitting
and licensing, water quality monitoring, and coastal area
management programs. The Ecological Services Section was formed
in 1991 by combining the Marsh and Beach Section with the
Shellfish Sanitation Program of the Marine Fisheries Section. The
Section is coordinated through four primary programs: Coastal
Management Program, Enviromental Health Program, Habitat
Management Program, and Operations Program. These programs are
complimented by four federally-funded projects: Altamaha River
Watershed Project, Marina Pumpout Project, Section 401 Water
Quality Certification Assumption Project, and Wetlands Education
Project.</p>

<p> The <em>Marine Fisheries Section</em> has been an integral
component of Coastal Resources Division since its creation in
1978. Formerly the Coastal Fisheries Section under the Game and
Fish Division, the Section historically conducted management
activities (stock monitoring and regulatory actions) almost
exclusively in support of the state's multimillion dollar
commercial fisheries. In the 1970's the Section expanded its
focus into inshore and offshore recreational fisheries. The
offshore artificial reef program began in the early 70's,
followed by the initiation of ongoing life history and stock
assessment studies of Georgia's most important marine sportfishes
in the late 70's. With the transfer of the Section into the
Coastal Resources Division, these activities were continued as
activities of three more comprehensive Programs: <b>Outer
Continental Shelf</b>, <b>Recreational Fisheries</b>, and <b>Commercial
Fisheries</b>. An <b>Administrative Work Unit</b> provides
support sevices to these programs. </p>

<h2>Floating Dock Construction at Existing Boat Ramps</h2>

<p> One of DNR's primary strategic initiatives is to improve
coastal fishing for boating anglers by constructing
fixed/floating docks at existing boat ramp sites. Considering
Georgia's 6 to 8 foot tidal amplitude, ramps with floating docks
greatly enhance boat launching by improving angler safety and
reducing boat damage. Floating docks also provide much needed
access for Georgia's non-boating public.</p>

<p> Of the 34 public boat ramps in Georgia's tidal waters, very
few are equipped with a fixed/floating dock. DNR has identified
24 of these existing ramps in need of fixed/floating dock
improvements. Public boat ramps proposed for construction of
floating dock facilities for FY-97 through FY-99 include:</p>

<h2>Boat Ramp Repair</h2>

<p> Boating access in coastal Georgia is relatively limited
overall and is woefully inadequate in some coastal counties and
population centers to meet the demands of ever-increasing
marine-based recreation. Over half of the existing public boat
ramps accessing saltwaters are in need of some degree of repair.
DNR has identified 20 boat ramps that exhibit various degrees of
deterioration, ranging from cracking and separation to extreme
erosion that prevents boat launching at low tide.</p>

<p> Many of the coastal boat ramps need repairs. Erosion from
tidal currents has resulted in dangerous drop offs at the base of
some ramps, resulting in the collapse of the lower portion of the
ramp and even loss of vehicles and trailers. Presently, DNR owns
or controls 11 public boat ramps in Georgia's saltwaters with the
remaining 23 belonging to local city or county governments.
During FY-97, efforts will be directed to surveying these coastal
ramps to identify existing conditions, set priorities, formulate
specific recommendations for repairs, and determine the most
appropriate approach for repairs.</p>

<h1>Fishing Pier Construction </h1>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries Program</h2>

<h3> John Pafford, Program Leader</h3>

<p> Shoreside access to fishable marine and estuarine waters is
extremely limited in coastal Georgia. Despite vast acreage of
saltwaters, most creeks and rivers are separated from high ground
by large expanses of saltmarsh. There is a paucity of public deep
water access available to the non-boating public. High ground
areas suitable for construction of public fishing piers is
extremely limited in coastal Georgia. What little high ground
property is available is typically too costly to develop for
public saltwater access. The number of sites suitable for
development of non-boating fishing access is expected to decrease
while costs and public demand for providing this needed access
are expected to increase. It is imperative that DNR address
increasing non-boating access needs to meet the demand of a
growing population as well as coastal tourism. The need is
particularly acute in the northern portion of Georgia's coast.
Currently, using federal Sportfish Restoration funds and
state/local government support, DNR is constructing public
fishing piers in Chatham County.</p>

<p> Red drum and spotted seatrout are the most targeted inshore
marine sportfish in coastal Georgia. Previous research indicates
that each estuarine system has an individual population of
spotted seatrout and immature red drum. Biotelemetry studies have
revealed that adult red drum demonstrate fidelity to discrete
spawning areas. Stock assessment of red drum and spotted seatrout
requires information of exploitation, growth, fecundity (egg
production), angler harvest, and age structure.</p>

<p> MARFIN is a competitive grant program administered by the
National Marine Fisheries Service. This interstate project
involving Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina is titled
&quot; Fishery-independent Assessment of Subadult Red Drum in the
South Atlantic Bight&quot;. This was the first multi-state and
multi-year MARFIN grant awarded. The project period is from
September 1, 1994 thru August 31, 1997.</p>

<p> The objective of this project is to conduct regional
fishery-independent sampling and mark-recapture experiments to
provide the data needed for the assessment of South Atlantic
Bight (SAB) stocks of red drum. Stratified random sampling of
estuarine habitats used by red drum is being conducted in each of
the respective states using entanglement gear. Length-composition
and age-composition data are being compiled, reduced, and
analyzed to develop annual and cohort-specific mortality rates.
In addition, annual mark-recapture experiments will be used to
describe length-specific and age-specific vulnerability of red
drum within the recreational fishery. This project is being
conducted over a three year period in order to provide valid
estimates of mortality which are free of the effects of
recruitment variation. Data provided from this project will be
less biased than the fishery-dependent data currently used to
assess South Atlantic Bight red drum stocks. Any questions can be
directed to the Recreational Fisheries Program. </p>

<h1>Marine Sportfish Creel Survey</h1>

<h2>Nick Nicholson, Project Leader</h2>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Fishery-dependent data are important for regional and state
management decision-making. Current levels of effort in the
Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) are
inadequate for timely and accurate data collection. The
Recreational Fisheries Program has worked cooperatively with the
MRFSS and plans to renew this effort to expand the number of
intercepts and telephone interviews.</p>

<p> The data provided by an expanded level of effort within the
MRFSS is needed to allow state/regional fishery managers to make
more timely and valid decisions. This will allow more accurate
calculations of coastal fishing pressure and help monitor the
status of Georgia's marine recreational fishery.</p>

<h1>Socio-Economic Angler Survey</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Clark Evans, Project Leader</h2>

<p> Email: <a href="mailto:clark@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us">

<p> Phone: (912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Efforts to determine the economic value of Georgia's marine
recreational fishery have, to date, been limited. The most recent
economic survey was produced by the Sport Fishing Institute
utilizing data obtained from the National Survey of Fishing,
Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. As the marine
portion of the National Survey in Georgia was based on a sample
size of less than 30 individuals who saltwater fished, results
from the SFI study yielded extrapolated values that are
questionable in regards to their scope and accuracy.</p>

<p> Baseline economic data related to the marine recreational
fishery allow for the accurate determination of the economic
impacts of the fishery to the state. Additionally, this
information is essential to the determination of the economic
impacts of regulations on the fishing public.</p>

<p> Marine recreational fisheries also have value in attributes
which are less tangible or are not immediately quantifiable.
These attributes can be measured in terms of demographics,
attitudes, motivations, satisfactions, fishing behaviors,
participation rates, and management preferences. It has been
asserted that fishery managers must consider human benefits and
angler experiences as tangible elements which can be quantified
or modified. Without this key information managers lack the
ability to effectively predict the impacts of regulatory actions
on the affected user group or to determine angler acceptance of
management measures. </p>

<p> In 1990, CRD attempted to document the attitudes of Georgia
resident saltwater anglers about present and future management
issues. The study methodology employed a single survey instrument
and provided a &quot;snap shot&quot; of angler attitudes and
opinions as they were at the time of the survey. A primary
conclusion of the report noted the need to undertake additional
survey work to determine socio-economic characteristics,
demographics, and management preferences of Georgia saltwater
anglers.</p>

<p> Angler motivations, satisfactions, participation rates,
management preferences, attitudes and opinions can change over
time. A problematic aspect of investigating these factors is that
a single survey instrument will provide only a static indication
of what are essentially dynamic attributes. In an ongoing study
of Texas saltwater anglers, Texas A&amp;M University has employed
a longitudinal panel study design. A subgroup of anglers have
been surveyed twice a year since 1989. This design allows for the
identification of changes in fishing participation and management
preferences over time.</p>

<p> The ultimate success of any fisheries management policy is
dependent on the modification of human behavior, voluntary or
enforced. Therefore, managers must understand the human component
of the management equation which is essential to understanding
and implementing effective regulatory measures. An increased
understanding of the human dimension of the marine recreational
fishery is absolutely essential in the development of a
foundation for advocacy and long-term support. </p>

<p> GOALS &amp; OBJECTIVE:</p>

<p> 1) To achieve a better understanding of the socio-economic
aspects of the Georgia marine recreational fishery for purposes
of incorporation into a responsive management strategy.</p>

<p> EXPECTED RESULTS &amp; BENEFITS:</p>

<p> Information regarding the value of Georgia's marine
recreational fishery will enhance agency ability in assessing the
cost/benefit of State expenditures which is essential to the
budgeting process. Data specific to the economic expenditures of
the angler population will allow for the determination of
economic impacts of management measures. Attitudinal,
participation, motivation, satisfaction, and management
preference data will more clearly define the angler population
and will provide an indication of the acceptance of current or
proposed management measures. Additionally, gathering these data
over a period of years, via a subgroup, will provide a continuous
feedback mechanism through which long-term support and advocacy
will be fostered. </p>

<p> APPROACH:</p>

<p> Feasibility Study (FY 97): Year one of the study will be
devoted to determining the appropriate methodologies and
associated costs for statewide survey of Georgia saltwater
anglers and subsequent sub-sample surveys (Job 1). A review of
the relevant human dimensions literature will be conducted to
gather applicable research theory, survey methods, sample size
considerations, and to refine project goals and objectives.
Practical information will be gathered via interviews with state
agency and university researchers having experience with similar
surveys. Information collected from the literature review and
interviews will then be incorporated into a project methodology
specific to application in Georgia. </p>

<p> Statewide Survey (FY 98): A statewide survey of saltwater
anglers will be developed and administered to Georgia saltwater
anglers in year two (Job 2). Questions will focus on
demographics, expenditures, participation, and other issues of
importance. Survey data will be collected, reduced, and analyzed
to produce a final report containing baseline economic data,
participation rates, and demographics. This information will be
supplied to the state legislature, state fisheries managers,
citizens advisory committees, federal fisheries managers,
interstate fisheries management commissions, and the public.</p>

<p> Panel Survey I (FY 99): During year three, a representative
sub-sample, or panel, of Georgia saltwater anglers will be
developed based on the demographics of responses to the statewide
survey (Job 3). Surveys will be developed and administered twice
yearly. Questions will focus on expenditures, attitudes,
motivations, satisfactions, and management preferences for actual
and proposed measures. Survey data will be collected, reduced,
analyzed, and reported semi-annually. This information will be
made available to the state legislature, state fisheries
managers, citizens advisory committees, federal fisheries
managers, interstate fisheries management commissions, and the
public. Additionally, the panel of anglers will receive,
semi-annually, a 2-4 page synopsis of the results of each survey.</p>

<p> Panel Survey II (FY 00): Two surveys will be developed and
administered to the panel of saltwater anglers in year four (Job
4). Again, questions will focus on expenditures, attitudes,
motivations, satisfactions, and management preferences for actual
and proposed measures. Survey data will be collected, reduced,
analyzed, and reported bi-annually. This information will be made
available to the state legislature, state fisheries managers,
citizens advisory committees, federal fisheries managers,
interstate fisheries management commissions, and the public.
Additionally, the panel of anglers will receive, semi-annually, a
2-4 page synopsis of the results of each survey. </p>

<h1>Saltwater/Freshwater Fishing Participation</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Nick Nicholson, Project Leader</h2>

<p> <img src="/CRD/art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> To properly allocate Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration
funds between saltwater and freshwater anglers and to provide
data necessary to better manage Georgia's fishery resources, it
is essential to estmate numbers and determine the relative
percentages of resident Georgia saltwater and freshwater anglers
who fished within the state of Georgia during a specified period
of time. In the past, estimates of saltwater anglers were based
on an extremely small sample size; and the households that were
drawn by the U.S. Bureau of Census were not drawn based on the
population of anglers or angler households in the state, but
rather on some &quot;tiered&quot; sampling scheme which gives
metropolitan counties a high priority (i.e. all are selected),
and rural counties a low priority (few are selected). More
statistically valid estimates of participation are critical for
sound management decisions and proper fund allocations.</p>

<h1> Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission</h1>

<h2> Georgia Overview</h2>

<p>The Commission was formed by the fifteen Atlantic coast states
more than fifty years ago to assist in managing and conserving
their shared coastal fishery resources. With the recognition that
fish do not adhere to political boundaries, the states formed an
Interstate Compact, which was approved by the U.S Congress and
signed into law in 1942 by the President. The states have found
that their mutual interest in sustaining healthy coastal fishery
resources is best achieved by working cooperatively, in
collaboration with the federal government. Through this approach,
the states uphold their collective fisheries management
responsibilities in a cost effective, timely, and responsive
fashion.</p>

<p> States are represented on the Commission by three
Commissioners, including the Director for the state's marine
fisheries management agency, a state legislator, and an
individual representing fishery interests, appointed by the state
governor. The Commissioners for the State of Georgia are Ms.
Susan Shipman (Coastal Resources Division), Representative Hanson
Carter, and Mr. Ralph Balkom. These Commissioners participate in
deliberations in the Commission's five primary policy arenas:
interstate fisheries management; research and statistics; habitat
conservation; recreational fisheries; and law enforcement.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Interstate Fisheries Management</h2>

<p>Through the Interstate Fisheries Management Program,
Commissioners prepare fishery management plans to address the
conservation needs and socioeconomic concerns of Atlantic coast
fisheries. In January 1994, as a result of its success in the
management and conservation of Atlantic striped bass stocks, the
Commission became responsible for developing and implementing
fishery management programs for all Atlantic coast
interjurisdictional fisheries under the Atlantic Coastal
Fisheries Cooperative Management Act. Species regulated under
this program, which occur in Georgia waters include:<em> American
shad and river herring, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic sturgeon,
bluefish, menhaden, red drum, Spanish mackerel, spot, spotted
seatrout, and weakfish.</em></p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Research and Statistics</h2>

<p>Accurate and timely fisheries data are critical for effective
fisheries management. The Commission's Research and Statistics
Program works to ensure that the best scientific information
available is incorporated into the Commission's fishery
management plans. This program also works to coordinate state and
federal fisheries information programs so that the data collected
can be used on a coastwide basis.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Healthy Fish Habitat</h2>

<p>An important objective of the Commission is to conserve and
improve marine fish habitat. Healthy fish habitat is a vital
precursor to healthy fish stocks. To accomplish this, the
Commissions Habitat Program encompasses public education and
policy development.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries</h2>

<p>The Commission's Sport Fish Restoration Program is aimed at
improving fishery conservation and recreational fishing
opportunities for Atlantic coast marine species. Through this
program, the Commission provides liaison between state and
federal agencies and non-governmental organizations to promote
interstate and state/federal cooperation on marine recreational
fisheries programs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>The Commission's Law Enforcement Program assists the states in
coordinating their law enforcement efforts through data exchange
and problem identification. The program's primary objective is to
ensure that the law enforcement provisions of the Commission's
fishery management plans are adequate.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>FEDERAL AID IN SPORT FISH RESTORATION</h1>

<p> Did you know that each time you buy fishing equipment or fuel
for your boat, you are also helping to enhance sport fish
restoration? Many anglers do not realize that sporting goods
manufacturers pay a tax on items they produce. This tax is used
to purchase sites for boating access and improve boating and
fishing dock facilities. It is also used for research,
enhancement, and artificial reefs.</p>

<p> This User Pays, User Benefits funding approach began in 1937
with the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act. This Act
established excise taxes on outdoor sports equipment, with
proceeds going toward wildlife enhancement. In 1950, Congress
enacted the Sport Fish Restoration Act, sponsored by U.S. Rep.
John Dingell, Sr., of Michigan and Sen. Edwin Johnson, of
Colorado. The law, which became known as the
&quot;Dingell-Johnson Act&quot;, applies a 10 percent
manufacturer's excise tax on fishing rods, reels, creels, lures,
and flies. Tax revenues are transferred to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, which in turn distributes them to the states
for recreational sportfishing enhancement projects.</p>

<p> Each state's share is based 60 percent on its number of paid
licensed sport fishermen and 40 percent on its land and water
area. No state may receive more than 5 percent or less than 1
percent of each year's total collection.</p>

<p> In 1984, Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Rep. John Breaux
of Louisiana sponsored the Wallop-Breaux Amendment to the Sport
Fish Restoration Act, extending the tax to tackle boxes, sonar
fish finders, motorboat fuels, electric motors, and other
equipment not included in the earlier laws.</p>

<p> The Wallop-Breaux Amendment requires at least 12.5 percent of
all restoration money be spent on boating access to public waters
and requires Georgia and other coastal states to fund marine
recreational fisheries projects proportionate to the ratio of
freshwater to saltwater anglers. In addition, the amendment
requires that states continue to fund fisheries at their historic
levels and not substitute federal funds for those previously
supplied by the states.</p>

<p> In Georgia, Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration funds have
attributed to the construction of 14 offshore and 11 inshore
artificial reefs, 6 non-boating fishing docks, 4 boat ramps, and
2 floating dock facilities. Also, funds were used to conduct
numerous research and survey projects including life history
studies on important marine sport fish, sport fish monitoring,
exploitation and stock structure, recreational sport fish
landings, hooking mortality, and others. Basically, these
projects were financed by the boater and/or angler and were
designed for their benefit by providing better access and better
fisheries management.</p>

<p> Phone: (912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/suntan.gif"></p>

<p> &127;</p>

<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>

<p> It is the mission of the Georgia Coastal Management Program
to balance economic development in Georgia's coastal areas with
preservation of natural, environmental, historic, archaeological,
and recreational resources for the benefit of Georgia's present
and future generations.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Georgia's Coast:</h3>

<p> Georgia has a beautiful coastal area with extensive marshes
and attractive beaches. Economic growth has been healthy and
Georgia's coast is a popular place to live, work, and visit. This
popularity, however, affects coastal resources and the overall
quality of life on the coast. Some of the activities in the
coastal area are not compatible. Conflicts and resource
limitations are already affecting coastal communities. Coastal
issues need to be addressed through a comprehensive management
program that considers all aspects of the coastal uses and
issues. Issues that are important to Georgia's coast include:
water supply limitations, identification of historic sites,
impacts to endangered species, beach erosion and hazard problems,
water quality degradation, declining fishery populations,
increased population growth, dredging and spoil disposal, lack of
beach access, and need for energy planning. As Georgia grows in
population, these issues will become more pressing.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>History:</h3>

<p> In September 1992, Governor Zell Miller directed the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources Coastal Resources Division
(DNR-CRD) to develop a coastal management plan utilizing funding
available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management
(NOAA-OCRM). Before the plan was written, the DNR-CRD conducted a
thorough review of Georgia's existing laws and regulations and
concluded that Georgia could receive federal approval for a
coastal management plan based on existing authorities. Moreover,
DNR-CRD committed to developing a plan that would not result in
additional government bureaucracy. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Public Participation:</h3>

<p> To assist DNR-CRD in creating a coastal management plan,
Governor Miller appointed a 27-person Coastal Zone Advisory
Committee comprised of citizens from the coastal counties of
Georgia. Through the Coastal Zone Advisory Committee, nine public
task forces were organized to make policy recommendations to
DNR-CRD. Altogether, over 200 citizens were directly involved in
the development of the plan. An additional 1,428+ citizens
reviewed the plan and provided comment at public meetings,
hearings, and presentations. Public involvement has been and
continues to be crucial in the process of developing a coastal
management plan.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Plan:</h3>

<p> The Georgia Coastal Management Program establishes a network
among agencies handling coastal issues, presents a comprehensive
framework for managing coastal resources, and promotes open
communication among the various parties with coastal interests.
Based on recommendations submitted to DNR-CRD by the citizen task
forces and the Coastal Zone Advisory Committee, the plan document
describes the significant assets of Georgia's coast, identifies
the problems and issues Georgia faces as its coastal region
continues to develop and grow, and provides the management
framework for resolving those issues. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Federal Approval:</h3>

<p> The federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 created a
voluntary program for states to develop and administer coastal
management programs. This Act set broad guidelines for state
programs and the criteria for approval. Individual states were
given the responsibility of identifying priority issues for their
respective coasts and implementing their program using state laws
and regulations. General concerns such as resources that affect
national defense and interstate transport must be addressed to
ensure that the management plan does not unduly hamper these
activities. The federal Coastal Zone Management Program provides
participating states with significant benefits, including federal
consistency, funding, and technical assistance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Current Activity:</h3>

<p> The issue of whether or not to pursue a federally-approved
coastal management program is currently up before a state
legislative study committee. The committee will meet Monday,
September 16, and Tuesday, September 17, to learn about the
proposed program, the benefits of federal approval for Georgia,
and the steps that would be necessary to enact a
federally-approvable coastal management program. This meeting is
open to the public. For more information, contact the Georgia
Coastal Management Program.</p>

<p> <strong>Shellfish Sanitation</strong></p>

<p> As mandated by state law (O.C.G.A. 27-4-197) the Department
of Natural Resources cooperates with the Department of
Agriculture to administer and operate a Shellfish Sanitation
Program sufficient to be certified by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The Department of Agriculture has the
responsibility for certification of handling facilities for
interstate shipments of shellfish in Georgia, which is included
in Part II of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP)
Manual of Operations. The DNR has responsibility for
classification and patrol of shellfish growing areas which
incorporates Part I of the NSSP Manual of Operations. The
Environmental Health Program (EHP) composes Sanitary Surveys for
the four growing areas in Georgia. </p>

<p> The EHP's efforts in shellfish sanitation represent the
foundation for the assurance of public health protection of
consumers of molluscan shellfish produced and harvested
commercially or recreational in Georgia. During each month the
EHP monitors shellfish growing waters and performs water quality
analyses using the Program's certified water quality laboratory.
The EHP also conducts extensive shoreline reconnaissance to
identify and evaluate all actual or potential pollution sources
that may affect the sanitary quality of a shellfish growing area.
Annually, water quality monitoring results and shoreline
reconnaissance data are incorporated into revisions and
comprehensive updates of these sanitary survey reports. The EHP
is evaluated each year by the US Food and Drug Administration to
measure compliance with NSSP requirements and is recognized as
having one of the strongest sanitation programs in the country. </p>

<p> The EHP also coordinates annual FDA evaluations of the patrol
element of DNR's Shellfish Sanitation Program by cooperating with
the Wildlife Resources Division, Law Enforcement Section. The
Georgia Shellfish Patrol Policy document, which is also a
requirement of the NSSP, is composed by the EHP and updated
annually or more frequently as required. The EHP manager is also
actively involved in the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation
Conference (ISSC) and Gulf and South Atlantic States Shellfish
Conference (GSASSC) each year. The ISSC is the annual forum for
development of national and international shellfish sanitation
policies for incorporation into the NSSP. The GSASSC is a
regional conference important for representation of regional
shellfish sanitation and shellfish resource management interests. </p>

<p> In addition to providing public health protection, the DNR's
shellfish sanitation program has historically played a
significant role in regulating the ever increasing demand for
coastal development in Georgia. &quot;Approved&quot; and
&quot;Restricted&quot; shellfish growing areas represent an
existing use under Section 404(b) of the Clean Water Act which
provides the DNR an avenue for input in the federal permitting
process to limit the environmental impacts associated with
various activities on the coast.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<strong>

<p>Resource Management</strong></p>

<p> The EHP also has a limited resource management function
through permitting of commercial harvest of shellfish production
in Georgia. The EHP issues Master Collecting Permits and
individual harvest permits to commercial industry members in the
state. The Environmental Health Program also administers leases
for exclusive rights to commercial harvest of shellfish resources
on state owned estuarine properties. There are currently three
state commercial shellfish leases which generate $2,275 in annual
fees which are returned to the program. Information regarding
entry into Georgia's shellfish industry is routinely distributed
to interested individual. The EH also manages approximately
20,000 acres of Public Recreational Shellfish Harvest Areas in
the six coastal counties. The EHP maintains approximately 100
signs identifying these areas and distributes charts marking the
locations to the general public upon request. As an added measure
of public health protection, the EHP also posts approximately 400
signs which identify locations unsafe for shellfish harvesting. </p>

<h1>Habitat Management Program</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Ecological Services Section</h2>

<p> <em>Program Manager: Terry West</em></p>

<p> E-mail <a href="mailto:terry@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us">terry@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us</a></p>

<p> <img src="art/island.gif"></p>

<p> The Habitat Management Program was established in July, 1994
as part of a reorganization of the Ecological Services Section.
The Program's function is to administer the mandated regulatory
responsibilities of the Coastal Resources Division: Coastal
Marshlands Protection Act (CMPA), Shore Protection Act (SPA), and
Revocable License Program. Staffing consists of a Program
Manager, two Permit Coordinators, and a clerical position to
administer the legally mandated authorities for the entire
coastal area: 100 miles of ocean-front beaches, 2344 linear miles
of coastline, and about 700,000 acres of marshlands and
waterbottoms. </p>

<p> Under the authority of these laws, the Habitat Management
Program conducts inspections to determine jurisdiction lines,
collect information, advise applicants and investigate
violations. Based on the recommendations of the staff, the
Coastal Marshlands Protection and Shore Protection Committees
issue or deny permits. </p>

<p> The Ecological Services Section is particularly concerned
with permitting projects that serve public interests on the
barrier islands. Examples of projects that require permits are
marinas, boat ramps, boardwalks and beach access crossovers which
protect the sensitive sand dune systems. </p>

<p> Accomplishment of these directives requires staff
coordination with federal, state, and local agencies;
consultation and negotiations with project applicants;
investigation of unauthorized and illegal activities;
determination of jurisdictional areas; and compliance inspections
of permitted projects. </p>

<p> The regulatory functions of the Ecological Services Section
have proven highly successful for a quarter of a century and are
recognized nationwide for this success. The General Assembly, in
legislating the CMPA and SPA, recognized the significant and
varied benefits of maintaining these fragile coastal habitats.
Sustainable populations of many species of marine life and
wildlife are dependent upon these habitats. Georgia's coastal
marshlands and beaches also provide recreation, serve as buffers
from natural storms, help control erosion and flooding, and
filter and disseminate pollutants. These habitats are therefore
vitally linked to the economy of not only the coastal area, but
to the entire state. </p>

<p> Due to the complexity of coastal geography and escalating
demands on the available resources due to population growth, the
management of our coastal habitats has become increasingly
complicated and controversial. Private property rights, public
access, water rights, economic growth versus resource protection,
and excessive governmental bureaucracy are but some of the
regulatory process issues at the forefront of the political arena
today. The regulatory functions of the Ecological Services
Section have for years been recognized for their flexibility to
balance development and conservation of vital estuarine habitat
areas. A primary goal of the Habitat Management Program is to
provide fair and equitable administration of the regulatory
functions while continually seeking to improve the efficiency of
service to the citizens of Georgia. </p>

<p> The Program has initiated changes in the past two years which
have aided attainment of this goal. In August 1994, the Program
assumed the revocable license program and marina waterbottom
leasing responsibilities from the DNR Real Estate Unit in
Atlanta. The Habitat Management Program's administration of the
revocable license authorities has received praise from the Corps
of Engineers, local governments, and citizens for reducing time
and providing efficient service to applicants. Several
administrative procedure changes were incorporated into the
revocable license process which reduced staff time and paperwork,
including the consolidation of five previous application forms
into one. The staff also meshed the revocable license process
with the CMPA and SPA processes, thus eliminating paperwork in a
step in the permitting process for applicants. With regard to the
marina waterbottoms leasing responsibilities, the provisions of
which are of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act, the staff
performed an initial analysis of the required procedures. This
analysis revealed a prime example of governmental bureaucracy -
duplicative efforts by different agencies, unnecessary paperwork,
unnecessary time delays in processing, and unnecessary costs to
applicants. The staff proposed legislative changes which were
approved by the 1995 General Assembly, signed by the Governor,
and took effect July 1, 1995. These changes not only simplify the
entire process and reduce processing time, but also provide the
lease fee proceeds to be retained by the Program instead of going
onto the general fund. </p>

<p> The primary responsibility of the Operations Management
Program of the Ecological Services Section is the formulation of
Section operational objectives, the identificaiton and
procurement of objective funding sources, and the accomplishment
of those objectives through effective and efficient processes. In
periods of fiscal austerity, the function of the Operations
Management Program is particularly significant, since needed
improvement level projects must often be funded through sources
other than the State. Chief among the functions of the Operations
Management program is the identification and procurement of
alternative program funding sources. During the 1996 fiscal year,
the Operations Management Program procured five federally funded
projects totalling approximately $800,000. These federally funded
projects alllow the Coastal Resources Division to conduct
research, devise resources management plans, and acquire critical
habitat that would not be possible with state funding.
Applications are now in progress for six additional projects
totalling more than $1,000,000. </p>

<p> The Operations Management Program provides coordination,
supervision, and field assistance to federally funded and branch
projects not associated with other Programs. Current activities
include the implementation of a statewide Wetlands Training
Project for DNR law enforcement personnel, educators, and
officials of local government and development of a Joint General
Permit between the Georgia DNR and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Projects scheduled to commence in Fiscal Year 1996
include implementation of a partnership effort with The Nature
Conservancy to conduct an Altamaha River Watershed Demonstration
Project leading to increased protection of that ecosystem;
implementaiton of a Coastal Sediment Monitoring Project in
cooperation with the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography; and
continuation of the statewide Wetlands Training Initiative. </p>

<p> The Operations Management Program ensures continuous quality
emprovement in the Ecological Services Section by providing
on-going support to all section projects and activities. The
Operations Management Program provides on-going inservice
training and facilitates Section initiatives such as Strategic
Planning Efforts. The program provides budgetary planning,
oversight and control. The Program coordinates activities between
the Ecological Services Section and other Division programs such
as procurement and accounting. The Program also administers
Section accounting, purchasing, and inventory control processes.
In addition, the Program provides recruitment and other personnel
related services to the Section. </p>

<h1>Altamaha River Watershed Project</h1>

<p> <img src="art/blue_bar.gif"></p>

<p> The Altamah system drains 19,400 km2 (7,760 mi2) of piedmont
terrain and 28,800 km2 (11,520 mi2) of coastal plain, making it
the largest drainage area east of the Mississippi River basin.
Undammed below the fall line, the Altamaha is unique among
watersheds in the eastern United States. The lower Altamaha
watershed, along the Altamaha River proper, boasta the highest
number of rare plants, animals, and natural community occurences
in Georgia. The lower Altamaha watershed also contains the
largest contiguos riparian corridor in the state, with floodplain
over 17 km wide in some areas. Nevertheless, somae areas are
logged to the riverbank, and multiple wetlands and other natural
communities are at risk. The relatively small number of
landowners in the lower Altamaha watershed, some of whom own
large tracts of land, offers great opportunity for protection of
wetlands via direct landowner negotiation.</p>

<p> The Watershed Protection Approach Demonstration Project
focuses on the lower Altamaha River watershed ecosystem and
expands efforts of the Georgia Department of natural Resources,
Coastal Resources Division, in cooperation with The Nature
Conservancy of Georgia, in protecting and preserving tidal and
nontidal wetland ecosystems throughout the state. The project
inventories and analyzes wetlnad and water quality data of the
Altamaha River via digitization and analysis of landcover, land
ownership, ecological significance, point source pollution, and
water quality layers on a Geographic Information System (GIS).
The project also classifies and ranks priority wetlands, provides
information which can be used by local decsionmakers, and is
working to design a wetlands protection protection strategy for
the watershed from the confluence to the ocean. In addition,
individualized maps and packets for landowners identifying
reources, expalianing the valua of those resources, and
describing protection options are being developed through the
project. The closing stage of the project will outline
contributions and applicability of the demostration project
methodology to other watersheds in Georgia and in the nation.</p>

<p> In this effort to manage Georgia's natural resources in a
sustainable manner, the following project objectives have been
identified:</p>

<p> 1) Develop a GIS database encompassing the Altamaha River
Watershed, including already collected data, landownership,
current management, landcover, and pollution sources for analysis
and use in coordinated planning, protection, and restoration
efforts. </p>

<p> 2) Conduct a landcover classification to be used for
watershed analysis, utilizing satellite imagery, field surveys,
and of the methodology developed by TNC in its national pilot
project. </p>

<p> 3) Analyze threats to the wetland resources, including
sources of stresses. </p>

<p> 4) Determine wetland protection priorities, through
correlation of areas of highest conservation interest and
concern, areas facing the greatest threats, and opportunities
based on landownership, land use, and regulatory jurisdiction. </p>

<p> 5) Develop a comprehensive system-wide protection plan for
the Altamaha River Watershed. This plan will:</p>

<p> a) identify and rank priority wetlands;</p>

<p> b) outline goals to protect priority wetlands;</p>

<h3>Grant Program Development</h3>

<p> The purpose of this component shall be to plan and establish
a state grant program which will create criteria and processes
for awarding funds for the installation and renovation of pumpout
and/or dump stations in the six Georgia coastal counties. Current
data, including the 1995 Coastal Marina Survey will be analyzed
to determine areas in which the greatest needs exist. Target
areas will be identified according to boating density, number and
availability of pumpout or dump facilities, and habitat
considerations such as proximity to shellfish harvesting sites,
primary nursery areas, and water quality. </p>

<p> Based upon the analysis of survey data, marina facilities in
targeted, critical locations will be identified. Criteria for
awarding funds will be established. These elemental criteria will
include boating density, adequacy of facility, and availability
of other proximal pumpout or dump stations. Other priority
considerations may include installation of pumpout or dump
stations at fuel docks and other service areas which attract both
transient and local boaters, marinas and service facilities
catering to large numbers of transient boaters, marinas with wet
slips which cater to boats greater than 26 feet (pumpouts) or
less than 26 feet (dump stations), and marinas open to the
general public. A standardized funding application form will be
developed and completed for each facility requesting funding. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Pumpout/Dump Station Construction</h3>

<p> The purpose of this component shall be to implement the state
grant program from which funds will be awarded for the
installation and renovation of pumpout and/or dump stations in
the six Georgia coastal counties. Upon receipt of applications,
the Division will review proposed projects and grant awards based
upon prioritization of needs utilizing established criteria.
Prior to the close of the contract, pumpout or dump stations
installed or renovated will be inspected for proper installation
and operation. Based upon preliminary information generated by
the 1995 Coastal Marina Survey, three major construction projects
and five minor construction projects in coastal Georgia will be
completed during this funding period. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Public Information and Education</h3>

<p> The purpose of this component is to develop and implement a
coast-wide public education and information program designed to
build awareness of the problems associated with boat sewage and
encourage the use of pumpout and dump station facilities. The
component will also advertise the grant program and provide
information on the application process and selection criteria.
Working with private and public sector organizations, a directed
public education and information process will be developed. The
coast-wide outreach strategy will include development,
publication, and distribution of informational brochures and
materials aimed at the boating public and marine related
industry; development of a mobile display for use at boat shows
and other functions; development, publication, and distribution
of a boat sewage fact sheet; and inclusion of articles in the
public media and Departmental and Divisional newsletters and
other publications.</p>

<h3>EPA-funded State Wetlands Protection Grant Program, 7/1/96 -
6/30/99</h3>

<p> This grant seeks funding for a three-year program to continue
and expand the efforts of the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources, Coastal Resources Division to develop strategies for
the protection and preservation of existing tidal and non-tidal
wetland ecosystems within the six coastal counties. This effort
can serve as a model for enhanced wetland protection in the
inland portions of the State of Georgia as well as other states.
The proposed program is comprised of two primary developmental
components:</p>

<p> 1) Process development, transfer and assumption of the
Section 401 Water Quality Certification Program from the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division
to Coastal Resources Division in the six Georgia coastal
counties; and</p>

<p> 2) Process development, transfer and assumption of the
Regional General Permit for private, single-family, recreational
docks from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the Coastal
Resources Division within the GCMP area, incorporating current
Revocable License authrity. </p>

<p> The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The project will provide
the following wetlands protection and benefits:</p>

<p> 1. The project will improve and enhance State statutory
authority, regulations, and policies in regards to wetlands. The
Section 404 program will benefit from DNR/DRC assumption of 401
and dock GP and investigation of other NWP/GP/RP/ assumption
opportunities. Development of a GIS compatible electronic permit
tracking database system for compliance assessment, monitoring,
and enforcement will also improve the process. </p>

<p> 2. The project will improve State and Federal agency
coordination by integrating review processes between agencies and
eliminating duplicative programs to achieve more comprehensive
habitat protection. The proposal will involve coordination with a
variety of State (Environmental Protection Division, Coastal
Resources Division, etc.) and Federal (Corps of Engineers, EPA,
USFWS, NMFS, etc.) agencies to improve protection of wetland
resources. Compliance, monitoring, and enforcement will be more
efficient and coordinated as a result. The development process
will encourage the formal formulation and adoption of protocols,
rules, and guidelines for 401 certifications and conditions. </p>

<p> 3. The proposal will encourage consistency with the 404(b)(1)
guidelines. </p>

<p> 4. The proposal will enhance permit tracking, which will be
valuable in encouraging more vigorous compliance, monitoring, and
enforcement efforts, especially to newly-trained DNR conservation
rangers who will identify and report wetland violations. </p>

<p> 5. The proposal will identify and combine various programs,
resources, and recommendations into a strategy that could be
extended throughout the entire State of Georgia. </p>

<p> The proposed project accomplished the above stated benefits
through a collaborative effort between the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources, Coastal Resources Division; the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection
Division; and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District
in an effort to improve and streamline protection of wetlands in
the State of Georgia. </p>

<h3>EPA State Wetlands Protection Grant Program 7/1/94 - 6/30/96</h3>

<p> Thiis grant project improves state wetlands management
functions through the development of an in-service training
program which meets two designated goals. First, the in-service
training program enhances the capabilities of Georgia Department
of Natural Resources conservation officers to recognize and
report violations of federal and state regulatory laws and
permits designed to prevent the loss and degradation of wetlands
caused by erosion and sedimentaiton and non-point source
pollution. This project also &quot;trains-the- trainer&quot; by
providing Georgia's conservation officers with a wetlands
training program, including lesson plans, audio visuals,and
printed support materials, which they disseminate throughout the
state via presentations to various civic, school, and sportsmens'
groups. </p>

<p> An additional goal of the in-service training program is to
enhance understanding of the ecological value of wetlands and
wetlands protection of local government officials, educators, and
teachers in coastal counties by providing training and printed
support materials. In addition, this project enabled the
digitization and conversion of existing National Wetlands
Inventory maps of the six Georgia coastal counties for use in
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Utilizing the GIS aids
State and local governments in identifying wetlands; documenting
wetland alteration and conversion; and assist in conservation,
protection, and managment decision making. This project is
carried out through the Coastal Resources Division of the
Department of Natural Resources which is the sponsor of the
project and the primary contractor with EPA. The Coastal
Resources Division has sub-contracted portions of the project to
the Coastal Georgia Regional Development Center and to the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory.</p>

<h1> Outer Continental Shelf Program </h1>

<h2> Marine Fisheries Section</h2>

<h3> Henry Ansley, Program Leader</h3>

<p>Email: <a href="mailto:henry@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us">
henry@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us </a></p>

<p> Phone: (912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> The Outer Continental Shelf Program is comprised of five
associates (biologist, two wildlife/marine technicians, and two
research vessel crew). Program associates perform activities in
two primary areas: offshore research and surveys and offshore
recreational fisheries enhancement. Research and surveys
encompass an ongoing offshore bottom survey and life history
studies of offshore reef fishes important to Georgia. Enhancement
efforts entail artificial reef construction and maintenance. The
offshore bottom survey documents offshore bottom habitat
supporting recreational fishing opportunities and disseminates
this information through periodic publication of an updated, free
Georgia Offshore Fishing Guide. Survey results are imperative for
regional management decisions focused at protecting essential
reef fish habitat. The OCS Program's study of gag grouper is
providing critical information to state and federal fishery
managers on gag reproductive behavior/movement in order to avert
overfishing, possible stock collapse, or unnecessarily
restrictive regulatory measures impacting Georgia anglers. Among
the most popular of gamefish with Georgia anglers, gag grouper is
one of several reef fish species for which CRD has management
authority through O.C.G.A. 27-4-130.1 and Board of Natural
Resources Rules 391-2-4.</p>

<p> Offshore artificial reef development and maintenance
constitute the foundation of the OCS Program's recreational
fishing enhancement activities. Thirteen artificial reefs located
5 - 23 nm offshore have been constructed to provide safely
accessible offshore angling opportunities for Georgia anglers, as
well as to provide fisheries habitat necessary to enhance
valuable offshore fisheries. The OCS Program maintains thirteen
buoys to mark the offshore artificial reefs. These typically
large systems permitted through the U. S. Coast Guard not only
assist anglers in locating and utilizing the reefs but also
function as important navigational aids. The fishing
opportunities associated with artificial reefs translate into
direct economic benefits realized by businesses, coastal
communities and government. Direct expenditures by saltwater
fishermen in Georgia are estimated at $53.4 million annually,
with the total impact of Georgia's marine recreational fishing
industry estimated at $250 million annually.</p>

<p> While there is no mandate to construct artificial reefs, once
constructed, the State assumes short and long term responsibility
for each site under COE Regional Permit No. RP0036. There is no
mandate to buoy a reef once the site/obstruction has been
charted; however, while buoyed under USCG permit, there is an
obligation to maintain the aid.</p>

<p> The OCS Program maintains responsibility for the Georgia
Saltwater Gamefish Records Program. This activity recognizes
outstanding saltwater sportfish catches, promotes ethical angling
practices, provides data on saltwater species, and provides
anglers with a popular records program. The OCS Program Leader
represents Georgia on the SEAMAP -South Atlantic Board, which
establishes policy for this cooperative state/federal
fishery-independent data collection program targeting marine
fisheries resources of regional importance. Other miscellaneous
responsibilities of OCS Program associates include Altamaha
houseboat removal, recycling, and public relations cruises (which
will likely increase in FY96 with the new offshore R/V). Program
activities are supported by both State and non-competitive
Federal grant-in-aid funding sources.</p>

<p> Phone: (912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> The Marine Recreational Fisheries Program is comprised of
nine associates (four biologists and five hourly wage
technicians) who conduct research and surveys, and monitor stock
status of recreationally important saltwater sportfish.
Additionally, this unit is actively enhancing inshore marine
recreational fishing through boating and non-boating access
development and improvement, and inshore artificial reef
construction.</p>

<p> Four studies constitute the fishery independent research and
monitoring of Georgia's inshore sportfisheries: spotted seatrout
assessment, assessment of red drum exploitation and stock
structure, biotelemetry of young adult red drum, and assessment
of sub-adult red drum in the South Atlantic Bight. Because of
their status as Georgia's most popular inshore sportfish,
estuarine populations of spotted seatrout and red drum are
intensively monitored to determine exploitation and survival
rates as well as stock structure. Additional research emphasis is
attempting to better ascertain these parameters for immature red
drum, so as to improve the accuracy of stock assessments which
are the foundation for state, interstate and federal management
of this species. An ultrasonic tracking study which is
determining the spatial and temporal distribution of young adult
red drum in the spawning stock will conclude this fall. This
extensive fishery independent research provides scientific
information for state, interstate, and federal management of
these important sciaenids mandated pursuant to O.C.G.A.
27-4-130.1, Board of Natural Resources Rules 391-2-4, P.L.
94-265, and P.L. 103-206.</p>

<p> With increased saltwater angling consequent with Georgia's
expanding coastal populations, proactive management and quality
fishing experiences are essential for the resources and our
constituency (i.e. customers). Inshore marine recreational
fisheries enhancement activities entail access development for
boating and non-boating anglers, and improved fishing
opportunities through development of inshore artificial reefs.
The Recreational Fisheries Program is improving coastal fishing
for boating and non-boating anglers by constructing fixed and
floating docks at existing boat ramp sites coastwide.
Deteriorating ramps are targeted for repairs. Program associates
are contracting a cost effective conversion of an existing
shoreside structure into a public pier. Boating access
enhancement is mandated under the Federal Aid in Sportfish
Restoration Program (mandadatory 12.5% expenditure of State's
federal SFR funding). Boating access activities coupled with the
other non-mandatory development activities are extremely
beneficial economically ($250 million annually) to the local
coastal communities and the state overall.</p>

<p> Recreational Fisheries Program associates are engaged in a
number of exclusively State supported marine education
activities, including expansion of CRH Nature Trail resources,
hosting the annual parent-child fishing derby, and field
demonstrations and presentations to numerous school groups, civic
and conservation associations. Associates assist in the
collection of finfish samples for LCP-related contaminants
analyses (LCP is a superfund site located in the coastal zone of
Brunswick). A Program biologist performs law enforcement duties
in a pilot effort to expand coastal enforcement capabilities.
Recreational Fisheries Program associates actively liaison with
sportfishing clubs, and conservation organizations, academia, law
enforcement, and other state and federal agencies in their
research and management endeavors. Program biologists represent
the agency on six state/federal ASMFC and SAFMC work groups,
technical committees, and task forces, three of which are
associated with interstate and federal fishery management
programs, and as such, are federally supported. This involvement
is in fulfillment of agency obligations through the ACFCMA and
the Council Liaison Grant. Recreational Fisheries Program
activities are supported by both state and Federal funding
sources; Federal funds are both competitive and non-competitive
grant sources.</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> The Commercial Fisheries Program is comprised of 12
associates (three biologists, senior lab technician, three
research vessel crew, five hourly wage technicians) who are
actively engaged in research, monitoring and surveys associated
with management of Georgia's $25 million (dockside) crustacean
fisheries. Crustacean management involves ongoing monitoring of
shrimp and blue crab stocks utilizing a variety of gear aboard
CRD's Research Vessel ANNA and smaller craft to provide data for
season and area management decisions mandated pursuant to
O.C.G.A. Title 27. Shrimp trawl bycatch is currently being
analyzed during CRD's fishery independent crustacean assessment
study as well as during commercial food shrimping operations in
nearshore waters. Bycatch data are integral to enhanced finfish
stock assessments and necessary for evaluating and documenting
compliance with bycatch reduction essential to effective
interstate marine fishery resource conservation and mandatory
pursuant to the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management
Act of 1993.</p>

<p> Program professionals collaborate with Wildlife Resources
Division and National Marine Fisheries Service associates to
effect management strategies to minimize the interaction of
commercial trawl and gill net fisheries with endangered and
threatened species. The Commercial Fisheries Program is also
responsible for periodic collection of seafood samples from the
Purvis Creek/Turtle River closure area for contaminants analyses.</p>

<p> In conducting its activities, the Commercial Fisheries
Program manages for optimum yield, stock conservation, and
maintaining or restoring essential habitat quality. Achievement
of these goals is based on a foundation of management-oriented
research, monitoring and modeling, real-time decision making,
policy formulation, and development of legislative and regulatory
initiatives and recommendations to authorities responsible for
habitat quality and function. Program associates actively liaison
with citizens advisory groups, academia, conservation
organizations, law enforcement, and other state and federal
agencies in their research and management endeavors. Commercial
Fisheries Program biologists represent the agency on nine
interagency, state/federal, ASMFC, and SAFMC works groups,
technical committees, and task forces.</p>

<p> Commercial Fisheries Program associates also conduct numerous
public relations activities (e.g. 10 - 20 demonstration trawls)
for VIP's, agency and elected officials, conservation and service
organizations, and school groups throughout the year. Commercial

<h2>GEORGIA'S SPOTTED SEATROUT</h2>

<p>Contact: Nick Nicholson <a
href="mailto:nick@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us">
nick@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us</a></p>

<p> Phone:(912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Spotted seatrout, a member of the Sciaenidae or drum family,
is the most targeted inshore sportfish species in Georgia. Known
as the drum family for their ability to make drumming sounds with
their air bladder, this group also includes red drum, black drum,
spot, weakfish and croaker. Spotted seatrout is identified as
having sharp canines, silvery body, with numerous distinct dark
spots on the upper side of its body, including the dorsal and
caudal fins. It occurs from Massachusetts to the Yucatan
peninsula.</p>

<p> Spotted seatrout reach sexual maturity at two years of age
with young fish spawning approximately 100,000 eggs while older
fish may spawn as many as 1,000,000. Spotted seatrout have a
protracted spring and summer spawning period which peaks in
Georgia during May. Spawning occurs primarily in the sounds along
the beaches. The eggs are buoyant and when hatched, the larval
fish are transported into the estuarine nursery areas by wind and
tidal currents.</p>

<p> Spotted seatrout are a schooling species and are
opportunistic carnivores whose feeding habits vary with size.
Juvenile trout feed initially on zooplankton, then primarily on
small crustaceans. Medium sized trout feed on shrimp and small
fish. Large fish (16+ inches) feed almost exclusively on other
fish (mullet, menhaden, etc.).</p>

<p> Tagging studies have shown that spotted seatrout are almost
estuarine specific and very few individuals exhibit movement
outside their natal estuary. Spotted seatrout prefer fringe areas
adjacent to banks, points, jetties and sand bars. In the spring
and summer, they can be located in their spawning areas near or
along beaches. As fall sets in and temperature drops, they move
into the lower sound where there is an abundance of prey. As
winter sets in they move further up the estuary into the upper
rivers and creeks, again, where there is a sufficient food
supply. With the onset of harsh weather, trout often move into
the deeper holes and channels where there is some protection from
the rapid temperature changes occurring in their usual fringe
habitat.</p>

<p> While large spotted seatrout are tolerant of extremes in
temperature and salinity, juvenile fish are susceptible to sudden
changes. Severe cold snaps and hurricanes can have a disastrous
effect, reducing the number of fish available to anglers the
following year(s). Regulations concerning the take of spotted
seatrout consist of a minimum size limit of 12 inches, and a
creel limit of 25 fish per person per day. This allows the
species to spawn at least once before harvest, thereby reducing
recovery time from severe climatic events. With a rapidly growing
coastal population, there is some concern over the stability of
our seatrout populations. It has been suggested to increase the
minimum size limit to 14 inches. This would allow the species to
spawn two or three times before reaching harvestable size,
ensuring a more stable population and rapid recovery from severe
climatic events. It would impact anglers the first year
implemented as there would be a one-year lag time for the year
class to reach harvestable size.</p>

<p> Recreational harvest of spotted seatrout in Georgia averages
over 475,000 fish per year. For the future of sportfish, we hope
all anglers will voluntarily comply with sportfishing
regulations. Conservation today will mean fishing opportunities
tomorrow.</p>

<h1>Georgia's Red Drum</h1>

<p>Contact: Spud Woodward </p>

<p> Phone:(912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), locally referred to as
channel or spottail bass, ranges from Laguna Madre, Mexico in the
Gulf of Mexico to Massachusetts in the Atlantic Ocean. Red drum
is one of 22 members of the family Sciaenidae found along the
Atlantic and Gulf coast of the United States. This group is
commonly known as the drum or croaker family since many of its
members, including red drum, produce drumming sounds by vibrating
their swim (air) bladders with special muscles. Adult red drum
are elongate, silvery red fish with a distinguishing black spot
at the base of the caudal (tail) fin above the lateral line.
However, young red drum may occasionally have numerous spots on
their sides.</p>

<p> Red drum are eurythermal, occurring over a temperature range
of 36-92oF, although they usually move into deeper water during
extremes. Small red drum less than 6-8 inches in length are more
susceptible to the effects of winter cold waves than larger
juveniles and adults. High red drum mortality during freezes
occurs with the ability to decimate large portions of juvenile
year classes.</p>

<p> Primarily found in estuarine and ocean waters, red drum are
somewhat catadromous meaning they may be found in freshwater but
must return to saltwater to spawn. After maturation, adult red
drum spend less time in the estuaries and more time in the ocean.
Red drum typically reach maturity at age four when approximately
32 inches in length and may live more than forty years.</p>

<p> Spawning normally occurs from July through October and takes
place primarily at major river inlets such as the Altamaha River.
Red drum are dioecious (i.e., distinct males and females) and
fertilization occurs externally. Red drummay spawn several times
throughout the spawning season. Spawning ocurs at night in
estuarine waters exhibiting optimum incubation salinities of
25-35 ppt below which the eggs would sink and above which the
eggs would clump together (Note: Salinity of freshwater is zero
and offshore ocean salinity is typically 35-36 parts per thousand
salt). In addition, optimum spawning occurs at temperatures of
72-86oF. Red drum eggs and larvae are carried through tidal and
current movement into estuarine systems. Increased spawning
activity is associated with new and full moon periods during the
spawning season.</p>

<p> Red drum larvae and young juveniles move into the mid and
upper portions of the estuary and generally remain in these areas
until Spring when approximately 8-10 months of age (6-10 inches
in length). In Spring, the young juveniles disperse throughout
the estuarine system and may be found occasionally in near
offshore waters. Juveniles and subadults typically remain in
estuarine waters for 3-5 years until reaching maturity (28-32
inches in length). </p>

<p> Red drum is a popular saltwater sportfish throughout the
southeastern United States and has been subject to increasing
pressure from a growing marine recreational fishery in Georgia.
Results from recreational fisheries surveys conducted by the
National Marine Fisheries Service and the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) indicate approximately two million red
drum have been caught by Georgia anglers in the past ten years.
During this same period, the number of saltwater fishing trips in
Georgia increased twofold. Research studies conducted by DNR
indicate that since the 1970's, Georgia's red drum population has
experienced a dramatic decrease in the number of young red drum
surviving to maturity. The bulk of the adult population consists
of red drum 15-25 years of age; very few adults less than 12
years of age exist. As these older adult red drum die off,
inadequate numbers of young adults exist to maintain the adult
population, possibly resulting in drastic declines in red drum
reproduction and numbers of young produced. </p>

<h1> Offshore Artificial Reef Development </h1>

<h2> Outer Continental Shelf Program</h2>

<h3> Henry Ansley, Program Leader</h3>

<p> <img src="art/green.gif"><a href="reefs.htm"> Georgia
Artificial Reef Guide</a></p>

<p> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Artificial Reef Development/Maintenance</h2>

<p> Continuing coastal development and growth has not only placed
more pressure on Georgia's marine fisheries, but also has created
a demand for increased angling opportunities. Direct expenditures
by saltwater fishermen in Georgia have been estimated at $53.4
million annually. With the number of anglers doubling since 1981,
the total impact of Georgia's marine recreational fishing
industry is now estimated at $250 million annually.</p>

<p> Georgia's continental shelf is characterized by mostly barren
sand bottom. Within this 4,000 square miles of ocean floor, only
an estimated 5% offers habitat for offshore gamefish. Creation of
manmade, or artificial, reefs is a proven management technique
that can significantly enhance the size and availability of fish
populations, as well as improve their accessibility to fishermen.
In 1970, the state of Georgia began a program designed to create
closer, safer offshore recreational fishing opportunities and
additional fisheries habitat. In further attempts to make the
offshore artificial more safely accessible to small vessels,
nearshore reef construction on six permitted sites 5-8 nm
offshore and adjacent to marked channels was initiated in 1989.
By 1996, construction had begun on five of the nearshore sites;
combined with the artificial reefs developed further offshore,
the number of offshore artifical reefs currently now totals 13
artificail reefs located 5- 23 miles offshore. Materials utilized
to construct the reefs include surplus vessels, tires, concrete,
and designed fishery enhancement units. Each reef is marked by a
state-maintained buoy.</p>

<p> In addition to providing additional recreational
opportunities and increasing fisheries habitat, properly
constructed artificial reefs also provide significant economic
benefits. Current estimates indicate that the thirteen offshore
artificial reefs constructed by DNR may generate an $5-7 million
annually, a significant return on a total construction investment
of approximately $1.5 million (federal &amp; state) over 26
years. For these reasons, a primary DNR goal is improvement and
expansion of coastal fishing opportunities through the
construction of a series of offshore, nearshore, and inshore
artificial reefs.</p>

<p> <em>Offshore/Nearshore Artificial Reef Development</em></p>

<p> Although only an estimated 15%-20% of the state's marine
recreational fishery in terms of total participants, Georgia's
offshore recreational fishery's economic impact is
disproportionately high. This fishery continues to expand due to
coastal development, the increased affordability of larger
boats/electronics, and the creation of an offshore artificial
reef system. This expansion, however, has also generated demands
for additional and more accessible opportunities similar to those
provided by Georgia's existing offshore and nearshore artificial
reefs.</p>

<p> Georgia's offshore artificial reef development program has
relied almost entirely on the availability of &quot;materials of
opportunity&quot;, such as donated/surplused vessels and scrap
concrete. Annual funding for the program has also been erratic
and insufficient. Both factors hinder the long-term planning
needed to conduct an effective offshore/nearshore artificial reef
development program coastwide.</p>

<p> In order to address the increasing demands of Georgia's
offshore recreational fishery, existing nearshore and offshore
artificial reefs need to be expanded and additional sites need to
be developed. Suitable materials of opportunity need to be
located and, if possible, barge/tug accessible staging sites must
be located for these materials. Construction components may have
to be designed and constructed, incorporating a variety of
materials. While staging/pre-placement preparations may be
conducted throughout the year, actual deployment operations
should occur, if possible, during the summer months to take
advantage of seasonally better weather/sea conditions.</p>

<p> <em>Offshore/Nearshore Artificial Reef Maintenance</em></p>

<p> Despite the availability and sophistication of today's
navigational electronics, Georgia anglers still rely and utilize
buoys placed and maintained by the state at the offshore
artificial reefs. Consisting of comparatively large buoy systems
to offer better visibility and resistance to dragging caused by
vessels illegally tying to the buoys, placement costs are
typically higher. Ongoing and emergency maintenance is required
throughout the year to ensure system integrity. Adequate
materials must be stockpiled to enable rapid replacement of buoys
lost to ship collisions, hurricanes, and other causes. Scoping
meetings conducted in 1996 regarding continued funding for
buoying of the offshore artificial reefs revealed strong support
in continuing buoying.</p>

<p> Permitted through the United States Coast Guard, the
state-maintained buoys help anglers locate and utilize the
offshore artificial reefs, as well as enhance safety by providing
important navigational backups. This is especially true for
smaller, less-equipped vessels, novice fishermen, and visitors.
The markers also provide visual delineation of the reef sites for
large vessels and, since many of the reefs are Special Management
Zones (SMZ), aid in enforcement efforts. Activities such as fish
trapping and trawling are prohibited on artificial reefs
designated as SMZ's</p>

<h1> Offshore Bottom Mapping Project</h1>

<h2> Outer Continental Shelf Program</h2>

<h3> Henry Ansley, Program Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Offshore Bottom Survey</h2>

<p>Reef fish constitute one of the South Atlantic's most
important recreational and commercial offshore fisheries. A
primary factor affecting the distribution and extent of this
fishery is the occurrence of natural reefs, known off Georgia as
&quot;hardbottoms&quot; or &quot;live bottoms&quot;. North of
Florida, live bottoms reefs are scattered and are largely less
than 3' in relief, possibly subject to periodic inundation by
sand; off Georgia, the occurrence of live bottom on the adjacent
continental shelf is estimated at only 3-5% of the total area and
typically is found well offshore, beyond safe range of most
smaller boats. Without resources to effectively search for
additional nearshore opportunities, Georgia's offshore anglers
and divers heavily utilize the state's artificial reefs and known
live bottom areas and wrecks closer to shore. As a result,
fishing pressure has become concentrated and associated reef
fisheries have radically declined.</p>

<p> Management of the important South Atlantic reef fisheries in
large part relies on protection of the live bottoms throughout
the region. Without locational information, fisheries managers
lack the basic data needed to monitor reef fisheries and respond
to potential impacts associated with new gear types and offshore
mineral exploration.</p>

<p> In order to distribute fishing pressure, live bottoms,
wrecks, and other structures offering potential fishing
opportunities need to be defined and made available. Location of
these areas will better enable fisheries managers to monitor the
region's offshore reef fisheries and its habitat, as well as
enable improved response to overfishing and other potential
impacts.</p>

<h1> Offshore Finfish Monitoring Project </h1>

<h2> Outer Continental Shelf Program</h2>

<h3> Henry Ansley, Program Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Georgia's offshore marine recreational fishery encompasses an
array of finfish targeted by anglers, divers, and other user
groups. Of primary importance are the coastal pelagic
(&quot;mackerel&quot;) and snapper/grouper fisheries associated
with the offshore artificial and natural reefs. Less prominent
fisheries occurring offshore of Georgia include billfishes,
tunas, and sharks, as well as species more typically associated
with inshore fisheries, such as bluefish, red/black drum, and
sheepshead.</p>

<p> Offshore recreational landings data for Georgia are limited.
An independent, shelfwide assessment effort for Georgia is not
feasible. Regional charter surveys and habitat assessment efforts
are also limited and are not available for the nearshore/offshore
reefs frequented by fishermen. As a result, fisheries managers
must make decisions largely based on extremely limited or
incomplete data.</p>

<p> More offshore assessment data are needed to strengthen
existing stock assessments and formulate appropriate management
strategies. Ongoing regional assessment and surveys should be
suppplemented by DNR wherever possible. A limited finfish
monitoring program focusing on selected reefs could also provide
useful background on trends in relative abundances of offshore
finfish. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Stock Assessement / Life History</h2>

<p> <em>Snapper/Grouper</em></p>

<p> The South Atlantic Snapper/Grouper Fishery management unit is
made up of 73 finfish species, encompassing snappers, groupers,
porgies, sea basses, triggerfishes, jacks, and others. According
to the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), at
least 13 species are presently overfished, approximately 14
additional species are thought to be overfished, and more species
are expected to experience overfishing in the near future.
Included are several important gamefish popular with Georgia's
offshore anglers, such as gag/scamp groupers, red/vermilion
snappers, red porgy, greater amberjack, gray triggerfish, and
black sea bass. </p>

<p> Despite the existence of highly developed fisheries,
surprisingly little is known about the life histories of the
species making up the snapper/grouper complex. Baseline
information describing movement, spawning/aggregating behavior,
age structure, exploitation, and similar data is lacking. As
stated by the SAFMC (1991): &quot;Adequate management has been
hindered by lack of current and accurate biological, statistical,
social, and economic information. Data necessary to document
growth and/or recruitment overfishing...are very limited.&quot;
With only limited information, fisheries managers have
implemented creel and minimum size limits; harvest of some
species is now illegal. Future management measures now being
considered include, trip limits, limited entry, additional creel
limits and further seasonal/area closures and quotas.</p>

<p> Basic information on the snapper/grouper fishery off Georgia
is critically needed by South Atlantic management agencies. In
light of the scope of the work and the distribution of the
fishery, cooperative regional assessment and research efforts
constitute the most practical and cost-effective approach needed
to address this problem. Where possible, Georgia facilitates and
supplements South Atlantic research efforts, focusing on species
important to the state's offshore anglers, including gag, scamp,
red snapper, greater amberjack, black sea bass, and red porgy. </p>

<p> Working with South Carolina DNR and other regional agencies,
the Outer Continental Shelf Program is currently focusing on gag
movement and spawning aggregations, which are extremely
susceptible to overfishing. This study hopes to help determine
whether gag movement, possibly in response to spawning, is
inshore-offshore, southward/northward, or a combination of the
two.</p>

<h1> Inshore Artificial Reef Development </h1>

<p> Inshore, popular gamefish are heavily targeted on well known
&quot;drops&quot;, primarily consisting of naturally occurring
oyster mounds and similarly encrusted structures that offer
habitat; however, these areas are limited throughout Georgia's
estuaries and are distant to many anglers. Further, many areas
offer only expanses of sand or mud bottom that will not support
oyster mound development due to the lack of needed hard
substrate.</p>

<p> Early experimentation in the late 1960's with inshore
artificial reef construction in Georgia was erratic until a more
recent program utilizing fabricated PVC/concrete structures was
initiated in the late 1980's. To date, four subtidal and seven
intertidal inshore reefs have been successfully constructed in
Georgia's estuaries, with the construction of an eighth reef
underway. The boundary of each reef is marked by corner pilings
and signs maintained by the state.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Inshore Artificial Reef Development/Maintenance</h2>

<p> As the trend for population expansion in coastal Georgia
continues, a greater number of people are taking advantage of the
waterways and natural resources Georgia has to offer. Boat
registrations in Georgia have increased 33% over the last ten
years. In the six coastal counties there is one registered boat
for every 15 people as compared to one in 24 residents statewide.
Creel and other fishery-dependent surveys indicate that this
increase means even greater fishing pressure on Georgia's inshore
marine recreational fisheries, the largest of the state's coastal
fisheries in terms of participants.</p>

<p> In an effort to disperse the fishing pressure and improve
fish stocks, inshore artificial reefs are needed to create more
habitat. Experimental reefs in St. Simons and Wassaw Sound have
demonstrated that inshore artificial reefs consisting of selected
materials and properly designed/sited are effective in creating
needed habitat. Presently restricted to two estuarine systems,
development of a coastwide system of small inshore artificial
reefs will help address the increasing angling pressure on
Georgia's inshore marine fisheries.</p>

<p> Georgia's inshore reefs are sited in shallow waters often
adjacent to navigational channels. The United States Coast Guard
requires clear designation of the reef sites. To accomplish this,
pilings marked with warning signs are placed at the periphery to
mark the boundaries of the inshore artificial reefs. Placement
and ongoing maintenance of additional systems will be necessary
with increased inshore artificial reef development.</p>

<h1> Access Enhancement </h1>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries Program</h2>

<h3> John Pafford, Program Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Increased marine-based recreational activity is associated
with Georgia's expanding coastal population. Consequently, one of
the primary goals of DNR's strategic planning initiatives is to
improve coastal fishing by improving existing boating and
non-boating access as well as construction of additional access.
Construction of fixed and floating docks at existing boat ramps
sites is needed coastwide to serve non-boating anglers, as well
as the boating public. Ramps with floating docks greatly enhance
the boat launching activities by improving safety and reducing
the risk of boat, trailer, and vehicle damage. Many of Georgia's
coastal boat ramps need repairs to enable adequate access at low
tide. In addition, new ramps are needed due to growing coastal
populations and increasing tourism.</p>

<p> Georgia's 100-mile coast includes more than 2,400 miles of
tidal creeks and rivers; 8,000 square miles of continental shelf;
374,000 acres of tidal marsh; and 184,000 acres of tidal waters.
Residents and tourist alike seek shore-based access to these
saltwater resources for fishing, crabbing, and castnetting.
Because of limited time most coastal residents and visitors have
to fish, they depend on easy access. In addition, lower income
families are largely dependent on non-boating angling access.</p>

<p> Despite this demand and the magnitude of the resources,
shore-based access is limited since most creeks and rivers are
typically separated from high ground by large expanses of
saltmarsh. Further, most suitable high ground adjacent to
saltwater creeks and rivers is privately owned (and highly
valued). For these reasons, public piers are critically needed
coastwide to allow citizens reasonable access to common property
resources.</p>

<p> The benefits of improved angler access and marine
recreational fishing in general are well documented. In the past
10 years, the number of participants in Georgia's marine
recreational fishery has significantly increased with
approximately a half million anglers participating during 1994.
Boat registrations in Georgia have increased 33% since 1981. In
the six coastal counties there is one boat registered for every
15 people as compared to one in 24 statewide. The total economic
impact of saltwater recreational fishing is estimated at more
than $250 million annually. Adequate boating and non-boating
access results in quality fishing trips which translates into
economic benefits to the local coastal communities and the state
overall.</p>

<h1> Inshore Sportfish Monitoring </h1>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries Program</h2>

<h3> John Pafford, Program Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Georgia enjoys a good reputation among saltwater anglers.
Regional estimates indicate that Georgia's anglers, on the
average, land more spotted seatrout than those in South Carolina,
North Carolina, and Northeast Florida combined. This is due, in
part, to effective management of the State's marine fishery
resources. Georgia's coastal population has increased 12% in the
past decade with angling effort reaching unprecedented levels.
Only through progressive fishery management based on
comprehensive and accurate information will quality saltwater
fishing opportunities be perpetuated.</p>

<p> Including stock assessement and life history studies,
research and fishery-independent surveys provide information on
exploitation rates, annual survival, movement, growth, age
composition, reproductive biology, stock structure, and general
health of fish populations. Presently, this information is only
being collected for spotted seatrout and red drum in two of
Georgia's ten estuarine systems per year. </p>

<h1> Angler Education</h1>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries Program</h2>

<h3> Spud Woodward, Project Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Angler Education</h2>

<p>Coastal Georgia is blessed with abundant and diverse estuarine
and marine fishery resources. Georgia's 100-mile coastline
includes more than 2,400 miles of tidal creeks and rivers; 8,000
square miles of continental shelf; 374,000 acres of tidal marsh;
and 184,000 acres of tidal waters. This environment serves as
habitat to a myriad of marine and estuarine finfish, crustaceans,
shellfish, marine mammals, and sea turtles that are of
recreational, commercial, and nonconsumptive importance to
Georgians and visitors to the state's six coastal counties.</p>

<p> Rapid population and urbanization of Georgia's coastal area
has led to the deterioration of estuarine/marine habitats and
stressed those natural resources dependent on them. Increased
fishing pressure has also stressed numerous marine and estuarine
living resources. The public must be educated about the value and
need for protecting essential fishery habitats from developmental
encroachments and the damaging effects of pollution. Education
about conservation of sportfish resources is another important
element in a public marine education program. A conservation
ethic needs to be instilled in the citizenry, young and old, to
maintain the quality of our marine and estuarine resources for
present and future generations.</p>

<p> Major objectives of a Marine Education Program for the next
five years are: l) promoting and enhancing the public's
understanding of and appreciation for marine resources and
environments; 2) implementing long-term educational strategies
targeting youth and adults and pertaining to marine sportfish
conservation, restoration, and utilization; 3) cultivating a
stewardship ethic for common property resources among marine
resource users; and 4) generating more responsible marine
fishermen through training in the understanding of marine
resource management techniques.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Sportfish Research Video</h2>

<p>A key to conserving the State's marine resources for current
and future generations is the education of Georgia's populace.
Georgia's coastal region and associated living resources and
ecosystems are a treasure yet to be discovered and enjoyed by
much of its citizenry. Implementation of a comprehensive marine
education program targeting youth and adults would educate
Georgians about the state's valuable, unique living coastal,
marine, and estuarine resources and habitats, as well as the need
to conserve these valuable resources and the management
techniques required to accomplish this.</p>

<p> Coastal Resources Division plans to develop a video on
Georgia sportfish research and management to promote better
understanding of how fisheries information is gathered, life
histories of selected sportfish species, and regulatory
approaches to management of sportfish species. This will help
generate a populace (youth and adults) with a greater
appreciation of the marine environment, fishery resources,
conservation principles and ethics, and the knowledge necessary
to advocate management of their resource for the present and the
future. </p>

<h2>MEASURING SALTWATER FISH</h2>

<p> Length, creel, and seasonal limits are being used to manage
saltwater finfish in coastal Georgia. Many anglers, particularly
novices, find these harvest regulations somewhat confusing. For
instance, in freshwater, anglers measure most fish using a total
length method. However, in saltwater, fish are measured using a
variety of techniques. A spotted seatrout, which has a deeply
forked and rigid tail, is measured using the fork length
technique. A billfish, such as a sailfish, is also measured using
the fork length technique; however, the measurement is taken from
the tip of the lower jaw to the fork of the tail. In many cases
finfish which have rigid forked tails will suffer damage to their
tails during transport from offshore fishing grounds.
Consequently, if all saltwater fish were measured using the
method, the angler might find themselves in a situation where the
fish they caught was legal, but when that same fish was measured
by a wildlife officer at the dock it would not be the same
length. Therefore, fishery managers have formulated length
regulations based on specific characteristics of the different
saltwater fish.</p>

<h1>Safe Boating</h1>
<em>

<p>BOATING SAFETY ZONES</em></p>

<p> The following areas have been designated as boating safety
zones and it is unlawful to operate a power boat within areas 1
through 4 below, and any boat within areas 5 and 6 below. Area 7
pertains to motors in excess of 10 horsepower.</p>

<p> 1. Jekyll Island, for a distance of 1,000 feet seaward from
the high water mark on Jekyll beach from the north end of the
island to the south end.</p>

<p> 2. Tybee Island Beach, for a distance of 1,000 feet seaward
from the high water mark on Tybee beach from the north end of the
island to the south end.</p>

<p> 3. St. Simons Island, for a distance of 1,000 feet seaward
from the high water mark on St. Simons beach from the north end
of the island to the south end.</p>

<p> 4. Sea Island, for a distance of 1,000 feet seaward from the
high water mark on Sea Island beach from the north end of the
island to the south end.</p>

<p> 5. The area within the marked boundary of any designated
swimming area.</p>

<p> 6. The area upstream or downstream of any dam designated by
the Commissioner. These areas will be marked with signs and/or
buoys.</p>

<p> 7. Motors in excess of 10 horsepower are prohibited on the
Ogeechee River from the bridge at Georgia Highway 119 upstream.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>Trailer Launching Boats</em><p. georgia's coastal creeks and
rivers consist primarily of mud and sand bottoms. with the
current velocities produced by daily tides ranging from 6 to 8
feet, this type of substrate often gives way to erosion problems
which may create a steep drop-off at the foot of many boat ramps.
therefore, boaters should take caution when launching boats
during low tide periods to insure that adequate ramp surface
extends out far enough to safely back trailers when launching
boats. <p> <em>Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs)</em></p>

<p> Personal flotation devices are an important safety item and
should be carried aboard all boats. PFDs, one for each passenger,
are required on all boats. Regulations may differ among states so
be sure to check state requirements.</p>

<p> There are several types of PFDs including:</p>

<p> 1. Life Preservers (Type I) are designed in such a way that,
even if injured or unconscious, the wearer's face remains out of
the water. Type I is the most effective for long exposure in
rough water.</p>

<p> 2. Buoyant Vests (Type II) are designed to turn an
unconscious person face up or slightly backward in the water.</p>

<p> 3. Special Purpose Devices (Type III) are designed so a
conscious person can float in a vertical or slightly backward
position and keep their head above water.However, the Type III
PFD has little or no turning ability and may not turn an
unconscious person upright in the water.</p>

<p> 4. Throwable Devices (Type IV) are designed to throw to
people in the water. Type IV PFDs do not give protection
available from a wearable type device.</p>

<p> 5. Restricted Special Purpose Device (Type V) is any PFD
approved by the U.S. Coast Guard for restricted use on vessels
used for a specific activity such as canoeing, rafting, kayaking,
sail boarding, or for commercial uses. Typically an inflatable,
wearable device.</p>

<p> <em>U.S. Coast Guard Regulations for PFDs</em></p>

<p> 1. Boats sixteen (16) feet or over in length must be equipped
with one Type I, II, or III (Wearable PFD) for each person on
board or being towed on water skis, plus one Type IV (Throwable)
in case someone falls overboard.</p>

<p> 2. Boats less than sixteen (16) feet in length, and all
canoes and kayaks, must be equipped with one Type I, II, or III
PFD for each person on board or being towed on water skis, etc.</p>

<p> 3. A Type V PFD may be carried in lieu of any PFD, but only
if the Type V PFD is approved for the activity in which the boat
is being used. U.S. Coast Guard approved inflatable, wearable
device.</p>

<p> Any person being towed on water skis, aquaplane, surfboard or
any similar device is required to wear a ski belt, ski jacket, or
a Type I, II, or III U.S. Coast Guard approved personal
floatation device.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>Fire Extinguisher</em></p>

<p> Fire on a boat is one of the skipper's greatest fears and one
of the major causes of damage to boats. For protection all boats
should carry fire extinguishers approved by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Fire extinguishers must be readily accessible, and must at all
times be kept in condition for immediate and effective use.</p>

<p> Fire extinguishers are classified by letters and numbers
according to the type and size fire they can put out. The letter
indicates the type of fire: &quot;A&quot; for combustible solids
like wood; &quot;B&quot; for flammable liquids; and &quot;C&quot;
for electrical fires. The following fire extinguishing materials
can be used to put out various types of fire on boats:</p>

<p> Fire Extinguisher Type Type Fire Carbon Dioxide (CO2) (A,B,C)
Halon/Freon (A,B,C) Dry Chemical (B,C) Foam (B) Water (A)</p>

<p> Some boat fires involve burning wood and paper and can be put
out with water. Do not use water on gasoline, oil, or electrical
fires! Water will cause a gasoline or oil fire to spread or cause
an electrical shock. Adequate fire extinguishers must be aboard
vessels mechanically-propelled according to the size- class of
the vessel. In Georgia, the fire extinguisher requirements for
each boat size- class are as follows:</p>

<p> When No Fixed Fire When a Fixed Fire Boat Boat Extinguisher
System Extinguisher System Class Length (ft) In Engine Space
Installed In Engine Space A Less than 16 One B-I None 1 16 to 26
One B-I None 2 26 to 40 Two B-I or one B-II One B-I 3 40 or more
Three B-I or one B-I Two B-I or one B-II and one B-II CARBON DRY
EXTINGUISHER FOAM DIOXIDE CHEMICAL FREON (Type-Size) (Min Gals)
(Min Pounds) (Min Pounds) (Min Pounds) B-I 1 1/4 4 2 2 1/2 B-II 2
1/2 15 10 -</p>

<p> Open runabouts of Class &quot;A&quot; and Class &quot;1&quot;
shall not be required to be equipped with fire extinguishers
provided the construction of such vessel will not permit the
entrapment of explosive or flammable gases or vapors.</p>

<p> Extinguishers should never be tried merely to see if they are
in proper operating condition because in many cases the valves
may not properly reseal, resulting in a gradual discharge of the
extinguishing agent. After using an extinguisher, recharge it as
soon as possible and before using the boat again.</p>

<p> <em>Ventilation</em></p>

<p> Regulations require ventilation of all closed engine and fuel
tank compartments if gasoline is used for fuel. Exhaust blowers
are installed in engine compartments so that gasoline fumes can
be removed before engines are started. Gasoline vapors can
explode if engines are started before blowers are allowed to
operate for four (4) minutes to remove fumes.</p>

<p> <em>Whistles and Horns</em></p>

<p> All boats should carry some type of sound-producing equipment
for signaling. Sound-producing equipment may be needed for
emergencies, fog or heavy rain conditions, or maneuvering in
heavy boat traffic. In Georgia, every boat 26 feet in length or
longer must be equipped with a whistle, horn or other
sound-producing mechanical appliance capable of producing sounds
which would warn approaching vessels of your presence.</p>

<p> <em>Lights</em></p>

<p> Any boat used between sunset and sunrise must show the lights
required by law. Failure to show necessary lights is one of the
leading causes of fatal accidents in Georgia. Remember, the motor
noise of your vessel makes it almost impossible to hear a vessel
approaching, and lights are the only way to locate a moving
vessel during hours of darkness. Even though you may not plan to
use your boat after sunset, you should have the required lights
installed for your protection. Lighting requirements will vary
according to boat size and design.</p>

<p> <em>Mirrors</em></p>

<p> All boats used for towing persons on skis, aquaplanes,
surfboards, or similar devices are required to be equipped with a
wide angle mirror or else have some person, other than the
operator, who is competent to constantly observe the person being
towed.</p>

<p> <em>WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT</em></p>

<p> The Georgia Boat Safety Act requires the operators of all
vessels involved in accidents to render such assistance as may be
practical and necessary, insofar as can be done without serious
danger to their own vessel, crew and passengers.</p>

<p> Operators of vessels involved in accidents are also required
to give their name, address, and identification of their vessel
in writing to any person injured and to the owner of any property
damaged.</p>

<p> Persons who render the aid required by law, and who
gratuitously and in good faith render assistance at the scene of
a vessel accident may not be held liable for any civil damages as
a result of the rendering of assistance, as long as such
assistance is rendered in a prudent manner.</p>

<p> A reportable boating accident is any accident which results
in loss of life or disappearance, injury sufficient to require
first aid or medical attention, or damage to vessels or other
property in excess of $500.</p>

<p> <em>SURVIVAL IN THE WATER</em></p>

<p> You may fall overboard or be forced into the water from a
boating accident. Don't panic or fight the water. Swim slowly and
easily to conserve strength. Hang onto the boat unless it is in
danger.</p>

<p> Any item that floats will help keep you afloat. In a fire or
explosion, throw anything that floats overboard. Tie a rope to
the floating gear to hold on to. If the boat is on fire you can
then float a safe distance away and not lose the boat. Floating
debris is easier to see than one person in the water.</p>

<p> Clothing can preserve body heat and help you float. Take it
off only if it hampers movement. Fasten clothing around your neck
to trap air. Keep your arms under water. If wearing trousers,
bend your legs to hold the air in around your knees. Fishermen
can use the air which is trapped in their boots to keep them
afloat.</p>

<p> You may begin to loose body heat through hypothermia. Don't
discard clothing if water is cold, clothing helps trap the body's
heat. Thrashing around in cold water only leads to exhaustion and
swirling water takes heat from the body more rapidly than still
water. If several people are in the water, huddle closely
together or if alone, fold your legs to your chest and remain as
still as possible. If you are exhausted or losing consciousness,
tie yourself to anything that floats. </p>

<p> <em>ALCOHOL ON BOARD</em></p>

<p> For many people, beer is the boat's most important cargo.
Depending on the amount consumed, alcohol can add to the day's
enjoyment or be the cause of a tragedy. It is everyone's
responsibility to control on-board drinking. The easiest way to
avoid excessive drinking is to limit the amount of alcohol you
bring on board.</p>

<p> Drinking, combined with fatigue due to glare and constant
boat motion, causes accidents. Alcohol affects balance and muscle
coordination and causes tunnel vision and inability to track
moving objects. Excessive drinking slows reaction time, increases
the tendency to take risks, and affects reasoning. People who've
had too much to drink lose the ability to judge the effects of
alcohol. Any behavior that is unusal for a particular passenger
is a danger sign (i.e. loud talking, slurred speech, clumsy
behavior, dropping or spilling things, etc.). Help insure for a
safe and enjoyable boating trip by limiting the drinking of any
person on board who shows these signs. </p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>RUNNING AGROUND</em></p>

<p> Tides levels in Georgia typically range as high as 8 feet.
Such changes in water level increases the chance of running
aground. As in all emergency situations the first thing to do is
keep calm. Usually, the first impulse is to shift immediately
into reverse, gun the engine, and attempt to back up. This could
be the wrong move. The propeller spinning in reverse may pull
more sand and mud under the keel making matters worse. Also,
continued operation may clog the cooling system with sand or mud
and cause your motor to overheat.</p>

<p> Instead, tilt up your motor. With an oar or paddle test the
bottom all around the boat. If the bottom is shallow and sandy
and it is safe to do so, get a couple of people out of the boat
and push it off. You might get results by having your passengers
move and shift their weight gently rocking the boat while it is
being pushed. Remember, with 6 to 8 foot tides, the water level
may be rapidly falling and you may have only minutes to free your
boat before it is totally grounded high and dry. For your boating
safety, it is highly recommended that you obtain a navigational
chart and study your boating area. Many coastal marinas sell
navigational charts or can tell you where to purchase one.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr>
<em>

<p>BOAT RAMP ETIQUETTE</em></p>

<p> Launching a boat can sometimes be a problem. Wind, low tide,
a slippery, steep boat ramp or other local problems may mean
hidden hazards. The boat owner can make the task easier by being
alert and following this simple procedure. Remember, courtesy and
efficiency will go a long way in making a boat trip a pleasure
for you and others too.</p>

<p> Before you get in line to launch your boat, do the following:</p>

<p> 1. Stay to one side and watch one or two launchings to notice
any problems on the ramp and the effects of wind and current on
launching. Many boat ramps in Georgia's coastal waters may have
steep drop-offs at the foot or end of the ramp. Caution should be
taken during lower tide levels.</p>

<p> 2. Remove any gear that is stored in the car. Rig and prepare
boat supplies and equipment for full operation.</p>

<p> 3. Disconnect the wiring plug between car and trailer.</p>

<p> 4. Remove tie-downs. Insure trailer winch is locked and winch
line connected to bow eye. Double check to make sure that the
drain plug is in.</p>

<p> 5. Attach a line to a bow cleat and a second line to a stern
cleat to aid in controlling the boat after launching.<p. 6. double
check engine safety chains and make sure that the outboard is
securely attached to the transom.<p> 7. Insure that all
passengers are out of the car and in a safe area away from areas
of moving vehicles and trailers.</p>

<p> 8. Back down into the water until the rear rollers or
supports are barely under the water. 9. Have someone guide you
into the water and hold onto the guide lines which you connected.</p>

<p> 10. Disconnect the winch line from the bow eye and put the
boat in the water.</p>

<p> 11. Move your boat so others may launch.</p>

<p> 12. Return your vehicle and trailer to the parking area.</p>

<h1>RECOMMENDED FISHING METHODS</h1>

<p> Many fishermen from non-coastal counties, especially those
from out-of-state, may possess limited knowledge of saltwater
fishing techniques and may be unfamiliar with Georgia's
indigenous marine sport fish species. Recreational saltwater
fishing is excellent in Georgia and every year, large numbers of
spotted seatrout, red drum, black drum, sheepshead, flounder,
whiting, spot and croaker are taken. However, anglers fishing in
unfamiliar waters that exhibit 6 to 8 foot tides may find
difficulty in learning the proven techniques necessary for
producing a good fishing experience.</p>

<p> The following recommendations are intended to provide
information on basic fishing techniques for some common sport
fish found in Georgia's coastal waters. Also, daily information
on what's biting can be obtained from most coastal marinas or
local fishing equipment and bait outlets. Phone numbers for
marinas and fish camps are provided in the county map section.</p>

<p> <em>SPOTTED SEATROUT</em></p>

<p> The most commonly used method for seatrout is drift fishing a
standard deep floating terminal rig baited with live shrimp. When
fishing with a float rig, most anglers use bait casting reels
with rods eight feet or longer. Seatrout are typically mid-water
striking feeders. Live bait such as shrimp, finger- size mullet,
mud minnows, and menhaden (pogies) are recommended. Although live
shrimp are considered the best year-round bait for seatrout, from
mid-November through March when water temperatures cool,
artificial lures such as plastic tail grubs work just as well and
oftentimes better. Fishing tackle for artificial lures usually
consists of light spinning or spin cast reels spooled with 8-10
pound line and rods six feet or longer. A number of inexpensive
lures resembling small fish may be purchased at marinas or tackle
shops. When fishing with lures, retrieve the line as slowly as
possible, allowing the lure to occasionally touch bottom.</p>

<p> Seatrout are basically schooling fish in areas with large
quantities of dead oyster shell, or near live oyster beds. They
prefer fringe areas adjacent to banks, points, jetties and bars,
but are also taken in deeper channels during cold water winter
periods, or along open waters of the beaches during spring and
summer.</p>

<p> <em>RED DRUM (Spottail Bass)</em></p>

<p> The most commonly used method for red drum fishing is a
standard deep floating terminal rig baited with live or dead
shrimp or small crabs. Although school-size red drum can be
caught year-round in inshore estuarine waters, young-of-the-year
red drum typically show up in June-August. However, fall is the
best time to catch small school-size drum. Fishing for young red
drum (<15 lb) employs the same basic tactics, gear, and areas used
to catch spotted seatrout. in addition to shrimp and fiddler
crabs, many anglers often use live finger-size mullet or mud
minnows to target medium-size red drum (5 15 lb) found on open
mud flats adjacent to large expanses of salt marsh grass. mud
minnows and small mullet may be easily collected with two-funnel
minnow traps baited with bread or a piece of fat-back bacon and
set in a tidal ditch. if the trap is left unattended for an
extended period of time, insure the area will have adequate water
depth during low tide. <p> Angling for large red drum is strictly
a surf fishing proposition. Surf fishing requires a long surf rod
for long distance casting. Most anglers use 30 pound test
monofilament line and terminal rigs consisting of 4 to 8 oz.
pyramid or egg sinkers or 3 to 4 oz. storm sinkers rigged as a
fish-finder rig with 7/0 to 9/0 standard hooks. However, with
recent size regulations requiring the release of the large-size
drum, 12/0 to 14/0 circle hooks are highly recommended. Circle
hooks are self-setting which generally results in more hook-ups
and the circle hook generally hooks in the mouth region thus
greatly reducing &quot;gut-caught&quot; drum. The most popular
bait is fresh-cut mullet and blue crabs for targeting large
(&gt;20 lb) red drum. Fish for large drum in the spring and fall
in heavy surf near inlets.</p>

<p> <em>BLACK DRUM, CROAKER and SPOT</em></p>

<p> These bottom feeders are some of the most numerous and easily
caught fish and are usually taken with a &quot;fish finder&quot;
or &quot;bottom rig&quot; baited with shrimp or fiddler crab.
They are primarily estuarine fish, abundant in Georgia's inshore
waters from April to October. Concentrations of black drum are
often found near piers, docks, jetties, bridges and areas of
naturally occurring oyster shell mounds. Croakers prefer sandy
hard bottom while spot prefer firm mud and clay bottom.</p>

<p> <em>SHEEPSHEAD</em></p>

<p> Usually found around docks, piers, jetties, and other
structures encrusted with barnacles and oysters, the sheepshead
is notorious for its ability to steal bait from the novice
angler. The recommended sheepshead rig consists of an 1/2 oz. egg
sinker, 8 to 10 inch leader, and 1/0 or 2/0 hook baited with a
fiddler crab. Hook the fiddler by inserting the barb of the hook
between the walking legs leaving the barb inside the crab.
Fiddler crabs may easily be obtained by hand from marsh sand
flats located along island causeways.</p>

<p> After lowering the baited hook to the bottom next to a piling
or encrusted structure, immediately take the slack out of the
line and very slowly raise and lower the baited hook. The least
amount of resistance or rod tip vibration should be considered a
bite. After reeling in the line and only the carapace or shell of
the fiddler crab remains on the hook, the angler will readily
appreciate the skill of this king of bait stealers. The angler
should never give up, only patience and time will provide the
necessary skills to catch the elusive sheepshead.</p>

<p> <em>FLOUNDER</em></p>

<p> Usually found in the more open flat bottom areas where
spotted seatrout and red drum concentrate, flounder are generally
caught incidentally with seatrout and red drum on standard float
rigs with live shrimp. Anglers specifically targeting flounder
also use bottom rigs consisting of a small egg sinker, swivel, 18
to 24 inch leader, and a 3/0 Kahle hook baited with active live
shrimp, mud minnows, or finger-size mullet. </p>

<h1>CATCH AND RELEASE</h1>
<em>

<p>Why Release Fish</em></p>

<p> 1. Stressed fish populations need your help to recover.</p>

<p> 2. A personal commitment to conservation adds fun to fishing.</p>

<p> 3. Size, season, and bag regulations make release mandatory.</p>

<p> 4. A fish is too valuable a resource to be caught only once.</p>

<p> 5. The future of sportfishing is in your hands. Pass it on!</p>

<p> <em>How To Begin</em></p>

<p> 1. Use hooks that are barbless and made from metals that rust
quickly. May use pliers to flatten barbs on hooks.</p>

<p> 2. Set the hook immediately. Try to prevent a fish from
swallowing the bait.</p>

<p> 3. Land your quarry quickly; don't play it to exhaustion.</p>

<p> 4. Decide to release a fish as soon as it is hooked.</p>

<p> 5. Work a fish out of deep water slowly, so it can adjust to
the pressure change.</p>

<p> 6. Always keep release tools handy.</p>

<p> <em>Handling Your Catch</em></p>

<p> 1. Leave the fish in the water (if possible) and don't handle
it. Use a tool to remove the hook or cut the leader.</p>

<p> 2. Keep the fish from thrashing.</p>

<p> 3. Net your catch only if you cannot control it any other
way.</p>

<p> 4. When you must handle a fish:</p>

<p> Use a wet glove or rag to hold it.</p>

<p> Turn a fish on its back or cover its eyes with a wet towel to
calm it.</p>

<p> Don't put your fingers in the eyes or gills of your catch.</p>

<p> (Larger fish can be kept in the water by holding the leader
with a glove or by slipping a release gaff through the lower
jaw).</p>

<p> Avoid removing mucous or scales.</p>

<p> Get the fish back in the water as quickly as possible.</p>

<p> 5. Protect against personal injury by handling each species
carefully and correctly.</p>

<p> <em>Removing the Hook</em></p>

<p> 1. Cut the leader close to the mouth if a fish has been
hooked deeply or if the hook can't be removed quickly.</p>

<p> 2. Back the hook out the opposite way it went in.</p>

<p> Use needle-nose pliers, hemostats, or a hookout to work the
hook and protect your hands.</p>

<p> 4. For a larger fish in the water, slip a gaff around the
leader and slide it down to the hook. Lift the gaff upward as the
angler pulls downward on the leader.</p>

<p> 5. Do not jerk or pop a leader to break it. This damages
vital organs and kills the fish.</p>

<p> <em>The Final Moments</em></p>

<p> 1. Place the fish in the water gently, supporting its
mid-section and tail until it swims away.</p>

<p> 2. Resuscitate an exhausted fish by moving it back and forth
or tow it alongside the boat to force water through its gills.</p>

<p> 3. Use an ice pick, needle, or hook point to puncture the
expanded air bladder on a fish taken from deep water.</p>

<p> 4. Watch your quarry to make sure it swims away. If it
doesn't, recover the fish and try again.</p>

<p> 5. Remember, a released fish has an excellent chance of
survival when handled carefully and correctly.</p>

<h2>WHOSE FISH ARE THEY, ANYHOW?</h2>

<p> Many fishermen, frustrated by unwanted regulation, wonder why
government officials have the right (or even the nerve) to tell
them how much they can catch, where and when they can catch it,
and how they can catch it. The answer is found in something
called the &quot;tragedy of the commons.&quot;</p>

<p> Hundreds of years ago, community leaders observed that when a
resources was owned by the people, no one took any responsibility
for maintaining the resource. Human nature being what it is, each
person tended to use the resource to the maximum extent. There
was little incentive to conserve or invest in the resource
because others would then benefit without contributing to the
welfare of the resource. In the case of common (public) grazing
areas in England, grass soon disappeared as citizens put more and
more sheep on the land held in common. Everyone lost as &quot;the
commons&quot; became overgrazed and this became known as
&quot;the tragedy of the commons.&quot; </p>

<p> To prevent &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot; most common
property resources are held in trust and managed for the people
by state or federal government agencies. Fish living in public
waters are such a common property resource. The government has
the responsibility of managing the fish for the benefit of all
citizens, even those who do not fish.</p>

<p> So who owns Georgia's fish? You do--along with the other
seven million citizens of the State of Georgia. In order for all
to benefit from this renewable resource, your elected officials
have vested the stewardship of these resources in the State's
Department of Natural Resources. Fish populations are managed by
agency professionals to ensure that you as well as your
children's children have the same opportunities to enjoy and
benefit from Georgia's sportfish populations. The basic goal of
the fisheries biologist is to estimate the amount of fish that
can be removed or harvested safely while leaving sufficient
numbers to keep the fish population healthy. Based on fishery
investigation findings, DNR provides regulatory recommendations
to the governing bodies.</p>

<p> Renewable resources like sportfish are living things that
replenish themselves naturally and can be harvested, within
limits, on a continuing basis without eliminating them. These
limits of harvest are controlled by fishing laws and regulations
such as size and creel limits as well as season. Therefore, for
the future of sport fishing, all anglers should voluntarily
comply with fisheries regulations. &#12;&#05; sport fishing, all
anglers should voluntarily comply with fisheries regulations.</p>

<h1>GEORGIA CRUSTACEAN REPORT</h1>

<h2>Commercial Fisheries Program</h2>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Georgia's 1995 calendar year was a very good one for the
shrimp fishery with a record harvest of roughly 7 million pounds
of penaeid shrimp worth approximately 26 million dollars. The
spring roe white shrimp season (April through June) produced 1.7
million pounds and was only 75 thousand pounds below the 1991
record year. Summer brown shrimp landings equaled the 887
thousand pound average since 1957. Fall white shrimp landings
also got off to a good start with the first million pound
September since 1979, and the third highest September ever,
including years when Georgia's sounds were open. October
landings, too, were good with 872 thousand pounds, which was also
the highest since 1979. November landings (355,227 lbs) were 40%
below the historic average since 1957, but December landings
(706,160 lbs) were 36% above average. Based on inshore abundance
and size, the 1995 season was extended beyond 31 December to
allow continued harvest. However, the cold weather in early
January moved vast quantities of small shrimp out on the beaches
and prompted the season closure on 10 January 1996. In summary,
the 1995 shrimp harvest produced the all time record for Georgia
shrimpers, but market prices ran about a dollar per pound less
for the catch.</p>

<p> Season highlights included a 30 day area closure of waters
near the Altamaha River mouth during the entire month of August
to prevent the harvest of small shrimp on the beaches. This area
was also closed during the 10 day season extension in January. On
January 24, Georgia's Board of Natural Resources adopted a
Bycatch Reduction Device (BRD) Rule requiring BRD's in shrimp
trawls, effective on the season opening on 1 June 1996. During
the season the National Marine Fisheries Service implemented its
Sea Turtle Emergency Response Plan (ERP) on two different
occasions, requiring the use of top-ejecting hard TED's in shrimp
trawls (the latter restrictions under the ERP did allow use of
bottom shooting hard TED's). Georgia's and the other South
Atlantic states' bycatch reduction plans to insure compliance
with the mandatory 50% bycatch reduction requirement of the ASMFC
Weakfish Management Plan were approved by the Weakfish Management
Board. These plans require the use of BRD's. The Georgia
Legislature passed a quantity limit of 48 quarts (heads-on or 30
quarts heads-off) per person or per boat for castnet caught
shrimp, effective February 7, 1996. This legislation was the
result of strong concerns about the development of a substantial
new inshore commercial fishery as well as the rapid increase in
the number of Florida castnetters, primarily in Camden County,
coming to Georgia as a result of Florida's 5 gallon limit for
castnetters. Finally, per the concerns of commercial food
shrimpers regarding the high turtle strandings and documented
cases of crab traps fouling TED's during the early weeks of the
shrimp season, DNR is working with both industries to try to
resolve this problem, partially through a gear recycling program
for the old traps, and partially through educating the crab
industry of this potential gear conflict.</p>

<p> Georgia's crab industry appears to have been on the rebound
for several years now with reported landings for 1995 increasing
to 9.3 million pounds equaling the long term average since 1956,
and the highest annual harvest since 1984. During the past year
much concern was expressed that there would be a surge of new
crab license sales as a result of Florida's Net Ban Referendum
and the subsequent need for those displaced small boat fishermen
having to diversify to other fisheries, e.g. Georgia's
unrestricted crab fishery. Legislation to establish a &quot;crab
license&quot; and to implement a moratorium on new license sales
until July 1997 was passed in 1995 to prevent additional
exploitation of this fishery and to allow time to develop some
form of limited access to this fishery. The new law requires a
commercial &quot;crab license&quot; to deploy more than six crab
traps, but, in turn, allows the recreational community to use
this commercial gear to harvest no more than a bushel of crabs
per person without being licensed.</p>

<p> In February 1995, the Board of Natural Resources passed a
Rule requiring that all crab traps have a minimum of two escape
rings with a minimum opening of 2 3/8 inches inside diameter to
be installed on the vertical sides of the traps. There has been
much concern regarding the impacts of this ring rule on
peeler/soft crab production, but sales this year actually
increased substantially over the previous year. A special Blue
Crab Issues Subcommittee is meeting at this time to discuss the
crab ring rule, spatial competition between crab/whelk trawlers
and crab trappers in nearshore ocean waters as well as discussing
the aforementioned gear conflicts and the general effect of
abandoned crab traps on TED's. There is also some interest being
expressed about protection of sponge crabs through a harvest
prohibition.</p>

     Federal aid coordination encompasses proposal and contractual preparation and processing;
budget formulation, monitoring, and amendments preparation; and oversight of reporting
compliance with grant obligations for seven Marine Fisheries Section grants.  They are:

     1) South Atlantic Fishery Management Council - Provide technical assistance to the South
Atlantic Fishery Management Council in the development, implementation, and monitoring of
fishery management plans and amendments to enhance fisheries management in the South
Atlantic through State/Council cooperative management of the fisheries occurring in the
Territorial Sea and Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ). <em> $30,000 Federal </em>

     2) Georgia/NMFS Regional Cooperative Statistics Program - To provide NMFS with the
harvest in pounds, and the ex-vessel and processed value (dollars) of all commercial marine
fishery resources landed in Georgia.  To satisfy data requests for commercial fisheries information
from these data sets.  To also provide NMFS with biostatistical and associated effort data on
certain commercial finfish species.  To provide finfish landings on a weekly or daily basis as
needed for species that are under federal fishery quotas. <em> $135,000 Federal </em> 

     3) Marine Fisheries Research, Surveys, and Development (USFWS/SFR) - Offshore
Bottom Survey, Annual Assessment of Red Drum Exploitation and Stock Structure, Identification
of Gag Spawning Aggregations, Spotted Seatrout Assessment, Socio-Economic Analysis of
Georgia's Marine Recreational Fishery, Offshore Fishing Reef Development &amp; Maintenance,
Inshore Fishing Reef Development &amp; Maintenance, and Fishing Pier/Platform Development &amp;
Maintenance.<em> $392,196 Federal / $130,733 State </em>

     4) Boating Access for Coastal Georgia Anglers (USFWS/SFR) - To provide new or
improved boating access to Georgia's coastal boating anglers.  To also help meet the State's
12.5% boating access obligation within each five-year period. <em> $116,681 Federal / $38,894 State </em>


     5) Fishery-Independent Assessment of Sub-Adult Red Drum in the South Atlantic Bight
(MARFIN/NMFS) - Conduct regional fishery-independent sampling and mark-recapture
experiments to provide the data needed for assessment of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) stocks
of red drum.  Secondary goals and objectives include further refinement of red drum stock
identification in the SAB, characterization of emigration and escapement from estuarine waters
to the EEZ, and a fishery-independent index of abundance for age 0 red drum. <em> $181,871 Federal /
$28,566 State </em>

     6) Assessment of Georgia's Marine Fishery Resources (IJ/NMFS) - To determine the
relative abundance, size composition, and reproductive status of Georgia's penaeid shrimp and
blue crab stocks.  Monthly fisheries-independent assessment sampling data are used to evaluate
stock status and to develop recommendations for optimum management of these important marine
resources.<em> $25,495 Federal / $8,498 State </em>

     7) Interstate Fisheries Management Planning and Implementation (ACFCMA/NMFS) -
Increase the precision level of bycatch estimates of finfish species in the commercial penaeid
shrimp trawl fishery in Georgia waters and in the EEZ off Georgia.  Provide samples for
determining the age and genetic structure of selected species occurring in the bycatch.  Collect
fishery-independent data in the inshore and nearshore waters of Georgia to compare catch rates
of selected species to rates observed during similar work in the early 1970s, and to provide
reference and supplemental collections for bycatch characterization work.  Also provide
administrative support to the State of Georgia for meeting the public information, regulatory,
legislative, and technical deliberation needs generated by the ACFCMA. <em> $89,220 Federal</em>

<h2>Floating Dock Construction at Existing Boat Ramps</h2>

<p> One of DNR's primary strategic initiatives is to improve
coastal fishing for boating anglers by constructing
fixed/floating docks at existing boat ramp sites. Considering
Georgia's 6 to 8 foot tidal amplitude, ramps with floating docks
greatly enhance boat launching by improving angler safety and
reducing boat damage. Floating docks also provide much needed
access for Georgia's non-boating public.</p>

<p> Of the 34 public boat ramps in Georgia's tidal waters, very
few are equipped with a fixed/floating dock. DNR has identified
24 of these existing ramps in need of fixed/floating dock
improvements. Public boat ramps proposed for construction of
floating dock facilities for FY-97 through FY-99 include:</p>

<h2>Boat Ramp Repair</h2>

<p> Boating access in coastal Georgia is relatively limited
overall and is woefully inadequate in some coastal counties and
population centers to meet the demands of ever-increasing
marine-based recreation. Over half of the existing public boat
ramps accessing saltwaters are in need of some degree of repair.
DNR has identified 20 boat ramps that exhibit various degrees of
deterioration, ranging from cracking and separation to extreme
erosion that prevents boat launching at low tide.</p>

<p> Many of the coastal boat ramps need repairs. Erosion from
tidal currents has resulted in dangerous drop offs at the base of
some ramps, resulting in the collapse of the lower portion of the
ramp and even loss of vehicles and trailers. Presently, DNR owns
or controls 11 public boat ramps in Georgia's saltwaters with the
remaining 23 belonging to local city or county governments.
During FY-97, efforts will be directed to surveying these coastal
ramps to identify existing conditions, set priorities, formulate
specific recommendations for repairs, and determine the most
appropriate approach for repairs.</p>

<h1>Fishing Pier Construction </h1>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries Program</h2>

<h3> John Pafford, Program Leader</h3>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Shoreside access to fishable marine and estuarine waters is
extremely limited in coastal Georgia. Despite vast acreage of
saltwaters, most creeks and rivers are separated from high ground
by large expanses of saltmarsh. There is a paucity of public deep
water access available to the non-boating public. High ground
areas suitable for construction of public fishing piers is
extremely limited in coastal Georgia. What little high ground
property is available is typically too costly to develop for
public saltwater access. The number of sites suitable for
development of non-boating fishing access is expected to decrease
while costs and public demand for providing this needed access
are expected to increase. It is imperative that DNR address
increasing non-boating access needs to meet the demand of a
growing population as well as coastal tourism. The need is
particularly acute in the northern portion of Georgia's coast.
Currently, using federal Sportfish Restoration funds and
state/local government support, DNR is constructing public
fishing piers in Chatham County.</p>

<p> Red drum and spotted seatrout are the most targeted inshore
marine sportfish in coastal Georgia. Previous research indicates
that each estuarine system has an individual population of
spotted seatrout and immature red drum. Biotelemetry studies have
revealed that adult red drum demonstrate fidelity to discrete
spawning areas. Stock assessment of red drum and spotted seatrout
requires information of exploitation, growth, fecundity (egg
production), angler harvest, and age structure.</p>

<p> MARFIN is a competitive grant program administered by the
National Marine Fisheries Service. This interstate project
involving Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina is titled
&quot; Fishery-independent Assessment of Subadult Red Drum in the
South Atlantic Bight&quot;. This was the first multi-state and
multi-year MARFIN grant awarded. The project period is from
September 1, 1994 thru August 31, 1997.</p>

<p> The objective of this project is to conduct regional
fishery-independent sampling and mark-recapture experiments to
provide the data needed for the assessment of South Atlantic
Bight (SAB) stocks of red drum. Stratified random sampling of
estuarine habitats used by red drum is being conducted in each of
the respective states using entanglement gear. Length-composition
and age-composition data are being compiled, reduced, and
analyzed to develop annual and cohort-specific mortality rates.
In addition, annual mark-recapture experiments will be used to
describe length-specific and age-specific vulnerability of red
drum within the recreational fishery. This project is being
conducted over a three year period in order to provide valid
estimates of mortality which are free of the effects of
recruitment variation. Data provided from this project will be
less biased than the fishery-dependent data currently used to
assess South Atlantic Bight red drum stocks. Any questions can be
directed to the Recreational Fisheries Program. </p>

<h1>Marine Sportfish Creel Survey</h1>

<h2>Nick Nicholson, Project Leader</h2>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Fishery-dependent data are important for regional and state
management decision-making. Current levels of effort in the
Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) are
inadequate for timely and accurate data collection. The
Recreational Fisheries Program has worked cooperatively with the
MRFSS and plans to renew this effort to expand the number of
intercepts and telephone interviews.</p>

<p> The data provided by an expanded level of effort within the
MRFSS is needed to allow state/regional fishery managers to make
more timely and valid decisions. This will allow more accurate
calculations of coastal fishing pressure and help monitor the
status of Georgia's marine recreational fishery.</p>

<h1>Socio-Economic Angler Survey</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Clark Evans, Project Leader</h2>

<p> Email: <a href="mailto:clark@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us">
clark@dnrcrd.dnr.state.ga.us </a></p>

<p> Phone: (912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Efforts to determine the economic value of Georgia's marine
recreational fishery have, to date, been limited. The most recent
economic survey was produced by the Sport Fishing Institute
utilizing data obtained from the National Survey of Fishing,
Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. As the marine
portion of the National Survey in Georgia was based on a sample
size of less than 30 individuals who saltwater fished, results
from the SFI study yielded extrapolated values that are
questionable in regards to their scope and accuracy.</p>

<p> Baseline economic data related to the marine recreational
fishery allow for the accurate determination of the economic
impacts of the fishery to the state. Additionally, this
information is essential to the determination of the economic
impacts of regulations on the fishing public.</p>

<p> Marine recreational fisheries also have value in attributes
which are less tangible or are not immediately quantifiable.
These attributes can be measured in terms of demographics,
attitudes, motivations, satisfactions, fishing behaviors,
participation rates, and management preferences. It has been
asserted that fishery managers must consider human benefits and
angler experiences as tangible elements which can be quantified
or modified. Without this key information managers lack the
ability to effectively predict the impacts of regulatory actions
on the affected user group or to determine angler acceptance of
management measures. </p>

<p> In 1990, CRD attempted to document the attitudes of Georgia
resident saltwater anglers about present and future management
issues. The study methodology employed a single survey instrument
and provided a &quot;snap shot&quot; of angler attitudes and
opinions as they were at the time of the survey. A primary
conclusion of the report noted the need to undertake additional
survey work to determine socio-economic characteristics,
demographics, and management preferences of Georgia saltwater
anglers.</p>

<p> Angler motivations, satisfactions, participation rates,
management preferences, attitudes and opinions can change over
time. A problematic aspect of investigating these factors is that
a single survey instrument will provide only a static indication
of what are essentially dynamic attributes. In an ongoing study
of Texas saltwater anglers, Texas A&amp;M University has employed
a longitudinal panel study design. A subgroup of anglers have
been surveyed twice a year since 1989. This design allows for the
identification of changes in fishing participation and management
preferences over time.</p>

<p> The ultimate success of any fisheries management policy is
dependent on the modification of human behavior, voluntary or
enforced. Therefore, managers must understand the human component
of the management equation which is essential to understanding
and implementing effective regulatory measures. An increased
understanding of the human dimension of the marine recreational
fishery is absolutely essential in the development of a
foundation for advocacy and long-term support. </p>

<p> GOALS &amp; OBJECTIVE:</p>

<p> 1) To achieve a better understanding of the socio-economic
aspects of the Georgia marine recreational fishery for purposes
of incorporation into a responsive management strategy.</p>

<p> EXPECTED RESULTS &amp; BENEFITS:</p>

<p> Information regarding the value of Georgia's marine
recreational fishery will enhance agency ability in assessing the
cost/benefit of State expenditures which is essential to the
budgeting process. Data specific to the economic expenditures of
the angler population will allow for the determination of
economic impacts of management measures. Attitudinal,
participation, motivation, satisfaction, and management
preference data will more clearly define the angler population
and will provide an indication of the acceptance of current or
proposed management measures. Additionally, gathering these data
over a period of years, via a subgroup, will provide a continuous
feedback mechanism through which long-term support and advocacy
will be fostered. </p>

<p> APPROACH:</p>

<p> Feasibility Study (FY 97): Year one of the study will be
devoted to determining the appropriate methodologies and
associated costs for statewide survey of Georgia saltwater
anglers and subsequent sub-sample surveys (Job 1). A review of
the relevant human dimensions literature will be conducted to
gather applicable research theory, survey methods, sample size
considerations, and to refine project goals and objectives.
Practical information will be gathered via interviews with state
agency and university researchers having experience with similar
surveys. Information collected from the literature review and
interviews will then be incorporated into a project methodology
specific to application in Georgia. </p>

<p> Statewide Survey (FY 98): A statewide survey of saltwater
anglers will be developed and administered to Georgia saltwater
anglers in year two (Job 2). Questions will focus on
demographics, expenditures, participation, and other issues of
importance. Survey data will be collected, reduced, and analyzed
to produce a final report containing baseline economic data,
participation rates, and demographics. This information will be
supplied to the state legislature, state fisheries managers,
citizens advisory committees, federal fisheries managers,
interstate fisheries management commissions, and the public.</p>

<p> Panel Survey I (FY 99): During year three, a representative
sub-sample, or panel, of Georgia saltwater anglers will be
developed based on the demographics of responses to the statewide
survey (Job 3). Surveys will be developed and administered twice
yearly. Questions will focus on expenditures, attitudes,
motivations, satisfactions, and management preferences for actual
and proposed measures. Survey data will be collected, reduced,
analyzed, and reported semi-annually. This information will be
made available to the state legislature, state fisheries
managers, citizens advisory committees, federal fisheries
managers, interstate fisheries management commissions, and the
public. Additionally, the panel of anglers will receive,
semi-annually, a 2-4 page synopsis of the results of each survey.</p>

<p> Panel Survey II (FY 00): Two surveys will be developed and
administered to the panel of saltwater anglers in year four (Job
4). Again, questions will focus on expenditures, attitudes,
motivations, satisfactions, and management preferences for actual
and proposed measures. Survey data will be collected, reduced,
analyzed, and reported bi-annually. This information will be made
available to the state legislature, state fisheries managers,
citizens advisory committees, federal fisheries managers,
interstate fisheries management commissions, and the public.
Additionally, the panel of anglers will receive, semi-annually, a
2-4 page synopsis of the results of each survey. </p>

<h1>Saltwater/Freshwater Fishing Participation</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Nick Nicholson, Project Leader</h2>

<p> <img src="/CRD/art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> To properly allocate Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration
funds between saltwater and freshwater anglers and to provide
data necessary to better manage Georgia's fishery resources, it
is essential to estmate numbers and determine the relative
percentages of resident Georgia saltwater and freshwater anglers
who fished within the state of Georgia during a specified period
of time. In the past, estimates of saltwater anglers were based
on an extremely small sample size; and the households that were
drawn by the U.S. Bureau of Census were not drawn based on the
population of anglers or angler households in the state, but
rather on some &quot;tiered&quot; sampling scheme which gives
metropolitan counties a high priority (i.e. all are selected),
and rural counties a low priority (few are selected). More
statistically valid estimates of participation are critical for
sound management decisions and proper fund allocations.</p>

<h1> Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission</h1>

<h2> Georgia Overview</h2>

<p>The Commission was formed by the fifteen Atlantic coast states
more than fifty years ago to assist in managing and conserving
their shared coastal fishery resources. With the recognition that
fish do not adhere to political boundaries, the states formed an
Interstate Compact, which was approved by the U.S Congress and
signed into law in 1942 by the President. The states have found
that their mutual interest in sustaining healthy coastal fishery
resources is best achieved by working cooperatively, in
collaboration with the federal government. Through this approach,
the states uphold their collective fisheries management
responsibilities in a cost effective, timely, and responsive
fashion.</p>

<p> States are represented on the Commission by three
Commissioners, including the Director for the state's marine
fisheries management agency, a state legislator, and an
individual representing fishery interests, appointed by the state
governor. The Commissioners for the State of Georgia are Ms.
Susan Shipman (Coastal Resources Division), Representative Hanson
Carter, and Mr. Ralph Balkom. These Commissioners participate in
deliberations in the Commission's five primary policy arenas:
interstate fisheries management; research and statistics; habitat
conservation; recreational fisheries; and law enforcement.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Interstate Fisheries Management</h2>

<p>Through the Interstate Fisheries Management Program,
Commissioners prepare fishery management plans to address the
conservation needs and socioeconomic concerns of Atlantic coast
fisheries. In January 1994, as a result of its success in the
management and conservation of Atlantic striped bass stocks, the
Commission became responsible for developing and implementing
fishery management programs for all Atlantic coast
interjurisdictional fisheries under the Atlantic Coastal
Fisheries Cooperative Management Act. Species regulated under
this program, which occur in Georgia waters include:<em> American
shad and river herring, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic sturgeon,
bluefish, menhaden, red drum, Spanish mackerel, spot, spotted
seatrout, and weakfish.</em></p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Research and Statistics</h2>

<p>Accurate and timely fisheries data are critical for effective
fisheries management. The Commission's Research and Statistics
Program works to ensure that the best scientific information
available is incorporated into the Commission's fishery
management plans. This program also works to coordinate state and
federal fisheries information programs so that the data collected
can be used on a coastwide basis.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Healthy Fish Habitat</h2>

<p>An important objective of the Commission is to conserve and
improve marine fish habitat. Healthy fish habitat is a vital
precursor to healthy fish stocks. To accomplish this, the
Commissions Habitat Program encompasses public education and
policy development.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Recreational Fisheries</h2>

<p>The Commission's Sport Fish Restoration Program is aimed at
improving fishery conservation and recreational fishing
opportunities for Atlantic coast marine species. Through this
program, the Commission provides liaison between state and
federal agencies and non-governmental organizations to promote
interstate and state/federal cooperation on marine recreational
fisheries programs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>The Commission's Law Enforcement Program assists the states in
coordinating their law enforcement efforts through data exchange
and problem identification. The program's primary objective is to
ensure that the law enforcement provisions of the Commission's
fishery management plans are adequate.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>FEDERAL AID IN SPORT FISH RESTORATION</h1>

<p> Did you know that each time you buy fishing equipment or fuel
for your boat, you are also helping to enhance sport fish
restoration? Many anglers do not realize that sporting goods
manufacturers pay a tax on items they produce. This tax is used
to purchase sites for boating access and improve boating and
fishing dock facilities. It is also used for research,
enhancement, and artificial reefs.</p>

<p> This User Pays, User Benefits funding approach began in 1937
with the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act. This Act
established excise taxes on outdoor sports equipment, with
proceeds going toward wildlife enhancement. In 1950, Congress
enacted the Sport Fish Restoration Act, sponsored by U.S. Rep.
John Dingell, Sr., of Michigan and Sen. Edwin Johnson, of
Colorado. The law, which became known as the
&quot;Dingell-Johnson Act&quot;, applies a 10 percent
manufacturer's excise tax on fishing rods, reels, creels, lures,
and flies. Tax revenues are transferred to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, which in turn distributes them to the states
for recreational sportfishing enhancement projects.</p>

<p> Each state's share is based 60 percent on its number of paid
licensed sport fishermen and 40 percent on its land and water
area. No state may receive more than 5 percent or less than 1
percent of each year's total collection.</p>

<p> In 1984, Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Rep. John Breaux
of Louisiana sponsored the Wallop-Breaux Amendment to the Sport
Fish Restoration Act, extending the tax to tackle boxes, sonar
fish finders, motorboat fuels, electric motors, and other
equipment not included in the earlier laws.</p>

<p> The Wallop-Breaux Amendment requires at least 12.5 percent of
all restoration money be spent on boating access to public waters
and requires Georgia and other coastal states to fund marine
recreational fisheries projects proportionate to the ratio of
freshwater to saltwater anglers. In addition, the amendment
requires that states continue to fund fisheries at their historic
levels and not substitute federal funds for those previously
supplied by the states.</p>

<p> In Georgia, Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration funds have
attributed to the construction of 14 offshore and 11 inshore
artificial reefs, 6 non-boating fishing docks, 4 boat ramps, and
2 floating dock facilities. Also, funds were used to conduct
numerous research and survey projects including life history
studies on important marine sport fish, sport fish monitoring,
exploitation and stock structure, recreational sport fish
landings, hooking mortality, and others. Basically, these
projects were financed by the boater and/or angler and were
designed for their benefit by providing better access and better
fisheries management.</p>

<h2>GEORGIA'S SPOTTED SEATROUT</h2>

<p> Spotted seatrout, a member of the Sciaenidae or drum family,
is the most targeted inshore sportfish species in Georgia. Known
as the drum family for their ability to make drumming sounds with
their air bladder, this group also includes red drum, black drum,
spot, weakfish and croaker. Spotted seatrout is identified as
having sharp canines, silvery body, with numerous distinct dark
spots on the upper side of its body, including the dorsal and
caudal fins. It occurs from Massachusetts to the Yucatan
peninsula.</p>

<p> Spotted seatrout reach sexual maturity at two years of age
with young fish spawning approximately 100,000 eggs while older
fish may spawn as many as 1,000,000. Spotted seatrout have a
protracted spring and summer spawning period which peaks in
Georgia during May. Spawning occurs primarily in the sounds along
the beaches. The eggs are buoyant and when hatched, the larval
fish are transported into the estuarine nursery areas by wind and
tidal currents.</p>

<p> Spotted seatrout are a schooling species and are
opportunistic carnivores whose feeding habits vary with size.
Juvenile trout feed initially on zooplankton, then primarily on
small crustaceans. Medium sized trout feed on shrimp and small
fish. Large fish (16+ inches) feed almost exclusively on other
fish (mullet, menhaden, etc.).</p>

<p> Tagging studies have shown that spotted seatrout are almost
estuarine specific and very few individuals exhibit movement
outside their natal estuary. Spotted seatrout prefer fringe areas
adjacent to banks, points, jetties and sand bars. In the spring
and summer, they can be located in their spawning areas near or
along beaches. As fall sets in and temperature drops, they move
into the lower sound where there is an abundance of prey. As
winter sets in they move further up the estuary into the upper
rivers and creeks, again, where there is a sufficient food
supply. With the onset of harsh weather, trout often move into
the deeper holes and channels where there is some protection from
the rapid temperature changes occurring in their usual fringe
habitat.</p>

<p> While large spotted seatrout are tolerant of extremes in
temperature and salinity, juvenile fish are susceptible to sudden
changes. Severe cold snaps and hurricanes can have a disastrous
effect, reducing the number of fish available to anglers the
following year(s). Regulations concerning the take of spotted
seatrout consist of a minimum size limit of 12 inches, and a
creel limit of 25 fish per person per day. This allows the
species to spawn at least once before harvest, thereby reducing
recovery time from severe climatic events. With a rapidly growing
coastal population, there is some concern over the stability of
our seatrout populations. It has been suggested to increase the
minimum size limit to 14 inches. This would allow the species to
spawn two or three times before reaching harvestable size,
ensuring a more stable population and rapid recovery from severe
climatic events. It would impact anglers the first year
implemented as there would be a one-year lag time for the year
class to reach harvestable size.</p>

<p> Recreational harvest of spotted seatrout in Georgia averages
over 475,000 fish per year. For the future of sportfish, we hope
all anglers will voluntarily comply with sportfishing
regulations. Conservation today will mean fishing opportunities
tomorrow.</p>

<h1>Georgia's Red Drum</h1>

<p>Contact: Spud Woodward </p>

<p> Phone:(912)264-7218</p>

<p> <img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), locally referred to as
channel or spottail bass, ranges from Laguna Madre, Mexico in the
Gulf of Mexico to Massachusetts in the Atlantic Ocean. Red drum
is one of 22 members of the family Sciaenidae found along the
Atlantic and Gulf coast of the United States. This group is
commonly known as the drum or croaker family since many of its
members, including red drum, produce drumming sounds by vibrating
their swim (air) bladders with special muscles. Adult red drum
are elongate, silvery red fish with a distinguishing black spot
at the base of the caudal (tail) fin above the lateral line.
However, young red drum may occasionally have numerous spots on
their sides.</p>

<p> Red drum are eurythermal, occurring over a temperature range
of 36-92oF, although they usually move into deeper water during
extremes. Small red drum less than 6-8 inches in length are more
susceptible to the effects of winter cold waves than larger
juveniles and adults. High red drum mortality during freezes
occurs with the ability to decimate large portions of juvenile
year classes.</p>

<p> Primarily found in estuarine and ocean waters, red drum are
somewhat catadromous meaning they may be found in freshwater but
must return to saltwater to spawn. After maturation, adult red
drum spend less time in the estuaries and more time in the ocean.
Red drum typically reach maturity at age four when approximately
32 inches in length and may live more than forty years.</p>

<p> Spawning normally occurs from July through October and takes
place primarily at major river inlets such as the Altamaha River.
Red drum are dioecious (i.e., distinct males and females) and
fertilization occurs externally. Red drummay spawn several times
throughout the spawning season. Spawning ocurs at night in
estuarine waters exhibiting optimum incubation salinities of
25-35 ppt below which the eggs would sink and above which the
eggs would clump together (Note: Salinity of freshwater is zero
and offshore ocean salinity is typically 35-36 parts per thousand
salt). In addition, optimum spawning occurs at temperatures of
72-86oF. Red drum eggs and larvae are carried through tidal and
current movement into estuarine systems. Increased spawning
activity is associated with new and full moon periods during the
spawning season.</p>

<p> Red drum larvae and young juveniles move into the mid and
upper portions of the estuary and generally remain in these areas
until Spring when approximately 8-10 months of age (6-10 inches
in length). In Spring, the young juveniles disperse throughout
the estuarine system and may be found occasionally in near
offshore waters. Juveniles and subadults typically remain in
estuarine waters for 3-5 years until reaching maturity (28-32
inches in length). </p>

<p> Red drum is a popular saltwater sportfish throughout the
southeastern United States and has been subject to increasing
pressure from a growing marine recreational fishery in Georgia.
Results from recreational fisheries surveys conducted by the
National Marine Fisheries Service and the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) indicate approximately two million red
drum have been caught by Georgia anglers in the past ten years.
During this same period, the number of saltwater fishing trips in
Georgia increased twofold. Research studies conducted by DNR
indicate that since the 1970's, Georgia's red drum population has
experienced a dramatic decrease in the number of young red drum
surviving to maturity. The bulk of the adult population consists
of red drum 15-25 years of age; very few adults less than 12
years of age exist. As these older adult red drum die off,
inadequate numbers of young adults exist to maintain the adult
population, possibly resulting in drastic declines in red drum
reproduction and numbers of young produced. </p>

<h3>Give Wildlife A Chance!</h3>
<p>It would be difficult to picture our state without songbirds or wildflowers to brighten our days, without wild 
places to revive our spirits, without eagles to show us how to slip the bonds of earth. Georgia&#146;s wildlife resources and their 
habitats enrich our lives daily.<br>
Nongame refers to all species of wildlife (both animals and plants) that are not legally harvested. In Georgia, there are 930 
species of wild animals, of which only 55 are game, and more than 3600 species of native wild plants. Combined, these 
species make up more than 98 percent of all wildlife in our state.<br>
Headquartered in Monroe County on the Rum Creek Wildlife Management Area, the Nongame-Endangered Wildlife 
Program conducts management projects benefiting nongame wildlife as well as programs educating the public about these 
species and their needs. Although a number of projects are directed at managing state- and federally-listed endangered 
species, a primary mission of the Program is to implement management practices which will ensure the survival of all species.<br>
The success of our efforts depends on you. Look with eyes that see the world around you! Note the colorful disguise of the 
butterfly, the magnificent flight of the falcon ... the graceful bow of the pitcher plant. Do a self-study of Georgia&#146;s wildlife. You 
can begin by getting to know more about the Nongame Program on the pages that follow!</p>

<h2><img src="http://www.dnr.state.ga.us/images/wrd.gif" align=left hspace=0 width=100 height=100>Georgia Natural Heritage Program Home Page</h2>
<p>Famous eighteenth and nineteenth century pioneer naturalists such as the Bartrams and the LeContes were 
among the first to describe the natural beauty of Georgia. These early explorers noted the diversity of habitats 
found here, and discovered plants and animals never before known such as the showy Franklinia tree, the 
hairy fever-tree (Pinckneya pubens), and LeConte's sparrow. Since then, amateur and professional naturalists alike have 
extolled the physical and biological diversity of this state.</p>
<p>Five distinct physiographic provinces are represented in Georgia-the Cumberland Plateau, the Ridge and Valley, the Blue 
Ridge, the Piedmont, and the Coastal Plain. These physiographic provinces differ with respect to geology, soils, and vegetation 
types; in addition, each province has associations of plants and animals unique to Georgia or the southeastern U.S. Examples 
of these natural habitats with high numbers of rare species include granite outcrops, cedar glades, pine savannas, pitcher plant 
bogs, and sandhills.</p>
<p>Full restoration of highly-disturbed ecosystems is impossible. Therefore, in order to conserve the natural diversity of our state, 
we must protect viable, representative examples of relatively undisturbed habitats and species assemblages. The recreational, 
aesthetic, and cultural values of our remaining wild areas, their usefulness for research and education, and their unknown 
resource potential will all be lost to future generations without careful protection efforts. The ultimate success of these 
protective endeavors depends upon an accurate assessment of natural diversity based on documented occurrences of plants, 
animals, and biological communities, as well as an understanding of the ecological processes that support this diversity. These 
are the goals of the Georgia Natural Heritage Program.</p>
<p>The Georgia Natural Heritage Program (GNHP) was established in 1986, through a cooperative agreement between the 
Georgia Department of Natural Resources and The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy, a private non-profit 
conservation organization has established programs similar to GNHP in all 50 states and within several other agencies and 
countries. The GNHP is now funded entirely by state and federal monies, and is a unit of the Wildlife Resources Division, of 
the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.</p>

<h3>A Balanced Information System</h3>
<p>Establishing Priorities<br>
The Georgia Natural Heritage Program focuses first on identifying &quot;elements&quot; of special concern in Georgia. These &quot;elements&quot; 
are plant species, animal species, or natural community types which are especially rare or threatened. Elements are given 
global and state ranks of rarity based on biological and geographical factors. Distributions of the highest-ranked, rarest 
elements are investigated first.<br>
Information from scientific literature, museum and herbarium collections, knowledgeable individuals, and scientific research 
organizations is utilized extensively to document occurrences of particular elements within the state. Field surveys are then 
conducted to verify these occurrences. The biological inventory thus represents a continuous, ongoing process whose product, 
a detailed atlas of Georgia's natural diversity, is constantly updated and revised.</p>
<h3>Cataloging Information</h3>
<p>The GNHP information system consists of a group of related, centralized databases. In order to maximize the accuracy, 
accessibility, and usefulness of the biological inventory information, it is maintained in three different forms.</p>
<p>1. Manual files - Reprints, field survey reports, location records and other pertinent documents are kept for each element.</p>
<p>2. Map files - Element occurrences and boundaries of managed areas are marked on detailed U.S. Geologic Survey 
topographic maps.</p>
<p>3. Computer files - Information from the manual and map files is coded and entered into a computerized database for rapid 
cross-referencing and retrieval of records. Much of this information has been incorporated into a geographic information 
system (GIS).</p>
<p>The GNHP has catalogued information on over 4,800 element occurrences of rare species or natural communities in the state. 
Over 150 federal, state, or private properties that provide some level of protection to these resources have been mapped and 
catalogued. GNHP is currently developing a GIS database of all state-owned lands managed by the Wildlife Resources 
Division. This effort includes field surveys for rare plant species of concern and natural communities on Division properties.</p>
<p>In 1992 the GNHP completed development of a digital landcover database for the entire state, derived from LANDSAT 
satellite imagery from the years 1988 through 1990. Fifteen landcover classes were developed including six classes of 
wetlands. Digital files and 1:24,000 scale maps have been distributed through the Georgia Department of Community Affairs 
to Regional Development Centers and local governments. A wall map depicting the landcover of Georgia and a summary of 
landcover statistics are available through the Georgia Geological Survey. Digital landcover data are available through the 
Georgia GIS Clearinghouse within the University System.</p>
<h3>Using the Information System</h3>
<p>The Georgia Natural Heritage Program makes possible a more objective identification and evaluation of important natural 
areas within the state. Inventory data can be used to locate areas in greatest need of protection, and to rank these lands for 
various protection methods, including fee simple acquisition. Protection may also be accomplished by easement, conservation 
agreement or land registry. Information from the GNHP databases has been used in Georgia's Preservation 2000 and River 
Care 2000 land acquisition programs. In addition, it has supported protection efforts for rare species and natural communities 
by other agencies and conservation organizations. Information derived from the GNHP is also useful in a number of related 
activities, including:</p>
<p>Environmental review - Planners can use GNHP data to help evaluate the environmental impacts of various routing and siting 
options for development projects.</p>
<p>Natural resources development - Developers can direct projects to the least sensitive lands, avoiding areas with rare or 
threatened elements.</p>
<p>Research and education - Scientists and educators can be made aware of unique research sites; as the GNHP databases 
grow, geographical ranges of species and community types within the state will be estimated with greater accuracy.</p>
<h3>How You Can Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>The Georgia Natural Heritage Program relies on information gathered from a variety of sources to develop and sustain its 
effectiveness. You may be able to help provide such information. Do you know the location of an exemplary or relatively 
undisturbed natural community? Do you have site information for a particular endangered species? If so, please contact the 
Georgia Natural Heritage Program. The information you provide will be verified and incorporated into the database as 
appropriate.</p>
<p>A knowledgeable and active citizenry is the key to protecting our environment. The people of Georgia are the guardians of 
their own natural heritage and everyone's support is needed to ensure that this outstanding natural diversity is preserved for 
future generations.</p>
<h3>Requesting Information for Sites</h3>
<p>All site specific information requests should be by letter with accompanying map(s). The letter should contain a brief 
description of the project, as well as an explanation of the information request.</p>
<p>The location of small to medium sites should be indicated on a photocopy of a USGS 7.5 minute (1:24,000 scale) quadrangle 
map. Larger sites should be indicated on photocopies of county road maps and state highway maps. Use a yellow highlighter 
to outline the location of the site. Do not forget to include the name of the map on the photocopy.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, you will be sent a list containing all tracked elements in our databases on or within 3 miles of the 
project site. The approximate distance and direction from the site will be included. We will also include lists useful for 
determining potential occurrences of elements in the vicinity of the site.</p>
<p>Please allow two or three weeks for processing of site information requests.</p>
<h3>Requesting the Location of Elements</h3>
<p>Location information of elements is available on diskette in dBase III format for DOS. Precision is to USGS 7.5 minute quad 
and also contains the county of occurrence. More precise locations of elements are available by special arrangement. The 
location of some elements is sensitive and not available at high precision.</p>
<h3>Protected Plant Book</h3>
<p>The Protected Plants of Georgia is a 246 page document available in hardcopy by written request to the Georgia Natural 
Heritage Program at no cost. The book is an information manual on plant species designated by the State of Georgia as 
endangered, threatened, rare, or unusual. Periodic updates are issued. It is designed for all levels of interest, including students, 
educators, amateur botanists, professional biologists, and environmental consultants. The text includes an overview of the 
Wildflower Preservation Act of 1973, and a copy of the official rules promulgated by authority of the Act. Suggestions for 
devising and using lists of potential occurrences, management considerations, and 103 species accounts that include legal 
status, synonymy, range, illustrations, descriptions, habitat, special identification features, management recommendations, 
remarks, and selected references are found. The book also contains occurrence lists for 159 counties and five physiographic 
provinces, cross-references, glossary, and special forms. Order by mail takes approximately 10 days for delivery.</p>

</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><br>
<font size="3">A new century looms before us. Already we begin
taking stock. What was the twentieth century<br>
about? What did we accomplish? What did it mean? How did we fail
and how did we triumph? <br>
Already we begin looking ahead. How will we shape the
twenty-first century? How will it shape<br>
us? Will it be more of the same, or will we make new and better
choices? We prepare to witness<br>
the end of an amazing era; yet we also anticipate the beginning
of something new. <br>
<br>
As we head toward 2000 and beyond, it is time to create a new
vision. A vision of community, of<br>
shared experiences and shared heritage. A vision of a sustainable
society rather than a throwaway<br>
one. A vision that blends what we treasure from our past
accomplishments and experiences with<br>
what we create from new ideas.<br>
<br>
Georgia ends the twentieth century as one of the fastest growing
and changing states in the union. <br>
We have grown so fast that we have not taken the opportunity to
stop and assess, to adjust our<br>
course, to decide if our choices have been best. Now is that
time. <br>
<br>
New plans are underway in Georgia for the future of our
communities, for new direction in state<br>
government, for new transportation systems, for the Atlanta
region to the year 2020, for coastal<br>
management, for economic development and for many other aspects
of Georgia. Planning for our<br>
future must include planning for the continuation and protection
of our heritage -- our historic<br>
places and cultural patterns that tell the story of who we have
been and who we are becoming.<br>
<br>
New Vision: The Preservation Plan for Georgia's Heritage is the
plan for the state historic<br>
preservation program administered by the Historic Preservation
Division of the Georgia<br>
Department of Natural Resources. It covers the final chapter of
the twentieth century, specifically<br>
the years 1996 through 2000. Yet it is more about the advent of
the new century than the end of<br>
the current one, for the future is now. The choices we make now
will limit the options and create<br>
the opportunities we will have when the new century arrives. <br>
<br>
This plan presents a new vision that is shared by many. It sets
goals that are designed to turn the<br>
vision into reality. It identifies actions that will help keep
open the options, remove the barriers,<br>
and create the opportunities that will allow Georgians to
preserve their historic places for a better<br>
future. The plan is intended to guide the direction and
activities of the Historic Preservation<br>
Division. Because it also represents the views and priorities of
preservationists throughout<br>
Georgia who participated in its development, New Vision: The
Preservation Plan for Georgia's<br>
Heritage can provide common direction for all organizations and
individuals who support the<br>
preservation of our historic places. <br>
<br>
How will Georgia grow and change in the new century? How will our
neighborhoods and our<br>
communities meet our needs and reflect our values? How will we
tell our story of who we are as<br>
Georgians? Historic preservation can provide some of the answers
to these vital questions. The<br>
Historic Preservation Division has adopted this plan as a
statement of policy direction and as a<br>
commitment to action for the protection and use of Georgia's
valuable historic resources. We<br>
invite the reader to join us in working together to turn the new
vision into reality for the<br>
betterment of Georgia. </font><font size="4"><br>

<em>Theme for 1997 Conference </em></p>
<p>The 1997 historic preservation conference, jointly sponsored
by the Historic Preservation Division and the Georgia Trust for
Historic Preservation will be held Sunday through Wednesday,
November 2 - 7, 1997, at the Classic Center in Athens. The state
conference will be held in conjunction with the southeastern
State Historic Preservation Offices annual meeting, which is
being held in Georgia for the first time since 1986. </p>
<p>The theme of the conference is A Celebration of Southern
Places. The keynote speaker will be Dr. Bill Ferris, director of
the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of
Mississippi in Oxford, and editor of The Southern Register, the
Center&#146;s quarterly newsletter, which celebrates the South
through a study of its history, culture, and arts.Dr.
Ferris&#146; keynote has been underwritten by the Athens-based
rock group R.E.M. Long-time supporters of preservation, R.E.M. is
the first sponsor of the 1997 conference. As in past years, HPD
and the Georgia Trust will be soliciting additional sponsorships
for <br>
underwriting conference expenses. </p>
<p>The goal of the 1997 conference will be to highlight the
unique qualities of southern heritage and resources, and to
celebrate the many people, places, and traditions that make up
the culture of the South. The conference program will also be a
vehicle for teaching, and will introduce ideas, concepts and
techniques in preservation practices that are on the cutting edge
of preservation activity. </p>
<p>If you are interested in a conference sponsorship, or if you
have program ideas, contact Carole Moore, conference coordinator,
at 404-651-5268. </p>

The Georgia Trust has given the HPD a &#147;Certificate of
Merit&#148; for the Resaca Preservation Plan, developed by the
Jaeger Company, with an HPD grant. As a part of the recent
American Battlefield Protection Program meeting in Chattanooga
participants visited the Resaca battlefield and were given an
overview of future plans. </p>
<p><font size="4">Environmental Review</font><br>
The HPD is planning a one-day training conference for DNR
employees on December 13 at the Forsyth Training Facility. The
purpose of this training session is to assist DNR associates in
interpreting Section 106 and GEPA regulations on state-owned
lands. </p>
<p><font size="4">Planning</font><br>
HPD staff is assisting the Georgia Downtown Development Authority
in two training workshops: the first was held in Athens on
September 28, and the second will be held on Jekyll Island on
October 16. Contact Bruce Green of the Office of Downtown
Development at 404-658-0472 if you are interested in their
training programs. </p>
<p><font size="4">National Register</font><br>
The HPD held the fall National Register Review Board Meeting in
Chattanooga on September 19 and presented 17 nominations. All
were accepted by the Review Board and will be finalized and sent
to the NPS for review and approval. </p>
<p><font size="4">Technical Assistance <br>
</font>The next technical presentation of the Architectural
Conservation Forum will be held at noon on October 24. The topic
of the Forum will be &#147;Historic Landscapes: Charleston
Gardens&#148; presented by Jim Cothran of Robert &amp; Company.
It will be held in the fifth floor conference room of the HPD
offices in the Healey Building. Contact Tracey Rutherford at HPD
for further information. </p>
<p>On November 20, HPD will offer a tax incentives workshop for
preservation consultants, regional planners, and Main Street
managers. The workshop will offer a comprehensive look at the tax
program format, National Register eligibility, and architectural
review questions. Call Mary Ann Eaddy for further information. </p>
<p><font size="4">Staff Notes<br>
</font>Ken Thomas has been appointed to the Board of the Center
for the Study of Georgia History. </p>
<p>Pratt Cassity and Lisa Vogel of the Office of Preservation
Services have co-authored an article for Historic Preservation
Forum, the 1996 summer issue. The article &#147;The Buck Stops .
. . Where?&#148; discusses use of local historic preservation
regulations in the Harry S. Truman Heritage District in
Independence, Missouri. Historic preservation guidelines for <br>
the district were first designated by the City Council in 1974. </p>
<p>Michael Miller recently participated in an affordable housing
workshop sponsored by the National Park Service. The workshop
brought together professionals from a number of state offices
which had successfully used the tax act program in promoting
affordable housing projects. Each discussed their state&#146;s
projects, and the way in which the Secretary <br>
of the Interior&#146;s Standards for Rehabilitation were
implemented in successful and unsuccessful projects. The NPS hope
to use this information in future Interpreting the Standards
Bulletins. </p>

<hr>
<p>After a year in Georgia as your State Historic Preservation Officer, I look back on these past months with both pride and 
gratitude. The Historic Preservation Division has accomplished a great deal in this time. These accomplishments are due to the 
efforts of an experienced, dedicated staff, and we all owe them our thanks. This staff represents individuals who care about 
the work they are doing and take pride in a job well done. I owe them my thanks as well, for all of the time and effort taken to 
advise and assist me as I traveled throughout this impressive state, learning about all the significant resources Georgia has to 
offer. Following are some of the noteworthy highlights of SFY 1995 (July 1, 1994 June 30, 1995): </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Move to the Healey Building</em> - The elevation of the office to Division level status and the subsequent 
move from cramped quarters to the historic setting of the National Register- listed Healey Building brought 
SFY 1995 to a glorious close. We are proud to have our workplace reflect our beliefs in the value of 
continuing to use our grand old buildings, and we will continue to take the opportunity to showcase the 
benefits of rehabilitation and reuse. After seven months in this location, we have begun to settle in, but the 
efforts of the staff space designers, the packers, the movers and the furniture buyers will not soon be 
forgotten. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Flood Assistance Effort - </em>The disaster of the great flood of the summer of 1994 presented HPD with 
many challenges. It was imperative that we provide effective service to our constituents impacted by the flood, 
and, in turn, the opportunity came about to introduce preservation to a broader public through financial and 
technical support. More than 100 rehabilitation projects are being accomplished with the federal funds 
allocated to this office for disaster relief. The benefits of this work expands far beyond any individual projects 
as a greater awareness of the long-term benefits of preservation changes the face of south Georgia 
communities. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Olympian Efforts</em> to maintain the record-breaking rate of review for Olympic-related Section 106 and 
federal and state tax projects have involved planning and technical services staff. Specific 106 projects this 
year in Atlanta have resulted in the creation of a major Memorandum of Agreement for Techwood Homes 
and a major Preservation Agreement for Summerhill that could change the way the City deals with the review 
process in the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Reduction of the National Register Backlog</em> - In spite of overwhelming workload increases and a significant 
loss of staff, the National Register unit has reduced the overall backlog of nominations by over 70%. This is a 
tremendous achievement. </p>
<p><em>Improvements in Section 106 Delivery</em> - I am especially proud of the execution of a Preservation 
Agreement with the South Georgia RDC, which will be the model for how the review process can work in the 
future. By involving regional and local agencies more directly in the review and decision-making process, 
critical decisions can be made more quickly and efficiently on a local level. Assisting CLGs This year we 
instituted a new grant system based on the &quot;building blocks plan&quot; to guide skill building for CLGs. This should 
help insure that CLG communities accomplish all the major steps in setting up their local programs and should 
help local decision-making. </p>
<p><em>Working with RDC Preservation Planners</em> - This year we instituted a new contracting system to specify 
mutually agreed upon work items. This insures that preservation planners' time can be focused on specific 
preservation activities, and it standardizes work required from all RDCs. </p>
<p><em>Doubled the Appropriation of the Heritage 2000 Grant Program </em>- This extremely well-received state 
grant program was initiated just two years ago to assist in funding the rehabilitation of historic buildings. The 
level of funding increased from $135,000 the first year to $270,000 the second year, and the number of 
projects almost doubled as well. A total of 32 projects have been funded in only two years; but requests for 
funding far exceed the amount of money available. </p>
<p><em>Educational Programming</em> - Expanded and Improved Frequent requests that we get from the public involve 
the need for more information on HPD programs. We are moving in that direction as quickly as we can with 
plans for a new quarterly newsletter, Preservation Georgia, a revised monthly F.Y.I., and an across the board 
increase in the number of workshops we offer both for the general public and for the preservation 
professional. </p>
<p><em>Archeology Summit</em> - Through recent attempts to identify major issues with professional and amateur 
archeologists, HPD is working to shift budget priorities in order to establish an Archeological Unit within the 
Division. This unit would integrate the functions of the State Archaeologist and current staff archaeologists into 
one office. </p>

<p>&#160;<font size="3"><strong>SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE GEORGIA
STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE </strong></font></p>
<hr>
<p>The Historic Preservation Division of the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources serves as the State Historic Preservation
Office in Georgia. Working in partnership with the U.S.
Department of the Interior and local communities, the Historic
Preservation Division carries out the mandates of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and works to
preserve the historical, architectural and archaeological
resources of Georgia. Through its Management and Information
Unit, Survey and National Register Unit, Technial Services Unit,
and Planning and Local Assistance Unit, the Historic Preservation
Division provides the following services in Georgia: </p>
<p>Identification and Evaluation of Significant Properties. The
Historic Preservation Division is charged with the responsibility
of funding and/or carrying out surveys to locate cultural
resources. Resources are identified through county-wide and
site-specific surveys or through local ctizens. The division is
also responsible for nominating eligible properties to the <a
href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/nr.html">National Register of
Historic Places</a>. By recognizing significant cultural
properties, the National Register program serves as a planning
tool to aid federal and state agencies, as well as local
governments and citizens. The identification of significant
properties encourages the development of projects which considers
the importance of these properties and allows for their continued
preservation and/or resue. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/pad/taxact.html">Federal and
State Tax Incentive Programs for Preservation</a>. The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 provides a 20% Investment Tax Credit for the
sensitive rehabilitation of income-producing historic properties,
and the Tax Treatment Extension Act of 1980 provides a tax
deduction for owners of both income-producing structures and
owner-occupied residence who have contributed a preservation
easement on their building to a qualified non-profit
organization. The Historic Preservation Division provides
professional opinion on a property's eligibility for these
programs, assists applicants by reviewing applications for tax
certification to determine whether work undertaken meets the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, and
forwards applications to the National Park Service with the State
Historic Preservation Officer's recommendations. The office also
administers a matching grant-in-aid program for survey and
planning projects with funding provided by the U.S. Department of
the Interior, and maintains information on other sources of
funding available for preservation projects. </p>
<p>Preservation Review and Community Planning Assistance. The
Historic Preservation Division is responsible for reviewing and
commenting on federally-funded, licensed and permitted projects
to insure that significant cultural resources are identified and
considered, and works with state agencies with similar reviews
required under the Georgia Environmental Policy Act (GEPA). The
Division also assists local communities with planning for the
protection of significant properties by providing information on
a variety of preservation planning tools, such as historic
district zoning, legislation, and preservation components of
community comprehensive plans. In addition, the office works with
many of the state's Regional Development Centers (RDCs) by
providing funding for preservation planning assistance through
the services of Regional Preservation Planners. </p>
<p>Technical Assistance and Information. Through the services of
a professional architectural staff, the Historic Preservation
Division offers assistance and direction for the development of
sound preservation projects and programs in Georgia. The Division
serves as an informational clearinghouse directing inquiries for
assistance to available resources and developing publications,
programs, and workshops to address topics of interest to
preservationists throughout the state. </p>
<p>Archaeological Services. The Office of the State Archaeologist
provides advice and assistance to the Historic Preservation
Division in carrying out the responsibilities of the Georgia
Antiquities Act which encourages the identification,
documentation, and protection of archaeological sites in Georgia,
especially those on sate-owned lands. Currently, services are
provided under contract with West Georgia College, located in
Carrollton, Georgia.</p>

A Vision for Historic Preservation in Georgia<br>
<br>
Georgia will be a better place tomorrow than it is today, providing quality communities in which<br>
to live, work, learn and recreate. Historic places will be widely valued as irreplaceable resources<br>
that contribute to our heritage, our economy, our neighborhoods, and our sense of who we are as<br>
Georgians. Communities and the State will plan for growth and change that respects and includes<br>
our historic places. Communities will possess the knowledge, the legal and financial tools, and<br>
the authority to decide how preservation and new development will relate to one another. There<br>
will still be distinctions between city and suburbs, developing areas and countryside. All<br>
Georgians will possess a greater understanding and appreciation of our shared heritage in all its<br>
variations. People and organizations throughout Georgia will work in partnership to preserve and<br>
use historic places. Georgia's communities, economy, environment and people will be better<br>
because of the preservation of historic resources.<br>
<br>
<em><strong><u>MISSION STATEMENT</u></strong></em><br>
<br>
The Historic Preservation Division's mission is to promote the preservation and use of historic<br>
places for a better Georgia.<br>
<br>
<em><strong><u>GOALS FOR PRESERVATION IN GEORGIA</u></strong></em><br>
<br>
1. Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia.<br>
<br>
2. Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information<br>
accessible for planning, advocacy and educational purposes.<br>
<br>
3. Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in<br>
Georgia.<br>
<br>
4. Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of historic preservation organizations<br>
throughout the state.<br>
<br>
5. Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future.<br>
<br>
These five goals represent the consensus of preservationists and other community and state<br>
leaders who helped create this plan. These goals will guide the Historic Preservation Division's<br>
actions, funding priorities, and policies through the year 2000. They are listed in order of priority<br>
and in the order in which preservation activity must take place--at the statewide level and at the<br>
local level--for historic places to truly be protected, preserved, used and appreciated. This plan is<br>
directed toward accomplishing the five goals, in order to make the Vision a reality in Georgia's<br>
future.<br>

<p><br>
Georgia was founded in 1733 as one of the thirteen original American colonies. For the next<br>
two-and-a-half centuries, its history was shaped largely by the activities and interactions of three<br>
peoples: Euro-Americans intent on creating a &quot;New World&quot; in America, African-Americans<br>
largely caught up in the creation of this new world, and American Indians who ultimately were<br>
dispossessed of it. For two centuries prior to English colonization, the Spanish with their African<br>
servants and slaves explored and settled what would later become Georgia. This<br>
African-European presence was itself preceded by thousands of years of American Indian<br>
occupation. <br>
<br>
The 10,000-year history of what we now know as Georgia has left its mark all across the state. <br>
Not only in metropolitan areas, where the signs of development are everywhere, but also in the<br>
most remote mountain valleys, along apparently undeveloped rivers and streams, across vast<br>
stretches of field and forest, deep in seemingly inaccessible swamps, and along coastal marshes<br>
and islands--there is hardly an acre of land in Georgia untouched by the past. <br>
<br>
The evidence of history takes the form of buildings and structures, historic and archeological sites,<br>
historic landscapes and traditional cultural properties, and historic districts. These are Georgia's<br>
historic properties. They provide a window into our past, and a foundation on which to build a<br>
vision for our future. Preserving these historic properties is what historic preservation is all<br>
about.<br>
<br>
An Overview of Georgia's Historic Properties<br>
<br>
Buildings<br>
<br>
For many people, buildings are the most familiar type of historic property in Georgia. Certainly<br>
the most obvious, they dominate Georgia's listings in the National Register of Historic Places. <br>
Usually categorized by function, Georgia's historic buildings include a wide variety of houses,<br>
stores and offices, factories and mills, outbuildings on farms and plantations, and community<br>
landmarks.<br>
<br>
Houses are the most prevalent type of historic building in Georgia. They make up approximately<br>
70% of all the Georgia listings in the National Register and nearly 80% of all surveyed properties. <br>
Most historic houses in Georgia are one-story high with wood frames and siding. Others are built<br>
of brick; a few are constructed of stone. The single-family detached house is the most common<br>
house form in the state, although apartment buildings are found in most larger communities and<br>
rowhouses highlight Savannah. <br>
<br>
Approximately one-third of Georgia's historic housing is located in the state's cities and larger<br>
towns; another third is found in smaller towns; and the remaining third is dispersed throughout the<br>
countryside. Three-quarters of all the extant historic houses in Georgia were built between 1890<br>
and World War II. As important as individual buildings, houses with their landscaped yards and<br>
associated domestic archeological resources form a special category of historic property known as<br>
&quot;Georgia's Living Places.&quot; In rural areas, historic houses serve as the centerpieces of farms and<br>
plantations; in communities, houses grouped together form historic neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
Commercial buildings including stores and offices constitute only about 5% of Georgia's historic<br>
buildings, but they are the second most numerous type of historic building in Georgia. <br>
Commercial buildings tend to be concentrated in communities, often forming a cohesive business<br>
district or &quot;downtown,&quot; although some like the country store are found in sparsely settled rural<br>
areas and others like the corner store are situated in residential neighborhoods. In addition to the<br>
country and corner stores, common Georgia examples include the small-town &quot;storefront&quot;<br>
building, the larger city business block, and the urban skyscraper. <br>
<br>
Brick is a common building material, although wood is used in some rural and small-town<br>
commercial buildings; big-city buildings employ steel and concrete. Most extant historic<br>
commercial buildings in Georgia date from the late 19th through the early 20th centuries.<br>
<br>
Industrial buildings in Georgia are not numerous, constituting only about 1% of all surveyed<br>
buildings, yet they represent some of the largest and most economically important historic<br>
buildings in the state. Georgia's industrial buildings include factories, mills, warehouses, gins, and<br>
multi-purpose lofts. They usually are located in or adjacent to communities, often along rivers or<br>
railroads, sometimes grouped in industrial areas or districts. <br>
<br>
A distinct form of self-contained community, the mill village, grew up around some industrial<br>
buildings, usually late 19th or early 20th century textile mills. In contrast, rural grist mills with<br>
their characteristic dams and millponds are located near sources of waterpower, often in isolated<br>
areas. Most rural mills are constructed of wood with heavy mortised-and-tenoned wood frames,<br>
although a few are built of brick or stone. <br>
<br>
Most of the larger urban factories are constructed of brick with &quot;slow burning&quot; heavy timber<br>
frames. Twentieth-century industrial buildings often were constructed with steel or concrete<br>
frames and concrete and brick walls, for durability and to make them relatively fireproof.<br>
<br>
Agricultural buildings are representative of the major role played by agriculture throughout<br>
Georgia's history. Historically, agriculture dominated land use across the state. Agricultural<br>
buildings are found in most rural areas, usually in complexes, along with other structures and<br>
landscape features comprising farmsteads or plantations. The typical historic Georgia farm<br>
consists of a late 19th or early 20th century farmhouse, half a dozen outbuildings, a yard, and<br>
agricultural land. <br>
Approximately 10% of all surveyed houses in the state are associated with farms. Associated<br>
historic agricultural buildings typically include tenant farmhouses, barns, cotton gins, mills, and<br>
offices, although the complete list of Georgia's agricultural outbuildings is seemingly endless.<br>
<br>
Community landmark buildings are a small but diverse group of historic buildings housing<br>
community institutions such as local governments, religious groups, civic organizations, hospitals,<br>
and schools. Although they account for only about 5% of all surveyed buildings, community<br>
landmarks are prominent due to their large size, architectural treatment, and strategic location. <br>
They are focal points, literally and figuratively, for their communities. Common examples include<br>
courthouses, city halls, post offices, churches, lodges and clubhouses, libraries, jails, depots,<br>
theaters, and community centers.<br>
<br>
Structures<br>
<br>
Structures are defined as &quot;functional constructions made usually for purposes other than creating<br>
shelter.&quot; In other words, structures are not primarily places in which to live or work, although<br>
they may be occupied for short periods of time or used in work or other activities. Many<br>
structures resemble buildings and are differentiated from them only by function; other kinds of<br>
structures are fundamentally different than buildings. Many structures are physically or<br>
functionally related to buildings and are sometimes considered subsidiary to them; some are found<br>
in complexes while others stand alone.<br>
<br>
Common kinds of historic structures in Georgia include wells, water towers, agricultural<br>
outbuildings such as corn cribs or implement sheds, military fortifications, bridges, and railroads<br>
(rail beds). Other familiar although less numerous structures include lighthouses, tunnels, dams,<br>
and locomotives. Less familiar types of structures include mines and quarries.<br>
<br>
Structured Environments<br>
<br>
Another kind of historic structure, less commonly recognized, is what might be called a structured<br>
environment: the large-scale, two-dimensional plans or patterns that underlie and shape historic<br>
development. Historic structured environments are found all across Georgia, in cities, towns, and<br>
rural areas. They include city plans, courthouse squares, the layout of parks, gardens, cemeteries,<br>
and yards, agricultural field patterns, and land-lot lines.<br>
<br>
Sites<br>
<br>
A site is defined as &quot;the location of a significant event ... occupation, or activity, or a building or<br>
structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic,<br>
cultural, or archeological value ....&quot; There are several distinct types of sites in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Archeological sites, both historic and prehistoric, are the most numerous if not the most familiar<br>
type of historic property in Georgia. More than 25,000 archeological sites are recorded in the<br>
Georgia Archeological Site File. Approximately 2,000 newly discovered sites are added each<br>
year, yet only a small fraction of the state has been surveyed methodically for archeological<br>
resources.<br>
<br>
A wide variety of archeological sites exists in Georgia. Some sites are complex &quot;stratified&quot; sites,<br>
with various layers representing different periods of occupation and use. Other complex sites are<br>
&quot;multi-component&quot; locations of prehistoric villages. Less complex sites may represent a single<br>
activity or use, such as hunting or fishing, manufacturing or quarrying, or camping. Archeological<br>
sites in Georgia usually contain artifacts made from stone, bone, ceramic, metal, wood, paper, and<br>
glass, even fabric, food remains, and plant matter. Major river valleys, ridge lines, and the Fall<br>
Line have yielded the greatest numbers of archeological sites. A less well-known type of<br>
archeological site, the underwater site, is found on river bottoms, in coastal marshes, and off the<br>
coast on the continental shelf. <br>
<br>
Prehistoric Indians built monumental architecture, in the form of earthen and stone mounds<br>
scattered over the Georgia landscape, since the beginning of the Christian era. They were most<br>
pronounced in the period 1250-1500 A.D. Many still stand.<br>
<br>
Prehistoric archeological sites in Georgia include earthen mounds and platforms, shell middens in<br>
the form of piles and rings, rock quarries, fishing weirs, rock piles, scattered stone chips, and<br>
concentrations of broken pottery. Examples of historic archeological sites include Revolutionary<br>
and Civil War trenches and earthworks, industrial sites, subsurface evidence of former landscape<br>
features, buildings, and structures such as the former Cherokee Nation capitol at New Echota,<br>
and refuse dumps. Underwater archeological sites include submerged ships, piers and wharfs,<br>
building foundations, trash dumps, river crossings, and evidence of former waterfront activities. <br>
Graves also can be considered as archeological sites, although state and federal laws protecting<br>
burial sites severely restrict their archeological investigation.<br>
<br>
Historic sites are places where a significant event or activity took place but where there were no<br>
buildings or structures associated with the event or activity or where the associated buildings or<br>
structures no longer exist. Historic sites are important primarily for the events or activities which<br>
took place there, although significant archeological resources also may be present at the site. <br>
<br>
Historic sites may be characterized by distinctive natural features, like a mountain or cave or tree,<br>
or they may simply be the place where something important happened, like an open field. Good<br>
examples of historic sites in Georgia are the Jeff Davis Capture Site in Irwin County and the<br>
Bloody Marsh battle site in Glynn County. Historic sites are often marked by historic markers or<br>
plaques.<br>
<br>
Traditional cultural properties are a newly recognized type of historic site. This type may be a<br>
distinctive natural place (such as a mountaintop) or historic environment (such as an ethnic<br>
neighborhood), or it may be simply a spatial location, a place, having pronounced historic cultural<br>
value to a living racial, ethnic, or cultural group today. Historical associations with such<br>
properties may be demonstrated through historical documentation, but more likely through<br>
traditional uses or practices, oral history, or common cultural knowledge. Because traditional<br>
cultural properties may be significant for metaphysical reasons, they may be especially difficult to<br>
detect by &quot;outsiders.&quot; Although no traditional cultural properties have been officially recognized<br>
in Georgia, several have been tentatively identified.<br>
<br>
Landscapes<br>
<br>
Landscapes are a special type of historic property combining elements of &quot;sites&quot; and &quot;structures&quot;<br>
and often including buildings as well. Most historic landscapes also contain archeological<br>
resources. Historic landscapes often are overlooked, taken for granted, or misunderstood as<br>
&quot;natural&quot; resources.<br>
<br>
Georgia contains a variety of historic landscapes. They range from small formal gardens to vast<br>
expanses of agricultural countryside and planted woodlands. Typical examples are courthouse<br>
squares (often the largest public landscape space in a community), city parks, streetscapes in<br>
neighborhoods with their street trees and sidewalks, and cemeteries. A well-documented type of<br>
historic landscape in Georgia is the yard; nine major forms of historic domestic landscaping have<br>
been identified through the Georgia's Living Places project.<br>
<br>
Historic Districts<br>
<br>
Historic districts are another special type of historic resource. Defined as &quot;a significant<br>
concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united historically or<br>
aesthetically by plan or physical development,&quot; a historic district contains a combination of the<br>
other types of historic properties--buildings, structures, sites, landscapes, structured<br>
environments--where the overall grouping, the ensemble, takes on an identity and significance<br>
greater than the individual components. <br>
<br>
Historic districts make up about 25% of Georgia's National Register listings, yet they include<br>
more than 95% of all the historic properties listed in the National Register. Because they contain<br>
such a variety of historic properties, in their historic spatial relationships, historic districts best<br>
represent what our historic environments really were like.<br>
<br>
The most common type of historic district in Georgia is the residential neighborhood. Second in<br>
frequency is the downtown central business district. Other important but less numerous types of<br>
historic districts include industrial and warehousing areas, school campuses, military installations,<br>
parks, and waterfronts. Georgia has several extensive archeological districts containing<br>
historically and geographically related sites, such as the Etowah Valley district, and several vast<br>
rural historic districts containing multiple farms, rural communities, and historic rural landscapes,<br>
such as McLemore Cove and the Sautee-Nacoochee Valleys.<br>
<br>
How Many Are There?<br>
<br>
It is estimated that there are about 71,500 historic buildings in Georgia at the present time. Field<br>
survey information on over 26,000 buildings has been entered into the Historic Preservation<br>
Division's computerized database. Previously unsurveyed buildings are being added to the<br>
inventory at the rate of about 5,000 per year.<br>
<br>
Nobody knows exactly how many archeological sites exist in Georgia; because they are mostly<br>
underground (or under water), they are difficult to locate without expert field investigation. At<br>
the present time, more than 25,000 archeological sites have been identified and recorded in the<br>
University of Georgia's Archeological Site File, yet only a small percentage of the state's land area<br>
has been systematically searched for archeological sites. Newly discovered archeological sites are<br>
being reported at the rate of nearly 2,000 per year.<br>
<br>
Why do these numbers keep changing?<br>
<br>
The number of known and estimated historic properties in Georgia changes frequently, with good<br>
reason. On the one hand, known historic properties are lost due to demolition, remodeling, or<br>
destruction every year. A historic building may burn to the ground, or an archeological site may<br>
be bulldozed for a new shopping center. On the other hand, with the passage of time, properties<br>
that formerly were not old enough to be considered historic come of age, so to speak, and the<br>
expanding scope of history and archeology encompass properties not previously recognized as<br>
historic. In addition, continuing and improved field surveys identify more historic properties<br>
every year, and provide a better basis for estimating the total number of historic properties in the<br>
state. So, while the number of historic properties in Georgia at any given point in time is finite, it<br>
will change over time.<br>
<br>
Why are more historic properties being identified?<br>
<br>
The process of identifying and evaluating historic properties lies at the very heart of historic<br>
preservation. By its very nature, it is a continuing, neverending process. Just as time marches on,<br>
so does history, and historic preservation with it. <br>
<br>
The study of history and the practice of archeology, both of which underlie historic preservation,<br>
are dynamic. Both are constantly expanding. For example, historians are now studying what is<br>
called the &quot;recent past&quot;--the period from World War II through the 1960s--while archeologists are<br>
pushing back the dates of human occupation in Georgia to 10,000 years and more. Historians<br>
continue to expand on the achievements of Georgia's African-Americans with special interest in<br>
the 1960s Civil Rights movement, while archeologists and ethnologists are beginning to document<br>
American Indian traditional cultural properties overlooked in previous surveys. If we were to try<br>
to limit our universe of historic properties to only those previously recognized by historians and<br>
archeologists, we would be undermining the very basis of the historic preservation movement.<br>
<br>
Continuing and improving field surveys are identifying more historic properties than ever before<br>
all across the state. For example, a recently completed county survey identified 20 times the<br>
number of historic properties recorded in a 1970s survey of the county. By restricting the number<br>
of historic properties to those previously surveyed, we would be denying the obvious fact that<br>
many more historic properties exist.<br>
<br>
An expanding historic preservation constituency is bringing with it a broader view of historic<br>
properties. For example, increased participation by African-Americans has encouraged the<br>
broader recognition of African-American historic properties from the earliest days of exploration<br>
and settlement to the mid-20th-century Civil Rights movement. Interest on the part of American<br>
Indian groups has led to a heightened sensitivity to many types of prehistoric sites, particularly<br>
burials and traditional cultural properties. The important role played by women in historic<br>
preservation has resulted in new interest in women's history and associated historic properties. If<br>
we were to limit historic properties to those that we know now, many new interest groups would<br>
find their heritage excluded from the historic preservation movement. As more cultural and<br>
interest groups discover their heritage, their desire to preserve the historic places associated with<br>
that heritage grows.<br>
<br>
In short: to limit our universe of historic properties to what is currently known would artificially<br>
constrain historic preservation and directly controvert the intent of the National Historic<br>
Preservation Act which is to preserve properties which represent the &quot;broad patterns&quot; of<br>
American history as we best understand it.<br>
<br>
How many historic properties have been lost?<br>
<br>
No one knows how many archeological sites have been destroyed over the years. But every time<br>
ground-disturbing activity takes place, there is the potential for additional loss.<br>
<br>
It is clear, however, that the vast majority of all the historic buildings and structures that ever<br>
existed in Georgia already have been lost. In just the last 50 years, nearly three-quarters of the<br>
buildings and structures that existed prior to World War II have been lost through destruction or<br>
remodeling. And in some counties, more than one-quarter of the surveyed historic properties that<br>
existed twenty years ago are now gone.<br>
<br>
What kinds of buildings have been lost? Whose heritage has vanished? No detailed study has<br>
been done, but it appears that the greatest losses have been vernacular buildings, modest houses,<br>
tenant farm houses which once dotted every 40 acres or so, many utilitarian structures like mule<br>
barns, liveries, and warehouses, and many homes associated with African-Americans in cities,<br>
towns, and rural areas. Yet virtually every community has lost its share of local landmark<br>
buildings as well--stylish houses, sometimes whole streets of them, grand old hotels, business<br>
blocks, railroad depots, even courthouses.<br>
<br>
What Makes All These Properties &quot;Historic?&quot;<br>
<br>
To be considered &quot;historic,&quot; a property must have three essential attributes: sufficient age, a<br>
relatively high degree of integrity, and significance in history.<br>
<br>
Age<br>
<br>
A historic property must be old enough to be considered &quot;historic.&quot; Historic properties are, by<br>
definition, old, not new. Generally speaking, this means that a property must be at least 50 years<br>
old, although this is just a general rule, not an absolute requirement. Another way of looking at it<br>
is that a property must be old enough to be understood for the role it played in the community,<br>
state or nation so that its place in history is clear.<br>
<br>
Integrity<br>
<br>
In addition to having sufficient age, a property must also have retained what is called its<br>
&quot;integrity&quot; to be considered historic. For a building, structure, landscape feature, historic site, or<br>
historic district, this means that the property must be relatively unchanged. Its essential<br>
character-defining features must still be present. For an archeological site, integrity means that<br>
the site must be relatively undisturbed, with its patterns and layers of artifacts and other<br>
archeological evidence relatively intact. For a traditional cultural property, integrity means that<br>
the site must be recognizable to today's affiliated cultural group, documentable through tradition,<br>
and still used or revered in some way.<br>
<br>
Significance<br>
<br>
Finally, a property must be significant to be considered historic. Significance is generally defined<br>
in three ways: through direct association with individuals, events, activities, or developments that<br>
were important in the past--that shaped our history, or that reflect important aspects of our<br>
history; by embodying the distinctive physical and spatial characteristics of an architectural style<br>
or type of building, structure, landscape, or planned environment, or a method of construction, or<br>
by embodying high artistic values or fine craftsmanship; or by having the potential to yield<br>
information important to our understanding of the past through archeological, architectural, or<br>
other physical investigation and analysis.<br>
<br>
Who Decides What is Historic?<br>
<br>
Each of us may have our own personal opinions about what is historic and what is not. Similarly,<br>
different social and cultural groups of people may have different definitions of &quot;historic.&quot; Other<br>
interest groups in our society may look at historic properties in entirely different ways, or may not<br>
value them at all. An important part of historic preservation is the establishment of public<br>
processes through which consensus can be reached as to what is historic and what is not. Once<br>
this consensus has been reached, it becomes public preservation policy. There are several<br>
established ways in Georgia of publicly determining whether properties are historic and worthy of<br>
being preserved.<br>
<br>
National Register of Historic Places<br>
<br>
One of the most important ways in which we determine which of our properties are historic and<br>
which are not is the National Register of Historic Places. Ever since its creation by Congress<br>
through the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Register has been one of the<br>
foundations of historic preservation in Georgia and across the country. It provides uniform<br>
standards, a public process, and a national perspective for determining the significance and<br>
preservation worthiness of properties. Although the criteria for determining National Register<br>
eligibility are essentially unchanged since 1966, their interpretation and application to properties<br>
are continuously clarified and updated through published guidance and bulletins. Listing in the<br>
National Register, or determining National Register eligibility, is one of the clearest statements of<br>
public policy about what is historic and worthy of being preserved.<br>
<br>
At the present time there are more than 1,600 official Georgia listings in the National Register<br>
representing more than 38,000 historic properties in the state. Historic properties in Georgia are<br>
being added to the National Register at the rate of approximately 45 listings representing some<br>
1,750 historic properties per year. Georgia ranks about 10th in the nation in the number of<br>
National Register-listed properties.<br>
<br>
Georgia Register of Historic Places<br>
<br>
Established in 1989, the Georgia Register of Historic Places is our state's companion to the<br>
National Register of Historic Places. Modeled closely after the National Register, the Georgia<br>
Register is Georgia's official statewide list of historic properties worthy of being preserved. <br>
Properties listed in the National Register are automatically listed in the Georgia Register.<br>
<br>
Local Designations<br>
<br>
Another important way of determining the significance and preservation worthiness of properties<br>
in Georgia is through local landmark or historic district designation. Under the provisions of the<br>
Georgia Historic Preservation Act of 1980, local governments can pass historic preservation<br>
ordinances which specify procedures for designating historic properties in their jurisdictions. <br>
Local designation provides some level of protection for those properties. Designations may vary<br>
from community to community, reflecting local conditions, needs, goals, and prerogatives. At the<br>
present time, approximately 80 local governments in Georgia have enacted historic preservation<br>
ordinances and appointed preservation commissions.<br>
<br>
Planning<br>
<br>
Yet another way that local communities can define their historic properties is through local<br>
comprehensive plans. As required by the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, local comprehensive<br>
plans must include consideration of historic properties. While this consideration can vary widely<br>
from community to community, and while these plans do not have the force of local designations<br>
under a preservation ordinance, local comprehensive plans can provide an opportunity for<br>
communities to express an opinion about what is locally considered historic and worthy of being<br>
preserved. Other land use planning tools, including zoning ordinances, sign and tree ordinances,<br>
and others can be used to delineate and designate historic places. <br>
<br>
Historical Markers<br>
<br>
The state historical marker program, administered by the Department of Natural Resources, uses<br>
unique criteria and procedures to identify properties of statewide significance. The oldest of the<br>
many ways in which historic properties are identified in Georgia, the marker program dates back<br>
to the early 1950s. Through the marker program, former as well as extant historic properties are<br>
officially recognized. Currently there are nearly 2,000 state historical markers in Georgia. They<br>
are accompanied by uncounted numbers of local and regional historical markers.<br>
<br>
Exactly How Are Properties Determined to be Historic?<br>
<br>
Although there are several different ways of determining whether properties are historic, all of<br>
these processes share certain essential steps. These common steps constitute a fundamental<br>
historic preservation routine, or methodology. <br>
<br>
The first step consists of gathering information about a specific property --the facts, so to<br>
speak--including a physical description and historical documentation. <br>
<br>
The second step involves putting the individual property in its place in history, seeing how it &quot;fits&quot;<br>
into the larger scheme of things, historically speaking. Useful ways of doing this include<br>
comparing and contrasting it to similar properties, to historically related properties, or to other<br>
properties in the same vicinity (see Appendix B for more information). Another useful way is to<br>
determine how the property relates to the &quot;distinctive aspects&quot; of Georgia's history (see sidebar).<br>
<br>
The third step consists of applying criteria for evaluation to the property and what is known about<br>
it--a yardstick for measuring its significance--such as the National Register of Historic Places<br>
&quot;Criteria for Evaluation&quot; or the designation standards found in a local historic preservation<br>
ordinance. Each step of the process involves public input and participation along with appropriate<br>
professional involvement. Taken together, these three steps constitute the basic methodology for<br>
determining the significance of properties.<br>
<br>
Why Preserve Historic Properties?<br>
<br>
Above and beyond their historical significance, why are Georgia's historic properties valuable<br>
resources? Why should they be preserved? The answers are many, and varied.<br>
<br>
Historic properties are tangible evidence of our history. They bring history to life in ways that no<br>
written or even audio-visual materials can do. In doing so, they help us better understand who we<br>
are today, as individuals and as a people, and how things got to be the way they are.<br>
<br>
Historic properties also contribute to a sense of place. They make one place different from<br>
another and make each community unique. They reinforce the lessons of history while<br>
strengthening our identity. They provide a framework for new development; they add variety to<br>
our everyday surroundings.<br>
<br>
Historic properties also represent an enormous investment of time, money, energy, and<br>
materials--resources which, like all other nonrenewable resources, should be used wisely and<br>
conserved. Additionally, historic properties can continue in productive service in everyday life,<br>
either for the use for which they were originally intended, or adapted to new or upgraded uses.<br>
<br>
Historic properties enrich the quality of our lives by presenting for our benefit a variety of<br>
architectural styles, construction materials, and craftsmanship which appears nowhere else in our<br>
physical environment.<br>
<br>
And historic properties literally embody knowledge--about ourselves and our past, as well as<br>
themselves--which can be recovered for the benefit of all through careful archeological or<br>
architectural investigation and conservation.<br>

</p>
<hr>
<p><br>
As we approach the end of the twentieth century, historic preservation continues to become a<br>
more integral part of the social, economic, and political landscape in the nation as well as in<br>
Georgia. The preservation of historic properties has become one of many quality of life issues<br>
facing our state. Historic resources are affected by many kinds of development, societal and<br>
financial trends. In planning for preservation, it is essential to examine the major trends occurring<br>
in the state and in communities and how those trends affect Georgia's historic resources. <br>
Many Georgians are concerned about the proliferation of unplanned growth that is resulting in<br>
urban sprawl and unsightly development. They look to historic preservation as one method to<br>
help maintain viable communities and improve the quality of life.<br>
<br>
It is important to understand changes that are affecting the state as a whole so that preservation<br>
programs in Georgia can be designed to respond in the most effective manner. In this way,<br>
historic places will more likely help shape Georgia's future.<br>
<br>
Fast-Changing Population <br>
<br>
Statewide Trends<br>
<br>
Population change is transforming Georgia. The major population trends facing Georgia are the<br>
rapid growth taking place in the suburban areas of the state, especially within 100 miles of<br>
Atlanta, and the continued decrease within large cities and rural areas. These diverse directions<br>
in population affect economic activity, existing and planned infrastructure, governmental policies,<br>
and land use decisions, which in turn affect historic resources.<br>
<br>
Georgia is currently the tenth most populated--and one of the fastest growing--states in the<br>
nation, estimated in 1995 to have a population of almost 7.2 million. The 1980s was the first<br>
decade in history that Georgia experienced more population increase from net migration than<br>
from natural increase. Throughout the 1990s and into the new century, Georgia will continue to<br>
grow.<br>
<br>
The age makeup of Georgia is also changing. For the first time, Georgia is in the top ten<br>
nationally in states attracting new elderly residents. Between 1985 and 1990, 44,475 people<br>
sixty-five and older moved into Georgia and more retirees decided to leave Florida for Georgia<br>
than those who went the other way. Notwithstanding the growing elderly population, Georgia's<br>
population is young, with a median age of 31.8 years. The high population of young people can<br>
be directly attributed to the favorable job market created by Georgia's expanding economy. <br>
<br>
Georgia ranks fifth in African-American population nationally, with 1.8 million persons<br>
comprising 27% of the state's population. <br>
<br>
Between 1980 and 1990, 43 Georgia counties lost population, 77 grew at less than the state<br>
average, and 40 grew faster than the state average. By combining these population trends with<br>
urban and rural characteristics, the state can be subdivided into four major population areas. Four<br>
distinct &quot;Georgias&quot; emerge from this classification: suburban, urban, growing rural and declining<br>
rural counties.<br>
<br>
Suburban Georgia<br>
<br>
Riding the crest of population growth is the metropolitan Atlanta area, especially the suburban<br>
and exurban portions within 100 miles of the central city. More than 66% of the total population<br>
of Georgia lives in the Atlanta region. Georgia has three of the top ten fastest growing counties<br>
in the United States. Two of these, Henry and Paulding counties, lie within the metro Atlanta<br>
area. The population of the 14-county metro Atlanta region grew nearly 70% from 1970 to 1990,<br>
exceeding the state growth rate by 25%. During the same time period, Cobb and Gwinnett<br>
counties each increased by more than 250,000 residents, while Fayette County added 50,000 new<br>
residents, growing at an astonishing rate of 550%. Eight of the counties in the region grew at<br>
rates in excess of 200%.<br>
<br>
Urban Georgia<br>
<br>
The population of Georgia's cities as a percentage of the total state population is steadily<br>
decreasing. In 1960, 54% of the state's citizens lived in cities. In 1992, only 39% lived within<br>
city boundaries. Many Georgia cities are becoming a workplace for the middle class, but a home <br>
predominantly to the very wealthy or to minorities and the poor. Growth in the suburbs often<br>
comes at the expense of urbanized areas. Every major Georgia central city is experiencing a<br>
middle-class population decline. <br>
<br>
Rural Areas of Growth<br>
<br>
The rural growth areas of Georgia tend to be located in the northern portion of the state or along<br>
the coast. These counties either possess scenic beauty, and thus attract tourists and retirees, are<br>
located near a military base, or are regional economic centers.<br>
<br>
Rural Areas of Decline<br>
<br>
Rural areas declining in population face the most uncertain future. These areas, concentrated in<br>
the southern half of the state, are characterized by long-term population loss, lack of employment<br>
opportunities and continued high levels of outmigration of working age people, leaving behind a<br>
large number of young and older residents. <br>
<br>
Effects of Population Trends<br>
<br>
The effects of changing population on the historic resources of Georgia vary depending upon the<br>
area of the state. Areas of suburban growth create different concerns and opportunities for<br>
historic property than do areas of rural or urban decline.<br>
<br>
The rapid growth being experienced on the suburban fringe of metropolitan areas creates<br>
widespread change in the landscape and pressure on existing infrastructure and historic resources. <br>
Similar pressures exist in the rural growth areas of the north Georgia mountains and along the<br>
Atlantic coast. In areas of strip developments, residential subdivisions and suburban sprawl,<br>
infrastructure must expand to satisfy a growing population's need for clean water, sewers, roads,<br>
and utilities. These changes often come at the expense of open space, historic landscapes, historic<br>
buildings and archeological sites. <br>
<br>
Anticipating and reacting to rapid growth requires time, effort and planning. Only one-third of<br>
Georgia's 159 counties have enacted any kind of zoning ordinance, although this is slowly<br>
changing. The potential for uncontrolled sprawl is greatest when the local community has not<br>
planned for growth, and has no land use controls in place. In this case,developers often make<br>
more of the decisions about the future of a community than the residents or elected officials. <br>
Georgia has mandated that local governments must produce a comprehensive plan, including an<br>
existing and future land use map, under the Georgia Planning Act of 1989. A required<br>
component of these plans is a section on historic resources and how the community intends to<br>
incorporate these resources into future development.<br>
<br>
Comprehensive planning is a good first step for communities to think about what type of future<br>
they want. Often, however, the plans are not implemented and are not incorporated into local<br>
land use regulations. It is important for local governments to realize that planning is not in<br>
conflict with growth, but is a way to preserve those aspects of a community that are important to<br>
its quality of life, while guiding the growth that will occur. Comprehensive land use planning and<br>
regulation can be an effective tool to achieve growth management and historic preservation goals.<br>
<br>
One method by which planning can promote growth while maintaining a community's character<br>
and quality of life is through a concept called &quot;sustainability.&quot; This approach to community<br>
planning emphasizes long-term planning, rather than meeting only immediate needs, and the<br>
exploration of creative approaches to accomplish change. Sustainable development techniques<br>
include the acknowledgement that factors such as land use, environmental concerns, housing and<br>
transportation systems are overlapping issues that require an integrated strategy, not isolated<br>
solutions. The goal of sustainable development is to create communities of enduring value and<br>
long-term viability. A component of sustainable development is &quot;neo-traditional design,&quot; that is,<br>
using traditional (historic) development patterns in the creation of new urban and suburban<br>
communities. <br>
<br>
The growing interest in sustainable communities among both environmentalists and<br>
preservationists will provide opportunities for conservation and preservation organizations to<br>
work together more in the future. The rapid sprawl that characterizes Georgia's fast-paced<br>
growth adversely affects both natural and historic resources and may become the top issue for<br>
preservationists and conservationists as we approach the year 2000.<br>
<br>
The urban areas of Georgia face some of the same development pressures, especially on their<br>
edges, but they have a much higher concentration of historic resources within their central<br>
business districts and intown neighborhoods. Decaying and outdated infrastructure, underutilized<br>
buildings, vacant lots and a perception of crime and neglect are often seen as roadblocks to<br>
preservation. Here, the threats to historic resources often come from deferred maintenance,<br>
abandonment, disinvestment, or new development at any cost. The prosperity of the suburbs at<br>
the expense of the central city is a shortsighted approach to regional social and economic success. <br>
A strong central city and intown neighborhoods can serve as a solid foundation for sustained,<br>
long-term vitality. Historic preservation can be an effective tool to facilitate the revitalization of<br>
our urban areas. <br>
<br>
Housing rehabilitation programs can provide affordable homes to inner-city residents. <br>
Preservation can also lure middle income residents back into the city. The residential rebirth of<br>
cities is the single most important factor in their revitalization. Facade rehabilitation programs can<br>
act as an incentive for owners of commercial property to improve their buildings, and can work in<br>
conjunction with the federal Investment Tax Credit to provide a stimulus for the revitalization of<br>
commercial areas. <br>
<br>
Rural areas experiencing population decline are perhaps at greatest risk. With little economic<br>
activity, the historic resources in these smaller communities face neglect, high vacancy rates and<br>
abandonment. If any interest is shown in these buildings, it is often for their salvage potential, or<br>
for relocation. In addition, archeological sites in rural areas are threatened by looters, taking<br>
advantage of the growing market for artifacts.<br>
<br>
With a declining population and few employment opportunities for residents in these rural areas,<br>
job creation is a major priority. Many rural communities in Georgia have used historic<br>
preservation as a basis for community and economic revitalization. Using the Main Street<br>
approach of using the existing downtown infrastructure and historic building stock, these<br>
communities have brought businesses, promotions, residents and a sense of community pride back<br>
to declining business districts.<br>
<br>
Historic buildings are sometimes erroneously associated with a community's decline while new<br>
buildings seem to symbolize economic revitalization. The underpinning for any efforts to use<br>
historic preservation is education. Residents need to be made aware that historic resources are<br>
what helps to make their community a special place. They need to know what makes these<br>
buildings, sites and places historically significant, worthy of preservation, and important for the<br>
community's future. <br>
<br>
The large percentage of black Georgians will have an increasing impact on preservation. Interest<br>
in the historic African-American resources of Georgia is increasing at the same time those<br>
resources are rapidly disappearing. More information about the importance of black history and<br>
the places associated with it needs to be made available to a widespread audience. Awareness of<br>
the importance of historic preservation and support for it statewide by the African-American<br>
community will be a significant factor in the ultimate success of preservation in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Housing Trends<br>
<br>
According to 1990 census data, Georgia contains 2.6 million total housing units. Of this total,<br>
10.3% or 271,000 units are vacant. It is estimated that almost 382,000 units or 14.3% of the total<br>
were constructed before 1950.<br>
<br>
The number of persons per household has declined in Georgia by almost 52%, from 4.4 persons in<br>
1930, to 2.6 in 1990. Although household size has decreased, the number of households has<br>
increased dramatically. The population grew by 18.6% in the 1980s, but the number of<br>
households grew by 26.4%. Of all households, 54% contain either one or two persons, and only<br>
10% contain five or more persons.<br>
<br>
Homelessness, housing for people with special needs, and affordability of housing are problems<br>
the state and communities will continue to confront. Historic resources can play a larger role in<br>
providing solutions. Historic hotels and warehouses are being converted to Single Room<br>
Occupancy housing or halfway houses for the homeless, people with AIDS, and the elderly. <br>
Intown historic neighborhoods offer the best chance for creating affordable neighborhoods<br>
through rehabilitation. <br>
<br>
The retention or increase of middle and upper income residents in the central or intown<br>
neighborhoods in order to create viable communities is a growing issue in Georgia's cities. <br>
Recycling of intown historic neighborhoods contributes to downtown revitalization -- by creating<br>
24-hour downtowns -- and to sustainable development for more viable downtowns and intown<br>
neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
Effects of Housing Trends<br>
<br>
The creation of additional housing units increases pressure on the state's historic resources<br>
through the demolition of historic buildings and the destruction of archeological sites. Yet<br>
historic buildings offer exceptional opportunities for creative solutions to many of Georgia's<br>
housing needs.<br>
<br>
Economic Trends<br>
<br>
Economic activity in Georgia has rebounded since the recession of the early 1990s. More new<br>
jobs have been created in Georgia over the past four years than in all but two other states. In<br>
1994, one out of every nine jobs created in the nation was created in Georgia and the 1990 per<br>
capita income of the state was 91% of the national average, up 6% from 1980. In 1994 alone,<br>
132 new manufacturing plants were announced in Georgia, representing a 176% increase in the<br>
value of such investments over 1993. Even without Olympic related construction, which has<br>
accounted for much of the activity, Georgia has enjoyed significant economic growth over the last<br>
ten years. <br>
<br>
From 1984 to 1990, Georgia's total personal income increased by 60.9%, while the national<br>
average grew by only 50.4%. Two factors are primarily responsible for this increase. First, the<br>
growth is related to large numbers of well educated, new residents with high incomes. Second,<br>
Georgia enjoys a diversified economy comprised of manufacturing, agribusiness, the defense<br>
industry, services and tourism. This diversity has enabled the state to weather economic<br>
recessions better than other areas of the country. In the future, Georgia will continue changing<br>
from a manufacturing and natural resource based economy to an information and service-retail<br>
driven one that will require a better educated and highly skilled work force. <br>
<br>
Agriculture<br>
<br>
Agriculture remains the number one economic activity in Georgia. The forestry and timber<br>
industry is the leading agricultural activity, but there has been a significant and long-term decline<br>
both in the total number of farms and in the proportion of the state's land in farms over the last 40<br>
years. The total number of farms has decreased steadily from about 200,000 in 1950 to just over<br>
40,000 in 1992. Likewise, the proportion of the state in farmland has gone from almost 70% in<br>
1950 to 27% in 1992. Through mechanization and higher yields per acre, fewer farmers can<br>
produce more. Land has become valuable in growth areas for residential and commercial<br>
development, tempting farmers to sell their land.<br>
<br>
Effects of Economic Trends<br>
<br>
The effects of economic trends on historic resources closely parallel those of population. With<br>
strong economies in north Georgia, portions of the mountains and along the coast, development<br>
threatens the preservation of historic places. Development changes the landscape in profound and<br>
permanent ways. Construction of new roads, utilities, infrastructure and buildings results in loss<br>
of open space, historic structures, and archeological sites which are gone forever. Creative<br>
planning efforts need to be undertaken to allow for sustainable growth, while at the same time<br>
integrating existing historic and cultural resources. <br>
<br>
The vibrant economy of north Georgia and the coast also presents an opportunity for the<br>
preservation of historic areas. New businesses can be located in historic commercial districts,<br>
unused mill complexes or historic school buildings no longer needed for education. Declining<br>
inner-city neighborhoods can be revitalized with new residents living in historic homes or<br>
compatible infill construction. Developers need to be made aware of the advantages of using<br>
historic buildings for their projects. Information about the cost/benefit ratio of rehabilitating<br>
historic buildings, the available tax benefits, and positive economic effects of preservation on a<br>
community need to be communicated to decision makers and developers.<br>
<br>
The rehabilitation of historic structures is competitive with the cost of comparable new<br>
construction, especially when the available incentives are used for preservation, and when the full<br>
costs of demolition, land development and infrastructure are included in the cost of new<br>
construction. A new building will often be a structure of much lower quality and have a shorter<br>
life expectancy than a rehabilitated historic building. High quality new construction, comparable<br>
to the historic building, will generally cost more. Too often, the cost of rehabilitation is compared<br>
to new construction costs merely on a per-square-foot basis. Such an approach is misleading<br>
because it fails to factor in the savings offered by rehabilitation since demolition, infrastructure<br>
and land preparation costs are often not required for preservation.<br>
<br>
Within the urban core of Georgia's major cities, and in declining rural areas, historic resources are<br>
not threatened with development, but with disinvestment. Underused commercial storefronts,<br>
unused upper floors of downtown buildings, and declining residential neighborhoods are threats to<br>
the future of historic resources of these communities. The utilization of existing infrastructure<br>
and buildings in these areas can be a less costly use of available economic development capital<br>
than the more expensive process of land acquisition, demolition, new construction and the<br>
extension of costly infrastructure and services. Use of existing structures by the private sector<br>
and government can help bring economic vitality back to depressed inner cities and rural<br>
communities.<br>
<br>
Governmental Change<br>
<br>
Since the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the federal government has<br>
provided support for preservation through educational programs, technical assistance, tax<br>
incentives and funding. This support has been critical to preservation efforts throughout Georgia. <br>
Since 1980, however, the financial support received in Georgia from federal sources has been<br>
tenuous. Given the current political climate at the federal level, the trend of uncertain and<br>
probably declining federal appropriations is expected to continue. State government has helped to<br>
respond to the fast growing interest in preservation and the need for technical and financial<br>
assistance in an environment of diminishing federal support. However, state government is also<br>
undergoing cuts, privatization and reorganization. How such change will affect preservation<br>
programs and funding is unclear.<br>
<br>
The major trend in government at all levels is a public perception that there is too much<br>
government, that government is too intrusive. All government activities are coming under<br>
increased scrutiny. The government's role in historic preservation will be questioned.<br>
<br>
Federal Government Influence<br>
<br>
Although its financial support is decreasing, the federal government maintains support for historic<br>
preservation in several ways. Through the investment tax credit and the low-income tax credit<br>
programs, the Internal Revenue Service allows investors to receive a tax credit on the<br>
rehabilitation of historic commercial property and the creation of low-income housing. The<br>
National Park Service provides appropriations for state preservation programs, administers the<br>
National Register of Historic Places, and distributes technical information about preservation<br>
issues. Congress has recently created a National Center for Preservation Technology and<br>
Training to assist in that effort. <br>
<br>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, through its Community Development<br>
Block Grant, HOME and HOPE programs, provides millions of dollars in funding to Georgia that<br>
can be used for the rehabilitation of substandard historic housing units. The Federal Highway<br>
Administration, through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA),<br>
has allowed federal transportation dollars to be used by the Georgia Department of<br>
Transportation for transportation enhancements that can include the acquisition and rehabilitation<br>
of historic properties and the enhancement of historic sites and districts. <br>
<br>
The Department of Defense has instituted the Legacy Program, designed to preserve historic<br>
resources located on military bases. The U.S.D.A. Forest Service has actively surveyed, managed<br>
and interpreted the extensive array of historic and archeological resources on its lands in Georgia<br>
for twenty years. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation continues to work with all<br>
federal agencies to insure that they meet their responsibilities under Section 106 of the National<br>
Historic Preservation Act to take historic resources into account in their programs and activities.<br>
<br>
Effects of Federal Involvement<br>
<br>
These programs represent a broadening, if not deepening commitment on behalf of the federal<br>
government, to create effective and meaningful stewardship of federally-owned historic property,<br>
as well as conscientious use of federal funds that affect historic resources. <br>
<br>
State Government Influence<br>
<br>
State government support for historic preservation has increased as federal support has<br>
declined. In July 1994, Governor Zell Miller elevated the Historic Preservation Section to<br>
Division status within the Department of Natural Resources. Along with this rise in position in<br>
state government, the Governor recommended and the General Assembly enacted the Heritage<br>
2000 grant program. $270,000 was made available in the form of grants in state fiscal year (SFY)<br>
1996. These grants are designed to provide funds to Georgia communities to rehabilitate their<br>
historic properties. <br>
<br>
State funding continues to support the Regional Historic Preservation Planning Program within 13<br>
of the state's 17 Regional Development Centers, with an allocation of $243,000 for SFY 1996. <br>
An annual $25,000 allocation is provided to the Division for inventory of historic resources. In<br>
addition, State monies are used to support the Georgia Main Street Program, housed in the<br>
Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism. State funds also allow the Historic Preservation<br>
Division to contract with the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation to carry out the Main Street<br>
Design Assistance Program throughout Georgia. The University of Georgia also receives an<br>
allocation through HPD to provide preservation assistance to local governments through the<br>
Office of Preservation Services. In 1993, the Historic Preservation Division completed a<br>
inventory of all State-owned historic resources as a precursor to future development of a<br>
comprehensive State-owned historic building stewardship program.<br>
<br>
The Department of Community Affairs (DCA) has also assisted communities with numerous<br>
preservation projects through its Local Development Fund, the administration of the Community<br>
Development Block Grant program to non-entitlement communities, and special appropriations.<br>
<br>
In 1989, the General Assembly passed legislation to create an ad valorem tax freeze for owners<br>
rehabilitating historic residential and commercial property. Also in 1989, the State passed the<br>
Georgia Planning Act, mandating that all Georgia communities prepare a comprehensive plan,<br>
including a section acknowledging and planning for the future of historic resources. <br>
<br>
Additional legislation passed by the General Assembly includes the Georgia Environmental Policy<br>
Act of 1991 (GEPA), requiring that historic resources be taken into account for State funded<br>
projects. In 1995, Georgia passed legislation to allow for Judicial In Rem Tax Foreclosure,<br>
facilitating the process by which local governments and nonprofit entities can take tax delinquent<br>
property and make it available for affordable housing and neighborhood redevelopment.<br>
<br>
The Georgia Civil War Commission and the Georgia State Capitol Commission were created by<br>
the General Assembly in 1993, to oversee and promote the preservation of these important and<br>
unique historic resources. In 1995, the Legislature created by resolution the Georgia Future<br>
Communities Commission to examine and make recommendations concerning the governmental,<br>
social, and economic issues confronting local governments.<br>
<br>
Effects of State Involvement<br>
<br>
State initiatives are creating a heightened awareness of the importance of historic resources and<br>
the active preservation of them. New State preservation commissions will generate increased<br>
attention to certain historic resources, as well as a need for close coordination among preservation<br>
partners. Downsizing of government, however, will cause all State agencies, including the<br>
Historic Preservation Division, to re-evaluate priorities and provide services in new ways.<br>
<br>
Transportation Trends<br>
<br>
Georgia is a state that is highly dependent upon its system of interstate highways, expressways,<br>
arterials and collector roads. The Georgia Department of Transportation has aggressively<br>
invested in construction of new roads and bridges, maintenance, rehabilitation and restoration<br>
programs. The road network includes 110,000 miles of public roads, with 18,000 miles classified<br>
as a part of the State Highway System. With the construction of new highways and the expansion<br>
of existing ones, the growth of the state transportation system will have a significant effect on the<br>
historic resources of Georgia.<br>
<br>
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act<br>
<br>
The passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) by Congress in<br>
1991 signaled the end of the Interstate era and the beginning of a new approach to transportation<br>
programs. ISTEA set out a new national transportation policy, shifting program emphasis from a<br>
single focus of building highways and bridges, to the creation and management of an integrated,<br>
multimodal transportation network. <br>
<br>
Implementation of this new policy and the eligibility for federal funding is based on compliance<br>
with new planning requirements that include public involvement and an emphasis on local needs to<br>
formulate a Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP, a three-year action plan) and<br>
the Statewide Transportation Plan (a twenty-year policy document identifying projects for the<br>
STIP). In response to these requirements the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)<br>
created the Transportation 2000 Commission, a broad coalition of interested parties, which<br>
developed a new statewide transportation plan. In surveys conducted as part of the Commission's<br>
planning process, 97% of those polled agreed that public involvement in transportation program<br>
decisions should be a continuous process and 83% felt that we must resolve or prevent the<br>
harmful effects of transportation on the natural and built environment. <br>
<br>
The new federal transportation act is having several effects on the preservation of Georgia's<br>
historic resources. The flexible funding provisions of ISTEA allow states to spend money not<br>
only on highways, but on mass transit and commuter rail systems. The Act also requires Georgia<br>
to spend at least 10% of its allocated surface transportation funds on enhancement activities<br>
which can include acquisition and rehabilitation of historic property, preservation and alternative<br>
use of abandoned railway corridors, and acquisition of easements on scenic areas or historic sites. <br>
State transportation plans must include other public policy concerns, and allow for flexible design<br>
standards for projects that affect areas of historic or scenic value.<br>
<br>
Roads and Bridges <br>
<br>
The expansion and maintenance of Georgia's system of highways and bridges continues to be the<br>
single most important element of Georgia's intermodal transportation system. The Georgia DOT's<br>
Developmental Highway System results in the widening of two-lane rural routes to four lanes and<br>
the continuation of these routes into and through many small communities. The proposed Outer<br>
Perimeter around Atlanta would affect fully one-fourth of the state through impacts to traffic, land<br>
use, air and water quality, and community economies. These &quot;improvements&quot; may encourage<br>
sprawl and occur at the expense of archeological resources, rural historic resources, historic<br>
bridges, downtown buildings or the loss of the small town, pedestrian character of communities in<br>
their path. On the other hand, improved roads sometimes allow the communities affected to<br>
recruit new industrial and commercial development and assist tourists and other motorists to more<br>
easily visit their shops and historic places. <br>
<br>
Approximately 1300 bridges still in operation on the public road system in Georgia were built<br>
prior to 1940. Many of the bridges considered eligible for the National Register of Historic<br>
Places have been determined &quot;functionally obsolete,&quot; not meeting current design and safety<br>
standards. These bridges require widening or reconstruction which can result in loss of historic<br>
character.<br>
<br>
It is important that as part of the ISTEA planning process and Section 106 review, communities<br>
make their concerns and objectives known, insuring that the designs for new or widened roads<br>
and replacement bridges take into account issues of historic resources and quality of life.<br>
<br>
Intermodal Transportation<br>
<br>
Public transportation is currently available to nearly 4 million Georgians (67% of the population),<br>
but the majority of use is concentrated in the urban and suburban areas. Survey results from the<br>
Transportation 2000 process show that 75% of those questioned would like to see improvements<br>
in the state's public transit systems. The further development of a statewide intermodal public<br>
transportation system including commuter rail, buses, and rail passenger service can minimize<br>
environmental concerns, reduce sprawl, and serve as an economic development tool. This<br>
approach could reduce the adverse impact of roads on historic resources as well as improve<br>
access to historic communities. <br>
<br>
Railroads<br>
<br>
According to the Georgia Transportation 2000 Commission, people throughout the state<br>
expressed overwhelming support for all types of rail improvements. Results of the GDOT survey<br>
indicate that 81% questioned would like to see improvements to passenger and commuter rail<br>
facilities and over 80% would be willing to pay increased fees, tolls or fares to support the cost of<br>
such improvements. <br>
Rail corridor preservation is another element of the rail improvement program. Preservation of<br>
abandoned rail corridors is critical to protect the rights of way, bridges and depots for future<br>
transportation use, and in the short term they can be utilized for walking paths, bike trails or<br>
greenways. Most of Georgia's rail corridors are historic as significant engineered structures. <br>
Many rail corridors include other historic buildings and structures, such as depots and water<br>
towers. The value of rail corridor protection is especially important in urban areas where the<br>
pressure to develop these areas is most acute. As rail lines continue to be abandoned by the<br>
railroads, and commuter rail perhaps becomes a reality in Georgia, more attention needs to be<br>
paid by the railroads to the preservation of these significant historic resources. <br>
<br>
Airports and Port Facilities<br>
<br>
As Georgia grows, the need for new or expanded ports and airports will also grow. The<br>
construction of new airports and port facilities and expansion of existing ones can have an adverse<br>
effect on historic resources. Construction can affect historic buildings and archeological sites in<br>
the impacted area. Dredging for port access along the coast can destroy underwater archeological<br>
resources or alter currents, leading to coastal erosion. The creation of new airport facilities can<br>
create increased noise and air pollution and an increase in local traffic. When planning these types<br>
of facilities, it is important to look at the possible effects on historic resources early in the<br>
planning process in order to minimize or mitigate them. <br>
<br>
Transportation 2000 Goals<br>
<br>
The goals that emerged from the Transportation 2000 process provide a clear indication of the<br>
attitudes of Georgians toward transportation and historic preservation. These goals include:<br>
preserving the unique character of Georgia's developing small cities and rural areas; supporting a<br>
demonstration program that integrates transportation planning into the community planning<br>
process; providing transportation design that is integrated with architectural and planning design;<br>
providing for the rehabilitation and adaptive use of existing historic buildings and structures; and<br>
encouraging community planning that recognizes the uniqueness and diversity of Georgia's cities<br>
and neighborhoods. <br>
<br>
Effects of Transportation Trends<br>
<br>
Evolving public attitudes, new federal legislation, the development of comprehensive plans in<br>
accordance with the Georgia Planning Act, increasing interest in preservation of historic places<br>
and community character, and increasing public participation in transportation policy will<br>
eventually bring about change in the planning and design of Georgia's transportation system.<br>
<br>
Tourism Trends<br>
<br>
Tourism in Georgia is very big business. After agriculture, tourism ranks as the second largest<br>
industry in the state. The Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism estimates that in<br>
1994, 39.47 million visitors came to Georgia, spending $12.3 billion, a 25% increase in tourist<br>
expenditures since 1989. The resultant impact of this wave of tourism is 387,659 jobs statewide, <br>
$1.13 billion in State government revenue and $658 million in revenue to local governments. <br>
Much of this tourist activity takes place in Georgia's historic downtowns, at historic sites, or in<br>
historic rural areas, bringing both the opportunity to educate visitors about our historic resources,<br>
and to raise concern over the continued welfare of these resources.<br>
<br>
With the Olympic Games in Atlanta in the summer of 1996, the city and state will be propelled<br>
onto the international stage, with residual effects that could last for years to come. The last<br>
Olympic city, Barcelona, experienced a 43% increase in tourism the year after the games. The<br>
exposure of the Olympics will help to illustrate the diversity of Georgia. The promotion of and<br>
visitation to historic districts and sites will play a major role in visitors' experience of the state. <br>
<br>
Tourism studies show that the profile of the typical tourist is changing. People today take several<br>
short vacations and weekend trips rather than one long vacation each year. They tend to visit<br>
places closer to home. Growing segments of the tourism market are retired people and<br>
professionals with considerable disposable incomes. The African-American tourism market is also<br>
growing rapidly in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Travelers are becoming more interested in looking for experiences off the interstate highways,<br>
traveling on two and four lane secondary roads. Taking advantage of this interest, communities<br>
have worked together to promote a critical mass of attractions such as the Antebellum Trail<br>
through central Georgia. By marketing historic districts, house museums, and landscapes, along<br>
with other attractions, communities can enhance their appeal to tourists. For this to happen,<br>
however, the historic resources must exist, be in good physical shape, be accessible to the public,<br>
and be interpreted accurately. <br>
<br>
For an effective statewide heritage tourism strategy, Georgia must develop better regional and<br>
state heritage tourism marketing strategies, and also improve its &quot;resource base&quot; (i.e. buildings,<br>
sites, etc.). There must be something there and worthwhile for tourism professionals to market. <br>
<br>
Historic properties already play a large role in the tourism economies of Savannah, Atlanta,<br>
coastal Georgia, Macon, Augusta, Columbus and the Georgia mountains. In addition, many<br>
smaller communities in Georgia are capitalizing on their historic appeal and Main Street affiliation,<br>
providing a quality experience for the traveler. <br>
<br>
There has recently been an increase in visitation of sites important to African-American history. <br>
Communities such as Savannah, Augusta, Macon and Atlanta have created walking and driving<br>
tours of historic African-American sites, helping to interpret this important aspect of Georgia's<br>
history. American Indian sites, such as New Echota and Etowah Mounds, continue to attract<br>
tourists. The Department of Natural Resources has taken the lead in managing and interpreting<br>
these sites as part of the state parks and historic sites system.<br>
<br>
Other popular tourist destinations in Georgia are the state's Civil War battlefields and sites. The<br>
National Park Service manages several of these sites such as Andersonville National Historic Site,<br>
Chickamauga National Military Park and Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. State<br>
and local governments in Georgia are active in preserving, protecting and marketing some lesser<br>
known Civil War sites. Bringing the tourism potential of these sites to fruition can have a<br>
significant effect on local economies. The challenge is to be able to capitalize on these resources,<br>
while at the same time preserving and protecting the sites, vistas and open space that accurately<br>
convey the historic experience.<br>
<br>
Effects of Tourism Trends<br>
<br>
The preservation and promotion of historic sites, &quot;heritage tourism,&quot; is a major component of<br>
tourism activity in Georgia. Up to 38% of visitors surveyed at Georgia Welcome Centers planned<br>
to visit historic or cultural sites during their stay. This percentage would grow significantly if<br>
Georgia were marketed more aggressively as a place to experience history. Currently, only a few<br>
areas are marketed that way, and heritage tourism is a much larger part of those areas' tourism<br>
industry. The popularity of heritage tourism can have a positive effect on the preservation of<br>
historic districts and sites by bringing economic benefits to their communities. In addition, the<br>
attention can raise awareness among local citizens to the importance of the long-term preservation<br>
of their historic resources. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, heavy visitation to a historic site can result in deterioration if not carefully<br>
managed. Wear and tear, parking, insensitive adjacent development and inappropriate<br>
maintenance and repair can have detrimental effects on the integrity of historic property. As<br>
heritage tourism grows, it will become increasingly important for managers of historic sites and<br>
areas to be educated in the appropriate preservation techniques and methods necessary to<br>
maintain, interpret and protect these fragile resources. <br>
<br>
Historic Preservation Trends<br>
<br>
Historic preservation as a profession has broadened its scope in recent years and become more<br>
accepted as a discipline. This has led to the acceptance of professional and technical standards as<br>
well as the use of more sophisticated tools to accomplish preservation goals. <br>
<br>
Education<br>
<br>
Four universities and colleges in Georgia currently offer advanced degree programs in the<br>
preservation field. Historic preservation degrees are offered by Armstrong State College,<br>
Georgia State University, The Savannah College of Art and Design, and the University of<br>
Georgia. Formal training in the documentation, evaluation and protection of historic places can<br>
only increase the effectiveness of preservation programs and projects. Graduates of these<br>
educational programs have helped to raise the level of professional expertise in preservation and<br>
have brought an awareness of the preservation ethic to other fields such as architecture, landscape<br>
architecture, planning, archeology, anthropology, law, and real estate development. More<br>
information about preservation needs to be provided to students pursuing degrees in these and<br>
other fields.<br>
<br>
Even with the commitment by the higher education institutions in the state to the preservation<br>
field, much more education and training needs to be done. Public officials, especially local and<br>
State representatives need to be better informed about the benefits of historic preservation to their<br>
communities and the state. Workshops explaining historic preservation and its potential benefits<br>
need to be made available to developers, planners, government leaders, architects, and other<br>
professionals affecting historic resources. Owners of historic buildings and archeological sites<br>
need to be educated as to the importance of these places and the appropriate techniques to insure<br>
their preservation. <br>
<br>
Most importantly, historic preservation needs to be taught on a widespread basis to school<br>
children throughout the state. Heritage education should include an awareness of historic<br>
buildings, districts and archeological sites as a tangible link to the history of the community, state<br>
and nation. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation has sought to assist K through 12<br>
teachers in making better use of their community's historic and cultural resources as a regular part<br>
of the school curriculum. <br>
<br>
Those individuals involved directly in preservation projects such as contractors, craftspeople,<br>
architects and designers need to know not only the skills of their profession, but the overall goals<br>
of a restoration or rehabilitation project and to understand more about the philosophy that<br>
underlies decisions. <br>
<br>
Information about current preservation techniques, materials and methods need to be available to<br>
those individuals making decisions about and directly affecting historic property. <br>
<br>
Technology<br>
<br>
Recent technological advances have also made archeological investigation less expensive and<br>
more accurate. Remote sensing devices have dropped in price and become more powerful,<br>
allowing investigators to locate and map sites without ground disturbance. Unfortunately, the<br>
widespread availability of this type of sophisticated equipment allows looters to locate and<br>
damage these sites as well. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is also being used much more<br>
frequently to assist with rehabilitation decisions for historic buildings and districts.<br>
<br>
The use of sophisticated mapping techniques such as Geographic Information Systems and Global<br>
Positioning Systems is assisting preservationists with architectural and archeological surveys. <br>
This helps local planning agencies take historic sites into consideration when making land use<br>
decisions. GIS is perhaps the single most important technological improvement revolutionizing<br>
how survey data is stored, manipulated, and made available to others. GIS can speed up decision<br>
making, especially in planning and in Section 106 review, more than any other program<br>
improvement. Historic resource data is, unfortunately, not yet available in GIS format in Georgia<br>
except in a few regional or local planning agencies. <br>
<br>
Current technology can also be used as an effective means of public education. Videotapes and<br>
interactive video conferencing can be low-cost alternatives to visiting individuals and communities<br>
in a state as large and diverse as Georgia. Use of the Internet, the Worldwide Web, image<br>
processing, and other relatively new technologies is just beginning to be used in the preservation<br>
field, but will certainly increase and revolutionize how preservation communication, training and<br>
assistance is done.<br>
<br>
Computer technology is being increasingly used as an information management tool for historic<br>
resource survey data, as well as tracking programs and review projects within state and federal<br>
offices. <br>
<br>
Partnerships<br>
<br>
For preservation to be most effective, there must be a link between the private, public and<br>
nonprofit sectors working toward common preservation goals. Groups such as local historical<br>
societies, museums and preservation commissions need to work closely with the Historic<br>
Preservation Division, the university preservation programs, and statewide organizations like the<br>
Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, and on the national level with the National Park Service<br>
and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In addition, these organizations need to find<br>
common ground with organizations that advocate similar goals such as the Trust for Public Land,<br>
the Georgia Conservancy, the Georgia Municipal Association, the Society for Georgia<br>
Archeology, and others.<br>
<br>
Preservationists need to continue to bring their message to nontraditional forums that affect<br>
historic resources. Bankers, state and local officials and planners, educators, realtors and<br>
developers should continue to be informed about the uses and benefits of historic preservation.<br>
<br>
Conclusions<br>
<br>
Georgia is evolving into a very different place than it was fifty, or even twenty, years ago. <br>
Preservation will be more difficult in the future in the face of such change. Yet Georgians will<br>
become more ardent supporters of preservation as a means of retaining the best of our past as we<br>
shape a new future.<br>
<br>
With the rapid increase in population in some areas of the state, preservationists need to<br>
emphasize the education of new residents as well as decision makers to the economic benefits of<br>
preservation and to its use as an effective tool for growth management.<br>
<br>
In areas of little growth, information needs to be distributed that explains how historic resources<br>
can help stimulate economic development through the use of existing infrastructure, downtown<br>
revitalization and the potential for tourism. <br>
<br>
Preservation will be enhanced by the use of new technologies. Computer technology can<br>
accelerate the documentation, identification and location of historic resources, as well as<br>
information management. Public awareness of historic preservation and heritage education can be<br>
enhanced by using new methods of interactive communication.<br>
<br>
<br>
With improved and greater amounts of information about the significance and location of historic<br>
resources, communities can be better informed and take historic places into account when<br>
planning for future growth and land use. New and better development models need to be created<br>
for communities, which emphasize sustainability and reuse of existing historic resources and<br>
infrastructure. Preservation is an important tool that can help citizens and agencies identify and<br>
preserve those aspects of their communities important to their quality of life.<br>
<br>
Preservationists, whether working on the local, regional, state or national level cannot succeed<br>
without assistance from diverse groups and individuals with similar, interconnected goals. <br>
Establishing partnerships and relationships with like-minded organizations will strengthen the<br>
effectiveness of historic preservation, increase its constituency, and continue to solidify its<br>
widespread use and acceptance. <br>

<p>CHAPTER FOUR </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Historic Preservation and How It Works</strong></font> </p>
<hr>
<p>Historic preservation is the process of identifying places, sites and resources that have survived from our past; evaluating the 
meaning and value they have for us now; and keeping, using and caring for those significant places, sites and resources so they 
will survive into the future. The preamble of the National Historic Preservation Act, passed by Congress in 1966, best 
expresses the value of historic preservation: &quot;The spirit and direction of the nation are founded upon and reflected in its historic 
heritage; the historical and cultural foundations of the nation should be preserved as a living part of our community life and 
development in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people.&quot; </p>
<p>The preservation process is accomplished in a variety of ways. It may involve survey, evaluation and designation, legal 
protection, planning, archeological research and investigation, rehabilitation, interpretation, acquisition and/or adaptive reuse. </p>
<p>There is a growing desire to preserve Georgia's heritage and historic places as the state continues to change. The preservation 
constituency includes historic property owners and activists, planners and developers, elected officials and professionals, 
African-Americans and American Indians, archeologists and architects, Civil War enthusiasts and Civil Rights activists, 
non-profit organizations and government agencies, academic institutions, environmentalists and downtown business owners, 
farmers and suburban dwellers, open space advocates and economic development specialists, children in classrooms and 
graduate students, the poor in need of housing and museum curators interpreting our history. They support historic 
preservation for different reasons; they see its value from different perspectives. Yet they are all preservationists. </p>
<p>Preservation is no longer just one thing, it is an ever-widening sphere of influence. It includes tourism, economic development, 
open space protection, heritage education, rehabilitation of historic buildings, community conservation, affordable housing, 
neotraditional planning, sustainable development, downtown revitalization, cultural celebration, archeology, design and 
craftsmanship. The challenge for the Historic Preservation Division is to meet the needs and provide services to a diverse 
constituency at a time when the demand for preservation is growing, historic places are disappearing, and the resources to 
meet demands are shrinking. The answer to this challenge lies in strategic planning and forming new partnerships. In the new 
century, preservation will be done by non-preservationists who incorporate the protection and use of historic resources into 
their own goals and activities. </p>
<p>Georgia boasts a strong and well-organized historic preservation network. Preservation of historic places began at the local 
level and continues to occur primarily at the local level through the commitment and actions of local people and organizations. 
Support, training, technical assistance, funding and direction are provided at the state level, with reliance on the federal 
infrastructure of laws, guidelines, criteria and funding. The decision to preserve historic resources is usually made at the local 
level, either by property owners, preservation activists, local organizations, or local government. People at the local level then 
call on statewide agencies, universities, or organizations for help, or they use funds, incentives, or programs offered at the state 
level. Projects are carried out according to federal standards, often using federal dollars or incentives, or relying on federal 
laws and regulations. </p>
<p>Partnerships between different groups --each with unique abilities and resources--have been at the foundation of the 
preservation movement. Such partnerships will be even more important as we move toward the new century. It will not be 
possible for one organization, one level of government, or one group of people to fully represent all of the increasingly 
complex interests in preservation. Each group and organization will find it possible to accomplish their own preservation goals 
only by working in partnership with others. </p>
<p>Preservation at the Local Level </p>
<p>Historic preservation at the local level takes many forms. It ranges from individual preservation of a local landmark, such as a 
county courthouse, to the revitalization of a historic neighborhood or downtown. It could take the form of a preservation 
component in a comprehensive plan or the passage by city council of a historic preservation ordinance and the appointment of 
a preservation commission. All these activities are initiated within the local community, but can be encouraged and assisted by 
regional and state organizations. </p>
<p>Local Historic Preservation Planning </p>
<p>With the passage of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, communities all over the state have had the opportunity to examine 
where they are, evaluate what they have, and determine where they want to go. The identification and evaluation of historic 
resources is a required component of this planning process. By integrating historic preservation into the overall comprehensive 
planning process, local governments are being asked to consider the relationship between preservation and other aspects of 
community life. Historic preservation should be considered as communities plan for economic development, determine future 
land use, formulate a housing strategy or plan transportation improvements. </p>
<p>The basis of any preservation planning process should be an inventory and evaluation of existing historic resources (see 
Appendix A). From information gathered from comprehensive plans submitted for State review from around Georgia, it is 
evident that some communities do not have adequate inventories on which to base their evaluation. Although a &quot;windshield 
survey&quot; may be a helpful first step in gaining a broad, general impression of what and where a community's historic resources 
are, a detailed survey is needed for serious planning and preservation efforts. The Historic Preservation Division provides 
funding for comprehensive, standardized surveys. Unfortunately, since 1988 only about 24% of the state has been surveyed 
using this program due to the small amount of funds available. A recent analysis of comprehensive plans concluded that almost 
40% do not contain an adequate inventory of existing historic resources. Without a good inventory as a basis for evaluation it 
is difficult for communities to arrive at meaningful goals and implementation strategies relating to their historic resources. Given 
the low funding level available to the Division for historic resource surveys, local governments and preservation organizations 
need to find additional sources of funds for this activity which is the foundation of all preservation efforts. </p>
<p>Analysis of the historic resources component of comprehensive plans revealed that communities with Main Street programs, 
Certified Local Governments, and those that relied on a historic preservation planner at the Regional Development Center 
produced the best historic resource sections of comprehensive plans. This suggests that when trained preservation 
professionals or volunteers are active at the local level, historic resources receive more serious consideration. </p>
<p>Local Historic Preservation Commissions </p>
<p>The number of historic preservation commissions has increased rapidly over the past twenty years. In 1976 there were 492 
historic preservation commissions across the country. By 1993, that number had increased to 1,863. From 1981 to 1992 the 
number of commissions grew by over 200%. The majority of these commissions represent small and mid-sized communities. 
Nationwide, 64% of local preservation commissions function in communities of less than 50,000, and of these, one-third have 
populations under 10,000. The number of commissions in small towns continues to grow. </p>
<p>In Georgia the increase is even more dramatic. Georgia had only seven historic preservation commissions in 1976, but by 
1995 the number had grown to 74, following the passage of the Georgia Historic Preservation Act of 1980. From 1981 
through 1994, the number of commissions grew almost 500%. Along with this phenomenal growth has come increased need 
for training, information and funding. Nationwide and in Georgia, 87% of local preservation commissions receive technical 
assistance and information from the State Historic Preservation Office. </p>
<p>Whatever the motivation, communities are adopting preservation ordinances in Georgia at the rate of about 8 per year. People 
living in historic areas in Georgia are seeking and implementing this type of local regulation and protection. </p>
<p>A 1992 study by the Athens Observer illustrates one of the reasons why communities and neighborhoods are opting for local 
designation. The study looked at the average increase in fair market value for 15 streets or neighborhoods in Athens from 
1986 through 1992. Four of the 15 were in locally designated historic districts, while the other eleven were not. Research 
showed that in the eleven non-designated areas, property values increased by about 30%, but in the four designated historic 
areas the value jumped 130%. A similar study in Macon also found that property values increased significantly more in 
neighborhoods designated as local historic districts than in comparable non-designated neighborhoods. </p>
<p>In addition to enhancing property values, local historic district designation can help attract private investment to downtown 
areas, improve the livability of residential neighborhoods, utilize existing infrastructure, and empower local residents to help 
make decisions about how their community will change and grow. </p>
<p>Certified Local Governments </p>
<p>In 1995, 44 Georgia communities participated in the Certified Local Government (CLG) Program. These communities have 
chosen to enter into a &quot;preservation partnership&quot; with the Historic Preservation Division and the National Park Service. By 
passing a historic preservation ordinance and establishing a local commission that complies with the Georgia Historic 
Preservation Act, these communities have made a commitment to actively protect their historic resources. This partnership 
establishes a relationship between the local government and the state and federal agencies providing historic preservation 
services. CLGs benefit by receiving technical assistance and they are eligible for federal grant funds from the Historic 
Preservation Division. </p>
<p>CLG participation as a percentage of total preservation commissions is significantly higher in Georgia than the national 
average. In Georgia almost 60% of commissions are CLGs while nationwide only 48% of commissions are. </p>
<p>Other Local Preservation Efforts </p>
<p>Non-profit preservation organizations lead local preservation efforts in all of Georgia's major cities. Their functions and 
services vary from one town to another, but all are leaders in advocating for preservation. Main Street programs that promote 
downtown revitalization through economic restructuring, organization, design and preservation, and promotion are bringing 
historic downtowns back to life in 35 cities. Local heritage museums house archival collections and genealogical resources, 
and present exhibits on local history and culture. Countless individuals become active in local issues to protect historic 
resources. Owners of historic property continue to protect and rehabilitate their historic properties, sometimes without even 
realizing that they are the backbone of the historic preservation movement. </p>
<p>Needs at the Local Level </p>
<p>The most requested assistance from the local level is funding for the preservation of specific structures within communities. 
Rehabilitation projects can be expensive, and local governments and non-profit organizations often do not have the means to 
carry out these projects without help. In addition, communities and individuals need technical assistance on current 
preservation techniques, materials and design. </p>
<p>Local governments need more funding to undertake and update comprehensive historic resource surveys to better understand 
their historic resources and how to plan for their future. Historic resource inventories can also serve to educate the community 
and local officials about the location and significance of historic places. </p>
<p>Communities also want assistance with enactment of historic preservation ordinances and creation of historic preservation 
commissions. Those communities that already have commissions are in need of more training for commission members. In a 
recent National Alliance of Preservation Commissions survey, 35% of Georgia's commissions stated that they have had no 
training in the last two years. Few commissions have funds to send their members to training; of the commissions responding, 
79% said they have no budget at all. Local and State officials also need education in the economic, aesthetic and legal aspects 
of historic preservation. </p>
<p>Local governments and commissions need more and flexible tools to implement historic preservation programs. For example, 
many communities outside of Georgia have enacted &quot;Conservation Districts&quot; that allow communities to shape change in areas 
that are special assets but that do not yet qualify as historic. Financial incentives tied to local designation or a tax credit for 
residential rehabilitation would act to stimulate the preservation of resources. </p>
<p>Regional Historic Preservation </p>
<p>Many historic preservation activities span municipal boundaries. Local governments must often work together on a regional 
level to accomplish their preservation goals. In addition, especially in rural areas of the state, local expertise on historic 
preservation is not available. Georgia has in place a network of Regional Development Centers (RDCs) which provide 
planning assistance throughout the state. Since 1978, Regional Preservation Planners have been on staff at most of the RDCs 
to assist local governments, groups and individuals with historic preservation activities. Currently, fourteen of the seventeen 
RDCs employ a Regional Preservation Planner. </p>
<p>This program has been extremely effective in bringing the programs of the Historic Preservation Division and other 
preservation related activities to regional and local constituents. With the passage of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, the 
state has mandated that all communities create a comprehensive plan. Since RDCs produce many of these plans, the Regional 
Preservation Planners have had the opportunity to integrate the preservation of historic resources into the planning process. </p>
<p>The size of Georgia and the large and growing number of requests for assistance make it virtually impossible for the Historic 
Preservation Division to provide all the assistance, visit all the projects, prepare all the plans, and respond to all the requests 
for help in Georgia. Support for continuation and expansion to all areas of the state of the Regional Preservation Planning 
Program is essential for the future of preservation. </p>
<p>Statewide Preservation Network </p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of preservation in Georgia is the strong statewide network and coordination among the various 
preservation interests throughout the state. Georgia is recognized nationally for the strength, size and accomplishments of its 
many preservation organizations, including the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, the Historic Preservation Division, the 
Georgia Alliance of Preservation Commissions, Georgians for Preservation Action, UGA's Office of Preservation Services, 
the Georgia Civil War Commission, the African-American Historic Preservation Network, the Society for Georgia 
Archeology, and the four colleges and universities that offer degrees in historic preservation, among others. With so many 
preservation leaders in Georgia's preservation movement, the challenge becomes coordinating efforts so that all preservation 
organizations communicate one preservation message, avoid duplicating services or activities, and work toward shared goals. </p>
<p>Public funding for preservation activities and projects is provided primarily by the Historic Preservation Division. The Division 
passes a large portion of its state and federal appropriations through to state and local government agencies, non-profit 
organizations, and others in the form of grants and contracts for projects. The Georgia Civil War Commission assists with 
funding for battlefield acquisition and other preservation projects related to Civil War resources. </p>
<p>The majority of preservation services are provided by the Historic Preservation Division, the Georgia Trust, and the Office of 
Preservation Services at the University of Georgia, with much help and cooperation from many others. The Historic 
Preservation Division provides a full range of services, including survey, National and Georgia Register of Historic Places 
nominations, planning assistance, environmental review, funding, information and education services, tax incentives, 
architectural technical assistance, archeology technical assistance, training, advocacy, assistance with local government 
preservation activities and ordinances. The Georgia Trust administers house museums and offers services ranging from 
heritage education, Main Street design assistance, and a statewide revolving fund, to advocacy, scholarships and awards, and 
information and education. The Office of Preservation Services provides hands-on assistance and training to local 
governments, information and education services, community planning and design assistance, and advocacy. Many other 
agencies and organizations provide additional preservation assistance and services. </p>
<p>Advocacy on preservation issues is coordinated by Georgians for Preservation Action and the Georgia Trust. Georgians for 
Preservation Action (GaPA) is a grassroots alliance coordinated by the Georgia Trust that brings together all of the major 
preservation groups, all regions of the state, and diverse perspectives to develop a coordinated approach for advocating the 
protection of historic places and support for preservation programs and funding in Georgia and at the national level. The 
Georgia Trust effectively represents its 9,300 members through advocacy activities at the local, state and national levels. </p>
<p>Historic preservation policy of the State of Georgia is carried out primarily by the Historic Preservation Division. The Division 
implements or monitors laws and regulations pertaining to historic resources, proposes or comments on new legislation that 
would promote preservation goals, prepares the historic preservation plan for Georgia, and provides advice on preservation 
policy to the Governor, the Commissioner of Natural Resources, and other agencies. The Division carries out its duties and 
administers its programs uder legislative authority of federal and state law. </p>
<p>Georgia is fortunate to have so many strong and successful statewide preservation leaders. As the preservation constituency 
continues to broaden; as preservation issues become more complex; as the emphasis for preservation continues to shift to the 
local level; as funding and programs that support preservation shrink; and as change continues to transform Georgia, statewide 
organizations and agencies must double their efforts to coordinate and support one another to provide the most effective 
preservation program possible. </p>
<p>Federal and National Preservation Support </p>
<p>The federal government provides the foundation upon which many local and state historic preservation activities are built. The 
National Historic Preservation Act, passed in 1966 and amended in 1980 and 1992, defined national policy on historic 
preservation, established the National Register of Historic Places, created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and 
created the system of State Historic Preservation Offices through which preservation funds and services are provided. 
Sections 106 and 110 of the Act establish the responsibility of all federal agencies to inventory, designate, and protect historic 
properties which they own, and to take historic resources into account in federally funded, licensed and permitted activities. </p>
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) administers the Historic Preservation Fund, from which annual appropriations are made to 
support the mandated activities of State Historic Preservation Offices. The NPS also administers the National Register of 
Historic Places, and many other programs and activities essential to preservation. The National Register criteria and the 
Secretary of the Interior's Standards have become the benchmarks by which historic resources and preservation activities are 
measured. The NPS also develops preservation technical information and distributes it nationwide. </p>
<p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation is the national non-profit historic preservation organization that was chartered by 
Congress in 1949. The National Trust operates house museums, provides funding for preservation projects, advocates for 
preservation, provides information, provides membership services, and works in cooperation with state and local 
organizations to help preserve historic places. Its regional offices are especially helpful in providing technical assistance and 
funding for preservation projects. </p>
<p>Other national organizations, including the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, Preservation Action, 
the Society for American Archeology, and many more, work to promote the preservation and protection of historic places. </p>
<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>The historic preservation network is growing. As the network grows, it becomes more complex, with more issues to cover 
and more points of view to consider. Yet this network of organizations, agencies, and individuals has developed into an 
effective and committed movement working to shape the future of communities in Georgia and throughout the nation. </p>
