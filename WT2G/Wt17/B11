HOW SENATOR SHELBY WOULD REQUIRE PRISONERS TO WORK AND STUDY -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>HOW SENATOR SHELBY WOULD REQUIRE PRISONERS TO WORK AND STUDY</h3></i>
<p>By Patrick F. Fagan<br>
William H.G. FitzGerald Senior Fellow in Family and Cultural Issues<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 420<br>
July 5, 1995<br></center><hr size=3 Width=30%>
<p>
    Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL) has introduced a bill to reform the operation of America's
prisons. S. 930 requires inmates in federal prisons, and in the prisons of states receiving federal
monies under the 1994 crime bill for building new prisons, to work 48 hours and study 16 hours per
week. The legislation also repeals the social work requirements of last year's crime bill.
<p>
    Though many complain of overcrowding in prisons, Americans are far more concerned about
the early release of prisoners -- many inmates are released after serving only a small fraction of their
sentences. Despite the widespread feeling that a sentence imposed should be a sentence served, a
large portion of the nation's felonies are committed by those out on parole or on probation. Thus, the
overriding need is not relief from overcrowding, but more prisons to protect society from those who
harm other citizens and their property.
<p>
    Serious prison overcrowding urgently needs to be tackled. That means new facilities must be
built. But it is also important for taxpayers and lawmakers to realize that many prisons spend an
enormous amount of money on an extensive array of sports and recreational facilities for prisoners.
The use of these facilities is treated in Senator Shelby's bill as a privilege to be earned by completing
work and study, not as a right to accompany incarceration. These privileges -- some that many
taxpayers do not have for themselves -- include the use of weightlifting and bodybuilding equipment;
access to sports (basketball, football, baseball), recreation, and television; unmonitored phone calls;
instruction and training in martial arts (boxing, wrestling, judo, karate); the use of musical equipment;
in-cell cooking privileges (coffee pots and hot plates); permission to dress and groom in a manner
different from uniform prison standards; and access to equipment for publishing and broadcasting.
<p>
    Rarely are these facilities provided because the prison system wishes to do so. Judges
interpreting civil rights law impose these changes on officials through court order. John DiIulio,
professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University, writes:  "What prosecutors and other
law enforcement officials understand is that the federal courts have gone overboard in protecting
prisoners' rights. They have done so at the expense of making a mockery out of democratically
enacted laws. Some federal judges have made themselves the sovereigns of the cell blocks, forcing
changes in operations that have resulted in inmate-on-inmate murders, inmate-on-staff assaults, a
dramatic increase in spending on amenities and services for inmates, and the early release each year
of literally hundreds of thousands of violent or repeat criminals.1"
<p>
    Senator Shelby's bill would require prisoners to work and study for 64 hours per week, thus significantly
reducing the "free time" prisoners currently have to enjoy a host of amenities. The bill also requires that the food
prisoners are given not be superior in quality or quantity to the food made available to enlisted personnel in the United
States Army.
<p>
    A debate on the relative effectiveness of rehabilitation and punishment has swung back and forth in the
penology literature for over a century. The appeal of the Shelby proposal is that it has rehabilitation, education, work,
and punishment all in one package. Furthermore, the reform bill requires a prisoner's life to be similar to that of a
hardworking young taxpayer who holds a job and goes to college at night.
<p>
    The literature on the effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts alone is weak at best. The literature on the
effectiveness of work and study is somewhat stronger. Some of the research difficulty comes from definitions and
understandings of rehabilitation. There are two dimensions to rehabilitation:  deep interior dispositions and developed
capacities. It is difficult even for friends to know, still less to change, the deep interior dispositions of others. It is
especially so for prison staff (even counselors and therapists) when they try to reach the prisoner. However the second
dimension of developing capacities is less dependent on changed interior dispositions. The person who works long and
hard acquires the capacity to work long and hard. The person who learns to work harder for more privileges acquires
an even greater capacity. And the person who studies develops his intellectual and operational capacities. All of these
will be of use to the prisoner when he regains his freedom.
<p>
    Sustained work for most people involves some form of suffering. At a minimum, a prisoner ought to
experience the normal suffering of the work week which the average citizen has to undergo.
<p>
    Many hardworking citizens do not have either the time or the money needed to join fitness clubs, take part in
sports, or receive training in the martial arts. They do not have easy access to many of the facilities made available to
prisoners. America's working poor have a life that is harder than that of many of federal and state prisoners. This
violates fundamental notions of justice and common sense.
<p>
    Many of the more luxurious facilities and privileges available to prisoners are beyond the reach of most low-income, law-abiding taxpayers and middle-income taxpaying parents with growing children. These privileges are in
place because of federal judges who dictate these facilities in the prisons. As DiIulio explains, the actions of these
judges undermine law enforcement. But by making work and study requirements part of federal law, the Shelby bill
makes it more difficult for judges to require prisons to provide such extensive facilities and privileges.
<p>
    The Shelby bill could be improved, and the principles of federalism better defended, if the bill addressed only
future prisons that states want to build with federal money. To require that all prisons in states  receiving
construction grants be run as Senator Shelby proposes would improve their method of operation, but
that requirement violates the central tenet of federalism -- leaving to the states what is not prohibited
by the  Constitution. With this modification, states which do not like the strings attached would not
have to take the  federal monies for future prisons and could provide unlimited television and karate
training if they wished. Those which agree with Senator Shelby's approach to running prisons could
apply for the money and build and manage their prisons along these lines. Senator Shelby expects
many states to use these federal monies and the federal requirements in the law as a way to break the
hold of micromanaging federal judges. If judges wanted to challenge this way of running prisons,
they would have to deal with Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court. They could not simply impose
court orders on prison officials.<p>

<p>
Francis A. Biunno, a Philadelphia trial judge, had just sentenced a murderer to death. He then turned to the courtroom, called on those present to sit down, and asked the public to reflect on the breakdown of our democratic system that had led to the killing.<p>
The murder in question was of a 21-year-old rookie police officer, Daniel Boyle, who stopped a stolen car in North Philadelphia. The driver of the stolen car, Edward Bracey, fired numerous shots through the windshield of the patrol car, hitting the young officer in the head. A police radio tape chillingly captured the fatal shots and the fallen officer's final words. A few days later Danny's father, veteran Philadelphia police detective Patrick Boyle, buried his only son.<p>
This tragedy didn't have to happen. Philadelphia police, Judge Biunno said, had previously arrested Bracey for car theft. Twice Bracey had been released without bail or supervision under terms of an order issued by a federal court. Twice Bracey had failed to show up for trial—in fact, he was a fugitive from justice when he killed Officer Boyle. This killing wouldn't have taken place, Biunno suggested, if the federal court hadn't required the defendant's release.<p>
Criticism of a federal court on the part of a local trial judge is highly unusual. But Biunno's statement reflected the anger and frustration that officials in Philadelphia harbor toward a federal order that has wreaked havoc on their city's criminal-justice system. The court order to which Biunno referred places a cap on the number of inmates in Philadelphia prisons, and it sharply restricts the ability of judges to imprison defendants prior to trial.<p>
Last year, the city's judges were forced to release defendants in 15,000 cases. Thanks to the court order, the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justice—defendants who have been charged with a crime but do not even bother to show up for trial. Philadelphia police arrest the same criminals over and over again, only to see them immediately released. In the nine years since the order was approved by Judge Norma Shapiro, of the U.S. District Court, defendants released under federal court order have gone on to commit tens of thousands of crimes—including thousands of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery.<p>
The federal court's order is technically called a "consent decree," because it was agreed to by a previous mayor of Philadelphia. But it no longer enjoys the consent of the governed. Philadelphia's elected leaders, including its present mayor, its district attorney, and most of its city council, are deeply opposed to the consent decree but powerless to overturn it. Philadelphia may be the home of the Liberty Bell, but the federal consent decree is making a mockery of the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.The Philadelphia prisons, which house defendants before trial and sentenced prisoners, have been the subject of various class-action lawsuits since 1972. Past conditions in the prisons have been unacceptable. Over the years, many experts have observed inadequate medical care that has led to the death of inmates, unsanitary food preparation, vermin infestation, and poor plumbing, ventilation, and heating.<p>
In 1986, these conditions prompted inmates at an old, decrepit facility called Holmesburg Prison to file a lawsuit against then-mayor W. Wilson Goode. The mayor decided to settle the case rather than go to trial. The resulting federal consent decree, agreed to by Goode's lawyers, did nothing to address medical care or other conditions in the city's prisons. Rather, it sought to limit the number of prisoners, and, more important, forbade pretrial detention for defendants accused of broad categories of crime. The architects of the plan apparently presumed that reducing the number of prisoners would improve the prison environment for the remaining inmates.<p>
Instead of individualized bail review, with Philadelphia judges considering a criminal defendant's dangerousness to others or his risk of flight, the consent decree requires a "charge-based" system of prison admissions. Suspects charged with so-called "non-violent" crimes, including stalking, car jacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terroristic threats, and gun charges, are not subject to pretrial detention.<p>
In determining pretrial detention, Philadelphia judges can no longer consider a defendant's prior record, his history of failing to appear in court, his mental-health history, his ties to the community, or his drug or alcohol dependency. These factors become completely irrelevant. A major drug dealer carrying a loaded Uzi and a plane ticket out of the country cannot be detained before trial in Philadelphia.<p>
As a result of this system, Philadelphia has become an especially attractive location for drug dealing. Narcotics agents assigned to the international airport routinely apprehend (and are forced to release) drug couriers, who have been assured that carrying over $100,000 of marijuana to Philadelphia is risk free. One newly arrested drug dealer, knowing that he would be released in a matter of hours, cheerfully gave his pretrial bail interviewer a phone number where he could be reached—-in Cali, Colombia. <p>
Another drug dealer, Walter Lewis, unwittingly schooled undercover narcotics officers on the benefits of dealing drugs in Philadelphia. Lewis had been awaiting trial in Philadelphia for drug dealing but had already been released because of the federal consent decree. Undercover narcotics agents from neighboring Montgomery County arranged a narcotics deal on City Line Avenue, the street dividing Montgomery County from Philadelphia. When Lewis arrived, he tried to convince the undercover officers to move the drug deal to the Philadelphia side of the street. He carefully explained that they could all be sent to jail if they stayed in Montgomery County. After the officers refused to move, Lewis mistakenly let greed guide him. He completed the deal, the officers immediately arrested him, and he went straight to jail, where he remained until trial. If the deal had occurred in Philadelphia, he would have been released in a matter of hours. <p>
The consent decree has crippled Philadelphia's already struggling criminal-justice system. Once criminals knew that they could not be detained prior to trial no matter how many times they failed to appear for court, Philadelphia began recording unprecedented fugitive rates. A study conducted by John Goldkamp and Kay Harris, nationally recognized experts on the bail process, found, for example, that 76 percent of all Philadelphia drug dealers become fugitives within 90 days of their arrest. Nationally, only 26 percent of drug dealers become fugitives within one year of their arrest. By comparison, only 3 percent of Philadelphia defendants charged with aggravated assault—a crime not subject to the release provisions of the federal consent decree—fail to appear for court.<p>
The skyrocketing fugitive rate has produced a system with more defendants in fugitive status than awaiting trial. In the first six months of 1994, over 11,000 new bench warrants (the arrest document issued when a criminal defendant does not appear for a court hearing) were issued for defendants released under the federal consent decrees, representing 74 percent of all the bench warrants issued during this period. Under the consent decree, the number of fugitives in Philadelphia has nearly tripled from 18,000 to almost 50,000, equivalent to a year's worth of criminal prosecutions. And no wonder: Under the consent decree, state courts are powerless to compel a defendant's appearance in court.<p>
Unfortunately for Philadelphians, the defendants released because of the consent decree do not lay low—they just keep on committing new crimes. In an 18-month period (1993 and the first six months of 1994), Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 defendants released because of the consent decree. These defendants were charged with 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing crimes, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.<p>
These crimes cannot all be attributed to the federal consent decree; some defendants would have been released under normal Pennsylvania procedures. But apparently half or more of these crimes could have been prevented. Goldkamp and Harris found that pretrial detainees released under the consent decree committed crimes at more than twice the rate of defendants released under state-court bail programs. Within 90 days of release, 18 percent of federally released defendants were rearrested for new crimes, compared with an 8 percent rearrest figure for comparable state bail programs. <p>
Retailers complain of a sharp increase in shoplifting and robberies by criminals immune from incarceration. In April, Charles Pembroke was released for the fifth time in 1995 because of the Philadelphia prison cap. In the last six months, Philadelphia police have arrested Pembroke three times for retail theft, once for robbing a pharmacy with a starter pistol while threatening to kill the victims, and once for drug dealing. Pembroke has failed to appear for court seven times and, as of this writing, is a fugitive on three of his cases. Philadelphia's criminal-justice system just keeps seeing the same defendants over and over again, but can't do anything until they commit a crime so serious that the consent decree finally permits the prison to admit them.<p>
The consent decree also weakens the effectiveness of programs for criminal defendants who never would have been detained prior to trial. State judges are no longer allowed to sanction those criminal defendants who violate conditions of bail, fail to appear for trial, or commit new crimes. State-court bail programs have atrophied into virtual non-existence. Conditional-release programs providing drug treatment, aimed at lifting new offenders out of their recently acquired lives of drugs and crime, are forced to wait for offenders to become serious criminals with a long-term addiction. <p>
The case of Frederick Hightower vividly demonstrates the absurdity of the consent decree. Hightower was a trained helicopter mechanic from a solid family who became addicted to crack at age 29. He quickly turned to burglaries.<p>
Given Hightower's age, lack of prior criminal-justice contacts, and long-term ties to the community, the local court system (had it remained in charge of the pretrial detention process) probably would have released him without bail for his first two burglaries. But by the time he was arrested for his third burglary, the local judge would have suspected a drug problem, sent him to jail, and permitted his conditional release (again without posting bail) a few days later into an in-patient drug treatment program. If this had worked (admittedly an optimistic outlook) and he had remained in treatment, he would have been a prime candidate for a sentence of probation with the condition of continued drug treatment.<p>
But the federal consent decree wouldn't allow the local criminal-justice system to operate. Without the threat of pretrial incarceration, Hightower wouldn't enter a drug treatment program. Philadelphia wasn't permitted to keep Hightower in jail until he was finally arrested for his 10th burglary. Hightower now was no longer a candidate for probation. Instead he received a 10-year maximum sentence, and must serve a minimum of two and a half years before he is eligible for parole.<p>
The cost of this folly: numerous crime victims with substantial financial losses (and he surely wasn't caught every time); prison bed space occupied longer (a few years, at a cost of approximately $25,000 a year, instead of a few days); increased court costs (each one of his new cases involved police witnesses, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and court personnel), less chance of drug rehabilitation (the treatment came later in his addiction); and loss of tax revenues (Hightower was a skilled, employed taxpayer). <p>
The Philadelphia Federal Courthouse overlooks Independence Hall, the cradle of American liberty and the Constitution. How ironic, then, that the federal court's consent decree tramples on the right of Philadelphians to a democratic political system.<p>
Mayor Ed Rendell and District Attorney Lynne Abraham, both elected Democrats, won office pledging to do what they could to overturn the prison-cap and prisoner-release provisions of the consent decree. Philadelphia's top leaders, including most of the city council, are united in their view that the federal court's rules on pretrial release of defendants are a serious threat to public safety, effectively decriminalizing property crime in Philadelphia, and harming the financial viability of the city. But the federal court has rejected all challenges to the consent decree, and shows no indications of ceding oversight over the issue. Philadelphia's elected leaders are powerless to change agreements made by a prior administration, and so powerless to set their own criminal-justice priorities.<p>
Our democratic system presumes that policies made by today's elected leaders, whether by legislation, regulation, or policy statements, can be altered by their successors in office. Through periodic elections, the public can throw out arrogant public officials who try to insulate their governmental vision from change or from the will of the electorate. Philadelphians do not consent to the consent decree that is destroying their criminal justice system. It's time that Philadelphia's elected leaders be allowed to do the job for which they were elected. Isn't that what America's independence was all about?

<P>	   <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n New Year's Eve 1975, after an evening of taking LSD and watching cop 
shows on television, 15-year-old Raul Meza showed up at a convenience store near his 
house in Austin, Texas, armed with a deer rifle. Meza emptied the cash register, then 
marched the clerk, a 20-year-old college student named Derly Ramirez, into the walk-in 
freezer. Meza shot him in the back and left him for dead.</P>
<P>	Ramirez recovered to testify against the man who wounded him. Meza received a 
20-year sentence, and served five years before getting out on parole.</P>
<P>	On January 3, 1982, months after his release, 21-year-old Raul Meza abducted 
Kendra Page, a third-grader, as she rode her bicycle near her home in southeast Austin. 
Meza tortured, raped, and strangled the girl, then left her body behind a dumpster. Three 
days later, he surrendered to the police. Meza received 30 years for the killing.</P>
<P>	While behind bars, Meza racked up demerits for various infractions, and four 
years were added to his sentence after guards found a knife in his cell. Meza came up for 
parole seven times, and each time it was denied.</P>
<P>	By 1993, however, prison authorities could keep Meza no longer. Under Texas 
law, he had accumulated enough credit for good behavior to qualify automatically for 
release. The state freed him under mandatory supervision, a conditional release not unlike 
parole that can be granted without the consent of the parole board.</P>
<P>	No matter how notorious, most felons leave prison with little fanfare. They re-
enter society quietly and soon become anonymous. Some begin new and honest lives. 
Many others, freed from supervision and accountable to no one, commit new crimes. 
Raul Meza might have regained his freedom in the same way. But he never got the 
chance. One hundred and forty miles from Meza's Huntsville prison cell, an Austin 
newspaper editor decided to make him famous.</P>
<P>	In 15 years of covering crimes, Jerry White, the city editor of the <I>Austin 
American-Statesman</I>, had watched scores of criminals disappear from public view after 
sentencing. Most of them left prison years before their sentences expired, often to rob, 
rape, or kill again. "It became apparent," says White, "that even though these folks are 
sentenced and sent away, the story doesn't really end." White began compiling a list of 
inmates who were "fairly notorious" in Austin. Every few months, he called the 
department of corrections to ask when inmates on his list would be eligible for parole.</P>
<P>	In June 1993, the department of corrections confirmed that Meza was due to be 
released soon. Using the state's Open Records Act, the newspaper petitioned Texas's 
attorney general and found where Meza planned to live. An article ran on the front page 
of the Sunday paper eight days before Meza's release. The headline read, "`Nothing's 
Going To Stop It': Killer of 8-Year-Old About to be Freed."</P>
<P>    In a city of about 465,000 people, the story reached 240,000 homes and provoked an 
outpouring of media attention. Film crews greeted Meza as he walked out of the state 
prison and followed him for months. Publicity, mostly bad, seemed to trail him 
everywhere. Corrections officials moved him from town to town, but in each residents 
and local politicians protested his presence. Colin Amann, a Houston lawyer who 
represented the killer after his release, says angry citizens "kicked him in the butt from 
one end of Texas to the other."</P>
<P>	For much of 1993, Texans kept on kicking. Over several months, he was shuttled 
between towns and cities all over the state. Of the 276 halfway houses that were asked to 
accept Meza, 271 refused. "Every town he went to," says Amann, "people were just 
screaming and yelling. Lots of small communities went out and bitched about it. A lot. 
And it happened every time they'd move him, they had the same outcry."</P>
<P>	In August, the parole division placed Meza on his grandparents' farm, west of San 
Antonio. On August 31, local sheriffs charged Meza with "terroristic threatening" and 
disorderly conduct for bullying his elderly grandparents. A judge later dismissed the 
charges, but the incident made nearly every newspaper in Texas. At least 1,000 local 
residents signed a petition asking the state to move Meza again. The parole division sent 
him to Austin.</P>
<P>	His new neighbors protested, held rallies, carried signs. A few moved away. The 
furor subsided a bit when the father of the murdered girl publicly called for citizens to 
give Meza the chance to start a new life. He moved into his mother's house and found a 
job. In the first 10 months of 1994, the <I>American-Statesman</I> ran more than 20 stories on 
Meza. In August 1994, he was arrested for violating the curfew provision of his parole, 
and he returned to the state prison in Huntsville.</P>
<P>	At the time Meza was taken into custody, there were more than 116,000 parolees 
in Texas, 15,000 of whom had outstanding warrants for parole violations. Yet the 
governor's fugitive squad focused its energies on Meza, the most famous one. And while 
parolees in Texas routinely get three chances to break parole before being arrested, Meza 
was taken into custody after only one violation. His supporters cried foul. But the citizens 
of Texas were the better for it.</P>
<P>   Meza needed all the attention he could get. As a group, violent sex offenders have an 
extraordinarily high rate of recidivism. In Texas, about one-third of convicted rapists are 
arrested for new crimes within two years of getting out on parole. Ordinarily, parole 
officers are not able to supervise sex offenders carefully. But because they learned from 
news reports where Meza lived, neighbors were able to keep their children out of his 
path. Relentless publicity forced a troubled parole system to work effectively. And 
information disseminated by the press helped to create thousands of civilian parole 
officers--watchful neighbors who kept an eye on him.</P>
<P> 	Publicity, however, is a blunt instrument, and others were unintentionally 
bludgeoned by Meza's fame. His relatives were humiliated. His victim's parents saw their 
tragedy replayed in the press. And Meza himself was hounded across the state. Nobody 
knows how such attention may have retarded his rehabilitation, but it may not matter. 
Despite the burdens imposed on him and his family--or, more likely, because of them--
Meza did not kill another child while out of prison.</P>
<P>	Even Meza's attorney, a self-described liberal, believes the publicity was worth 
the cost. "I think everybody should know when a parolee is coming to live in their 
neighborhood," says Colin Amann. "That's why crime is committed, because people 
don't know who the criminals are. Once they get out, let's let the entire world know 
where they are going to live. Let's let the community have some responsibility for 
keeping its thumb on them."</P>
<P>	More and more communities are clamoring for that very responsibility. Meza's 
case illustrates what most people already sense: Citizens who know their neighbors will 
be safer than those who don't. Study after study has shown anonymity to be a factor in 
many crimes. Simply put, criminals are more apt to commit crimes in neighborhoods 
where they do not know the neighbors, and where the neighbors do not know one 
another. As James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein explain in <I>Crime and Human 
Nature</I>, their expansive survey of criminology, "the more rapid the population turnover in 
an area, the higher the victimization rate, even after controlling for the racial and age 
composition."</P>
<P>	Conversely, close-knit communities tend to be resistant to predatory crime. A 
criminal is less likely to commit crimes where the neighbors recognize him, particularly if 
they know that he has a criminal record.</P>
<P>	Statistics explain why citizens have a vested interest in knowing who in their 
neighborhood has been convicted of serious offenses. Ex-cons commit a staggering 
amount of crime. As John DiIulio of Princeton University has pointed out, "within three 
years of sentencing, while still on probation, nearly half of all probationers are placed 
behind bars for a new crime or abscond." Nationally, recidivism for parolees is about the 
same as for probationers. DiIulio cites a revealing study of Florida convicts:</P>
<P>	"Between 1987 and 1991, about 87 percent of the 147,000 felons released from 
Florida prisons were released early. Fully one-third of these parolees committed a new 
crime. At points in time when they would have been incarcerated had they not been 
released early, these parolees committed nearly 26,000 new crimes, including some 4,656 
new crimes of violence--346 murders, 185 sexual assaults, 2,369 robberies, and 1,754 
other violent offenses."</P>
<P>	Not only are felons on supervised release dangerous, but there are a lot of them. In 
1993, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a total of 671,000 Americans were on 
parole or probation. There is considerable evidence that many parole and probation 
officers are responsible for far more offenders than they can possibly supervise, even 
those housed under one roof. A investigation in 1993 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 
that one of every six convicted felons placed in Colorado halfway houses escaped. That 
year, the study found, 526 felons walked away from halfway houses and into the 
surrounding neighborhoods. Seven of the escapees were convicted murderers. "In most 
cases," the paper concluded, "no one looked for them."</P>
<P>	Informed neighbors don't always just keep offenders from committing crimes; 
sometimes they can help ex-cons straighten out. Mike Elsworth got out of prison in 
Washington, D.C., for the last time on Halloween 1990, after serving two years for 
selling cocaine. Elsworth, who was paroled to the same part of town where he grew up, 
credits his neighbors for helping him keep his record clean since his release. Although he 
was shunned by at least one woman on his block, other "neighbors were supportive and 
understanding of me trying to do better once I got out. They knew I was looking for a job, 
and they would tell me about places that they knew were hiring, and some of them would 
tell me if I needed anything to come on by." Three months after his release, with the 
encouragement of his neighbors, Elsworth found a job.</P>
<P>	Elsworth says his neighbors gave him the help and attention his parole officers 
did not. In two years, Elsworth reported to five different officers. "It was like, every three 
months I had a new one," he says. "I don't know why. They really had little or no 
concern about me as a person." Elsworth met with his parole officer for 10 to 15 minutes 
every few weeks. But he saw his neighbors every day, which ultimately, he says, made all 
the difference.</P>
<P>	Of course, not all neighborhoods would take advantage of more information about 
felons. In some parts of cities, particularly in poor areas where citizens tend to live 
chaotic lives, neighbors often know who is on parole and don't care. Nor would giving 
neighbors the names and addresses of all newly released felons always benefit the felons 
themselves. Critics have long charged that releasing the names of parolees and 
probationers to the public would make it more difficult for convicted criminals to start 
successful new lives once they get out of prison. A federal judge recently struck down 
parts of "Megan's Law," a New Jersey statute requiring released sex offenders to tell 
their communities where they live. In his decision, Judge Nicholas Politan said the 
notification requirement amounted to a form of punishment, and cannot be added to 
penalties already in place before the law was passed in 1994. Requiring a convicted felon 
to notify his neighbors upon release, he wrote, would constitute a "lifelong albatross," 
and would ruin an ex-con's ability to "return to a normal, private, law-abiding life in the 
community." Judge Politan might be right. Ultimately, however, much of what would 
happen if the names of parolees were publicized is conjecture. As it stands, the identities 
of released criminals often remain shrouded in state and federal privacy laws. The Federal 
Privacy Act of 1974, for instance, generally bars authorities from divulging the names 
and addresses of parolees released from federal prisons. Most states, wary of civil-rights 
lawsuits brought by released felons, have adopted similar laws. While the intent of such 
statutes may be noble, their effect has sometimes been devastating.</P>
<P>	Last summer, the residents of Red Hook, a small town in upstate New York, paid 
the price for having an unknown felon in their midst. In June, Richard Moran, a lifelong 
criminal from the Bronx, was released from Rikers Island, where he had spent the 
previous three months on a parole violation, and placed in Red Hook's only homeless 
shelter. No one knew his criminal record. No one was watching.</P>
<P>	Had Moran's record become public, Tommy McCauliff, a 29-year-old with 
cerebral palsy, might still be alive. On a Sunday afternoon in July, McCauliff emerged 
from his apartment, staggered across the street, and bled to death on the sidewalk from a 
knife wound in his back.</P>
<P>	Police picked up Moran and charged him with second-degree murder. He was 
later convicted.</P>
<P>	By the time he came to Red Hook, Moran had spent close to half of his 43 years 
behind bars. First arrested in New York City for armed robbery in 1969, he went on to 
amass 26 different criminal charges, including several violent felonies. Within days of 
being released, Moran made his way to Shelter Plus, a state-financed boarding house for 
vagrants in Red Hook, 90 miles north. Under circumstances that are still not clear, he met 
Tommy McCauliff.</P>
<P>	When an inmate with two or more convictions is released from a state prison in 
New York, within 48 hours corrections officials must notify the police in the town to 
which he is headed. Rikers Island, however, is not a state prison, but a jail run by New 
York City. Authorities there were not required to notify police in Red Hook that Moran 
was on his way to their town. And they didn't.</P>
<P>	The state's department of social services in nearby Poughkeepsie was the only 
agency that knew about Moran's arrival in Red Hook, and New York's confidentiality 
laws require social workers to keep secret the criminal histories of their clients.</P>
<P>	"Anything in our records is confidential," says John Battistoni, the county's 
commissioner of social services. "Parolees just come in like anyone else. If they're 
without a place to go, we're required to give them shelter." Only a court order, he says, 
can force the department to divulge the names of the parolees it places in homeless 
shelters. A call from the local police department will not suffice. For employees who 
break confidentiality rules, says Battistoni, "the penalties could be severe. You'd be 
subjecting yourself and your county to all sorts of suits. It's tough stuff."</P>
<P>	All things considered, says Battistoni, he is not bothered by the secrecy. "I 
suppose people shouldn't be branded," he offers. "People are saying they'd like to know 
if a criminal is placed in their neighborhood. I often wonder what they would do with the 
information if they had it. Put a 24-hour tail on the guy?"</P>
<P>	Lisa Murray has no doubt what she would do with such information. "I would 
keep an eye on that person," she says, "and I would know if that person was near my 
child, if it was a rapist or a child molester, to get my kid away." Murray is one of five 
Red Hook women who formed a group called Concerned Citizens for a Safe Community 
after McCauliff's death. The group advocates changing the confidentiality laws they 
believe were partly responsible for the killing.</P>
<P>	Murray points out that Richard Moran is not the only criminal to move into the 
homeless shelter without the town's knowledge. Since McCauliff's death, police have 
arrested two other residents of Shelter Plus for selling drugs. "Whenever somebody gets a 
DWI or commits a robbery, it's in the paper before they're even convicted of the crime," 
she says. "So why not have a criminal who's already been convicted of a crime and 
released from prison be put in the paper saying where he's going to live?"</P>
<P>	A county legislator named Woody Klose quickly sponsored a resolution requiring 
local police to be notified whenever felons are placed in homeless shelters. Steve Saland, 
a state senator, sponsored a bill that would force corrections officials to notify towns 
whenever a parolee is about to be released into their midst. Unlike the statute in place, the 
new law would apply to jails as well as state prisons. It would require authorities to notify 
the mayor and the chief of police of the town to which the parolee is headed, as well as 
officials in the town where the crime was committed. The written statement would 
include the ex-con's physical description, his known aliases, and his criminal record. It 
would also contain his new home address. Towns would have to post the information in a 
public place, such as a bulletin board in city hall, in post offices, or in advertisements in 
local newspapers. Released offenders would be required to report to local authorities for a 
period of 10 years each time they moved to a new address in New York.</P>
<P>	Saland's notification law would apply only to paroled sex criminals, repeat 
violent offenders, and those convicted of three or more felonies. Saland says the law 
would not prevent parolees from committing new crimes. But it might help neighbors to 
protect themselves from released criminals. "All you can do is provide notice," he says. 
After that, "it's up to the community."</P>
<P>	Tommy McCauliff's death prompted New York politicians to take a new look at 
an old debate. For years, lawmakers have tried to balance the requirements of public 
safety with a belief that stigmatizing released felons makes rehabilitating them more 
difficult. Many states have compromised by requiring parolees and convicted criminals to 
register their addresses with law-enforcement officials, but not with neighbors or 
community groups. States that do provide for community notification when a felon is 
released nearly always limit the notification to cases involving sex offenders.
<P>	Most states that have such laws leave their application to the discretion of law 
enforcement officers. Often police departments get to decide which sex offenders 
constitute a threat to their neighbors. Although the state of Washington allows police to 
release photographs of and information about convicted sex offenders to community 
groups, and news outlets, the law is not always used. In the first 10 months of 1994, for 
instance, county police in Spokane notified the public only once of a paroled sex 
offender, though several were released into the area. Carol Dorris, who follows crime 
legislation for the National Victim's Center, says it is not unusual to see effective laws 
passed, then ignored. "It's fine to put in statutes and legislate something," she says, "but 
to enforce them is a lot harder to do."</P>
<P>	Nevertheless, recent developments show that concerned citizens have several 
outlets for civic action:</P>
<H3>Legislative Action</H3>
<P> The inability of probation officers to effectively track offenders 
argues for comprehensive notification laws--let the community provide the surveillance 
that the state cannot or will not. So far, such laws exist only in theory. For fear of 
destroying an ex-con's chances of success after release, no state has passed laws that 
would give the public the names and addresses of all parolees and probationers.</P>
<P>	Louisiana, however, has taken the lead in warning communities about released 
sex offenders. In 1992, the legislature passed two laws that ensure sex offenders will 
never again live anonymously in Louisiana. Or, as a later revision to the laws put it, 
"Persons found to have committed a sex offense have a reduced expectation of privacy." 
In fact, a person convicted of one of the state's 18 sex offenses can expect practically no 
privacy at all.</P>
<P>	The two laws and their amendments are vast in scope. No later than 10 days 
before a sex offender gets out of prison, corrections officials must send letters warning of 
his impending release to his victims, witnesses who testified against him, and the sheriff 
of the parish (county) to which he is going. Once he gets out, a sex offender must register 
with the sheriff and provide his fingerprints, his photograph, his social-security number, 
and any aliases he has used. The ex-con must also give the sheriff a description of his 
offense, including the date and place he committed it, and his home address. Offenders 
who move within the state of Louisiana have 10 days to re-register. The process 
continues for 10 years after their release.</P>
<P>	If his victim was a juvenile at the time of the offense, the offender must notify his 
neighbors as well. Twice within his first month out of prison, he must purchase an 
advertisement in his local newspaper. The ads must reveal his name, his address, and his 
offense. Descriptions of the crimes must be written in language ordinary citizens can 
understand; statute numbers do not suffice. To verify that it meets these specifications, 
the ad must pass muster with a parole officer.</P>
<P>	One such classified advertisement, which appeared in the <I>New Orleans Times-
Picayune</I> on May 8, 1994, is typical of the genre. "John Jones of 701 Teche St.," it said, 
"was convicted of a Sex Offense, Simple Rape." Another, on June 10, 1994, advertised, 
"I, Jim Davis, was convicted of molestation of a juvenile." [<I>Policy Review</I> has changed 
the names.] Other ads placed in the paper in June mentioned carnal knowledge, sexual 
battery, and indecent behavior with a juvenile.</P>
<P>	Once he has notified the larger community of his crime, an offender must tell his 
neighbors about it. The parolee must send letters or postcards with the same 
information--name, address, and offense--to every house within three blocks of his 
home. In cities, this usually means 36 square blocks and hundreds of houses. A parolee 
who lives in a rural area must send letters to everyone within a one-mile radius of his 
house.</P>
<P>	Finally, a sex offender whose victim was under 18 must contact the 
superintendent of the public-school district in his parish, as well as the principals of any 
private or parochial schools in the area.</P>
<P> 	If it chooses, a parole board also "may order any other form of notice which it 
deems appropriate, including but not limited to signs, handbills, bumper stickers, or 
clothing labeled to that effect." All of the expenses involved in the notification, such as 
stamps, envelopes, and advertising fees--not to mention any specially-labeled clothing 
the parole board may require--must be borne by the parolee. If at any time he fails to 
meet any requirement, an offender may be returned to prison.</P>
<H3>Citizen Journalists</H3>
<P>When John Roger, president of the Bayview Civic League in 
Norfolk, Virginia, asked the local police department to release the names of parolees who 
had moved into his neighborhood, it refused. Undeterred, Roger sought information at the 
other end of the criminal justice system: arrestees.</P>
<P>	Unlike the addresses of released felons, arrest records are publicly available from 
the police department. Every month, the league's newsletter, <I>Bayview Bylines</I>, publishes 
the name, race, and home address of each person taken into custody by the police within 
the boundaries of the Bayview neighborhood. Periodically, in a feature called "Pervert 
Alert," Roger also provides descriptions of flashers, peeping Toms, and other unsavory 
characters seen in the area. To pay for printing, local merchants buy advertising space in 
the newsletter. "Want to know why we do it?" he asks. "It's simple. We live here. We 
believe our members have a right to know what's going on."</P>
<P>	Though he prints only 4,000 copies of the newsletters, Roger is confident they 
reach many more people. Residents read it, he says, not only out of a fear of crime, but to 
"find if somebody they know has been arrested." The publicity can have consequences. 
Landlords, says Roger, scan the names of arrestees. "If it happens to be one of their 
tenants, they get rid of him."</P>
<P>	Although it remains difficult in most states to learn the whereabouts of parolees, 
there are other ways citizens can gather information on potentially dangerous criminals. 
In July 1994, John Johansen, a financial consultant in Arlington, Virginia, published the 
first issue of <I>Crime Prevention Bulletin</I>, a quarterly newspaper with a circulation of 
30,000. Police departments in Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland and Virginia 
cooperated with Johansen, giving him the photographs and last known addresses of 
fugitives in the area. Johansen printed the mug shots, some beneath headlines like 
"Wanted for Murder." The papers were distributed throughout the area by members of 
neighborhood organizations.</P>
<P>	The Bulletin was an instant success. In many cases, fugitives were still living in 
the same areas, even at the same addresses, amid neighbors who had no idea they were 
wanted by the law. Local police did not have the resources to track down each of the 
fugitives. But they could respond to tips provided by citizens who recognized their 
neighbors in the <I>Bulletin</I>. In its first six months, police credited Johansen's newspaper 
with the arrests of 15 fugitives in Washington alone. Six of them were suspected 
murderers.</P>
<H3>Do-It-Yourself Advertising</H3>
<P> Sanford "Sandy" Krasnoff, the president of Victims and 
Citizens Against Crime, in Lousiana, says his group devotes much of its energy to 
making certain the state's sex-crimes laws achieve their desired effect. Every Saturday 
morning, the flamboyant Krasnoff, who at various times in his career has been a New 
Orleans cop, a lawyer, and a manager of professional prize fighters, hosts a radio show 
called "Crime Watch." Each week, during three hours of air-time donated by the station, 
Krasnoff announces the names, addresses, and crimes of all sex offenders released on 
parole or probation in Louisiana in the previous week. Krasnoff gets the information 
directly from the parole and pardons board.</P>
<P>	Krasnoff's group also monitors offenders after their release. A volunteer, whom 
Krasnoff refers to as "the sex lady," scans newspapers for advertisements placed by 
parolees under the new law. When he saw that some of the ads were "coming out in 
mumbo-jumbo, referring to act numbers and statutes instead of telling people exactly 
what they were charged with," Krasnoff wrote a letter to the department of corrections, 
which promptly instructed parole officers to reject such ads.</P>
<P>	According to William T. Price, the deputy director of the state's adult probation 
and parole division, the state's new sex-offender laws have not prompted violence from 
the public. In a few cases, people moved upon learning that a child molester had come to 
their neighborhood. But, he says, nobody has yet thrown a fire bomb.</P>
<P>	Price does worry that the laws may be too broad, covering not only child 
molestation and forcible rape, but also non-predatory crimes like bigamy. "If you can 
attach the concept of sex to it," says Price, a crime probably falls under the rubric of the 
new laws.</P>
<P>	For all its willingness to publicize the names and addresses of sex offenders, the 
state of Louisiana still guards information about other parolees carefully. Apart from sex 
criminals, the state's probation and parole division refuses to give out the home addresses 
of the convicts it supervises. The concern, says Price, is that some people, such as bill 
collectors, could put the information to unwholesome purposes. "We don't want to get 
into that business," he says.</P>
<P>	In the fall of 1994, residents of Warwick, Rhode Island, a Providence suburbwere 
desperate to publicize the whereabouts of a man named Craig Price. Five years before, 
Price had admitted stabbing to death four of his Warwick neighbors. Because he was 
technically a juvenile when he committed the murders, he was sentenced to a juvenile 
detention center until age 21. Incensed by Price's crime, a Warwick police captain named 
Kevin Collins organized citizens to fight his release. "This guy had butchered four 
people," says Collins, "knowing that when he gets out at 21, he can go out and obtain a 
gun, [or] work in a day-care center."</P>
<P>	Collins decided to keep Craig Price from ever becoming anonymous. He 
recounted Price's story on radio and television shows. He sent press releases to papers 
around the country. When he heard that Price planned to move to Florida upon release, 
Collins hired an airplane to tow a sign over Miami Beach. The banner read, "Killer of 4 
Craig Price Moving Here? No Police Record!" Similar messages floated over Chicago 
and beaches in Los Angeles and New Jersey.</P>
<P>	Once Price is released, Collins says, he will not be able to tell the public where the 
killer lives. "Once he gets out there--like if he moves into your neighborhood," says 
Collins, "if I went around there knocking on doors, I think they're going to come after me 
on a civil-rights violation." Collins says the memory of the man's crimes may be enough 
to keep Price from killing again in Rhode Island. "Hey, my attitude is, he deserves to be a 
prisoner of public opinion."</P>
<H3>Exercising the Right to Know</H3>
<P> Although no Rhode Island statute would prevent Collins 
from publicizing Craig Price's address once the killer is released, doing so would be 
unwise. As a police officer, Collins could wind up in federal court under Title VII of the 
United States Code. Passed in 1964 as part of Lyndon Johnson's civil-rights legislation, 
the law allows individuals to bring civil action against government officials who conspire 
to deprive them of rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Courts have interpreted the 
law liberally, and it is conceivable that Collins could be found to have violated Price's 
right to privacy, a protection some judges believe emanates from the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>	The state's privacy act prohibits government officials from releasing a parolee's 
medical records, or information about his drug or alcohol treatment. But no regulations 
prohibit the state from giving out his home address to citizens who ask. The privacy law 
does not bind Rhode Islanders who do not work for the government. Says James Jerue, 
chairman of the state's parole board, if Craig Price were released on parole in Rhode 
Island, any citizen could find out where he lived. Not that Jerue thinks citizens would try 
to learn. "It has never happened," he says. "No one has ever asked for a home address."</P>
<P>	Citizens have a right to know when potentially dangerous criminals are released 
into their neighborhoods. But they also have an obligation to make the effort required to 
find the information. And there are many ways to get it.</P>
<UL><LI>  In places like Rhode Island, citizens can simply ask the state for the names and 
addresses of parolees.
<LI>In states with strict privacy laws, such as New York, citizens can lobby the legislature 
for legal reform.
<LI>Individuals can ask newspapers to publish the results of every parole hearing in the 
state, as well as the names of every person arrested and convicted for a serious crime. 
Once such information becomes public, it can be spread to a wider audience on 
community bulletin boards and computer services.
<LI>Citizens' groups can apply political pressure to police departments to release the names 
and addresses of those arrested and of those being released from prison into the area.
<LI>  No citizens' group should underestimate the power of a well-placed news story to make 
police departments more accommodating to its requests. If public scrutiny helps to keep 
criminals honest, it can have the same effect on public officials.</UL>
<P>	More than anything, concerned citizens must be willing to spend time and energy 
gathering information on known criminals. Which means they must be nosy. An informed 
community is not necessarily the most private, but it will be the safest.</P>

<H3> A Felon's Perspective (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	It is clear that social-service providers cannot supply all the supervision many ex-
cons need to stay out of trouble. Neighbors can help. Lewis, a 29-year-old native of 
Washington, D.C., has spent a large portion of his life as a professional burglar. Like 
many current and former criminals, he understands that it is vital to know whether 
neighbors have criminal pasts. "People got to know," Lewis says. "If you don't know 
who's living around you, you're trusting everybody. Most of the people that I know, 
including myself, we want everybody to trust us, because once you get trusted you can do 
basically anything you want to do."</P> 
<P>	As a young man, Lewis broke into houses on his own street. Had the neighbors 
known about his criminal tendencies, he says, "it would have never happened, because 
they would have been better prepared. You'd be surprised at the people who leave 
windows open and go to work. Some people are even stupid enough to get drunk around 
you and leave their keys."</P>
<P>	At 17, Lewis was arrested for several burglaries. He was convicted and sent to 
Lorton prison, outside of Washington, first to the juvenile wing, then to the adult facility. 
By the time he got out on parole, three years later, he had not been reformed, but he had 
become considerably wiser: He stopped breaking into his neighbors' houses. "Quite a 
few neighbors" knew about his burglary convictions, he says. "Basically, it was a `we're 
going to wait and see' type of thing. I was watched and that discouraged me from 
anything."</P>
<P>	Instead, Lewis says, he looked in other neighborhoods, especially crowded parts 
of town where neighbors would not recognize him. And he always went on foot. "You 
never drive a different car to a neighborhood because everybody notices it. If people see 
that different car, they'll wait `til you get out of it." Lewis estimates he burgled nearly 50 
houses before being sent back to prison (on drug-dealing charges, not burglary).</P>
<P>	It has been several years since Lewis finished his last term in prison. He is 
married and lives in Prince George's County, Maryland. He says he has no regular job, 
but works on and off for a temporary agency. His current neighbors do not know about 
his burglary convictions, and sometimes Lewis is tempted to steal again. "The urge will 
hit when I'm broke," he says. "Sometimes when it gets a little tight with money and she 
starts bitching, you start thinking what you can do for money. And you think, `I could 
always do what I used to do.' "</P>
<P>	Although Lewis has chosen not to tell his neighbors about his criminal past, he 
does not believe other criminals should have the same choice. "Why not alert people to 
the fact that you got a known criminal in the neighborhood, you got a burglar living next 
door to you?" he asks. "The burglar who lives next door to you will get you sooner than 
you think, especially if you don't know, because he can see you every day, he sees your 
moves every day."</P>

<H3>States Take Action (sidebar)</H3>

<P>Some states require notification of local police when a released convict moves into town, 
including:</P>
<B>Alabama</B>--Those convicted of two or more felonies must register with the town sheriff 
within 24 hours of moving to a new address.</BR>
<B>Florida and Mississippi</B>--All convicted felons must register with the town sheriff within 
24 hours of moving to a new address.<BR>
<B>Minnesota</B>--Only those convicted of certain crimes must register, such as murder and 
child molestation.</BR>
<B>Missouri and Tennessee</B>--Only those on parole need register.<BR>
<B>Nevada</B>--All felons who stay for more than 48 hours must register with the police, as 
must all visiting ex-cons who come to the state five or more times within 30 days.
In a number of other states, community-notification laws apply only to sex offenders. Though 
provisions of last year's federal anti-crime legislation may ultimately require all those 
convicted of sex crimes to register with state authorities, so far only some states keep 
track of sex offenders. They include:<BR>
<B>Arkansas</B>--The staff of a facility that is releasing a habitual child molester must send 
state police the offender's new address.<BR>
<B>California</B>--Citizens will soon be able to call a state-run 900 number to receive 
information about those convicted of child molestation.<BR>
<B>Connecticut</B>--Released sex offenders must register with state law enforcement.<BR>
<B>Delaware</B>--Police may announce a sex offender's release in a newspaper advertisement.<BR>
<B>Georgia</B>--As a condition of parole, chronic sex offenders must notify the sheriff in the 
town to which they move upon release from prison.<BR>
<B>Indiana</B>--Police departments must tell any citizen who asks the names of child molesters 
who live in his or her county.<BR> 
<B>New Jersey</B>--Sex offenders must notify the police of their home addresses every three 
months, and in some cases must continue doing so for life.<BR>
<B>Oregon</B>--When a child molester goes free, the department of corrections may alert 
police, churches, convenience stores, neighbors, businesses, or other places where minors 
congregate.</BR>
<B>Washington</B>--Police may post flyers giving the names, photographs, and addresses of  
chronic sex offenders.<BR>

Since its birth on Earth Day, 1970, the modern environmental movement can
claim many successes:  Air and water are cleaner; automobiles operate more
efficiently and pollute less; "smokestack" industries are more
environment-friendly than ever before.  

<P>
Perhaps more impressive than these tangible achievements is the impact the
environmental movement has had on American culture.  The vast majority of
Americans now think of themselves as "environmentalists," and most people
engage on a regular basis in some activity (e.g. recycling newspapers) that
allows them to act personally on their environmental beliefs.  The
environmental movement fundamentally changed American values on a scale
comparable to such great historical movements as Methodism and the American
suffrage movement.<p>

<h2>Hijacking the Broadcast Spectrum</h2><br>
<b>Opinion Editorial by 
Karen Kerrigan,
President
Small Business Survival Committee
&
Founder,
Campaign for Broadcast Competition</b>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Here is a story you won't see on network shows such as "60 Minutes," "Dateline," or
"Prime Time Live." <p>
America's network broadcasters are scurrying to preserve one of the greatest government giveaways in history.  In an era when telecommunications companies are paying the government for the use of our nation's airwaves, the broadcasters are on the verge of gaining additional spectrum for free.   A gift of taxpayer assets which, if auctioned, could raise more than $100 billion for federal debt reduction.  Even in Washington, that's a big number.<p>
This sweetheart deal will double the amount of spectrum each broadcaster currently
controls, and will allow them to offer new services such as two-way paging and wireless voice and data services, in addition to multiple channels of digital television.  It should cause considerable consternation to the telecommunication companies who have had to pay billions for their right to use the airwaves.<p>
The deal originated as part of the government's attempt in 1991 to develop an American version of High Definition Television (HDTV).  Experts were afraid that the Japanese would dominate the next generation of television technology and eliminate any American presence in the high-profile consumer electronics industry.  In a classical case of wrong-headed industrial policy, the FCC coordinated the technology development effort, and agreed to provide the broadcasters with additional spectrum to transmit the HDTV signal in order to create a market and make the transition from analog television.<p>
But a funny thing happened on the way to the market.  Technological gains made HDTV a technological dinosaur -- especially in the broadcaster's eyes.  They realized that they could provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves, making way for multiple television channels, while leaving space for other lucrative services.<p>
Given the market and technological realities, the broadcaster's reneged on their
commitment to deploy HDTV.  However, they still want the spectrum.  They argue that -- without the additional spectrum -- they will never be able to compete with the new players in television, such as cable and telephone companies.  This, despite a fifty year head start.  They also argue that paying for additional spectrum will sound the death knell for "free T.V." <p>     
This line of reasoning rings hollow, especially with a budget-focused and  market-oriented Congress.  For the past fifty years the broadcasters have profited handsomely from their current business;  there is certainly no need for the federal government to guarantee their future success as participants in a competitive communications environment.  It is also hard to feel sorry for an industry whose performance last year was the most profitable in history.  It is difficult to see this as the end of advertiser-supported television.<p>
A few Members of Congress and concerned citizens are finally raising this issue for what it really is -- a multi-billion dollar giveaway.  It is an insider deal that will come at the expense of others.  With increasing pressure to reduce the national debt, Congress cannot let this deal pass by unchallenged.<p>
More importantly, an extremely expensive and profoundly wrong presumption remains
untouched:  that the government should continue to be in the business of promoting certain technologies such as HDTV, or attempting to guarantee the success of an industry by shielding, for example, the broadcasters from competition.  Recent communications success stories such as direct broadcast television and cellular telephone service offer compelling evidence that the market remains the only effective vehicle for selecting industrial winners.<p>
The recent wireless auctions, where telecommunications companies bid $10 billion to
offer a new generation of cellular services, provide an effective model for allocating the public airwaves.  It would work beautifully in allocating spectrum now being offered free of charge.  Allow the broadcasters to keep their current, free licenses to use for broadcast television.  Put the new spectrum allocation up for auction.  And forget about foisting HDTV technology onto the American public -- if they want it, someone will figure out a way to offer it to them and make the necessary investment.<p>
     The current proposal reflects wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset.  At a time ofheightened awareness of our budget limitations, Congress should not be bullied into this giveaway.  Economics, not special-interest politics, should decide the allocation and uses of the spectrum.  In a competitive telecommunications environment, entrepreneurs will meet and create new demands.<p>
Allow the market to determine the value and use of this asset and let competition reign. It will pay great dividends to consumers, the economy and the Treasury.<p>

 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the
best technological decisions for the consumer, not government," added Kerrigan.

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
For Immediate Release<br>
July 31, 1995<br>
<p>
<center>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

TO:  Concerned Citizens<br>
FROM:  Small Business Survival Committee<br>
RE:  <i><b>Broadcast Spectrum Could Cost Taxpayers Billions</i></b><br>
DATE:  August 3, 1995
<p>
<hr>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is about to give away billions of dollars worth of public airwaves to television broadcasters free -- this after the broadcasters have already made billions on the free television licenses they already possess.  Under the current plan, the broadcasters will double their spectrum and can use it for anything they want from pay television to cellular phone service to paging -- all at the taxpayers' expense.  The spectrum should be auctioned, creating a competing broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and granting up to $100 billion to reduce the deficit. <p>
Last week, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on broadcasters to forge a "Contract for Kids and Community" to meet the public interest obligations they have already shirked.  Hundt's efforts to expand education programming and attain concrete commitments for broadcasters to help parents choose high quality, nonviolent programming are well-meaning.  But he has failed to connect the dots.  The broadcasters have proven in the past (and backed by public opinion surveys) that they
do not use their spectrum to further the public good.<p>
<h3>WHY AUCTIONS?</h3><p>
Since Congress decided in 1993 to stop giving the airways away free, telecommunications companies have bid over $10 billion in auctions to obtain spectrum to provide services.  Why are the broadcasters entitled to twice as much spectrum at no cost?  Shouldn't they compete along with everyone else for the rights to use the public's scarce spectrum?  Hasn't the government proven that it is lousy at picking "winners and losers" in the marketplace?  Competition makes the best decisions for consumers not the government.<p>
Broadcasters claim that auctioning the spectrum will mean the end to free television. 
Competition has benefited not only consumers, but the broadcasters!  What they fail to mention is that the broadcasters have just enjoyed their most profitable year in history. <p>
Apart from denying broadcasters corporate welfare they do not deserve, auctioning the spectrum will provide funds and flexibility to truly use the spectrum for public good.  Auction proceeds could be used to reduce the national debt and better yet, new innovative broadcast companies will provide the public with the quality programming they are demanding.<p>
<h3>ACT NOW</h3><p>
The National Association of Broadcasters is a very powerful lobby in Washington.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on record saying no one will take them on.  FCC Chair <a href="mail to:kidstv@fcc.gov"> Reed Hundt</a> (e-mail address: kidstv@fcc.gov) and <a href="mail to:georgia@hr.house.gov">Speaker Gingrich</a> (e-mail address: georgia@hr.house.gov) need to hear from concerned taxpayers who will not sit idly by while the powerful NAB seeks protection from market competition and robs American consumers of innovative services and costs taxpayers billions of dollars.<p>
The FCC is considering this issue now, and must hear from concerned citizens when possible. We suggest that you send a letter to Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Hundt to send them the message that the public hopes that not all of its officials share their fear of the broadcasters.<p>

<h3>Gift to TV Networks</h3>
<br>
To the Editor:<p>
Re "Media Mergers" (editorial, Aug. 2): Under pressure from the television networks,
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission will soon reward these
megacorporations with a multibillion-dollar deal to double their share of the airwaves free.  The broadcasters were to use this spectrum for the transition to high-definition television.  However, they are reneging on that deal -- to provide more "quality" television.  They will also use the airwaves for paging, and voice and data services.<p>
Recent auctions of public airwaves raised $10 billion to reduce the deficit; if these
companies paid billions, why shouldn't Disney, Group W and Rupert Murdoch?  The giveaway is valued at $10 billion to $100 billion.  Unless Congress reverses course, the taxpayer will pay.<p>

"The Heritage Foundation is without question the most far-reaching conservative 
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous 
impact not just in Washington but literally across the planet." - House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, R-GA.
<p>

<p>

When more than 300 Republican congressional candidates joined House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the steps of the Capitol for a Sept. 27 "photo 
op" - intended to focus national attention on the House GOP's "Contract with 
America" - liberal "spin doctors" warned that Gingrich & Company had gravely 
miscalculated.  Weeks later the voters delivered their own verdict: It was 
the spin doctors who had miscalculated.
<P>
The "Contract with America" drew heavily from years of Heritage Foundation 
research.  While not every detail of every proposal was identical to the recommendations 
made over the years by Heritage analysts in their congressional testimony, 
articles, books, and research papers, the similarities were striking.  Said 
the liberal Boston Globe: "As the leading source of scholarship for that [conservative] 
movement, The Heritage Foundation has been able to hammer home a simple message: 
Government programs have done more to worsen the nation's social problems than 
to heal them."          
<P>
Heritage welcomed the 1994 political season with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," a first-of-its-kind 
candidates' briefing book providing comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform. Newt 
Gingrich, who would become the new Speaker of the House in 1995, called the 
book, which was made available to every House and Senate candidate (and, on 
request, several gubernatorial candidates), an example of Heritage at its best: 
doing "serious work ... and thinking about not just how to get power, but how 
to use power for the nation's good." In the final weeks of the fall campaign, 
talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh read extensive excerpts from "Issues '94," which 
had become a primary reference source for dozens of campaigns. Many of these 
campaigns were successful. 
<P>

<P>

Following the conservative victory in November, Heritage was ready once again 
with a policy blueprint for the new 104th Congress. The 19-chapter "New Member's 
Guide to the Issues" - compared by some to Heritage's Reagan-era "Mandate for 
Leadership" series - offered concrete suggestions for a conservative reordering 
of Washington on issues as diverse as agriculture, the budget, crime, defense 
policy, education, regulation, taxation, and trade. The Guide served as the 
basic "textbook" at Heritage's freshman orientation program for new members 
of Congress, held in December in Baltimore. 
<P>


"Issues '94" and "The New Member's Guide to the Issues" were both collaborative 
efforts involving The Heritage Foundation's entire research staff.

<P>
If not dishonest, Washington's traditional misuse of numbers certainly is misleading. 
The use of a technical device known as "baseline budgeting" has enabled policy-makers 
for 20 years to claim spending reductions while increasing spending. Everything, 
it seems - from omnibus spending bills to the budget reconciliation process 
- has been intended to hide from the public the true cost of Washington's actions. 
Just what does a $260 billion tax increase mean to the average family or the 
typical community?
<P>


The Heritage Foundation can now provide the answers. Thanks to a major half-million-dollar 
technical upgrade of our computer-analysis capabilities, Heritage's Roe Institute 
for Economic Policy Studies can now provide - overnight, if necessary - the 
kind of "hard numbers" and statistical analysis that can change the course 
of debate. Over and over again in 1994 - on the crime bill, on the flood of 
health-care reform plans that threatened to overwhelm Capitol Hill, on the 
fiscal year 1995 budget - Heritage showed that its data-analysis capabilities 
now rival those of the Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management 
and Budget. But that's not all; as often as possible, Heritage analysts attempted 
to make the numbers understandable, showing how various policy proposals would 
impact individual businesses, workers, families, and the cities and states 
where they live.

Endowed by The Roe Foundation of Greenville, S.C., and other supporters, the 
Roe Institute staff specializes in budget and tax issues, the effects of regulation 
on the economy, environmental policy, competitiveness, and trade. Recommendations 
in 1994 included a call for a $500-per-child tax credit, repeal of the Social 
Security earnings tax, and reduction and indexation of the capital gains tax. 
The Roe Institute staff also identified numerous wasteful and inefficient government 
programs that should be cut back or eliminated and helped convince lawmakers 
of the merits of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). And, of 
course, they continued to argue persuasively for a balanced budget amendment 
to the Constitution, which became a major component of the House GOP's "Contract 
with America."

Heritage's popular prosperity plan for America, called "Putting Families First," 
served as the basis for the alternative budget offered by House and Senate 
Republicans in 1994. While the plan, written by <a href="/heritage/s
taff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Heritage's Grover 
M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs, fell short in the 103rd Congress, 
most of its components were included in the "Contract with America."  
<P>



<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>egulatory <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eform</H3></CENTER>

Roe Institute analysts also focused in 1994 on the regulatory burden placed 
on the economy, environmental policies that threaten private-property rights, 
and "unfunded mandates" - regulations the federal government imposes on businesses 
and state and local governments without paying for them. Among the most widely 
quoted studies published during the year was then Deputy Director Susan Eckerly's 
first-ever "Citizen's Guide to Regulation," which illustrated the real damage 
overzealous federal bureaucrats can do to the economy, businesses, and individuals.

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">H</FONT>ealth-<FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>are 
<FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eform</H3></CENTER>

The expertise built up over five years of intensive research, aided by new 
data-processing capabilities, enabled Heritage's health-policy experts, headed 
by <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart
Butler</a>, Vice President and Director, Domestic Policy Studies, and 
Deputy Director <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a>, to play a significant role in the defeat of 
government-controlled health care in 1994. After providing Congress and the 
media with a wealth of material showing why the Clinton health-care plan would 
be a disaster, the Heritage analysts produced more than a dozen papers during 
a three-week summer period analyzing in detail the many alternative plans that 
flooded the marketplace after the collapse of the Clinton plan. The result: 
Any hope of placing one-seventh of the U.S. economy under the control of the 
federal government vanished.
<P>
Meanwhile, Heritage continued to argue that the best way to reform health care 
is to de-link health insurance from the workplace so individuals can own their 
own health policies and have a direct stake in their cost. This idea was the 
model for the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, sponsored in the 103rd Congress 
by Sen. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL).

Even as Heritage Welfare and Family Issues Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> was exposing 
President Clinton's welfare-reform plan as another expansion of the welfare 
state, Cultural Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a> was helping focus the nation's 
attention on the connection between the startling rise in illegitimate births 
and other social pathologies, such as crime and failure in school. In both 
the House and Senate, 1994 saw the introduction of legislation based on Rector's 
research and recommendations. Many of these same ideas - such as banning increased 
benefits for unwed mothers under age 21 who have additional children, requiring 
welfare recipients to work for their benefits, and putting an overall cap on 
welfare spending - were included in the House GOP's "Contract with America."

Also in 1994, Heritage Distinguished Fellow in Cultural Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William 
Bennett</a>'s "Index of Leading Cultural Indicators" was updated, expanded, and 
published as a quality paperback by Touchstone Books, a division of Simon and 
Schuster. Americans now have at their fingertips the information they need 
to monitor long-term trends in America's social health. Bennett's "The Book 
of Virtues," meanwhile, remained on The New York Times bestseller list throughout 
the year.

"The Clinton administration does take national interests into account when 
formulating foreign policy. The trouble is, they are frequently the interests 
of other nations," Lawrence Di Rita, Deputy Director of Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies, told reporters in one of several well-attended briefings in 
1994. 
<P>

<p>
Heritage analysts throughout the year continued their efforts to bring needed 
clarity and focus to America's meandering foreign policy. The big picture was 
provided by the updated monograph, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," which went 
into a second printing in 1994. With more than 10,000 copies in print, the 
global blueprint is now used by more than two dozen universities and graduate 
schools, including America's war colleges, as a primer on foreign policy and 
national security. The book explains how U.S. national interests should be 
used to establish foreign policy goals, how to evaluate potential threats to 
those interests, and how to build and maintain the military forces needed to 
respond to potential threats.
<P>

<p>
Individual papers during the year examined the dangers of putting U.S. forces 
under foreign command as part of U.N. "peacekeeping" missions, warned of the 
danger of cutting too deeply into the U.S. defense budget, urged the United 
States not to abandon the idea of building missile defenses, and developed 
a strategy for revamping the U.S. foreign-aid program.

With the approval of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) shortly 
after Thanksgiving, Heritage's ongoing efforts to promote the global expansion 
of free trade reached another important milestone. The long march, however, 
is far from over: Of the 101 countries ranked on Heritage's "Index of Economic 
Freedom," released at year's end, just 25 had free or "mostly free" trading 
policies.
<P>


One of the main objectives of Heritage's two-year-old American Trader Initiative, 
a joint effort involving both the business and policy communities,  is the 
liberalization of the rules governing international commerce. The program is 
based on the belief not only that free trade furthers U.S. national interests 
by creating new business opportunities for American companies, but that economic 
freedom helps spawn political freedom as well. The long-term goal of the program 
is a free-trade area encompassing both the Western Hemisphere and Pacific Rim. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to their work on the GATT agreement, Heritage trade experts pushed 
the administration to make trade liberalization the centerpiece of two important 
1994 summit meetings: the November meeting in Indonesia of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the December '94 "Summit of the Americas" 
in Miami. In both cases, the United States and its trading partners agreed 
to phase out all trade barriers - by the year 2005 in the Americas and by the 
year 2020 in the Asia-Pacific region.

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">I</FONT>ndex of <FONT SIZE = "+2">E</FONT>conomic

Just one day after The Heritage Foundation released its first-ever global report 
card on economic freedom, Sen. Mitch McConnell 
(R-KY), incoming Chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations 
Subcommittee, suggested major changes in America's $14 billion-per-year foreign 
aid program. As Heritage Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and 
Defense Studies Kim Holmes told reporters at a Dec. 16 media briefing, most 
U.S. development aid is being given to countries "that don't deserve it" because 
their state-controlled economies will waste it. Countries with free economies, 
he noted, generally don't need U.S. aid. 
<P>


<P>
Earlier in the week, Holmes had said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed page article 
that "People in Angola, Haiti, Mozambique and Ukraine are not poor because 
wealthy people in the West haven't been generous toward them." They are poor, 
he said, because their governments' "misguided economic policies" retard economic 
growth and prosperity.
<P>

<P>

This long-overdue debate over U.S. foreign-aid policy was precipitated  by 
the publication of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 258-page comparative 

analysis compiled by Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a> and Thomas Sheehy.  Released on Dec. 12, the "Index" examines the economies of 101 countries. As Investor's 
Business Daily noted, Heritage created the "Index," which is similar to Freedom 
House's annual country-by-country survey of political freedom, "to help U.S. 
and international policy-makers better craft their aid policies. If aid money 
is given to a country that is following poor economic policies, the chances 
are good it will be wasted or do little, if any, good."

 

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>sian <FONT SIZE = "+2">S</FONT>tudies 
<FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>enter</H3></CENTER>

Not surprisingly, four of the ten countries with the best ratings on Heritage's 
"Index of Economic Freedom" - and eight of the top 20 - were from the Asia-Pacific 
region. When the United States, Canada, and Chile are included - all of which 
belong to the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) - the 
more broadly defined region boasts 11 of the 20 freest economies in the world. 
The APEC nations also now account for 40 percent of all global trade.
<P>

<P>

In recognition of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific community, The 
Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center was established in 1983. Today, 
the Center is recognized on both sides of the Pacific as one of the most important 
research and policy centers on diplomatic, economic, and security issues affecting 
the United States and Asia.
<P>
While trade and security issues dominated the calendar, Director <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a> 
and the Asian Studies Center staff made a strong case in 1994 for significantly 
upgrading U.S. relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan, a booming country 
of more than 20 million people that continues to be treated as a second-class 
world citizen by the United States. Visiting Fellow Daryl Plunk and Richard 
V. Allen, National Security Advisor to President Reagan and Chairman of the 
Asian Studies Center's Advisory Council, provided Washington with much-needed 
guidance on defusing the growing crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons 
program. And Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a> offered the White House an agenda 
for the mid-November APEC summit, proposing that leaders of the 18 member countries 
set a "time certain" for establishing a trans-Pacific free-trade area, the 
topic of an Oct. 27 Asian Studies Center conference featuring Nancy Adams, 
U.S. Trade Representative for APEC Affairs, and Paula Stern, former Chairwoman 
of the U.S. International Trade Commission.   
<P>

<P>

The Heritage-sponsored Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) 
hosted several "newsmaker" breakfasts during the year. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-SC), 
then ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, discussed the 
North Korean nuclear threat. Political analysts Victor Kamber, a liberal Democrat, 
 and Bradley O'Leary, a conservative Republican, discussed the congressional 
elections. And Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> discussed "The Index of Economic Freedom" 
and proposed changes in U.S. foreign aid policy. 
<P>
Important financial support for many of the Asian Studies Center's programs 
continues to be provided by the Korea Foundation Endowment for Korean Studies.

Russian political scientist Evgueni Volk was appointed coordinator of the Heritage 
Foundation's Moscow Office in 1994, succeeding Senior Fellow Jeffrey Gayner, 
who had directed the office since its opening in 1993. 
<P>
Heritage's Moscow office is now seen in Russia as a neutral meeting ground 
where reformers can work out their public differences in private. This is done 
through the Heritage Reform Forum, a monthly "summit" meeting of Moscow's leading 
reform politicians, businessmen, and journalists.    
<P>
The Moscow Office also is involved in more traditional policy analysis. Volk 
and Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies Ariel Cohen distribute 
draft legislation being considered by the Russian parliament to experts in 
the United States, Europe, and Russia. Comments and suggestions are then sent 
to members of the parliament and appropriate staff. During 1994, legislation 
on defense, "peacekeeping" operations, lobbying, and non-governmental organizations 
was refined in this way.

<p>
On April 27, Heritage Vice President for Educational Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a> 
was a guest lecturer at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
 According to former Congressman Mickey Edwards, who had organized the curriculum, 
Meyerson's class was rated by the students as one of the course's highlights. 
        
<p>
Though many in the academic community remain openly hostile to conservative 
ideas, The Heritage Foundation's academic outreach programs are attempting 
to break the left's hold on academia. Activities include the Bradley Scholars 
Program, Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership, Resource Bank, and Lectures 
and Seminars.
<p>

<p>
The Bradley Scholars Program, made possible by a grant from the Lynde and Harry 
Bradley Foundation of Milwaukee, welcomed its eighth class to Washington in 
September: crime reporter <a href="/heritage/staff/carlson.htm">Tucker Carlson</a>, a former Policy Review Assistant 
Editor, who rejoined Heritage after a year as an editorial writer for the Democrat-Gazette 
in Little Rock; <a href="/heritage/staff/toler.htm">Herbert H. Toler, Jr.</a>, an expert on the black church in America, 
who joined Heritage from Union Theological Seminary and Howard University; 
and <a href="/heritage/staff/hood.htm">John Hood</a>, Vice President of the John Locke Foundation, Raleigh, N.C., 
a prominent state think tank.
<p>
The Bradley Scholars Program provides writers and academics with a venue in 
Washington for conducting long-term research and writing projects geared to 
current public policy issues.

<p>
Forty college and university faculty members and advanced graduate students 
were named Heritage Foundation Salvatori Fellows in 1994.
<p>

Focus of the Salvatori Center's Annual Conference for Academic Leadership, 
held May 11-12, was "The Constitution of Ordered Liberty: Academic Questions 
for the 21st Century."  More than 100 scholars, academic administrators, and 
journalists attended the conference. The annual Salvatori Awards for Academic 
Excellence were presented to Henry Manne, George Mason University School of 
Law, Fairfax, VA, and Edward Banfield, Harvard University.
<p>
Heritage's Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership was established in 1991 
to encourage academic excellence and stimulate the study and discussion in 
higher education of the ideas and principles that form the foundations of America's 
political and cultural traditions. Salvatori Center programs are made possible 
by a grant from the Henry Salvatori Foundation of Los Angeles.

The "networking" arm of Heritage's Educational Affairs program, the <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> is a cooperative exchange program involving more than 2,000 university 
professors, academic research centers, educational foundations, and policy 
groups in the United States and abroad. The purpose of the Resource Bank, which 
was established in 1977, is to help conservative scholars and policy specialists 
participate more fully in the policy-making process.
<p>

Some 300 Resource Bank members from a record 130 organizations attended the 
17th Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago in April. The theme of the two-day 
conference was "Restoring the American Community: The `New Citizenship' at 
Work," a phrase coined by Bradley Foundation President Michael Joyce to describe 
the rebirth of grassroots activism around the country.  The program highlighted 
the efforts of volunteers, activists, entrepreneurs, and citizen-legislators.
<p>
The Resource Bank's working groups focused in 1994 on state issues, public 
interest law, unfunded federal mandates, family issues, and foreign and defense 
policy issues.

<p>
What do film critic Michael Medved, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jeremy 
Boorda, Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and the Ambassadors 
of Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico have in common? They all spoke at 
The Heritage Foundation last fall, all in the same week. Their presentations 
were overshadowed that week by another Heritage speaker: California Gov. Pete 
Wilson, whose denunciation of costly federal mandates made headline news around 
the country and was broadcast repeatedly by SPAN, the Cable-Satellite Public 
Affairs Network.
<p>

<P>
The Heritage Foundation in 1994 remained one of Washington's leading forums. 
Thousands attended the more than 100 public lectures and seminars, and millions 
more watched the proceedings on public-affairs television or read the published 
lectures.
<p>
<B>Among 1994's notable events:</B>
<p>
 The inauguration of a 10-part lecture series, "Sweet Land of Liberty: Strengthening 
America's Culture," sponsored by the Salvatori Foundation. 
<p>
 The Ambassadors Forum on Free Trade, a panel discussion with the four previously 
mentioned ambassadors, held just weeks before the "Summit of the Americas."
<p>
 A major conference on reforming the U.S. agricultural system, featuring three 
former Secretaries of Agriculture: John Block, Earl Butz, and Clayton Yeutter.
<p>
In addition to several governors and numerous members of the House and Senate, 
featured speakers during the year included Heritage Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William 
Bennett</a>; Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative; William Kristol, Chairman 
of the Project for the Republican Future; G. Gordon Liddy, the popular radio 
talk-show host; Gen. Merrill McPeak, the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff; Gen. 
Gordon Sullivan, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff; Cal Thomas, the popular author, 
columnist, and television talk-show host; and Robert Woodson, President of 
the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - President's Message -- Heritage</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2><I><FONT SIZE = "+3">P</FONT>resident's <FONT SIZE = "+3">M</FONT>essage</I></H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Wow, What a Year!</B></CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
Early on the morning of November 9, 1994, as I sat contemplating the "tsunami," 
or shock wave, that the national elections had unleashed on official Washington, 
I noticed a copy of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>" in my bookcase, a book which Heritage 
published in 1988.
<P>
In the Foreword to that book, a young Georgia Congressman wrote, "Every citizen 
should be concerned about the arrogance and corruption of the present day Congress. 
 At stake is the liberty of the American public. must reform Congress to make 
it truly representative once again."
<P>
Newt Gingrich had it right. And on Nov. 8, millions of Americans expressed 
that concern at the ballot box by sending to Washington and the statehouses 
and legislatures of America an army of lawmakers dedicated to reforming Congress 
and finishing the conservative revolution Ronald Reagan began in 1980.
<P>
The following week, at the largest President's Club meeting in Heritage's history, 
that same Georgia Congressman gave one of his first public addresses as the 
future Speaker of  the U.S. House of Representatives - the first Republican 
speaker in 40 years. "Heritage," Gingrich said, "is without question the most 
far-reaching conservative organization in the country in the war of  ideas, 
and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally 
across the planet."
<P>

California Gov. Pete Wilson, three days later, also visited us at Heritage, 
giving a major national address on the ways in which liberalism had distorted 
the relationship between the state and federal governments. Governor Wilson, 
who had spoken earlier in the year at a meeting of our Governors' Forum,  described 
Heritage "as an island of clear thinking and common sense amid the fuzzy-headed 
liberalism of Washington.  Here at Heritage you have long been champions of 
the idea of limited government in order to expand individual opportunity, an 
idea that was at the heart of last week's ballot box rebellion."
<P>
The impact of all this really hit home a week later when Harvard's Kennedy 
School of Government canceled the orientation program it had been holding for 
newly elected members of Congress since 1972. The reason?  Lack of interest: 
Most members of Congress's Class of 1994 had decided to attend the Heritage 
Foundation/Empower America orientation conference. As Harvard's hometown newspaper, 
the liberal Boston Globe, said in a major article, "In the capricious business 
of supplying politicians with academic expertise and advice, if Harvard's star 
is fading, The Heritage Foundation's is surely on the ascent."
<P>

<p>
What a month November was. What a year!

<P>
The important thing to remember is that all of this didn't just happen.  Just 
as Heritage drew up the battle plan for the first conservative insurgency against 
Washington's liberal fortress with our "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/mnd2.html">Mandate for Leadership</a>" series, we 
also have had a major role in fashioning the new conservative agenda.  Heritage 
welcomed 1994 with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," first-of-its-kind briefing book for congressional 
candidates. "Issues '94" provided comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform.
<P>
Later in the year our analysts were asked for their input on the House GOP 
leadership's proposal to do the unthinkable: tell the American voters where 
they stand on the important issues of the day. The result was the "Contract 
with America." 
<P>
This was followed by still another major set of recommendations for the the 
conservative 104th Congress, "The New Member's Guide to the Issues."
<P>
As New York's Village Voice, one of the bellwethers of counterculture liberalism, 
said of the new conservative agenda: "The driving force behind this conservative 
program is the Heritage Foundation, which over the last decade has occupied 
center stage as the preeminent think tank in Washington .... Heritage was the 
architect of the attack on the New Deal Congress, and has been an important 
force in developing the assault on the liberal-minded federal civil service, 
the drive for privatization, and the overall philosophy of free market economics."
<P>

<P>
All of this was accomplished as the men and women of Heritage went about a 
range of activities that made 1994 the single most productive year in our 21-year 
history. We developed "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," which already is redefining 
the U.S. foreign aid debate; produced a comprehensive tax-relief and deficit-reduction 
plan, "Putting Families First," which became the official alternative budget 
of congressional Republicans in 1994; provided much of the intellectual ammunition 
that led to the demise of health-care "reforms" that would have put the federal 
government in charge of the trillion-dollar U.S. health-care system; played 
a major role in the GATT debate; exposed the crime bill as little more than 
another pork-laden social-spending bill; crafted a welfare reform plan that 
would truly "end welfare as we know it"; began work on a major study of agriculture 
policy, with publication timed for the 1995 debate on the farm bill; and launched 
a new institution-wide program, the American Trader Initiative, to push for 
a liberalized trade policy that dramatically increases international business 
opportunities.          
<P>

Clearly, 1994 was a banner year in terms of  policy development. But there 
was much more:
<P>
... Heritage military analysts, in a series of studies examining the administration's 
defense budget, found that the administration had underfunded its own defense 
plan more than $100 billion over five years.
<P>
... Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a>, one of the country's leading voices 
on cultural policy and a  featured speaker at our April Board Meeting & Public 
Policy Seminar, saw his "The Book of Virtues" stay at the top of the national 
bestseller lists. Touchstone Books, meanwhile, published an expanded and updated 
version of Bennett's landmark Heritage study, "The Index of Leading Cultural 
Indicators." 
<P>
... A seminal study by Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, chronicling 
the terrible consequences to children and society of out-of-wedlock births, 
sent shockwaves across the country, adding a new sense of urgency to the continuing 
debate over welfare reform.
<P>
... We also released the second edition of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," 
which remains the only comprehensive conservative blueprint for post-Cold War 
foreign and defense policy.
<P>
... The Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) was re-established 
under Heritage's sponsorship; and
<P>
... A record 130 organizations joined us at Heritage's 17th Annual <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> Meeting.
<P>
Major advances in our computer capabilities, meanwhile, provided Heritage analysts 
with a powerful new analytical tool rivaling that of the government itself. 
For example: Using our computer model, Heritage analysts were able to measure 
the impact of health-care proposals on businesses, workers, families, and the 
states.
<P>
In addition to the vastly expanded computer capabilities, we also upgraded 
our radio broadcast facilities, enabling talk show hosts to air their programs 
live from Heritage's studios on Capitol Hill. And our magazine, <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, 
continued to grow, reaching another circulation milestone - 30,000. As Boston 
Globe columnist David Warsh wrote, "No magazine has been more vivid in conveying 
the cultural breadth and depth of the conservative imagination."
<P>
These are just a few of the highlights from an incredibly productive, whirlwind 
year. Heritage also remained one of Washington's leading policy forums, with 
dozens of  lectures, seminars, and debates filling our Lehrman Auditorium and 
Van Andel Conference Center. 


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>eople <FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>re <FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>olicy</CENTER></H3>
<P>
As you know, when The Heritage Foundation was first established in 1973 we 
made a conscious decision to be different from Washington's other "think tanks." 
 Our goal - then, as now - was to have an impact on the national public policy 
debate, not just publish research papers and host conferences. To do this, 
we identified target markets in the Congress, the administration, and the news 
media and then designed our research product to meet the needs of the marketplace. 

<P>
Today we are a permanent Washington institution. But we still pride ourselves 
on our originality and inventiveness; on steering the debate, not just responding 
to it. 
<P>
What enables us to do this?  Our people - who are among the chief intellectual 
resources of Washington's new conservative establishment.
<P>
During 1994, we made several important changes in our management team. <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew 
Gayner</a> was named Vice President for External Relations and will oversee Heritage's 
outreach to the business community, conservative policy organizations, and 
the nation's governors. <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a>, a former Defense Department official 
and a Japan specialist, was named Director of our Asian Studies Center. Bridget 
Wagner, a 13-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of Business Relations. 
And Margaret Bonilla, a seven-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of 
Development.
<P>
Notable staff additions included <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, who was named 
Senior Policy Analyst, and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, who joined us as Senior Fellow in 
Statistical Policy Analysis.  
<P>
With sadness we note the passing of three giants of the conservative movement: 
Dr. Russell Kirk, a long-time Heritage Distinguished Scholar, lecturer, critic, 
conscience of the conservative movement, and author of dozens of books,  including 
"The Conservative Mind"; Dr. Walter Judd, conservative leader, American patriot, 
recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a dedicated member of The 
Heritage Foundation; and Shelby Cullom Davis, the New York investment banker 
and former Ambassador to Switzerland who served with great distinction as Heritage's 
long-time Board Chairman. The memory of these three great Americans will live 
on at Heritage, as will the impact they had on America and the world.
<P>
While we continue to take great pride in our work, we realize that it is possible 
only because of the continued generous support of our donors. We thank them, 
sincerely. In 1994, income topped $25.5 million, most of it coming from the 
200,000 individuals, foundations, and businesses that comprise the Heritage 
family.
<P>


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>he <FONT SIZE = "+2>F</FONT>uture</H3></CENTER>
<P>
What about 1995 and beyond? Conservatives have spent the past 20 years building 
a broad network of institutions dedicated to common-sense government  - think 
tanks, state-based research organizations, public interest law groups, radio 
talk shows, on-line computer networks, even a conservative television network 
(soon to be joined by one or more others).  With these institutions solidly 
in place we got our message out. It was heard and understood. 
<P>
Heritage will play a very active role in shaping the new Washington. Our agenda 
 includes reductions in taxes and federal spending - including the elimination 
of several government departments, agencies, programs, and functions - welfare 
and entitlement reform, a revival of federalism, de-regulation of the economy, 
restoring defense readiness, protecting the United States against possible 
missile attack, stopping the spread of global terrorism, and re-examining U.S. 
foreign aid. 
<P>
We are starting an exciting journey that should result in a major change in 
the relationship between the American people and their government. All of us 
at Heritage look forward to being a part of this promising new chapter in American 
history.

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - Membership -- Heritage</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2><I><FONT SIZE = "+3">M</FONT>embership</I></H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>America's Most Broadly Supported Think Tank</B></CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/mbrship.html">Join the Heritage
Foundation!</a>
<p>
The Heritage Foundation received another vote of confidence from its members 
and donors in 1994:  For the 21st consecutive year, income from contributions 
was up - to an all-time record of $21.5 million - as was Heritage's influence 
and impact.
<p>
With more than 200,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters, The 
Heritage Foundation remains the most broadly supported research institute in 
the United States. Of the $25.5 million in total income - a 12 percent increase 
over 1993 ($22.9 million) - 50 percent was provided by individuals, 25 percent 
by foundations, and 9 percent by business contributors.
<P>
But Heritage members and supporters do more than write checks: They receive 
Heritage publications, attend meetings, visit with Heritage representatives, 
and learn about the issues of the day. Heritage's members fuel the institution's 
success in two ways: They provide the financial resources needed for Heritage 
to do its job in Washington, and many of them take the knowledge they gain 
through their personal involvement with Heritage back to their local communities.
<P>


Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has made it a firm policy to accept no 
government funding, perform no contract work, and maintain no political or 
academic affiliations. All contributions are voluntary and tax deductible under 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This enables Heritage to maintain 
its independence; it also means that Heritage's officers and staff must earn 
the trust of members and supporters each year.
<P>

Most Heritage donors are motivated by two things: They agree with the conservative 
principles upon which Heritage's work is based, and they believe The Heritage 
Foundation uses their money wisely. Said one President's Club member, "If it 
weren't for ... The Heritage Foundation, I would despair for our country. You 
give me a reason for optimism." Added a corporate Executive Committee Member, 
"The Heritage Foundation has earned a reputation as an incubator of ideas ... 
[that] foster democracy, free enterprise and political freedom. We remain convinced 
that there are ample returns on our investment in Heritage and believe the 
important work of The Heritage Foundation needs to continue." And a Heritage 
Associate put it this way: "As our government becomes more oppressive and as 
our culture deteriorates look increasingly to Heritage for solutions. Keep 
up the good work."
<P>
Heritage strives to involve its supporters in the war of ideas in a number 
of ways.  During 1994, the Heritage staff held more than 400 one-on-one meetings 
with individual, foundation, and corporate donors to hear their views and to 
report on Heritage accomplishments. Heritage publications provide another avenue 
of communications. Heritage Members News, published quarterly, is distributed 
to all  200,000 members; members of the President's Club, Associates, and Founder-level 
donors also receive Heritage studies. Regular programs and events for donors 
featuring presentations by policymakers and Heritage experts include the following:

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">F</FONT>ounders</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Founders are those individuals, foundations, and corporations who 
provide $100,000 or more during the year to The Heritage Foundation.  In 1994, 
30 donors gave at the Founders level. Founders are invited to the Annual Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar and to a special Founders briefing at Heritage. 
Those who attended the 1994 briefing, held on  December 7, were able to talk 
shop with Heritage Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>; William Kristol, Chairman 
of the Project for the Republican Future; Vin Weber, Vice Chairman of Empower 
America; and Michael Joyce, President of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.
<P>


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">H</FONT>eritage <FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>ssociates</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Associates, those who give $10,000 or more, are invited, along with 
Heritage Trustees and Founders, to participate in Heritage's Annual  Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar. The 1994 meeting, the ninth in this series, 
was held in Amelia Island, FL, in April. Featured speakers were Distinguished 
Fellows William Bennett and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, author 
and Heritage Trustee Midge Decter, and author Charles Murray. Rep. Tillie Fowler 
(R-FL), who represents the northeastern Florida district in which Amelia Island 
lies, welcomed the more than 150 guests.

With the future Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, as the lead-off speaker, 
the Nov. 15 President's Club meeting was the largest in the program's 12-year 
history. The day-long event attracted more than 500 Heritage friends and supporters 
for a series of discussions on Washington's political reordering. In his speech, 
"What the Elections Mean to Conservatives," Gingrich said, "There are changes 
we have to make, and we badly need The Heritage Foundation's help intellectually 
in understanding how to make them." Dinner speaker Jack Kemp focused on Heritage's 
pivotal role as the idea factory for the conservative revolution.
<P>

Representative Gingrich also was the keynote speaker at Heritage's May President's 
Club meeting. Other speakers at the meeting included Rep. Tim Hutchinson (R-AR) 
and, at the Executive Committee luncheon, Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA).

Health care issues dominated public policy in 1994.  With many medical doctors 
feeling excluded from the health-care debate, Heritage Chairman David R. Brown, 
M.D.,  started the Physician's Council. The inaugural meeting, in June, featured 
Sens. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Connie Mack (R-FL), co-sponsors of the Consumer 
Choice Health Security Act, and Bernadine Healy, former Director of the National 
Institutes of Health.  A second meeting of the Physician's Council was held 
in conjunction with the November President's Club meeting.  Nearly 700 doctors 
had joined the Council by year end.

Issues and ideas also were on the agenda at two regional policy seminars held 
in 1994: July 18 in Monterey, CA, where Jack Kemp's keynote address focused 
on the need to make U.S. interests the centerpiece of American foreign policy, 
and March 8 in Palm Beach, FL, where the focus was health care and crime.
<P>

<P>

In addition to these two half-day regional meetings, Distinguished Fellow Bill 
Bennett and Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/vonkan.htm">John Von Kannon</a> spoke to 150 supporters 
and others at a luncheon in St. Louis, and Von Kannon addressed a meeting of 
Heritage members in Harbor Springs, MI.

1994 saw continued growth in the Windsor Society, a special group of dedicated 
Heritage Members who contribute to the Heritage Foundation's long-range financial 
objectives through their estate plans or other planned gifts. In 1994, twenty-nine 
Heritage members made commitments to Heritage totaling more than $3.5 million. 
These generous gifts will ensure that there will always be a principled conservative 
institution in Washington fighting for free enterprise, limited government, 
traditional American values, and a strong national defense. 

In February 1994, the eighth meeting of the Windsor Society was held at the 
Biltmore Hotel in Scottsdale, AZ. The three-day conference focused on the crucial 
battle over health care that was unfolding in Washington. Heritage experts 
and more than 40 Heritage members discussed the importance of the health care 
debate in terms of America's future. Presentations on estate planning were 
also available to interested Heritage members, not only to support their deeply 
held conservative beliefs, but also to assist them and their families in their 
financial planning.  
<P>
The Windsor Society continues to help build the future financial support Heritage 
will need to continue fighting well into the 21st century for the values and 
principles which built America.

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
Ideas count - and the best way to express ideas remains the written word. Heritage 
offered Washington lots of words in 1994,  publishing more than 250 books, 
monographs, and policy studies. The papers ranged from brief commentaries to 
5,000-to-10,000-word "Backgrounders" and lengthier monographs, such as 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues 
'94: The Candidate's Briefing Book</a>," "A Citizen's Guide to Regulation," and 
"
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 1995 publication released in December. Regular 
newsletters included "Heritage Today" and  "Heritage Members News," featuring 
information about Heritage Foundation people and activities; "The Insider," 
reporting on publications and activities of Resource Bank groups; "Business/Education 
Insider," focusing on the role of business in education reform; and "Reforming 
Congress: Changing the Way Washington Works," which kept a watchful eye on 
the wayward Congress.
<P>
While Heritage research papers are provided free of charge to the policy-making 
community, there is great demand beyond that. In addition to printed copies, 
most Heritage policy studies also are available electronically on the NEXIS 
data-retrieval system and <a href="http://www.townhall.com">Town Hall</a>, the conservative computer network co-owned 
by Heritage and National Review. Town Hall operates as a private forum on CompuServe. 
Some Heritage publications are available additionally on audiotape. 

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>olicy <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eview</H3></CENTER>

Heritage's flagship publication is <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>. Sprightly and unpredictable, 
Policy Review reached an all-time high in paid circulation in 1994: 30,000, 
a 30 percent  increase over the previous year. 
<p>
Policy Review's impact, however, continued to exceed its circulation. The summer 
issue, for example, featured a prescient article, "Flanagan's Island: How Boys 
Town Rescues Troubled Teens." Following the GOP sweep in November's congressional 
elections, Boys Town became a symbol for the kind of "tough love" proposed 
in the GOP's welfare-reform plan. The spring issue featured an article by Houston 
constable Victor Trevino, "Zebra Territory: The Courage of Houston's Volunteer 
Cops." A Mexican immigrant, Trevino told how he has organized volunteer patrols 
in his district, cutting truancy in half and crime by 10 percent without increasing 
taxes. The fall issue featured a headline-making article by  Rush Limbaugh: 
"Voice of America: Why Liberals Fear Me."  Excerpts appeared in the Sunday 
Los Angeles Times and dozens of other newspapers. The talk-radio phenomenon 
had been explored earlier in the year in "The Gurus of Gab," a lively symposium 
featuring 10 of America's top talkers. Among the prominent political figures 
with 1994 Policy Review bylines were Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX); Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-TX); Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL); and Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler.

<p>
"This is Mike Rosen, KOA, Denver broadcasting live from the studios of The 
Heritage Foundation in Washington."
<P>
Those and similar words were heard frequently by talk-radio listeners around 
the country in 1994, following the opening of Heritage's new broadcast facilities. 
Equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, the studio enables talk-show hosts 
to do live broadcasts from Heritage's Capitol Hill headquarters.
<P>
Heritage already was becoming a "home away from home" for talk show hosts visiting 
the nation's capital, with live broadcasts during the year by Boston's Earl 
Jackson, Seattle's Dave Ross, and Richmond's Blanquita Walsh Cullum, among 
others. The remote broadcast facilities were opened to meet the growing demand. 
<P>

<P>
Heritage's work with talk radio, part of a broader broadcast media program, 
began several years ago - long before most other organizations realized the 
potential impact of this alternative communications medium.  
<P>
During 1994, Heritage experts made hundreds of guest appearances on radio talk 
shows, on  major television news and public affairs shows, and on the America's 
Talking, CNN, CNBC, C-SPAN, and National Empowerment Television (NET) call-in 
shows. Dozens of Heritage lectures and events also were seen on C-SPAN.  
<P>
The work with the broadcast media is just one facet of Heritage's wide-ranging 
communications program. Intended to familiarize political activists, opinion 
leaders, and the broader general public with the positive message of contemporary 
conservatism, the program also includes the Heritage Speakers Bureau, Heritage's 
pioneering "op-ed page" program, and a variety of other activities aimed at 
specialized audiences.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">O</FONT>pinion and <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommentary</H3></CENTER>

<P>
The op-ed page program provides Heritage analysts and executives with an opportunity 
to give their views on the important issues of the day without having to go 
through the usual news "filtering" process. During 1994, Heritage bylines appeared 
in hundreds of  U.S. and overseas newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, 
Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington 
Times,  International Herald Tribune, USA Today, Buffalo News, Charlotte Observer, 
Oklahoma City Oklahoman, Orange County Register, and Pittsburgh Tribune Review. 
  <P>


Heritage also continued its relationship with Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service, 
one of the largest supplemental newswires in the country, which distributes 
Heritage op-ed page essays every week as part of a <a href="/heritage/commentary/welcome.html">commentary</a> package.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>argeted <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommunications</H3></CENTER>
<P>
While most Heritage public relations activities involve the mass media, targeted 
communications also are important. 
<P>
The Speakers Bureau, for example, helped bring Heritage's conservative message 
to dozens of college campuses and business, professional, and civic organizations 
in 1994. While their primary focus remained  research, writing, and policy, 
Heritage analysts and executives met collectively with thousands of individuals 
around the country who had come to hear them speak. Among the many institutions 
providing Heritage speakers with a platform were the American Association of 
Colleges and Universities, American Society of Association Executives, Chautauqua 
Institution, Close Up Foundation, Colorado State University, and Grove City 
College, where Ed Feulner delivered the 1994 commencement address. Others included 
the Inter-American Defense College, National Petroleum Refiners Association, 
National Youth Leadership Forum, People to People, Rubber Manufacturers Association, 
St. Lawrence University, Texas A&M University, and World Affairs Council of 
Orange County. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/">Town Hall</a>, the "interactive" computer network co-owned by 
Heritage and National Review magazine, Heritage in 1994 was included in "Profnet," 
a national computer information network linking U.S. newsrooms with colleges 
and universities and a handful of think tanks around the country.
<P>
Heritage also continued to work closely in 1994 with Westcott Communications, 
a major publicly traded company that provides information and produces workplace 
training videos for corporate managers and executives in a number of specialized 
fields, including health care and financial management.
<P>


And Heritage successfully relaunched the Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific 
Press (WRAPP). The organization, which had existed for several years in the 
1980s, is intended to help provide Washington-based Asian correspondents with 
better access to the Washington policymaking .

<B><h2><I><center>
Does It Really Matter How The Government Estimates The Revenue Gains And Losses From Changes In The Tax 
Laws?</h2></B></I></center>
<hr>
 <P>
Absolutely.  For example, in 1986 the government wanted more tax
revenue, so it effectively increased taxes on commercial real
estate.  Thus, investors' after-tax net rates of return on commercial
real estate were significantly reduced.  Naturally, and as a result,
real estate values and prices came tumbling down, leading to defaults
on mortgages, failed S &amp; Ls, failed banks, and jobs lost.
 Government bailouts (i.e., more taxpayer taxes) followed.
<P>
Every taxpayer has been severely damaged, directly or indirectly,
because of these ill-considered tax increases.  Far more tax revenue
and economic growth was lost (and will be lost) because of these
real estate tax increases than any related revenue gain estimated
by the government in 1986.
<P>
And, of course, there was the luxury tax on boats, enacted in
1990, that was supposed to increase tax revenue.  All it did was
wipe out jobs and lose tax revenue.  Government tax revenue estimators
do not take into account the rational, to-be-expected response
of taxpayers to tax law changes.
<P>
Further, as so clearly demonstrated in this analysis, the government's
revenue estimation methods as applied to tax-deductible saving
create a tax policy that faces 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
 The economic costs to our nation of this gigantic error can be
measured in trillions of dollars.
<P>
Government revenue estimation methodologies are scandalously wrong.
This must be corrected.

<h2><B><i>&quot;Our Nation's Debt Is Sky High Already&quot;</center>
<br>
<center>&quot;More Debt From Universal, Unlimited IRA Tax Deferrals 
Scares Me To Death!&quot;</B></h2>
</center></i>
<hr>
Sound familiar?
<P>
According to the Committee on Ways and Means' Green Book (that
describes their income tax revenue estimates), tax-deductible
contributions to IRAs are considered as &quot;tax expenditures,&quot;
and &quot;...tax expenditures can be viewed as...spending programs.&quot;
<P>
In other words, the taxes deferred by tax-deductible IRAs are
treated by the government as if they were part of a spending program
that increases government debt.
<P>
The government, and many others, claim that these tax-deferred
saving programs are undesirable, because:  (a) government debt
is sky-high already; and (b) sound governance dictates that the
government's deficit and debt must be reduced.
<P>
Any debt, private or government, can finance either fruitless
spending or fruitful enterprise.  For example, a person's first
home mortgage probably sends his or her debt sky-high, but the
debt is collateralized by the home and reflects the borrower's
favorable prospect for repayment of the loan.  Such debt is not
considered fruitless.  Certainly, too, the lender treats the mortgage
as an asset upon which it expects to earn income.
<P>
In much the same way, IRA-related government debt is good, not
bad.  In reality, every penny of government debt arising from
IRAs is offset by the directly-related free-market investments
held within each taxpayer's IRA.  The tax money that wasn't collected
by the government didn't disappear-and it wasn't spent on consumption;
it was invested in income-producing assets, adding to the total
income of the economy, hence to total government tax revenues.
 
<P>
In accordance with law, all of this tax money is actually held
in trust within the IRA for the future payment of taxes and invested
in income-producing assets.  Each taxpayer has a legal liability
to pay his or her taxes upon any IRA withdrawal.  Thus, with every
dollar saved in an IRA, the government always obtains a tax receivable,
a governmental asset, that always matches the taxpayer's liability.
<P>
Certainly, too, if a bank loaned you money for a business and
you put up collateral equal to two to six times the size of the
loan, a bank wouldn't impose a second layer of cost upon you that
required you to pay a percent of the relevant increase in the
equity in your business each year until you paid off your loan
in full.  Such a second layer of cost is analogous to the government's
second layer of tax on saving under the ordinary income tax for
people in the various income tax brackets.  How long do you think
that bank would stay in business unless it had the sovereign power
of government to impose its will?
<P>
As shown in this analysis, with tax-deductible IRAs, the government
can make huge amounts of money by:  (a) not being so quick to
tax a taxpayer's income before he or she can even save and invest
it; and (b) not taxing the returns on that saving each year thereafter.
 Collecting taxes when saving ceases is proper and productive
taxation for the government.
<P>
Clearly, IRA-related government debt does not arise from any government
spending, it arises solely from taxpayers' saving.  Every home
owner with a mortgage knows that his or her liabilities (debt)
have increased-but so have his or her assets.  Thus, debt is not
inherently bad.  Our nation would be far poorer without it.  The
same accounting and economic perspectives are properly analogous
to tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Further, tax-deductible IRAs, in the aggregate and over time,
will create far more tax revenues for the government than can
flow from the suffocating financial and economic effects that
arise from the ordinary income tax on saving.
<P>
Tax-deductible IRAs increase new saving and private capital formation,
thereby creating more jobs and productivity growth.  From this,
our nation's economic fortunes will spiral upward, not spiral
downward, as currently induced by the ordinary income tax treatment
of saving.
<P>
<b>Existing Government Debt &amp; Existing IRA Assets</b>
<P>
Our nation's existing qualified plan assets (the assets of pensions,
profit sharing, 401(k) plans, IRAs, etc.) currently total more
than three trillion dollars.  In reality, these assets, primarily
investments in private enterprises, represent the present-value
of future taxable benefits payable to plan participants over some
future period of time.
<P>
If we assume that, on average, these taxpayers will be in the
30&#177;% tax bracket when benefits are paid, then 30&#177;% of
the $3&#177; trillion of qualified plan assets represent the present-value
of future taxes, or $900&#177; billion.  These mega-billions of
dollars currently held in trust for the payment of future taxes
offset an equal amount of directly-related government debt.  The
additional production that flows from these investments, and the
tax revenues on the additional income that production generates,
means that the government's finances are strengthened by these
savings.
<P>
These billions of tax receivables show up nowhere as assets on
our government's tax books.  That's as if the bank that loaned
mortgage money considered all such loans as spending (or losses)
until each repayment is received in some future year.  
<P>
Government debt arising from tax-deductible IRAs reflects a reservoir
of immense financial strength for our nation.  The dynamic tax
revenue gains for the government from universal IRAs will, in
reality, reduce and eventually eliminate that debt over a period
of time.
<P>
It is also very appropriate to point out that even though current
government tax policy decries tax deductions for IRAs, pensions,
and other tax deferred savings programs, the government simultaneously
casts covetous eyes at the wonderful, tax deferred, free-market
accumulations of assets now held within these plans.  The government
seems capable of ignoring the fact that this major reservoir of
free-market capital wouldn't be there without the tax deductions
and tax deferrals the government abhors.  
<P>
Every taxpayer must be constantly vigilant to protect this reservoir
of jobs creating capital from the social engineers within government
who would prefer, if permitted, to dictate how some, or all, of
these assets are to be invested, and/or who would prefer to tap
this reservoir of wealth by imposing more taxes thereon either
directly or indirectly.
<P>
<I>Tax-deductible, tax deferred, free-market assets are the lifeblood
of our nation.  They must be protected and nourished constantly
and vigorously.</I>

<CENTER><B>Popularizing Conservative Ideas</B></CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>


<P>
On Nov. 8, 1994, a conservative tide swept across America - opening a new chapter 
in the political revolution launched by President Reagan 14 years earlier.
<P>
The White House, national news media, and Washington's liberal establishment 
were surprised by both the depth and the breadth of the conservative victory. 
They were even more surprised, however, by something else: that the voters 
both understood and supported the ideas proposed during the campaign by conservative 
candidates. 
<P>
They shouldn't have been surprised. Many of the specific proposals had been 
developed at The Heritage Foundation, and almost all of them had been time-tested 
in the court of public opinion: in speeches to business and civic groups, in 
congressional Town Hall meetings, in op-ed page articles, and on talk radio. 
Maybe the Washington establishment didn't appreciate the common-sense appeal 
of the conservative policy agenda, but the voters did.
<P>
Since 1973, The Heritage Foundation has served a dual role: both as an idea 
factory and as a product-testing laboratory. The first role - policy research, 
development, and innovation - is the purpose of Heritage's ongoing research 
program. The equally important second role of popularizing and legitimizing 
Heritage Foundation policy prescriptions and the broader conservative vision 
of government is the mandate of Heritage's marketing program. 
<P>
This emphasis on marketing to Congress and the Executive Branch, the national 
and international news media, state government officials, and the business, 
academic, and policy communities is one of the things that makes Heritage different 
from other policy institutes. As a USA Today headline put it in a post-election 
feature about Heritage, "The Think Tank: Foundation bringing vision back to 
the future."
<p>

<P>
On November 21, two weeks after the election, Harvard University's John F. 
Kennedy School of Government announced it had cancelled its "Introduction to 
Congress" class in December. The Ivy League university had held the course 
for newly elected members of Congress for 22 years.  In 1994, there wasn't 
much interest in what the Harvard faculty might have to say. Instead, most 
congressional freshmen attended The Heritage Foundation's orientation program 
in Baltimore.
<P>
The Economist modestly called the change "a sign of the times." Earlier in 
the year, in its Jan. 7, 1994, issue, The Economist had forecast such a shift. 
"In the 1960s it looked as if universities would establish a monopoly over 
the life of the mind, providing policies for politicians, sinecures for writers, 
ideas for journalists and breakthroughs for industrialists." The 1980s, The 
Economist observed, "changed all that." Now, the editors wrote, governments 
in search of advice increasingly look "to think tanks such as the Institute 
of Economic Affairs in Britain and the Heritage Foundation in Washington, rather 
than to Oxford or Harvard." 
<P>

From the beginning, Congress - which has the constitutional authority to pass 
laws, ratify treaties, declare war, and approve spending - has been Heritage's 
primary audience. The government relations staff serves as an institutional 
link between the Heritage research team and the policymaking community, providing 
Congress and the Executive Branch with timely information and policy recommendations 
on matters of current interest.
<P>

<P>
With an important national election ahead, Heritage welcomed the 1994 political 
season with its 296-page candidates' briefing book, "Issues '94." The book 
was distributed free of charge to incumbents and challengers alike.  
<P>
Dozens of House and Senate candidates and several gubernatorial candidates, 
including George Pataki, who unseated New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, used the briefing 
book. As one successful congressional challenger, Ron Lewis (R-KY), wrote, 
"Heritage provided the best, most accurate facts and figures that I used in 
my campaign. They were right on target every time."
<P>

<P>

Heritage's efforts to provide policy guidance to future members of the 104th 
Congress didn't cease with the election. Most successful candidates had promised 
to challenge the status quo and cut Washington down to size. The three-day 
orientation conference offered by Heritage and Empower America provided a game 
plan for doing just that, with sessions on family tax relief, federal mandates 
and federalism, farm policy reform, fighting crime, congressional reform, health 
care, foreign policy, welfare reform, rebuilding America's defenses, the environmental 
activists' "green agenda," and cutting government. addition to the many Heritage 
analysts on the program, the list of speakers included Heritage Distinguished 
Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-WY),  Rep. W.J. 
"Billy" Tauzin (D-LA), Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton 
Dunlop, Kemper Financial Services Senior Economist John Silvia, John DiIulio 
of The Brookings Institution, Rep. Cal Dooley (D-CA), former U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, and talk show superstar Rush Limbaugh, 
who was named an "Honorary Member" of the 104th Congress's freshman class.

<P>
Seven years of intense, focused effort which included two landmark books and 
dozens of articles, papers, and seminars was rewarded in 1994 as House Republicans 
embraced most of the institutional reforms proposed by Heritage's U.S. Congress 
Assessment Project staff.
<P>
The 1988 Heritage book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>," launched the debate. Something 
is terribly wrong with Congress, the book argued, and it needs to be fixed. 
As just one example, the book listed more than a dozen federal laws, including 
the National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Minimum Wage Act, 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, Freedom of Information Act, Occupational Safety and 
Health Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, and Ethics in Government Act, 
from which Congress had exempted itself.
<P>
All of the specific reforms approved by Congress on Jan. 4-5, 1995, can be 
found in the pages of "The Imperial Congress," the 1993 Heritage sequel, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The 
Ruling Class</a>," or in the many papers produced in 1994 and prior years by David 
Mason and the "Congress Project" staff. For example, at the top of House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich's list of reforms was a promise, spelled out in the "Contract 
with America," to make "all laws that apply to the rest of the country also 
apply equally to the Congress." The new majority also moved to reduce the number 
of congressional committees and subcommittees, cut committee staff, limit the 
terms of committee chairs, open committee meetings to the public, and eliminate 
the phony "baseline budgeting" scam, which for years had allowed Washington 
to act as if it were cutting spending when it really was increasing it.
<P>

<P>
Heritage's Governors' Forum continued its efforts in 1994 to involve governors 
and state administrators more directly in federal policy decisions affecting 
their states. With the new Congress promising to return many government functions 
to the states, the program in 1995 will increase its emphasis on the concept 
of federalism.
<P>

<P>
Just two years old, the program already is seen as a major national forum. 
California Gov. Pete Wilson, for example, appeared at Heritage just days after 
his come-from-behind reelection. Seen by some as the start of a potential 1996 
presidential bid, his hard-hitting speech addressed the imbalance between state 
and federal government and how state executives can help take back some of 
the powers wrongly assumed by Washington. Other Governors' Forum speakers in 
1994 included former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Virginia Gov. George Allen 
Jr., and Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice.

<B><h2><I>Congressional Misperceptions About Measuring The Costs Of
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P><blockquote>
 &QUOT;BUT, WE DON'T DO REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WAY.&QUOT;
<P>
 &QUOT;STAFF SCOREKEEPERS WILL SHOW THAT IRAS PRODUCE HUGE REVENUE
LOSSES.  THUS, THE MEDIA, AND MY CONSTITUENTS, WILL PERCEIVE ME
AS A BIG SPENDER.&QUOT;</blockquote>

<P>

The above remarks are typical Congressional responses (with some
notable exceptions) to the League's position and documentation
that universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are the proper
method for taxing saving.
<P>
Breaking through this mind-set and the policy inertia it inspires
is not easy, but it must be done.  How?
<P>
A determined, persistent, broad-based public attack on these negative
Congressional misperceptions is imperative.  Every taxpayer, every
segment of the media, every business, union, and association,
and every professional person, including economists, actuaries,
accountants, and lawyers, should assume  responsibility for pushing
Congress and the Administration to face up to the extremely serious
fiscal problem of how our nation taxes personal saving.  All of
us must work to persuade Congressional policy makers to legislate
the right kind of tax environment for personal saving.
<P>

Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans are the proper answer
to our nation's low saving dilemma and slow economic growth. These plans
are vital to our personal, family, business, and national prosperity. <P>
<blockquote>
&QUOT;BUT, THE GOVERNMENT WANTS AND NEEDS ITS MONEY NOW.&QUOT;</blockquote>
<P>
Far too often the above comment is used by members of Congress
and others to justify the government's contention that expanding
the tax deferral of saving is not possible, because the government
wants and needs &quot;its&quot; money now.
<P>
The government's money, of course, is extracted from taxpayers'
incomes and savings-the income that workers, savers-investors,
and business entrepreneurs earn as rewards for helping to produce
things people want to buy.  The more heavily government taxes
the income people save, the less saving people undertake, and
the less investment they make in adding to the nation's productivity
and output growth.
<P>
Government, therefore, should weigh these costs of taxing the
income people save-and taxing the income that savings earn-against
its need for tax revenue now.  Government impatience in raking
in tax dollars is extremely costly to the country and, in the
long run, to the government, too.  It must never be forgotten
that the economic strength of government is bound inextricably
with the economic strength of its taxpayers.
<P>
Government patience in collecting tax revenues is particularly
important when it comes to tax-deductible saving.  Until such
saving, unfettered by taxes, is consumed, it performs highly constructive
triple duty by (1) providing investment growth and/or income for
the saver, and (2) providing more capital to create production,
jobs, and profits, all of which (3) generate more taxes for the
government.
<P>
Only when the taxpayer wants to use for consumption some of the
income he or she has saved and invested should that income be
taxed.
<P>
Saving must come first for the government and taxpayer alike.
 Taxes must come last when saving stops.

<B><h2><I><center>The U.S. Government's 1995 Budget Estimates Of The Costs
Of IRAs</B></I></h2></center>
<hr>
<P>
The U.S. government's 1995 Budget, for the first time ever, has
included discounted present-value estimates of revenue losses
for certain &quot;tax expenditures&quot; set forth elsewhere in
the Budget presentation (The 1995 Budget of the United States
Government-Analytical Perspectives, pages 59, 60, &amp; 61).
<P>
The government describes these present-value estimates as &quot;representing
the tax expenditure revenue losses, net of future tax payments.&quot;
The 1995 budget document explains that the tax deferrals on the
contributions, and on the accrued earnings thereon (i.e., tax
expenditures), will eventually be paid out upon an IRA withdrawal
when taxes will then be due.  Thus, these expected receipts are
included in these government present-value estimates.  The government
also points out that the discount rate used for the present-value
estimates is the interest rate on comparable maturity Treasury
debt.
<P>
Based upon the above, the government's 1995 Budget document presented
the following estimates for IRAs:
<P>
<pre>		1994 Tax Revenue Loss Estimates for IRAs
		----------------------------------------	
			(In Millions Of Dollars)

	Tax Expenditure 			$5,415 (a)

	Discounted Present-Value
 	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 		$1,735 (b)
</pre>

Based on the above figures, the &quot;present-value&quot; costs of IRAs (b
above) only equal 32% of the tax expenditure costs (a above) used by the
government in formulating tax policy. <P>

In view of the fact that the government recovers the full IRA tax
deduction with interest upon a withdrawal, the above present-value costs
(b above) reflect solely the cost arising from the &quot;second
layer&quot; of ordinary income tax (double taxation) that should not be
imposed in the first place (see pages 6 &amp; 7). <P>

Clearly, the government now admits that its alleged cost estimate for IRAs
in 1994 is not $5.4 billion, but 68% less, i.e., $1,735,000. <I>In effect,
the government admits by its own analysis that its alleged &quot;tax
expenditure&quot; costs for IRAs that are used in formulating tax
legislation are three times higher than they should be!<B> </B>($5.4
billion &#247; $1.7 billion = 3.18)</I>

<P> And even the above severely reduced alleged cost of $1.7 billion is
erroneous, because, as portrayed earlier in this analysis, the government
is assuming that all the saving in IRAs is old saving.  This means that
the government would have, if it had not been for the IRAs, collected its
&quot;second layer&quot; of tax.  This second layer of tax is an improper,
self-defeating form of taxation. 

<P> The government also ignores the fact that there is <I>no</I> cost to
the government if IRA contributions are <I>new</I> saving. Further, the
government calculation <I>omits</I> the dynamic economic gains from
tax-deductible IRAs that create more capital through increased saving,
thereby increasing production, creating more jobs, higher standards of
living, and yes-more taxes. 

<P> <I>The magnitude of the true costs to our nation's economy arising
from such erroneous tax revenue estimates is virtually beyond
comprehension.  It is shocking, scandalous, and worthy of imposed
investigation and correction.</I>

<title>What Is The American Conservative Union?</title> 
 </head>
<body>
<CENTER><H2>What Is The American Conservative Union? </H2></CENTER> 
<HR> 
<center><a name="table"></a>
<a href="#ratings">Ratings</a><br>
<a href="#pubs">Publications</a><br>
<a href="#cpac">CPAC</a><br>
<a href="#staff">Staff and Officers</a><br><hr>
  </center> 
 <P> 
 The American Conservative Union is the nation's oldest conservative   
lobbying organization. ACU's purpose is to effectively communicate and   
advance the goals and principles of conservatism through one multi-issue,   
umbrella organization. The <a href="/conservative/acu.html">Statement of Principles</a> makes clear ACU's   
support of capitalism, belief in the doctrine of original intent of the   
framers of the Constitution, confidence in traditional moral values, and   
commitment to a strong national defense.  
 <P> 
Over the years, ACU has been on the cutting edge of major public policy   
battles. Among ACU's significant efforts, past and present, are opposing   
President Clinton's bureaucratic health proposal, his excessive spending   
and taxes, the Panama Canal giveaway, fighting to keep OSHA off the   
back of small businesses, opposing the SALT treaties, supporting aid to   
freedom fighters in Marxist countries, promoting the confirmation of   
conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, battling against higher taxes,   
and advocating the need for near-term deployment of strategic defenses.   
 <P> 
In 1994, through its Citizens Against Rationing Health coalition,   
sponsorship of national "town meetings," and a "Health Care Truth   
Tour," ACU spearheaded the conservative response on the health   
reform issue.  
 <P> 
Whether fighting for lower taxes and less government spending, more   
effective and efficient military protection, or the cause of freedom world-  
wide, by speaking for the entire conservative movement the American   
Conservative Union is always "Your Conservative Voice in Washington."  
 <P> 
<a name="ratings"><h3>RATINGS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1971, ACU has published annual ratings of Congress. Each   
member of the House and Senate is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, based on   
actual votes cast on a wide range of issues. The ratings are designed to   
show how members vote on all the major issues to gauge their adherence   
to conservative principles. As the conservative rating listed in all major   
political almanacs and reference guides, the ACU ratings are often quoted   
by the media and are extensively used by political strategists and   
candidates running for public office.  
 <P> 
The American Conservative Union has periodically published several   
special Voting Indices on specific important issue areas such as defense   
and SDI, judicial nominations, and pork barrel spending. In election   
years, the ACU has provided Interim Ratings of Congress to track votes   
that occurred during that Session before the elections.  
 <P> 
  
<a name="pubs"><h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>
 <P> 
ACU publishes selected legislative guides that are working manuals   
primarily used by members of Congress and their staffs. One example is   
<i>The Clinton Plan: More Power to Government</i>, documenting the  
Clinton record, and showing how he has consistently worked to give more power to Big Government -- and less to the American people.  
Another is <i><a href="/conservative/platformwelcome.html">The 1996 Committee for a Conservative Platform</a>  
</i>; a coalition effort by more than thirty groups to keep the Republican Party platform conservative.  
 <P> 
ACU has also produced audio and video messages, such as TV   
documentaries on the SALT treaties and the Panama Canal, among   
others. Recent productions have included hard-hitting ads on the Clinton   
gas tax, opposition to an invasion of Haiti, and an "infomercial" on health   
care reform. Complete A-V tapes of CPAC proceedings are also made   
available each year.  
 <P> 
<a name="cpac"><h3>CPAC</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1974, the ACU has hosted the annual <a href="http://www.cpac.org">Conservative Political   
Action Conference</a>. Thousands of conservative activists and leaders from   
around the nation meet for three days to discuss current issues and   
policies, and set the agenda for the future. Open to the general public,   
CPAC always offers a distinguished cast of participants. Among them   
have been Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Vice   
President Dan Quayle, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, numerous other Senators and Representatives, Cabinet   
officers, media correspondents, international celebrities and other key   
political figures. CPAC serves to bring dedicated and talented Americans   
into the conservative movement and to train and motivate them for   
political action.<P>

<title>William W. Pascoe, III -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the American Conservative Union, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bob McEwen (1992-93); Managing Partner of his own public affairs consulting firm, Pascoe, Norquist, Jones & Co. (1990-92); Executive Director of Krieble Associates, Inc., a private foundation and public affairs office in Washington dedicated to providing assistance to democratic activists behind the Iron Curtain (1988-90); liaison to the conservative community for Bush/Quayle '88, as Director of the Office of National Voter Coalitions (1988); Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation (1985-88); and consultant to the U.S. Department of State (1984-85).<p>
Mr. Pascoe was the Republican nominee for the 47th District seat in the Virginia General Assembly in 1987.<p>
Mr. Pascoe was graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Government and History in 1982, and an MA in Foreign Affairs in 1984.  He is a member of the Council for National Policy, the World Affairs Council of Washington, and MENSA.   <p>

<B><h2><I><center>What's The Cost?</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P>

That question is immediately asked by every member of the Congress
who considers tax legislation.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA legislation is certainly no exception, because the words &quot;universal,&quot;
&quot;unlimited,&quot; and &quot;tax-deductible&quot; invoke the
prospect of a large &quot;cost.&quot;
<P>
Congressional policy makers' thinking in these terms is encouraged
by the treatment of tax provisions like IRAs in the government's
so-called Tax Expenditure Budget.  Estimates prepared by the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the tax expenditures (i.e.,
&quot;costs,&quot; in the vernacular of Congress) for various
&quot;Income Security&quot; budget functions are shown in the
following table.  By precedent or rule, all members of Congress
use these figures as the basis for their legislative considerations.

* From Joint Committee Taxation Report
</pre>

The April 22, 1993, Joint Committee on Taxation report states that these
&quot;Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct <I>spending
programs</I> which have no spending limits, and which are available as
entitlements to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the
programs&quot; (emphasis added). Direct spending entitlement programs
include:  Social Security, railroad retirement, federal employees
retirement and insurance, unemployment assistance, Medicare, Medicaid,
veterans hospital care, housing, nutrition, public assistance programs,
etc. <P>

As previously discussed in this analysis, the tax expenditure figures
cited above are not &quot;spendings,&quot; regardless of the label used by
the staff.  And, in no way are net exclusions of pension contributions and
earnings &quot;most similar to direct spending programs&quot; such as
those listed in the paragraph above.  In reality, pension exclusions
result in &quot;tax deferrals&quot; (a government asset) upon which the
government receives a free-market rate of total return. <P>

Over three trillion dollars of &quot;qualified plan&quot; assets are now
held by various qualified plan trusts.  Those assets include the past
&quot;net exclusions,&quot; such as those cited in the table above. 
Because most of these assets were acquired by <I>new</I> saving undertaken
in response to the tax deferral, the various plans' aggregate tax
liability to the government with respect to those assets far exceeds the
directly-related government debt arising from the past net exclusions. 
This is particularly true of employer pension plans that generated huge
amounts of new saving over the years.  Over more recent years, however,
senseless and self-defeating funding constrictions imposed by Congress on
the plans have resulted in cut-backs and the abandonment of plans to the
great detriment of our economy. <P>

Regardless of the dollar magnitude of the &quot;tax expenditure&quot; that
the staff may estimate for universal IRAs, it must be recognized that not
a nickel of that amount is spent on consumption; every bit of it is
invested by the IRA owner in income-producing assets. If the average
taxpayers' tax bracket is 25%, for example, the total sum that's invested
in these IRAs will be four times the alleged tax expenditure.  Most of
that investment will be saving that wouldn't have been undertaken if the
universal IRA tax treatment hadn't been provided.  That's the greatest
thing that could happen to our nation's low rate of private saving.  As a
result thereof, our economy will expand dramatically, thereby providing
more production, more jobs, an increasing standard of living, and more
taxes. <P> In reality, contrary to the government's position that the
above &quot;exclusions&quot; are a cost, they should be viewed as a
working asset invested in free-market enterprise.  Thus, the larger the
aggregate tax deductions, the more positive are the prospective real
economic results.  <I>The government's disastrous perception of the
economic effects of tax-deferred saving faces 180 degrees in the wrong
direction!</I> <P> 

A few years ago a highly respected Washington, D.C., actuary (Paul H.
Jackson, FSA, The Wyatt Company), who specialized in pensions, wrote a
brief analysis of the government's methodology in determining pension tax
expenditures.  This analysis was published in the Newsletter of the
Society of Actuaries.  Mr. Jackson noted that within Congress, tax
expenditure figures are generally accepted as &quot;fact.&quot;  He also
noted that the largest single tax expenditure is the exclusion of pension
contributions, and investment income thereon, from the taxable income of
covered individuals.  Mr. Jackson concluded that &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost useless
for budget purposes.&quot;  He also concluded that &quot;...any tax law
based on such arbitrary and capricious figures can only be good by
accident.&quot; Mr. Jackson hit the nail on the head in precise, actuarial
fashion. 

<P>
<I>It is shocking that our government's fundamental tax policy,
as it relates to the vitally important fiscal element of tax-deferred
saving, rests upon analyses that are aptly described as being
&quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; and that produce legislation
that &quot;can only be good by accident.&quot;</I>

<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
In August, at the end of a mind-numbing, daylong congressional hearing on welfare 
reform, Heritage Foundation Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> began his remarks.
<P>
"The `War on Poverty' has been an incredibly costly failure," he told the House 
Human Relations Subcommittee.
<P>
The "welfare state" is made up of some 75 programs targeted to low-income and 
poor Americans, with a total annual cost exceeding $324 billion; the nation 
has spent $5.3 trillion since the War on Poverty began, he said.
<P>
"What are the names of these programs? Do you have a listing of these programs?" 
interrupted the Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Harold Ford, Tennessee Democrat.
<P>
"They're listed in my testimony," said Mr. Rector, who went on to explain that 
the average tax-paying household spent $3,400 in 1993 to combat poverty and 
that by 1999, the nation could be spending $550 billion a year on welfare.
<P>
"I'm going to correct you now," Mr. Ford interrupted again. The subcommittee, 
he explained, was only interested in hearing about Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children (AFDC), food stamps, and Medicaid.
<P>
"With all due respect ... you are not going to come here to this committee 
and give us these numbers," Mr. Ford said. "You are not going to leave the 
public perception that we are spending all these billions and billions of dollars 
on welfare."
<P>

<P>

<P>
The above story was recalled in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/Wash_Times/">The Washington Times</a> in a major year-end feature 
on welfare reform. Despite Congressman Ford's denials, Heritage's Robert Rector 
is correct: The official Congressional Research Service includes more than 
80 distinct programs in its inventory of "means-tested"  federal welfare programs. 
<P>

Like others at Heritage, Rector spends much of his time challenging conventional 
wisdom. You can't "end welfare as we know it," he says, unless you first understand 
both the nature of poverty and the patchwork system cobbled together during 
the past 30 years to fight it. Rector is one of the few in Washington who understands 
both, and the "fix" he proposed in his August testimony - and in numerous speeches 
and talk-radio appearances throughout the year - can be seen in the House GOP's 
"Contract with America." As <a href="http://www.townhall.com/nationalreview/">National Review</a> described Rector's proposal in 
a Dec. 31, 1994, editorial: "The Heritage Foundation-inspired Talent-Faircloth 
bill takes 65 welfare programs with 10,000 pages of regulations and boils them 
down to one block grant with a short set of guiding principles." The rest of 
the story will be written in 1995.
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

<P>

Throughout 1994, Heritage Foundation analysts repeatedly challenged both the 
conventional wisdom and the status quo. 
<P>
In a few instances, Heritage's role was primarily that of honest critic. The 
administration's crime bill, for example, almost failed after Heritage's Scott 
Hodge examined the fine print and found that the bulk of the funds would be 
spent on spurious "crime prevention" measures, such as arts and crafts and 
midnight basketball leagues. Heritage also was a vigorous critic of the administration's 
health-care plan, its re-regulation of the economy, its misguided foreign policy, 
and the haphazard way in which it has reduced defense spending.
<P>
In most cases, Heritage analysts were ready with concrete alternatives to the 
flawed proposals. The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan, for example, provided 
Washington with a principled private-sector solution to America's health-care 
problems - a solution that would increase the choices available to most Americans 
while still helping to control medical costs. Heritage's foreign-policy blueprint, 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>,"  brought to international affairs a sense 
of mission and purpose lacking in the administration's foreign policy. Heritage's 
updated prosperity plan for America, "Putting Families First" - a comprehensive 
program for strengthening family finances, promoting capital expansion, and 
balancing the budget - served as the basis of the alternative budget offered 
by congressional Republicans. And "The Index of Economic Freedom," released 
at year end, not only showed how the U.S. foreign aid program has gone astray, 
but offered a focused free-market approach to revitalizing the wasteful program.
<P>

<P>

There were even instances when the administration and The Heritage Foundation 
found themselves in agreement. John M. Olin Senior Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/cobb.htm">Joe Cobb</a>, for example, 
played a pivotal role in the debate over the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and was publicly credited by both the White House and the media 
with helping to blunt protectionist attacks on the global trade pact.
<P>
Throughout its 21-year history, The Heritage Foundation has always tried to 
make a difference. As the following stories show, the entire Heritage organization 
- research; government, media, and business relations; the lectures and seminars 
program; Policy Review; and Heritage's more than 200,000 community ambassadors: 
its members - all play a role in Heritage's efforts to change the direction 
of public policy. Sometimes, the entire organization may be involved in a project. 
Other times, a single analyst or a single study - when properly marketed to 
key members of Congress and the right mix of media opinion-leaders - can change 
the course of the debate.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">I</FONT>t's a <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>rime</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress's bitter summer debate over the administration's crime bill, for example, 
might never have taken place if it weren't for the tenacity of Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">Bill 
Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.  
<P>
When the anti-crime package was first introduced, the bill was expected to 
sail through both houses of Congress by wide margins. After all, with drug-related 
street crime running rampant in most urban areas, what politician wanted to 
be seen as an opponent of crime control? Then Bennett, the former Secretary 
of Education and U.S. drug czar, and Hodge, Heritage's Grover M. Hermann Fellow 
in Federal Budgetary Affairs, took a closer look at the proposal. 
<P>
Bennett, the first public figure to criticize the proposal, found that the 
federal government was once again usurping the power and authority of state 
and local government. Hodge's analysis struck closer to home. Rather than put 
100,000 new police officers on America's streets, as the administration claimed, 
Hodge found that the crime bill would finance only 20,000 police officers - 
leaving state and local government with the rest of the tab. [A subsequent 
Heritage study showed each state exactly how much.] The remainder of the more 
than $30 billion Congress was being asked to approve, Hodge's analysis showed, 
was earmarked for various "crime prevention" initiatives - urban pork - that 
duplicated existing programs, none of which had done much to deter crime. 
<P>
Hodge's findings were marketed aggressively to the news media and immediately 
vaulted to the top of talk radio's list of hottest topics. Critics on Capitol 
Hill quickly joined the fray, and support for the legislation went into free 
fall - all because of a single study that looked beyond the rhetoric at the 
details. So compelling were the Heritage data that the White House communications 
office issued a formal rebuttal in an effort to discredit Heritage's analysis. 
This prompted several reporters to do some homework of their own. To the great 
consternation of the White House, they found that Hodge was correct. As a Harris 
poll later confirmed, a majority of the public got the Heritage message: the 
crime bill was more about pork than about fighting crime. 
<P>
The White House effort to discredit Heritage failed - and the crime bill nearly 
failed with it. In the end, the legislation was approved by a very narrow margin, 
but congressional pork-busters are revisiting the bill in 1995.
<P>

<P>
Heritage's involvement in the health-care debate began in 1989 before there 
was a national health-care debate. Since the publication of that original Heritage 
Foundation monograph, "A National Health System for America" (Stuart M. Butler 
and Edmund F. Haislmaier, editors), Heritage has published more than 50 papers 
on the various problems plaguing the health financing system and the proposals 
- good and bad - for fixing those problems. During the summer of 1994, for 
example, as Congress rushed ahead with alternatives to the mortally wounded 
Clinton Health Security Act,  Heritage's research team worked around the clock 
to offer detailed analyses of proposed alternatives. In one three-week period 
in August, Heritage published and publicized 12 different studies detailing 
the serious problems with various health-care proposals.
<P>
In the end,  the entire effort to increase the government's control over health 
care in America collapsed. The final chapter was a war of words over which 
reform plan would give ordinary Americans the same kind of health coverage 
enjoyed by government officials. 
<P>
It was a war Heritage's analysts and media specialists had spent all year preparing 
for - because only Heritage could win this war. As Heritage asked in a widely 
published advertisement: "Hillary Rodham Clinton Has It. George Stephanopoulos 
Has It. Donna Shalala and all Cabinet Members Have It. Ted Kennedy Has It. 
So Why Can't All Americans Have What They Have?" 
<P>


What they have, we explained, is "a health benefits system that allows them 
to choose among dozens of competing health-care insurers and providers, works 
with a minimum of regulation ... and because it relies on the principles of 
choice and competition, has successfully controlled costs." This was important 
because just one reform proposal, the Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan 
(and its legislative version, the Nickles-Stearns Consumer Choice Health Security 
Act), was similar in design to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program 
(FEHBP). 
<P>
In truth, FEHBP is a government program in name only; all benefits are provided 
by private insurers who compete with one another for business. By focusing 
attention on FEHBP - in hundreds of radio talk-show appearances, speeches, 
congressional Town Hall meetings, Capitol Hill briefings, and newspaper editorial 
board meetings - Heritage experts were able not only to point to an existing 
market-based system that works, but to demonstrate the insincerity of Washington 
officials who would impose a government-run system on most Americans while 
retaining a consumer-based system for themselves.
<P>

<P>
With time running out, most major sponsors of reform legislation - including 
President Clinton, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), and other backers of government-run 
health care - had no choice but to claim their proposals' kinship to FEHBP, 
even if it wasn't true. Those who had been closely following the health-care 
debate knew better; only the Heritage plan - based on the principles of individual 
choice and market competition  - followed the successful model.
<P>
While support for the other reform plans withered as the details became better 
known, support for the Heritage approach increased as details became more widely 
known. The support was as broad as it was deep. Some 25 members of the Senate 
and an equal number of House members co-sponsored the Nickles-Stearns bill. 
The Heritage approach also was endorsed by several state medical societies, 
a national association of nursing homes, and more than 150 newspapers, magazines, 
and columnists. Meanwhile, some 700 individual doctors became personal advocates 
of the consumer-choice plan as members of the Heritage Foundation Physician's 
Council.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">B</FONT>ottoms <FONT SIZE = "+2">U</FONT>p</H3></CENTER>
<P>
When Heritage defense analysts <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> and John Luddy warned in March 
that the Clinton administration had underfunded its own defense plan, the so-called 
"Bottom-Up Review," by a five-year total of $100 billion, the White House and 
Pentagon cried foul.
<P>
A few months later, they - and the rest of Washington - discovered that The 
Heritage Foundation is true to its word when it describes itself as a "conservative" 
think tank. Congress's auditing arm, the General Accounting Office (GAO), took 
its own look at the mismatch between the administration's defense plan and 
the Pentagon budget and found that Heritage's $100 billion estimate had been 
very conservative. The shortfall, GAO said, was closer to $150 billion.
<P>
After the GOP takeover of Congress - which catapulted two long-time friends 
of Heritage's,  Sen. Strom Thurmond and Rep. Floyd Spence, South Carolina Republicans, 
into the chairmanship of the Senate and House Armed Services committees - the 
administration suddenly "got religion" and admitted that the defense budget 
would have to be increased substantially in order to maintain military readiness. 
The increase the administration proposed was inadequate, but at least it was 
a start.
<P>
Heritage's analysts, meanwhile, continued to identify billions of dollars in 
non-defense pork that had been buried in the defense budget. Defense spending, 
no doubt, will be a major policy issue in 1995. 
<P>

<P>
From the crush of reporters and the bank of television cameras lined up in 
the long, rectangular room, you would have thought that President Clinton or 
Pope John Paul II was present. Instead, the star attraction was a radio talk-show 
host. Not any talk-show host, mind you, but the king: Rush Limbaugh.
<P>
The occasion was The Heritage Foundation's orientation conference for newly 
elected members of the 104th Congress. For many of the more than 65 new members 
of the House and Senate who attended the three-day (Dec. 8-10) Baltimore conference, 
co-sponsored with Empower America, the conference was more like a family reunion. 
They already knew Heritage. One new congressman told <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> he had refined 
his political philosophy over the years by reading <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, Heritage's 
quarterly journal. Many of the others had used Heritage research during their 
campaigns.
<P>
No election in recent memory was more about issues and ideas than the contests 
that took place on Nov. 8, 1994. The House GOP's "Contract with America" - 
attacked by liberals throughout the campaign - provided voters with a concrete 
list of institutional and policy changes. As a number of reporters noted, many 
of the proposals had been seen before - in Heritage books and policy papers.
<P>
True to their promise, Congress's new Republican majority used the first day 
of the 104th Congress to perform surgery on the Congress itself. The "Contract 
with America" had promised a series of far-reaching changes "aimed at restoring 
the faith and trust of the American people in government." Virtually every 
one of these sweeping institutional changes - including a measure that would 
apply all U.S. laws to the Congress itself - had been proposed in Heritage's 
1993 book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">The Ruling Class</a>," and fleshed out in subsequent Heritage papers. 

<P>
As Seattle talk-show host Mike Siegel reminded his listeners in a week-long 
series of broadcasts from Heritage's radio studio the week after the election, 
the Heritage recipe for reforming Congress had been a popular staple on talk 
radio throughout 1994. Now these proposals - embraced by millions of ordinary 
Americans while bitterly opposed by much of official Washington - had made 
their way back to the Nation's Capital, and a new revolution in government 
had begun.

<P>
What follows is a report on the people and programs that make The Heritage 
Foundation an American original. 
<P>

<p>


None of the programs should be viewed in a vacuum. The wide range of activities 
is possible only because of the encouragement and active support of Heritage's 
donors. In a city long dominated by the liberal left, Heritage's research papers 
command attention not just because they are timely and thorough, but because 
they are  professionally marketed and always on the mark. And Heritage's lectures 
and seminars, Policy Review and the Resource Bank all help widen the conservative 
circle. 
<P>

<p>
The Heritage Foundation's continuing efforts to build a better America and 
a safer world involve more than 150 dedicated employees and more than 200,000 
members who express their confidence each year by providing the financial support 
that has helped Heritage make a difference for 21 years. n

<h2><center><I><B>Entitlements</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
So-called &quot;entitlements&quot; are government spending programs
that grow automatically without adequate cost control or constraint.
 Typically, these programs are initiated for modest and humanitarian
reasons.  However, their potential future costs are usually unmeasured,
measured improperly, or ignored.  Further, once established, people
become accustomed to their availability, and the benefits provided
become political magnets for enhancement due to inflation, demographic
changes in the population, and the political power of recipients.
 In short, with the passage of time, they become &quot;entitlements.&quot;
<P>
Three existing entitlement programs-Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid,
and federal welfare benefits-involve huge, ever-increasing costs
that, in aggregate when combined with interest on the national
debt, exceed the government's &quot;discretionary&quot; spending
over which it can, if it wishes, exercise control.  The growth
of these entitlement costs is alarming.
<P>
The funding of entitlement programs can only come from one contributing
source-taxpayers.  When these programs were initiated, the then-existing
contributor/recipient ratio was high (many more taxpayers were
contributors then recipients), and the level of benefits was low.
 With the passage of time, the contributor/recipient ratio has
grown much smaller, and the level of benefits has grown much larger.
 This has created an explosion of ever-increasing costs that are
borne by an ever-diminishing segment of the voter/taxpayer population.
 
<P>
Such costs can only be funded by raising taxes or by increased
governmental borrowing.  Income taxes and payroll taxes typically
transfer the economic values generated by one group of taxpayers
to another group as, for example, when younger people's payroll
taxes are used to fund older people's health care costs and pensions.
 Borrowing to cover these costs unethically passes these costs
to another generation.  
<P>
Regardless of the source of funds (tax or borrowing), these uncontrolled
entitlement spendings extract free-market capital from the marketplace.
 This, in turn, makes the economy progressively weaker, thereby
leading to a political/economic climate that fosters further enhancements
of entitlement programs.  This becomes a gradual, but never-ending,
spiral downward toward economic stagnation, unfair inter-generational
transfer payments via the tax code, and ultimate disaster.
<P>
Changing the way our nation taxes saving so that saving is promoted
and not punished can dramatically change the human/economic dynamics
that lead to these entitlements.  Taxpayers will be far better
able to accumulate assets for their retirement and life's potential
needs for health care and welfare.  Not only will free markets
grow more rapidly, thereby enhancing living standards and employment
growth, the need and pressures for entitlement programs will diminish.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can do wonders by helping
to remove the ever-increasing and divisive cost burden of entitlements
from our nation's shoulders.

<h2><center><I><B>&quot;Trickle-Down Economics&quot; And &quot;Tax Loopholes
For The Rich&quot;</h2></B></I></center>

<hr>
<P>
Both of the above inflammatory labels have been used to thwart
legislative attempts to improve, expand, and increase the allowable
tax deduction levels of IRAs.  These labels ignore the facts.
<P>
It is correct, of course, that higher-bracket taxpayers also gain
with tax-deductible IRAs.  However, as so clearly shown in this
analysis, this gain is derived solely from the removal of a crushing,
self-defeating, double and triple tax burden on saving that's
imposed by the progressive ordinary income tax.  This tax irrationally
and progressively wipes out the saving accumulations of all taxpayers.
 And, the higher the bracket, the more irrational the second layer
of tax becomes.
<P>
The ordinary income tax should not be applied to saving, because
it is progressively destructive to the government's tax revenues,
as well as the taxpayers' and our nation's wealth.  Under the
ordinary income tax, the higher the tax bracket, the greater the
destruction to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
High-bracket taxpayers should be encouraged to make unlimited,
tax-deducted contributions to IRAs.  Not only does the government
receive far higher tax revenues, the availability of investment
capital for the users of capital (in any tax bracket) is greatly
increased.  This is vital to our nation's economy.
<P>
And, it has been clearly demonstrated in many forums that the
bulk of the benefits derived from increased capital flow to labor.
 The more capital a worker has to work with, the higher is the
worker's productivity, the greater is the demand for his or her
labor, and the higher is his or her real wage rate.  In fact,
if capital doesn't increase more rapidly than labor, productivity,
employment, and real wage rates will not advance.  Increasing
the amount of capital per worker requires reducing the cost of
capital, and that requires reducing the cost of saving.  That's
what tax-deductible IRAs do.  Lowering the cost of capital will
also reduce the cost of government debt.
<P>
Small businesses, entrepreneurs, and job seekers will surely benefit
greatly from capital growth, as will all other taxpayers, both
directly and indirectly.  Without question, the slogans &quot;trickle-down
economics&quot; and &quot;tax loopholes for the rich,&quot; when
applied to universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, are nothing
but complete red herrings.

<B><h2><I><center>Pension Plans Can Become Sensible Again</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
IRAs are a form of pension.  Pension plans provide an important
and useful way for people to save.  Unfortunately, the effective
use of pension plans, including IRAs, has been more and more hampered
by one punitive change after another in the income tax laws and
regulations.  Most of these changes have resulted from the existing,
erroneous, self-defeating tax revenue estimation methodologies
of our government.
<P>
It is well-known to all pension plan sponsors, administrators,
advisers, and plan participants that pension plan tax laws, rules,
and regulations have reached the ultimate breaking-point in unfathomable
complexity and government micro-management.
<P>
These complexities are driven by the absurdity of trying to make
existing, outlandish, governmental notions of tax expenditure
revenue estimates of tax-deferred saving apply in the real world
of private enterprise.  It can't be done.
<P>
Billions of dollars are spent every year by the professions, industry,
labor, and government on examinations of the complex, interrelated
pension rules and regulations that are impossible to fathom, even
by those in government who create them or write them.
<P>
All of these complexities become unnecessary if unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs are available.  Such complexities exist because of:  (1)
the erroneous government notion that tax-deductible IRAs and other
qualified plans cost the government mega-billions of dollars of
lost revenue; and (2) the erroneous government perception that
high-bracket taxpayers are favored economically.
<P>
With universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, employers, unions,
and associations can again arrange their pension plans to fit
their own unique needs and circumstances.  Rather than having
pension plans sponsored by employers, unions, or associations
decline in number, they will increase.  Further, with universal,
unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, portable pensions become a reality.
 
<P>
Pensions of all types (defined benefit, defined contribution,
401(k), profit-sharing, thrift, annuities, etc.) will grow and
be better funded because of the recognition of the enormous contribution
of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving to the financial
well-being of our nation, our government, and of our taxpayers,
individually and collectively.
<P>
The absurdity of the ever-tightening governmental constrictions
on defined benefit pension plan funding is clearly evident when
such constrictions make the funding projections of The Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) ever-more alarming.  These
unfathomable, self-defeating, government-imposed pension plan
complexities are leading employers to abandon their defined benefit
plans to the detriment of the PBGC.  In short, the government
is fostering the abandonment of defined benefit pension plans,
with the net result that needlessly underfunded pension plans
are being dropped into the laps of taxpayers via the PBGC!
<P>
All of this convoluted government-created mess can only be corrected
when it is recognized by Congress and the Administration that
the unlimited tax deferral of saving <I>is not contrary to anyone's
interests,</I> including the government's.  It is the responsibility
of plan providers and plan participants to rise up in anger over
such irrational, self-destructive government.

<h2><center><I><B>The Need For Leadership, Initiative, And 
Speed</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
Accountants, actuaries, economists, lawyers, financial officers,
and the leaders of our businesses, unions, associations, and the
media must assume a strong leadership role in forcing our government
to come to grips with its existing budget and revenue estimating
methodologies as they apply to saving.
<P>
Leaders within the private and non-profit sectors of our nation
have failed to seriously address this key issue of &quot;personal
saving&quot; that means so very much to the success of their work
and our nation.
<P>
These individuals, and the institutions that they represent, have
an enormous stake in making certain that remedial legislation
is enacted.
<P>
These people and institutions can have an enormous, positive influence
through personal conversations, meetings, conferences, letters,
newsletters, the media, talk shows, etc.  
<P>
It has been demonstrated in this analysis that universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs will provide, in aggregate and over time,
far more tax revenue for our government than can ever be derived
from the ordinary income tax treatment of saving.  The exciting,
dynamic financial aspects of such IRAs will add solid growth and
economic strength to our nation.
<P>
The existing methods used by the government for measuring the
IRA's impact on tax revenues are totally destructive.  Tax revenues
are shown as losses where, in fact, ever-growing real revenue
gains exist.
<P>
Because revenue estimates by government scorekeepers allege that
tax-deductible IRAs are billion dollar losers, Congress' existing
revenue neutrality requirements require an increase in taxes elsewhere
to offset the alleged loss from tax deducted saving.  Such erroneous
estimates, and related offsets, create fiscal chaos.
<P>
Huge amounts of economic growth have been, and will continue to
be, totally misdirected, curtailed, and wasted unless these existing
revenue estimation methodologies are completely changed.
<P>
Leaders of professions, labor, businesses, and associations must
lead their groups to demand corrective legislation.  Everyone,
including the government, will benefit.
<P>
<center><blockquote>ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO CREATE UNIVERSAL, 
UNLIMITED, TAX-DEDUCTIBLE IRAS, AS EMBODIED IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT

<h2><center><I><B>The Unlocking Of Fringe Benefit Handcuffs</B></I></center>
</h2>

<hr>
<P>
Our nation's economy is rapidly changing character as new businesses
emerge, older businesses down-size, global competition and opportunities
increase, and people become more independent and mobile due to
rapid technology changes.  This has direct and indirect repercussions
on employment practices, including employer-provided fringe benefits.
<P>
The legendary business analyst and writer, Peter Drucker, in a
recent article about existing employer fringe benefit plans, likened
them to the old fashioned &quot;company store&quot; where employees
were bound to employers, via the products, services, and credits
these stores provided.
<P>
Under today's economic conditions in a very competitive national
and global economy, employer fringe benefit plans have often become
the &quot;company store&quot; handcuffs that keep employees from
exploring new areas of employment.  This &quot;locking in&quot;
operates to the detriment of the employees' economic position
in life, as well as to the detriment of the employer and our nation's
economy.  Handcuffs can tie two people together even if both need
release.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can greatly change this
existing pattern of employer-provided fringe benefit plans for
the better.  And, there would be no need for government mandates
or controls.
<P>
For example, an employer could decide (and/or bargain) to replace
some part, or all, of its existing fringe benefit program by diverting
the costs of one or more of these plans into the employees' wages
or salaries.  The employees, as owners of unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs, would receive this welcome wage increase and, in turn, deposit
it within their unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Using his or her IRA, the individual could purchase fringe benefit-type
coverage(s) to fit his or her particular needs or desires.  By
allowing tax deductions for premiums and/or benefit payments paid
from the IRA, these tax effects could parallel those now found
under employer-sponsored plans.
<P>
Interestingly, the Administration's 1994 &quot;Health Reform Proposal&quot;
included a provision that premium payments made by &quot;self-employed&quot;
persons would be fully tax-deductible.  This is the same approach
that could be used when universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs
are used to replace an employer-provided fringe benefit.
<P>
Consider these advantages of an IRA-based, individualized, fringe
benefit alternative:
<P>
  It enhances an individual employee's personal responsibility
for himself and his family in many ways.  For example, some persons
may choose &quot;high deductibles&quot; and &quot;major medical&quot;
insurance, while self-insuring the less onerous, but administratively
expensive, costs of medical care.
<P>
 Other persons may want or need more or less life insurance than
his or her employer provides.  Some people may choose a long-term
sickness insurance program that's not otherwise available through
the employer.  Alternatively, too, the diverted wages can be saved
in the tax-deductible IRA without replacing the employer-provided
coverage, as might be the case of a young, single employee in
good health.
<P>
 When one considers that a 10%, 20%, 30%, and up, wage increase
can flow from such a basic change in employee benefit plan structures,
it becomes obvious that far more efficient wage/benefits structures
are obtainable without increasing the costs of doing business.
<P>
  In short, the use of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs as a means
to provide individualized fringe benefits is fiscally sound, very
flexible, and will be very attractive to many employees and employers
alike.
<P>
  Without question, too, the &quot;personal costs/benefits received&quot;
relationship between the IRA owner-buyer and the fringe benefit
provider will greatly enhance claims control and reduce the costs
of coverage.  Spending one's own IRA account money for &quot;coverage&quot;
and &quot;care,&quot; as contrasted with spending from an unlimited
employer or insurer fund, makes a very big &quot;cost control&quot;
difference.
<P>
  Employers may find it desirable to be relieved of the very heavy
burden of choosing, designing, administering, monitoring, and
paying for the plans they now offer.  The employer's overall costs
can be the same, but the diversion of benefit plan costs to wages
can be far more useful to the employee-and the employer.  Certainly,
the employer's &quot;benefit cost&quot; diversion to &quot;wages&quot;
creates a more controllable cost from both the employer and the
user perspective.
<P>
  Clearly, the existing employer-based structure to provide fringe
benefit plans has been stretched to the breaking point in many,
if not most, situations.  Most employers are, after all, in the
business of making products and services, not designing and administering
fringe benefits to fit each employee's particular needs.  This
is true of most all employers regardless of their size.
<P>
  IRA-based fringe benefits do not prohibit employers, unions,
associations, independent providers, such as insurers and Blue
Cross, etc. (or groups thereof), from offering plans to employees,
members, or individuals that will enable the employee (IRA owner)
to select the plan(s) that best fits his or her needs and desires.
 Such sponsored plans will be able to provide the discounts normally
associated with high volume business.
<P>
  Unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-based fringe benefits also help
solve the very serious problem of &quot;benefits portability&quot;
when an employee changes employers, moves geographically, and/or
retires.  Obviously, too, the universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
attributes of an IRA-type plan would greatly facilitate the personal
pre-funding of post-retirement coverages that are so vitally important
to our current and future senior citizens.
<P>
  There will be those in the government and in the private sector
who will claim that employees will wastefully spend the fringe
benefit costs diverted to tax-deductible IRAs.  However, people
need, and should have, the responsibility for their own actions-and
the vast majority of our citizens will welcome this.  There will
always be those who need help, but our localities, private institutions,
and charities are in a far better position to provide that help.
 This will be particularly true when personal saving is released
from the senseless bondage of double taxation.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs create a whole new environment
for imaginative, sound ways in which our citizens can personally
assume more responsibility and opportunity for their own current
and future &quot;financial&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; needs.
 These needs and desires embrace both a &quot;saving&quot; and
&quot;protection&quot; element that can best be decided at a personal
and family level.  And, of course, these needs and desires of
an individual, or family, will undoubtedly change over the years
as circumstances change.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type plans that can provide fringe benefits offer the maximum,
sound flexibility to meet these emerging changes from both the
employee's and employer's perspective.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs also provide each employer
with the opportunity to re-think the design of its fringe benefits
programs not only in regards to the company's objectives, but
those of its employees, too.  In contrast, replacing the &quot;company
store&quot; with the &quot;government's store&quot; for health
care coverage is a disastrous retreat from the sound, emerging,
very competitive trends of the future.
<P>
The attractive option of combining universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs with individually selected &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;protection&quot;
alternatives makes absolute sense.

<h2><center><I><B>Wealth</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
The word &quot;wealth&quot; has many connotations.  Too often,
financial wealth is interpreted negatively, thereby implying that
wealth is not desirable.  Or, that perhaps wealth above some level
is too much.
<P>
Obviously, too, financial &quot;wealth&quot; is easily interpreted,
as they say, in &quot;the eyes of the beholder.&quot;  Great wealth
to one person may be little wealth to another.
<P>
Regardless of personal feelings as to what is &quot;wealth,&quot;
from a financial perspective it is important for everyone to recognize
that savings, regardless of amount, are wealth.  And, having savings,
i.e., wealth, regardless of amount, is good for everyone-the person
who has it, those who use it directly or indirectly, and our nation.
<P>
We all prefer to live in a wealthy nation-and the wealth of a
nation is derived from the wealth of its people-not the other
way around.  The financial wealth of people can only arise from
saving (not consuming) and its fruitful use.  When people borrow,
they borrow someone else's saving.
<P>
Saving, and its growth, produces wealth.  Thus, it makes absolute
sense for governments-via their sovereign power-to encourage private
saving, and its growth, by every person.  Needless to say, for
our government to needlessly punish saving via the ordinary income
tax is crazy, self-defeating, and an abuse of power.
<P>
The growth of wealth invested via private enterprise should have
no bounds-for anyone-as amply demonstrated in this analysis. 
Government misconceptions concerning the taxation of wealth, and
its accumulation, must change-and change promptly-for everyone's
sake, including the government's.  
<P>
And, the accumulation of wealth (or its maintenance) must not
be constrained by notions that wealth existing at death above
some artificially set level must be captured by government (via
estate taxes, etc.), because the wealth is &quot;too high,&quot;
or because of some artificial notion promoted by some economists
of &quot;life-cycle&quot; taxation.  This usually means that if
the government didn't collect enough taxes while you lived, the
government should get the balance when you die.
<P>
From the government's fiscal perspective, with IRA-type saving,
death should be no more of a taxable event than an investment
transaction.  After all, inherited savings, i.e., wealth, will
continue to create production, jobs, rising standards of living,
more taxes, as well as prospective spending power for the owners
thereof.  Progressive estate tax rates applied to saving, like
the ordinary income tax, cut off the government's fiscal nose
to spite its face.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs avoid estate taxes through
the ongoing deferral of the income taxes on invested wealth. 
In due course, all withdrawals will be taxed at progressive income
tax rates.  This clearly maintains sound tax policy and accumulated
saving.
<P>
Wealth, small or large, is of great value to everyone, directly
and indirectly, including the government.  Certainly, to have
the government snatch away as an additional tax up to 55% of a
person's, or a family's, hard-earned investment growth (wealth)
at the time of death can destroy a lifetime of energetic, productive
work, and/or force individuals and families into nonproductive
(except to avoid the tax) tax avoidance methods.  The rational
taxation of saving, whereby the government maximizes its tax potential,
is to tax saving only when it's consumed.
<P>
<I>Unfortunately, the largest, persistent predator of wealth is
the irrational sovereign power of government.  Eternal vigilance
and diligence is required by each and every voter/taxpayer to
protect their wealth, and to nourish it.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>Family</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>

Personal saving is not just an economic matter for our nation; personal
saving helps build the strong sinews of family life. Family life is, and
should be, the strongest, most cohesive economic force within any nation. 
<P>
Parents, particularly, are always striving to better their lives, in no
small part in order to better help their children and other family
members.  The act of saving creates a storehouse of economic values for
future enjoyment or needs that can smooth and enhance family life. 
<P>
After all, our nation's economic strength and values must always represent
the aggregate economic strengths and values of individuals and their
families, not vice versa. 
<P>
Too often we have seen tax policy mistakenly curtail the individual's and
the family's ability and responsibility to accumulate savings. As a
result, without savings, individuals and families gradually, but
inexorably, become dependent on others or on the state. 
<P>
The ordinary income tax is the classic example of a slow, but
sure, progressive tax abuse of saving.  Other examples include
the misguided imposition of caps and limits on IRAs and on benefit
plans.  Such benefit plans provide advance funding and protection
against economic calamity.
<P>
Plain common sense and the traditional American drive for self-reliance
dictate that it is far better to permit individuals and families
to accumulate the maximum possible tax-deferred savings and investment
they can achieve.  People can better build their own lives and
protections without government interference or dole.  Not only
does this provide more freedom from economic fear, it adds joy,
purpose, and far greater economic health to everyone's life.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs provide each individual,
and his or her family, a far superior way to fulfill those innate
responsibilities to save and invest for their future needs and
desires.  These family needs, desires, and responsibilities are
intertwined among generations stretching over many years and should
not be curtailed by unwise taxation.

<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>in*er*tia <I>n</I> The tendency of matter to remain at rest, if
at rest, or, if moving, to keep moving in the same direction,
unless affected by some outside force.</blockquote>
<P>
Common sense, as well as sound economic thinking, tells us that
punishing saving by double taxation just doesn't make sense. 
In fact, it's stupid (i.e., foolish; irrational-as, what a stupid
idea).
<P>
If so, why do we, as a nation, do it?  First and foremost, the
answer is that you, yes you, (and I), tend to be content with
bitching, moaning, wringing your hands, and never taking any action
on your own to change the direction of such taxation;  i.e., you
suffer from inertia-as do we all.
<P>
<I>Let it be stated clearly:  no Congressman, no Administration,
and no &quot;staffer&quot; can properly defend the way our government
taxes saving.  So, we, individually and collectively, must assume
the responsibility to take action to force change.</I>
<P>
Every voter/taxpayer must have the gumption to challenge and demand
of their Representative and Senators a clear statement of their
position on S. 929 and H.R. 3179 (a description of the Individual
Investment Account Act is included herein).  This Act is simple
to understand and is positive legislation from every perspective.
 There are, of course, an increasing number of legislative proposals
that include among their objectives the removal of the double
tax on saving.  It is not the specific bill that's so important,
<I>the most important objective is ridding our economy of the
double tax on saving.</I>  The singular advantage of the Individual
Investment Act is that it is simple to understand and simple to
implement after the legislation is enacted.
<P>
There is no valid reason why your Representative and Senators
should not cosponsor S. 929 or H.R. 3179, and other bills that
move in this positive direction.  Strange as it may seem to you
(if you're not a salesman), legislators have to be asked.  No
legislator has the desire to deny his or her constituents (and
himself, or herself) the fruits of personal saving.
<P>
Up to now, most all legislators have been content to follow the
lead of others (principally staff) who proclaim that &quot;there's
a large revenue loss from tax deferred saving,&quot; or &quot;this
legislation is not the way we do it.&quot;   Legislators, by tradition
or inertia tend to merely accept these proclamations as immutable
fact without digging deeper.  
<P>
Every legislator needs your personal push (i.e., outside force,
see above) to start him or her moving in the proper direction
away from his or her own inertia toward swift removal of the double
tax on saving.  S. 929 and H.R. 3179 certainly pave the way to
do the job completely.
<P>
Your personal note (handwritten  is best) is what it takes.  Have
your spouse, friends, family, and associates write letters, too,
in their own style.  Keep a copy, and if you wish, send the League
a copy, too-we'll follow up.  Don't settle for a bland response.
 Insist on &quot;cosponsorship&quot; or a sound reason why not.
 Be persistent.  And, if you need to be, even a pest.  After all,
it's your money and your financial health that's at stake.  And,
you know-you'll win!  And, so will our nation, including your
children and their descendants.
<P>
<I>An unstoppable force will grow from your personal and business
letters, and contacts, as they add their weight to those from
others.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>Home Ownership And Life Insurance</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<I>Home Ownership</I>
<P>
Owning one's home has been a major objective for our citizens
and our nation for well over a century.  Not only has this proven
to be of economic value to all, it has helped maintain and nurture
family values that are so important to any strong nation.
<P>
And, as would be expected, home ownership has proven to be the
largest investment made by most individuals during their lifetimes.
<P>
All of this has been fostered by attractive tax laws that permit
a tax deduction for mortgage interest on this investment, as well
as permitting any gain in the value of a home, to be carried forward
without income tax for lengthy periods of time, including no income
tax on any gain upon death.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can further facilitate
home ownership in a very attractive, sound way from both the taxpayers'
and government's perspective.  For example, such IRAs could be
expanded to include an &quot;IRA/Residence Rollover&quot; provision
such as:
<P>
  Up to $15,000 could be withdrawn from a universal IRA without
any income tax, provided the sum is used for a first-time home
purchase.  Note, however, that the individual's basis in the home
would be reduced in like amount.  Thus, Uncle Sam's tax on this
type of IRA withdrawal is deferred, not lost.
<P>
  Upon the sale of the home, the sale proceeds could be rolled
over into the IRA without any income tax.  Note, however, that
the individual's tax basis on the home (including the $125,000
tax-free amount after age 55) is also rolled over into the IRA.
 Thus, the tax otherwise imposed on the sale proceeds is deferred
and not lost to the government.  In effect, the home seller exchanges
an &quot;unproductive&quot; asset (the home) for &quot;productive&quot;
IRA assets (investments).
<P>
Even though the government's taxes would be deferred via this
primary residence rollover option, the government would make money
on this program.  All withdrawals in excess of tax basis would
eventually be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and the individual(s)
would be giving up a stepped-up basis at death.
<P>
<I>Life Insurance</I>
<P>
A family that is saving and investing for life's later years is
always subject to the calamity of a premature death.  Investments
in life insurance (either term or cash value) should be allowed
in universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, provided the proceeds
are to be paid into the account, or added to a policy's cash value.
<P>
By fulfilling the family's funding objective, enhanced, tax-deferred
financial resources can be available over ensuing years following
the death of the insured.  These proceeds, like the other account
assets, would be subject to tax upon subsequent withdrawal.

<h2><center><I><B>The Social Security Trust Fund And Tax-Deductible 
IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
The Social Security Trust Fund can be compared to the proverbial
cookie jar into which mega-billions of excess Social Security
taxes are deposited, only to have these mega-billions borrowed
out by the government for the government's current spending, thereby
leaving the cookie jar filled with governmental IOUs.  
<P>
When baby-boomers retire and the so-called trust fund is diminished,
these IOUs must be redeemed in order to pay benefits.  Who must
then pay off these government bonds?-none other than baby boomers,
their children, and their grandchildren.
<P>
Haeworth Robertson, former Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration, states that:  
<P>
&quot;The government would have us believe that Social Security
is accumulating huge trust funds that will be used in the 21st
century to help finance the high cost of retirement benefits that
will become payable.  This simply is not true.  The present trust
funds, and probably the future trust funds, are mere window dressing
and have no economic reality.&quot;  (Newsletter of the Society
of Actuaries, September, 1992.)
<P>
Regardless of how Congress lowers Social Security benefits (e.g.,
increasing the normal retirement age to 70 or 75) and/or increases
Social Security taxes (Congress <I>must</I> take one or both of
these steps for Social Security to survive), the financial burden
of Social Security will always rest on the shoulders of the then-existing,
younger work force.  Such &quot;transfer payments&quot; from the
younger generation (and unborn generation) to the older generation
are a way-of-life that can not survive politically nor economically.
<P>
Unlike Social Security, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are fully
funded by investments in real income-producing assets.  The income
produced by those assets provides the benefits distributed to
the IRA owners, and the taxes on those benefits will more than
equal the compounded amount of the taxes deferred by the deduction
of the owners' contribution to their IRAs.  In contrast with Social
Security, the distribution of IRA benefits does not require taxing
our children's and grandchildren's income.  Universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, as embodied in Individual Investment Accounts,
can and must become the strong financial bastion for current and
future generations.
<P>
 
<P>
The financial soundness of tax-deductible IRAs rests on the solid
rock of free enterprise.  Unlike IRAs, the financial soundness
of Social Security rests upon the power of government to tax,
and to tax again and again.  Such taxation progressively weakens,
not strengthens, our nation and its Social Security promises.
<P>
There is no effective prefunding with Social Security; the system
merely collects and redistributes taxes.  No basic economic growth
is created from Social Security, as is true of tax-deductible
IRAs.  Individual Investment Accounts, as proposed herein, help
create and generate economic self-reliance.  Social Security does
the opposite.

<center><h2>"IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS</h2></center>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong>--- "At a time when the latest statistics indicate marijuana use among teen-<br><br>agers is up 37% and as we face a national crisis on drug abuse, Bill Clinton fiddles while Rome <br><br>burns talking about tobacco use," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. <br><br>Keene. "The way the Clinton Administration and its liberal allies portray it, tobacco is the greatest <br><br>scourge affecting children since the dawn of time and nothing short of a full-blown crackdown by <br><br>the Federal government can solve it. But the real problem is drug abuse and all its associated evils, <br><br>and the Clinton Administration has exhibited a scandalous indifference to the appalling increase in <br><br>illegal drug use."
<p>Keene noted that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services statistics released earlier this month show overall drug abuse among teens is up 78% between 1992 and 1995.  Marijuana use by teen-agers is up 37%, LSD use is up 54%, and cocaine use is up 166%.  He also pointed to a second new government report showing hospital emergency room visits resulting from marijuana abuse is up 96%.  Before Clinton took office, teen-age drug abuse had declined for a decade according to a third survey, conducted by <em>USA Today</em>.
<p>"What's really at work here is a cynical attempt to gain political mileage at the expense of addressing the real problem," Keene continued.  "The Administration, knowing it lacks credibility when it comes to waging the real war -- the war on drugs -- thinks it can cover itself with a phony war on tobacco.
<p>"As early as the 1960's and 1970's, the science was conclusive about the hazards of illegal drug use," Keene said. "But the then-youthful liberals who today occupy top positions in Washington, Hollywood and elsewhere ridiculed the dangers of marijuana and rejected society's disdain over 'hard' drugs.  They agitated to decriminalize marijuana cutlivation, possession and use.  They attacked, then as now, conservatives and other advocates of traditional cultural and moral values.  Today, as adults, they minimize and rationalize their own dalliances in the illegal drug scene.  For example, the President did not say that his own marijuana experimentation was wrong because it was illegal, or dangerous, or manifested anti-social behavior -- he excused himself by saying that he 'didn't inhale.'
<p>"No one, not even the tobacco companies, who are clearly on record about it, think it's a good idea for young people to smoke," Keene added.  "But the liberal establishment's election-year hysteria over tobacco is hypocritical in light of its record on illegal drug policy.  After all, the permissive social and political attitudes of liberalism gave birth to the drug culture.  Many liberals seem unwilling to offer more than lip service when it comes to fighting it and belittle those who try -- as former First Lady Nancy Reagan can attest from experience.  Should anyone take this Administration seriously in its 'holy war' against tobacco in light of disturbing reports of illegal drug use among the White House staff? What moral authority does the President -- a cigar smoker -- bring to bear? Why is the Administration bent on expanding government power and imposing new layers of regulation on the American people in this instance while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the critical problem of illegal drug use?
<p>"The American people should be asking tough questions," Keene concluded. "If the Administration should make a Federal case out of anything, it's national drug policy. Apparently Clinton has none, since the statistics speak for themselves. We therefore urge the Administration to wake up to the real and growing threat of illegal drug abuse and stop offering political sideshows to sidestep its real responsibilities."

<h2>FLAT TAX, SALES TAX, WHATEVER: FOCUS MUST STAY ON<br>
JUNKING CURRENT NIGHTMARISH TAX SYSTEM, ACU SAYS </h2>
</center>

<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--- "Some conservatives favor a flat tax, others support a national sales or
value-added tax, still others have different ideas on how best to pay for the legitimate
functions of government. The main thing is, we must not allow differences over those approaches
from causing the tax reform movement to lose sight of the real goal: elimination of the current
Federal income tax non-system, with its enormous bureaucracy, byzantine rules and regulations,
and abuses and outrages. That's why ACU is happy to join forces with those who also recognize
the importance of staying focused on the larger objective," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the
American Conservative Union (ACU), at a "Commitment to Tax Reform" press conference in
Washington, D.C., hosted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
<P>
     "This year's Tax Freedom Day- - May 7 - - was the latest ever," Keene continued. "When you
add in the hidden costs of government, such as regulations and other expensive burdens,
Americans must labor until July 3 before they're in the clear and able to keep all of what they
work hard to earn. That's an outrage to cause every American's blood to boil. The 105th Congress
cannot allow this level and scope of taxation to continue. The current tax structure is
hopelessly beyond repair and the only sane, fair thing to do is scrap it entirely.
<P>
     "ACU has already launched its own long-term project with the objective of abolishing the
IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized the Federal income tax. Yet that does not
mean we cannot join with our friends who argue persuasively for a flat tax in saying with them
that what exists now is a nightmare that must end and that the American people deserve tax
justice," Keene concluded. "The issue is no longer whether or not to end taxation as we know it,
but how soon we will get there. Once we get there, we may find that a flat tax is the way to go,
or that the best option is the national sales tax, or that some other approach is better.
Whatever the outcome, we simply must not lose sight of the objective, we simply must not let
Congress dodge the issue any longer, and we simply must make sure that the American people don't
stop pressing for reform."
<P>
     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots
conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters,
it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>ON TAX FREEDOM DAY, ACU URGES 16TH AMENDMENT REPEAL </h2>
</center>

<p>


 
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "It's Tax Freedom Day. Starting now, Americans can keep what they 
work so hard to earn after having spent the past four months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax 
bill," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. "With this year's Tax 
Freedom Day being the latest ever, the need for comprehensive tax reform has never been greater. 
That's why ACU is making tax reform its top long-term priority." 
<p>    Keene said that a cornerstone of the ACU effort will be a grassroot-oriented lobbying and 
public education campaign to rally support for repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which instituted the Federal income tax. 
 
 <p>    "Federal spending, the deficit, the national debt, and the growth of government have been 
spiralling out of control for decades," Keene said. "While the current Republican Congress has 
shown more determination to attack those problems than any in modern times, we have a liberal 
President who refuses to break with the past - - he vetoes every important reform and every 
serious attempt to bring needed change to the way Washington does business. Since the surest way 
to stop the big spenders is to not let them get their hands on the money, the current tax system 
has to go. The enormous tax-gathering bureaucracy, the byzantine rules and regulations, and all 
the abuses and outrages that go with it simply cannot be fixed. The slate must be wiped clean by 
repealing the 16th Amendment, and a sane, fair, workable means of paying for the essential 
functions of government should replace it." 
 
 <p>    Keene said ACU's strategy includes national "Town Meetings" on the tax reform issue, 
distribution of hundreds of thousands of citizen petitions to Congress calling for repeal of the 
16th Amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, direct lobbying of Congress, 
cooperation with public interest groups also interested in tax reform, and other projects. 

<p>     "The issue is no longer whether to drastically reform our tax non-system, but when," 
Keene added, noting that the issue was a major topic among GOP Presidential candidates and 
continues to rank high on the agendas of key Congressional leaders.  
 
 <p>    "ACU is preparing to buckle down for the long haul," Keene concluded. "We know it may 
take a few years for Congress and the states to complete the process of repeal and for a 
national consensus to be reached on a new and better tax system. ACU's job will be to help make 
sure that Washington does the right thing for the taxpayer, and we'll stay on the job for as 
long as it takes." 
 
<p>     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying 
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide 
range of issues before the Congress.

<title>WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?</title>

<h2> WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?<br>  
                    SURPRISE! IT'S TED KENNEDY </h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "Ted Kennedy built a career out of portraying every problem, however 
minor, as a crisis of mammoth proportions requiring immediate, massive government intervention. 
How ironic, then, that this same Ted Kennedy is the only one standing in the way of further 
Congressional action on S.1028, the health care legislation of which he is the chief 
co-sponsor," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Obviously, 
the Senator from Massachusetts isn't the least reluctant to fiddle while Rome burns when it 
suits his liberal political agenda." 
 
<p>     Keene referred to Kennedy's thus-far-successful parliamentary ploy blocking the 
appointment of Senate conferees on S.1028, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. Kennedy's 
delaying tactic is an attempt to pressure Senate leaders into not adding supporters of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs) to the proposed list of conferees. 
 
<p>     "Kennedy and his fellow ultra-liberals really aren't interested in true reform, which MSAs 
represent," Keene continued. "They only want to give the American people another dose of the 
same old Big Government elixir. They want to maintain government power and control, limit health 
care choices, and micromanage health care decision-making by patients, health care 
professionals, and the private sector. MSAs offer consumer choice, not government control - - 
and that is why the liberals oppose them. 
 
<p>     "In his vendetta against MSAs - - the most promising health care insurance reform idea 
proposed in years - - Kennedy shows he's all too willing to play inside-the-Beltway politics 
with people's health care. This is hypocrisy at its worst. The American people should insist 
that Sen. Kennedy either get on board for true reform, or get out of the way and let the rest of 
the American people's elected representatives deal with this issue promptly," Keene concluded. 
 
<p>     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots 
conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, 
it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>AX GAS TAX, ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "A few months ago, President Clinton admitted that he raised taxes too
much and that it was a mistake. That's all the more reason why he should start making amends
now by supporting the growing movement in Congress to repeal his unnecessary 4.3-cent
gasoline tax. If not, the least he ought to do is make a public commitment not to veto a repeal,"
said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. 
<P>
     "The current increases in gasoline prices stem from many factors," Keene added, "and as
the marketplace deals with them, prices will eventually decrease - - but only to a point. The
marketplace can't make tax burdens disappear. The public has been forced to get along with less
thanks to Clinton's various tax increases. ACU says it's high time government went on a diet,
and a good place to start is by junking the Clinton gas tax."        
<P>
     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots conservative lobbying
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies Congress on

<title>ACU Press Release - REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, 
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</title>

<h2>REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, <br>
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</h2>
</center>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "The tax-and-spend crowd couldn’t escape this time," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene, commenting on the tax limitation Constitutional amendment vote in the House of Representatives this week. "This was a real test of who wants to make it harder for the government to get its hands on the people’s money and who is a big spender. By and large, Republicans passed the test and the Democrats failed."
Republicans voted 219 to 24 to support limits on the taxes government takes. Democrats voted for business as usual by a vote of 160 against tax limits and only 16 for tax limits.
<P>
"All it takes is a simple plurality to raise taxes and increase spending," Keene said. "Because it’s so easy for Congress to spend other people’s money, that’s why we’re in the fiscal mess we face today. If Congress claims to be serious about getting taxation and spending under control, then it should be prepared to vote for serious measures to do that. The Tax Limitation Amendment was just such a measure. We’re pleased that it won the support of a majority in the House, but disappointed that it fell short of the necessary two-thirds. 
<P>
"We urge the American people to ask some tough questions of Congressmen who opposed this measure, to find out why they think it should continue to be so easy to tax, spend, run up the deficit and expand the national debt," Keene continued. "They also should ask these politicians, especially Democrats, why they insist on maintaining a tax-and-spend policy so out of control that Congress needs to pass a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Isn’t it more sensible to change that system so that we don’t have to pass laws to protect people from it?"
<P>


Keene rejected a chief argument of opponents that limiting the ability to raise taxes means   restricting the ability of Congress to use taxation as one way to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
<P>
"Too many tax-and-spend liberals think taxes first, spending cuts last - - if they think of spending cuts at all. If you give politicians easy access to the money, they’re going to spend it and then some. The answer is to cut off the gravy train. Americans already pay plenty in taxes. Even if Democrats and a few Republicans don’t get it, the American people do: cut government spending and stop raising taxes. The two go hand in hand. ACU will keep up the pressure and work to make sure that next time, there will indeed be enough votes to enact this important remedy," Keene said.
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the country’s oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization, with nearly one million members and supporters.

  By "lower," we do not mean "bad."  The bliss of marriage 
consists in part in the sexual union of spouses.  That union 
is, in the human species, elevated and inspired by the 
rational and moral union that married people enjoy.  A 
lifetime of commitment, chosen and not dictated by 
instinct, sustained by determination in the face of obstacles, 
is the specifically human satisfaction of human sexual 
relations.  In that context, the human family is a reflection 
of the divine nature of man.

Rights: The Regime of the 'Discrete and Insular Minority,'"

  A national marketing survey indicates that the average 
homosexual enjoys a household income of more than 
$55,400, a figure $23,000 higher than the average American 
household.  Homosexuals are far more likely to hold a 
college degree, and far more likely to work in a professional 
or managerial position than average Americans.  They are 
more than four times as likely to travel overseas, or to earn 
over $100,000 annually.  See "Overcoming a Deep-Rooted

opposed the Constitution as supported it.
  In his essay "On the Jewish Question," Marx had pointed 
out that progressive taxes can be used by the state as an 
effective means to abolish private property:  "when men 
strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, 
the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy 
religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish 
private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, 
or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds 
to abolish life, by the guillotine" (emphasis original).  Robert

  In 1927, the Progressive historian Vernon Parrington 
made this remarkable reinterpretation of the American 
Founding: "The substitution of 'pursuit of happiness' for 
'property' [in the Declaration of Independence] marks a 
complete break with the Whiggish doctrine of property 
rights that Locke had bequeathed to the English middle 
class, and the substitution of a broader sociological 
conception; and it was this substitution that gave to the 
document the note of idealism which was to make its appeal 
so perennially human and vital."  In the view of Parrington,

  She received $663 in cash from Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children (AFDC) and $139 in food stamps (Lance 
Izumi, ''Welfare in California: Too Much to Too Many," 
Claremont Institute Briefing #1992-19, October 27, 1992, p. 
3). The cash equivalent of her free health care was $450. 
(According to the California Department of Personnel 
Administration, the state paid $430 in 1992 to Foundation 
Health for HMO coverage for an employee family of three. I 
added $20 because Foundation coverage is more restrictive 
than Medicare and MediCal.) Her Section 8 housing voucher 
was worth $565. (According to HUD, the average one-
bedroom apartment in Los Angeles costs $704 in rent; I 
estimate $60 in utilities for a total of $764; a Section 8 
certificate is worth $764 minus 30% of cash income: $663 X 
30% = $199, and 764 minus 199 is 565.) Thanks to Jennifer 
Nelson for help with these numbers.

* Editors' Note: The idea for this appendix arose during a 
November 1992 segment of the television interview show, 
"Meet the Press."  Its purpose, like that of Appendix A, is to 
demonstrate that Bible-based religious faith is perfectly 
compatible with the principles and traditions of American 
democracy.  Indeed, it is much more so than the facile 
moral relativism of modern liberals.

<h3>March, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join The Heritage 
Foundation after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.<P>
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isn’t the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business community’s pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted us—so far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolution—focus and closure are critical.<p>

   <H1>McNamara's Anniversary Gift to Hanoi</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

<P>
The political leaders of Hanoi were assured a joyful 20th 
Anniversary of their victory over South Vietnam after 
unwrapping a priceless gift.  It was a retrospective book of 
our involvement in Southeast Asia, authored by former 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, in which one line 
takes precedence over all others:  . . .We were wrong, 
terribly wrong.

<P>
President Clinton, not unexpectedly, has praised the 
book and commended the “courage” it took to write it.

<P>
Don't for a moment believe that this is a book of self-
deprecation.  It is, instead, a book in which the author 
misses few opportunities to praise himself, even including 
a picture of a mountain he climbed in Wyoming.  He 
modestly concedes that President Johnson wrote in a letter 
that the President never liked or admired anyone more 
than Robert McNamara.  

<P>
It is written in the same kind of confusion in which he 
served as Secretary of Defense:  one sentence contradicts 
another sentence, one paragraph impugns another 
paragraph, one point is made with strength, and then 
nurtured with weakness.  Those with whom he worked, 
including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, are criticized 
and complimented all at once.  It appears to be his way of 
covering all bases.  Mr. McNamara even devotes one short 
paragraph in praise of the Americans who gave their lives 
in Vietnam.  (It's on page 333 for those who may easily 
miss it.)

<P>
He further writes  that “I do not know to this day 
whether I quit or was fired.  Maybe it was both.” Maybe.  
Everything seems to be uncertain.  Nevertheless, when all 
the contradictory points, incidents, and dialogues are put 
aside, McNamara clearly blames President Johnson for 
not accepting much of  McNamara's wisdom.

<P>
The book, by its own omissions, encourages the spread 
of an American amnesia, a disease with which President 
Clinton has already been stricken.  Robert McNamara 
stops his history when he departed his job, thereby 
conveniently leaving out the evidence that we were not 
“wrong, terribly wrong” in becoming involved, but instead 
that our Congress was “wrong, terribly wrong” during the 
two-and-one-quarter years after our military came home.  
Those two-and-one-quarter years have been wiped from 
America's memory as our amnesia makes us believe that 
when our troops left, Vietnam fell.

<P>
It was January of 1973 when our military engagement 
ended under the Paris peace accords in which both sides 
agreed to “be permitted to make periodic replacement of 
armaments, munitions and war material which have been 
destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cease-
fire, on the basis of piece-for-piece. . . .  North Vietnam 
replaced their losses on a four-to-one ratio rather than 
keeping the agreement of piece-for-piece, and the 94th 
Congress of the United States voted against supplying any 
replacements for South Vietnam's losses, stopping all aid 
of any kind to both Cambodia and South Vietnam, making 
defeat inevitable.  In April of 1975, both nations fell.

<P>
We signed those accords because Chapter Four, 
Article Nine of the agreement states that “the South 
Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political 
future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and 
democratic elections under international supervision.”  
Article Eleven stipulates the insurance of the “democratic 
liberties of the people; personal freedom, freedom of 
speech, freedom of the press, freedom of meeting, 
freedom of organization, freedom of residence, freedom of 
work.

<P>
None of this is recorded in the McNamara book, nor 
will President Clinton remind the American people of 
those accords when, as expected, he gives diplomatic 
recognition to a government that to this day refuses to 
keep its word on an agreement that was the very reason we 
left Vietnam.

<P>
By McNamara concluding the book where he does 
there is no mention of the horrors that came about when 
the communists won the war.  There is not even a footnote 
recording the over one million fleeing boat people, the 
genocide in Cambodia, or the post-war concentration 
camps in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The morality of 
what we tried to do has been proven by the immorality of 
the victors.

<P>
In the chapter entitled <B>The Lessons of Vietnam</B>, he 
generously sets in print his recommendations for future 
foreign policy.  With the depth of a single piece of saran-
wrap, we are told that we should achieve a nuclear-free 
world in which multilateral decision-making takes place 
within a burden-sharing context, while we assure 
preservation of the global environment.  That should work. 

<P>
It's entirely possible that waiting for Robert McNamara 
to mature may take more time than patience will allow.  It 
is my hope, however, that the time will come when  he 
will review what he wrote in the mid-1990s and conclude 
that his anniversary gift to Hanoi was wrong, terribly 
wrong.

<font size=3><b>The Impact Of The Ordinary Income Tax On Saving<br>
by <a href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a></b></font><br>
<hr>

<b>Executive Summary</center></b>
<P>
The financial strength of taxpayers at all economic levels, as
well as the financial strength of our government and our nation,
is being increasingly eroded year after year by the taxation of
private savings and investment growth.  A change from the ordinary
income tax treatment of saving to an expanded IRA-type tax treatment
of saving would benefit the economy, the taxpayer, and ultimately
the Treasury, too, by promoting higher rates of saving and economic
growth.  An example based on historical market returns on savings
will illustrate this fact.
<P>
Two taxpayers invested $100 of after-tax income in an actual mutual
fund on January 1, 1926.  Sixty-seven years later on 12/31/92
both taxpayers sold their fund.  This sixty-seven year period
included depressions, recessions, wars, and good times, too. 
This period also provides a reasonable illustration of what the
reward to saving might be in the many decades ahead.
<P>
Let's assume that one taxpayer, Larry Lo-bracket, was always in
the 15% tax bracket, and the other, Harry Hi-bracket, was always
in the 50% tax bracket (many, if not most, of those years had
tax brackets exceeding 50%).  On 12/31/92 Larry's $100 investment
was worth $57,708 and Harry's was only worth $9,195.  These compare
with values of $141,940 and $241,296 if Larry's and Harry's income
and investment <I>had not been subjected to the ordinary income
tax.</I>
<P>
In short, the ordinary income tax reduced Larry's otherwise invested
capital by 59% and Harry's by 96%!  Interestingly, Larry Lo-bracket's
loss was <I>four</I> times his tax bracket, and Harry Hi-bracket's
loss was <I>two</I> times his tax bracket!
<P>
In contrast, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, Larry would
have avoided the 15% tax ($17.65) on his income, and, thus, his
investment would have been $117.65.  Harry would have avoided
the 50% tax ($100) on his income, and his investment would have
been $200.00.  These larger investments provide the proper IRA
comparison with a $100 after-tax investment by each taxpayer under
the ordinary income tax.
<P>
Larry's <I>after-tax</I> value under the IRA-type plan on 12/31/92
would have been $120,649, <I>as would have Harry's.</I>  The $120,649
after-tax value for each man equals 85% of the $141,940 untaxed
value for Larry and 50% of the $241,298 untaxed value for Harry
(see above).  Larry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(15%), and Harry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(50%).  This is fair and proper taxation.
<P>
<I>As illustrated, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, both
men had the same after-tax value, $120,649, because each man's
out-of-pocket contribution consisted of $100, with the government
deferring its tax, i.e., $17.65 for Larry and $100 for Harry.</I>
<P>
Upon the IRA withdrawal on 12/31/92, the government not only recovered
its full tax deferral ($17.65 for Larry &amp; $100 for Harry),
it also enjoyed the entire untaxed, free-market investment return
on these tax deferred amounts.  While collecting the full free-market
growth on these IRA tax deductions, the government gave up the
yearly taxation of investment return and realized gain that it
would have otherwise collected under the ordinary income tax.
 <I>It is this yearly ordinary income tax on investment return
that punishes saving so harshly, and it is solely this second
layer of tax that is properly removed by tax-deductible IRAs.</I>
<P>
As illustrated above, each $100 of a taxpayer's IRA-type <I>net</I>
saving (i.e., <I>net</I> of the tax that's deferred) will enjoy
the same investment growth from the same investment <I>regardless
of tax bracket</I>.  This is so, because there is no further tax
on the <I>net</I> saving.  In short, this means that all of every
taxpayer's investment return and realized gain derived from <I>net
</I>IRA saving is received totally tax free.  This is sound economics,
as well as sound and fair tax treatment, because every dollar
of private saving adds equal economic value to our nation's success,
regardless of the source of the saving, be it from Larry Lo-bracket
or from Harry Hi-bracket.
<P>
The <I>new</I> saving generated by such a proper reversal of our
nation's existing and punitive ordinary income tax treatment of
saving will be very large and ongoing.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax destroys each taxpayer's investment
values that would otherwise be available for his or her own future
use.  The ordinary income tax also concurrently destroys the capital
available for the economy as a whole.  After all, capital saved
and invested by each taxpayer is used over and over again by others,
thereby generating more production, more jobs, and more taxes.
<P>
The negative bias of the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
has led to an increasing Congressional awareness that corrective
legislation must take place.  As a result, bipartisan legislation,
the Individual Investment Account Act, S. 929 and H.R. 3179, has
been sponsored in the 103rd Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA)
and Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA).  Briefly, this Act establishes
IRA-type accounts that permit-
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions by any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>No tax on the account's investment return or realized gain.<p>
<LI>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes
are paid solely upon withdrawals.<p>
<LI>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's
tax basis.<p>
<LI>Up to $15,000 of tax-deferred &quot;rollover&quot; for first-time
home buyers.  The tax basis of the home is reduced by the rollover.<p>
<LI>The proceeds from the sale of a primary residence may be rolled
over without tax into the tax-deferred IRA-type account, including
the $125,000 tax-free home sale proceeds after age 55.  The account's
tax basis is increased by the former residence's tax basis and
the $125,000 tax-free proceeds.<p>
<LI>The tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the
proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.
</UL>
<P>
These universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans without
penalty taxes and forced distributions will create such an upsurge
in new saving that any revenue loss will soon be outweighed by
the tax revenue gains arising from a greatly increased saving
rate.  Such increased saving leads to more investment, more production,
reduced costs of capital, more jobs, a higher standard of living,
and yes-more tax collections from sound economic growth.
<P>
The dynamic economic gains that flow from universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs can be measured in trillions of dollars of
increased GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  And, these GDP gains
translate into net dynamic tax revenue gains vs. the ordinary
income tax.  An appropriate report by the respected economics
consulting firm, Fiscal Associates, and included herein as Appendix
B, forecasts the static and dynamic economic results flowing from
the proposed legislation.
<P>
For example, three years after the adoption of universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, a healthier economy would bring in about
$17 billion in new federal tax revenue.  This would offset all
but about $10 billion of static revenue loss, as measured in the
erroneous &quot;tax expenditure&quot; manner utilized by government
analysts.  Within eight years, the real dynamic gains would (a)
fully offset the government's erroneous static revenue losses
and (b)<I> increase most taxpayers' after-tax income by approximately
15% to 20%.</I>  The bulk (85%) of this increase in after-tax
income would flow to taxpayers (including joint returns) with
adjusted gross incomes of under $100,000 per year.
<P>
Further, in a relatively short period of time (years 2000 - 2010),
annual GDP would be $500 billion to $1 trillion higher than otherwise,
thereby creating up to an additional two million more jobs than
otherwise.  Because of faster economic growth, annual tax revenues
would gradually grow each year to 30 billion dollars higher than
otherwise by the year 2010.  By the year 2060, GDP would be $32
trillion higher than otherwise and over 5 million more jobs than
otherwise would be created.
<P>
It is relevant to point out that the government relies upon its
staff-formulated &quot;static&quot; tax expenditure figures when
tax legislation is being considered.  This static tax expenditure
methodology is seriously flawed in that, among other things, it
ignores rational taxpayer reactions to tax law change.
<P>
Moreover, the government's 1995 Budget document admits for the
first time that the present value of its static IRA tax expenditure
figures for 1994 overstates IRA costs by over three times!  Thus,
it can be observed that not only is the government's static method
for measuring revenue loss flawed, the government's own numbers,
even using its own erroneous static method, are three times too
high!  In real life, the more realistic &quot;dynamic&quot; tax
revenue forecasts, as portrayed in this analysis, are superior.
 
<P>
Enacting universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans has
many very favorable, interrelated consequences for taxpayers,
our government, and our nation.  Similarly, there are often-heard
and generally superficial objections to expanding IRA-type plans.
These consequences and objections are addressed individually
and thoroughly in the &quot;perspectives&quot; section of this
analysis.
<P>
<U><I><b><center>Conclusions</I></U></b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving and investing
imposes enormous, ever-growing economic losses on our nation.
The net result is an ongoing compounding of economic injury to
savers, workers, users of capital, and the Treasury itself.<p>
<LI>The existing governmental tax revenue estimation methods that
neglect the dynamics of saving, and hence completely mismeasure
the tax revenue impact of tax-deductible IRA-type plans, are a
major driving force of our nation's erroneous tax policy as applied
to saving.<p>
<LI>The government's existing methods of estimating tax revenues
from IRA-type plans must be scrapped in favor of a more accurate
estimating process.<p>
<LI>The next sixty-seven years of savings and investment results
will have economic ups and downs not unlike the past sixty-seven.
Thus, the economic results, as portrayed in this analysis, that
flow from continuing the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
are a reasonable harbinger of a dismal economic future for our
nation if this irrational taxation of saving is not corrected
promptly.  On the other hand, tax-deductible IRA-type saving helps
everyone-including the user of capital, the government, and our
nation-not just the taxpayer.<p>
<LI>IRA-type plans must be improved, expanded, and promoted.<p>
<LI>Rather than limiting and discouraging the use of tax-deductible
IRA-type plans by taxpayers, the government should remove all
tax impediments to these plans and extol their use by everyone.<p>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving creates an ever-growing
atrophy of the economic strength of taxpayer/voters, the users
of capital, government, and our nation.  Expanded and improved
tax-deductible IRA-type plans will reverse this economic emaciation
and create sound, robust growth.

What should every schoolchild know about the history of this land of liberty we call America?  The National History Standards Project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Education Department, attempted to provide an answer to this
question; however, their report, released in late 1994, contains serious omissions and amusing political correctness.  In response, the Family Research Council prepared <I> Let Freedom Ring!, </I>an outline of U.S. history that avoids political fashion and emphasizes real knowledge of America's past.

   <H1>Hitler vs. The United Nations</H1>
   <h2>Liberty and the Bosnian Conflict</h2>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

Hitler was born sixty years too early to serve his ambitions.  Had he come to power in the 1990s instead of the 1930s, he would have won.

<p>
In the 1990s he would have been faced with the United Nations organization and the current leadership of the United States, and they would have offered little resistance.  I do not mean to suggest that they would have done nothing:

<p>
The U.N. forces would have stood at the railway stations, monitoring the families that were split apart among screams and tears.  U.N. monitors would also have stationed themselves outside Buchenwald and Dachau to monitor smoke when it was seen coming from the crematoriums.  But their orders would have been not to take a side in the conflict.

<p>
The United States leadership would adamantly oppose any aid to Great Britain on the grounds that it would "Americanize" the war, and the President would reject any weapons going to the underground movements in Europe, saying this would only "cause the death of innocent civilians."

<p>
In the 1990s the U.S. President’s foreign policy has turned the nation into a Maxi-Switzerland, with his perception of our military as little more than a uniformed Peace Corps.  But it’s not only the administration.  Prominent voices in the opposition party are saying that engagement in Bosnia would not be in our national interest.  Are they saying the prevention of genocide would not be in the interest of the people of the United States?  And both major political parties concur that we must not send in U.S. ground troops to help the 
victims of Serbian aggression.

<p>
Without the will, our power (if we still have it), means nothing.  Militarily, Rule Number One is never to announce what <i>will not</i> be done.

<p>
The larger tragedy of contemporary times is that the word "peace" is given more importance than the word "liberty."  As is always the case when peace takes precedence over liberty, neither are achieved.  It is only when liberty is paramount that liberty and peace can both be realized.

<p>
President Lincoln could have had peace easily, saving 500,000 American lives.  He could have done that by ordering U.S. troops from Fort Sumter and allowing South Carolina and any other state to secede from the Union.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt could have had peace if on the morning of December 8, 1941 he would have asked Congress, not for a Declaration of War, but for a Declaration of Accommodation with the Axis powers, as an Asian and European War would not be worth the death of one more American.  And we would have had peace.

<p>
President Bush could have had peace in this decade by allowing Sadam Hussein to keep his troops in Kuwait and to allow him entry into Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman.  Surely Sadam Hussein would have sold us oil as he would have needed the dollars.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
In all cases there would have been the peace of the slave for the many, the peace of the master for the few, and the peace of the grave for the rest.

<p>
As President Clinton rejects any troops to protect the Bosnian civilians, he does not rule out 25,000 U.S. troops to safeguard the U.N. forces.  Why does he care more about the uniformed who were misplaced there by the U.N. than about the civilians who were born there--or who went there to be in a U.N. "safe area"?

<p>
What should we do?

<p>
Ignore the U.N.  Lift the arms embargo.  And with or without NATO, bomb all military targets of the Serbs, including all missile deployments, all anti-aircraft sites, all roads, supply lines, bridges, and arms factories, whether in Bosnia or Serbia, all the way to Belgrade with no privileged sanctuaries.  (The lesson we should have learned from the Vietnam war.)  And we should be willing to send in ground troops if necessary after the bombing, and make our willingness known.

<p>
Why should we do this?

<p>
Because we’re alive at this time.  Our obligation as human beings is to stop the atrocities of which we once said, "Never again."

<p>
But we said that a long time ago.  It was, after all, more than a half century ago that Hitler encountered a difficulty too large for him to overcome. The difficulty was that back then there were leaders in the world who held liberty as the most cherished human right.

   <H1>Restoring  Conservative  Unity</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

The radical change of the 1994 election was produced by a unity of conservatives as strong as in the days of Reagan.  All the elements of the Reagan coalition functioned together magnificently in the congressional races and a forty-year lock on the Congress was broken.  Economic and social conservatives stood arm in arm.

<p>
Now, that harmony strains and threatens to break.  Last week, a long report on the <i>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour</i> presented a parade of conservatives chastising one another and threatening to break ranks.  Social conservatives threaten to walk away from the coalition if the moral agenda is not given priority.  Economic conservatives claim that religious zealots are attempting to control politics in the name of a faith they do not share.  Of course, the liberal journalist reported all of this with delight.

<p>
The correspondent for <i>McNeil-Lehrer</i> drew the obvious conclusion:  If this division deepens, the chances of the new majority will be ended.  Real reform requires an enduring majority, a majority broadly-based and stable over time. 	

<p>
The warning signs are then apparent, and we can avoid the danger they portend only if we recover the foundation upon which all stable majorities in America must stand.  That foundation lies among the simple truths that were the basis of our country at the beginning.  When our nation stood upon that foundation, no one divided the "economic" from the "social"  issues, and no one fought about the difference between them.

<p>
These simple truths are the central principles of our country.  They address themselves to our status as human beings and citizens, and cover all of our rights and all of our duties. Conservatives should understand that these principles apply just as much and in the same way to the economic as to the social issues, and just as much to the protection of the family as to the defense of private property.  

<p>
These truths receive their finest expression in the Declaration of Independence, where they are described as certain "self evident truths."  They stem from something called "the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God."  What are these truths, and what are these laws?  They have a lot to do with common sense.  They tell us that we are free and equal citizens.  They tell us that we are on the one hand entitled to our liberty and on the other responsible for our own actions.

<p>
First of all, these principles provide the strongest foundation in history for what we now call "economic liberty."  The authors of the Declaration and of the Constitution assert this belief with simple eloquence.  Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1812 that "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who...have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."  In the <i>Federalist</i>, James Madison writes that the "chief object of government" is to "protect the different and unequal faculties of acquiring property."

<p>
The right to property is then a sacred right, no less firmly established than the right to speak one's mind or worship God in one's own time and way.  The right to property gives a vital assurance that these other rights can be secured.

<p>
What do these principles say about the importance of moral behavior?  Consider the Virginia Bill of Rights and its assertion "That no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."  

<p>
A conservative movement built upon these ideas would then encourage moral behavior.  It would reform the welfare system for example, because it encourages young women to conceive children out of wedlock.  It would not tax more heavily those who are married than those who are not.  It should support the authority and responsibility of parents over children and the obligations of husband and wife.

<p>
A conservative movement united upon the ideas of the founding would also encourage religion.  George Washington affirmed the importance of religion during his farewell address when he said that "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports...reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."  

<p>
A conservative policy on religion would respect the freedom to practice any religion that encourages good citizenship.  It would not supplant the role of religious and other charities in social welfare.  It would encourage prayer in school and upon public occasions.

<p>
A conservative movement united under these policies would act under the principles of our founding.  It would adhere to the Constitution and those higher laws, the laws of nature and of nature's God, upon which that Constitution stands.  

<p>
Such a conservative unity can lead America from its troubles.  Such a unity can be built only by a people who know as well as Jefferson the meaning of their country, and who fight as bravely as Washington for its principles.

<CENTER><H3> End Federally Funded Abortion</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  There are 13 appropriations bills that fund U.S. government agencies and pro-grams.  These bills are voted on annually, and they originate in the House of Representatives.  During the Clinton administration, federal money has been used directly or indirectly for abortion through various appropriations.  The 104th Congress, however, has the opportunity to delete this funding or restore previous restrictions on tax dollars paying for abortion.  Also, the House Leadership has instructed the appropriations subcommittees to cut funding for programs that have not been "reauthorized" or approved by separate legislative committees.  For example, the Title X family planning program has not been reauthorized since 1985, but it continues to receive funding through the appropriations process.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee is Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA).  However, legislative action takes place first in various Appropriations subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the particular department or programs.  The sub-committee chairman plays a key role and can include the desired language in the subcommittee "mark", or bill.  A subcommittee version goes to the full committee for consideration and then to the House floor.  The key subcommittees and chairmen are:  Labor/HHS/Education (Rep. John Porter [R-Ill.]); Treasury, Postal Service, General Government (Rep. Jim Lightfoot [R-Iowa]); and District of Columbia (Rep. Jim Walsh [R-N.Y.]).
	<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Since the government's new fiscal year begins on October 1, these bills will be in the forefront during the next few months.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>The current Hyde amendment applies only to programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, such as Medicaid.  The Hyde language was "expanded" in 1993 to include payment for abortions in the case of rape and incest.  The fiscal year 1995 Labor/HHS bill contained this language.
<P>
<LI>A key issue to be decided will be language introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) that blocks the Clinton administration's interpretation of the "expanded" Hyde language.  Under that interpretation, the state pays for poor women's abortions whenever the abortionist claims the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Many states have stricter policies, allowing payment only in the case where the mother's life is endangered.  Rep. Istook tried to offer this corrective amendment during the "first 100 days" of Congress, but was persuaded not to and was promised a vote later in the year.
<P>
<LI>Also, attempts will be made to cut funding via the National Institutes for Health for human fetal tissue research, human embryo research, and RU-486 research.  Furthermore, Rep. Tom DeLay may offer an amendment to eliminate Title X family planning, which funds Planned Parenthood and distributes contraceptives to teens without parental permission.   The Senate Budget Resolution recommended defunding the Office of Surgeon General.  If the Appropriations Committee follows through, Dr. Henry Foster will have no job as Surgeon General, whether or not he is confirmed by the Senate. 
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 appropriations for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government did not contain language prohibiting participating health plans from paying for Federal employees' abortions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) program.  FEHBP provides health care benefits for 9 million federal employees.  The government (taxpayers) pays about 60 percent of the cost and the employee pays the rest.  In previous years, the Smith/Ashbrook amendment had been attached which restricted FEHBP-participating health plans from funding abortion.  This language should be reinstated.
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 District of Columbia appropriations contains a prohibition on the use of  "federal" funds to pay for abortions, which is meaningless, since DC can use "local"  funds.  These funds are commingled with federal funds since DC's funds are appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  Language is needed to ban all congressionally appropriated funds, both "federal" and "local," for abortion on demand in the nation's capital, a city where the number of abortions is comparable to the number of live births.
</UL><P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Majority support should be there for these appropriations bills in the House, but that will not be the case in the Senate.  In the first test vote on abortion in the House on May 24, the pro-life position (an amendment offered to the foreign aid bill by Rep. Chris Smith) prevailed by 59 votes.  President Clinton must sign the appropriations bills if he wants the money to run the government for fiscal year 1996.  

<P>
<LI><B> Prohibit D & X Abortions</B>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To ban a particularly heinous method used to perform late-term "partial birth" abortions carried out on unborn children as early as 20 weeks of gestation and as late as 32 weeks.   
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will introduce legislation in early June to ban "partial birth" abortions, or as they are more commonly known, "dilation and extraction" or "D & X" abortions.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on June 15 which focused on the D & X abortion procedure, fetal pain, and a constitutional analysis of the legislation.   
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  American Medical News, (July 5, 1993) devoted a front-page article to the gruesome D & X abortion procedure.  The article explained the step-by-step procedure.  First, the unborn baby's legs are pulled into the birth canal.  Next, the abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.  The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's head, inserts a catheter and sucks the brains out.  The dead baby is then "evacuated."  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  As a starting point, this legislation seeks to build public support for further prohibitions and an ultimate ban on all elective (non-life-of-the-mother) abortions.  While specifically intending to prohibit late-term abortions, this legislation and corresponding Congressional hearings will educate the public about the humanity of the unborn child and the horror of abortion.  Sadly, this basic public education is still greatly needed.  There should be widespread support for this measure, although some will argue that abortion is legal and that this is not a common procedure because late-term abortions are "rare."

<CENTER><H3> Retain Forced-Abortion Asylum Policy </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Language included in the pending foreign aid and State Department reauthorization bill (H.R. 1561) would reinstate a Reagan-Bush policy that provided asylum to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution for resisting the People's Republic of China's grotesque and coercive population control program. 
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) added this language to the foreign aid bill when it was before the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee in May.  Rep. Smith is the subcommittee chairman.  The provision remained intact throughout the full committee's deliberations and became part of the foreign aid bill, known as the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561), to be considered by the House of Representatives. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Col.) will likely seek to delete this key provision on the House floor when the House resumes consideration of H.R. 1561.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Despite fears by some anti-immigration groups that the number of immigrants entering this country will soar, it is important to note that from 1987 through 1993, when the forced-abortion asylum policy was in effect, less than 200 people per year were granted asylum on these grounds.  This is a humanitarian policy and should be reinstated.  President Clinton revoked this pro-life policy soon after he took office.  This policy has real implications for Chinese families living in the U.S. who face imminent deportation and persecution, if it is not adopted quickly.  On Good Friday (April 14), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) moved 13 Chinese women to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, Calif.  Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions.  Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortions and/or sterilization.  It appears that their deportation is imminent unless Congress passes H.R. 1561 with the forced-abortion asylum provision intact.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The anti-immigration lobbyists are stirring up some fears, but the fact that a militantly "pro-choice" Member of Congress (Rep. Patricia Schroeder) is their champion undercuts their ability to appeal to the pro-life majority in the House.  Rep. Schroeder will be hard-pressed to explain why she isn't more sensitive to the fact that Chinese women don't have any "choice" about abortion.  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto H.R. 1561 for other reasons, mainly because it significantly cuts foreign aid.  If the House cannot override the veto, Rep. Smith would have to find another vehicle to enact the forced-abortion asylum policy.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit </H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to reduce some of the financial obstacles associated with adopting a child.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit was a primary component of the House GOP's Contract with America.  The provision -- adapted from Rep. Chris Smith's (R-N.J.) Omnibus Adoption Act, H.R. 1066 -- was passed by the House as part of H.R. 1215, the tax cuts package sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and unveiled before an FRC audience.
<P>
<B> BUDGET RESOLUTIONS</B>:  In order to make the $5,000 adoption tax credit a reality, the provision must be included in the budget for each fiscal year.  The first step in that process is the budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for the appropriating of funds in the final budget.  The House recently passed an historic budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).  The resolution balances the budget by the year 2002, and includes the $5,000 adoption tax credit in its proposed tax cuts.
<P>
In contrast, the Senate's budget resolution would balance the budget by 2002 but failed to include the adoption tax credit (or any other tax cuts).  Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) tax relief amendment (which included the adoption tax credit) was defeated by a vote of 69-31.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House and Senate versions of the budget resolutions will now be melded together to produce one budget known as reconciliation.  It remains to be seen whether the $5,000-per-child adoption tax credit will be maintained in the final version.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  This provision would make adoption a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing them to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for quali-fied adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs, and attorney fees, among others.  This provision is important because it reduces the financial obstacles that might otherwise hinder middle- and low-income families from adopting.  [The average cost of an adoption is between $10,000 and $15,000.]  It is also an important step in encouraging the adoption choice -- a choice which benefits the birth mother, the adopted child, and the adoptive parents.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Much depends upon the reconciliation of the two budget resolution versions.  If the Senate and, most especially, the members of the House-Senate conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for the passage of the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
<CENTER><H3> Coercive Abortion Training Threatens Accreditation of Hospitals </H3></CENTER>
<P>
On February 14, 1995 the 23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents expressing moral and/or religious objections to abortion would, presumably, be able to opt out of the abortion training, but common sense suggests that they will face strong pressure to undergo the new "standard" training.  Medical schools with a religious affiliation that oppose abortion would not be required to provide abortion training directly, but they would be required to arrange for such training for those students who do not object.  Many religious medical schools currently reject any affiliation whatsoever with abortion providers.  
<P>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing their accreditation.   However, over the last 20 years, the number of medical schools offering elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In 1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either on a routine or optional basis.  In 1991, 68.8 percent of medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training.  About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or legal reasons. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to offer legislation in June that would reverse this coercive directive.  The legislation would "protect individuals, entities and programs from discrimination on the basis of their refusal to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training in the performance of induced abortion."  Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) is prepared to introduce similar legislation in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Oversight and Investigations subcommittee examined this issue during a hearing on June 14.  Witnesses included several medical directors of OB/GYN departments at public universities or hospitals who oppose the new requirement and a representative from ACGME.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Congressional action is necessary to reverse this coercive policy.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement (from Medicare and Medicaid) for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified as competent in their specialties.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Rep. Hoekstra's legislation may be attached as an amendment to health care legislation, such as the Health Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act.

</CENTER><P><CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Disestablishing the U.S. Education Department</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Education has been traditionally -- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.  But since the U.S. Education Department was founded in 1979, it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand its range and influence.  Legislation is needed to take educational decisions from the hands of federal bureaucrats and return them to parents, teachers, and communities.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 24, 1995, the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill was introduced.  This bill's main sponsors are Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), 
and John Boehner (R-Ohio).  Members of the House Education Task Force are among the cosponsors.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Within one year of passage, this bill would shut down the U.S. Education Department.  Many programs, including Goals 2000, would be repealed, while general funding for elementary/secondary and higher education would be converted to two block grants for the states.  The only stipulation is that 98 percent of a state's block grant be passed on to the local level.  Authorization for the block grants would last just three years, at which time the bill proposes that a tax cut for families replace the block grants.  A few functions of the Department would be transferred to more appropriate agencies:  Impact Aid to the Department of Defense, Indian Education to the Department of the Interior, Civil Rights to the Department of Justice, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and student loan programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.  The proposal goes beyond talk of shuffling offices and putting a new sign on the door; it takes a serious step towards removing the federal government from our schools.  The proposed tax cut would further reduce the government's influence over education.  Increased revenue for parents would empower them to make more decisions about their children's education.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  President Bill Clinton has already promised the National Education Association (NEA) that he would "remember who put me here."  He will clearly veto legislation that eliminates the NEA's primary representative in the federal government, the Education Department.  However, the executive office cannot authorize expenditures which have not been appropriated by the House.  The House Republican Budget Resolution zeroes out funding for the U.S. Education Department by 2002.  That improves the prospects for the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill.
<P>


<P>
<CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Repealing Goals 2000</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Ignoring parental pleas for education to get "back to the basics," the 103rd Congress adopted Goals 2000, a program which further centralized education, increased bureau-cracy, and added a host of new non-academic programs.  It was described by supporters as a new pattern for local-state-federal partnership in education.  The debate has now shifted to limiting the federal role in education.  Goals 2000, representing the height of federal intrusiveness into schools, should be the first program to be dismantled.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 10, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered an amendment in 
the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee to repeal Goals 2000.  The committee did not vote on the motion at that time, but Rep. Graham plans to raise the issue again later this year.  That same day, the committee voted in favor of H.R. 1045, a bill to abolish the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), which was created by 
Goals 2000.  Opportunities Committee chairman Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) is sponsoring the bill. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  H.R. 1045 was introduced on February 24, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House passed H.R. 1045 soon after the bill was reported out of committee.  Legislation to remove the opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards from the law may be introduced later this summer.  A bill to repeal the whole law should appear later this year.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  NESIC would have functioned much like a national school board by reviewing and certifying state and national standards.  There is a general consensus that this is an inappropriate function for the federal government.  OTL standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, which requires increased spending.  We know that spending does not drive academic performance.  OTL standards should be removed from the law.  However, the Goals 2000 agenda will carry on as long as block grants to states continue.  Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in American schools and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students the basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.     
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  H.R. 1045 should see minimal opposition, but the U.S. Education Department will fight fiercely to maintain its new conduit for imposing policy on the local school:  Goals 2000.  But the department is on the defensive.  Gov. George Allen of Virginia has announced that he will not accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  Across the nation, parents are outraged by the implentation of Goals 2000 in their local schools.  The U.S. Education Department's new partnership has turned against them:  it is being attacked from all sides -- federal, state, and local.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Promote Parental Choice in Education </H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  As evidence of the academic failure of our monopoly public school system mounts, legislation is needed to help parents choose a safe, academically successful public, private, religious or home school for their children. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) have introduced S. 618, a bill to spend $30 million on 10-20 demonstration projects.  It would allow low-income parents of students in inner-city schools to choose among public, private, and religious schools.  In addition, FRC is considering alternative legislation to grant a tax credit to parents who choose private, religious or home schools or who select a public school different from the one to which their children have been assigned. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  March 24, 1995 (Coats-Lieberman).
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Coats-Lieberman is in committee. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Sens. Coats and Lieberman offered this legislation in the 103rd Congress.  It was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year (52-41).  Their proposal has since gained the interest and support of prominent columnists, such as neoconservative Ben Wattenberg and E.J. Dionne, writer for the liberal Washington Post.  The purpose of the bill is to fund what are called demonstration projects.  Sponsors believe that when poor parents choose schools, the evidence we gain from this experiment will be so positive and so compelling as to clinch the argument for parental choice in education.  Because this bill would benefit low-income, inner-city students, who are disproportionately minority children, its backers believe that the idea will overwhelm the usual liberal case against parental choice.  Advocates of the public school monopoly generally argue that parental choice in education is elitist, that it will "re-segregate" the public schools, that private and religious schools merely "skim off" the best students.  Some pro-family advocates, however, argue that the Coats-Lieberman bill would expand the federal role in education at a time when the goal of dis-establishing the U.S. Education Department is a higher priority.  A better solution at the federal level may be tuition tax credits.  FRC is considering legislation which would allow all parents to retain a portion of their earnings for the purpose of selecting safe, excellent schools for their children.  This legislation would enable parents to select among public, private, religious or home schools.  It would protect the integrity of independent schools since there would be no cash transfer from the government to the schools. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Despite arranging for quality private schools for their own children, Bill Clinton and Al Gore will vigorously oppose parental choice legislation which includes non-public schools.  Coats-Lieberman therefore faces a veto threat.  Tuition tax credit legislation would face a gauntlet of liberal opposition and senators who stubbornly regard any family tax relief as a "giveaway,"  but it could benefit by being referred to a more friendly committee.

<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $500 Per-Child Tax Credit</H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to relieve some of the tax burden on parents.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit was an integral part of the American Dream Restoration Act, the "crown jewel" of the Contract with America, which passed as part of H.R. 1215 (sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer [R-Tex.]).  The credit is non-refundable (meaning that it only reduces taxes; it does not provide cash welfare to those with no tax liability).  This serves to target the bulk of the tax savings to middle-income families in the 15 percent tax bracket.
<P>
The House recently passed its fiscal year 1996 resolution, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), to balance the budget by the year 2002, and it includes the $500 per-child credit in its proposed tax cuts.  The Senate's resolution, though it also balances the budget by 2002, included no tax cuts, as Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) amendment to add the per-child tax credit to the budget resolution was rejected in the Senate.  It remains to be seen whether or not the $500 per-child tax credit will survive once these budget resolutions are melded into one budget by the two houses.   
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The fate of the $500 per-child tax credit is uncertain.  While Sen. Gramm's amendment to the budget resolution was defeated, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has indicated that he intends to secure a significant per-child tax credit in the budget resolution conference committee meeting with the House.  In addition, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) have pledged to offer amendments on the Senate floor calling for the $500 per-child tax credit if the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oreg.), continues to balk at offering pro-family tax relief.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  FRC has been calling on Congress to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average family of four contributes 25 cents on every dollar in income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government, compared to 2 cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of this, the per-child tax credit is designed to help offset the extraordinary erosion in per-child income tax benefits over the last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief should be a top priority in the ensuing months of Congress.  
<P>
Streamlining government spending and permitting families to keep more of their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the budget and make government more efficient.  In the months to come, it will be interesting to see if the Congress as a whole and the Senate in particular heard Americans last November and will give American families the opportunity to keep more of their own money.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  At this point, the fate of the per-child tax credit is uncertain.  However, if the Senate and, most especially, the members of the conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for passage of the $500 per-child tax credit.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Broaden IRA Eligibility to Non-Employed Spouses</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To help alleviate the financial burden on families in which one spouse stays at home.  Legislation to allow expansion of IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would help provide relief for families who choose to have one spouse stay at home and would recognize the important contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production of employed spouses -- an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce settlements.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Family Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1040), introduced by Rep. Bill Baker (R-Calif.), allows full-time homemakers and wage-earning spouses a deductible IRA contribution 
of up to $2,500 each; this was passed in the House as part of the Contract with America.  (Furthermore, this legislation permits families to borrow from their IRA for education expenses or to buy a home, with the provision that the funds be paid back to the family with interest.)  Similar legislation, the IRA Equity Bill (S. 287), has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) and allows deductible contributions of up to $2,000 by non-employed spouses.  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  It is important that the Senate pass legislation to help relieve the tax burden on families.  The House bill was passed as part of the Contract with America.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Along with the attractive idea of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free-up family finances (e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education, and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility of IRA's to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the eligibility of IRA's in general would primarily benefit upper-middle- and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily to middle-income families with children -- those most in need of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim almost twice the benefits as single-earner couples, penalizing those families who choose to stay home with their children and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker makes to the income production of the employed spouse.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief to American families.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle for IRA benefits for non-employed spouses must be won in the Senate, as pro-family House legislation has been passed already.  It is crucial that the Senate give priority to measures that promote pro-family tax relief. 
Support Medical Savings Accounts
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In the ongoing effort to reform health care, it is important to support any positive measures which would make health care more cost-effective for families.  Medical savings accounts, or Medical IRAs, are one such measure.  Making the option of medical savings accounts available to employees and unemployed individuals would encourage more prudent use of health care dollars and promote greater family autonomy in health care decisions.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Reps. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) have formulated legislation promoting medical savings accounts.  The proposal would amend the existing tax laws to create cost-effective incentives for employers to offer, and for employees to choose, medical savings accounts.  Rep. Archer expects to introduce his bill in mid-June and has said that many of his colleagues in the House have expressed great interest in cosponsoring such legislation.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The bill is currently being "scored" by the Congressional Budget Office to see what impact, if any, the reform will have on the overall budget, e.g., whether it is budget-neutral,  whether it will save money, or whether it will require the allocation of additional federal funds.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit may be set aside for lower-level medical expenses to be controlled by and used by families.  MSAs usually supplement catastrophic health insurance coverage, helping to cover medical expenses before the insurance deductible is reached.  Because individuals are directly responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, individuals reap the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of practicing good habits, for any monies not spent by the end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income, or kept in the account for future health care needs.
<P>
MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those not expressly covered within the insurance deductible, an individual has more flexibility to choose health services and providers and more portability of coverage (i.e., ability to keep coverage even when changing jobs).
<P>
Furthermore, evidence indicates that MSAs work well.  Golden Rule Insurance company recently conducted a survey of their employees who are covered under MSA plans.  The results show that (1) MSA enrollees saved money and reduced overall health care spending, and that (2) MSA enrollees were highly satisfied with their plan -- fully 88 percent prefer the MSA plan to other health insurance plans they had in the past.
<P> 
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The idea of MSAs is not new; therefore, many members of Congress are already familiar with and support the concept.  MSAs should have a good chance of passage in the 104th Congress, especially considering the fact that MSAs were a key component in many Republicans' health care reform proposals last year.

<CENTER><H3> Implement the Gay Ban</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved with the passage of a law.  Wrong.  The Clinton Administration ignored the law when it wrote the implementing policies and lifted the ban anyway.  Now, the Administration is using the courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a case that will lose in the Supreme Court.  That's why new legislation is imperative.
<P>
Pentagon and Justice Department officials have told FRC that what we thought was an exclusion policy is really an accommodation policy which permits homosexuals to serve.   So far, Congress has ignored this swindle by failing to exercise its constitutional responsibility to enforce military regulations.
<P>
The Pentagon policy that took effect February 28, 1994 differs in several ways from the law it purportedly implements:
<P>
<UL><LI>The law carries the statement, "homosexuality is incompatible with military service."  The Clinton regulations omit it. 
<P>
<LI>The law forbids service by homosexuals.  The Clinton regulations permit service by homosexuals.  At least 15 avowed homosexuals are now serving openly.
<P>
<LI>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.  But the Clinton regulations create a "criminal-like" standard.  According to Secretary of Defense William Perry, if soldiers attend gay pride parades, frequent gay bars, and possess gay materials, this does not constitute "credible" evidence to initiate an inquiry.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to 200 years of military experience and practice, Clinton's Defense Department no longer acknowledges homosexual behavior as a marker for increased security risk.  Information discovered during a security investigation cannot be used without high-level political permission.
<P>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation at the point of admission and whenever appropriate, the Clinton Administration refuses to do so.</UL>
<P>
In the first court test of the new law, the Clinton Justice Department failed to use key arguments and called no witnesses.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York ignored volumes of case law precedents and struck down the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  The case is<I> Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.
<P>
The Justice Department did not bother to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Dispute biased research and testimony by "expert" pro-homosexual witnesses.
<P>
<LI>Present well-documented physical and psychological problems with homosexuality.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual "lifestyles" and "values" jeopardize morale and unit cohesion.
</UL><P>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP), with senior advisors former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas M. Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert H. Barrow, is lobbying Congress to amend the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.  Should the <I> Able </I>case be heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before the law is changed, irreparable damage may be done.
<P>
FRC's MRP wants the following changes included in the 1996 Act:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to ask all potential recruits whether they are a homosexual or have engaged or intend to engage in homosexual acts.
<P>
<LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to revoke current policy and issue regulations consistent with the law.
</UL><P>
TheDefense Authorization Act will come to a final vote in early August.  Some members want to avoid another debate over homosexuals in the military and will try to torpedo any amend-ments.  However, without legislation the courts will have the final say on an issue which  constitutionally belongs to the Congress.  And the Clinton Administration will continue to keep more homosexuals in the military, thus undermining combat readiness, legal defense of the ban, and the moral fabric of the nation.  The stakes are extremely high.  If the military falls, federal power will be used to validate the rest of the homosexual agenda, including gay "marriage" and adoption of children.
<P>
Senators Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.) have both expressed concern and may take legislative action.

<CENTER><H3> Cable Porn</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Some cable TV operators include channels featuring pornographic material in their basic cable subscriptions.  This increases access to pornography, particularly by young people.    
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) introduced the Family Viewing Cable Television Act of 1995 (H.R. 1540) on May 2, 1995.  The bill forbids cable operators from including pornography in basic cable packages.  
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> H.R. 1540 is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee but no hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Currently, many consumers are forced to accept channels featuring pornography as part of their basic cable package.  This makes it more difficult for them to protect their children.  The bill would secure the right of parents to keep their television safe for family viewing.  It would not outlaw pornographic material on cable television.  Rather, the bill would merely prohibit operators from automatically including it in basic cable packages.  Consumers wishing to have pornographic channels on their cable systems would be free to do so, but they would simply have to request them from their cable company.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The bill is facing opposition from industry lobbyists and advocates of unrestricted free speech.  Supporters may offer it as an amendment to another bill if hearings are not scheduled soon.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Promote Porn-Free Technology</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The growth of technology has created many exciting opportunities.  Unfortunately, it is also being used to expand access to pornography.  Many on-line computer networks such as the Internet operate largely unregulated and are a virtual no-man's land where material is exchanged without regard to laws on obscenity and indecency.  Legislation is needed to bring computer networks into compliance with obscenity and pornography laws.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314) introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.)  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  February 1, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The bill has been incorporated as an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).  The telecommunications bill has been reported out of committee and is awaiting floor action. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Communications Decency Act amends current dial-a-porn laws regulating obscenity and indecency to include computer technology.  Without questioning Sen. Exon's intentions, many pro-family groups, including the Family Research Council, fear that the bill in its present form might actually create more problems than it solves.  Computer industry lobbyists have hit Sen. Exon hard, resulting in significant weakening of S. 314 since February.  FRC and other groups are working with Sen. Exon and other senators to develop a strong law that incorporates the original goals of  S. 314.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  FRC will continue to work with Sen. Exon to try to restore S. 314.  Meanwhile, several alternative proposals are in the works.  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to add an amendment to the telecommunications bill which would instruct Attorney General Janet Reno to "study" the problem of computer porn.  Sen. Leahy's approach is a do-nothing approach which pro-family groups will oppose.  If Sen. Exon's bill does not improve, parents might see help from Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) or Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who are working on solutions that are more in line with pro-family concerns.

<CENTER><H3> Military Profits from Pornography</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition for "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of Miller v. California.  At present, the services oppose removing so-called "soft" pornography from exchange shelves because of  the perceived threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
<P>
Obscenity was legally defined by the Supreme Court in the Miller v. California decision.  According to this ruling, something is obscene and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment when it satisfies the following criteria:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex.
<P>
<LI>Depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner.
<P>
<LI>Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.
</UL><P>
These criteria were written to protect freedom of speech and expression.  But there are kinds of speech and expression not protected by the Constitution: slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, copyright violations and child pornography.  The military has determined that certain "soft" pornographic material is protected (not obscene) and should be sold to uniformed patrons in government stores.
<P>
Pornography is sexually explicit material intended to arouse the consumer.  It is addictive and very often leads men to sexual crime.  This fact should persuade military leaders to judge wisely between two competing outcomes: the damage attributable to addictive pornographic material versus an ACLU lawsuit.  For now, the government is more fearful of an ACLU lawsuit.  
<P>
The government has much experience selling addictive merchandise to military patrons.  For example, it has sold alcohol, a potentially addictive substance, to servicemembers for most of the military's 200-year history.  Admittedly, most alcohol users avoid addiction, but enough do become addicts and they cost the services dearly -- productivity losses, personal injury, judicial expenses and property damage.
<P>
Pornographic material is much like alcohol; it is a very powerful stimulant.  The consumer begins with limited exposure -- "soft" pornography sold in military stores.  In some cases a  desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more explicit, more deviant images for the consumer to reach a previous level of sexual stimulation.  Gradually the addict is desensitized to the more explicit material.  Finally, he may act out sexually his pornographic fantasies prompted by the material.  These activities may include compulsive promiscuity, exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, having sex with children, rape, or sadism.
<P>
Serial killer Ted Bundy stated just before his execution for the sexual assault and murder of many women, "You are going to kill me, and that will protect society from me.  But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."  Bundy blames his addiction to pornography for his mental state that led to his murdering as many as 31 women.
<P>
No pending legislation mandates the removal of pornographic materials from military exchange shelves, but President Clinton has the unilateral authority to do so.  Military consumers can purchase the material without the government's help.

<CENTER><H3> Combat Illegitimacy in Welfare Policy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE:  </B> The current welfare system promotes family breakdown by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits even if one engages in irresponsible conduct.  Moreover, the bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer those benefits supplant voluntary organizations that offer real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.  Any legislation that attempts to reform welfare must end the entitlement status of numerous welfare programs, including AFDC cash benefits, and afford states the maximum flexibility to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral requirements (charitable alternatives, in particular).
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  House bill, H.R. 4, "The Personal Responsibility Act."  Senate floor action is expected.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  In March, the House passed The Personal Responsibility Act as part of its Contract with America.  The welfare reform bill will reach the Senate floor later this summer.  While the Senate Finance Committee did vote to eliminate the federal guarantee of cash assistance in favor of a strategy that "block grants" money to the states, the committee bill fails to ensure that illegitimacy remains a prominent focus of the debate on the floor.  The House bill, H.R. 4, included three essential provisions to strengthen families:  a prohibition on cash payments to mothers under age 18 who bear children out of wedlock; a freeze on benefits for mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and incentive bonus payments to states that reduce illegitimacy rates -- without increasing the number of abortions.  While the Senate bill does not include any of the essential provisions that were incorporated in the House bill, at least four senators have indicated that they will fight to restore the focus on family breakdown.  Family groups expect either Senator Bob Dole (R-Kans.) or Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) to lead the  initiative.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot be regarded as a morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to promote such activity by subsidizing it.
<P>
"The task," Charles Murray concludes, is to "neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else."  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, though not sufficient, to restore the integrity of the family unit.  
<P>
Frances Perkins, chief architect of Franklin Roosevelt's welfare policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member of the Roosevelt Administration, because they rejected that intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  While Congress is almost certain to pass a welfare bill this session, the fate of the illegitimacy provisions is uncertain.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Zero Out Title X</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning projects throughout the country.  The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental consent.  Having received over $193 million from taxpayers last year, funding for this unauthorized and failed program should be eliminated altogether.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act receives its funding through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes before Congress for a vote every year.  Neither the House nor Senate budget resolutions included a proposal to zero out Title X funding.  However, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) has promised to bring an amendment to the House floor to defund Title X if funding is not eliminated in committee.  Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and his state's Congressional colleagues, Reps. Ernest Istook and Steve Largent, are also working to zero out Title X funding.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> Efforts to defund Title X are in progress. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill will be considered by Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title X should not continue to receive funding because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired in 1985.  Secondly, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.  There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical family planning program when state governments have the capability to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative block grant.  Finally and most importantly, Title X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and sexually-transmitted diseases have all risen dramatically, especially in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Expect a huge fight pitting pro-abortion, pro-contraception groups intent on saving Title X against pro-family, pro-life groups working to defund the program.  Because Planned Parenthood receives a good portion of Title X monies, expect them to launch a campaign to save the program.  Outcome of a floor fight is uncertain.
<P>
Another approach, which may or may not prevent a floor battle, could be far more effective.  Overall grant reform may eliminate Title X funding without targeting any specific program.  For example, Congress could pass a law saying that no funds shall be appropriated to any program unless that program is currently authorized.  This is a justifiable reform in light of the efforts to balance the budget and the recently passed law eliminating unfunded federal mandates to states.  Thus, Title X funding might be eliminated on the basis of its unauthorized status.  However, if such grant reform passes, it is probable that pro-abortion members of Congress may try to bring Title X up for reauthorization.  Prospects to successfully reauthorize Title X are slim.  However, without such grant reform, funds could still be appropriated to unauthorized programs.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Derail the AIDS Gravy Train</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The federal government, all told, is spending $7.1 billion on AIDS through several government agencies in fiscal 1995.  The Public Health Service alone spends about $2.9 billion yearly ($91,355 per AIDS death contrasted with $1,060 for every cancer death).  Other federal expenditures come from HUD, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.  Legislation is needed to bring AIDS spending in line with money spent on other terminal diseases such as cancer.  And AIDS funds should not go toward the promotion of homosexuality in the guise of  "AIDS education."  Time-tested epidemiological responses such as early diagnosis and partner tracing should be employed.
 <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Congress seems prepared to take a business-as-usual approach to AIDS.  On April 3, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kans.) Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (S. 641) provides $4.3 billion over the next five years, beginning in fiscal 1996, and allows for "such sums as may be necessary," a budget-busting possibility.  Other sponsors include Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kans.).  A House version was introduced by Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) on January 4, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Senate bill was passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has put a legislative hold on the bill.  No hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Much AIDS money goes to legitimate activities, such as HIV research and care for AIDS victims.  A significant amount, however, goes to politically active groups that promote the radical homosexual agenda.  Congress needs to hold hearings to examine how the money has been used so far.  All funding to groups that promote homosexuality should be cut, leaving more money for groups that deal with AIDS in a medically responsible fashion.  Current AIDS education funding should be terminated, since the money is going toward promotion of condoms and the myth of  "safe sex" instead of documentably successful abstinence education.  And spending formulas should be changed:
<P><OL> 
<LI>Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive benefits.  Formulas based on "AIDS prevalence" distort funding needs, because they count the dead along with the living.  More of the money should go to under-served minority communities.
<P>
<LI>People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they currently live, not where they were diagnosed.  Someone might be diagnosed in a large city but return home elsewhere for care.
<P>
<LI>Means testing for AIDS dollars should be introduced.  Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with those who truly have no other means of payment.</OL>
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Fifty-five senators have signed on as sponsors, but hearings could result in positive changes.  Sen. Dole's role is pivotal if the bill's abuses are to be addressed.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Defund Federal Promotion of Homosexuality</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Clinton Administration mandated AIDS/Awareness Training for all Federal employees.  Some of this training is used to promote homosexuality.  Legislation is needed to defund this training.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS: </B>  S. 25 -- To stop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by government agencies to encourage their employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a legitimate or normal lifestyle.  Sponsor: Senator Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
<P>
H.R. 862 -- To prohibit the use of Federal funds to promote homosexuality.  Sponsor: Represent-ative Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.)
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  H.R. 862 -- was introduced February 8, 1995, and was assigned to the Subcommittee for Human Resources and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
<P>
S. 25 --  was introduced January 4, 1995, but is unlikely to be voted on until late summer or 
early fall.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Congressman Dornan's strategy is to amend all appropriations bills to include this language.  H.R. 862 will not likely be passed as a stand-alone bill, and thus, the Senate strategy is likely to be similar.
<P>
<B> OVERVIEW</B>:  President Clinton directed all federal departments to provide HIV/AIDS training.   According to many federal employees, the mandatory training promotes homosexuality and includes unnecessarily graphic explanations.  A Defense Department worker complained that her training included a slide show of  "sex toys" and flavored condoms.  Other workers were lectured that their grandmothers probably had engaged in sodomy as a form of birth control.
<P>
Two supervisors and 41 employees in the Federal Communication Commission's audio services division chose not to attend mandatory "AIDS Awareness Training."  An FCC employee stated, "The classes are basically an adult version of high school sex ed., with the modern-day sensitivity training thrown in."
<P>
Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary created "Walkin' the Talk" AIDS training materials for three-hour, mandatory training sessions.  A memo from the Department's Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator states, "All employees are required to complete this training."
<P>
The training includes a brief history of HIV and a discussion of symptoms, prevention, and risk reduction.  There also is a discussion of needle-sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing "safer sex" by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic wrap, and latex gloves.  The manual states, "A dental dam 
(a small, square piece of latex) or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact.  All types of barriers (condoms, dental dams, and plastic wrap) are effective against HIV transmission only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to finish."
<P>
The Energy Department makes a disclaimer: "HIV is transmitted without regard to gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or identification with any group.  For this reason, we avoid referring to high risk groups."  Not identifying "high risk groups" is irresponsible.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report shows that at least 87 percent of AIDS victims either contracted the virus from homosexual encounters or by sharing needles.
<P>
Probably the most outrageous example of government-sponsored AIDS training was done for the Forest Service.  It took place in the Forest Service's Tahoe Region on May 6, 1994 and was conducted by a local health official with degrees in sexology, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist (individual who draws blood), and an HIV-positive woman from the community.
<P>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk "homophobic" misconceptions.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when sharing hypodermic needles.
<P>
The Forest Service also has a training booklet entitled, "Valuing Diversity."  Inside the booklet are statements such as: "Fact: Psychological and social influences alone cannot cause homosexuality....Fact: A biological (genetic, hormonal, neurological, other) predisposition toward homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual orientation is present at birth in all boys and girls."  No source for these "facts" is provided, nor could there be.  So-called genetic studies on homosexuality are flawed and typically conducted by homosexual activists.
<P>
AIDS/HIV awareness training and diversity training have become vehicles for promoting homosexuality in the federal government.

<CENTER><H3> Restore Combat Exemptions for Women</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton administration has removed 250,000 combat exemptions for women.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The Administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness. 
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Perry promises, "Our over-arching goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.  By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility in the development and use of human resources."
<P>
The Clinton Administration has not explained how liberalization of the female assignment policy will accomplish the goal of maintaining "a high-quality, ready and effective force."  According to Mr. Perry, these changes are intended to expand "the opportunities for women in the military."
<P>
The Administration's decisions to end more exemptions for women have no justification in military necessity and will hurt readiness:
<P><UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient number of male recruits, especially now that the military is downsizing.  
<P>
<LI>No new scientific studies refute the findings of the 1992 Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended that "military readiness should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
<P>
<LI>The American people still support a go-slow approach to expanding military roles for women.
<P>
<LI>America's likely adversaries still assign only men to their militaries because they know that national security interests cannot be sacrificed to social experimentation.</UL>
<P>
On October 6, 1994,  Representative Ike Skelton (D-Missouri) of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel hosted the only hearing since 1991 to consider assignment policies for women.  Although Mr. Skelton began the hearing by stating, "Women should not serve in direct ground combat," and, "I'm of the opinion that second place does not count on the battlefield," he limited the two-hour hearing to one three-member panel which supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had asked to hear dissenting views from a panel of commissioners from the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.  His request was denied.
<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to "raise and support armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and their assignments.
<P>
The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to reverse the Clinton administration's current course.  No hearings or bills are pending.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Off The Dole: No Taxpayer Support for Special Interests</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In Washington, DC some of the most intensive lobbying is done by recipients of taxpayers' money.  Using the funds received from awards, grants and contracts, these government-created special interests lobby Congress for continued, and often increased, taxpayer support.  Moreover, many of the programs created are hostile to the values of the citizens whose money is used to fund them.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On March 3, 1995, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) introduced the Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), which would prohibit recipients of taxpayer money from lobbying for continuation of their funding.  The bill is currently cosponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Rep. Mel Hancock (R-Missouri).  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Integrity in Government Act is currently before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The bill is designed to keep taxpayer money out of lobbyists' hands.  It is carefully worded so that it applies only to lobbying for continued support of various programs and agencies.  It does not apply to recipients of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.   Nothing in the legislation restricts or interferes with individual citizens' ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  
<P>
The Integrity in Government Act does not have many friends among the special interest groups that are so prevalent in Washington.  Many Members of Congress do not want to support the bill for fear of the money and power of these groups or because they like the idea of taxpayer money being used to lobby Congress for causes they favor.  
 <P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Although no hearings have been scheduled for the bill, supporters say they want to move forward with plans to attach similar legislation to each appropriation and authorization bill that comes up in Congress.  It is believed that attaching such an amendment to each appropriation and authorization will make it more difficult for special interests to oppose efforts at reform.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Stem the Resurgence of Drug Abuse</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to the culture's pro-drug influence, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The Administration's national drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" --  treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress may cut drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership. 
<P>
A nationwide survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th (36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.
<P>
The largest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is perceived differently from the "hard" drugs.  Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a "drug,"  Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, "There is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does."
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, "Young people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects."  Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.
<P>
Shalala calls for "strong and comprehensive solutions....Young people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.  They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media -- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are o.k."
<P>
These strong words are not echoed by other Administration officials.  President Clinton has been virtually silent on the topic.  And his national drug strategy focuses on a new philosophy entitled "harm reduction," which provides and supports programs to reduce the danger of drug use-related risks, like HIV infection.  Needle exchange is a key component.  The strategy is geared at changing but not eliminating drug-using behavior, in order to reduce the threat of disease due to drug use.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration has cut drug interdiction efforts and increased efforts to treat chronic abusers.  The hope is that having more abusers in treatment will reduce demand -- a step toward ending the plague.
<P>
Unfortunately, the pop culture glamorizes drugs, and there are few alternative cultural icons warning teenagers to "just say no."  Additionally, there is no sign that drug production and distribution are declining.  In fact, there continues to be an ample supply.
<P>
The 104th Congress may cut school-based drug prevention programs believing they don't work.  There are some ineffective programs, but others have good track records and should be kept.  
<P>
The House rescissions bill (H.R. 1158) cut most of the FY 95 drug prevention money.  Pending legislation in the Senate may recover some of the funds.   
<P>
The national drug crisis requires committed parents and community leaders to join forces.  At the national level, leadership such as that provided by President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan is needed to curb the drug glamorization messages and boost effective prevention programs.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Free Public Broadcasting</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 during Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" to meet a perceived need for taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial networks.  Congressional authorization for CPB is due to expire at the end of 1996.  The 104th Congress should let authorization expire and decline to appropriate any more taxpayer money for CPB.  Instead of giving more taxpayer support to CPB, Congress should let it thrive on its own, as it has shown it can do.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) takes the first steps by providing a three-year phase out of funding for CPB.  The resolution passed the House on May 18 by a vote of 238 to 193.  A weaker Senate budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) was passed on May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42.  It includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Col.) to bring commercial sponsors to CPB in order to offset possible reductions in taxpayer subsidies.  The Senate resolution includes no explicit cuts in funding and falls short of the goal of privatization.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Budget resolutions in both houses of Congress provide a starting point for privatizing CPB, but more action is needed.  Budget resolutions are only suggestions for how to spend taxpayers' money.  Bills dealing with the appropriation of CPB funds will be making their way through the Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The CPB should be privatized for several reasons.  First, the federal government should not be in the broadcasting business.  The basis for CPB's existence is the assumption that for good television programming to exist, the government must provide it.  This $285.6 million a year, anti-free market philosophy insults the intelligence of the viewing/listening public because it assumes that they won't support good programming.
<P>
Second, CPB has been a regular launching pad for attacks on the family.  Independent Television Service's Television Families, Dottie Gets Spanked, and Terminal USA ridicule traditional families and glorify non-traditional households.  A PBS documentary What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children as young as 8 years old.  The role of parents in the education of their children as well as the moral and familial ramifications of sexuality are almost invisible.  PBS's Tales of the City and Tongues Untied are offensive and graphic promotions of the homosexual lifestyle.  Both programs contain gratuitous nudity, lewdness and foul language.  Religious bigotry is also common in CPB programming. National Public Radio's The Politics of Bigotry was billed as an "in-depth investigation of the Christian Right."  It was actually an ugly smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.
<P>
Finally, in a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars so that the government can run a television network that could survive on its own anyway.  As any family knows, serious budget cutting must start with non-essentials. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Defunding CPB is a priority for conservatives.  But these efforts are being met with stiff opposition from CPB supporters in both parties who argue that opponents are trying to kill "Big Bird."  It is hoped that the merits of privatization will drown out such scare tactics.

<CENTER><H3> Free the Arts and Humanities: Defund the NEA and NEH</H3></CENTER>
<P>

<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Over the years, a total of more than $5 billion in taxpayer money has gone toward the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  These federal agencies disburse millions of dollars each year in grants to institutions and individuals, most of which are not controversial.  But continued revelations of wasteful spending, public sponsorship of blatantly anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-business, pro-feminist and pro-homosexual "scholarly" projects and "art works" may finally motivate Congress to defund the endowments. 
  <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House Budget Resolution (H. Con.Res. 67), which passed 238 to 193 on May 18, provides no funds to either of the endowments.  A separate reauthorization bill, however, sponsored by Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Penn.), passed the Education and Economic Opportunities Committee on May 10.  That bill would phase out NEA and NEH by 1999 and is awaiting floor action.  In the Senate, the budget resolution sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Ariz.) would cut the endowments but not phase them out.  Senators Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kennedy, et al. have introduced S. 856, the Arts, Humanities, and Museum Services Act of 1995.  This bill would reauthorize both endowments.  Introduced on May 25, it was referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Most legislation on the NEA and NEH seeks to trim funding.  But merely reducing the budgets for the endowments would be breaking faith with American voters who want government to cut back on non-essentials now.  And leaving the endowments bleeding but still very much alive guarantees several years of shrill politicking by subsidy-seeking arts and campus groups.  It also ensures an easier renewal of spending if Congress falls back into 
liberal hands.
<P>
The NEA is budgeted $162.5 million in fiscal 1995 (down $4.5 million from $167 million because of an earlier rescission bill).  NEH is budgeted $172 million (also trimmed by $5 million from $177 million).  The House bill would also place a 5 percent cap on administrative expenses, thus gutting the Washington operations of the endowments, and send 80 percent of the grant money to the state arts councils in block grants.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  An attempt to zero out funds for NEA and NEH failed in the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee, which settled for the phase-out.  But the House Budget Resolution calls for no funding.  House negotiators will have to choose whether to do the right thing (zero out the agencies) or succumb to pressure from liberal colleagues and the more liberal Senate to retain the agencies in some fashion.  The latter course will earn budget cutters no love from the arts and humanities crowd, and will only ensure more conflict in the years ahead.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Religious Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Although the First Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the right to freely exercise religion, the ultra-broad interpretation of the provision prohibiting government from establishing a religion has nearly nullified the free exercise right.  A restorative amendment is needed to return to citizens their full First Amendment rights.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a coalition of congressmen and pro-family groups in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) may cosponsor the amendment.  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The amendment has not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Before any proposed language is introduced, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings around the country on the topic of  "Religious Liberties and the Bill of Rights."  The first hearing was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on June 8, 1995, followed by hearings in Harrisonburg, Va., Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, New York City, and Philadelphia.
  <P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The starting point for this legislation was H. J. Res. 424, introduced October 7, 1993, which contained the language discussed in the Senate during the Reagan Administration.  The premises upon which this effort is based include the following:  that a constitutional amendment approach is necessary due to existing court decisions on constitutional grounds; that participation in prayer should not be compelled; and that neither a moment of silence nor government-mandated language is acceptable.  While the language of the amendment is not yet final, it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other religious expression where non-religious expression is permitted, and from discriminating against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  This amendment will see heavy opposition from the ACLU and like-minded groups.  It is unclear whether the "super-majority" (two-thirds) needed for the amendment to pass is possible. 
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Parental Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Increasingly, parents' efforts to teach their children morals, values, and discipline are frustrated by government bureaucrats who claim a superior role in the development of the child.  A law is needed to restore to parents the right to direct the upbringing of their minor children without governmental interference.

<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are each drafting legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The bills have not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:   Both bills are on hold while the Family Research Council and other pro-family groups hammer out appropriate language.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Parental Rights Act is designed primarily as a response to parents' inability to control important aspects of their children's education.  The Act would, for example, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.   However, the Act not only protects parents' rights vis a vis education, but also prohibits government interference with regard to medical decisions for their children, reasonable corporal punishment of their children, and the direction of, or provision for, religious teaching for their children.   Some pro-life groups have some concern that the medical decision provision of the Act would prohibit governmental intervention in cases where parents attempt to coerce a daughter into having an abortion.  Similarly, there is currently some doubt as to whether the Act would indeed provide a counterbalance to privacy arguments against parental consent statutes, as it was originally envisioned.  The concept of statutorily restoring parents' rights is a good one, and, once the wording issues have been resolved, the Act will need support from pro-family citizens.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:	The bills will likely be introduced and debated this term.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation is a federally-funded program created in 1974 to provide poor people with access to expensive legal services.  In actuality, LSC serves as a deep well for anti-family litigation.  Each year hundreds of millions of dollars in legal services are donated to the poor from the private sector.  This $415 million a year pot of gold for the anti-family movement is not needed and should be abolished.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  There is no pending legislation dealing narrowly with Legal Services Corporation, but the House and Senate budget resolutions each call for rolling back LSC funding.  Thus, legislation which at least reduces funding of LSC is likely to come out of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees later this year.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Although there is no current legislation on LSC, pro-family groups, including FRC, are working on strategies for abolishing it.  These efforts include a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling for the defunding of LSC.  In mid-May, Sen. Phil Gramm's Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies held hearings on LSC.  Sen. Gramm pledged to fight the appropriation of money for LSC in the upcoming appropriations bill.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation has operated for 15 years without Congressional authorization.  Yet it continues to be one of the most powerful weapons in the anti-family arsenal.  LSC has played a major role in expanding abortion, divorce and the homosexual agenda.  It has spent $5 billion since 1974 on outrageous litigation ranging from providing cable TV for prisoners to forcing states to fund sex-change operations.  LSC has been a major combatant against welfare reform.  Supporters of LSC claim that it balances the scales in a system where poor people are at a disadvantage because of the high cost of legal services.  But state and local governments as well as bar associations and individual lawyers already provide a great deal of legal aid to the poor.  Instead of helping poor people, LSC often joins the efforts of well-funded anti-family groups such as the ACLU and the National Organization for Women.  Moreover, LSC lacks oversight.  According to Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) oversight has dropped significantly during the Clinton Administration.  Two years ago over 150 on-site audits took place, compared with fewer than 10 this past year.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle to defund the Legal Services Corporation will be a hard one.  Like many expensive government programs, LSC has appeal because it appears to help people in need.  Supporters will try to play to the public's sympathy for the poor, portraying those who want to cut the program as cruel.  But LSC's 21-year track record of radical anti-family activism will be brought to light during the debate.  Also, the deficit-conscious 104th Congress is more
likely to take a serious look at whether such programs are really necessary.

<img alt="Picture of Arlen Specter" src ="specter.gif"> </center><br>
Liberal Republicans in the Senate are at it again, doing their best to derail the conservative
revolution -- and if you don't call or write today, they'll get away with it!<p>

Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced and passed an appropriations
bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that reverses the hard-fought
gains we made during House consideration of the measure last month.  <p>

The bill as it came out of the House was the single most dramatic example of the conservative
revolution at work.  Among other things, the House version of the Labor-HHS appropriations
bill:<p>
<ul>
     <li>Ended welfare for lobbyists by placing new restrictions on taxpayer funding for political
     advocacy groups;<br>
    <li> Terminated funding for the Office of the Surgeon General;<br>
     <li>Ended taxpayer financing of abortions through Medicaid;<br>
     <li>Abolished the liberal Goals 2000 Program;<br>
    <li> Overturned President Clinton's executive order barring the use of striker replacements by
     federal contractors;<br>
    <li> Established tough new restrictions on the regulatory authority of OSHA and the NLRB.<br>
</ul>
But Senator Specter stopped the train in its tracks!<p>

Senator Specter -- who has a lifetime ACU rating of just 39, making him the 4th most liberal
Republican in the Senate -- decided to sabotage the work of his party's members in the House,
and refused to even consider any of these tough legislative riders.<p>

As you read this, the Specter version of the appropriations measure may already have passed the
full Senate -- but it's not over yet, because the two competing versions will still have to be
reconciled in a House-Senate Conference Committee.<p>

Call,  write or fax Senator Specter today, and let him know what you think of his arbitrary and
capricious decision to abandon his party's principles and support higher spending, more
regulation, and other failed liberal policies.<p>

You can reach him at:<br><br>

     SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER<br>
     530 Hart Senate Office Building<br>
     Washington, D.C.  20510-Concord, N.H. 03301<br>
     Phone:  (202) 224-4254   FAX (202) 224-1893<br><br>

Or, if you'd like, email your thoughts directly to the Senator at <a href="mailto:Specter@bizserve.com">Specter@bizserve.com</a>
<p>

Remember, it's not too late to act -- but to have an impact on this debate, you must call or write
Senator Specter today!<p>

Tell him you want him to support the original House-passed language in the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill.  Demand that he do his part to further the progress of the conservative
revolution, and overturn four decades' worth of failed liberal policies.<p>

Call or write Senator Specter TODAY and let him know just you think about his decision to
become a turncoat Republican.<p>

Together, we can fight Senator Specter's plan to let business as usual reign on in Washington. 
We'll keep putting the pressure on him here in Washington, but we need the help of good
conservatives like you to make it work at the grass-roots level.  <p>

So contact Senator Specter TODAY, and we'll be able to get a good, tough Labor-HHS
appropriations bill, like the one they originally passed in the House.<p>


Remember -- Senator Specter is running for President. If he has a campaign office in your state,
call there, too.<p>

FRC's staff of public policy experts -- and extramural family experts recommended by FRC -- are frequently called to testify before Congressional committees debating pending legislation or seeking guidance on vital family issues.  FRC also routinely submits unsolicited testimony to House and Senate Committees open to informed public opinion.  Topics range from the mundane and technical to the speculative and controversial.  Congressional testimony represents one of FRC's prime educational functions as a nonprofit organization located in the nation's capital.

<p>

Bruce Herschensohn has been a television and radio political commentator 
for the last two decades.  After service in the U.S. Air Force he began his own motion picture 
company and then was appointed Director of Motion Pictures and TV for the United States 
Information Agency.  During his tenure the USIA received more awards for films and television 
productions than all other departments and agencies of the U.S. Government combined, 
including the Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.  

<p>

In 1969 he was selected as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in the Federal Government.  He received the second highest civilian award, the Distinguished Service Medal, and then became Deputy 
Special Assistant to President Nixon.  His travels to over ninety countries gave him unique 
insight of world-wide political affairs.

<p>

Herschensohn taught "The U.S. Image Abroad" at the University of Maryland, and occupied the Nixon Chair at Whittier College teaching "U.S. Foreign and Domestic Policy."  He was Chairman of the Board of Pepperdine University, and was appointed a member of the Reagan Transition Team.  He was the 1992 Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in California and was defeated while winning over one million votes more 
than the national ticket of the Party. 

<p>

He is now a Claremont Institute Distinguished Fellow, and the author of numerous articles on politics and public policy, and the recently released book, <i>Lost Trumpets</i> (Claremont Institute Press, 1994).

   <H1>Transferring the USIA to the Department of Many Umbrellas</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>


<p>
The dismemberment of the Soviet Union has brought many in Congress to the conclusion that the United States can close or cut those foreign policy entities that took a lead role in the Cold War.  As a result, the United States Information Agency (USIA) may soon be slated for takeover by the U. S. State Department, with a commensurate and severe cut in the funds of USIA's radio arm, the Voice of America (VOA).  The VOA could then be virtually destroyed by the Chamerlainesque policies of State.  The hallways of the State Department are lined with dripping umbrellas, even when it isn't raining outside.

<p>
Is the USIA and its VOA still valuable with the Soviet Union gone?  Of course it is.  The death of the Soviet Union does not guarantee that democracy is the one and only outlook for Russia and other former Soviet Republics.  Nor does it mean that totalitarians around the world will applaud U.S. policy.  The VOA is the SDI of information.  Its stories about the United States have balanced the movies, rap songs, and gang activities which many citizens of the world would otherwise think consume this nation.  Its truth-telling of world news and events has encouraged the citizens of the world to accept nothing less than liberty.

<p>
On the sixth anniversary of the Tiananman Square massacre, the VOA's transmitters reached tens of millions of people in China despite their government's attempts at jamming it.  Would our State Department be so insistent?

<p>
When the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Ms. Saw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was released from house arrest this month, she told reporters that during those six years of confinement the VOA was her outside line to the free world.  Everyday at 6:00 PM she stopped everything to listen to its broadcasts.

<p>
The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahai's of the United States officially expressed its appreciation to the VOA for keeping the Teheran regime of Iran aware of America's commitment to the cause of the Bahai's human rights.

<p>
The representative of the Dalai Lama recently contrasted the truth of the VOA to the propaganda from the People's Republic of China media to Tibet.  He wrote, "The Voice of America's Tibetan Language News Service is the only independent source of news for the Tibetan speaking areas of the world."

<p>
What would our State Department say to Cuba, Burma, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Vietnam, Serbia, and Libya as it directs the Voice of America?  What would it say to Tibet?

<p>
There are areas of the USIA that I believe can be eliminated without risk.  The Fulbright scholarship programs should not be part of the workings of the federal government and the exchange programs should be served by private institutions.  But the USIA's libraries in 130 countries, its publications, its films and television programs and, of course, the Voice of America, are invaluable allies of those who want to know what the United States is all about, and what liberty is all about, and what truth is all about.

<p>
The 104th Congress is magnificently doing what has not been done since the birth of our nation. Its members, like our Founders, are acting against political nature by giving power to the states, the localities, and the people.  James Madison wrote that the federal government's duties "will be exercised principally on external objects," meaning foreign affairs.  The power now being surrendered by our federal government in foreign affairs will, of course, not revert to the states, the localities, and the people, as it will in domestic affairs.  

<p>
If the USIA is stripped of its influence, that power will not go to the people of California, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, and Delaware.  It will go to Kim Jong Il, Mu'ammar el-Qaddafi, Fidel Castro, Hafez al-Assad, and Deng Xiaoping.

   <H1>How to Beat the Supreme Court on School Prayer</H1>
   <H3>By Harry V. Jaffa</H3>

</center>

"We are a religious people, whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."

<p>
There is no better way to confirm the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William O. Douglas, 
than to take a tour through the state constitutions.  Forty-seven of the fifty states have preambles invoking the 
name of Almighty God.  A joint resolution of the Congress could declare that children in public schools might 
lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is 
present in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any of the other states.  When this resolution is 
signed by the President--and it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it--it could take effect 
immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution.  
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected branches of government, but also would 
require it, in effect, to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!


<p>
Consider the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental laws of the states:

<blockquote><i>We the people of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure the blessing 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and 
establish the following Constitution and form of government . . .</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We the people of the State of California, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and 
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted them 
to enjoy a free government . . .</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
This selection should be sufficient to illustrate the consistency in the patterns of all the preambles. Who could 
ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil 
and religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God to preserve and 
perpetuate it?


<p>
It is notable that the state constitutions have provisions equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice for present 
purposes is that of California:

<blockquote>
<i>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty of conscience does not
excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this it is apparent that the people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees of 
religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that 
freedom in the same constitutions.

<p>
American constitutions whether federal or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration of 
Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination of a legal positivism which is simply unable to 
understand the relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and human law on the other.  Yet 
this relationship was axiomatic for our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation--that 
is to say, a moral duty--to obey the laws, either of our State, or of the United States, there is only one answer.  
It is because those laws exist "to secure these rights," rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] 
Creator."  Constitutional governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights whose origin is 
altogether independent of human will, rights which are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God."  Through the ages many governments which did not respect the rights of the 
individual have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But the consent of the governed 
required by our republican constitutions is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human person.


<p>
Legal positivists deny to the Declaration any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according to the 
United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this 
is not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that every enabling act by the Congress for the 
admission of a State to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision.  


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>The Constitution of the State of ______ shall always be republican in form and shall not be repugnant to the 
Constitution of the United States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
It can be seen that the rights secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the United States, are 
means of implementing antecedent rights whose origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how we 
can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating in them an understanding of and a reverence for this 
origin.

   <H1><i>United States v. Lopez</i></H1>
   <h2>Restoring a Constitutionally Limited Government</h2>
   <H3>By Edward J. Erler</H3>

</center>

<p>
For the first time in more than sixty years, the Supreme Court has put restrictions on Congress' 
use of the Commerce Clause.  Under the Constitution, Congress is delegated the exclusive power 
to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the states.  Since the New Deal 
revolution, the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to regulate those purely state and local 
matters that substantially affect commerce between states either directly or indirectly.  


<p>
Accordingly, in <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i> (1942) the Court upheld a fine assessed against a farmer who 
planted 12 acres of wheat in excess of the allotment permitted under the federal Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938, even though the excess wheat was used only for private consumption.  
As the Court noted, the wheat supplied a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be 
fulfilled by purchases in the open market.  Homegrown wheat in this sense competes with wheat 
in commerce.  


<p>
In the intervening years, the Court has routinely deferred to the judgment of Congress whether 
the regulated activity, although on its face not obviously related to interstate commerce, 
nonetheless substantially affected interstate commerce.  The result has been a tremendous 
expansion of centralized federal power over the states.  


<p>
The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Lopez</i> signals that Congress may no 
longer have unlimited discretion to expand its power under the Commerce Clause.


<p>
At issue in <i>Lopez</i> was a challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a 
federal offense for any individual to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows is a 
school zone.  Almost all states have laws prohibiting guns in or near schools, and in the Lopez 
case a state indictment was dismissed in order for federal charges to be brought.  


<p>
Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 5-4 majority, declared the act unconstitutional because it 
neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be 
connected in any way to interstate commerce.  In oral argument, the government maintained that 
the presence of guns in schools so disrupts the quality of education that economic activities are 
affected.  Future citizens will be less educated and consequently less productive; the cumulative 
affect on the nation's economic well being will thus be  substantial.


<p>
The danger of accepting such a weak causal argument was pointed out by the Chief Justice.  It 
would allow Congress to regulate <i>any</i> activity that it found was related to the economic 
productivity of individual citizens; including family law (marriage, divorce, and child custody).  
Indeed, the Chief Justice rightly concluded that under the Government's theory it would be 
difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law 
enforcement or education where states historically have been sovereign.


<p>
The appropriate constitutional argument was detailed in Justice Thomas' incisive concurring 
opinion.  Thomas noted that in adopting the substantial affects test the Court has drifted far from 
the original understanding of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed, taken to its logical extreme, the 
substantial affects test would give Congress police power over all aspects of American life.  


<p>
Thomas notes that the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence comes close to turning the Tenth 
Amendment on its head.  The Tenth Amendment generally reserves the powers not delegated to 
the federal government to the states or to the people.  This is a confirmation of the fact that the 
Federal Government is limited to the exercise of constitutionally delegated powers or to those 
that are reasonably inferred to be a necessary and proper exercise of delegated powers.  


<p>
As Thomas rightly points out, the Commerce Clause that emerged from the New Deal revolution 
allows Congress to exercise all powers not specifically prohibited, thus reversing the federal 
relationship contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution.  The New Deal interpretation of 
the Commerce Clause was explicitly calculated to allow the federal government to extend and 
magnify the reach of its regulatory powers.  


<p>
<i>Lopez</i> is a welcome reevaluation of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, and it may 
well presage the beginning of a series of decisions that will reestablish the federal relationship as 
envisioned by the Framers.  The threat posed to the administrative state by the Court's decision 
may be gauged by President Clinton's frantic reaction.  Not only has the President severely 
criticized the <i>Lopez</i> decision, but he has also ordered the Attorney General to find a way around 
the ruling!

An Article By Gracie S. Hsu

<p>

Since joining the Family Research Council in September 1993, Gracie 
Hsu's research skills -- honed at the Johns Hopkins University -- 
have served as an asset to the work of the pro-family advocacy group's 
policy department.  In her current position as policy analyst, she is 
responsible for managing the Family Research Council's efforts in the 
fields of adolescent sexuality and life issues.  As part of FRC's 
outreach to the academic, media and legislative arenas, Miss Hsu's 
work consists of tracking, analyzing, and writing critical essays on 
new research, policy trends, and legislative initiatives concerning 
teen sexuality and abortion issues. She also represents FRC, 
explaining pro-family policy to audiences from capitol hill to the 
<i>CBS Evening News</i>. Her craftsmanship with the written word is 
a special skill she brings to FRC. As an op-ed writer, Miss Hsu 
(pronounced "Shoe") has been published in the <I>San Diego Union 
Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Orange County Register</I>, and 
other leading publications.

<p>

Miss Hsu began her work at the Family Research Council as a research 
assistant for health policy issues during the crucial first phases of 
health care reform.  Her project opposing abortion in health care 
reform contributed to U.S. Senate hearings on the subject. Prior to 
joining the Family Research Council, her research experience included 
work at Johns Hopkins on health issues and at the University of 
California at Los Angeles in a study of urban poverty.

<p>

Work in adolescent issues is also a task to which Miss Hsu comes 
well-prepared.  She served as a student health advocate under the 
University of California's Department of Student Health Services 
from 1990-1991, advising her peers on an individual basis regarding 
their various emotional and physical health concerns.  She also 
gained experience by participating in California's Watts Public 
Library Literacy Program, in which she worked as a tutor for inner 
city youth.

<p>

Miss Hsu graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with College Honors from 
the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English.  She went on to graduate <I>summa cum 
laude</I> with a Masters of Health Sciences degree from the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, 
Maryland.

   <H1>Fatherlessness</H1>
   <h2>The Central Social Problem of Our Time</h2>
   <H3>By Tom Lowe</H3>

</center>

<p>
For most of our history, a child growing up in the United States of  America could reasonably expect to grow up with a 
father at home.  Today, he can reasonably expect not to.  Fatherlessness is fast replacing fatherhood.  Never in our nation's 
history have so many men decided to abandon their children.  And never have the effects of that abandonment been felt so 
ubiquitously.


<p>
Divorce; child poverty; youth violence; the failure of education; unsafe neighborhoods; domestic violence; the weakening of 
parental authority--all are most directly attributable to the scourge of fatherlessness.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless 
America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in 
which their fathers do not live . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social 
problems."


<p>
Our ancestral understanding of fatherhood, which in many ways was responsible for early American success and survival, is 
under siege.  Men in general, but fathers in particular, are viewed as superfluous--America is now unable to believe in 
fatherhood as an inherent domain of males that absolutely effects the well-being of children and society.  

<p>
A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty.  In married-couple 
homes as of 1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty, while in single-mother homes an 
unbearably sad 66 percent of young children lived in poverty.  And consider that in married-couple homes with pre-school 
children, median family income in 1992 was approximately $41,000, while in single mother homes, median income was 
about $9,000.  America cannot address its child poverty problem without first addressing its most powerful determinant--fatherlessness. 


<p>
After protection and provisional responsibility, the central task of fatherhood is cultural conveyance.  As described in the 
Book of Genesis, paternity does not just mean males providing food and shelter for children, it also means that they ensure 
that the child grows up to be a <i>certain type of person</i>.  Biological paternity means producing a child--fatherhood means 
producing an adult.  For boys, the most insidious manifestation of fatherlessness has been juvenile violence, and for girls it 
has been out of wedlock childbearing.  


<p>
Studies show that girls who grow up without fathers are at much greater risk for early sexual activity, adolescent 
childbearing, and divorce.  Among white families, one study finds that "daughters of single parents are 111 percent more 
likely to have children as teenagers, and 164 percent more likely to have a pre-marital birth."


<p>
These studies also confirm that boys who grow up without a father at home are three times as likely to get in trouble with the 
police.  Historian James Q. Wilson reminds us that, "Neighborhood standards may be set by mothers, but they are enforced 
by fathers, or at least by adult males.  Neighborhoods without fathers are neighborhoods without men able and willing to 
confront errant youth, chase threatening gangs. . . The absence of fathers. . . deprives the community of those little platoons 
that informally but often effectively control boys on the street."


<p>
Frighteningly, an entire generation of young people is now growing up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or 
responsible males.  As of 1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, and in certain welfare-infested inner city 
neighborhoods over 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.  <i>Over 80 Percent.</i>


<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments to out-of-work mothers usurp a man's traditional role 
as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner unnecessary, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He 
turns to the super-masculine world of the streets:  drinking, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties 
that bind men to their children explains much of the rampant pathology from the city streets to small towns across America.


<p>
What is the solution to fatherlessness?  Laws strengthening the traditional family are part of the answer.  There should be 
firm public endorsement of healthy families, especially in textbooks written for schools.  Divorce should be made more 
difficult.  So-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our children’s well-
being.  State legislatures could reaffirm the value of two-parent families by passing laws to prohibit sperm banks from 
selling sperm to unmarried women.  The tax codes, which are unfriendly, if not downright hostile to families, must be 
changed to promote two-parent families and the raising of children at home.


<p>
As Blankenhorn insists, the most urgent social challenge for America as it heads into the twenty-first century is the re-
creation of fatherhood as a vital social role for males.  Does every child deserve a father?  The current answer in American 
society is "no" or "not necessarily."  The only answer that can save our children's future is an unabashed yes, but today, few 
ideas could be more radical.

   <H1>Imagineering a State Budget</H1>
   <H3>By Tom McClintock</H3>

</center>

In Anaheim, California, the creative technicians at Disneyland use the term, 
"Imagineering" to describe the process of letting their imaginations run wild and then 
trying to engineer fantasy into reality.  In Sacramento, California, the creative politicians 
at the Capitol use the term "budgeting" to describe a similar exercise.  The principal 
difference is that the Disney folks are good at it.

<p>
The Imagineers in Sacramento have once again produced a budget that fantasizes much 
higher revenues than the state will receive, much lower expenditures than the state has 
authorized, with virtually no budget reserve.  Thus, every miscalculation will 
immediately translate into red ink, piling on to the already staggering debt load 
shouldered by California's taxpayers. 

<p>
Since 1990, California's economy has significantly <i>under</i>-performed the rest of the 
nation--dragged down by one of the heaviest tax and regulatory burdens in the country.

<p>
Nevertheless, California's new budget is based on predictions of a miraculous economic 
explosion in 1996, including a 33 percent jump in building permits. 

<p>
Last year, California’s personal income grew only half as fast as the rest of the country, 
but next year, the budget requires an economy growing a 33 percent faster than the 
nation.  Last year, California’s employment grew at only one third the national rate.  Next 
year, it must grow 25 percent faster than the rest of the country.  Taxpayers will make up 
the difference between fantasy and reality.  Meanwhile, the budget counts on a $500 
million federal gift that Washington has not even agreed to give.

<p>
In their defense, Sacramento’s Imagineers are quick to point out that the budget’s 
economic forecasts are "mid-range estimates, when compared to other forecasters."  
That's an important distinction, since the "other forecasters" they use for comparison have 
been very good at over-estimating the state’s performance in past years.  Economists like 
Arthur Laffer, who have been consistently correct in predicting California’s economy, are 
far more pessimistic.  Laffer observes that California’s economy now drags along at the 
bottom of national numbers, on its way to becoming "perpetual West Virginia."

<p>
On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social 
welfare spending.  But there’s a hitch.  The cuts can’t take effect until waivers are granted 
from the federal government, or federal laws are changed.

<p>
Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a 
deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  That’s a very likely 
scenario.  The state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made last year.  The same 
imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit.

<p>
In addition, a number of court cases are pending against the state for past fiscal 
gimmicks.  For example, past budget games have shorted the state's pension system of 
nearly $1 billion. Court cases challenging state raids of this nature--which are part of the 
state's structural deficit--are very likely to add $2 billion to the state’s obligations, yet no 
reserve has been set aside.

<p>
A press release from the budget’s author boasts, "Without any gimmicks, tricks, or smoke 
and mirrors, the proposed 1995-96 budget is balanced and even has a small reserve of $41 
million."  "Small" is putting it mildly. It amounts to 95/1000ths of one percent of the 
state general fund.  The Imagineers may not have relied on "smoke and mirrors," but their 
new budget will only fly with ample quantities of faith and trust--and a little of Tinker 
Belle’s pixie dust.

<p>
The difference between the fantasy of this year’s state budget and the reality of the state’s 
ailing economy will be measured by a growing deficit that future taxpayers will bear.  
Meanwhile, the state continues to carry at least $2.5 billion of debt from past years, or 
about $300 per family, which California taxpayers must eventually pay. 

<p>
Kudos to those few legislators who stood in the face of intimidation and pressure to vote 
against this wasteful and irresponsible budget.  The fact that this year’s budget was 
passed by a bi-partisan vote should not be hailed as a breech in "gridlock".  Instead, 
support for this business-as-usual budget, which will continue to drag California to its 
knees, should be seen for what it is: a sad commentary on the quality of political 
leadership in California.

   <H1>What Welfare Should Be</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn & Thomas G. West </H3>

</center>

What should welfare be twenty-five years from now?  The current system and everything like it should be a faint memory.  In its place should be a system that is local in administration.  This new system must support family and work.  It must respect marriage, disdain illegitimacy, and distinguish the deserving poor from the pretenders.  It must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and 
organizations, in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy.  It must be fair and good.

<p>
During the 1960's, 70's, and 80's the public debate over welfare consisted mostly of money talk.  Can we afford welfare?  Who should have to pay for it?  Much, however, has changed over the past decade. Now, thanks to the accumulation of bad experience, and the clear heads of a wise few, we are reaching to the fundamentals.  We see now that a vast treasure of ill targeted relief has bought us only more misery.  We see that the poor have been hurt even more than the tax payer has been bilked.

<p>
Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per year; an increase of 750 percent.  The reasons for this dependency are many and complicated, but consider that in 1992, for example, a welfare mother of two living in California with a Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax amount she could have earned at a full-time minimum-wage job.  Why should she work when welfare prices work out of the market?

<p>
The percentage of poor Americans has not been reduced since modern welfare began in the mid-1960s.  On the contrary, these programs have in truth worked against economic growth and opportunity for the poor.  Before the big 1960s increases in welfare spending, the poverty level had actually been <i>declining</i> rapidly.  According to government figures, 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has stubbornly remained ever since.

<p>
The stubborn immobility of the poverty numbers is bad enough, but it is not the worst.  The nature of poverty has changed insidiously.  Prior to the 1960s, most poor Americans were poor because their work brought them a paltry income.  But since the middle of the 60s there has been a sharp and ominous increase of social pathology in urban, welfare-infested communities.  Poverty has increasingly become a problem stemming from a new underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  Many of them, especially males, reject the qualities that most Americans admire:  self-control, sobriety, duty to family, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.

<p>
The new underclass, mired in government dependency, rejects the ethic of hard work and self-reliance.  Low-paying jobs--where many Americans have traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time and getting the job done--are scoffed at.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as "chump change."  For this urban underclass, many of whom have spent care-free years not working, hanging around smoking reefer and drinking 40-ounce beers, the reality of trying to hold down a regular job is too much.  In this world, the drug dealing thug is lionized and the man who sweeps floors is scorned.  Welfare has taught our poor all the wrong lessons.

<p>
If today's welfare policies are not working, what then is the alternative?  Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago, at least 90 percent of Americans were desperately poor by today's standards.  By the 1960s a majority of Americans had moved into the middle class.  The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program was simple: 
<ol>
<li>Establish free markets and opportunity for all who can work.
<li>Provide strong governmental support for the traditional family and for a morality of self-control, industriousness, and basic decency.
<li>Provide individual support in local communities for the deserving poor (orphans, the elderly, and the disabled), and temporarily for the wayward able who desire to pull themselves out from poverty.
</ol>


<p>
Let us assume that the federal government is acting on the new prevailing intellectual consensus about poverty programs by handing over to states and local governments the authority to set and administer their own assistance programs for the poor.  With that in mind, here are characteristics of programs and ideas that can help in the transition away from the disastrous federal welfare state.

<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Political and community leaders should again talk candidly about virtue, vice and shame.</i></b></ul>

<p>
We know destructive and immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us and there is no reason to refrain from pointing out the truth.  One of the most frustrating problems in trying to resolve the current poverty question, as <i>Newsweek</i> pointed out in a cover story last fall, is the fact  that "shame" has all but disappeared from American society.  Thirty years ago, it was considered shameful to be on the government dole.  But beginning in the 60s, as Marvin Olasky points out in <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, the poor were taught by welfare organizers that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Before that, he says, poor mothers had  "a sense that welfare should be avoided."  But, "the constant repetition of <i>rights</i> got through."  The result was "a changing outlook among many poor and the near poor."  The deceptive notion that there was "dignity" in accepting government aid was widely promulgated in these years.  Accordingly, within a few years a much larger proportion of those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.  

<p>
When the stigma of accepting hand-outs is lost, so then is much of the self-reliant spirit it takes for people to pull themselves out of poverty.  Society must not be afraid to cast shame upon laziness, and leaders must affirm with renewed vigilance the duties and responsibilities of citizenship:  hard work, honesty, duty to family and self-sufficiency.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Understand that fatherlessness is the central social problem of our time.</i></b></ul>

<p>
It is in fact the key to solving poverty and crime problems.  While we know children do better with a father at home, and while it is damaging for a child to grow up without one, an almost incomprehensible disaster happens when an entire generation of young people grows up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or responsible males.  As of  1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, but in certain welfare-infested inner city neighborhoods 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.

<p>
The problem, however, has spread far beyond the inner city.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live. . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy. . . . A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty."  These studies indicate that in married-couple homes as of  1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty; while in single-mother homes a deplorable 66 percent of children lived in poverty.  

<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments usurp a man's traditional role as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner superfluous, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He turns to the masculine world of the streets:  drinking, gang banging, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties that bind men to their children explains much of today's rampant pathology.

<p>
Cash payments to underage girls who decide to have children without bothering to get married put the government in the indefensible position of encouraging reckless sexual behavior and illegitimate births.  Laws supporting family integrity need strengthening.  There should be firm public endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and mother raising their own offspring.  Divorce should be made more difficult; and so-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our children's well-being.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>A serious response to the crime that plagues poor neighborhoods is required forthwith.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the urban quagmire most poor now find themselves trapped in, there is a clear and present need for an efficient system of arrest, prosecution, trial (not plea bargains), rigorous adherence to stiff sentencing, a crackdown on youth violence, and imprisonment for the first violent offense.

<p>
The most pressing purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  That purpose is subverted daily and pervasively in every major city in America, where flagrant piracy is a way of life.  The law-abiding poor need protection more urgently than the law-abiding middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer neighborhood.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>The failure of public schools must be acknowledged and repaired.</i></b></ul>  

<p>
In the immediate term, tax credits or vouchers for school expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to private schools, something that is an affordable option today only for the middle class and the wealthy.  In the longer term, public schools need radical overhaul.  Control over schools should be returned to local communities, and large numbers of administrative positions should be canceled.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Private charity must be supported and not supplanted by the government welfare system.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the current "division of labor" in welfare, private charities provide few "on-line services," which means giving direct help to the needy.  That job is done by government.  Private action is forced to the sidelines, where it spends its time conducting experiments, running model programs, and giving expert advice to the government.  Private charity must be liberated so that it can flourish in America as it once did. We should invest private groups with the responsibility to do the main work in assisting the poor.  

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Separate the deserving poor from the lazy at the local level--make welfare less generous and 
more burdensome.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Olasky describes how local assistance programs in the nineteenth century separated the "idle" from the "truly needy" by using "work tests" to discern the character of those seeking assistance.  Charities and shelters had "wood-yards" attached to their property.  "Transients willing to chop were given two meals and a nights lodging."  Not surprisingly, a commentator in 1894 noted that, "when the managers of a Boston charity attached a wood-yard and announced that relief would be given to no able-bodied man, unless willing to do a certain amount of work, the daily number of applicants fell off at once from one hundred and sixty to forty-nine."  Today, and in the future, of course, the wood-yard would be some variance on "workfare," but the idea remains the same:  To provide basic sustenance consistent with the apostle Paul's common-sense injunction, that able-bodied men who do not work are not entitled to eat.

<p>
The first steps in replacing the welfare mess should focus on turning assistance into a temporary safety-net instead of the entrapping spider web it is today.  For instance, people in dire need whose families cannot help them should have to live in local communal arrangements, with requirements for long hours of work, and  with strict rules of behavior (no overnight guests for the unmarried).  Getting tough on dependency is the only solution.  Benjamin Franklin said of welfare, "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it." 

<p>
America needs to discover again, as we once knew well, that true compassion calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than as mindless children who will never grow up.

<font size=5><strong>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE TAXATION OF 
SAVING</strong></font><br>
<hr>
</center>
The Flat Tax (Dick Armey), The Sales Tax (Bill Archer), The USA (Unlimited
Savings Allowance) Tax (Domenici-Nunn), and The Individual Investment
Account Act (Breaux-McCrery)
<p>

All four revolutionary tax proposals have identical prime objectives:  (1)
totally <i>eliminating</i> the double tax on saving; and (2) greatly
<i>simplifying</i> the tax system.  These objectives are entirely proper
and achievable.  What it takes is sound judgment, good leadership, and the
guts to stop the "hand-wringers" from conjuring up ghosts that drag out
and obfuscates sound analysis and action. 
<P>
Appropriate comments follow.  But first, please recognize that
the League focuses on the taxation of <i>personal saving</i>.
Corporate tax changes, while relevant, are not commented upon herein.
<P>

<b>Flat Tax</b>:<br>  

We applaud it, because it totally removes the double tax on saving.  It
has undeniable attraction via simplicity. It is challenged by some,
because they claim it is less "progressive" than they prefer.  It suffers
due to the prospective elimination of tax deductions for home mortgage
interest, charitable contributions, and certain other embedded, existing
tax provisions. 

<P>
<b>Sales Tax</b>:<br>  

Again getting rid of the double tax on saving is a major attribute.  The
champions of the sales tax stress that it removes the whole income tax
structure and effectively removes the need for any IRS-with its legions of
tax collectors.  Further, the sales tax can be adjusted to correct the
present tax imbalance on foreign imports and exports.  Some commentators
fear that the sales tax will eventually evolve into a value-added tax,
with many levels of taxation that are masked from the public.  The sales
tax concept is simple, but faces a need for public acceptance due to its
perceived regressiveness.  The states, many who rely upon sales taxes, may
fight a national sales tax. 

<P>
<b>Domenici-Nunn (N-D) USA Plan:</b><br>

The centerpiece of the USA Tax is the Unlimited Savings Allowance from
which the new tax system for America's future derives its name" (4/25/95
N-D memo).  This plan has been endorsed by the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The N-D plan, insofar as the taxation of personal saving is concerned, is
virtually identical to in concept, and is derived from, the Individual
Investment Account Act.<p>

<b>The Individual Investment Account Act (S. 159 and H.R.
328):</b><br> 

Described by knowledgeable economists as ... "one of the boldest, most
imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth tax initiatives in many
years," this plan zeros in solely on the major fault with the existing
income tax system:  the senseless double tax on saving.  <p>

The simple, effective substance of this legislation creates an IRA-type
account for every person into which unlimited, fully tax-deductible
contributions may be made.  All assets accumulate on a tax-free basis. 
There is no penalty tax, nor forced distributions at any age.  There is no
income tax nor estate tax at death, and beneficiaries have the same tax
basis as the benefactor.  All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax
rates.  The net effect of this legislation is, like the other more complex
legislation above, a zero tax on <i>after-tax income </i> that is saved
and invested.  Additionally, this act provides a simple, most desirable
"home and account" rollover procedure that helps people not only purchase
their home, but also sell their home on a sound, tax-deferred "investment
transaction "basis.

   <h1>Tom McClintock</h1>

</center>
 
<p>

Tom McClintock serves as Director of Economic 
and Regulatory Affairs for the Claremont 
Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies 
in Sacramento.  He is the foremost spokesman 
in California on conservative fiscal policy and state 
government waste.

<p>

Mr. McClintock is the author of the most 
comprehensive survey of state government waste 
available and has published numerous articles 
on the state's finances. He is regularly quoted in 
budget and fiscal stories from Sacramento.  
Of his work, Dan Walters of the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> has 
written that Tom McClintock has "consistently 
been one of the very few legislators who's been 
right about what California is experiencing."  
In May 1993, Tim Ferguson of the <i>Wall Street 
Journal</i> observed, "Mr. McClintock remains 
about the only man in California who has 
consistently projected correctly the magnitude of 
the budget crises of the 1990s."  The <i>Orange 
County Register</i> said,  "Former Assemblyman 
Tom McClintock has consistently been among the 
most accurate forecasters of the effects of state 
tax and spending policies."

<p>

McClintock was first elected to the California Legislature 
in 1982 at age 26, and 
immediately earned a reputation as a freshman who 
was unafraid to stand up to legislative 
leaders.  Within two years, he became Assembly 
Republican Whip, a leadership position he held 
for five years.  In 1987 he jointly authored the 
Mello-Condit-McClintock Tax Rebate Act, which 
returned $1.1 billion of tax over-collections to 
the taxpayers of California.  In 1992, he authored 
California's current lethal injection death penalty law.

<p>

For a period of four years, beginning in 1978, 
McClintock wrote a newspaper column which 
he syndicated nationally in 1980.  From 1980-82, 
McClintock served as Chief of Staff to Senator 
Ed Davis.  He is a recognized expert in parliamentary 
law and is designated as one of the fewer 
than 2,000 Professional Registered Parliamentarians 
in the United States by the National 
Association of Parliamentarians.

<p>
Active in Republican politics since 1972, he served 
from 1973-1974 as president of the 
California Student Republican Organization; from 
1979 to 1981 as Republican County Chairman 
for Ventura County; and from 1985 to 1992 as Resolutions 
Chairman for the California Republican party.

<p>

In 1984, McClintock was named one of five 
outstanding young Californians by the 
California Jaycees and received the civilian 
Medal of Merit from the Ventura County Peace 
Officers Association for rescuing an elderly man 
from a condominium fire in 1985.  He has been 
honored by numerous taxpayer associations around 
the state for his leadership on state budget issues.

<p>

From 1992-1994, McClintock served as Director 
of the Center for the California Taxpayer, a 
project of the National Tax Limitation Foundation.  
In 1994, he overwhelmingly received the 
Republican nomination for California State Controller, 
narrowly losing the general election by one and a half points.

<p>

Tom McClintock and his wife, Lori, have two children, ages 3 and 5.

</CENTER>

<p>

	Charles Heatherly is the Executive Vice President of the Claremont Institute and also serves as Director of the Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies in Sacramento.

<p>

	He was born in Tennessee, raised and educated in Arizona, and has worked in Pennsylvania, California, and our nation's capital.

<p>

	He received his B.A. in government and history from the University of Arizona and his M.A. in government from the Claremont Graduate School.  He worked for non-profit educational organizations for fourteen years before turning to government service in the Reagan Administration.  He held three executive positions between 1981 and 1987, including Deputy Under Secretary for Management at the U.S. Dept. of Education and Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration. 

<p>

	He knows small business and its problems, and was for six years director of education for the nation's largest small business association, the National Federation of Independent Business.

<p>

	Heatherly has also been active in local government and local schools.  As a resident and public school parent in San Mateo County, California, he volunteered his time as a member of the Burlingame School District Budget Task Force.  He was also on the executive committee of the Governmental Research Council of San Mateo County.  Most recently, he served as Vice Chairman of the Dunfey Group, a statewide coalition of parents and community leaders advocating education reform through radical deregulation, parent empowerment, and independent charter schools.

<p>

	Prior to joining the Claremont Institute in 1993, he was Vice President for Academic Relations at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.  He edited the now-famous Mandate for Leadership, a blueprint for the Reagan Administration's first 100 days.  He also co-edited that book's sequel, Mandate for Leadership III, written for the Bush Administration.  In 1988 he was project manager for another pioneering Heritage Foundation book, the The Imperial Congress, which included an introduction by a little-known freshman congressman from Georgia, Newt Gingrich.

<p>

	He currently serves as Chairman of the State Policy Network, a federation of thirty state-based research institutes dedicated to free markets, limited government, and individual freedom.

Just prior to the 104th Congress, Catherine A. Deeds joined the 
Family Research Council in 1994 as a lobbyist to both the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her responsibilities 
include developing legislative strategy, meeting and working with 
key decision makers on Capitol Hill, and tracking current policy 
developments. With a broad understanding of the legislative 
process, Miss Deeds focuses on specific family issues that 
incorporate her policy skills and background.

<p>

Formerly a Legislative Assistant in 1993 for freshman U.S. 
Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Miss Deeds followed 
a number of domestic policy issues such as health care, labor, 
veterans, senior citizens, religion, and family.

<p>

Miss Deeds gained key legislative experience with family policy 
issues in several different arenas especially during a political 
appointment in the Bush Administration. In 1992, Miss Deeds 
assisted the management of the Office of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation in the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. She served as a liaison and political appointee 
in the Bush Administration to over two hundred Congressional Offices 
on public health issues.

<p>

On Capitol Hill in 1991, Miss Deeds worked as Policy Analyst for 
the House Republican Study Committee where she performed extensive 
research and writing on issues including health care, civil 
rights, labor, family, and education.

<p>

In 1989, Miss Deeds established her expertise on family issues as 
she served on a House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and 
Families. This position included not only the reporting on various 
topics affecting children and families but also the screening 
of witnesses for Congressional hearings.

<p>

From 1987-1989, Miss Deeds served at Free Congress Research and 
Education Foundation as Managing Editor of the monthly Family 
Protection Report and later, Associate Editor of the twenty-four 
page, monthly Family, Law & Democracy Report.

<p>

Cathy Deeds currently serves on the board of directors at a crisis 
pregnancy center and Advisory Board for American Collegians for 
Life, has volunteered for five campaigns for pro-life candidates, 
and founded the Arlington chapter of the Virginia Society for Human 
Life.

<p>

In 1986, Cathy graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Journalism.

</center>

Once a gladiator in the trenches of the National Football
League, now a pro-family advocate, Phillip V. Olsen joined the
Family Research Council in 1992 where he is Vice President for
Resource Development.  In his new capacity, the former professional
athlete directs his energies into marketing the pro-family, policy,
lobbying and educational organization.  As FRC takes its analysis
of pro-family policy to our nation's leaders and lawmakers, Mr.
Olsen and his Resource Development team broadcast the news about
FRC to its supporters nationwide.  His work involves the coordination
of resource development and grass roots networking as well as
the oversight of programs, activities and events that deliver
the message of FRC.

<p>

Mr. Olsen may be best known as a consensus first team collegiate
All-American Defensive End who was also a first-round NFL draft
choice in 1970. From there the two year All-American went on to
play nine years in the NFL, until his retirement in 1979.  A highly
decorated athlete during his athletic career, he was inducted
into the State of Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.  He was also
named to Utah State University's All-Century football team in
1993 and was inducted into it's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994.

<p>

As a concerned professional athlete, Mr. Olsen, and his brothers
Merlin and Orrin, originated and operated the Olsen Brothers All
Sports Camps throughout the western U.S.  He has also initiated
a number of student/athlete enhancement programs to promote athletic
and academic achievement. Mr. Olsen has continued his career
in sports through his work as a color commentator covering college
football on radio and as a member of the NBC TV broadcast support
team covering two Super Bowls and numerous other college and NFL
football games.

<p>

In business, Mr. Olsen has more than twenty years experience
in commercial/industrial real estate.  His experience includes
expertise in real estate finance, development, brokerage and investor
equity funding.

<p>

Active in community service, Mr. Olsen has served as chairman
of the NFL Players Association Men's Committee for Childhelp USA,
a national not-for-profit organization serving abused and battered
children.  He has also been actively involved with a number of
other charities and volunteer organizations such as Life to Life,
Sigma Chi Fraternity, the California Care Coalition, the Billy
Graham Crusade, &quot;Men at the Marriott&quot;, Friends of the
Family Research Council, and South Coast Community Church.

<p>

Mr. Olsen graduated from Utah State University in 1970 with a
Bachelor's degree in business and economics. He and his wife Connie
and their two daughters live in Maryland.

<center><h1>A NATION MOURNS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n April 10, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBA).  With a stroke of his pen, Clinton 
continued to authorize abortion on demand, leaving to the abortionist 
the gruesome method of his choice.

<p>

And gruesome it is. In a partial-birth abortion, a child between
five and nine months of gestation is delivered -- all but the head --
and living brain tissue is vacuumed out after the child is stabbed
at the base of the skull with surgical scissors.  A top physician
testified before Congress that babies subjected to this process
most certainly feel pain.  Strangely, if a &quot;mistake&quot;
were made and the child slipped out of the mother, he would be
legally human and fully protected from being killed.

<p>

<center><h3>Broad Support</h3></center>

<p>

The brutality of this technique seemed capable of delivering a
first -- the first federal restriction of abortion since the 1973
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> Supreme Court decision.  In fact, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) fought to keep pictorials of the procedure
off the House floor, but the pro-life side carried the day, winning
the votes of House and Senate members who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their careers.  Winning margins in the House were 288-139
and 286-129, and in the Senate, 54-44.

<p>

When the bill went to the White House on Good Friday, it included
an exception allowing the procedure if necessary to save a mother
whose life &quot;is endangered by a physical disorder, illness
or injury.&quot;  The bill also received important symbolic support.
Many national leaders called for the President to approve it,
including liberal columnists and prominent clergy.  Several Catholic
bishops, including two cardinals, endured a soaking rain on April
1 to pray outside the White House.

<p>

When Bill Clinton vetoed the bill, beside him stood five women
who had experienced troubled pregnancies.  The setting was designed
to suggest that PBA had been the only answer to their trauma.

<p>

But it was not even clear that the women beside him had undergone
PBA, according to transcripts of the President's remarks and
media accounts.  The President said, &quot;The emotional power
of the description of the procedure -- which I might add did not
cover the procedure these women had ... was so great ...&quot;
He also cited the bill's omission of an exception for the &quot;health&quot;
of the mother -- a term defined so broadly by the courts that, PBA
supporters say, it means unrestricted abortion.

<p>

<center><h3>Feeling Pain</h3></center>

<p>

Many myths have been reported as fact in the PBA debate.  Among
the cruelest is that anesthesia kills the baby before the procedure
is carried out, a falsehood that, dangerously, only scares many
pregnant mothers needing legitimate surgery.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
MANY MYTHS HAVE BEEN<br>
REPORTED AS FACT.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The decision on whether to attempt an override of the President's
veto rests first with the House leadership.  Since PBA began in
the House, the vetoed bill has been returned there.  If two-thirds
of the House votes to override the veto (a margin previously achieved),
then it would go to the Senate. The initial vote in the Senate
was short of the two-thirds margin needed for adoption.

<p>

The veto comes at a time when recent polls show that more than
two-thirds of Americans support either restrictions on abortion
or an end to PBA altogether.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who know that our nation
has more to offer than abortion,&quot; Family Research Council
President Gary L. Bauer said.  &quot;This is a time for us to
pray for the return of a respect for life, born out of our Judeo-Christian
heritage and honored by our nation's founders.  Our future depends
on it.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Write your member of Congress and two senators and urge them to
continue to press for enactment of the PBA.  Write or call FRC
(1-800-225-4008) and obtain a copy of our free packet (PK033) 
describing the truth about PBA's and the need
for federal legislation.  Thomas Jefferson once said that he trembled
for his country when he reflected that God is just.  A nation
that will not protect children (and mothers) at the very threshold
of birth has reason to tremble -- and to mourn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Omnibus Riders.</b> A new omnibus spending bill (H.R. 3019)
may include several pro-family provisions.  The Coats amendment,
which passed the Senate 63-37, would protect medical schools from
losing federal funds if they ignore an abortion mandate issued
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 
The mandate requires medical students specializing in obstetrics
to be trained in performing elective abortions.  House and Senate
conferees on the bill are also expected to maintain restrictions
on District of Columbia abortion funding and on international
population assistance to groups that perform elective abortions.

<p>

<b>Health Savings.</b> The House recently passed a health reform
bill (H.R. 3103) by a vote of 267-151.  FRC supported the bill,
which includes 100 percent tax-free medical savings accounts for
families and individuals.  MSA's allow working families to choose
their own doctors and make their own health care spending decisions.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole to include MSA's in the Senate
bill, cosponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), was defeated, 52-46, under a veto threat from President
Clinton if MSA's were adopted.

<p>

<b>Et Tu, Newt?</b> House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a speech
on March 24 endorsing a candlelight AIDS march that benefits pro-homosexual
organizations. Among them are the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which
treats AIDS victims but also runs homosexual activist workshops,
promotes lesbian parenting, and places &quot;safe sex&quot; ads
in a Washington homosexual newspaper that promotes strip clubs
and bathhouses.  The newspaper noted that Gingrich credited Rep.
Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) for asking him to publicize the march.
Gingrich also credited Gunderson's homosexual partner.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fda">

<b>Rubber Stamp.</b> After experimenting on 2,100 pregnant American
women, the Population Council recently filed a petition with
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for
the abortion drug, RU 486. FDA Commissioner David Kessler had
earlier suggested that the FDA would put RU-486 on a fast-track
review process, perhaps approving the drug within six months.
FRC condemns any action by the FDA that would legitimize, for
the first time ever, a drug that would have no other use except
to kill innocent human life.

<p>

<b>Fostering Failure.</b> Dr. Henry Foster, head of a new Presidential
teen pregnancy task force, appeared with several pro-teen contraceptive
advocates at an April 10 Capitol Hill briefing.  The panelists
criticized abstinence-only programs, despite their proven effectiveness
in reducing teenage sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases.
The panelists stressed instead more vigorous sex education programs,
increased use of contraception, and self-esteem programs. A hand-out
they distributed claimed that &quot;abstinence until marriage&quot;
programs and programs to produce &quot;secondary virginity&quot;
have not been shown to work.

<p>

<b>MIT Saber-Rattling.</b> On March 20, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology faculty task force announced that it wants to open
the college's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program to
avowed homosexuals.  The task force encourages universities nationwide
to rethink their relationship with the ROTC and their adherence
to its homosexual policy. MIT risks losing $56 million, 16 percent
of its annual research budget, because of a 1996 law that denies
Pentagon dollars to any institution that has an anti-ROTC policy.
Last year, ROTC commissioned 7,200 officers, barely reaching
the Pentagon's goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p><a name="marriage">

<b>States of Matrimony.</b> Kansas has become the fifth state
to enact a law protecting marriage, joining Hawaii, Utah, South
Dakota and Georgia.  Other states are also acting against an expected
Hawaiian court ruling that may legalize homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
licenses, which could then be imposed on other states under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In Hawaii,
the Senate also voted 24-0 specifically to ban same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; The vote boosts the state's case in the suit 
brought by three homosexual couples that triggered the controversy.

<p>

<b>Ornery.</b> The Republican and Democratic political establishments
were both thwarted by insurgent candidacies in the April 9 Texas
primary runoff.  Former Congressman Ron Paul beat incumbent Republican
Greg Laughlin, a recent party-switcher.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich
was among those who campaigned vigorously for Laughlin. Both
candidates had vied for the support of pro-family activists.  In
the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, school teacher Victor Morales
defeated veteran Congressman John Bryant despite Bryant's support
from former Gov. Ann Richards and labor unions, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers.

<p>

<b>Revisionists Revise.</b> Revisionist historians missed the
U.S. landing on the moon and the presidency of George Washington
in their first, politically correct attempt back in 1994 to devise
national history standards. Now the latest revision, just released,
re-defines the family as &quot;a group of people from whom we receive
love and support.&quot;  The standards also endorse President
Clinton's embattled Goals 2000 plan and, for good measure, put
in a plug for equalized school funding nationwide.  Some conservative
critics were assuaged, but the standards remain a biased political
document.

<h3>Implementing Beijing</h3>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have
children at some point in their lives, the family remained a non-issue
at the 40th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status
of Women (CSW) which met in New York in mid-March.  The CSW is
planning the implementation of the Platform for Action of last
autumn's Beijing Women's Conference.

<p>

There was no statement at the session that the family had
value, no effort to protect or shore it up now that it is under
siege, not even an invocation of the UN's usual definition of
the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot; 

<p>

Most of the meeting revolved about the issues of &quot;women
and poverty&quot; and &quot;women and child and dependent care.&quot;
Noting that women constitute the majority of the world's poor,
the Commission urged governments to undertake education and training
programs and to adopt legislation promoting women's rights to
inheritance, land ownership and political decision-making.  The
&quot;dependent care&quot; debate urged redistribution of responsibilities
in the home and more part-time work, child care services and elder
care.

<p>

The session ended with the adoption of strong resolutions
condemning traffic in women and girls (a growing problem especially
in some developing countries) and wartime violence against civilians.
The Commission also approved the UN's System-Wide Plan of Action
(known as SWIMTEP) for implementing the Beijing Platform, including
its controversial provisions for health and &quot;reproductive
rights,&quot; which many UN advocacy groups hold to include abortion
and contraceptive programs for girls.

<p>

Among the tasks which SWIMTEP assigned regarding reproductive
rights were: a directive for the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF and UNESCO to report on promotion of these rights to the
UN Population Division; a directive to the WHO 
and the UN Fund for Population to provide governments with technical
guidelines on methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives; and a directive to UN agencies to provide special
programs for youth regarding sexual behavior.  (These directives
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.)

<h3>FRC's Day in Court</h3>

<p>

On April 5, FRC received good news from a federal appeals
court in a pace-setting military homosexual case, <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both
the law passed by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations
on homosexuality in the armed forces.

<p>

The full court of 13 judges heard oral argument in December,
including argument presented by FRC's Military Readiness Project.
The MRP had filed two briefs in this case, both of which thoroughly
exposed the administration's failure to implement the law.

<p>

The law Congress passed is very clear:  no homosexuals in
the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the administration from creating
regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only could
serve, but could serve openly in the military.

<p>

In <I>Thomasson,</I> the majority federal judges said, &quot;no
way.&quot; They cited FRC by name as they ruled that the Clinton
regulations on homosexuals are invalid.  The judges declared that
the administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly how the White House was implementing the new
statute.

<p>

Meanwhile,  the MRP was in court April 8 to hear <I>Richenberg
v. Perry</I>, a federal appeals case involving a homosexual Air
Force officer.   Predictably, the government mischaracterized
the law, but for the first time a government lawyer spoke of the
increased risk of AIDS posed by homosexuals serving.

<p>

Government counsel quoted a gay activist, &quot;I didn't
fight all my life to remain celibate&quot; and used an illustration.
If an airman identifies himself as an F16 pilot, can't the military
reasonably infer that he flies?  The counsel said the military
excludes homosexuals for a similar reason.  After all, soldiers
who identify themselves as homosexuals will engage in illicit
behavior. The court in <I>Thomasson</I> found this logic compelling.

<font size=+2><b><i>The &quot;Big Blue&quot; Summit</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>&quot;A</font>t the end of today, give me your badge, your 
desk key and everything that belongs to IBM,&quot; Charlene Mitchell
remembers her manager saying to her.  &quot;Go home and don't
come back.&quot;  Mrs. Mitchell told <I>The Washington Post</I>
how she was &quot;surplused&quot; in 1993 by the computer giant,
known for decades as &quot;Big Blue.&quot;  It was a bitter pill
for Mrs. Mitchell to swallow.  She was the third generation in
her family to work for IBM.

<p>

Charlene Mitchell was just one of 12,500 layoffs by IBM in
the Washington area since 1987.  Nationally, more than 3.2 million
Americans have gotten pink slips from large multinational corporations
over a recent six-year period.  Many layoffs are inevitable, of
course, but controversial firing practices have become &quot;business
as usual&quot; under the leadership of a new crop of corporate
high-rollers.

<p>

IBM's chief, Lou Gerstner, Jr, bluntly told the nation's
governors in 1995 that they should &quot;confront and expel&quot;
anyone they saw as a barrier to achievement of the national education
goals. He invited them to a summit last month at IBM's New York
conference center:  &quot;We'll pull it all together,&quot; he
said.  Pull it he did.  Gerstner ruled discussion of parental
choice out of order, even though he conceded that the &quot;public
education system is broken.&quot;

<p>

Gerstner clashed with Gov. George Allen (R-Va.) behind closed
doors when the conservative opposed national curricula and national
tests.  How could Gerstner force the governors to accept his edicts?
He pointedly reminded them and the press that IBM is already
the largest employer in North Carolina and Vermont.  He enlisted
other corporate bigs into making the same threat: reform our
way or face a hiring boycott of your states.

<p>

It's ironic to be battling over education standards now.
Pro-family conservatives were among the first recruits for the
education reform movement of the 1980's.  We cheered when my boss,
Bill Bennett, called for &quot;Content, Character and Choice.&quot;
We battled the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American education.
We wanted teachers who can teach and school curricula that emphasize
the basics:  reading, writing, math, history and reliable standards
of right and wrong.  Instead, we've seen the education reform
movement hijacked by people who have given such &quot;triumphs&quot;
as vague, behavioral Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and anti-American
history standards.

<p>

Nobody has greater concern for the future economic success
of America's young graduates than their own parents.  But it's
a mistake to look at education as just a matter of work force
preparation. Education is primarily about family, faith
and freedom.  It must pass on the heritage of Western Civilization.
When we concentrate on basics, when we respect parents' rights
and the authority of locally elected school boards, excellence
will follow.

<p>

One corporate executive at the IBM summit admitted as much.
He described his state of New Hampshire. They still have New
England town meetings to discuss school issues, he said, and parents
are actively engaged in their children's education.  The result:
top scores for New Hampshire kids on national tests, even though
the state spends very little per pupil.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>&quot;I LIKE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE<br>
MODEL.&quot;</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

I like the New Hampshire model, not the German model that
is increasingly put forward by Marc Tucker, a liberal education
theorist and close associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  In
the same issue of <I>Newsweek</I> (April 8) where Jonathan Alter
touted the German model for education and job training, the magazine's
&quot;Business&quot; section reported a German unemployment rate
twice ours. Mercedes-Benz is building factories outside Germany
for the first time in its history.  There is serious division
in German society -- East-West splits, anti-immigrant violence,
and skinhead, directionless youth.

<p>

We can have excellent schools if we respect parental rights,
institute parental choice and uphold our free institutions.  We
should not try to make our kids over in anyone else's image: 
Let Americans be Americans!

<p>

&quot;<font size=+3>T</font>he Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful 
antidote to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the 
hands of some injudicious judges.&quot; -- Gary Bauer, FRC president, 
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 1996.

<p>

On July 12, the House of Representatives approved the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) by an overwhelming vote of 342 to 67.
The bill defines marriage for federal purposes as &quot;the union
of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot;  It also asserts
the power of Congress to interpret the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the Constitution to protect the other 49 states if Hawaii legalizes
homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; as expected later this year.

<p>

<center><h3>Senate Action Soon</h3></center>

<p>

As of press time, DOMA was slated for Senate action before the
August 3 recess.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has threatened
to attach an amendment to the bill that would grant homosexuals
special workplace protection.  This could kill DOMA, since the
Kennedy amendment is an unacceptable, back-door way of enacting
federal gay rights legislation.  Calls are needed to Capitol Hill
to urge legislators to &quot;pass DOMA pure.&quot;

<p>

The swift consideration of DOMA is testament to the hard work
of thousands of pro-family activists who have pressed Congress
to act.  FRC's government relations staff report that Capitol
Hill has been inundated with calls and letters supporting DOMA.

<p>

On June 24, leaders of 11 state family policy councils allied
with FRC and Focus on the Family spoke in support of DOMA at a
Washington press conference that drew national and regional press
coverage.

"URGE LEGISLATORS TO<br>
PASS DOMA PURE"
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

On July 3, FRC hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on DOMA with eight
experts who analyzed the faulty research on homosexuality and
addressed the importance of traditional marriage in law, culture,
education and adoption.  Speakers included author Dr. Jeffrey
Satinover,  Transformation Ex-Gay Ministry leader Anthony Falzarano,
Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley Arkes, FRC cultural
studies director Robert Knight, social work specialist Brenda
Destro, adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former school principal
and author Linda Page, journalist Peter LaBarbera, and Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Briefing Highlights</h3></center>

<p>

The two-hour briefing ran live on C-SPAN, which repeated it three
times during the next two days.  Millions of Americans learned
facts about homosexuality and the homosexual political agenda
that are routinely omitted from media coverage.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>

<b>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.</b>, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale:  &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea
is true, and in fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence
to the contrary.&quot;

<p>

<b>Hadley Arkes</b>: &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'  We can count on the fact
that there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue
by raising a challenge in the court....&quot;

<p>

Anthony Falzarano: &quot;I speak to you today not just as an
observer of this movement, but as one of them.  I am a former
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 until
I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle thinking that there really
wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't realize is that although
I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay.  I
had a choice.... Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle
that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all
kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us....&quot;

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Bill Emerson, RIP.</b>  A strong champion of the sanctity of
life and the family, Rep. Bill Emerson (Mo.) died of cancer June
22.  Emerson was universally admired by his colleagues and popular
with his constituents.  His public career was sparked by service
as a Congressional page at age 16.  The flag-waving families who
lined his funeral route and the members of Congress who paid him
tearful tribute during a July 12 memorial service offered praise
to his memory.  Emerson's quiet service was marked with integrity
and devotion.

<p>

<b>Istook Tries.</b> On July 11, the House passed the 1997 funding
bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education. Defeated: a pro-family amendment offered by Rep.
Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) that would have required written parental
consent before a teenager receives any services, including abortion
referrals, under the Title X federal family planning program.
The House also defeated an attempt by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.)
that would have allowed federally-funded human embryo experiments.
Current law prohibits such research on live human embryos.

<p>

<b>Unaccountable.</b> The House and Senate passed separate health
reform bills last spring with bipartisan support, yet no compromise
has been reached.  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been holding
the bill hostage by refusing to let the Senate leadership appoint
conferees.  Kennedy opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
were contained in the House bill but narrowly defeated by the
Senate.  He has vowed to continue stalling until the leadership
appoints a majority of conferees opposed to MSAs. If Kennedy
succeeds, much-needed reforms (in access and ability to keep insurance
when changing jobs) will go by the boards.

<p>

<b>Jubilee Pits.</b> &quot;Come, Holy Spirit&quot; -- with those
words, Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) took the floor of Congress on
June 27 and defended his Christian faith, biblical sexual morality,
and FRC's role in exposing the homosexual &quot;circuit&quot;
party in a federal building in April. Dornan made the remarks
in response to a personal attack by fellow Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R-Wis.).  For a full transcript of Rep. Dornan's remarks as they
were printed in the <I>Congressional Record</I>, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fdabortion">

<b>FDA Variety Store.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Reproductive Drug Advisory Committee
initiated hearings on two new abortion drugs -- hearings not solicited
by a drug manufacturer.  On June 28, the FDA committee decided
that increased dosages of oral contraceptives were &quot;safe&quot;
and &quot;effective&quot; for use as an abortifacient &quot;morning-after
pill.&quot;  Pro-abortion groups urged the FDA to force reluctant
manufacturers to relabel oral contraceptives for post-coital use.
On July 19, the same FDA committee considered approving RU-486
for use in the US.  FRC attended both hearings and  publicly opposed
both FDA actions.

<p>

<b>China MFN.</b> The Clinton administration prevailed in renewing
China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade status for
the coming year.  On June 27, an effort to revoke China's MFN
status failed in the House of Representatives by vote of 141 to
286.  However, the House did pass a second, non-binding resolution
(H. Res. 461 by vote of 411 to 7) which called for hearings and
possible legislation to punish China for its military intimidation
of Taiwan, weapons sales, and human rights abuses.  FRC supports
hearings and opposes MFN for China because of its myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Five-ring Political Circus.</b> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
were, sadly, misused to advance the homosexual agenda.  The Olympic
torch run bypassed Cobb County, Georgia, and Greenville County,
South Carolina, because officials there passed resolutions opposing
homosexuality.  The torch was actually hidden in a van and driven
through Greenville County during the night.  Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration lifted the ban on HIV-infected immigrants for the
Olympics, just as was done earlier for the Gay Games in New York.
It's not known whether other infectious diseases got equal opportunity.

<p>

<b>First Advocate.</b> In a first-ever presidential interview
with a homosexual magazine, President Clinton told <I>The Advocate</I>
(June 25) that his administration &quot;has taken more steps than
any previous in bringing the gay and lesbian communities to the
table.&quot;  Los Angeles-based Liberation Publications, which
publishes <I>The Advocate</I>, also owns Alyson Publications,
a Boston-based publisher of <I>Heather Has Two Mommies, Daddy's
Roommate, Daddy's Wedding</I> and books about sado-masochistic
sex with children.  One book gives advice for homosexual pedophiles
on how to avoid prosecution.

<p><a name="marijuana">

<b>MUM's Not the Word.</b> California's &quot;Medical Use of
Marijuana&quot; initiative will appear on the November ballot.
International &quot;decriminalization&quot; promoters who have
bankrolled this initiative claim it will provide &quot;compassionate
use&quot; of marijuana without prescription for people with cancer,
AIDS and glaucoma, but the initiative allows use for &quot;any
other illness&quot; and would virtually legalize possession and
cultivation for anyone, including children.  The federal government
rejects smoking marijuana as a medicine because it has serious
physical and psychological consequences.  Physicians wishing to
prescribe THC, marijuana's active ingredient, have the FDA-approved
drug Marinol.

<h3>FRC: Ready and <i>Abel</i></h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court will decide this September whether to hear the
first challenge to the Pentagon's new ban on homosexuals in the
military.  This appeal was prompted by the high court's recent
ruling that Colorado cannot constitutionally bar &quot;special
rights&quot; laws for homosexuals.

<p>

On July 1, 1996, former Navy Lieutenant Paul Thomasson, who was
discharged for proclaiming, &quot;I am gay,&quot; asked the high
court to hear his case.  He challenged both the law passed by
Congress and the Clinton administration's regulations on homosexuality
in the armed forces.

<p>

Thomasson lost his challenge in both the federal district and
appeals courts.  The appeals court hearing was noteworthy because
it included oral argument presented on behalf of the Family Research
Council.  FRC had filed two briefs in this case, both of which
thoroughly exposed the administration's illegal plans to use the
military to legitimize homosexuality.

<p>

Thomasson's attorney said his appeal decision was influenced by
the high court's <I>Romer v. Evans</I> ruling, which struck
down Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; amendment.  He claims
that the judicial landscape has improved greatly with <I>Romer</I>.
Writing for the Supreme Court's minority in the <I>Romer</I>
decision, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is &quot;no foundation
in American constitutional law&quot; for the court's ruling.

<p>

It's expected the Clinton Justice Department will favor the appeal
request.  If the court accepts <I>Thomasson</I>, oral arguments
will likely be held this fall with a decision next spring.  The
military's ban should be upheld -- if the Supreme Court relies
on the constitution.

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) has participated in 12
homosexual court cases so far.  Should the <I>Thomasson</I> case
be heard, the MRP will file an amicus brief and ask the high court
for time to make oral argument.

<p>

Meanwhile, also on July 1, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit returned the <I>Abel et al. v. Perry</I> case
to federal district court directing that judge to determine whether
the military can constitutionally exclude soldiers who engage
in homosexual conduct.  The lower court previously ruled that
the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the six service members
in <I>Abel</I> were violated when the military sought to discharge
them based solely on their <I>admission</I> of homosexuality,
without regard to actual conduct.

<h3>Ban the Postcards!</h3>

<p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate and was vetoed by President Clinton on April 10,
1996.  The House will first attempt to override the President's
veto shortly after Labor Day. A two-thirds majority of those
present and voting is required to override.  If the House vote
is successful, the Senate is expected to make an override attempt
shortly thereafter. These are crucial pro-life votes.

<p>

On June 29-30, the nation's Catholic bishops sponsored a massive
pro-life postcard campaign (in local churches) to members of Congress
to urge support for the override.  It is expected that millions
of postcards will flood Capitol Hill in the next month or two.
The House Post Office has reportedly hired extra workers to deal
with the heavy influx of cards.

<p>

The Clinton White House is not waiting for the cards to react,
however. Administration officials at the Pentagon attempted to 
silence Catholic chaplains on military bases by issuing a directive 
forbidding them to mention the postcard campaign in church. They 
claimed it involved &quot;partisan political activity,&quot; a 
claim belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was 
passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
Congress.  Many Catholic service members and their families believe 
that they were illegally denied the guidance of their priests and 
bishops on this vital issue. A legal defense fund which specializes 
in religious liberty cases is reportedly planning to file suit on 
behalf of military chaplains who believe that their First Amendment 
rights were violated.

<p>

FRC urges concerned citizens to call on their legislators to override
the veto by talking with them personally, especially at local
&quot;town meetings&quot; during the August congressional recess.
Calls and/or letters to the members' district offices are also
encouraged.  Please continue to educate your friends and neighbors
about partial-birth abortions by writing &quot;letters to the
editor&quot; to local newspapers, participating in radio talk
shows, etc.

<font size=+2><b><i>The Court's Conscientious Dissenter</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>J</font>ustice Antonin Scalia is making a name for himself 
as a conscientious objector to a Supreme Court run amok.  He is heard 
most often from the dissenting side these days, frequently accompanied 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
His dissents are noteworthy -- some would say notorious.  Justice
Scalia has an uncanny knack for cutting through the majority's
sophistry and sloppy self-justification to make a stunning legal
defense of American tradition, true democracy, plain old common
sense and decency.

<p>

Scalia shines the light of truth on &quot;this most illiberal
Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after
another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's
law trained elite) into our Basic Law.&quot;  He believes that
it is &quot;no business of the courts (as opposed to the political
branches) to take sides in the cultural war.&quot;  We at FRC
believe the same, and Scalia's measured umbrage is our vicarious
voice.

<p>

In response to special rights gained by the well-funded gay lobby
in several Colorado cities, voters across the state approved a
constitutional amendment that would prevent any person from getting
such legal privileges solely on the basis of their homosexuality.
The Court majority said that the amendment was unconstitutional
because it was obviously born of hatred against gays, despite
what the Coloradans say.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
THE COURT UNASHAMEDLY<br>
OVERSTEPS ITS AUTHORITY.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Scalia retorted that &quot;[t]he Court's portrayal of Coloradans
as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled 'gay-bashing'
is so false as to be comical.&quot;  He also deplored the sinister
effect of the Court's &quot;verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence
to traditional attitudes.&quot;  Scalia charged the majority with
&quot;tak[ing] sides in the culture wars,&quot; specifically,
choosing &quot;the views and values of the lawyer class from which
the Court's Members are drawn&quot; and supporting this choice
&quot;by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine.&quot;

<p>

The Court unashamedly overstepped its authority, he wrote: &quot;Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia took up his pen again in the case challenging the male-only
admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute:  &quot;Since
it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States
-- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I
dissent....Today the Court shuts down an institution that has
served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and
distinction for over a century and a half.&quot;  To do that,
it &quot;sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people.&quot;

<p>

In one of the last cases of the term, Justice Scalia rhetorically
shook his head: &quot;The court must be living in another world.
Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution
for a country I do not recognize.&quot;

<p>

Those are stark words from the bench, words befitting the steady
dismantling of legislative prerogatives today's &quot;conservative&quot;
Supreme Court is engaged in.  But Scalia is no doomsayer.  A recent
report of a celebration of his first 10 years on the bench with
his present and former law clerks noted that, despite his angry
dissents, Justice Scalia is a happy man with a sense of hope.
Apparently he knows, as we know, that ours is not in the winning,
but in the trying.

<center><h1>THE LEAST OF THESE</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>oes increased social spending equate with better 
childhoods? For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats 
have been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Social spending by the
federal government for children and families has increased dramatically
since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.  Yet, almost
all indicators suggest that child well-being today lags behind
what it was three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates expect government to substitute
for mothers and fathers.  But noted child psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
has written that what a child needs more than government programs
is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot; of fiercely
loving parents.

<p>

It's time to acknowledge that government can't buy love for
children any more than money can buy happiness for adults.  What
children really need are a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>Parents, Not Programs</h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children.
The new law would simply protect parents' rights to decide what
is best for their children without excessive interference from
Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents.  One good
example is &quot;Megan's Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed
and the President has signed.  The new law requires states to
notify local law officials when convicted sex offenders are released
from prison and requires the police to notify the public when
a dangerous sex offender moves into the neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3>Yes to Adoption</h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents of their own.  But the importance of parents
remains the same -- or is even greater -- for children who are
alone.  The best government can do is to speed these children
into loving homes where loving parents are waiting.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet by the Senate, offers
hope for vulnerable children currently free to be adopted.  In
the United States alone, there are over 50,000 foster children
awaiting adoption.  Over 20,000 children have been waiting for
a family for years.  The new legislation includes a $5,000 
non-refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses (for both 
domestic and international adoptions).  In order to eliminate unnecessary 
waiting periods for minority children in foster care, the legislation
also prohibits the use of racial considerations if they cause
a delay or denial of an adoption placement.

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children; but Conna
Craig, President of the Institute for Children, argues that only
an overhaul of the foster care system will save children like
John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was three, John's childhood is fast slipping
away.  He needs policymakers to understand that every child needs
a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>It Takes a Pro-Family Village</h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities
to help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When
so many children are languishing without families of their own,
community becomes all the more important.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
STAND FOR CHILDREN?<br>
STAND FOR FAMILIES.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Republican Congressmen James Talent (Mo.) and J. C. Watts (Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout
ever could by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public
housing reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle
economic development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding
communities, we will strengthen the hands of parents -- and restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's fair to admit that it takes a village.  Just as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal fiefdom that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.  Standing for children means
standing for families first.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Senate Shake-Up.</b> Robert Dole leaves the Senate on June
11, freeing him of the need to navigate the Senate's procedural
obstacles.  Dole's departure has also set off a chain reaction
of races for top leadership posts in the Senate.  Majority Whip
Trent Lott and Republican Conference Chairman Thad Cochran are
vying to succeed Dole, with most insiders predicting a Lott victory.
GOP Policy Committee Chairman Don Nickles is running unopposed
to succeed Lott in the number two position of Whip.  Both have
advocated limited government, traditional family values, and the
sanctity of life.

<p>

<b>Suicide with Dignity?</b> The House Judiciary Subcommittee
on the Constitution recently held a hearing on assisted suicide.
The hearing followed two new federal circuit court decisions
legalizing &quot;physician-assisted suicide.&quot;  Witnesses
discussed the legal and moral ramifications of the rulings.  The
Ninth Circuit based many of its arguments on the <I>Roe</I> (1973
abortion decision) interpretation of &quot;privacy,&quot; overturning
a law approved by Washington State voters to ban assisted suicide.
The Second Circuit overturned a similar New York law. Several
members of Congress are writing legislation to reverse or restrict
these flawed decisions.

<p>

<b>Aiding Babies.</b> Congress has passed a measure under the
Ryan White Care Act to reduce the transmission of AIDS from pregnant
women to their babies.  The provision promotes voluntary counseling,
testing and treatment for pregnant women and the testing of newborns
for HIV.  Testing of newborns for HIV will be required if states
have not reduced the number of infected infants by 2000.  This
issue had been in deadlock for months because of opposition by
certain homosexual and feminist groups.  They argued that it could
lead to expanded mandatory AIDS testing and infringe on a woman's
&quot;right to privacy.&quot;

<p>

<b>PX Porn.</b> The House of Representatives' 1997 Defense Authorization
Act bans future military sales of pornography.  Last year the
Pentagon sold 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines, earning $4.3 million.  Military customers pay less
than the market price and pay no tax.  Government vending of pornography
sends the message that profiting from material that demeans women
is okay.  But common sense and science show that readily available
porn encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook.
Senate action is next.

<p>

<b>Gambling Loses.</b> Pro-family forces, overcoming a well-financed
gambling industry campaign, secured Senate committee passage
of legislation to create a Gambling Impact and Policy Commission
(S. 704) on May 14.  The House passed similar legislation (H.R.
497) on March 5.  The unanimous Senate vote eases the way for
final congressional approval.  The Gambling Commission, which
has been granted subpoena power, will evaluate the industry's
impact on families, businesses and society.  The Commission will
submit recommendations for Congress and the states and will provide
insight into the consequences of legalized gambling.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Bioethical Lapse.</b> President Clinton will soon appoint
15 members to his National Bioethics Advisory Commission.  The
commission's role is to &quot;identify broad principles to govern
the ethical conduct of research.&quot;  A White House office released
a revealing list of potential nominees.  Among the extreme views:
a Harvard Medical School professor who advocates legal changes
in the definition of death so that organs can be harvested for
transplantation before brain death occurs, and a Yale lawyer who
argues that parents who withhold birth control from their adolescent
children commit child neglect.

<p>

<b>Racial Reconciliation.</b> Family Research Council recently
hosted a meeting of African-American leaders in Washington, D.C.,
to discuss projects for racial reconciliation.  Among the goals
of the meeting was to reaffirm FRC's desire to address the specific
needs and concerns of all families, regardless of race or culture.
Participants explored how FRC and other family organizations
can more effectively fulfill the pro-family mission and help to
heal ethnic divisions in modern America.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Sleet, Snow, and Frosty U.S. Attorneys.</b> On May 9, the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service successfully busted a nationwide
child pornography ring, despite the refusal by U.S. Attorney Janet
Napolitano and others to cooperate.  Napolitano, a Clinton appointee,
reportedly refused to authorize a search warrant for the operation
because she felt it improperly targeted homosexual men.  However,
inspectors were able to obtain the search warrant from local authorities.
Senators Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have asked
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Napolitano to determine
whether she wrongly impeded the sting.

<p>

<b>Pro-life Planks.</b> Twelve Catholic and Protestant pro-life
leaders (including Gary Bauer) have signed a public pledge supporting
the current Republican platform language on legal protection for
unborn children.  While most media stories have focused on 
&quot;inside-the-beltway&quot; Republican skirmishes over this language, 
many pro-life Democrats are disturbed about their party's entrenched position 
favoring abortion on demand. Some 40 pro-life House Democrats are urging
party leaders to rewrite the 1996 platform to support at least
some protection of prenatal life.

<h3>FRC: Friend of the Family</h3>

<p>

The battle for pro-family policy is increasingly being fought,
not only in the halls of Congress, but in the courts.  In many
cases, groups opposing pro-family policies take advantage of liberal
courts, avoiding public and congressional debate of controversial
issues.  FRC has filed amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;)
briefs in many cases, several of which are highlighted and described
below.

<p>

FRC has been active in defending anti-pornography laws in
cases like <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>.  In this case, FRC acted
as co-counsel defending the Communications Decency Act.  Our brief
defends the constitutionality of the Act, which is designed to
prohibit the knowing distribution of pornography to children.
No matter the outcome, all parties anticipate that the case will
ultimately go to the Supreme Court.

<p>

FRC has also been vocal in pro-life cases around the country.
Most recently, FRC filed an amicus brief in <I>Shenck v. Pro-Choice
Network</I>, a case to be heard in the Supreme Court in October
debating the constitutionality of court-ordered, 15-foot &quot;floating
bubble zones&quot; around patients entering and exiting abortion
clinics.  These &quot;zones&quot; are specifically intended to
prevent peaceful demonstrators from talking to anyone going in
or out of an abortion clinic.

<p>

In <I>United States of America v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>,
FRC has co-sponsored a brief defending the right of the Virginia
Military Institute to admit males only and to continue receiving
government funds.  This case holds implications for all publicly
supported single-sex schools, whether military or not, across
the country.

<p>

<I>Romer v. Evans</I> (the &quot;Amendment 2&quot; case)
was decided on May 20.  FRC filed an amicus curiae brief asserting
that the Supreme Court of Colorado wrongly negated the people's
right to pass laws that deny special rights to homosexuals.  The
6-3 Supreme Court decision means that pro-family voters are effectively
precluded from winning on this issue at the state level, at least
insofar as a measure binds lower political jurisdictions.

<p>

Melinda Paras, spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, commented that the decision drives a &quot;stake through
the heart&quot; of ballot measures sponsored by pro-family groups.
FRC is examining options for a legislative response to <I>Romer,</I>
and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution has
promised to hold hearings.

<h3>Free Needles for Junkies?</h3>

<p>

A major media push is under way, using government reports,
to prove that giving clean needles to drug addicts slows the 
spread of the AIDS virus without encouraging illegal drug use. 
But the evidence is inconclusive and should not be used to 
start dangerous needle give-away programs.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the leading and much-cited
government needle study say that needle exchange programs (NEPs)
&quot;are not the panacea their supporters hope for.&quot; They
favor more drug treatment rather than exchanges.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to
support exchanges if they can be scientifically shown to slow
the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  So far, however,
needle studies are problem-plagued.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
and a former needle researcher, has expressed concern that NEPs
&quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  There are
75 NEPs now operating in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.
These programs provide free drug-injecting supplies, condoms,
advice on shooting drugs properly, warnings about bad heroin,
and counseling that sometimes leads to treatment.

<p>

Lee Brown, President Clinton's first drug czar, said he &quot;can
find no compelling reason&quot; to fund NEPs.  Barry McCaffrey,
the nation's new czar, has said, &quot;The problem is not dirty
needles; the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer
way to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists
and pro-drug legalization forces to pressure the federal government
to approve funds for NEPs.

<font size=+2><b><i>Renewing Our Vows</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n announcing his support for the just-introduced 
federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana had
this to say:

<p>

&quot;The definition of marriage is not created by politicians
and judges, and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in
our history, our laws, our deepest  moral and religious convictions,
and our nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and
one woman.  This fact can be respected or it can be resented.
But it can't be altered.&quot;

<p>

If someone had told me five years ago that we would find
ourselves in 1996 defending marriage as the union of one man and
one woman, I would have asked him if he wanted me to take him
to my leader -- jokingly, of course.

<p>

Yet this idea of opening marriage to homosexual couples,
which seems more suited to another planet, is stalking the land.
Prompted by an impending court decision in Hawaii, legislators
in more than 30 states are rushing to protect their marriage statutes.
As of this writing, 11 states had enacted marriage protection
laws. 

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
ELEVEN STATES HAVE ACTED TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

At the federal level, the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced
in the House on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob
Barr (R-Ga.) and in the Senate on May 8 by Don Nickles (R-Okla.).
It is being endorsed by a slowly growing list of Congressional
sponsors, but many more are needed -- and swiftly, as the Supreme
Court decision in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> illustrates (<I>See</I> 
&quot;Courtwatch,&quot; page 3).

<p>

This is the most important pro-family legislation in many
years.  If marriage falls, it will begin a domino effect that
will totally redefine families within the law and culture.  For
starters, children will be taught in school that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, businesses will be forced
to subsidize homosexual relationships, and churches that uphold
biblical morality will find themselves outside the civil law.

<p>

On Mother's Day, I debated Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) on
<I>This Week With David Brinkley.</I>  I reminded Mr. Frank that
it was fitting that we were discussing this on Mother's Day, since
our celebration of motherhood is one of the most powerful expressions
of just why the idea of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; is so
dopey.  But it is more than dopey; it is dangerous.

<p>

If unelected judges in Hawaii are able to impose their will
on the rest of the nation through the Constitution's Full Faith
and Credit Clause (which compels the states to recognize each
other's licenses and records), then what's safe?  If two men can
marry, why can't three men?  Or two men and a woman?  Or a man
and a boy?

<p>

During our debate, Frank made the usual unfounded charge
that his opponents are motivated by &quot;hatred&quot; and 
&quot;prejudice.&quot; He repeated what has become homosexual activists' 
key argument against DOMA:  it is unnecessary.  Homosexual 
&quot;marriage&quot; is still illegal all over the U.S.  In other words, 
Barney Frank and friends want us to wait for a judicial defeat before we 
take the field in defense of marriage.  I'm sorry, but that's not good
enough. Marriage is the God-given foundation of society, and if
we let it be ruined, our children will rightly hold us responsible.

<p>

During the Battle of Britain, when things looked darkest,
Winston Churchill told the English people to &quot;never give
up.  Never, never, never, never give up.&quot;  Well, friends,
not only won't we give up defending marriage, we cannot give up.
I urge you to call or write your senators and congressman now
and press them to sponsor DOMA. Next Mother's Day, I don't
want to be debating a triumphant Barney Frank and his newly married
&quot;spouse.&quot;

<p><hr width=50%><p>

On May 19, the Family Research Council placed a full-page ad in 
<i>The Washington Post</i> with the tag line, "Let's Save Marriage, 
Before the Whole Cake Crumbles." The ad summarized the arguments for 
preserving the institution of marriage as a legally binding 
relationship between one man and one woman. <b>For a copy of the ad,

<center><h1>TYRANNY IN ROBES</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling 
whose destructive power may rival the infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> 
(1973) decision.

<p>

In <I>Romer v.  Evans</I>, the court voted 6-3 to strike
down a voter-approved amendment to Colorado's constitution that
would have prevented homosexuality from being added to civil rights
laws by the state and local governments.  The people of Colorado
had voted for Amendment 2 in response to adoption of homosexual
rights laws in several cities, including Denver and Aspen.  The
amendment took no rights away from homosexuals, merely ensuring
that homosexuality would not receive preferential treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>800,000 Bigots?</h3></center>

<p>

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, concluded
that the voters were motivated only by &quot;animus&quot; toward
homosexuals, seeking to deny them access to the political process.
In effect, he called more than 800,000 Coloradans &quot;hate-filled
bigots&quot; for withholding a powerful legal weapon from homosexual
activists.

<p>

In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the ruling
has &quot;no foundation in American constitutional law and barely
pretends to. ... Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration
of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans ... striking
it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political
will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia noted that under the court's reasoning, polygamists
could demand redress because they are disadvantaged by state laws
prohibiting polygamy.  He asked whether the court had somehow
concluded that polygamy was a greater social harm than homosexuality.
Scalia also noted that the majority had completely ignored the
1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> case, which established that states
can criminalize sodomy.  If states can do that, he wrote, then
surely they can deny &quot;preferential treatment&quot; to a class
that defines itself solely by its willingness to engage in that
behavior.

<p>

Homosexual activists celebrated the <I>Romer</I> ruling.
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich and Colorado for Family Values
President Will Perkins called for impeachment of the six majority
justices, who include Reagan appointee Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
(Reagan), David Souter (Bush), John Paul Stevens (Ford),  Stephen
Breyer (Clinton) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Clinton).  Other leaders
raised the question of judicial term limits and of activating
Congress' constitutional power to limit which cases the Supreme
Court can rule upon.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"NOT JUDICIAL JUDGMENT,<br>
BUT POLITICAL WILL."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The court did stop short of elevating &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to the same level of protection as race, ethnicity and other traditional
civil rights categories.  But the legal effect may be less than
the cultural effect.  Within hours of the decision, a lesbian
attorney in Florida said the court had ruled that homosexuality
could not be taken into account in child custody cases.  The court
did no such thing, but such broad interpretations can now be expected
to be routinely advanced in homosexuality-related cases.

<p>

<center><h3>Pass DOMA Now</h3></center>

<p>

Citizens who believe in traditional morality and the rule
of law must now rally around the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
a federal bill that defines marriage as &quot;the union of one
man and one woman as husband and wife&quot; and allows states
to ignore out-of-state marriage licenses issued to homosexual
couples.

<p>

Liberal judges in Hawaii are expected to legalize homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; as early as September, and homosexuals are
preparing to fly to Hawaii, get &quot;married,&quot; and claim
marital status in their home states.  Given the Supreme Court's
usurpation of power in Colorado, passage of DOMA (H.R. 3396) and
(S. 1740) is imperative.  DOMA will reassert the constitutional
authority of Congress, send the courts the message that America
will not surrender to homosexual activists, and secure marriage
against radical redefinition.  So far, 11 states have passed bills
protecting marriage, but DOMA is needed immediately to protect
the federal code and state marriage laws.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and congressman and urge them
to sponsor DOMA, not merely pledge to vote for it.  The Capitol
Hill switchboard is 202-225-3121.  Addresses:  U.S. Senate, Washington,
D.C.  20510; U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
20515.  Also, ask your state representatives to pass a marriage
protection law at the state level.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Medicare Package.</b> The Medicare trustees issued a report
on June 5 indicating that Medicare Part A (payment for hospital
costs) may become insolvent by 2001.  The Part A trust fund lost
$2.6 billion in 1995.  The trustees recommended that an independent
commission develop a long-term strategy. Congress passed a budget
last year which limited projected increases in Medicare spending
to an annual average of 6.4 percent.  President Clinton vetoed
that plan and insists that Congress enact his more limited proposal.
An election year resolution of this issue is unlikely.

<p>

<b>No Relief in Sight.</b> Family tax relief continues to receive
consideration on Capitol Hill, even as the presidential candidates
float various tax cut plans.  Congressional leaders may include
the child credit in a package with welfare and Medicaid reform,
or include it as part of a separate tax package.  President Clinton
threatens to veto any bill that contains the Republicans' proposed
Medicaid reforms, but it does not appear that he will sign the
tax cuts without comparable cuts in spending.  Sounds like another
&quot;Catch-22&quot; situation.

<p><a name="privacy">

<b>Preventing Predators.</b> The Children's Privacy Protection
and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996 was introduced by Congressman
Bob Franks (R-N.J.) on May 22. The purpose of this bill is to
empower parents to further protect their children from child predators.
The bill would allow parents to learn what information commercial
vendors have obtained about their children, where the information
originated, and where it has been distributed.  People who prey
on children should not be able to purchase, receive, sell, or
in any way handle personal information about children.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>No Federal Cradle.</b> Many news stories on the Stand for
Children rally sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund asked
the same questions FRC raised at a press conference the day before
the event:  Is more spending on failed federal programs really
helping children?  Or are liberal advocacy groups just using children
as props to make one last stand for big government?  FRC argued
that strong parents are still the best advocates for children.
Society's role is to help rebuild healthy communities that strengthen
the hands of those who rock the cradles.

<p>

<b>Dues Under Duress.</b> A new House Republican task force on
labor policy has recommended legislation that would protect union
members from being forced to pay dues to fund partisan politics.
In the 1994 election, 40 percent of union members voted for conservative
candidates while union chiefs generally backed liberals.  Giving
workers an option to restrict their dues to collective bargaining
purposes is an obvious way to protect the integrity of representative
government while protecting workers' interests -- and putting
hard-earned dollars back in the pockets of American workers.

<p>

<b>Justice Denied.</b> Some black youngsters in a Washington,
D.C. suburb were almost denied the chance to see how faith and
hard work can pay off in America.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas was publicly disinvited to speak at a student awards ceremony
in early June when a school official threatened to disrupt the
event.  Although the school board ultimately voted to reinvite
Thomas, the whole spectacle sent a troubling message to students,
who, fortunately, ultimately got to hear Thomas's powerful message
of personal virtue and equality before the law.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Globe</h3></center>

<p><a name="beijing">

<b>Costly Habitat.</b> From June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey, Habitat
II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, built
on the anti-family agendas of previous U.N. conferences, this
time focusing on the environmental and economic challenges of
rapid urbanization.  Urging more efforts to implement that agenda,
Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher called for a moratorium
on further U.N. world conferences.  And none too soon.  A recent
General Accounting Office study found that the U.S. Government
spent a whopping $5.9 million on the U.N. Conference on Women
held last September in Beijing, China.

<p>

<b>Rewarding Tyranny.</b> On June 3, President Clinton formally
announced his intention to extend &quot;most favored nation&quot;
(MFN) trade privileges to China.  Unless Congress quickly opposes
Clinton's stand, China will continue to enjoy low tariffs on exports
to the U.S.  FRC opposes extending China's MFN status not only
because the U.S. runs a trade deficit of $34 billion every year
with China, but especially because of China's myriad human rights
abuses, such as forced abortion and sterilization policies, exploitation
of prisoners as slave laborers, and systematic persecution of
Christians.

<p>

<b>Wirth Stumbles.</b> During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing June 4, chairman Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) put two questions
to witness Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Citing Hillary Clinton's speech during the U.N. Beijing conference,
where she strongly denounced sex selection abortion and mandatory
abortion, Helms asked Wirth if the Clinton administration would
support legislation outlawing sex selection abortion in the U.S.
and admitting refugees fleeing China's coercive abortion policies.
Wirth could not answer either question directly, saying there
were &quot;other implications&quot; which needed to be considered.

<h3>Parental Rights Vote Near</h3>

<p>

The recent pro-big-government &quot;Stand for Children&quot;
rally in Washington, D.C. had little in common with the growing
grass-roots parental rights movement, except for its focus on
children.  The Family Research Council's message to rally participants
was that government programs can never provide what children vitally
need -- parents raising them with love and direction.  Which is
to say, parents are irreplaceable.

<p>

With public school officials handing condoms to pre-teens,
it is no wonder that the parental rights movement has captured
the public's attention.  Parents across the country are finding
their voice against intrusive state and federal governments.
At the state level, parents are supporting constitutional amendments
which protect the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children without unwanted government infringement.
At the federal level, parents are supporting the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act of 1996 (PRRA), which simply codifies
Supreme Court rulings that parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children which the government must respect.

<p>

That parents, not government, should have the primary responsibility
and authority in raising their children seems beyond dispute.
Yet, the ubiquitous ACLU and their education counterpart, the
National Education Association, have weighed in with heavy protests.
They are fond of presenting hypothetical &quot;horror stories&quot;
of child abuse they claim the PRRA will permit, yet the bill specifically
excludes abusive parents from its protection.

<p>

In contrast to these theoretical concerns, real-life instances
of outrageous government violations of parents rights persist.
If the PRRA were law, parents in Pennsylvania would probably
not have had to file suit against the East Stroudsburg public
school for forcing their sixth-grade daughters to undergo vaginal
examinations without their knowledge or consent and over the tearful
protestations of the girls.  This flagrant usurpation of the right
of parents to make health care decisions for their children would
not be tolerated under the PRRA.  Without it, the Pennsylvania
parents have little certainty of success.

<p>

A vote on the PRRA is expected before August.  Call 202-225-3121
and urge your congressman and senators to vote for the PRRA (H.R.
1946; S. 984).  For information on state initiatives, contact
Of the People at 703-351-5051.

<h3>Indecent Opinion</h3>

<p>

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
has ruled against provisions of the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), the first major anti-pornography legislation for cyberspace.
This is a sad defeat with ominous implications for the burgeoning,
new &quot;global community.&quot;  The Clinton Justice Department
will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

<p>

The CDA was passed as part of the Telecommunications Reform
bill in February 1996.  It seeks to protect children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet by prohibiting adults from knowingly
sending or displaying &quot;indecent material&quot; to kids.
It imposes criminal penalties for violation of the law.

<p>

The ACLU and a coalition of liberal groups and on-line service
providers filed the challenge to the CDA in Philadelphia.  A similar
challenge was filed in New York and is still pending.  The Family
Research Council and the National Law Center for Children and
Families submitted 400 pages of legal argument and exhibits on
behalf of anti-pornography groups defending the CDA.  Judge Delores
Sloviter, a Carter appointee, headed the Philadelphia three-judge
panel which heard testimony this spring from ACLU and government
witnesses.

<p>

The CDA uses the time-tested standard of &quot;indecency&quot;
to draw the line between material that is appropriate for adults
but not for children.  &quot;Indecent material&quot; is defined
as material depicting or describing sexual or excretory activities
or organs which, in context, is presented in a patently offensive
manner.  The Supreme Court has ruled that adults have a First
Amendment right to receive indecent material and share it with
other adults, but no right to foist it upon children.  The indecency
standard has protected children in the broadcast television, radio,
and telephone media.

<p>

At closing arguments in Philadelphia, it was clear that the
ACLU was not simply quarreling with this particular law, but was
advocating no restrictions whatsoever on the dissemination of
computer pornography to children.  The Philadelphia court was
openly hostile to the Justice Department and its defense of the
CDA, and its ruling absurdly implies that the advancement of Internet
technology depends upon unfettered exhibition of sexual material
to children.

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>e got a postcard from Air Force Captain Dave Panzera 
the other day.  That's not so unusual, since we receive many calls
and letters from active duty military.  But Captain Panzera's
card came to us from <I>Antarctica.</I>

<p>

That's a dramatic example of how far and wide the
message of FRC is traveling these days.  It's not at all unusual
for us to host meetings with pastors from Southern Africa, champions
of religious liberty from Russia and pro-family leaders from Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The international interest in Family
Research Council is a reflection of the global nature of the threat
to the family.

<p>

I always try to give encouragement to our friends from abroad.
They often report feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by a tide of
pornography, drugs, abortion and sexual misconduct.  I share with
our allies some of the expanding array of communications tools
we use to get our message out.  In trying to support them, I find
that <I>I</I> am uplifted. Let me share with you, a regular reader
of <I>Washington Watch,</I> the growing array of devices we have
used in the fight for faith, family and freedom.

<p>

As Americans reduce their reliance on the liberal talking
heads of TV network news, radio has filled the gap.  Sure, there
are the Howard Sterns and Don Imuses, but well-informed pro-family
callers to radio talk shows shatter the media myths about our
movement.  My nickname for conservative programs broadcast from
our nation's capital is &quot;Radio Free Washington.&quot;  I'm
proud that Focus on the Family's news and information feature,
<I>Family News in Focus</I> (FNIF), is broadcast to hundreds of
religious stations every day.  FNIF's Washington bureau, and its
veteran chief, Carl Ramsey, are good neighbors to FRC.

<p>

My daily radio commentary, which bears the same title as
this newsletter, keeps many of you informed of late-breaking
stories and my perspective on the issues.  You can call our FRC
toll-free line at 1-800-225-4008 to obtain a listing of 
participating stations in your community.

<p>

FRC's <I>Legislative Hotline</I> is easily reached by dialing
1-202-783-HOME.  It's available 24 hours a day and is put together
each week (or more frequently as events warrant) by our top-notch
government relations staff.  You can also receive the text of
the <I>Hotline</I> via FAX.  Just call our Government Relations

I confess I'm a bit &quot;low-tech.&quot; My word processor is

a keyboard, our Internet site should please you.

<p>

When David Brinkley's producers called me recently to appear
on <I>This Week,</I> I was pleased (even if I did have to lock
horns with Rep. Barney Frank).  And CBS-TV's <I>Face the Nation</I> 
gave me yet another opportunity to tout the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).  As gratifying as these major media appearances are,
it's good to know that FRC isn't dependent on others to spread
our message.  We have our own means of getting the word out.
And that word is clearly reaching the ends of the earth.

veto. FRC is working to identify House and Senate members
who can be counted on to support override.  <B>Catholic Bishops
will launch a nationwide parish postcard campaign</B> on June
29-30 to urge override.  House will vote first.

<p>

<li><B>Religious freedom fights continue.</B>  Florida Gov. Lawton
Chiles <B>vetoed bill to allow voluntary, student-led prayer at
school events</B>.  Before veto, Florida's Attorney General sent
Chiles a memo saying, &quot;Instead of a Christian nation under
God we are officially now mandated to be a country with no
formal recognition of God [emphasis added], whether God be
Christian, Moslem, Hindu, or Unitarian.&quot;  In daily radio
commentary on June 5, Gary Bauer said, &quot;A nation that no
longer sees itself as living 'under God' <B>had better get used
to waking each morning to the same bleak headlines of violence
and despair.</B>&quot;

<a name="family"><center><h1>Family Hopes</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the impression left by the recent O.J. Simpson 
trial, a large majority of black Americans support get-tough efforts to combat 
crime.
<p>
According to FRC's newly released Family Issues Survey, 82 percent
of blacks favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals to work while serving their 
sentence.&quot; Seventy-seven percent favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals 
to pay their victims and their victims' families financial compensation for the
pain, suffering, and economic hardship they caused.&quot;  Moreover,
85 percent of blacks favor &quot;requiring criminals to undergo drug tests to show 
that they are drug-free before completing their sentence.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>Choose Life</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC poll, conducted by the Voter/Consumer Research Firm, also
found that:
<p>
<li><b>Adoption is considered the best response -- and abortion the
worst response -- to an unwed pregnancy.</b>
<p>
When asked what is the best response to an unmarried pregnancy,
29 percent choose adoption, 24 percent say marrying the child's father, 11 
percent choose single motherhood, eight percent opt for abortion, and the 
rest either volunteer that &quot;it depends&quot; or say they &quot;don't 
know.&quot; Conversely, when asked which of these options would be worst, 55 
percent say abortion, 13 percent say single motherhood, 12 percent say marrying 
the child's father, and six percent choose adoption.
<p>
<li><b>Most Americans -- including rank-and-file pro-lifers -- strongly
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.</b>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock.&quot; 
Two-thirds (66 percent) say they &quot;strongly&quot; oppose such
increases.  Another 18 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare
benefit increases for illegitimacy. 
<p>
Only 13 percent say these increases are justified. Among those
who &quot;strongly&quot; favor laws against abortion, 70 percent 
&quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap, and another 16 percent 
&quot;somewhat&quot; support this measure.
<p>
<li><b>The religiously devout are more apt to give and volunteer --
and say they would do more if government welfare programs were dramatically 
cut or abolished.</b>
<p>
People who attend worship services at least once a week report
higher levels of giving (97 percent) and volunteering (79 percent) than any 
other demographic group. Frequent churchgoers are also more likely to say they 
would give and volunteer more if &quot;government welfare programs
were cut back dramatically, or abolished.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Even young people think today's popular culture encourages
teen sex, violence and drug use.</b>
<p>
When asked to assess the degree to which today's movies, television,
and music lyrics encourage teenage sex, 63 percent of young Americans say 
&quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Fifty-six percent
offer identical responses to a question about the entertainment
industry's role in encouraging violent crime, and 47 percent say the same 
about pop culture's contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Moreover, 75 percent 
of Americans aged 18 to 30 either &quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; 
agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in today's movies,
on TV, and in music lyrics do not represent my own views.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Single parents say families need help shielding kids from harmful
cultural influences.</b>
<P>
Only 36 percent of all single parents -- and 33 percent of divorcees
-- say parents can adequately shield children from violent or sexually-explicit 
material by themselves.  Better than 60 percent of single parents agree 
with the statement, &quot;These days, it is too difficult for parents to deal 
with this alone.&quot;  Moreover, 92 percent of all those surveyed say they
do not believe public libraries should make <i>Playboy</i> magazine available 
to children without parental permission.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>FOUR FIFTHS OF AMERICANS<br>
FAVOR FAMILY TAX RELIEF.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<li><b>Most Americans strongly support permanent tax relief for families
raising children.</b>
<p>
Roughly four out of five Americans (79 percent) favor tax relief
for families raising children. Sixty-one percent say they would rather have 
&quot;a permanent tax cut beginning next year&quot; than &quot;a
temporary tax cut beginning this year.&quot;  Only 26 percent
say they would prefer temporary relief immediately.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Partial Victory.</b> Accommodating the request of a majority of senators,
a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held on the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act (H.R. 1833) on Nov. 17. The bill passed the House by vote of 288-139 
on Nov. 1, drawing the votes of such infrequent supporters of abortion limits 
as Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and freshman Rep.
Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.).  Nurse Brenda Shafer told the Senate
committee that she assisted an Ohio abortionist with several partial-birth 
abortions, but was repulsed and then quit.  Senate floor action is likely 
before Dec. 7.  The Clinton White House continues to signal a veto.
<p><a name="gambling">
<b>Gambling Scourge.</b> Rep. Frank Wolf's bill (H.R. 497) to create
The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission is gaining momentum. The 
bill, which has broad bipartisan support, does not outlaw, tax, or regulate 
gambling, but recognizes its growing influence. In 1993, Americans
made more trips to casinos than they did to major league ballparks.
 Today, casinos operate in 23 states, and 37 states have lotteries.  Studies 
show that gambling increases public corruption and other criminal activities. 
It cannibalizes legitimate businesses, and government's gambling-related
costs for regulation, lost productivity and family disintegration
outstrip the economic gain.
<p>
<b>Budget Break?</b> The battle between Congress and the White House
moved to the next stage Nov. 19 with an agreement to enact a balanced budget 
within seven years, using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic estimates. 
President Clinton reversed course and agreed to negotiate legislation by Jan. 
1 to achieve the zero deficit goal. Republican concessions on
spending control are likely.   FRC will work hard to keep the
$500-per-child tax credit in the GOP bill, as well as real spending limits 
to avoid leaving our children a legacy of debt.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Playing the Odds.</b> Gambling industry political action committees
(PAC) are influencing legislation such as proposals to tax gambling revenues 
and regulate the American Indian gaming boom.  Gambling is projected to grow 
to an $80-billion-per-year industry this decade. According to the Federal 
Election Commission, PACs gave $321,942 to the major political parties in 
1993-94, and four non-PAC industry gifts totaling $690,000 went to the 
Republican National Committee in 1994. Columnist William Safire warns 
that state-sponsored gambling is a &quot;cancer ravaging society, corrupting 
public officials and becoming the fastest-growing teenage addiction.&quot;
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown Sweeps.</b> According to a new Census Bureau report,
America is experiencing a rise in the number of Murphy Brown-style moms. 
The study, released in early November, shows that the proportion of 
college-educated, never-married women who have given birth has more
than doubled in the past 10 years, while the proportion of young,
single, black women giving birth has dropped. The report also says that 
the illegitimacy rate among all never-married white women rose from 6.7 
percent to 12.9 percent.  The greatest rise in this group was, indeed, among 
women who are managers and professionals.
<p><a name="divorce">
<b>Divorce, American Style.</b> The U.S. divorce rate dropped slightly
in 1994, but <i>The Economist</i> magazine reports that divorce is still more 
common in America than anywhere else in the world. To combat this problem, 
a growing number of pro-family state leaders are working to reform
divorce laws to protect individuals who want to save their marriages
rather than promote the interests of individuals initiating divorce proceedings. 
By a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans support such reforms, 
according to FRC's newly-released Family Issues Survey.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>FRC Intervenes.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Fourth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals granted a motion Nov. 20 that will permit FRC to present 
oral arguments in a key case involving homosexuals in the military. The 
case <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i> is likely to reach the Supreme Court next 
year. FRC sought to intervene in the appeals court to argue that the
Clinton administration regulations at issue do not faithfully reflect 
Congressional intent and will result in allowing declared homosexuals 
to serve.  Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, will represent 
FRC at the Dec. 5 hearing.
<p>
<b>Young Guns.</b> A quarter of those arrested on weapons charges are
juveniles, and such offenses are the fastest growing crime among adolescents. 
Juvenile weapons cases have grown 86 percent since 1985 to more than 61,000 
arrests last year, and teen gun violence has risen steadily even
though the number of teens has declined.  Weapons offenses include
illegal use, possession, importing or exporting of guns, ammunition and the 
like.  Attorney General Janet Reno warns, &quot;If the last decade's trends 
continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the
year 2010.&quot;
<p>
<b>Money Talks.</b> A record turnout of Maine voters narrowly rejected
a proposal on November's ballot to deny special rights to homosexuals.  Four 
hundred thousand voters took part in the 53 to 47 percent outcome.  
Pro-homosexual rights forces spent an unprecedented $1.2 million, 10 times 
more than those who oppose special rights.  Despite the close vote, 
homosexual activists are pushing ahead with their plans to introduce gay rights 
bills into the Maine legislature for the 10th time.  None has passed to date.

<h3>The Bare Non-Necessities</h3>
<p>
Did local schools notice the difference when 89 percent of the
U.S. Education Department's 5,500 employees were sent home as 
&quot;non-essential&quot; federal workers during the recent budget show-down? 
Equally unnoticeable is any improvement resulting from Washington D.C.'s 
recurrent attempts at top-down education reform:  National Education Goals,
the Goals Panel, Goals 2000, the National Standards for U.S. History.  With all 
the rhetoric and frenzy over initiatives with such visionary titles, you'd 
expect to see some results as 1995 draws to a close.
<p>
But when the National Education Goals Panel met in November to provide a 
halftime report on progress toward the eight National Education Goals, set in 
1990 for the year 2000, they could point to no significant improvement. 
&quot;Progress is spotty at best,&quot; said Albert Shanker, President of 
the American Federation of Teachers union.  The panelists urged patience; 
Americans put up $3 million this year to hear the Goals Panel stall for time.
<p>
Americans are growing increasingly impatient with dismal academic
test scores year after year. Recently released results from the 1994 
National Assessment of Educational Progress remain poor: less than a 
third of the students tested were proficient readers; 57 percent of high 
school seniors scored &quot;below basic&quot; in their knowledge of U.S.
history.  Writers of the National Standards for U.S. History released last 
year thought they could improve performance by imposing an official body 
of knowledge.  However, if the 30,000 copies already distributed make their 
way into classrooms, students will continue to know more about Madonna,
whom the standards mention, than they do about Robert E. Lee, whom the standards 
ignore.
<p>
Regrettably, our millions earmarked for education reform over
the past five years have been ill-spent on bureaucracy and systems management. 
Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, suggested in 1989, &quot;I'd 
give the education reform movement another five years.  If we're not able
to get our schools back to where they were in 1963, after spending
40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare bankruptcy, give the people 
back their money, and let them start their own schools.&quot;  Time's up. We 
want our money back.

<h3>We the Parents</h3>
<p>
FRC has taken its battle for parental rights to the Supreme
Court.  FRC joined forces with the Of the People Foundation and asked the 
high court to hear the case of Massachusetts students and parents who oppose 
a school district's program of condom distribution to junior high and high
school students.  A &quot;friend of the court&quot; petition was
filed on Nov. 15.
<p>
In early 1992 the Falmouth School District adopted a policy
whereby school nurses were instructed to distribute free condoms to students 
as young as 11 years old -- even over their parents' objections.  Condom 
machines were also installed in high school student restrooms. FRC's brief 
argues that the program violates the parents' right to direct the upbringing 
of their children as well as the right to free exercise of religion.
<p>
In 1993, New York's highest court ruled that an identical public school 
condom distribution program violated the right of parents to rear their children 
as they see fit.
<p>
This dispute highlights the need for legislation to acknowledge
and solidify parents' fundamental rights.  To accomplish this, Sen. Charles 
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) have introduced the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 (H.R. 1946).  The
act establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and
provide for the education and religious teaching of their children, and also 
addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline. Importantly, 
the act allows the government to intervene when it has a compelling interest 
to do so, and has specific allowances for cases of child abuse and neglect.
<p>
Support this much-needed legislation by calling or writing
your representatives today.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Looking for Lincoln</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>G</font>en. Colin L. Powell has declined to run for President in 
1996. He has also said that he will not accept the Vice Presidency, though 
time may change this decision. Finally, he is joining the Republican party. 
These are crucial decisions.
<p>
As everyone knows by now, Powell had described himself as 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion during an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters on the eve of his national book tour.  That position, 
combined with the warm reaction to his candidacy among some conservative
leaders in Washington, raised the real possibility that, for the first time 
in two decades, the Republican platform next year would reflect a 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; position on abortion.
<p>
The media response to this prospect, as well as to Powell, was
wild excitement.  From a strict news sense, it's not hard to understand why. 
A Powell candidacy presented historic opportunities: the nomination and 
possible election of the first black American President. Second, a GOP 
abandonment of its pro-life plank would have caused an earthquake
on the American political landscape.  Earthquakes are hard news.
<p>
The Republican Platform calls for a constitutional amendment to provide legal 
protection for the unborn.  It also calls for the appointment of judges who 
respect traditional values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  Has it 
made much difference?  One conservative leader has said that a pro-choice 
president like Powell &quot;could do more to lower the number of abortions 
than a presidential candidate who claims to be pro-life, who supports a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, but who does nothing more than pay 
lip-service to the pro-life constituency.&quot;
<p>
Of course, pro-life Americans want no part of this leader's dilemma.
 They prefer a third way: someone, Republican or Democratic, who not only claims 
to be, but is, pro-life, who supports full legal protection for the unborn, 
and who will pay service to that goal in both speech and action.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>PERSISTENCE ISN'T<br>
ALWAYS APPRECIATED.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
So why are pro-life Americans so often made to feel like skunks at the wedding 
party?  Partly, I'm sure, it's because nothing is more alien to the modern 
American mind than a moral absolute, even when that absolute is the 
overwhelming duty to refrain from taking innocent human life.  Second,
there is the matter of persistence.  It isn't always appreciated.
<p>
In his <i>Lincoln: The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg retells the story
of a White House reception after Lincoln's Second Inaugural. Frederick 
Douglass, the black anti-slavery leader, tried to enter the White House 
to greet the President.  Guards barred his way.  Douglass eluded them 
and rushed through the door.  He was seized and escorted to a plank that
led outside through a window. Once again on the street, he asked a 
passerby entering the White House to tell Lincoln that &quot;Frederick 
Douglass is detained by officers at the door.&quot;
<p>
Hearing the news, Lincoln invited Douglass into the East Room, and the 
journalist finally greeted the reelected president.  Lincoln told Douglass 
that he had seen him in the crowd listening to his address. &quot;There 
is no man's opinion that I value more than yours,&quot; Lincoln told him, 
&quot;what do you think of it?&quot;  Douglass replied, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, 
it was a sacred effort.&quot;
<p>
In this world of slippery slope relativism, where rights to do
wrong are enshrined among our political commandments, the pro-life cause 
is often treated like an unwelcome guest.  As 1996 approaches, some of 
the political &quot;palace guards&quot; are already trying to show us to the 
window again.  As they do so, we could use a little of the spirit of
Frederick Douglass.  After all, this cause is a sacred effort, too.

<a name="budget"><center><h1>KEEPING BUDGET<br>
REFORM ON TRACK</h1></center>
<font size=+3>W</font>hite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor
George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today
the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully
maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his &quot;no new
taxes&quot; pledge. Today, they decry &quot;a train wreck&quot;
they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. 
<p>
First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996
Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months
paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future
wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.
<p>
House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution
that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut
federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period,
but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton
and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the
proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. 
<p>
<center><h3>Media's False Picture</h3></center>
<p>
Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and
the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget
in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional
Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found
a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that
he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal
also produces <i>$2 trillion in new federal debt</i>.
<p>
Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming
that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They
claim the tax cuts will &quot;explode the deficit,.&quot;  But
more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief is
dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately
three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families
with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families
at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes.
Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition
of the tax package will be very &quot;family friendly.&quot;
<p>
Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending
programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending
is projected to <i>increase at twice the rate of inflation</i>
even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.
 The argument that tax cuts &quot;explode the deficit&quot; is
answered by pointing out that <i>tax revenues</i> actually increased
by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending
increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a
budget surplus today. 
<p>
Not a penny can be spent unless both houses approve. This gives
the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers'
money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal
subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal
activism. Congress has an obligation to use its &quot;power of
the purse&quot; to protect the legitimate interests of the American
family.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>BUDGET "TRAIN WRECK"<br>
WON'T HAMPER ESSENTIAL<br>
SERVICES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>A Contest of Wills</h3></center>
<p>
Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may get
through October by short-term "continuing resolutions," but by early November,
the Treasury's authority to borrow money will expire.
 Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling. 
If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash will occur. But 
<i>essential services</i> like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social
Security checks will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will
be a great hue and cry from the liberals who see their funds disappearing.
<p>
A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest
groups.  What happens if a few weeks go by and the public
doesn't miss the &quot;services?&quot;  That would provide a very
powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national
debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of
several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a
 liberal &quot;train wreck&quot; to get our country back on track,
that may be a small price to pay.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<a name="porn"><b>Calculating Moves.</b> The cyberporn debate has gone behind closed
doors during Congress' recess.  FRC has participated in several
meetings to work on a package to address this menacing aspect
of exciting new communication technology.  Later this month, Congress
will make final decisions about bill language.  Lawmakers should
stand firm in their commitment to enact strong laws against this
exploitative material, and not be swept in by the liberals' false
promise of &quot;parent-empowering&quot; software.  The software
might help, but it is no more a substitute for strong pornography
laws than bullet-proof vests are a substitute for laws against
homicide.
<p>
<b>Saving Health Care.</b> The Clinton health care plan is dead but the
issue of health care reform is still alive.  Escalating health
care costs are one of the biggest threats to the current system.
Congress is likely to consider  H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps.
William Archer (R-Texas) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.), to allow
tax-free medical savings accounts in which families or individuals
set up a special account for lower-level health care expenses,
typically around $2,500.  The benefit is the account is tax free,
portable, and can carry over from year to year for future health
needs. HR 1818 has 90 cosponsors. In the Senate, Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) has taken the lead in pushing the medical savings account
concept.     
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Quarterback Kemp.</b> The 14-member commission on taxes headed by
former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, is
expected to give its report to the congresssional Republicans
 in October.  The commission examined a flat tax plan (with no
deductions), a national sales tax, and other proposals to simplify
the tax code.  Pro-family advocates will be especially interested
in how the commission handles tax treatment of families, charitable
contributions, and home ownership.
<p>
<b>New Security Order.</b> President Bill Clinton Aug. 4 signed an Executive
Order barring the federal government from denying security clearances
to homosexuals.  The 13-page order &quot;establishes a uniform
Federal personnel security program&quot; for all federal employees
to include members of the military and commercial contractors.
 It states, &quot;No inference...may be raised solely on the basis
of the sexual orientation of the employee.&quot;  Homosexuality
has long been a red flag for national security officers performing
background investigations  because it is so often linked to known
security risks, such as drug and alcohol abuse, promiscuity and
violence.
<p>
<b>Gay Asylum, Yes. Moms, No.</b> While Mrs. Clinton talked about advancing
women's rights during the Beijing conference, 13 Chinese women
were being imprisoned by the United States and awaiting deportation
back to China. Their crime?  Fleeing China's forced abortion policies.
 Even though these Chinese women will face extreme punishment
in slave labor (Lao Dai) camps or even death if they are returned
to China, Bill Clinton has refused to grant them asylum.  In a
reversal of the Reagan-Bush immigration policy, Clinton declared
that forced abortion was no longer grounds for political asylum.
He has instead extended asylum to homosexuals fleeing &quot;persecution.&quot;
<p>
<a name="polls"><b>Polls Go South.</b> Recent public opinion polling suggests 
that Americans are not altogether pleased with Congress. A <i>Wall Street 
Journal/NBC News</i> poll found that 53 percent of respondents <i>disapprove
</i>of Congress' performance and only 36 percent approve, while
a <i>New York Times/CBS News</i> poll found a 56 percent disapproval
rating and a 31 percent approval rating for Congress.  Interestingly,
however, according to a <i>Times Mirror</i> poll, the Republican
party is ahead of the Democratic party by a greater margin than
when they swept Congress last November -- 50 percent to 43 percent.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Americans are less
satisfied with the pace of change than the direction of change.

<h3>Children's Defense?</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hile President Bill Clinton's anti-smoking campaign grabbed
headlines, his administration went to court against a South Carolina
university hospital's very successful mandatory drug testing/treatment
program for pregnant cocaine-addicted women. Mothers who refuse
treatment for themselves and their unborn children would face
arrest and jail time. The program works. Most women stayed drug-free
during their pregnancy. Still, Clinton's aides charged that South
Carolina's program was punitive and violated the addicted mother's
&quot;privacy rights.&quot;  Is the health and well-being of unborn
children less important than those who already born?
<p>
<a name="aids">Then there is the issue of 7,000 deliveries per year in U.S.
to HIV-infected women. About 2,000 of these infants are infected
with HIV. Rep.Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who is a medical doctor, and
Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) plan to offer an &quot;infant testing&quot;
amendment to the Ryan White Care Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) that would
require states -- in order to qualify for federal Ryan White Care
funding -- to pass laws requiring every newborn be tested for the
HIV virus if mother does not (voluntarily) undergo prenatal
testing.  The amendment would require the test results to be told
to mothers, and it also encourages HIV counseling, testing and
treatment of pregnant women.
<p>
According to Dr. Coburn, his amendment is an important step in
combating AIDS.  &quot;In fact, studies have shown that the rate
of transmission of the virus from mothers to children can be reduced
by two-thirds if the drug AZT is administered during pregnancy,
labor and the first six weeks after birth,&quot; Coburn explains,
&quot;Knowing the status of the baby right away would allow treatment
and counseling to begin immediately and prevent an uninformed
mother from transmitting HIV to her baby through breast feeding.&quot;
<p>
Presently, 45 states require up to <i>nine</i> mandatory generic
newborn tests, such as syphilis and hepatitis, but not HIV. As
a public health issue, the incidence of AIDS in infants requires
that common sense become public sense.

<h3>Defending our Defenders</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>RC has filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> (&quot;friend of 
the court&quot;) brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Amendment 2&quot;
case.  Media reports contend that <i>Romer v. Evans</i> will decide
whether the Constitution allows Colorado to &quot;discriminate
against&quot; homosexuals. Wrong. The case is really about
whether the people of Colorado may decide not to grant special
protected legal status to this &quot;class&quot; of persons.
 The Supreme Court justices will hear oral argument in the case
 Oct. 2.    
<p>
<a name="gay">In the military, homosexual servicemen have begun filing lawsuits
to block their discharge.  FRC is working on the following cases:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Philips v. Perry</i>, FRC filed the winning brief calling
for the dismissal of a case filed by a homosexual sailor seeking
to block his discharge.  In the case, Philips admitted past sexual
misconduct and his intention to engage in future misconduct. 
The federal district court dismissed Philip's case, and FRC is
preparing another brief arguing against his appeal.  
<p><li>A federal district court June 9 upheld the military's policy
on homosexuality in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>.  The ruling was
based upon the pre-1993 exclusion policy, not on the Department
of Defense's  (DoD) new &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; regulations.
 This is significant.  The Clinton administration has argued that
its 1993 change in policy was necessary to avoid constitutional
problems, but the Thomasson ruling shows that the &quot;old
rules&quot; were constitutionally sound.  Thomasson has appealed
this ruling to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and FRC has
filed a brief supporting the constitutionality of the old policy.
</ul><p>
The <i>new</i> DoD regulations were the subject of a challenge
in the case of <i>Able v. U.S..</I> The federal district court
judge in Able ruled that six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their open admission they were
homosexuals, and ruled that the Pentagon was enjoined from discharging
them.  Attorney General Janet Reno has appealed the ruling, but,
given the Justice Department's  lackluster performance so far,
FRC does not anticipate a vigorous effort at the appeals court
level.  FRC has filed an <i>amicus</i> brief setting forth all
of the key arguments for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals
which the Clinton administration has ignored. FRC's efforts have
been undertaken by the Military Readiness Project, a joint task
force of FRC and senior retired military leaders.

<a name="gary"><center><b><font size=+2><i>Dumb and Dumber?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
School's back. The bumper stickers on buses remind us to be careful
of the youngsters. Time was when accidents going to and from school
were the main worry of parents. No more. Today, we have concerns
about violence and drugs in schools. Many parents are troubled
by efforts in school to undermine the values and beliefs the kids
are taught at home. And, of course, there's OBE. Outcome-based
Education is the latest in a long line of educational fads that
have dumbed down American classrooms. 
<p>
<center><h3>&quot;Re-structuring&quot; SATs</h3></center>
<p>
Now, it seems, even the SATs have been affected. The Scholastic
Aptitude Tests have been  an important measure of how well our
young people are doing.  I remember during my service as President
Reagan's Undersecretary of Education how we pointed to the 85-point 
skid in SAT scores (1960-80) as indisputable proof of educational
decline. We even prodded a sluggish education establishment to
cough  up the extensive data we published as &quot;the Wall Chart.&quot;
That chart demonstrated that many of the states which spent the
least per pupil nonetheless produced students with the highest
scholastic aptitude. Was I unpopular with the bureaucrats!
<p>
Despite a 93 percent spending hike in the 1980s, the education
establishment continued to crank out under-prepared graduates.
So the SATs have been subjected to steady criticism from liberals.
Finally, the College Board has responded. With great fanfare,
education leaders announced that this year's scores were -- UP!
That <I>would</I> be great news except for some inconvenient truths.
First, this is a new and improved SAT test. They call it SAT I,
but its real name should be <i>SAT-lite.</i> It has fewer
questions, but it allows students 30 minutes more to finish. The
designers of SAT-lite have thrown overboard the more challenging
antonyms section, making it easier to score high on the the verbal
portion of the exam. Oh, and it's now OK to use a calculator.
No more unfair advantages to those grinds who memorized their
times tables! 
<p>
Test-makers say  they have changed the SATs in order to keep
up &quot;with what and how students are learning today.&quot;
What and how students learn today is increasingly determined by
President Bill Clinton and Education Secretary Dick Riley under
their ill-conceived &quot;Goals 2000&quot; legislation. Of course,
the College Board disclaims any attempt to dumb down the SATs.
But they are funded by the U.S. Department of Education. We could
hardly expect them to bite the hand that feeds them. With these
new SAT-lite test results, the Clinton administration will be
able to reassure concerned parents: &quot;See, our reforms are
working!&quot;  But this is the same team that called the State
of Ohio on the carpet last year for requiring high school graduates
to pass an eighth grade-level test. The Clinton administration
said those tests might be racially discriminatory.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>Excellence the Goal</h3></center>
<p>
Make no mistake: pro-family Americans don't want kids
to fail in school. We believe that a stress on solid academic
basics, giving special needs children the extra help they may
require, is the best way to progress. We believe in competition
and a commitment to excellence. We know that parents are the key
to real education progress. And we think parents should be able
to choose the safe and challenging school that meets their childrens'
needs. We don't believe it helps anyone artificially to try to
build up a child's self-esteem by lowering the standards. Minority
children, as well as special needs kids and rural kids, can achieve.
The pursuit of excellence helps everyone.

</center>

Robert H. Knight examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and 
are affected by cultural values.  Of special interest are federal 
policies relating to arts funding, sex-related topics and education, 
censorship and freedom of expression, as well as the role of public 
interest groups and the media.  Mr. Knight wrote, produced and 
directed the 1994 FRC video documentary about Alfred Kinsey, <I>The 
Children of Table 34.</I>

<p>

Prior to joining FRC, Mr. Knight headed a similar program as Senior 
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.  
That program examined federal policies that undermine the traditional 
values of family sovereignty, religious freedom, property rights, 
individual responsibility and the idea of limited government.

<p>

While at Heritage, Mr. Knight authored studies on the 
<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95a1cu.html">National Endowment for the 
Arts</A>, the U.S. Labor Department's regulatory disputes with the 
Salvation Army, the federal role in early childhood education, and 
the debate over the exemption of women from military combat roles. 
He testified before the U.S. Senate's Labor and Human Resources 
Committee in July 1994 as well as the Presidential Commission on the 
Assignment of Women in the Armed Services in 1992, and was an expert 
witness in the 1993 Colorado legal case dealing with Amendment 2, 
which barred cities from extending special civil rights protections 
based on sexual orientation.  He also testified in January 1995 before 
a House Appropriations subcommittee concerning the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting and at a CPB public hearing in Washington in 
January 1994.

<p>

Before joining Heritage in September 1990, Mr. Knight was a Media 
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where he 
researched and began writing a book on cultural relativism.

<p>

Mr. Knight was a news editor and writer with the <I>Los Angeles 
Times</I>, where he worked for seven years prior to his Hoover 
fellowship.  During his 15 years in journalism, Mr. Knight has 
written for <I> The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Chicago 
Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Washington Times, 
San Francisco Chronicle, Orange County Register</I> and other 
publications.  He has appeared on the <i>CBS Evening News, NBC 
Nightly News</i>, ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, NPR's <i>All Things 
Considered</i>, CNN's <i>Sonya Live</i>, CNBC'S <i>McLaughlin</i>, 
NBC's <i>A Closer Look</i>, NPR's <i>Fresh Air,</i> a PBS special 
on the arts and other television and radio broadcasts.

<p>

Mr. Knight worked for the <I>Fort Lauderdale News/Sun Sentinel</I> 
as a weekend project coordinator and copy editor, with the 
<I>Maryland Gazette </I>as assistant editor and the <I>Annapolis 
Evening Capital</I> as a reporter, and as a reporter and later 
editor of the <I>Maryland Coast Press</I>.

<p>

Mr. Knight has a Master's degree and a Bachelor of Science degree 
in political science from American University in Washington, D.C.

</font></center>
<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="compact"><center><h1>An American Compact</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>O</font>ne year after the Republican Contract with America, 
FRC President Gary Bauer has written a book in which he announces &quot;A 
Compact with Our Fellow Americans.&quot; Like the GOP Contract,
this Compact is an effort to put down on paper the goals of a movement. 
It follows in the long tradition of &quot;getting it in writing&quot; which 
has characterized our people's history, from Magna Carta to the U.S. 
Constitution.  Like the Contract, too, it contains 10 key items and invites 
supporters to sign on.
<p>
But the Compact differs in that it seeks to go beyond reforms to be enacted 
by Congress. Rather, it emphasizes actions which Americans can take in their 
homes, churches and communities, even if reform is thwarted in Congress. 
The Compact also differs in that any American, regardless of party ties, 
can freely subscribe to it.  The &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; 
touches on what Alexis de Tocqueville called the &quot;habits of the heart&quot;
which define and preserve us as a free people.
<p>
<center><h3>What We Want</h3></center>
<p>
The Compact is part of Gary Bauer's new book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams:
A Vision for America</i>. The book is being published this month by Focus 
on the Family. <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is an effort to go directly to 
Americans, to appeal to their hearts, <i>without the reinterpretation and
distortion of the major media</i>. It seeks to answer the question so often 
asked by brusque reporters, but which is also asked with sincerity by many 
of our fellow citizens:  &quot;What do you people want?&quot;
<p>
Bauer states the case for a pro-family America.  He tackles head-on
not only the issues which shape our political choices, but, more importantly, 
those cultural questions, beliefs and actions which determine whether our 
American experiment in ordered liberty will survive at all.  Despite
the facts that we are not at war and that Wall Street's Dow Jones
Index has been daily reaching new highs, most people think our country is 
on the wrong track.
<p>
Bauer recently spoke to this anxiety when he told Dan Rather: &quot;I 
want to see an America where I don't have to worry about date rape when my 
daughter goes out for the first time at college. I want an America where, 
when a young man pledges to love and honor her for the rest of their lives, 
there is a good chance he means it.  I want a country where children come 
first again and where virtue is honored, a place where values matter and 
the American Dream is still real.&quot;
<p>
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is not just a policy manual.  It goes behind
today's headlines and tomorrow's talk shows to explore the reasons why 
conservatives defend the family as the fundamental unit of society. It 
describes in detail what this nation would look like if the pro-family
cause were to triumph.  It seeks to summarize the aspirations of families 
and to quell the fears of citizens who have been urged by the polarizing 
media to view &quot;family values&quot; with grave suspicion.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>&quot;MOVE BEYOND<br>
BREAD-ALONE POLITICS...&quot;</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
Even though the book includes over 100 public policy recommendations,
it ultimately resists the temptation to put &quot;our trust in princes,&quot; 
as if the cure for America's ills could be found in Washington. It challenges 
our national leadership to move beyond &quot;bread-alone&quot; politics.  It
includes some thoughtful questions for citizens to ask all candidates
who seek power over us, giving pro-family Americans the chance to shape 
public debate.
<p>
<center><h3>Getting the Word Out</h3></center>
<p>
Look for <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America</i> at your local
Christian bookstore, or use the enclosed card to order from us.  Urge your 
neighborhood group, your church, your public library to obtain copies. 
Share them with family and friends who may be sympathetic but skeptical. 
This is a year of decision.  The decisions that are made will shape the world 
our children inherit.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Kinsey's Pedo-File.</b>  U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) has introduced
a bill, with over 40 cosponsors, calling for federal investigation into the 
infamous Kinsey sex studies.  The &quot;Child Protection and Ethics in 
Education Act&quot; also calls for a cut-off of federal funds to programs 
that use the Kinsey research uncritically.  Media attention continues
to build regarding Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft's admission that 
a key table on child sexuality was based on the records of a single pedophile. 
FRC has publicly called on the Institute to identify all of its pedophile 
sources.
<p>
<b>In the Dark.</b> What had originally been slated as a House hearing
to expose &quot;the homosexual agenda in schools&quot; turned into a 
mostly watered-down exercise on &quot;parents, schools and values.&quot; 
The Dec. 5 and 6 hearing drew little media coverage.  Virtually
ignored was shocking testimony by avowed lesbian Claire Connelly of 
Ventura County, California, who gave evidence that millions of taxpayer 
dollars' worth of AIDS programming is being hijacked by homosexual activist
groups. The hearing was held by the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations.
<p>
<b>Not with My Kid.</b>  A hearing was held in November on the Family
Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 1271), which requires researchers to get 
written parental permission before administering surveys to children. 
FRC's Robert Knight supported the bill in testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs.  Knight said the law is needed because 
some researchers are prying into family matters and/or asking children 
graphic questions about sex. The FRC video about Alfred Kinsey, <i>The 
Children of Table 34</i>, was submitted to the committee to illustrate 
research run amok.
<p><a name="abortion">
<b>Life Gains.</b> On Dec. 7, the Senate passed the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, 54-44.  Since the Senate-passed version has been amended slightly, 
a final version still must be approved by the House, possibly by the end of 
January.  After final congressional approval, the bill will go to
President Clinton, who threatens to veto it.  While thousands of Americans 
are calling the White House about this legislation, it is also important to 
educate your neighbors by writing letters to the editor and calling talk 
radio programs.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Slippery Summit.</b> Ever since the 1989 governors' education summit
in Charlottesville, Va., produced the National Education Goals and 
prompted Goals 2000, Americans are rightly suspicious of such gatherings. 
When word got out last summer about a follow-up meeting to recommit to 
the national goals, the ensuing uproar scuttled the meeting. Now a summit 
is scheduled for March 26-27 in Palisades, New York.  Business leaders
have been invited to join governors to discuss opportunities for participation 
in the Goals 2000 school restructuring. Unfortunately, a new partner in a bad 
venture won't improve it.
<p>
<b>Holiday Spirit.</b> On Dec. 19, Andrei Codrescu, a commentator on
National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered</i>, said this about 
the Christian concept of Rapture: &quot;The evaporation of four
million who believe in this crap would leave the world a better
place.&quot;  The taxpayer-funded NPR issued an apology. The week 
before Christmas, NPR also devoted considerable air time to commentators 
who tried to debunk Christianity.  And it was business as usual over 
at PBS, which re-aired the sexually explicit homosexual series <i>Tales 
of the City</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="npr">
<b>New Allies?</b> While the fate of the GOP's $500 per child tax credit
remains tied up in the budget deadlock, the National Parenting Association 
(NPA), a liberal academic group, has begun to lobby for pro-family tax cuts. 
On Dec. 15, an NPA youth violence task force hosted testimony
from representatives of Promise Keepers, the Christian pro-fatherhood
group that reached 826,000 men in 1995.  Meanwhile, a new Heritage Foundation 
study shows that the Clinton family tax cut covers 23 million fewer children 
than the GOP proposal.
<p>
<b>Maine Rebounds.</b> Pro-family forces have won a big victory in the
Pine Tree State.  For the first time in 20 years, Maine legislators won't 
face homosexual rights legislation in 1996.  An openly lesbian state 
senator withdrew the bill, citing the need for &quot;healing&quot;
on the issue.  But the real reason was the bill's certain defeat.  In 
November, voters narrowly rejected a statewide referendum that would 
have struck down local gay rights laws.  Outspent 10 to one, pro-family 
forces still snagged 47 percent of the vote, sending lawmakers a message.
<p>
<b>Saving Marriages.</b> Divorce reform is gaining momentum in the new
year.  Michigan and Iowa are among states likely to consider bills that 
reintroduce the fault concept in contested cases where children are present. 
Randy Hekman, head of the Michigan Family Forum, a member of the Association 
of State Policy Councils, points out that under current law, &quot;I can 
divorce my wife of 26 years with less difficulty than I can fire a 
secretary I hired last week.&quot;

<p><a name="porn">
<h3>Cyberprogress</h3>
<p>
At the end of 1995, staff members for the House and Senate
conferees on the large telecommunications deregulation bill came to 
agreement on strong pornography restrictions, but only after a series 
of tough negotiations.  Leaving pornography unrestricted in cyberspace 
would be like leaving a loaded gun on a playground.  If the &quot;telecom
bill&quot; is passed, the anti-cyberporn language will help parents protect 
their children by making pornography inaccessible by children.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions as negotiated include:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of a court-approved indecency standard, defined in
the bill as an <b>&quot;image or other communication that, in context, 
depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs&quot;</b>;
<p>
<li>Indecent communications are available to adults but <b>barred
to children</b>;
<p>
<li>People are liable only for <b>knowing violations</b> of the law;
<p>
<li>Online service providers are not liable for violations beyond areas 
they own or control;
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws are left unchanged;
<p>
<li>Those making good faith efforts to keep pornography away
from children have a defense against prosecution.
</ul><p>
Contrary to much of the current rhetoric from civil libertarians,
the anti-cyberporn provisions could not be used to find Shakespeare or 
any other serious work of literature or art to be indecent. Adults with 
common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently offensive
materials which degrade women, harm children, and corrupt men.
Under the indecency standard, the courts will be obliged to evaluate 
material in its proper context.
<p>
A few other provisions of the bill remained unresolved as <i>Watch</i> 
went to press. Congressional leaders should make every effort to conclude 
these matters as soon as possible, so that we do not risk losing the 
opportunity to protect our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn.
<p>
FRC's legal policy director took part in the negotiations leading to 
these provisions.  In the past, telecommunications reform has happened once 
a generation. FRC will continue to monitor this legislation in the days 
to come.

<h3>FRC: Ready and Abel</h3>
<p>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) is challenging the Clinton
administration's military personnel policies in the courts.  On Dec. 5, the 
MRP had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. 
Thomasson is an avowed homosexual who wants the military's ban declared 
unconstitutional.  The MRP defended the law's intended meaning, while
the U.S. Justice Department hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty 
regulations.  A decision is expected in April.
<p>
Last summer, the MRP filed a brief in <i>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</i>, which
involves six avowedly homosexual service members.  This case was scheduled 
for oral argument in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Dec. 
19.  That hearing was delayed after a Clinton-appointed judge was reminded 
that he had made a biased comment about the issue.  The hearing was re-set 
for mid-January with a decision expected this spring.  This case will
compete with <i>Thomasson</i> for a high court hearing next year.
<p>
On other fronts, the MRP worked with key members of Congress
to close a loophole in President Clinton's regulations on homosexuals. 
In response to Hill queries, the Pentagon's general counsel wrote a 
memo to the services clarifying Clinton's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations which say that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is not a bar to 
military service. The memo was necessary because last summer a Navy 
administrative board used the faulty regulations to retain an avowed lesbian 
who promised to avoid homosexual acts.
<p>
Meanwhile, on Dec. 15, the MRP filed a Supreme Court brief in
<i>U.S.A. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</i> (the Virginia Military Institute 
case).  The Clinton administration wants the high court to impose a 
&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard which would make all classifications 
by gender very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would 
amount to back-door adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, reviving old 
debates about everything from the Boy Scouts to unisex bathrooms. It would 
also remove most gender-based exemptions in the military, like women serving
in infantry units.  The FRC brief argues that gender classifications
should be subject to a less exacting standard.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Hope Is a Hand-up</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>J</font>ust before Christmas, Family Research Council hosted 
an important event in Washington.  It was a one-day conference, with 
distinguished speakers like authors Michael Novak and Dr. Marvin
Olasky.  The conference was devoted to the tragedy of poverty, with a 
close look at the tricky question of welfare reform.
<p>
I'm more convinced than ever that we must look with new eyes at
the scale of this tragedy.  It's really not enough to say that certain 
kinds of welfare reform will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms 
with the degree of suffering that is happening right now -- and not just 
suffering from material want, but from the sense of purposelessness that
saps the human spirit.
<p>
Those of us who believe most fiercely in the durability of traditional
values are precisely the ones to stand up now and say that every individual 
has qualities that no welfare system should be allowed to destroy. FRC 
recognizes that the best and most compassionate help comes from
private individuals who build personal relationships and offer
material support simultaneously. A hand-up not a handout. The premise is 
that needy individuals are not &quot;clients,&quot; but fellow human
beings.
<p>
America cannot implement neat, clean, top-down policies that will
jumpstart a network of caring in every community.  Instead, each of us must 
take direct action to heal the hurt -- not at the ballot box, but in our 
neighborhoods and communities as we minister daily to needy individuals.
<p>
One happy byproduct is that our own children, by watching our
example, will grow to appreciate what is great and good.  Even strong 
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help pattern 
right habits of the heart.
<p>
FRC is taking the initiative to encourage a new ethic of caring
because, I believe, social conservatives are the very people who have the 
idealism and initiative to build up a new network of helping institutions. 
As we have begun to speak out, we have discovered that the scale of the
crisis is an unprecedented opportunity for us to demonstrate, in full 
technicolor action, a fundamental truth:  Traditional values are traditional 
because they are functional.

When nothing else moves the needle, God's ways work.  His love
binds up wounds.  Our service to those who are hurting is one of the most 
obvious means we have at our disposal to let earth know what heaven looks like. 
God's love looks most beautiful, in fact, against a backdrop of despair.

Dr. Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids Hope USA, tells a story about
one small step in a child's journey to God.  Kids Hope USA aims to link adult 
volunteers in one-to-one relationships with at-risk children. This Christmas 
season, one volunteer took &quot;her child&quot; to see a Christmas pageant
at her church that included a living nativity.  As Mary, Joseph,
and the baby Jesus took their places, the child Amanda turned to her new 
friend and asked with wide eyes, &quot;Is this real?&quot;  The volunteer 
replied, &quot;Oh yes, Amanda, it's very real.&quot;
<p>
That moment almost undoubtedly left a mark on Amanda's soul. In time, 
I suspect, she will be much more likely to regard that scene as real 
because one of God's loving servants was sitting by her side.

Freshmen members of the House of Representatives are in the media
glare as the budget dispute continues between Congress and the White House. 
The first-termers have been called both &quot;principled citizen 
legislators&quot; and &quot;inflexible extremists.&quot; What's the 
reality?
<p>
Nearly all of the freshmen have strongly endorsed term limits
and committed to do what they think is right, regardless of short-term 
political consequences. They want a balanced budget and tax relief for 
America's families.  Their insistence on these policies led to stronger 
agreements with the Senate than first seemed possible.  They have been 
just as tough in negotiations with the White House.
<p>
Moreover, despite President Clinton's opposition, the freshmen
have helped to restore two abortion limitations that were overturned 
during the last Congress: limits on abortion funding through federal 
health insurance programs and a ban on elective abortions in overseas 
military hospitals.
<p>
Freshmen House members also helped sidetrack a bill to fully fund
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).  Their efforts forced the House 
leadership to zero out NEA funding within two years.
<p>
The principles of this freshman class will be further demonstrated
in 1996 as they strive to move parental rights and religious liberties 
legislation through Congress. They are truly making a difference on issues 
vital to pro-family Americans.

<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n a sweeping victory for families, Congress recently 
passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including provisions protecting
children from computer pornography.  The Telecom Act extends current
child protection laws to cyberspace, using the court-approved
&quot;indecency&quot; standard to keep patently offensive material
away from minors.  The cyberporn provisions punish only knowing
violations, while preserving existing electronic mail privacy
laws.
<p>
The significance of the new law's computer porn section cannot
be overstated.  It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity
to set ground rules for the next great communications medium.
Pornographers have been flooding this promising technology, and
the new Telecom Act comes not a moment too soon.
<p>
<center><h3>ACLU Logs In</h3></center>
<p>
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to strike
down the computer pornography section as unconstitutional.  Clearly,
the ACLU is fighting a losing battle.  Time and again, the courts
have upheld the constitutionality of &quot;indecency&quot; restrictions
in other contexts, most recently regarding dial-a-porn services.
FRC will file its own brief in response to the ACLU challenge.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>ACLU FIGHTS A<br>
LOSING BATTLE</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
The battle now shifts to the Clinton administration, whose
resolve in defending the law is questionable.  Last April, President
Clinton voiced concern that children &quot;may be exposed to things
on computer, which in some ways are more powerful, more raw and
more inappropriate than those things from which we protect them
when they walk in a 7-Eleven.&quot;  Clinton declared, &quot;I
do not believe in any way, shape or form that we should be able
to do on e-mail, or through the electronic superhighway anything
beyond what we could elsewhere.  I think the First Amendment has
to be uniform in its application.&quot;
<p>
However, in recent days the Clinton administration has appeared
to retreat from this resolve.  The floundering is reminiscent
of the notorious <I>Knox</I> case, where the administration tried
to weaken the federal child pornography law it was bound to defend.
Although Congress rebuffed that attempt, fear remains that the
administration might try a similar tactic again.
<p>
Objections to the new cyberporn law have less to do with
free speech than with arrogance and greed.  The &quot;online elite&quot;
know that if this new medium is to be truly open to a diverse
community, all members of that community will deserve respect,
including children.  Even with the new law, parents must be ever
vigilant in ensuring that cyberporn remains off-limits to their
children.
<p>
<center><h3>Nixing PX Porn</h3></center>
<p>
FRC continues to fight pornography on other fronts.  Last
month at the Supreme Court, FRC filed a legal brief in <I>Alliance
for Community Media v. F.C.C.</I>, a case challenging the regulation
of pornographic programs on cable television access channels.
The challenged law would simply give private cable operators
the ability to limit indecent programs.  It would relieve operators
of the current law requiring them to show everything, no matter
how offensive. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs charge that restoring
a cable operator's right to decide against airing indecent programs
amounts to indirect government censorship.  FRC supports the right
of private cable operators to reject &quot;nude talk shows&quot;
and &quot;amateur porn hours&quot; on access channels.  Oral argument
at the Supreme Court was set for Feb. 21.
<p>
Pornography in the military has been another flashpoint.
For years, the U.S. military has been the nation's largest porn
purveyor, stocking military exchanges with tax-free smut worth
millions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, in recent years the military
has been plagued by sexual misconduct and assault.  New Jersey
Rep. Christopher Smith is drafting a bill to prohibit the sale
of pornography at military facilities worldwide.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Over the last few months, tremendous progress has occurred
in the fight against pornography, thanks largely to grassroots
support.  Your continued involvement will help keep these gains
intact.  Insist that child protection laws apply consistently
to all areas of society, including the Internet.  Urge your members
of Congress to support the pending Smith bill on military porn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="believers">
<B>Forsaken Brethren.</B>  FRC President Gary Bauer testified
on Feb. 15 before the House Subcommittee on International Operations
and Human Rights regarding anti-Christian persecution overseas.
Bauer testified that this persecution takes many forms, from
harassment of worshippers to, in Ethiopia, actual crucifixion.
Abuses seem to be especially prevalent in certain Moslem countries.
Bauer called for a more coherent response from the U.S. Government
and from U.S. religious leaders:  &quot;How much longer,&quot;
he said, &quot;can we allow persecuted Christians overseas to
call out, 'Why have you forsaken us?'&quot;
<p>
<B>CAREERS Update.</B>  The National Governors Association recently
released a statement urging final passage of the CAREERS bill
(H.R. 1617) within 30 days.  Progress in a House-Senate conference
committee to combine CAREERS with the Senate's Workforce Development
Act (S. 143) has been slow due to major differences between the
bills, which would consolidate job training programs.  The bills'
extensive Labor Market Information System and implementation of
a skill certificate system could threaten workers' economic freedom.
Governors favor consolidation, which gives them more authority
over state job training and economic development.
<p>
<B>Pro-Life Progress.</B> A short-term spending bill signed by
President Clinton on Jan. 26 included three pro-life measures.
They are:  a ban on federal funds for the experimental creation
of human embryos; a ban on federal funding of abortions for prison
inmates, except in the case of rape or life of the mother; and
a compromise restriction on international population funds.  The
compromise will bar funding until July 1 for organizations that
perform or promote abortions overseas, but allow funding thereafter
at reduced levels from 1995 spending.  Pro-life members of Congress
continue to seek permanent restrictions.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<B>Innocent as Charged.</B> After a more than year-long federal
grand jury investigation, the Clinton Justice Department has found
no evidence of a national conspiracy to attack abortion clinics.
However, Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed to continue the
probe, and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) has called for congressional
hearings on the issue.  Meanwhile, federal and state prosecutors
have used the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) act
to charge two peaceful pro-lifers, sidewalk counselors Carmen
Vazquez and Bobby Riley, with &quot;obstructing&quot; and 
&quot;interfering&quot; with women seeking abortions.
<p>
<B>Drug Fighter.</B> President Clinton has selected a get-tough
soldier to lead our nation's battle against drugs.  During his
State of the Union address, Clinton announced his decision to
tap Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey to replace drug czar Lee Brown,
who is now teaching in Texas.  Gen. McCaffrey is an expert on
narcotics trafficking who returns to Washington from a command
in Panama, where he has overseen U.S. cooperation with Latin American
and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction since
February 1994. Drug abuse among American youth con-tinues to
rise.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="baer">
<B>Baer Backs &quot;Mule.&quot;</B> Federal Judge Harold Baer,
Jr. provoked a firestorm Jan. 24 when he threw out the drug trafficking
conviction of Carol Bayless.  Bayless was driving a car with 80
pounds of cocaine and heroin in the trunk. Two accomplices ran
when police observed them.  Judge Baer,  a Clinton appointee,
said: &quot;Residents in this neighborhood tend to regard police
officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.  Had the men not run
when the cops began to stare at them, it would have been unusual.&quot;
Bayless had confessed to being a regular drug courier (&quot;mule&quot;).
<p>
<B>PC &quot;Volunteers.&quot;</B>  Mandatory voluntarism takes
the spirit out of serving, argue many parents and secondary school
students.  Graduation requirements for &quot;volunteering&quot;
are prompted by Goals 2000, which encourages community service.
But what some programs call service is actually political activism.
Others exclude religious service activities.  The conflict over
mandatory service may soon reach the U.S. Supreme Court if a New
York decision upholding a service requirement is appealed.  Federal
parental rights legislation (S. 984, H.R. 1946) could provide
a remedy by defining parental authority in school matters.
<p>
<B>Army Salvation.</B> An Army wife, Tambra Hartmann, lost her
license to run a home-based day-care service on a military post
because she said grace with the children over meals and played
Christian music.  The children's parents selected the service
in part because it was faith-based.   Last November, the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Army overstepped
its authority and violated the families' First Amendment freedoms.
The Army has changed the regulation to permit faith elements
as long as child-care providers inform parents of that fact before
enrollment.

<h3>Wedding Bans</h3>
<p>
Acting before Hawaiian courts mandate homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;
which may occur in July, pro-family activists nationwide are working
to protect the definition of marriage.
<p>
In California, the state assembly voted 41 to 31 on Jan.
31 to prohibit the recognition of same-sex relationships as marriage.
A tougher vote is expected in the liberal Senate.  Utah enacted
a law in 1995 that defines marriage as the union of &quot;one
man and one woman&quot; and bars recognition of same-sex nuptials.
Other states considering such measures: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.  In Maine,
a marriage protection bill was introduced but withdrawn after
a lesbian legislator withdrew her own homosexual rights bill.
In Nebraska, a bill legalizing same-sex marriages has been introduced.
<p>
At the national level, a federal bill is being written to
reinforce the &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition in all
policies, including Social Security and the military.  The tentative
title is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and a sponsor was
being sought at press time.
<p>
The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated.  If homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; becomes law in Hawaii and is imposed on all
other states through the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution,
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexuality, schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital sex,
and churches will be pushed into a religious &quot;ghetto,&quot;
where pressure will mount for conformity to civil law.  Redefining
marriage would redefine the family, giving homosexuals an uncontested
&quot;right&quot; to adopt children.
<p>
Citizens can do two things to preserve marriage:  1) contact
your state legislators and urge them to support current legislation
or to introduce a bill protecting marriage; 2) ask your congressman
and U.S. Senators to cosponsor the eventual federal bill.  The
Capitol Hill switchboard number is (202) 225-3121 or (202) 224-3121.

Marriage (513) 733-8908.

<h3>Wobbling on Welfare</h3>
<p>
The promise to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; remains
a popular talking point, but on Jan. 9 President Clinton vetoed
the welfare bill passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
The nation's Governors have now advanced their own welfare
reform package, and regrettably they have chosen to abandon serious
attempts to reduce illegitimacy.  The House and Senate agreed
last year to prohibit states from using federal funds to increase
welfare payments to women who bear additional children while on
welfare, but would have allowed states to opt out of the prohibition.
<p>
While erasing the focus on illegitimacy, the Governors proposed
<I>adding</I> an extra $4 billion in child care funding.  Their
recommendation would increase spending on day care 49% more than
current law, without spending a penny on abstinence programs to
help reduce out-of-wedlock births.  The emphasis on child care
is ironic, since the Governors also moved to weaken the work requirements
passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
In a letter to House colleagues, Congressman Jim Talent (R-Mo.)
argued that the last time Congress adopted a welfare plan proposed
by the Governors, a Democrat from Arkansas rode to the White House
partly on the strength of his pledge to fix the mess.  If the
Congress listens to the Governors' advice this year, it will have
committed itself to spending over half a trillion dollars to subsidize
fatherlessness through cash benefits, day care, job training,
and other services.
<p>
A recent FRC poll shows that three out of four Americans
believe that welfare encourages illegitimacy and, by a ratio of
two to one, that reducing illegitimacy is more important than
merely encouraging single mothers to support themselves.  A hefty
84% of Americans support a family cap, and an overwhelming majority
believe that work requirements should focus last on mothers with
preschool-aged children.  Both provisions would help reduce the
Governors' incentive to capture new federal dollars for child
care -- and would allay our concerns about leaving children, yet
again, at the mercy of public institutions.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Foster Has a Future</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
In his State of the Union Address on Jan. 23, President Clinton
made an appeal to pro-family Americans.  He talked about balancing
the budget, reforming welfare, attacking drug abuse, and reducing
the rate of teen pregnancy, among other things.  For Drug Czar,
the President made a choice American families warmly applauded,
Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey.  Now comes Clinton's Teenage Pregnancy
Czar, and the ovation is over:  Dr. Henry Foster, Planned Parenthood
advocate extraordinaire and failed nominee for Surgeon General,
is back in the saddle.
<p>
Almost a year ago, President Clinton tapped Dr. Foster to
replace Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General, saying that he wanted
Foster's Nashville-based teen pregnancy program, &quot;I Have
A Future,&quot; replicated throughout the nation.  But part of
the reason Foster was rejected as Surgeon General was that his
program, like all contraceptive-based programs, proved a dismal
failure.  According to an evaluation by the Carnegie Corporation,
a program underwriter, participants in &quot;I Have a Future&quot;
actually had <I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those
outside the program.
<p>
This is not the kind of leadership that America wants or
needs to help combat teen pregnancy.  This is not the kind of
program that will help reach the President's stated goal of reducing
the teen pregnancy rate by one-third over the next 10 years. 
And this is surely not the kind of approach that will help our
children grow up to be responsible and mature adults.
<p>
The research is crystal clear.  Teenagers' best safeguard
against having or causing an out-of-wedlock pregnancy is to have
two loving parents involved in their lives.  But it's also important
to create a culture where the values that parents teach their
children are reinforced outside the home.  Several abstinence
programs have done just that, with excellent results.
<p>
For example, only 1.1 percent of participants in the Washington,
D.C.-based <I>Best Friends</I> program became pregnant, as opposed
to 25 percent of other girls in the city.  The abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> helped to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in Jacksonville,
Florida, by 35 percent just three years after it was implemented.
Examples of other successful abstinence programs abound.
<p>
Tragically, the President has chosen to support ideology
over progress.  The Foster task force has been christened the
&quot;National Campaign to Reduce Teen Pregnancy.&quot;  Reducing
pregnancy among unmarried teens is a laudable goal.  But to reach
it we must have a sustained reversal of the sexual activity that
haunts the young with unprecedented rates of pregnancy, abortion,
disease and emotional heartbreak.  Unfortunately, the Foster
group has already admitted that it intends to promote contraception
rather than abstinence.

While raising children well is a tough job, it's not impossible.
In truth, the teen pregnancy rate has been declining for the
last two years because more teens are choosing abstinence despite
all of the federal projects and cultural pressures promoting the
contrary.  Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the drop in teen pregnancy rates reflects
a rising number of teens choosing to abstain from sex.
<p>
The familiar Scripture says, &quot;Train up a child in the
way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;
(Proverbs 22:6).  Last June the U.S. Senate reviewed Dr. Foster's
credentials and told the President this <I>isn't</I> the way
we should go.  But the President has refused to turn from his
old friend.  So now it appears that Henry Foster has a future
in government.  It's our nation's young people for whom the future
now looks a little bleaker.

family, marriage and divorce, family trends, and human sexuality.

<p>

A 1993 recipient of an Amy Foundation Writing Award, Mattox's writings 
have appeared in: 

<p><ul>

<li>national publications like <I>
<a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/matoxdoc.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>, 
USA Today, The Washington Post,  The Washington Times</I>, and 
<I>Reader's Digest</I>;

<p>

<li>regional newspapers, including <I>The Miami Herald, The Cleveland 
Plain-Dealer, The Atlanta Journal, The Tampa Tribune, The Detroit News, 
The Orange County Register, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Houston 
Post, The San Diego Union, The Sacramento Bee, The Arizona Republic,</I>

</ul><p>

Mattox has testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, the U.S. 
House Ways and Means Committee, the U.S. Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee, the U.S. Labor Department, and the U.S. House

Conference, the Institute for American Values, and others.  

<p>

Mattox also has served as project director for three national public 
opinion surveys, a series of six Capitol Hill briefings on The Family 
Time Famine, and two public education advertising campaigns (one 
which promotes responsible fatherhood and one which touts the benefits 
of saving sex for marriage).

<p>

Prior to joining FRC in 1985, Mattox worked for U.S. Congressman 
Elliott H. Levitas and U.S. Senator Sam Nunn.

<p>

Mattox graduated <I>summa cum laude</I> from the University of 
Georgia's School of Journalism, and has done graduate work in the

<CENTER><H2>A Lesson for Allison</H2>
by <br>
Wlliam R. Mattox JR. <p>
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<BR>
THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 1994<P>

</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
	I am not the kind of guy who normally takes part in feminist "consciousness-raising" efforts.  But I am participating in Take Your Daughter to Work Day today because I have an eight-year-old daughter whose self-esteem matters a great deal to me.
<P>
	For the uninitiated, Take Your Daughter To Work Day is an annual event dreamed up by the Ms. Foundation in response to research showing that girls' self-esteem often plummets during the fragile pre-teen and early adolescent years.  By exposing young girls to successful women in the workplace, organizers hope that girls will learn to think more highly of females in general and of themselves in particular.
<P>
	I have a great day planned for my daughter, Allison.  This morning, I plan to take her by the offices of two women whose job it is to meet regularly with members of Congress and other public officials.  Then, I plan to have her talk with a young woman who just finished graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and is now serving as a health policy analyst.  At lunch, she'll chat with a woman who does some public speaking, and another who crunches numbers in our accounting department.  Finally, in the late afternoon, Allison is scheduled to meet with a woman who used to practice law and now manages a bevy of staff writers.
<P>
	I am sure all of this will be interesting to Allison.  But the time I am most looking forward to is the ride home.  For it is then that I plan to point out to my daughter that some of the exciting tasks carried out by my female colleagues in the workplace are tasks my wife performed in jobs she held prior to motherhood.  She used to meet regularly with congressmen and senators.  She used to do some writing and public speaking.  And she has a Phi Beta Kappa key from hr college days.
<P>
	After I remind my daughter of these things, I plan to turn to her and look her in the eye and say, "Allison, you must be a very special young girl.  Your mother could be using her talents and skills in all sorts of jobs in the workplace, but she has chosen instead to use them at home teaching you.  She must love you very, very much and think you are very, very important."
<P>
	Somehow, I think that at that moment my daughter' self-esteem will rise to a level heretofore unimagined by the organizers of Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  And for that I owe debt of gratitude to my wife, whose esteem-building job as a mother at home rarely receives the public esteem it deserves.
<P>

<center><h1>CONGRESS ADVANCES PRO-FAMILY AGENDA</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom defending marriage to fighting to prevent the 
killing of the unborn late in pregnancy to presenting an unprecedented
balanced budget with family tax relief, the 104th Congress took
historic steps for America's families, according to Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Missions Met</h3></center>

<p>

To be sure, the 104th Congress did not achieve all of its
objectives.  But the addition of a large group of conservative
freshmen substantially changed the legislative agenda.  These
freshmen apparently had an impact on national policy even before
they took office.  On Nov. 10, 1994 -- two days after the election
that reversed control of Congress -- the Justice Department abandoned
its two-year effort to weaken the interpretation of a child pornography
statute.  According to a new book by former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders, the election results also prompted the administration
to reverse a decision to provide clean needles to drug addicts.

<p>

The new chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the
Constitution, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), was in the forefront
of congressional initiatives to defend the traditional definition
of marriage and ban partial-birth abortions.  Canady held very
illuminating hearings in his subcommittee, helping to set the
stage for overwhelming House approval of the Defense of Marriage
Act and the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.

<p>

Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the Senate sponsor of the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), fended off an effort by Sens. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others to attach the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and other pro-homosexual
amendments to DOMA.  The Human Rights Campaign, a major homosexual
rights advocacy group, took credit for developing this amendment
strategy to &quot;derail&quot; the Defense of Marriage Act, which
they alleged was &quot;hate-driven.&quot;  Nickles and Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) negotiated an agreement that provided
for a clean vote on DOMA, followed by an up or down vote on Sen.
Kennedy's ENDA proposal.

<p>

An overwhelming majority of senators agreed with the argument
that marriage was not instituted to 'discriminate' against homosexuals,
but rather to unite one man and one woman and provide a strong
foundation for the nurturing of children.  President Clinton signed
DOMA into law at 12:50 a.m. on Sept. 21.  Despite last-minute
phone calls from the president to wavering senators, the Kennedy
homosexual jobs proposal came up one vote short, 49-50.

<center><i><font size=+2>
"THE 104TH CONGRESS<br>
TOOK HISTORIC STEPS."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Congress produced strong majorities in favor of the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban, but on Sept. 26 the Senate fell eight votes short
of the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
Despite administration objections, Congress did succeed in enacting
five pro-life provisions as amendments to spending bills.  One
of these measures protects medical schools from the loss of federal
funds if they refuse to provide abortion training. Another restores
a limitation on funding of abortions through federal employees'
health insurance programs.

<p>

<center><h3>More Vetoes</h3></center>

<p>

Several new anti-pornography bills were enacted and signed
into law by the president, but they will face difficult battles
in the courts.  Congress passed a balanced budget and family tax
relief package, but it was vetoed.  A modified welfare reform
package was enacted into law after stronger measures were twice
vetoed.

<p>

Line-item veto authority was provided to the president, effective
January 1997.  Vice President Gore suggested on a weekend news
program that this would give the administration leverage to press
Congress to liberalize welfare policies.

<p>

Since every new Congress starts with a clean slate, the policies
enacted during the past two years will be subject to revision
by the next Congress and president.

<p>

<center><h3>Whose Children Are They?</h3></center>

<p>

Parents, have you encountered
incidents where your rights to parent your children have been
infringed upon, at schools or elsewhere?  Please send all stories
to the attention of FRC congressional liason Jacqueline Halbig,
who is compiling these incidents as part of a research project.
(For FRC's new address, see p. 4.)

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>FDA Checks Parents.</b> House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) recently held hearings into why the FDA
refuses to allow the marketing of an Atlanta mother's drug testing
kit to parents who want to test their children.  FDA regulations
label the kit (a plastic cup and a shipping box) as a &quot;Class
III&quot; medical device, equivalent to an MRI or  pacemaker.
Even though businesses and athletic teams use the same kit, the
FDA claims it &quot;is concerned about issues such as anonymity,
confidentiality, coercion, and family discord.&quot;  Will the
same considerations govern FDA rulings on RU-486?

<p><a name="ex-gay">

<b>Hope for Homosexuals.</b> On Oct. 10, FRC co-sponsored a press
conference for the Second Annual Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
(Oct. 11) and the new support group, Parents, Family and Friends
of Ex-Gays (PFOX).  Hosted by Michael Johnston, a former homosexual
who is HIV-positive, the event was taped for C-SPAN.  FRC Cultural
Studies Director Bob Knight also spoke, along with <I>Lambda Report</I>
editor Peter LaBarbera, the Philadelphia Family Policy Council's
Bill Devlin, Tom and Ann Taylor, who have a homosexual son, and
ex-homosexuals Anthony Falzarano and Jane Boyer.

<p>

<b>Refuge for Abortion Victims.</b> Several immigration provisions
were rolled into the FY 1997 Omnibus Appropriations package, including
a humanitarian measure which allows people fleeing from coercive
abortion policies to seek asylum in the United States.  Effective
immediately, asylum may be granted for up to 1,000 people per
year who have been forcibly aborted or involuntarily sterilized,
or have a well-founded fear of persecution under coercive population
control policies. This restores a similar policy which was effective
under the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<p>

<b>Immigrants and AIDS Treatment.</b> Congress dropped a provision
in its immigration legislation preventing taxpayer-funding of
HIV-AIDS treatment for legal and illegal aliens.  Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), chairmen of House and
Senate immigration subcommittees, said the change could encourage
&quot;thousands of HIV-infected aliens to seek asylum in the U.S.&quot;
Despite a 1993 law barring admission of HIV-positive immigrants,
earlier this year the White House directed the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to consider granting asylum to HIV-positive
individuals.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Elders on Drugs.</b> As Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders called
for a drug legalization study, favored giving needles to
addicts and advocated marijuana as medicine.  On Oct. 9, she blamed
the new teenage drug epidemic on easy-to-get marijuana and then
said pot &quot;probably causes very little problem to anyone.&quot;
Marijuana can be addictive, damages the immune system, causes
respiratory diseases and mental disorders, and impairs coordination
and judgment.

<p>

<b>Gagging Chaplains.</b> Air Force Reserve chaplain Fr. Vincent
Rigdon has filed a federal lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense
(<I>Rigdon v. Perry</I>) for interfering with his religious liberty
and free speech by issuing a &quot;gag order&quot; that bars religious
leaders from discussing specific legislation in sermons or counseling.
In June, a Pentagon directive to Catholic military chaplains
prohibited them from &quot;participating or urging others to participate&quot;
in a nationwide postcard mailing to Congress which supported a
vote to override the veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

<b>Bork's Beatitudes.</b> Will America survive?  Not without
strong churches, says Robert Bork, respected jurist and author
of the controversial new book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah: 
Modern Liberalism and American Decline.</I> Bork contends that
the loss of reliable standards of right and wrong has resulted
in a &quot;loss of nerve, which means the community cannot summon
the will to suppress&quot; many social ills such as pornography
and crime. &quot;The Church which ought to be shaping and influencing
culture is instead being influenced by culture,&quot; Bork says.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Insulting Hispanics.</b> Apparently, the Enola Gay controversy
taught the Smithsonian Institute little.  Hispanic Heritage Month,
which ended on Oct. 15, featured Andres Serrano, best known for
his vulgar and anti-Christian art.  (His creations include a crucifix
immersed in a jar of urine.)  The Hispanic community lacks not
for serious artists.  Selecting Serrano &quot;because of the body
of his work&quot; reveals the politically correct values of the
Smithsonian.  Such art merits no taxpayer money.  The real irony
is that Serrano would receive no support if his works glorified
Christian symbols.

<p><a name="pentagon">

<b>PX Porn Challenge.</b> Now that the sale of pornographic materials
at military stores has been prohibited, <I>Penthouse</I> publisher
Bob Guccione is challenging the 1997 Defense Authorization Bill,
claiming it is unconstitutional.  Guccione's magazine alone earned
$1.16 of the $4.6 million in 1995 sales at the Pentagon's worldwide
chain of tax-supported stores.  Mr. Guccione's real gripe with
the new law may be its threat to his revenues.  Getting the U.S.
government out of the porn business has been an accomplishment
10 years in the making.

<p>

<b>BULLETIN --</b> In education news, the CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)
died with the closing of the 104th Congress.  The issue of job
training reform will most likely be raised again in the 105th
Congress next year.

<h3>Katy Bar The Schoolhouse Door To Parents</h3>

<p>

Parents effectively lose their right to direct the upbringing
of their children when they drop them off at school, according
to one federal court judge.  Earlier this year, Judge Melinda
Harmon, appointed by President Bush, ruled that Katy Independent
School District in Texas did not violate parents' rights by allowing
Child Protective Services to interrogate a student without notifying
his parents, nor by instructing him to lie to his parents about
the incident.

<p>

Take, for example, the case of 6-year-old Jonathan Prevette,
who last month kissed a classmate in Lexington, N.C.  Such incidents
have a long history in schoolyards across America and, until now,
were brushed off as childhood innocence, or reprimanded by teachers
and principals after discussing the situation with parents.  But
this time it was called &quot;sexual harassment.&quot;  The &quot;culprit&quot;
was suspended for a misdemeanor he can't even spell.

<p>

What prompted such a response?  Perhaps it was a nudge from
the U.S. Education Department, which this summer distributed guidelines
urging schools to set up sexual harassment policies.  Schools
were warned that under Title IX &quot;gender equity&quot; provisions
for federally funded programs, they may be held liable for letting
&quot;sexual harassment&quot; among students go unnoticed.

<p>

With even admiring looks now considered &quot;sexual harassment,&quot;
it is no wonder a school would seek cover from lawsuits by laying
down a blanket prohibition against anything remotely affectionate.
Ironically, the very same federal Education Department has promoted
sex education schemes that push condoms and the like on boys and
girls at even younger ages.

<p>

Such cold, heavy-handed responses to children like Jonathan
Prevette will continue if federal court decisions shut parents
out and let a remote and liberal federal education bureaucracy
hand down one-size-fits-all policies.  Embracing parents, on the
other hand, would result in the improved discipline and academics
many schools now seek in vain.

<h3>A Duty to Die?</h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court has accepted two important cases concerning
doctor-aided suicide.  In <I>Glucksburg v. Washington</I>, the
Ninth Circuit federal court &quot;found&quot; a constitutional
&quot;liberty&quot; right for terminally-ill patients to be killed
by their doctors.  Judge Stephen Reinhardt explained that his
reasoning is &quot;identical&quot; to the Supreme Court abortion
cases of <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>.
These poisonous precedents live on, defending the destruction
of life.

<p>

The other case creates a constitutional right to be killed
by a doctor, not based on &quot;liberty&quot; but &quot;equality.&quot;
The Second Circuit federal court in <I>Vacco v. Quill</I> declared
that the New York law against causing or assisting suicide was
unconstitutional because it discriminates among terminally-ill
people.  According to the court, refusing artificial life support
and getting a lethal injection are equivalent, and since the former
is permitted, the latter may not be prohibited.

<p>

If these decisions are not overturned by the high court,
a &quot;right to die&quot; may soon become a &quot;duty to die&quot;
for those most in need.

<p>

A recent report on the Netherlands euthanasia experience
by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) provides a compelling context
for the current debate on doctor-assisted suicide in America.
Euthanasia of the terminally ill in the Netherlands has been
expanded since its inception in 1973 to permit the killing of
healthy people experiencing psychological distress.  Voluntary
euthanasia has given way to involuntary euthanasia, called &quot;termination
of the patient without explicit request.&quot;  In 1990, 1,000
people in the Netherlands were killed without their consent, 140
of whom were fully competent.

<p>

FRC is part of a broad coalition of groups urging the Court
to overturn the lower rulings, drafting <I>amicus</I> briefs detailing
the right of society to forbid euthanasia, and recounting the
tragedy of pre-Nazi Germany, where mercy killing was thought to
be the compassionate response to the plight of physically or mentally
disabled people, &quot;life unworthy of life.&quot;  Germany has
learned from its horrific mistakes, and now calls mercy killing
a crime against humanity.  Pray that the Supreme Court will not
sacrifice the lives of the infirm as they have done the lives
of the unborn.

<font size=+2><b><i>An Exercise of Citizenship</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>veryone needs to belong, to identify with something 
larger than self.  For some it is religion, for some it is a social 
construct, and for virtually all, it is national identity, citizenship, a
precious commodity involving rights, duties, and privileges.
I for one cannot imagine what it would be like to be the fabled
&quot;man without a country&quot; -- a man without citizenship.

<p>

Millions of people have left friends, family and their native
lands to immigrate, often at great personal risk, to the United
States.  Why?  Inscribed on the Statue of Liberty are the words,
&quot;Give me your tired, your poor; your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free. ...&quot;  That's it.  They come here for freedom.
Freedom of opportunity, of religion, from oppression, to raise
their families, to educate their children, to associate with friends
of their choice, and to achieve the American Dream.  They have
come because America is the land of the free.

<p>

Becoming an American involves more than a labeling process.
It implies adopting our language, customs, and national as well
as historical traditions.  It requires swearing allegiance to
the Constitution of the United States, renouncing fidelity to
any foreign state, and expressing willingness to serve this nation
as required by and under the law.

<p>

Recently, however, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen
has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  In the last 12 months, according
to published accounts, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
has conducted a full-court press to naturalize more than 1.2 million
new citizens.  Congressional hearings reveal that in the process,
longstanding rules have been bent, the citizenship test has been
simplified, citizenship has been granted to people who could not
speak English and, in many cases, criminal background checks may
have been bypassed.

<p>

Despite denial by the INS, evidence suggests that in at least
one case, hundreds of tests were submitted all of which were completed
in the same handwriting.  Extensive testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration alleges a White House-initiated,
election-year effort to dramatically accelerate the naturalization
of new immigrants prior to Nov. 5.

<p>

The blessings of this land have not been bought cheaply.
Millions have paid the ultimate price while defending our way
of life.  To grant citizenship cheaply to anyone who applies or
for political advantage is an insult to those who have served
this nation.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"THE BLESSINGS OF THIS<br>
LAND HAVE NOT BEEN<br>
BOUGHT CHEAPLY."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Every American is endowed with the God-given right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Among the privileges are
the freedom to participate in the social, economic, political,
religious and cultural aspects of the community.  No wonder people
around the globe aspire to come to our shores!

<p>

Rights are important, but there are obligations crucial to
the survival of a free society.  Citizenship imposes broad responsibilities
on our nation, our community, our neighbors and our families.
One of the most cherished of these is the obligation to vote.
This democratic republic will survive only if it is truly representative
of all the people, and that requires broad participation in the
political process.

<p>

Sadly, far too few Christians go to the polls.  Abraham Lincoln
believed elections to be so important that he offered furloughs
to soldiers who wanted to vote. Edmund Burke said, &quot;All it
takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
Now is not the time for any of us, whatever our heritage, to
lower the standards of good citizenship.  After all, we are men
and women <I>with</I> a country -- a country that needs us more
than ever.

This month marks a departure from the usual format of <i>Washington Watch</i>. While most families are beginning summer vacations from school, Congress is entering the heart of its regular legislative schedule.  This special issue of <i>Watch</i> is designed to bring you up to date on what FRC regards as the most important pro-family policy measures pending on Capitol Hill.
<p>
On the inside pages, you'll find a convenient "scorecard" on the legislative achievements of the 104th Congress.  You may want to keep a copy handy for future reference.  Feel free to duplicate copies of these pages as you see fit for your neighbors or your church.
Bulk copies of this issue of <i>Watch</i> are available on request.  Just dial 1-800-225-4008 for information.
<p>
And remember -- for current pro-family legislative information, updated every Friday, dial FRC at 1-202-783-HOME (a toll call).
<p>
<i>Watch</i> will return in its regular format in July.  In the meantime, drop me a note and let me know how well <i>Washington Watch</i> is serving your need for timely facts and findings about how the family fares in national policy. 
<p><hr width=50% size=3><p>
<font size=+2><b><i>Dear Reader:</i></b></font>
<p>Late last year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> asked me to write an essay on what pro-family Americans expected from the new Congress.  I was happy to do so, even though I had to begin my article with a concession.  The concession was this:  the new Congress should keep the promises made in the Republican Contract with America -- most of which involved economic and structural reforms -- then turn to the social agenda:  reversing the breakdown of the family, defunding our grossly mismanaged (and too often simply gross) arts agencies, protecting the sanctity of human life, reforming the education mess.
<p>
In the last four months, the pro-family movement has helped to implement a lot of reforms related to the budget and the economy.  Now it's time to deal with issues related to our families and values.  Patience may be its own reward, but in public policy, too much patience can be poison.  In my two decades in Washington, I have witnessed only a handful of opportunities for progress on a pro-family platform.  We are now in the midst of such an opportunity.  We can move forward and see dramatic policy change to strengthen the family unit morally, socially and economically.
<p>
Or we can see the opposite.  Because just as this opportunity is upon us, so too is there unprecedented danger to the family.  Every parent in America senses this fact.  To read a daily newspaper is to be bombarded with a hail of horrors.  To look at our nation's illegitimacy rate -- and to understand its correlation with youth crime -- is to recognize that America may be just a decade away from an explosion of street violence.  To see the staggering toll of abortions, the pressures on our court system to sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, and other anti-life trends, is to know that the nation is perilously close to complete dissolution of the Judeo-Christian consensus that has sustained it through the centuries.
<p>
A wise veteran on Capitol Hill put our situation to me bluntly.  For the first time since it has been his job to understand the pulse of the American people, he cannot tell which way this nation is headed.  In the next five years, he said, anything seems possible, from a religious and pro-family renaissance to an utter collapse of traditional values that brings on drug legalization, homosexual marriages, and all-pervasive pornography.  
<p>
Life and death truly have been set before us.  Which way we will choose?  What follows in this special edition of <i>Washington Watch</i> is an effort to lay out an agenda for <i>the way of life</i> -- an American way of life.  My hope is that you will share these pages with your friends, your neighbors and those with whom you attend church.  Each of us has the responsibility to take a clear look at the alternatives that lie before us -- before the window of opportunity is shut.

<p>
<i>Introduction:  The architecture of family freedom is no accident, even if, once upon a time in America, government officials almost instinctively adopted policies to protect family stability and promote civic character.  Today, both deliberate and unintentional assaults upon the family have multiplied.  But the structure of the family is written on the heart of humanity.  Lawmakers can ignore that God-given structure, but they cannot erase it.  Here are ways that the 104th Congress can help to restore family-friendly public policy</i>.
<p>
<a name="life"><center><h3>Restoring the Sanctity of Human Life</h3></center>
<p>
<b>1. The Civil Right to Life.</b> Four members of the House, two Democrats and two Republicans, have introduced constitutional amendments to restore the right to life of children before birth.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has introduced S. 320, the "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act."  It would put Congress on record as declaring, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion and that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was improperly decided.  It would also bar any federal funding or promotion of abortion, and provide for an expedited right of appeal to the Supreme Court when any abortion restriction is found unconstitutional by a lower court.  These proposals do not merely "modify" the abortion right, they would give protection to unborn children for the first time in 22 years.
<p>
<b>2. Members Against Dismemberment</b>. As a first step toward providing constitutional protection for unborn children, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will offer legislation to ban "partial birth abortions," which involve the heinous D&X procedure performed on unborn children 20-26 weeks of gestation.  Hearings are scheduled this month in the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution.
<p>
<b>3. "Lady Liberty" Means No to Forced Abortions.</b> The Clinton administration has shown blatant disregard for fundamental human rights by overturning previous administrations' asylum policy for families fleeing China's coercive "birth quota" system, with its forced abortions and sterilizations.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) recently attached language to the foreign aid bill (H.R. 1561) to restore the previous policy.  By record vote of  240-181 on the same bill, the House voted to deny U.S. foreign assistance dollars to non-governmental groups that perform or provide abortions, or that lobby other nations to repeal their laws restricting abortion.  The same measure would also require the United Nations Population Fund to end its involvement in China's draconian family planning program -- or lose all U.S. funds.  H.R. 1561 should pass the House as is, and the Senate should agree.
<p>
<b>4. Adopt Adoption Assistance.</b> In an effort to encourage adoption by lowering financial obstacles, the House of Representatives has passed a budget provision which allows taxpayers a $5,000 credit for qualified adoption expenses.  The Senate did not include the adoption assistance measure in their budget measure, passed on May 25.  An amendment offered by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) that included the credit was defeated on May 23 by vote of 69-31.  The differing budgets now go to a House-Senate conference, and FRC will be working to ensure that the adoption credit survives in the final bill.  Adoption is the <i>option of choice</i> for dealing with crisis pregnancy.
<p>
<b>5. No Abortion Mandate</b>. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) will introduce legislation to prohibit the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from requiring hospital ob/gyn residency programs (including religious hospitals) to train or refer medical students to perform abortions, lest they lose accreditation.  At stake are federal  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.  Subcommittee chairman Hoekstra also scheduled a June 14  hearing in the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to examine ACGME's coercive policy.
<p>
<a name="education"><center><h3>Empower Parents for Education</h3></center>
<p>
<b>6. Be True to Our Schools.</b> At last, serious efforts are under way to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.  The House budget resolution withdraws funding for the department.  In addition, the House Education Task Force's "Back to the Basics Education Bill" returns authority to the state and local level.  This is a high-priority issue for FRC; action could come in Congress within several months.  The decline in American education parallels the rise of the Department of Education; it's time to test the linkage in reverse.
<p>
<b>7. Be True II.</b> The House has taken one small swipe at Goals 2000, the omnibus education legislation that transferred unprecedented education authority from localities to Washington, D.C.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 1045, which would eliminate NESIC, the equivalent of a national school board set up by the law.  Congress should now repeal <i>all</i> of the intrusive programs instituted by Goals 2000.  Kudos to Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has raised the issue in the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and to Gov. George Allen of Virginia, who has refused to accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  We have to free our children from the control of the national education bureaucrats and their allies at the National Education Association.
<p>
<a name="purse"><center><h3>Protect the Family Purse</h3></center>
<p>
<b>8. Pro-child Tax Credits.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit helps relieve the tax burden on American families.  The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes the $500-per-child credit and has also included it in its budget resolution.  Unfortunately, the credit's fate in the Senate is uncertain:  key Republican senators are raising doubts about the bill, and the Senate budget resolution passed on May 25 omitted it.  The Senate should change course and act to protect the family budget as it works to fix the federal budget.
<p>
<b>9. Don't Forget Health Reform.</b> Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) has drafted legislation, not yet introduced, to change the income tax code to permit individual Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  These MSAs would give individuals and families greater control over their health care decisions, resulting in your family having coverage even if you change jobs, decreased costs, and broadened access to health care services.  FRC has joined a coalition of pro-family groups to promote such legislation.  The effort in 1994 to turn over health care to the government -- socialized medicine -- was defeated.  Sound reform is more critical now than ever.
<p>
<a name="wilderness"><center><h3>Tame the Cultural Wilderness</h3></center>
<p>
<b>10. Ban Homosexuality in Uniform.</b> Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved when Congress passed a reform bill in 1993.  Wrong.  The Clinton administration ignored the text of the law when it wrote the implementing regulations, effectively lifting the ban anyway.  Now the administration is using the federal courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a losing case in the Supreme Court.  New legislation is imperative.  None is pending, but FRC's Military Readiness Project, with senior advisers former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow, is seeking Congressional support for appropriate amendments to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.
<p>
<b>11. Porn-Free Cable TV.</b> With the encouragement of FRC, Reps. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) have introduced legislation that would require cable TV operators to provide basic cable packages free of pornography.  Meanwhile, pro-family groups are working on alternatives to Sen. Jim Exon's (D-Neb.) Communications Decency Act of 1995, S. 314.   Exon's bill is a well-intentioned attempt to restrict transmission of pornography via computer, but may actually make it more difficult to prosecute.
<p>
<b>12. Porn-Free PXs</b>. Under current policy, military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether or not it fits the definition of "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of <i>Miller v. California</i>.  The services oppose removing so-called "soft-core" pornography from exchange shelves because of the threat of legal action from the ACLU.  President Clinton has the unilateral authority to remove pornographic material from military stores.  He should do so, and Congress should adopt a resolution urging that action upon him.
<p>

True Welfare Reform.</b> The full Senate should vote on a measure to restore the anti-illegitimacy provisions that were adopted by the House but then eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee on May 25.  The critical provisions are:  a restriction on federally funded cash benefits for adolescent unwed mothers; a "cap" on benefits  to mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and bonus payments to states that succeed in reducing their illegitimacy rates without increasing the number of abortions.
<p>
<b>14. X Out Title X.</b> Title X of the Public Health Service Act -- a program which funds family planning projects throughout the country -- has been a dismal failure, especially among teenagers.  Since it began in 1970, out-of-wedlock births, pregnancies, and abortions among teenagers have all risen sharply.  Sexually transmitted diseases have multiplied in variety and are on the rebound as well.  Last year, Title X received $194 million in your tax money.  This summer, FRC will work to change that figure to zero.  Planned Parenthood will be poorer, but adolescent well-being should flourish.
<p>
<b>15. Cures, Not Activism.</b> Federal taxpayers spend billions on AIDS through the Ryan White Care Act. Unfortunately, much money now goes to groups promoting homosexuality to school-children through "AIDS education." The Act is the single largest source of funds for homosexual activism. A Washington, D.C., recipient, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, endorses "safe" bathhouse sex (with condoms) and holds gay political seminars. Basic reform is needed.
<p>
<a name="ideas"><center><h3>Other Family-Friendly Ideas</h3></center>
<p>
<b>16. Women at Arms.</b> The Clinton administration has conducted an aggressive campaign to thrust women into military combat.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness.  Congress should convene hearings and prepare legislation that puts readiness first.  If they don't, someday soon your daughter could be drafted.
<p>
<b>17. Off the Dole.</b> The Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), sponsored by Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.), would limit federally funded persons or organizations, such as contractors and advocacy groups, from lobbying Congress for more funding.  It would also prohibit lobbyists from receiving federal funds.  The legislation would not apply to recipients of entitlements and would not restrict the ability of individual citizens to communicate with their elected representatives.
<p>
<b>18. Revitalize Drug Abuse Prevention.</b> Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to a resurgence of pro-drug sentiment in popular culture, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The administration's drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" -- treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress is considering cuts in drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership.  New legislation is needed to address this plague. 
<p>
<b>19. Liberate the Arts.</b> The House passed a budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) on May 18, providing no funds for the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The resolution also ends funding for public television after three years.  A separate bill (H.R. 1557), passed by a House committee on May 10, would phase out the endowments by 1999.  Meanwhile, several senators have introduced S. 856, a bill that would keep the NEA alive.  FRC and other pro-family forces favor total defunding.  Artists need their freedom -- and so do taxpayers.
<p>
<b>20. Restore Religious Rights.</b> Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a congressional coalition in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  The language of the amendment is not yet final, but it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other forms of religious expression wherever non-religious expression is permitted.  The amendment is also likely to ban discrimination against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.  No more second-class status for this First Amendment freedom.
<p>
<b>21. Restore Parental Rights.</b> Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) are working on legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Such a law would, for instance, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.  State constitutional amendments to protect parental rights have also been introduced in over half of the states.  Public policy cannot put families first if it does not empower parents.
<p>
<b>22. Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism.</b> Pro-family groups are calling for defunding of the Legal Services Corporation.  The $415 million per year program purports to provide legal services to the poor but often engages in politically motivated legal assaults on the family.  Since 1974, taxpayers have given LSC $5 billion, some of it used for things like obtaining cable TV for prisoners, fighting welfare reform, seeking public abortion funding, and forcing states to fund sex-change operations.

<a name="meaning"><center><h3>The Meaning of Family</h3></center>
<p>
On the grounds of the U.S. Capitol there is a small cluster of crab apple trees, one of the most moving monuments in all of Washington.  The cluster was planted on June 12, 1952 in memory of the Sullivan brothers, five sons of Iowa who died in 1942 during an attack upon the <i>U.S.S. Juneau</i> in the Solomon Islands.
<p>
After this devastating tragedy, the U.S. Navy changed its policy allowing service by family members on the same vessel.  Never again would a single American family lay, simultaneously, so "costly a sacrifice on the altar of freedom." (A. Lincoln)
<p>
In 1942 the contributions of American families -- the meaning of <i>family</i> -- to our nation's well-being and survival were never in question.  Today, as the accompanying <i>Blueprint</i> shows, our nation is at grave risk of forgetting all that the courage and faithfulness of families have given this land.
<p>
As Americans commemorate the family during this month of June -- from  
celebrations honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, to Father's Day -- Congress could give the nation no greater gift than to make pro-family legislation a priority.
<p>
FRC's writers and analysts are working overtime to bring the best family policy analysis to print.  Our recently expanded Government Relations staff is responding to an over-rising tide of requests for information.  Your partnership with us in this effort is essential.

<center><h1>SHREDDED BLISS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage 
is &quot;the foundation of the family and of society, without which there 
would be neither civilization nor progress.&quot;

<p>

Because of its crucial role, marriage has a special status within
the culture and the law.  Its essence -- the joining of one man
and one woman in an exclusive legal, sexual, economic and spiritual
bond with the procreation of children as a desirable and common
result -- had not been seriously challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

<center><h3>Hawaiian Havoc</h3></center>

<p>

Now, a tiny segment of a tiny fraction of the population -- the
homosexual activist community -- is on the verge of radically
redefining marriage and family.  If they succeed, all distinctions
based on sex may fall, and the worst aspects of the rejected Equal
Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals will gain the &quot;right&quot;
to adopt children; schoolchildren will be taught that homosexual
sex is the equivalent of marital love between husband and wife;
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships;
churches will be pushed outside the civil law; and government
power will be wielded against anyone who holds the biblical view
of homosexuality.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  The
case, <i>Baehr v. Lewin,</i> was brought by three same-sex couples
who charged the state with &quot;discrimination&quot; for not
granting them marriage licenses.  Despite widespread opposition
within Hawaii (recent polls show that 71% of Hawaiians oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;), homosexual activists hope to impose
their agenda through compliant courts.

<p>

Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause calls
for states to honor each other's laws, homosexuals are planning
to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to the mainland
to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  About 25 states now have
efforts underway to protect marriage, and three of them -- Hawaii,
Utah and South Dakota -- have enacted new laws protecting marriage.

<p>

In Washington, a bill is being drafted to bind the federal government
to a &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition of marriage.  Tentatively
titled the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the bill would protect
the military, Social Security,  and all federal agencies from
radical redefinition of wedlock.

<p>

<center><h3>Full Court Press</h3></center>

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several other key cases
involving homosexuality are being decided in the nation's courts.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a key Colorado
case in which voters had passed a constitutional amendment to
bar any city or county from enacting special rights based on sexual
orientation.  About a dozen cases challenging the military's ban
on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.

<p>

In Georgia, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian
fired from her job at the state attorney general's office after
she announced that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  Bear
in mind that the attorney general is required to defend Georgia's
sodomy law.  In  New York, the state's high court opened adoption
proceedings to homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexual couples,
thus devaluing marriage and jeopardizing children.

<center><i><font size=+2>
TWENTY-FIVE STATES MOVE TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The pattern is clear:  homosexual activists are using the courts
to get what they cannot achieve through democracy.  But the courts
do not operate in a vacuum.  U.S. Supreme Court justices noted
that one factor that affected the <i>Casey</i> decision upholding
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was the court's public image.  Amherst legal
scholar Hadley Arkes notes that if Americans boldly defend marriage,
the courts may hesitate to radically redefine it.  If the states
pass marriage protection bills, and Congress enacts DOMA, the
judicial assault on traditional morality could falter.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call your Congressman and Senators and ask that they cosponsor
the coming Defense of Marriage Act.  The Capitol Hill switchboard
is 202-225-3121.

<p>

Call state legislators and ask them to support your state's marriage
protection bill, or if there isn't yet such a bill, ask them to
sponsor one.

<p>

Educate yourself about the threat to marriage today -- from mistaken
public policies and cultural decay.  Consult the enclosed reply
card for information on new resources that defend this embattled,
but essential institution.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Border Order.</b>  H.R. 2202 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),
and two competing Senate bills, Alan Simpson's (R-Wyo.) S. 1394
and Spencer Abraham's (R-Mich.) S. 1535, each seek to reform immigration
policy.  FRC deplores nativist rhetoric and supports provisions
which reflect the following principles:  (1) Illegal immigration
must be halted; America should not reward those whose first act
in this country is to break the law, and (2) America must remain
a country that welcomes legal immigrants, with appropriate safeguards
for our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Red Letter.</b> President Clinton went on record in a Feb.
28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
saying he will veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it
reaches his desk.  Mr. Clinton claims the legislation is unacceptable
because it does not protect a woman's life or &quot;health.&quot;
FRC responded by saying, &quot;That President Clinton would veto
a ban on a procedure characterized as four-fifths infanticide
and one-fifth abortion shows his clear disregard for the value
of human life.&quot;

<p><a name="gamble">

<b>Gambling Gambit.</b> On March 5, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to establish the National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission.  The nine-member commission would conduct a
two-year study and report its findings to states, Congress and
the president. &quot;[T]his legislation creates no new regulations
and imposes no new mandates on gambling or state and local governments,&quot;
said its sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.).  The sole purpose,
he added, is to help communities make informed decisions on gambling
questions.  Senate consideration is next.

<p>

<b>Healthy Debate.</b> On April 18-19 the Senate will debate
a health insurance reform bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.).  The bill, which President Clinton
supports, does <I>not</I> contain medical savings accounts (MSA's),
and would give Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
the power to ensure that state health insurance plans conform
with the &quot;goals&quot; of the bill, including &quot;comprehensive
coverage.&quot;  A related House bill, sponsored by Rep. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), is expected to contain MSA's, no new taxes,
and no defined comprehensive benefits package.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Teens and AIDS.</b> A new study released by the White House
advocates more efforts to reduce the spread of AIDS among teenagers.
Twenty-five percent of Americans infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education and HIV testing without parental notice.  Meanwhile,
a House-Senate conference committee on the Ryan White Care Act
reauthorization is deadlocked over an amendment by Reps. Tom Coburn,
M.D. (R-Okla.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to require AIDS testing
of newborns.  The Clinton administration opposes the requirement.
FRC supports it.

<p><a name="prayer">

<b>Wing and a Prayer.</b> The Department of Transportation is
at odds with a DOT employees' group over whether a prayer and
fellowship group can label homosexual behavior a sin.  The 50-member
Christian organization has waited more than 14 months for official
status because it rejects a &quot;nondiscrimination&quot; clause
that includes sexual orientation.  Group leaders say they welcome
homosexuals, but cannot agree to give them leadership positions
or sanction actions they consider sinful.  Meanwhile, DOT has
already given preferential treatment to GLOBE, the Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual Employees group.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Court-Assisted Suicide.</b> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled March 7 that Washington state's ban on assisted
suicide is unconstitutional.  The next day, a Michigan jury acquitted
Dr. Jack Kevorkian on charges of assisting in the suicide of two
individuals, the second time he has been exonerated.  Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, writing for the Ninth Circuit's 8-3 majority, directly
linked the ruling with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the 1973 case that
established abortion on demand.  Decision by Washington state
officials on an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.

<p>

<b>Damsels in Distress.</b> A new Population Reference Bureau
study confirms what Massachusetts and California have already
found:  about two-thirds of births to teenage girls are fathered
by men age 20 or older.  In addition, a 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute
report found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were
coerced by males an average of six years their senior.  As more
girls grow up without fathers to protect their honor, their search
for a father figure leaves them more vulnerable to predatory males.

<p>

<b>Grave But Stable?</b> Another Population Reference Bureau
report reveals both positive and negative trends among U.S. families.
Good news is that the divorce rate has leveled off, the growth
rate of single-parent families has been halved, and more two-parent
families with children have formed. However, the report also shows
that the U.S. still has the world's highest divorce rate and that
single-parent families are increasing three percent annually.
Census reports such as these sometimes reflect only a change in
demographics, not a genuine attitudinal shift.

<h3>FRC Soldiers On</h3>

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) was present on March 4
in Seattle, Washington when the ACLU and the Clinton Justice Department
once again misrepresented the military's homosexual law.  In the
case of <i>Philips v. Perry</i> which involves a homosexual sailor
who admitted to misconduct, Justice's attorney told a three-judge
appeals court panel that what the military has is a &quot;homosexual
accommodation law.&quot;  In fact, it has always had an exclusion
policy.

<p>

The government cited as evidence the fiction that some homosexual
service members have successfully convinced administrative boards
that being homosexual does not mean that they will engage in
illicit conduct.  At the hearing the ACLU asserted that homosexuals
can legally serve, and then argued that the <i>Philips</i> case
was really about discrimination.  Unbelievably, it took a judge
(a Bush-appointee) to highlight the fact that Philips had admitted
to homosexual sex with &quot;a dozen&quot; men.

<p>

The MRP has participated in five federal appeals court cases.
Most recently, on March 15, it joined the <i>Richtenberg v. Perry</i>
case which involves an Air Force captain who declared himself
a homosexual.  Like the others, he seeks to invalidate the law
and the Pentagon's regulations.  This case may present another
opportunity for the MRP to make oral arguments, as it did last
December in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. The MRP will defend the
underlying law, and the Clinton Justice Department will defend
the faulty &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.

<p>

Two cases soon to be decided, <i>Abel v. U.S.A.</i> and <i>Thomasson</i>,
are competing for the attention of the Supreme Court.  Decisions
in both cases are expected this spring, and one of them will be
appealed to the high court this summer with oral arguments likely
during the court's next term.

<p>

Meanwhile, a new administration could discard Clinton's faulty
&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; regulations and require the
Justice Department to defend the law before the Supreme Court.
In any event, major news on this issue is only months away.

<h3>Rx for the Drug War</h3>

<p>

On Feb. 15, FRC hosted a national drug abuse prevention strategy
meeting.  Nationally known experts from diverse backgrounds and
regions came together to develop an eight-part action plan.  The
participants agreed:  the drug scourge is getting worse, and something
must be done to reignite grass-roots anti-drug efforts.

<p>

The strategy has a two-part prevention focus:  use of mind/mood-altering
drugs is dangerous to the individual and society, and comprehensive
community-based prevention is the most viable solution to the
drug crisis.

<p>

Drug education must begin at home.  The strategy calls for drug
education resources to be tied to accountability.  Drug abuse
messages must be congruent and consistently broadcast through
every educational setting (homes, schools, workplaces, communities
and media).

<p>

Law enforcement must identify all users and impose consequences
on abuse.  It must also create systematic accountability for funding
and success rates.  Key to the strategy is leadership.  Leaders
at all levels must speak clearly and serve as role models.

<p>

Grass-roots citizen action is vital.  Accountability for drug
abuse prevention must be locally based, and citizen groups must
have power over funds to make their programs work.  The media
must stop glamorizing drugs and provide truthful alternative messages.
The strategy calls for an annual report on media handling of
the drug prevention message.

<p>

Treatment for abusers should be delivered at the point of need
with accountability.  This includes providing appropriate long-term
treatment.  Finally, the strategy calls for reallocating available
drug funds with strict standards.  This year the federal government
will spread $13 billion across 140 programs with little accountability.

<p>

FRC wants the strategy to influence each political party's presidential
platform and all future drug-related legislation.   It provides
a federal model for the drug war that focuses the government on
supply interdiction and passes responsibility and fiscal authority
for prevention and treatment to local communities.

<p>

FRC's short-term goal is to have drug abuse recognized as a national
crisis. America must aim to cut current abuse levels at least
in half by the year 2000.  The long-term goal is the eradication
of drug abuse.

of strengthening families worldwide.

<p>

Several years ago, radical homosexual members of the ACT-UP group
invaded St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and desecrated
the Host.  Millions of Christians around the world believe that
Christ is really present in the sacrament of communion.  America
has had, tragically, anti-Catholic riots in its history.  &quot;Know
Nothing&quot; mobs even dumped one of the stones intended for
the Washington Monument into the Potomac because it had been generously
donated by the pope.  But Act-Up's church invasion set a new low
for efforts to offend the deeply held religious beliefs of a whole
community.

<p>

In suburban Washington, D.C., the Montrose Baptist Church has
twice been the site of suspicious fires.  No one has been charged
with arson, but church members have cited the congregation's strong
pro-life stance and its high profile during the 1992 Maryland
abortion referendum as making it a likely target in liberal Montgomery
County.

<p>

Now we have even more disturbing evidence of hatred in action.
At least 25 black churches have been hit in a new wave of arson
in California and a number of southern states. This form of bigotry
cannot be tolerated. That is why I have joined with a group of
black, Jewish, Catholic and evangelical Christian leaders to call
for prompt hearings by the Judiciary Committees of the House and
Senate.

<p>

The current wave of church bombings began on April 4, 1993.  That
was the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.  The pace of these attacks has picked up since January,
1995.  There is evidence of a pattern here, a pattern that suggests
a conspiracy to violate our civil rights laws. There is every
reason for the federal government to act.

<p>

It does not matter what motivates the haters.  Whether it is a
<i>Hamas</i> suicide bomber who catches Bus No. 18 in Jerusalem,
or a racist who wants to terrorize black Christians peacefully
worshipping here at home, terrorism is evil and we must mobilize
against it.

<i><font size=+2>WE MUST MOBILIZE AGAINST<br>
TERRORISM.</font></i>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

This is also a good time to reassert the real meaning of the First
Amendment. The right of the people to the &quot;free exercise&quot;
of religion is a precious one, bought with the blood of patriots
and martyrs.  Millions of our American ancestors came to this
country seeking this right above all others.

<p>

It does not help the cause of religious tolerance when the federal
government itself treats religion as a suspect classification.
Christian employees of the Federal Aviation Administration are
still finding their request to start a prayer group stiff-armed
by bureaucrats who welcome gay activist groups (see 
<a href="#news"><I>Newswatch</I></a>).

<p>

Moreover, the Clinton administration has recently moved to squelch
tuition assistance which has been provided since 1929 for Americans
serving in Ecuador.  The parents who chose the Alliance Academy,
a Christian school, were evidently pleased with the quality of
education provided and the spiritual and moral guidance their
children received there.  But now, with the opening of a completely
secular private school in Ecuador's capital, Quito, parents have
been told to enroll their kids in this private school or forego
the assistance the U.S. government has long provided.

<p>

Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism and racism have no place in our
sweet land of liberty. Nor does the disdainful view of too many
that religion itself is to be discouraged. As Irving Kristol has
wisely noted:  &quot;The real danger is not from a revived Christianity...but
from an upsurge of antibiblical barbarism that will challenge
Christianity, Judaism and Western Civilization together.&quot;
To which, I say: &quot;Amen!&quot;

In 1994, Miss Hansen joined the Family Research Council's Media
Department to facilitate the networking of information between
television, print, and radio contacts and FRC's Policy Experts.
Hansen's communication skills are a factor in FRC's rapidly growing
media presence in Washington, D.C. and nation-wide. 

<p>

Her responsibilities at FRC include handling all broadcast media
requests in the area of news and talk radio as well as planning
outgoing radio tours of FRC policy experts. In addition, Hansen
associates with television and print contacts along with the Director
of Communications in order to clearly present FRC's pro-family
message far and wide. As an effective spokesperson on politics,
policy, and the media, Hansen helps FRC in generating up to a
thousand clips a month and daily broadcast interviews.  

<p>

Hansen also works extensively on the media strategy for FRC's
special projects, such as the &quot;Save Sex&quot; campaign, 
<I>Let Freedom Ring: A Basic Outline of American History</I>, <I>The
Children of Table 34</I> video, and <I>A Family Fourth: Independence
Day and Other Celebrations</I>.

<p>

Hansen's experience includes work in a sports marketing firm
and in the development of athletic ministries. Native of Southern
California, Hansen graduated from Princeton University in 1994
receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

<center><h1>SPECIAL REPORT</h1>
<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="un"><h2><i>UN:  Bound for Beijing</i></h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>rom Sept. 4-15, 1995, the United Nations (UN) will hold
its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.  The United
States will be sending a delegation to the conference -- despite
the objections of pro-familiy advocates.  First Lady Hillary Clinton
was originally slated to attend, but at latest word will not,
due to China's imprisonment of American human rights activist
Harry Wu.
<p>
<center><h3>Bracketing the Family</h3></center>
<p>
This conference purports to advance women's rights.  However,
many pro-family groups, including FRC, oppose the Beijing conference
agenda for the very reason that it denigrates women and families,
reflecting a radical feminist agenda.  For, not only is the conference
being hosted by a country with a long track record of abusing
women (e.g., female infanticide, coercive abortion policies),
but the platform document:
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"<font size=+3>M</font>OTHER" IS BRACKETED<br>
FOR REPLACEMENT.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<b>Denigrates motherhood and traditional family life.</b> For example,
the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout the
entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed for
change to &quot;household.&quot;  Bracketed sections indicate
that delegates could not agree in advance on the text.  These
sections are to be debated in Beijing.  In addition, the word
&quot;family&quot; almost always appears in a negative context,
i.e., in relation to domestic violence or female oppression.
<p>
<b>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power play.</b>
  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform:  &quot;Inequality in
the public arena can often start within the family when power
relations between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal
power relations also limits women's potential...&quot;  Thus,
rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are never used.
<p>
<b>Leaves the term &quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</b>
 &quot;Gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform
document.  But when asked to define the term, the UN rejected
the suggestion that there are two genders: &quot;male&quot; and
&quot;female.&quot;  The UN also rejected the definition of &quot;gender&quot;
as &quot;the socially-constructed roles which society assigns
to men and women.&quot;  In feminist literature, this definition
means that gender is subject to change and there exists a spectrum
of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual, female
heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual).  Instead,
the UN decided that &quot;gender&quot; was to be understood &quot;in
its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  The definition battle will
be a major focus in Beijing.
<p>
<b>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</b>
 The platform repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling[.]&quot;
 While occasionally mentioning the legal responsibility of parents
for their children, the platform refuses to recognize parental
authority regarding their children's reproductive health.
<p>
<b>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</b>
  In the tradition of previous UN conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen,
the Beijing platform urges governments to &quot;take action to
ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized
and respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  In fact, the platform elevates
reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating
that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Contact your representative and senators, either in Washington
or at their in-state office.  Tell them to speak out against the
Beijing conference, publicizing its violations of women's fundamental
dignity.

<h3>On The Hill</h3>
<p><a name="issues">
<b>The House Holds.</b> Before adjourning for its August vacation, the
House of Representatives passed two amendments to curb U.S. promotion
of abortion overseas.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) led the fight
to prevent U.S. funding of groups that seek to overturn the anti-abortion
laws of sovereign nations.  The Smith amendments would also deny
U.S. aid to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) if it continues to
participate in China's coercive population control program.  Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) intends to offer the same amendment to S.
908, the State Department authorization bill.
<p>
<b>Pro-Family Sendoff.</b> U.S. delegates to the Beijing Women's Conference
received pro-family instructions from the Senate on August 1.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) offered an amendment which
called on the U.S. delegation to promote a representative perspective
on the value of motherhood and the traditional family.  The amendment
also urged the delegates to define &quot;gender&quot; classically,
as in &quot;male and female, the two sexes of the human being.&quot;
 Pro-family delegates and observers participating in pre-conference
negotiations at the UN headquarters in New York were energized
by passage of the resolution.
<p>
<b>Pop Aid Bust.</b> The foreign aid bill passed by the House in July
will make it more difficult for the Clinton Administration to
carry out its population control agenda.  The &quot;development
assistance&quot; account, which has traditionally provided hundreds
of millions of dollars each year for international population
projects, was substantially reduced and a separate account was
dedicated to child survival and disease prevention efforts.  Pro-family
forces will now try to persuade the Senate to go along with the
reduced anti-population money.
<p><a name="alphabet">
<center><h3>The United Nations at Half-Century: A Primer</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he messages of congratulation poured in from all over the
world.   President Truman thanked Almighty God for bringing the
world community so far in its search for peace.  South African
Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called its Charter &quot;not
a perfect document, by any means . . . But at least it is a good,
practical, workmanlike plan for peace.&quot;  As he presided over
the final vote to create the United Nations, taken on June 25,
1945, Britain's Lord Halifax expressed the hope that the delegates
had taken part &quot;in one of the great moments of history.&quot;
<p>
To carry out its charter, the United Nations has, over time,
created an alphabet soup of commissions and agencies.  Some of
these entities have social and economic missions; others have
military missions.  Recently, peacekeeping activities by UN agencies
in such trouble spots as Somalia (UNISOM), Haiti (UNMIH) and the
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) have raised serious questions about
the world body's effectiveness and its proper role.  
<p>
The UN has grown with the decolonization of major European
powers and the breakup of the Soviet empire. The major bodies
of the UN have different functions. The UN's annual budget is
$4 billion. The U.S. contribution, according to our Mission to
the UN, is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.  UN documents
are printed  in the five official languages: English, French,
Spanish, Chinese and Russian.   Unless otherwise indicated, the
UN body described below is headquartered in New York.
<p>
<b>The General Assembly.</b>  The largest UN body, the General Assembly
is comprised of 185 member states.  Each member has one vote in
the General Assembly.  The General Assembly has authorized many
of the key UN agencies which have a direct impact on families.
 These include the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
<p>
<b>The Secretariat.</b> This body is headed by the Secretary-General,
who reports to the General Assembly.  He supervises executive
functions of the UN.  The Secretary-General has traditionally
been selected from the ranks of the &quot;non-aligned&quot; nations.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) currently serves in the post.
<p>
<b>The Security Council.</b>  The Security Council consists of 15
members.  Five of these -- Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and
France -- have veto powers over council actions.  The Council
is charged with responding to threats to peace.
<p>
<b>The Economic and Social Council.</b>  The 54 members of this
body are elected to terms by the General Assembly.  It is responsible
for UN efforts in the economic and social areas.  It includes
many specialized agencies.  Among them are the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, Rome), the World Health Organization (WHO,
Geneva), the International Labor Organization (ILO, Geneva), the
very influential International Monetary Fund (IMF, Washington),
the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,
Paris). 
<p>
<b>The International Court of Justice (World Court, The Hague,
Netherlands).</b> The 15 judges are elected to nine-year terms by
the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Questions are
decided by majority vote.  All members of the UN are members of
the World Court, as are non-members Switzerland, San Marino and
Liechtenstein.

<center><h2><font size=+3>P</font>OLICY <font size=+3>U</font>PDATE</h2></center>
<p><a name="convention">
<font size=+3><i>The</i></font> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC) was approved by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 20, 1989.
 It was in force on Sept. 2, 1990 after the 20th nation ratified
it.
<p>
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, signed the treaty on Feb. 16, 1995.  President Clinton
has said that the U.S. will spell out its interpretation of the
Convention with a statement of  &quot;reservations and understandings&quot;
that will go to the Senate.
<p>
A treaty becomes law in this country if the U.S. Senate ratifies
it by a two-thirds vote (67 Senators, if all are present).  This
has not yet happened and seems unlikely because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
<p>
In fact, on June 14, Helms introduced S. R. 133.  This resolution
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators are cosponsors.
<p>
As an international treaty, the UNCRC would be co-equal with
federal statutes, and possibly the United States Constitution.
 If the United States were to ratify the treaty as it stands,
it would become not only an international obligation, but also
a domestic obligation potentially regulating the most intimate
details of American family life. 
<p>
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
 Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
 Conceivably, taking a child to church, when he would rather not
go, could be a violation of the child's right to freedom of religion
(Article 14); telling a child to turn off the television could
violate the child's right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information&quot;
(Article 13), and so forth. 
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is a risk America's
families do not need -- and cannot afford -- to take.
<p><hr><p>
<a name="march"><center><h3>The UN and the Family: Major Documents</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he United Nations was founded in the shadow of the Second
World War, a renewed attempt by the victorious democracies to
establish an international body to safeguard the peace and promote
human rights.  From the beginning, with the drafting of the UN
Charter and related documents such as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the UN has attempted to give voice to the common
aspirations of the world's people.  Only within the past two decades
has the UN expanded its agenda in ways that pose direct threats
to the traditional family.
<p>
Here are some major landmarks in the history of UN advocacy
regarding marriage and the family:
<p>
<b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</b> Article 16 asserts
the right &quot;to marry and to found a family,&quot; provides
that marriage must be entered into &quot;freely&quot; by the spouses,
and defines the family &quot;as the natural and fundamental group
unit of society . . . entitled to protection by society and the
state.&quot;  The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly
in 1948.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</b>
 The Covenant, which is in treaty form, promotes special measures
to protect the family, mothers, and children.  Article 10 repeats
the definition of family in the <b>Universal Declaration</b> and calls
for &quot;the widest possible protection and assistance&quot;
to the family. Addresses such issues as family leave and child
labor.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> Article
23 of the Covenant uses the same definition of family as the <b>Universal
Declaration</b>, and requires nations that have ratified the Covenant
&quot;to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses
as to marriage[.]&quot;
<p>
<b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.</b> Article 12 introduces language requiring nations
to ensure access to health care, including family planning.  Like
the <b>Universal Declaration</b>, it speaks clearly of &quot;men&quot;
and &quot;women&quot; in these contexts.  Article 16 enumerates
eight specific rights as regards marriage, with emphasis on equality
of rights regarding children and property and the &quot;right
to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children[.]&quot; The United States has not ratified this
Convention.
<p>
<b>International Year of the Family (IYF).</b> First proposed in
1987, the year was actually celebrated in 1994.  In the best modern
UN mode, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali announced that &quot;[t]here
is no single definition of a family.  There is no one model.&quot;
 An IYF document, &quot;The Changing Family Structure,&quot; lumped
together everything from &quot;polygamous&quot; and &quot;community&quot;
families to &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;adoptive&quot; families.
 &quot;Same-sex&quot; families also get equal footing in the document.
<p><hr width=65%><p>
<h3><center>NGO: FRC and the UN</center></h3>
<p>
&quot;NGO&quot; is one of the most commonly heard terms in
UN-speak.  It stands for &quot;Non-Governmental Organization,&quot;
and refers to private associations specifically recognized and
consulted by the United Nations.  Examples include the International
Red Cross, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Planned Parenthood.
 NGOs are first mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945 as important
resources for the General Assembly and the various commissions
it creates to address specific issues.
<p>
NGOs may be international or merely national in scope.  Their
number is large (some 1,500) and growing.  The presence of UN
Headquarters in New York City has given New York-based NGOs a
considerable advantage in lobbying the UN on a daily basis.  Some
NGOs, like WEDO, led by former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and a
major participant in UN conferences on population and the environment,
are almost fully funded by foundation money.  Others are grassroots-oriented.
<p>
NGO status can be permanent or temporary, allowing a group
access to the UN generally or merely to specific conferences.
 The Family Research Council was granted NGO status for the world
population conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994.  FRC has
also obtained NGO status for Beijing (<i>see earlier article</i>).  This status
does not allow FRC to vote on the Beijing Plan, but it <i>will</i> make
us more effective eyes and ears for the American family.

<center><b><font size=+2><i>What So Proudly We Hail?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
Americans have historically sacrificed for peace. We went
to war twice in this century for the peace and freedom of Europe.
 Americans fought and died defending the independence of Korea,
Vietnam, Grenada, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Most recently, Americans
have shouldered the burden of famine relief in strife-torn Somalia.
The American people and their government respond generously to
natural disasters. 
<p>
America has taken a leading role in supporting the United
Nations, too.  From 1945 on, the U.S. provided the greater part
of UN funding and support.  President Kennedy defended the world
organization when the Soviets tried to hamstring it with a three-man
troika in place of its single Secretary-General.  That formula
would have guaranteed paralysis -- which is what the Soviets really
wanted.
<p>
Despite this record, the UN has often been a three-ring circus
of anti-Americanism.  The U.S. has regularly been denounced as
&quot;imperialist&quot; and a &quot;war monger&quot; during what
passed for UN debates.  Efforts to empower the nations of the
&quot;South&quot; by levying confiscatory assessments on the free
industrial democracies of the &quot;North&quot; have been popular
among all too many members of the General Assembly.  Third World
delegates have cheered the so-called New World Information Order,
which is nothing more than a dignified name for press muzzling
by tinpot despots. 
<p>
Still, Americans have remained largely willing to tolerate
the UN as an important forum for international discussion.  For
the sake of peace, we have gone the extra mile.  Recent stories
about UN diplomats who have run up thousands of parking violations
in New York City and who have stiffed the Big Apple's merchants
to the tune of millions have struck nerves, however.  No warm
and fuzzy talk of &quot;cultural disparities&quot; should cover
the obvious truth:  a ripoff is a ripoff.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+3>UN E</font><font size=+2>XPANSION</font> 
 <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+2>HREATENS</font><br>
<font size=+3>U.S. S</font><font size=+2>OVEREIGNTY</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
This corruption is far less troubling than the new trend
toward building an army of &quot;blue helmets&quot; to police
the world.  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has moved
aggressively since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assert
a new doctrine of sovereignty. <i>Sovereignty</i>. That's a key word
and concept.  Americans recognize it better by referring to our
founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  That document
set forth our right to stand &quot;among the powers of the earth&quot;
as a free and equal nation.
<p>
The Secretary General's expansive view of UN authority is
not just an opinion.  The UN fielded only two peacekeeping missions
in its first five years, but it has dispatched the blue helmet
19 times in the past four years.  Many have greater ambitions
still.  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a communist, is
pushing a worldwide environmental initiative which sees a major
role for the UN.  Former French President Francois Mitterand,
a socialist, advocates the creation of a &quot;UN Legion&quot;
to give military teeth to the UN's resolutions. 
<p>
Veteran liberal Ronnie Dugger would go even further.  He
writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that if the member states are unwilling
or unable to man a UN Legion, the UN should accept volunteers
from the recognized Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These
private groups are playing an increasing role in UN activities.
 The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>, the Greenpeace ship that has confronted
whalers and nuclear test personnel, might be the first of a whole
fleet under the Dugger plan.
<p>
All of these suggestions come at a time of growing UN military
focus.  The UN Department of Peacekeeping has expanded from a
staff of 23 to more than 350 today, with a modern &quot;situation
center,&quot; staffed 24 hours a day.  What are the limits to
this mushrooming role?
<p>
As we watch the UN's Beijing Conference on Women, we should
each ask ourselves:  what if an army had the power to enforce
the resolutions passed by these delegates?  Would Americans remain
free and independent? I once considered such questions idle speculation.
 Not anymore.

<title>Gary Bauer's June, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

June 7, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

June is fittingly called &quot;the month of weddings.&quot; 
As the first real warm days of summer finally arrive, skies are
blue, flowers are blooming, and brides and grooms are seemingly
everywhere.  Marriage is never out of season, but I can think
of no better time than the month of June for our nation to reaffirm
the value and meaning of marriage.

<p>

As this letter is written, a reaffirmation of marriage is taking
place all across our land.  You can hear it in the peal of church
bells and read about it in wedding announcements and church bulletins.
You can even see it in brightly decorated cars parading by on
dazzling June days.  But this reaffirmation is taking place in
another way, too.

<p>

In Washington, DC, and in over 30 states, legislators are stepping
forward to make sure that marriage is protected in American law.
My letter is brief this month because the Family Research Council
is in the thick of this essential effort.  The reaffirmation of
traditional marriage is coming <b>just in time</b>.  Even as I
write this, an organized assault is in progress to redefine marriage
to allow men to marry men and women to marry women.

<p>

Let me recap quickly what has happened.  In 1993, the highest
court in Hawaii handed down a shocking decision.  Liberal judges
there said that Hawaii's law limiting marriage to one man and
one woman (similar to laws in every other state) was a form of
sex discrimination -- unless the state could somehow show that it
had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in reserving marriage to
couples of the opposite sex!  Hawaii is a very liberal state politically,
but this ruling sparked immediate outrage even there.

<p>

Nearly three quarters of Hawaii's citizens told pollsters they
<I>reject</I> making Hawaii a haven for homosexual couples to
&quot;marry.&quot;  In 1994 the Hawaii legislature responded and
passed a law reaffirming that marriage is intended for &quot;man-woman
units&quot; -- not two men or two women.

<p>

Despite the findings of this poll, and subsequent efforts to
convince the courts that Hawaii does have a &quot;compelling interest&quot;
here, most experts believe that traditional marriage in Hawaii
will be struck down -- perhaps as soon as this August.  If that happens,
homosexual couples from every state in the Union are ready to
fly to Hawaii and find &quot;chapels&quot;or Justices of the Peace
to marry them.  They will then return to their home states and
demand recognition of these marriages from their state and local
governments, from their employers, from the courts, from their
churches (and from you)!

<p>

The worst news is that these demands have a good chance of succeeding.
Under what is known as the &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;
clause of the U.S. Constitution, each state is required to recognize
the &quot;Public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings&quot;
of every other state (Article IV, Section 1).   States that refuse
to recognize these Hawaiian &quot;marriage&quot; licenses as valid
are likely to find themselves being sued in court, with the outcome
uncertain.  Unbelievably, the action of a single court -- or even
a single judge -- in Hawaii could lead to a revolution that undoes
the sanctity of the marriage bond in every corner of the United
States.

<p>

<b>We must not -- and cannot -- allow this to happen!</b> When Hawaii's
Supreme Court ruled in 1993, FRC responded with alerts and issue
papers pointing out the devastating impact that would follow.
We and other groups encouraged states to respond by reaffirming
the traditional definition of marriage to insulate it from attack.
The word has spread rapidly, and a wide coalition of religious
and family groups and legislators of all political persuasions
is currently pushing for marriage protection laws.

<p>

Such laws have now been enacted in at least eleven states, and
more may be signed into law by the time you read this.  In addition,
the Congress of the United States is set to respond to this challenge.
With FRC's help and through the dedicated efforts of legal experts
on Capitol Hill, legislation has been introduced to protect marriage
in federal law.  This legislation is called the Defense of Marriage
Act, or DOMA.  It was introduced in the House of Representatives
on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob  Barr (R-Ga.).
Senate introduction of the legislation followed on May 8 with
Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Bob Dole (R-Kans.) as co-sponsors.
The respective bill numbers are H.R.3396 and S.1740.

<p>

Make no mistake, this bill is vitally needed.  Sen. Dan Coats
(R-Ind.) issued a powerful statement endorsing the bill and explaining
the importance of marriage.  His quote is worth sharing at length:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by 
humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual 
relationship that prepares the next generation for its duties and 
opportunities.  An 1884 decision of the Supreme Court called it 
&quot;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization.&quot;

<p>

The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, 
and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in our history,
in our laws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our 
nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and one woman. 
This fact can be respected or resented, but it can't be altered.

<p>

The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural inheritance. 
It is our duty -- perhaps our first duty -- to pass it intact to the 
future . . . It is amazing and disturbing that the debate should even 
be necessary.  It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep 
moral confusion.  But events have made the definition of traditional 
marriage essential.  The preservation of marriage has become an issue 
of self-preservation for our society.</i>

</blockquote><p>

With Senator Coats' words, the case for marriage rests.
Be assured that the Family Research Council will continue to
work with him and other like-minded legislators in both parties
to secure passage of this bill as soon as possible -- before a final
decision is reached by the Supreme Court in Hawaii.  Americans
need to be heard before our courts intervene and disturb yet another
legal ideal.  Our goal is that DOMA will swiftly reach President
Clinton's desk and that he will have no choice but to sign it
into law.

<p>

<b>The need for passage of this bill could not be more urgent.
On May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state of Colorado's
Amendment 2, which would have blocked special rights for homosexuals.
One leader of the homosexual movement bragged, &quot;This is
a joyous day for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.&quot;</b>

<p>

Please join with us in this effort.  Use the enclosed card, or
call us at 1-800-225-4008, to obtain a free copy of our information
packet on saving the institution of marriage.  Take note of the
enclosed copy of the full-page advertisement we placed in the
May 19 <i>Washington Post</i>.  Feel free to make copies or contact
us to arrange to run this ad in your local newspaper.

<p>

Be assured that your prayers and financial support of the work
of the Family Research Council are what sustain us.  Your involvment
and commitment to FRC will enable us to continue in our efforts
to defend the divine institution of marriage.  As always, thank
you for your friendship, and may God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<title>Gary Bauer's May, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

May 15, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

You probably read about the incredible speech Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia delivered at a prayer breakfast in early April at 
the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. Scalia delivered 
a stirring defense of the role of Christians in public life. The 
reaction was a prolonged standing ovation. But there was no ovation 
for the speech inside the Washington Beltway, where FRC fights 
every day on behalf of your family, or among America's cultural 
elite.

<p>

&quot;Justice Scalia: Defender of the Faith,&quot; sneered the
headline in the <I>International Herald Tribune.</I>[1]

<p>

The speech &quot;clearly undermines public confidence in [Scalia's]
objectivity regarding religious controversies,&quot;[2] said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

<p>

&quot;This is a disturbing view for a Justice to have,&quot;[3] said
Elliott Mincberg, legal director of Norman Lear's group, People for
the American Way.

<p>

The speech should have set off &quot;alarm bells,&quot;[4] charged
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover.

<p>

In a few pockets of liberalism outside the beltway the reaction
was even harsher:

<p>

Humor columnist Art Buchwald fired away: &quot;When a Justice
is hearing a case, no secular person can feel comfortable with
a member of the court who is thinking, 'If this lawyer doesn't
believe in the &quot;burning bush,&quot; he has a serious constitutional
problem.'&quot;[5]

<p>

<I>Des Moines Register</I> writer Donald Kaul, suggested that
Scalia &quot;occupies the outermost reaches of the right of the
court (some days you can only reach him by dogsled).&quot;[6]

<p>

What words could have possibly sparked such -- there's no other word
but <I>scornful</I> -- reactions from so many elements of the working
press? Scalia spoke to the crowd of 650 fellow Americans about the 
difficulty of upholding Christian beliefs, especially a belief in miracles,
in our increasingly secular society. He pointed out that the word
&quot;cretin,&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; is derived from the French
word for &quot;Christian,&quot; and added:

<p><blockquote>

<i>To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians taken
by modern society. Surely those who adhere to all or most of these 
traditional Christian beliefs are to be regarded as simple-minded.</i>[7]

<p>

The &quot;worldly wise,&quot; he went on:

<p>

<i>just will not have anything to do with miracles . . . [they
assume] that everything from Easter morning to the Ascension had to 
be made up by the groveling enthusiasts</i> (the disciples - ed.) 
<i>as part of their plan to get themselves martyred.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

In the midst of this cynicism, he concluded, &quot;We must pray
to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.&quot;[9] Justice 
Scalia's prayers came not a moment too soon. Those
who immediately attacked the speech, calling it contrary
to American tradition and inconsistent with his role as a judge,
seemed blissfully unaware that they were only confirming the truth
of what he said.

<p>

One professor of constitutional law at American University in
Washington, D.C., blasted the speech and remarked, &quot;We expect
our Supreme Court justices to be the most secular of our public
servants.&quot;[10] <b><i>We</i></b>? Where in our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution is it written that
judges must be less endowed with a sense of religious conviction
than other officials? The professor could only have been speaking
for that group of Americans who agree with <I>his</I> own expectation.
Most Americans <i>still</i> believe that every citizen, regardless
of their religious belief, is equal before the law. It is that
very equality -- the right of Christians to bring their full convictions
into the public square -- that Justice Scalia, and we at FRC, believe is 
under attack.

<p>

Don't let me leave the impression here that Scalia was without
defenders. Among them was syndicated newspaper columnist Cal Thomas,
who eloquently reminded readers that it was a rather
well-known &quot;public servant,&quot; Abraham Lincoln, who said,
&quot;But for this Book [the Bible], we would not know right from
wrong.&quot;[11]

<p>

Is there a difference between Presidents and Supreme Court Justices
in this regard? Our history and tradition say otherwise. The
Supreme Court begins each day of oral argument with the bailiff
stating, &quot;God save this honorable court.&quot; As you enter
the Supreme Court building, there is, on the right side of
the portico, a statue of Moses holding aloft the tablet of the
Ten Commandments.

<p>

The critics say, &quot;Those are mere symbols, devoid of meaning.&quot;
They believe that Scalia crossed a line that Justices must never 
cross -- expressing his religious faith. But once again, they 
don't know our history! Justices of our Supreme Court have time 
and again pronounced themselves about religious faith in general 
and Christianity in particular.

<p>

John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said in 1777:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers,
and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and the interest, of a 
Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

Imagine any public official saying something similar today! No
Christian leader or politician would echo Jay's observation today,
but the point is, such beliefs were not extraordinary among the
men and women who founded this nation. Daniel Webster is esteemed
as one of the five greatest senators in U.S. history, by resolution
of the Senate.[13] At the bicentennial of the Pilgrims' landing at
Plymouth Rock in 1620, Webster's keynote address included these
words:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Our ancestors established their system of government on morality
and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be 
trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any 
government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Whatever 
makes men Christians, makes them good citizens.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

In July 1835, when Chief Justice John Marshall died, the Liberty
Bell was rung, sustaining the crack that is one of the keys to
its fame.[15] Are American traditions affronted by the fact that the
Liberty Bell, one of a handful of supposedly secular American
&quot;shrines,&quot; bears the words of Leviticus 25:10: &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof&quot;?
In 1852, Justice John McLean wrote a letter asserting that &quot;Aside
from Revelation, darkness rests upon the world and upon the future.
The Bible has shed a glorious light upon the world.&quot;[16]

<p>

To all of these examples, dozens more could be added, from
Lincoln to McKinley to Coolidge, to TR and FDR, to John F. Kennedy,
to Jimmy Carter, to Ronald Reagan. Candid assertions of the importance
of religious beliefs to democratic institutions transcend partisan
divisions. It was Justice William O. Douglas, perhaps the Supreme
Court's leading liberal for nearly four decades, who wrote
that, &quot;We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;[17]

<p>

In short, what Justice Scalia said is in keeping with
a long line of statements by American jurists and statesmen. But
what about the substance of what he said? Do Christians face any
special level of scorn in modern society? Sadly, I believe they
do. Among the Beltway publications, the liberal <I>Washington Post</I>
published the most hostile appraisal of Scalia's speech. Of course, 
just a few years ago, they printed a front-page story suggesting 
that Christian voters are &quot;poor, uneducated and easily led.&quot;

<p>

Just a few weeks ago, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> printed a cartoon
showing a crucified Bob Dole. A crown of thorns was depicted lacing
his head, with the crown composed of letters spelling out, &quot;Christian
Coalition.&quot;[18] That same paper, on Easter Sunday, refused to
print the regular Johnny Hart comic strip called &quot;B.C.&quot;
because it referred positively to the Resurrection of Christ.
&quot;B.C.&quot; was out, and PC, political correctness, was in!

<p>

Perhaps the real scourges in our society today are reserved for
sincere religious believers <I>of any kind</I>. Consider what
happened to Marian P. MacDonald and Teen Challenge. Marian spent
32 years building an outstanding record as a public school teacher
in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was forced to resign her post
last month under pressure from the school system. The reason?
She invited members of Teen Challenge to one of her health and
physical education classes. Teen Challenge is an extremely effective
drug rehabilitation organization that incorporates religious principles
in its program.

<p>

The visiting teens told MacDonald's class they believed God had
helped them overcome drug abuse, but added, &quot;We are not here
to push our religion off on anybody.&quot; Apparently, that disclaimer
was not enough. The school principal sent a note home to parents
apologizing for the teens' &quot;insensitive comments.&quot; An
investigation followed, and MacDonald was essentially fired.[19] 
Stories like this are all too common.

<p>

I believe that Justice Scalia, whose sense of fairness and level
of scholarship are without match in the federal judiciary, has paid
religion the high compliment of taking it seriously. As I reported
to you last month, Christian convictions <I>are</I> cause for
persecution in many lands around the globe. Bigotry against
Christians in American, by comparison, seems mild; but that bigotry
is real nonetheless. Moreover, the aggressive, secularizing forces
in our nation today are committed to keeping you and me out of 
government, law, and the public debate on all the great issues.

<p>

True religious tolerance <i>is</i> the American way. But Justice
Scalia's critics would have you believe that the sanctity of human
life, traditional marriage, equal access of religious speakers
to the public square, and dozens of other ideas are merely a religious
creed and not the common code of civilization. In a healthy society,
Scalia's articulation of his private thoughts in the setting of
a private prayer breakfast would not have been news. That
they are news at all tells us a great deal about the crisis facing
America today.

<p>

I can assure you that, with your help, the Family Research Council
will continue to speak calmly, but passionately, in behalf of
moral values and true religious liberty. We hold with Daniel Webster
that good Christianity and good citizenship go hand in hand. And
we invite all Americans of goodwill to join with us in honoring
and preserving the values of family, faith and freedom.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. We'd love to hear from you this month. Many of you are already
aware of the &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; included
in my book <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> The Compact is designed
to renew the spirit of cooperation among our citizens. Its final
provision states, &quot;In our personal lives, we promise to honor
the Creator, who made us and endowed us with such unalienable
rights as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will
practice our faith on a daily basis and will gather with others
to worship regularly. Without resorting to coercion or vilification,
we will encourage faith, and the fruits of faith, in others.&quot;

<p>

Just check the enclosed reply card if you would like a free copy
of the Compact, suitable for framing. Thank you for your support
of our efforts on behalf of America's families and for reading
my letter this month. God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's July, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

July 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

The Bauer family had a close call last month.  An unusually strong
summer thunderstorm ripped through the Washington area, bringing
with it 150-mile-per-hour winds.  To make matters worse, a tornado
touched down on our street, knocking down trees and sending limbs
flying through walls and onto rooftops.  Fortunately, our house
was largely spared, but a neighbor's home was badly damaged.

<p>

My daughter, Elyse, and I were driving home through the storm
when the tornado hit.  I'll never forget the sight as we turned
down our street and saw how the severe weather had rearranged
the familiar objects of our daily lives.  The storm was gone in
a little more than an hour, but it was incredible how quickly
so much raw destruction was wreaked on our community.  Human beings
are no match for the forces of God's Creation.  We were struck
with a sense of awe -- and our hearts were filled with thanks that
the destruction was not worse and that no one was injured or killed.

<p>

That twister wasn't the only storm I encountered last month.
Throughout the month of June, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind
over the Republican Party Platform and the sanctity of human life.
Debate over the GOP's pro-life plank has been going on for years,
but this new storm kicked up suddenly and unexpectedly.  It came
about when Sen. Robert Dole, the certain GOP presidential nominee,
called for the addition of  a &quot;declaration of tolerance&quot;
to the platform, and suggested that it be applied <I>only</I>
to the abortion language.  That current language in the existing
platform says that the unborn child has a fundamental right to
life that cannot be infringed, and calls for a human life amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>

Let me say right up front that Sen. Bob Dole and I have known
each other for years.  I consulted with him last fall, at his
request, before he delivered his speech in Hollywood calling on
the entertainment industry to reverse its tide of sex-and-violence
for profit.  We have collaborated over the years on many other
issues.  A few weeks ago, Jim Dobson and I prayed together with
Bob in his Capitol Hill office.  I consider him a friend, and
I believe he would say the same about me.

<p>

But, in my humble opinion, Bob Dole is wrong about the pro-life
plank. It cannot and should not be changed.  Talk about revising
the plank has been swirling, of course, for months in GOP circles.
Some prominent pro-abortion Republicans, like Govs. Christine
Todd Whitman and Pete Wilson, have insisted on removing it altogether.
To do so would repeat the discussion that took place in the Democratic
party some years ago. The 1992 Democratic Platform endorsed an
abortion on demand philosophy.  A previous statement tolerating
the presence of pro-life Democrats in the party was stripped from
the platform.  As a result, President Clinton has vetoed every
attempt to restrict abortion, including those in the 7th, 8th
and 9th months of pregnancy.

<p>

All during the early summer, I was among a number of pro-life
leaders who were kept abreast of negotiations taking place among
leading Republicans.  After weeks of discussion, an agreement
was reached to include &quot;open door&quot; language in the preamble
to the platform.  That language would only state the obvious:
that the GOP platform stands for a set of principles, and that
not every member of the party agrees with every one of those principles.
The sanctity of human life would not be singled out or in any
other way watered down.  The current pro-life plank, powerful
and unequivocal, would remain as written. No deletions.  No dilutions.

<p>

This solution was acceptable, but within 24 hours Bob Dole himself
overturned it. He used a television interview to declare his
intention to put the tolerance language right in the pro-life
plank. Talk about a twister out of the blue!  This so-called
solution was totally unacceptable, and I said so publicly.  The
sanctity-of-life plank is among a handful of essential statements
in the GOP platform.  To attach &quot;tolerance&quot; language
directly to that plank would signal to the world (and the media
immediately interpreted it this way) that the Republican Party
regards it as one of the least important issues facing the nation,
when in fact the issue goes to the heart of the fundamental purpose
of liberty.

<p>

Just consider the impact of including tolerance language on another
subject, say, taxes:  &quot;We favor tax relief for overworked
Americans, but we recognize that many people disagree with us.&quot;
You would instantly recognize that the party which said this
wasn't serious about cutting taxes.  The same holds true for the
profound question of whether unborn children and their mothers
should be protected from the exploitation of abortions.

<p>

What followed my public criticism of Sen. Dole's proposal was
uncomfortable for both of us.  The senator took me on by name,
and major newspapers were happy to splash the dispute across page
one.  I kept my comments focused on the issues at stake, but it
was an awkward moment for me anyway.  Disputes among friends will
always draw a crowd of spectators.  But this fight, gut-wrenching
as it was, has an upside.  First, I have high hopes that, by the
time you read this, the dispute over the pro-life plank will be
resolved with an agreement that makes it clear that our children
deserve the full protection of the laws of the United States.
Second, this public argument gave me a rare chance to address
the nation on why the sanctity of human life matters so much.

<p>

National Public Radio, as liberal a media outlet as there is,
interviewed me in drive-time, and my comments were carried fairly
and without censorship.  <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington
Post</I> and other major papers accurately reported my defense
of our children.  The following weekend, I was invited to appear
on the prestigious CNN public policy show, <I>The Capital Gang.</I>
I was able to tell large segments of the American people what
our nation's abandonment of the sanctity of human life is doing
to the fabric of our society.  All of this came on the heels of
unprecedented media opportunities for the Family Research Council
(FRC), including appearances on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I> 
and <I>Face the Nation</I> and a write-up in <I>Time</I> magazine
featuring our principled stands.

<p>

Since all of this happened, I have heard from many people who
say they don't necessarily agree with FRC on every issue, but
that we give them something to think about.  This is vital to
remember.  Where &quot;tolerance&quot; language goes in the Republican
platform -- whether it's there at all -- isn't just a matter of dotting
&quot;i's&quot; and crossing &quot;t's.&quot;  If an issue isn't
important enough to appear in any party's platform, then it's
not worth a national conversation.  How we address the sanctity
of human life will determine whether this nation endures, or whether
it is torn away forever from the ideals that motivated our Founders.

<p>

Let me take a moment here to thank you.  In the middle of this
hot debate, hundreds of you called, wrote and faxed me your support.
Countless friends prayed for my family and for FRC.  Believe
me, we felt that encouragement.

<p>

My relationship with Washington leaders in both parties, including
Bob Dole, matters very much to me.  But the Family Research Council
is committed to speaking the truth:  on the needs of families,
on neglected children, on coarseness in the culture, on the virtue
deficit, and on the violence corroding our common sense of neighborliness.
We will speak the truth in election years and non-election years.
We will speak up when it pleases our friends, and when it doesn't.
To do otherwise would be to convert this organization into just
one more nest of political hired guns in the nation's capital.
I won't have that.  The issues facing America are bigger and
more enduring than one presidential race.

<p>

You will be happy to know, for example, that we are working with
a courageous band of Democrats in Congress who are struggling
to add &quot;tolerance&quot; language to the 1996 Democratic Platform.
This is &quot;tolerance&quot; language we <b><i>can</i></b> support
because it moves in the opposite direction:  it would say that
there is room in the Democratic party for people who champion
the &quot;little guy&quot; in the womb.  Unfortunately, I am not
optimistic about a change in their platform even though 40 percent
of registered Democrats hold pro-life beliefs.  For nearly a decade
now, the party has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.  Instead,
they have allowed radical feminists, the ACLU and gay rights groups
to turn the party into a vehicle for radical social change.

<p>

As I've emphasized many times before, FRC does not endorse candidates,
but we do work diligently to keep the issues affecting America's
families at center stage.  Toward that end, we will work with
anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely willing to espouse family-friendly
public policy.

<p>

While I'm writing to you, let me give you an update on another
&quot;contest&quot; in which I've been involved.  This is the
competition I proposed last January between two visions:  the
big-government philosophy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, <I>It
Takes a Village</I>, and the family-centered ideals of my book,
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This spring, Family Research Council
placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines challenging
the American people to compare the visions in these two books
and to choose the one that best represents their hopes for the
next generation of American children.

<p>

So here are the results to date.  The first lady's publisher
reports that 360,000 copies of <I>It Takes a Village</I> are in
print.  Those figures do not necessarily reflect actual sales.
A similar number of copies of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> have
now been sold, enough to put this little paperback on the Top
Five list of Christian best-sellers for the past three months.
In short, my competition with Mrs. Clinton is neck-and-neck.

<p>

I realize that this has happened only because thousands of faithful
supporters like you have bought multiple copies of <I>Our Hopes,
Our Dreams</I> and shared them with neighbors, friends, and fellow
believers.  I can hardly ask you to do more.  But consider this:
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> was written as a straightforward,
easily understood summary of what has drawn pro-family Americans
into the public policy arena in record numbers.  Can you think
of anyone -- an acquaintance or business associate -- who would benefit
from the couple of hours it takes to read this statement of pro-family
principle?

<p>

If you can, it's easy to use our &quot;800&quot; number to order
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> directly from us.  Better still,
however, you can take a step that will aid a vital voice in your
community and help boost the ranking of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
on the best-seller lists.  Visit your local Christian bookstore
and obtain or order a copy there.  Christian booksellers play
an irreplaceable role in spreading the Word, attracting new Christians
and encouraging &quot;old&quot; ones.  Many of these establishments
exist on a shoestring, and they struggle at this time of year.
Please take a moment to drop by and let them know you appreciate
their presence in your community.

<p>

Have a blessed and enjoyable summer (may it be as storm-free
as possible, too!).  From all of us at Family Research Council,
thank you for your support, and God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. Summers are a great time for families, a time for vacations
and building memories for a lifetime.  The only problem is that
cagey Washington insiders know that grassroots Americans are distracted
from their handling of critical issues. <b><i>This summer, FRC especially
needs your help</i></b>. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) <I>must</I>
be passed before a Hawaiian court acts in August.  The
Partial-Birth Abortion bill <I>must</I> get a powerful vote in
the House this month to override Bill Clinton's veto.  And we
<i>must</i> push for desperately-needed tax relief for families with
children before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
I hope you will prayerfully consider giving us your financial
support this month.  With your help, I am convinced that we can
stay in the fight and win. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's October, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

October 16, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

<i>Last month, just before the Congress adjourned, the Senate held its 
historic debate on partial-birth abortion.  At the end of an incredible 
day on Capitol Hill, I sat down at 1:00 o'clock in the morning to write 
you this "eyewitness account"</i>:

<p>

It's nearly 1:00 o'clock in the morning as I write this month's letter to 
you. I have just finished an unbelievable 20-hour day in which my emotions 
have run the gamut from exhilaration to deep despair.  The focus of 
today's events was the vote in the United States Senate to overturn 
President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. We lost that 
vote, but in the process we may have taken a giant step toward stopping the 
ongoing tragedy of abortion on demand.  Let me share with you a few excerpts 
from the roller coaster ride I was on today as we spoke the truth about the 
sanctity of human life to the powerful elites here in Washington, D.C.

<p>

My day began on the <i>CBS Morning News</i>, where I debated Kate Michelman 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  As is 
usually the case, the morning talk shows only give us four or five minutes 
to present our views on an issue -- this morning was no exception.  I knew 
I had to have my arguments down pat, for there is little time to hesitate 
or reflect when you're sitting in a TV studio under a bank of hot 
lights.  I also knew a sharp debater like Michelman would be sure to 
quickly fill any time I didn't use.

<p>

I often feel frustrated after such a debate because I don't usually get 
enough time to fully express my views or because I don't think of the 
best way to articulate some arguments until the debate is over.  But 
this morning was a "home run."  The CBS anchorwoman was fair, and she 
gave me equal time.  I was able to establish for the millions of people 
watching that partial-birth abortions <i>do</i> occur thousands of times a 
year -- most of them for purely elective reasons rather than because of 
health problems of the mother or her baby.  Kate Michelman presented few 
relevant arguments and seemed unusually low-key.  It had to be tough for 
her to defend the position that it could ever be okay to abort a baby in the 
eighth or ninth month of pregnancy by stabbing it in the back of the head.

<p>

But there was no time to relish the debate victory. I was immediately 
rushed from the CBS studio to attend an extraordinary prayer breakfast 
on Capitol Hill.  Pro-life senators led by Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania 
hosted the gathering to pray that senators' hearts would be touched 
before they voted.  The solemn gathering in that small room included 
some of the real "stars" of the pro-family/pro-life movement -- proven 
crusaders like Chuck Colson and my good friend and colleague Jim Dobson 
of Focus on the Family. We took turns asking God for His wisdom and 
strength for the tough hours of lobbying ahead.  More importantly, we 
prayed that God would have mercy on our country as it slips further 
and further into the culture of death.

<p>

A few minutes after breakfast, the ecumenical group gathered again -- 
this time in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  There 
we participated in a press conference on the upcoming vote.  Fourteen 
pro-life leaders made individual statements before a bank of TV cameras 
and a forest of microphones.  The room was jammed from one wall to the 
other, and the hot TV lights glared down on us all.  We were expecting 
the usual hostility of the liberal Washington media.  But again, 
strangely, there were no real arguments -- no hardball questions. Only 
one reporter even asked a question, and I was given the opportunity to 
answer.  He asked whether I was satisfied with the attention Bob Dole 
had paid to the issue. My response was clear: I told the reporter 
that Bob Dole was not responsible for partial-birth abortions.  I said 
we were here because Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill passed overwhelmingly 
by the Congress to stop these horrible procedures.  I then urged Senator 
Dole in the remaining days of the campaign to emphasize the issue and to 
draw the stark comparison between himself and his opponent so the 
American people could clearly understand their choice.

<p>

After the press conference, we all fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole 
lawmakers.  We met Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania as he got off the 
Capitol subway, and, even though he is usually pro-abortion, we ultimately 
won his vote. A few minutes later, we encountered Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware, and he ended up voting with us too.  Unfortunately, other senators 
were harder to convince.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas refused to hear 
us out when we appealed to her in the Senate dining room.  She said she 
didn't even think the Senate should be discussing the issue.  My good 
friend Kay James, who is a black American, told Mrs. Kassebaum that she was 
glad that her attitude didn't prevail in our country when slavery was 
being debated over 100 years ago!

<p>

As we walked the halls of the Capitol, the abortion debate was raging on 
the floor of the Senate.  Good friends, senators like Dan Coats of Indiana, 
John Ashcroft of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, led the floor debate 
while a hushed gallery of visitors looked on.  The pro-abortion side was 
led by Barbara Boxer of California.

<p>

We sat in the Senate gallery together to watch the proceedings -- myself, 
Dr. Dobson, Kay, Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America, Anthony 
Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and a dozen other 
allies.  As I looked around, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on 
in the minds of tourists from all over America who had brought their 
children there with them.  They seemed subdued, almost shocked, as they 
heard senators describe this terrible procedure.  At one emotional moment, 
one pro-life senator pointed to a picture of a baby and shouted in 
exasperation, "This is not an appendix; this is not a lump of tissue; this 
is a baby!"  Here's what happened next as reported by <i>The Washington 
Post</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of 
those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its 
rich wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a 
baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.

<p>

No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one spoke at all.</i>

</blockquote><p>

No one knows whose baby it was that brought the Senate to silence that day, 
but I can't help but believe that God chose that moment for this child to 
cry and, by so doing, to remind the Senate that "choice" in this case means 
the death of <b>real</b> human beings.

<p>

Soon the voting began.  As I am sure you know by now, our efforts helped 
win a clear majority, but we still fell short of the 66 votes needed to 
overturn Clinton's veto.  It was a tragic day, but even in the midst of 
our disappointment and heartbreak, there were some encouraging developments. 
I am convinced that something is stirring among God's people.  The 
cooperation of a large number of religious leaders from different 
denominations and from all parts of the country was unprecedented.  I'm 
convinced, too, that a new level of coalition building has been achieved 
and that the groundwork has been laid for better communication and 
cooperation in the future.

<p>

As the day wore on, my message was the same in every press interview. I 
told reporter after reporter that America is better than the vote that just 
took place.  I also told them that our nation was founded as a "shining 
city on a hill", that we are a unique experiment in liberty under God 
with rights and responsibilities that come only from Him. And this vote 
to allow the outright killing of nearly-born children through the promotion 
of abortion-on-demand sticks in our throats.  It will never go down easy 
with Americans because it violates every tenet of our founding.  Our 
conscience will not rest easy as long as we continue to allow the sacrifice 
of these children.

<p>

More than ever, I believe our beloved nation is at a crossroads, with the 
question Lincoln posed at Gettysburg still before us. As he stood on 
hallowed ground, he said we were conceived in liberty and asked whether 
"this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure?"

<p>

This is the great question facing our nation as we go into the next century. 
How we resolve the issues of life, family and marriage will determine whether 
America during the next century can still be that "shining city on a hill".

<p>

Even though the hour is late for our country, we must never cease our efforts 
to protect our spiritual heritage.  As God told Solomon, "if my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive 
their sin and will heal their land." (II Chronicles 7:14 NIV) We must 
redouble our prayers seeking God's mercy as the elites of our nation look 
farther away from Him. I want you to know that my staff and I are committed 
to do everything in our power to defend the values that have made our 
country great.

<p>

The Family Research Council is here to represent and serve you.  But I have 
to be honest. In recent weeks we haven't been hearing from enough of you. 
We need your encouragement, and your prayers, and we need to know if you 
stand with us in the battle for family, faith and freedom.  We also pray 
that, if you are able, you will choose to help FRC financially, <b>after</b> 
you have met the needs of your family and your church.

<p>

In closing, it's my prayer that God will richly bless you and your family. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. FRC is preparing a special analysis of the upcoming elections

<title>Gary Bauer's November, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

November 6, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

I know that your first reaction to yesterday's election returns 
is to be disheartened. I found myself recalling the words of Thomas 
Jefferson, who suggested that we should tremble for our country as 
we consider that God is just.

<p>

But, my friends, as people of faith devoted to the family, there must 
be no room in our hearts for demoralization.  It is not just that 
there were many bright spots on Election Day, including the 
strengthening of pro-family forces in Congress.  No, it's the fact 
that we are obliged in conscience to carry on our fight for the family, 
no matter what one day's election returns suggest. The worst thing we 
could do now is to retreat from the public square.  Instead we must 
advance the pro-family banner boldly and without shame.  I have hope 
for the future -- because the truth is on our side, 
the lessons of history are on our side, and, I believe, the will of 
the people is on our side.

<p>

I am not naive.  In the coming year, the principles that unite us -- 
traditional values, the sanctity of human life, smaller government, 
and lower taxes -- will be under political and cultural attack as 
never before. Regarding these threats, I can speak only for me and my 
"house" at the Family Research Council: "We will redouble our efforts to 
speak for your values and to bring the truth to the American people."

<p>

With that in mind, as election day approached, my staff and I put 
together a six-point plan of action.  Today, as the final vote is 
still being tallied we begin to implement this plan, with you at our side.

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family Americans have been too passive -- not <i>too active</i>! -- 
in their approach to public life.  Too often we've waited for our party system 
to produce for us candidates who will subscribe to some portion of our 
world view, candidates who, by design and default, always seem to fail 
us at the finish line.  The truth is, our movement should be producing 
and promoting leaders of its own.  I want you to know that achieving 
this goal is at the top of my personal priorities for the coming year. 
In my capacity as a private citizen, I will be organizing a political 
action committee, which I believe you'll be hearing a lot about in 
the near future.

<p>

<li>Each month 250,000 American homes receive our monthly publication, 
<i>Washington Watch</i>.  With your help, <b>FRC will double the 
circulation of this publication within the next 12 months</b>. Early 
next year <b>FRC will unveil a new and expanded version of <i>Watch</i></b>. 
We must make it our goal <b>to reach every American home in which 
there still burns a spark of love for this land Lincoln called 
"the last, best hope of Earth."</b>

<p>

<li>FRC will launch a youth leadership program here in Washington, 
D.C.  If the family is to survive (my friends, it <i>will</i> survive), 
if religious values are not to be completely routed from the public 
square (my friends, they <i>will</i> not), <b>we must act now to foster a 
new generation of leaders with a profoundly Christian world view.</b> The 
darker this night of cultural amorality becomes, the more youthful 
flames we must light that will kindle hope for our country.

<p>

<li>Our very self-government is at stake when the acts of duly elected 
legislatures, or of the people themselves, to restrict abortion, protect 
parental rights, and safeguard the institution of marriage are trampled 
by our runaway judges.  Judicial tyranny must end.  I pledge to you 
today <b>a sweeping campaign to check and balance our out-of-control 
courts.</b> We must become again a people who insist that <b>no one govern 
us without our consent.</b>

<p>

<li>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  How many of our 
government's destructive schemes would be possible if it did not 
seize nearly 45 cents of every dollar that hardworking families 
earn? There will be no freedom without tax freedom. <b>Today I am 
launching, in partnership with key economic conservative organizations, 
a massive push for across-the-board tax relief.</b> We will begin with 
tax credits for families with children and end the double taxation 
that occurs when government taxes the estates our families have 
shored up over a lifetime of sweat and sacrifice. <b>Our families 
built this capital; the meddling Washington establishment must be 
stopped from hauling it away.</b>

<p>

<li>Early in the new year, FRC will convene a summit of leaders of 
major pro-family groups and religious leaders who share our profound 
concern for the cultural decay now gripping the Western world. We will 
pool ideas and, where possible, resources to provide an effective 
counter to the forces of cultural disintegration.  Our response will be 
as global as the threat we face.  In the coming months and years, it is 
imperative that pro-family groups work together. <b>I pledge my total 
effort to help achieve this goal.</b>

</ul><p>

One final word. I do not view these steps as an ambitious plan. This 
is the <b>minimum</b> we must do to give this generation, and the next 
generation, of American families a fighting chance.  I cannot promise 
you we will succeed at everything we do, but I can promise you that we 
will try as never before. FRC has been positioned -- I pray by 
God's grace -- in the nation's capital to be here for the family at 
such a time as this.

<p>

In the coming days, please consider this plan and let me know if I have 
your support.  Your prayers and encouragement mean so much, and your 
financial support is FRC's very lifeblood.  I know that you are counting 
on the Family Research Council.  We will do everything we can to be worthy 
of the trust you place in us. God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<TITLE> Charles A. Donovan Article</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3> Written Testimony of Charles A. Donovan,<BR>
Senior Policy Adviser<BR>
Submitted on May 2, 1995 to the<BR>
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,<BR>
Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Chairman</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
MADAM CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer the testimony of the Family Research Council on the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.  The Family Research Council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to analysis of the impact of public policy on the traditional family.  We place particular emphasis on the ways in which society can preserve and strengthen the two-parent family, and maximize the benefits that stable, intact family structure can confer on this nation's economic vitality, social well-being and spiritual strength.
<P>
     We believe that the position of Surgeon General of the United States now, more than ever, requires an individual who understands these dimensions of public policy.  Evolu- tion of the office of Surgeon General in the past two decades has diminished its direct policy-making and admini- strative role.  Evolution of the nature of many of the public health threats facing this nation today has magnified the importance of the Surgeon General's office in articulat-ing the essentials of healthy behavior.  The intersection of individual health and moral responsibility has never been more obvious.
<P>
     For this reason, it is critical that the office of Surgeon General be occupied by a person who has worked comfortably within that intersection.  That person must possess a clear, and consistently expressed, vision of public health.  He or she must be alive to the profound ethical dimensions of health issues in the late 20th century, and have a proven track record of responding cor-rectly to issues as they arise, not merely riding with the tide of public or professional opinion.  In short, he or she must be a leader, not a follower, intellectually and instinctively true to the highest standards of ethical behavior in medicine.  
<P>
     As a threshold matter, a Surgeon General must know and be able to articulate who he is and what he believes.  From the very beginning, when President Clinton announced his choice of Herny Foster on February 2, this nominee has been unable to articulate from one day to the next a consistent account even of his own career.  At every turn, members of this committee, of our own organization, and of the press have elicited from Dr. Foster and the administration new and revised accounts of various dimensions of his creed and his practice.  To this day, not one of these accounts fully squares with the other.  To this day, not one of these accounts amounts to a full disclosure by the nominee regard-ing his personal involvement in the most wrenching health policy questions of our time.
<P>
     The course of this nomination resembles a tent in spring rain.  Touch its soggy canvas anywhere and more revelations seep through.  It is hard to imagine an individual who has been implicared in more major public health controversies than Dr. Foster.  From the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to involuntary sterilization of men-tally handicapped women, to the performance of abortions and advocacy of abortion on demand, to distribution of condoms and other birth control devices to children, to the school-based clinic debate, to involvement with radical sex education programs, Dr. Foster has been on the cutting edge -- and nearly always on its wrong side.
<P>
     As this testimony is written, it is impossible to say with assurance that he hasn't <B> always </B>been on the wrong side, because nothing of what is known about Dr. Foster's role in each of these controversies is the result of the nominee's frank and full disclosure.  Everything that is known about them is the result of examination of the nominee's record and repeated questioning of that record by others, our-selves included.  The Administration has been reluctant to take the first step to volunteer accurate information about any of the issues that have placed this nomination in jeopardy.
<P>
     Before discussing those issues in detail, I want to make one final point.  This nomination has not been, and is not being, "Borked."  No one has led an advertising campaign distorting the nominee's record, impugning his character, or implying dreaded, unnamed consequences for the nation if he takes office.  No one has scrolled through a list of his tastes in videos. The debate over this nomination is first and foremost about profoudnly important questions of public policy, and this nomination is in difficulty first and fore-most because the nominee himself has been unable to provide a consistent and accurate account of where he has stood and what he has done regarding these questions.  Even Robert Bork's most vociferous opponents will agree, I think, that he did not leave anyone in doubt about the authenticity of his beliefs.
<P>
     Doubt, on the other hand, is the essence of Dr. Foster's nomination.
<P>
<B> Biographical Omission</B>
<P>
     The difficulty with Dr. Foster's nomination began with the refusal of the White House to share with the public, and with this committee, his basic philosophy.  The biography of Dr. Foster released by the White House mentioned his chron-ological affiliations, but totally ignored his lifelong ties to Planned Parenthood.  That this would be the occasion for controversy can hardly be something the Administration would not recognize.  The <I> Chronicle of Philanthropy </I>has noted on several occasions that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is among the top 10 most frequently objected to "charities" in the United States.  The <I> Chronicle </I>has reported that no nonprofit in the United States is more commonly eschewed through "restricted" gifts to the nation's United Way agencies.
<P>
     The reasons are simple, and to express them is to belie the White House's claim that Dr. Foster is a "mainstream" nominee.  The nominee claims that he is committed to absti- nence as the primary approach to sex education.  Planned Parenthood has led the ideological and legal assault on abstinence education programs in the United States.  The nominee claims that he desires to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."  But he has served as a "Public Policy Advocate" for the Planned Parenthood Federation during a time when its national leadership had dedicated itself to opening 75 abortion clinics across the United States<I> merely to meet a numerical goal consonant with the 75th anniversary of its founding</I>.
<P>
     Dr. Foster has sought to portray himself as an advocate for the family, and for parent-child communication.  But during his time as an official of Planned Parenthood of Nashville, that organization filed suit against a Tennessee law requiring parental consent for abortion.  Far from being a strict statute, that law provided for a judicial bypass procedure by which teenagers could seek abortions under court auspices without parental involvement.  Such an arrangement was not liberal enough for Planned Parenthood, which has led the national legal fight to exclude parents from involvement with their minor children's abortion decisions.  Again, this is not a mainstream position -- Americans support parental consent for abortion by margins of 2-1 or 3-1.  Parents themselves show an even higher rate of support for such laws.
<P>
     It is possible that Dr. Foster was and is ignorant of these positions taken by organizations with whom he has been associated for nearly two decades.  But it is not likely. Ignorance is a valid defense in some circumstances, but it is not a valid credential for someone who seeks to become the "nation's doctor," and the leader of a national crusade against teenage pregnancy.
<P>
     The American people had a right to know of Dr. Foster's association with this organization and its ideas.  The White House had no right to omit it from the biographical informa-tion it provided the Congress and the nation.
<P>
<B> Tuskegee Institute</B>
<P>
     "Ignorance" is also the nominee's defense against the circumstantial evidence, and the direct testimony of one individual, Dr. Luther McRae, that, as Vice President of the Macon County Medical Society in 1969, Dr. Foster partic-ipated in a Public Health Service briefing on the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.  It is not in dispute that Dr, Foster spoke out against the experiments in 1972, when they were publicly revealed in media accounts.  It is pre-cisely that public expression of outrage that provoked the reaction of Dr. McRae, who has stated that he is willing to testify to this committee under oath that Dr. Foster was indeed present at the meeting on May 12, 1969 where PHS officials sought the "surrogate informed consent" of the MCMS for continuation of the Tuskegee Study.<P>
     McRae is categorical, and here is what he told Carl Ramsey of Family News in Focus:
<P>
<UL> The most striking thing about it, when
         the news broke . . . I saw on television
         and read in the papers that Dr. Foster 
         was involved in the public outrage about
         the study having been conducted.  And I
         was struck by that, in that I knew he was
         at the meeting . . . I asked myself why
         Henry didn't go ahead and say something at
         the meeting that night in 1969. Because he
         had every opportunity, nobody had a muzzle
         on him.i</UL><P>     McRae is also specific, recalling where Dr. Foster sat.  Moreover, he holds no animus against his colleague and believes -- in contrast to my view -- that he would make an excellent Surgeon General.  This fact lends added weight to his assertion regarding Dr. Foster's knowledge of the Tus-kegee experiment in 1969.
<P>
     Dr. McRae insists that Henry Foster did know about the existence of the experiment.  But it is equally important to recognize that he should have known, and that the May 12 meeting at a restaurant outside Tuskegee was not his only opportunity to inform himself about a PHS study that had been under way for nealry four decades.  First, the study had been described in the medical journals; as an obstetric-ical chief working in a county with one of the nation's highest rates of syphilis (indeed, this was one reason PHS originally chose Macon County as the site of the nontreat-ment study), at perhaps that county's most prominent ob-gy
center, Dr. Foster would have reason to be well read in the literature of venereal disease.
<P>
     Dr. McRae has noted, as does James Jones' account of the Tuskegee experiment, Bad Blood, that PHS officials supplied the Macon County Medical Society with a list of the individuals "participating" in the study, to assure that they would not obtain treatment, particularly antibiotics, by other means from local physicians.ii  Given the "zeal," as Jones puts it, with which PHS officials pursued the cooper- ation of Macon County physicians, it seems unlikely that distribution of this list to the Vice President of the Society's Vice President would be overlooked.<P>    Jones also points out that in 1970the PHS "also reestablished something of its former working relationship with medical personnel at John A. Andrew Hospital."  A representative of PHS, Dr. Joseph G. Caldwell, met with the hospital's administrator and medical director and contracted to have the surviving men's X-rays taken there in the hospital's new facility.  Again, it is possible that the presence of PHS officials, and the conduct of examinations of the syphilitic men, in the facility where he was chief of obstetrics would have entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Foster.  
<P>
     Assuming as much, however, it is hardly a flattering protrayal of Dr. Foster's engagement with public health issues when the most significant events of his time took place in his immediate vicinity, with the cooperation of the Medical Society of which he was Vice President, without his taking cognizance of them.  Such a lapse may not amount to much for a physician who simply desires to continue his work serving the general population; it is a fatal failure of responsibility in an individual who claims to have the ability to serve as the nation's top spokesman on public health.  Dr. Foster says that he did not know of the exper- iments.  The key is that nearly all his colleagues did, that at least one says that he himself did, and that, in any case, he should have known.
<P>
<B> Dr. Foster and Abortion</B>
<P>
     On the issue of abortion, Dr. Foster has taken the fifth.  That is to say, he has taken at least five posi- tions on the number of abortions he has performed or guided to completion.  He has misstated not merely his own involvement in abortion, but inaccurately described the guidelines on medical education under which, he claims, a study of prostaglandin suppositories was conducted during his tenure at Meharry Medical School.  Worse, he has used language in documents officially released by the Department of Health and Human Services that finesses the question of his involvement in abortion.  These finesses put his vera-city not merely in question, but in grave doubt.  
<P>

      formed one abortion during his medical career.<BR>
      ("Foster Says He Performed Abortions,"<I> The Wash-<BR>
      ington Post</I>, Feb. 4, 1995).
<P>
 <B> February 3, 1995.  </B>The Department of Health<BR>
       and Human Services releases a statement by<BR>
       Dr. Foster which states, " I believe that I<BR>
       performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy term-<BR>
       inations." (Statement by Dr. Henry Foster,<BR>
       Nominee for U.S. Surgeon General.)
<P>
 <B> February 6, 1995.  </B>The International Foundation<BR>
       for Genetic Research/Michael Fund releases a<BR>
       transcript, first disputed by the White House<BR>
       but then acknowledged to be genuine, in which<BR>
       Foster states, "I have done a lot of amniocen-<BR>
       tesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near<BR>
       700." (Department of Health, Education and Wel-<BR>
       fare, Office of the Secretary, Ethics Advisory<BR>
       Board, Meeting V, Friday, November 10, 1978<BR>
       Seattle, Washington, p. 180, 197).
<P>
       The Foundation also releases a story from the<BR>
       November 1980 <I> ObGyn News </I>describing an abortion-<BR>
       pill study conducted by Dr. Foster at Meharry on<BR>
       behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals that resulted in<BR>
        59 completed abortions on patients in the trial.     <BR>
<P>
 <B> February 8, 1995.  </B>Appearing on ABC's<I> Nightline</I>,<BR>
        Dr. Foster acknowledges performing 39 abortions, but<BR>
       notes that this does not include any abortions he<BR>
       may have performed before 1973.  Foster tells Kop-<BR>
       pel that this total also does not include the 59<BR>
       abortions carried out under the trial he super-<BR>
       vised, because he did not personally perform them.</UL>
 <P>
     Thus, in little more than a week, Dr. Foster deployed five different versions of his record regarding abortions.<P>
Volatility like this makes the Mexican peso look stable by comparison.  It prompted even the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Avis LaVelle, to remark, "The next time we utter a number [of Foster's abortions], it won't be based on Dr. Foster's recollec-tions."iii  But if you take a closer look at the February 3 statement released over his name, it appears amply crafted to disguise the information that was released on February 6 by the International Foundation for Genetic Research.<P>     As <I> The Washington Times </I>pointed out on February 7, Dr. Foster's artful February 3 statement offered circumlocu- tions regarding his term as chief of service at Tuskegee and Meharry.  Of the "wide variety of medical procedures and research" performed at both, "all," he wrote, "were in accordance with the law and educational requirements."iv  As the <I> Times </I>observed, "Abortion . . . has been legal for many years, and thus had Dr. Foster performed hundreds of abortions as chief of service - as opposed to acting in his capacity as a private physician - that fact would not have been actually lied about, given the statement's careful wording."
<P>
     The same can be said about the prostaglandin supposi- tory trial, which Dr. Foster was compelled to elaborate upon the following night in his exchange with Ted Koppel.  There he launched the "educational requirements" explanation, citing alleged accreditation requirements as the justifi- cation for seeking grant money to test the abortion suppos- itory for Upjohn.  There are two issues here.  One is the intended evasion by Dr. Foster of a full accounting of his abortion activity in his February 3 statement.  The second is his misunderstanding -- or possible evasion -- regarding the rationale for the prostaglandin trial.
<P>
     As chief of obstetrics at two major medical instituti- tions, Dr. Foster surely should have known that nothing in the then-extant accreditation guidelines from the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Education required any medical school to offer training in performing abortions, much less to conduct trials of experimental abortion drugs.  In relevant part, the guidelines state that:
<P>
<UL> Resident education [in obstetrics and<BR>
         gynecology] must include, but not neces-<BR>
         sarily be limited to the following:<BR>
<P>
         1. Obstetrics<BR>
         a. The full range of obstetrics, includ-<BR>
            ing high-risk obstetrics and medical<BR>
            and surgical complications of pregnancy.</UL>
<P>
     Arguably this standard could be interpreted as requiring training in the management of complications resulting from botched abortions, although the term "abor-tion" (or any euphemism for it) is nowhere mentioned in the standards.  Even under this reading of the standard, however, it would clearly be unethical for a program to arrange for a botched abortion to give the residents a training opportunity.  Conducting a trial of a new drug (one that never did reach the market) would just as clearly be an unethical way to fulfill such an obligation.
<P>
     But the bottom line is that no such obligation existed in the late 1970s when the trial was conducted, nor does one exist now, when Dr. Foster cites it as justification for Meharry's participation in the Phase 2 trial and uses it as a mask for a major abortion activity he obviously did not want disclosed.  It is only an added insult to common knowl- edge when Foster continues to cite this erroneous account of accreditation requirements to justify a project that was clearly taken on because of Dr. Foster's lifelong commitment to abortion.
<P>
     Finally, it should be pointed out that as of the date of this testimony, March 24, 1995, a complete accounting of Dr. Foster's activity on behalf of abortion is still not in the public record.  He has specifically excluded revelations regarding any abortions he may have performed prior to 1973, when he began his association with Meharry.  His basis for the exclusion is the unavailability of records prior to that date.  Given how well Dr. Foster's "recollections" have served him and the administration on other issues, it's just as well.
<P>
<B> Involuntary Sterilization</B>
<P>
     Dr. Foster's involvement in the possily involuntary sterilization of four mentally handicapped women is the only controversial issue in his background that was placed before the public by action of the White House.  Its discovery, however, was inevitable, as Dr. Foster himself described the prcedures in an article entitled "Removal of the Normal Uterus" in the <I> Southern Medical Journal </I>in 1976.v  Dr. Foster states in the article only that he had "begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.  Hysterectomy," he noted, "can be done <I>eithe</I>r [emphasis added] for sterilization or to eliminate the menses[.]"vi<P>     Whatever the presumed indication for the procedure, obviously hysterectomy eliminates both fertility and the menses.  This is important because hysterectomy carries significantly higher risks to the mother than the conven-tional means of sterilization (salpingectomy, i.e., removal of the Fallopian tubes).  As Stephen Trombley's valuable history of coercive sterilization makes clear, the United States in the early 1970s experienced a "sterilization explosion."vii  At least part of the impetus for the proce- dure (besides the desire of Planned Parenthood and other population control groups to promote permanent methods of sterilization, particularly on eugenic grounds) was the desire to provide medical students with the opportunity to perform hysterectomies.viii<P>
     This "sterilization explosion" did not go unnoticed or unopposed.  In fact, by 1973 the Health Research Group, affiliated with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, Inc. had pub-lished a major report on sterilization abuse.  The report documented the sudden rise in sterilization, particularly targeting the indigent, the uneducated and the young, and called for federal regulation, especially to ensure informed consent.
<P>
     This report provided the statistical and anecdotal basis for federal interest in sterilization reform, but as Trombley writes, the report attained its full effect "only after the problem of sterilization abuse was heightened by the personal tragedy of the Relf family."ix<P>     Interestingly, the Relf case took place in Alabama in 1973.  Once again a major public health controversy brewed virtually under Dr. Henry Foster's nose, without his being aware of it, and at a time when had begun to perform hyster- ectomies.  The Relf case deserves a brief synopsis.  A poor balck family living in Montgomery, the Relfs had three daughters, ages 12 to 16.  At the behest of the local family planning service, the three girls were injected with the contraceptive drug Depo-Provera.  In March 1973, the oldest girl, Katie was taken, without her parents' consent, to a family planning clinic, where an IUD was inserted over her objections.
<P>
     A series of events then brought the remaining two girls, along with their mother, to a local hospital, where the mother, unable to read or write, was induced to place an "X" on a document authorizing them, without hr knowledge, to be sterilized.  A subsequent effort by the family planning service to sterilize Katie failed.  
<P>
     That summer, the Relf case came to the attention of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who on July 10, 1973 invited the Relfs to his office.  By happenstance, Sen. Kennedy's committee was at that same time engaged in the hearings on health care and human experimentation spawned by the Tuskegee incident.  The Relfs proceeded to file suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, resulting in a judgment requiring the federal government to issue guidelines providing for the protection of minors from sterilization and for informed consent.
<P>
     Contemporaneous with <I> Relf </I>was the <I> Wyatt </I>case, in which a federal court declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that permitted the sterilization of mentally retarded inmates of state institutions.  Although compulsory steril-ization remained legal in many states during the 1970s, the issues raised by the Health Research Group and debated in the federal courts in Alabama had risen to national prominence two to three years before Dr. Foster's article appeared in<I> the Southern Medical Journal</I>.  Despite this fact, Foster's article makes no mention of these develop- ments, and betrays no awareness of any kind that, even in his own state, he was part of a rapidly dying consensus that such sterilizations as he had "begun" to perform were med- ically and morally unacceptable.
<P>
     As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote on February 17, the circumstances surrounding these surgical sterilizations (why higher-risk hysterectomies were performed, whether informed consent was obtained, and from whom) involve serious questions.  The apologia that Foster performed only four such sterilizations does not answer these questions; in fact, as Krauthammer notes, "It breyas an obvious discomfort with what Foster did.  It reinforces the sense that the moral climate of the 1970s was not nearly as alien as some pretend and that even in that ancient time surgically sterilizing the retarded was a morally troubling act."x<P>    I only note in passing that Dr. Foster's first account of abortions he performed was one.  Once again, Foster failed to notice a major public health controversy that sprang up largely as a result of incidents just down the road from the institutions he helped to lead.<P><B> I Have a Future</B><P>     The plausibility of Dr. Foster's commitment to abstinence as his first priority in educating young people about sexuality was discussed above.  One example should suffice.
<P>
     In 1987 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America distributed a report written for it by Marie Haviland-James, apparently affiliated with Michigan Planned parenthood.  The report was an ideological assault on "Sex Respect," one of the most venerable abstinence education programs in the United States.  The following account of the Haviland-James report appears in an analysis of sex education programs written and published in 1991:
<P>
<UL> The Haviland-James report provided guidance<BR>
       to Planned parenthood sex educators opposing<BR>
 <I> Sex Respect </I>and seeking its removal from the<BR>
       schools.  The memo urged opponents of <I> Sex <BR>
       Respect </I>to argue that it "violates the separa-<BR>
       tion of church and state" and risks litigation<BR>
       from the American Civil Liberties Union {whose<BR>
       late counsel, Harriet Pilpel, once represented<BR>
       both organizations].  It charged that the pro-<BR>
       gram is faulty because it contained "many refer-<BR>
       ences . . . to a 'spiritual' dimension of sex-<BR>
       uality; contained use of the word 'baby' for<BR>
       fetus"; expressed "bias . . . against people<BR>
       who are sexually active and unmarried"; "com-<BR>
       pared stealing of money continually with con-<BR>
       tinued sexual activity'; contained " a descrip-<BR>
       tion of a woman haunted by guilt"; omitted <BR>
       "pro-choice material"; and, of greatest inter-<BR>
       est, included "unsubstantiated claims" such as<BR>
       "abstinence has future benefits for teens" and<BR>
       "because of the special nature of human sexual-<BR>
       ity, there's no way to have premarital sex <BR>
       without hurting someone."  The memo concluded<BR>
       that <I> Sex Respect </I>"appeals . . . to the lowest <BR>
       common denominator of mentality."xi</UL><P>     Once again, the most chartible interpretation that can be put on Dr. Foster's involvement with an organization that takes this aggressive a stance against abstinence education is that he is wholly unaware of it.  Fortunately, there is more direct evidence of Dr. Foster's approach, which is at best "abstinence-plus," with the abstinence part thrust with embarrassment up his sleeve.
<P>
     The Family Research Council has obtained a copy of the eight-page brochure produced by Foster's "I Have a Future" program to introduce the program.  Over a couple of thousand of words of text, the word "abstinence", or its equivalents is not mentioned once.  The phrase, "delaying the initiation of sexual activity," common in all true abstinence materials, is not mentioned once.  On the other hand, the brochure repeatedly stresses the objective of the program to enhance "contraceptive availability," to address the problem of "poor" "contraceptive practices," and to promote "distribution of contraceptives."xii<P>     Efforts by the Council and the media to obtain a full copy of the "I Have a Future" curriculum have been rebuffed.xiii  If the currciulum is as its sponsors say it is, this reaction to public curioisity is itself curious.  In fact, one would expect that, upon his elevation to Surgeon General, Dr. Foster would proudly promote the "I Have a Future" curriculum as a model abstinence program.  His pride should be just as great before this committee votes.<P><B> Conclusion</B><P>    These are but a few of the issues that attend the nomination of Dr. Herny Foster.  Ther common link is that in 1995, the United States deserves to have in this position of authority an individual with a clear vision of the public health consequences of personal behavior, an abiding commit- ment to marriage and the family, an alertness to the ethical dimensions of today's contemporary controversies in medicine and public policy, an unblemished record of candor and truth-telling to the American people, and a concern for every mother and child.  
<P>
     Henry Foster has shown that he is not that person.

</center>

Since 1991, Kristi Hamrick has served the Family Research Council 
as director of communications, aggressively taking the pro-family 
message forward both in paid media (advertising) and earned media 
(news).  Mrs. Hamrick manages a broad operation that handles all 
in-coming requests from the news media -- from CNN to <I>The New 
York Times</I> -- and out-going media strategy, developing the 
framework for taking the pro-family message nationwide, via 
television, radio and print, and through such vehicles as op-ed 
articles or policy pieces.

<p>

The news operation at FRC, a pro-family policy and lobbying group, 
works to respond to breaking events and to look ahead at the trends 
that are shaping the American family.  The goal is to influence the 
cultural mindset by taking part in every pro-family debate as it 
happens.  Mrs. Hamrick is a spokesperson for FRC as well as a 
representative of the organization at events and conferences. She 
debates regularly on television, and her appearances include ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America, CBS This Morning</i>, NBC's <i>Today Show, 
The Montel Williams Show, Fox News</i>, CNN's <i>Jesse Jackson Both 
Sides</i> and numerous other CNN programs.  Her articles have appeared 
in <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/hamdoc.html"><I>USA Today</I></a>, 
and she has been quoted nationwide, in publications including the 
<I>New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Washington 
Times, USA Today, Boston Globe</I>, Gannett News, Knight Ridder News, 
and The Associated Press. Her voice can be heard daily on radio 
programs throughout the United States.

<p>

As part of the coordinated FRC effort, Mrs. Hamrick also develops 
media strategies as part of FRC's work in government relations, 
grassroots coalition building, research and policy development, 
corporate and community outreach and publication marketing.

<p>

Before joining FRC in 1991, Mrs. Hamrick worked as press secretary 
in the Hopkins for Governor Campaign.  Mrs. Hamrick was a spokesperson 
for the campaign and directed the media operation for the U.S. 
congressman from Kentucky when he won his primary bid. Earlier in her 
career, Mrs. Hamrick also worked in the press operations of the late 
U.S. Senator John Heinz and Senator Arlen Specter, both of Pennsylvania.

<p>

Most of Mrs. Hamrick's experience is in the media.  In Washington, 
D.C., she was an on-air correspondent for CBN News Washington, D.C. 
Bureau, covering social issues.  In print, Mrs. Hamrick worked for 
<I>The Muncie Star</I>, covering courts, crime and politics, after 
completing a Pulliam Fellowship at <I>The Indianapolis Star</I>. In 
fact, Mrs. Hamrick worked her way through college as a writer and 
journalist.  She continues the crafts of a wordsmith, working on 
occassion as a freelance journalist.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick's extensive speaking experience includes many appearances 
in schools and colleges.  She also taught news writing and advanced 
news writing at Ball State University in Indiana.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with honors in 
communications from Anderson University in Anderson, Ind. She and 
her husband, Michael Hamrick, reside in Northern Virginia.

<title>Gary Bauer's August, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

August 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
he giveth strength. Even the youths shall faint, and be weary; and 
the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord 
shall renew their strength; they shall mount with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not 
faint.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

<i>- Isaiah 40:29-31</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

While watching the Olympic games last month, I couldn't help
but recall these poignant words from the prophet Isaiah.  These
verses play a pivotal role in the classic film <I>Chariots of
Fire,</I> the true story of Scottsman, Eric Liddell, an Olympic
runner.  Liddell recites this passage from Scripture at a church
service held on a day he was supposed to run a race in the Paris
Games. <I>Chariots of Fire</I> tells how Liddell, a dedicated
Christian, refused to run on the Sabbath, standing by his personal
conviction in the face of intense pressure from the future King
of England and others.

<p>

Even though my athletic ability won't get me into the Olympics,
I must tell you that these hectic summer months have all of us
at Family Research Council (FRC) running hard.  Time and again,
we are led back to God's promise that He will renew our strength,
that he will enable us to effectively run the race and that His
strength will never fail.  FRC's staff has truly been pressed
to the limit in recent days, and just like Olympic athletes, we
have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Let me share with you, some of the many hills and hurdles FRC
has encountered.

<p>

This month, the major events requiring our attention are the
conventions of national political parties.  The Republicans met
first in San Diego, followed by the National Taxpayer's Party,
Ross Perot's Reform Party, and finally the Democrats.  The Libertarian
Party has already nominated its presidential candidate.  As a
non-partisan organization, FRC continues to focus its energies
on providing each of these parties with a detailed agenda for
families. As I reported to you last month, FRC has advocated
the pro-family agenda in a wide variety of public forums and we
will continue to do so regardless of  the response we receive
from party leaders and the media elite.

<p>

As you read this, chances are I'll be returning to Washington
after having taken the pro-family message to the GOP Convention
in San Diego.  We have urged each of the nation's political parties
to make America's families a priority.  We want Democrats, Republicans,
and the smaller &quot;third parties&quot; alike, to see &quot;family&quot;
<b><i>not</i></b> in terms of election cycles, but in terms of daily
responsibilities and everyday needs.  We have urged them all to
adopt platforms that strengthen marriage, recognize the sanctity
of human life, cut taxes for families, and to pay increased attention
to the cultural decay undermining our society.

<p>

In San Diego, I addressed a rally at Sea World designed to urge
the GOP to uphold its commitment to the sanctity of life, to lower
taxes on families and to work for economic opportunitiy and growth.
I made our case to convention delegates and to the national media,
who always crowd these events.  In the weeks before the conventions,
my schedule was crammed with appearances on network and cable
talk shows to discuss the issues at stake during this election
year.  Incredibly, FRC was cited more than 1,500 times in the
print media nationwide in June.  Needless to say,  FRC Press Secretary,
Kristi Hamrick and her quality staff are incredibly busy.

<p>

For my part, there was CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; to discuss
the GOP platform plank on abortion, an appearance on &quot;Crossfire&quot;
with former Gov. Carroll Campbell to discuss the presidential
campaign, another visit to the weekly commentary show, &quot;The
Capital Gang,&quot; an interview with Ollie North on his daily
radio show and numerous other media opportunities.

<p>

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, FRC has provided in-depth research
and related resource materials to lawmakers who are concerned
about the attack on traditional marriage. Our recent full page ad in
<I>USA Today</I>, which I described in my June letter, was just 
the opening move in our effort to inform citizens
about the potential impact of an expected court decision in Hawaii.
This decision would recognize same-sex marriages and potentially
impose similar recognition on other states.

<p>

To most Americans, I suspect, the reason that one man/one woman
marriage is so vital to the survival of our society almost goes
without saying.  But in these times, people need regular, convincing
reminders about the fundamentals.  That's why FRC recently hosted
a briefing on Capitol Hill, which gathered together a group of
distinguished scholars, physicians, and public policy experts
to discuss the far reaching implications of  &quot;same sex&quot;
marriage.  The briefing was carried live on C-Span, and was re-aired
several times during the next 24 hours.  As a result, millions
of Americans had the opportunity to join with legislators and
congressional aides to see and hear the powerful testimony that
was presented.

<p>

The arguments against homosexual marriage are convincing and
familiar -- so familiar, in fact, that many of us have forgotten
how to effectively articulate them.  FRC's briefing brought together
people like adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former homosexual
Anthony Falzarano (who now leads Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries
in Washington, D.C.), Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley
Arkes, psychiatrist and former Yale University Fellow, Jeffrey
Satinover, and FRC's own Bob Knight, each of whom drove home the
essential values that are at stake in this debate. <i>(To help
you understand and articulate the arguments, FRC has condensed
this briefing into an hour-long video -- see the enclosed
reply card for information on how to obtain a copy for your church
or action group.)</i>

<p>

One week after the briefing, I found myself in the thick
of things again as I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  Disappointingly,
most of the senators who attended are very liberal and they are
also in favor of allowing same-sex marriages.  Before I testified,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), a primary opponent of DOMA, used the
hearing to attack the bill.  His central point was that marriage
laws traditionally have been made by the states, and that DOMA
would violate the principle of &quot;federalism,&quot; which says
that Congress will not interfere with the powers of state government.
Unbelievable! Ted Kennedy, quoting &quot;states rights,&quot;
while he has been the major proponent of bigger and bigger government
here in Washington. Maybe cows really can fly!

<p>

Kennedy left before I testified, but as I was finishing my remarks
he returned to the hearing room, so I couldn't resist a jab.
&quot;Senator Kennedy,&quot; I said, &quot;this is the first
time in your career you've made such an outstanding defense of
federalism.&quot;  The usually somber hearing room broke into
raucous laughter, and the liberal senator from Massachusetts sank
back into his chair speechless.  The irony is, DOMA makes a powerful
statement in support of the right of each state to ignore the
radical judicial inventions of other states.  It's true federalism
all the way.

<p>

On the day after my testimony, the full House of Representatives
voted for DOMA 342-67.  This 5-1 margin of victory makes it clear
that DOMA <b><i>is</i></b> mainstream and that the aggressive ambitions
of the homosexual lobby <b><i>are not</i></b>.  In the coming days, FRC
will continue scrambling to help ensure that DOMA passes the Congress
without amendments and goes to the president for signature.  We
intend to do everything we can to send the Hawaii courts -- and liberal
judges everywhere -- a powerful message.

<p>

Here are several other fronts on which FRC has been fighting
for America's families:

<p><ul>

<li>FRC Director of Legal Policy, Cathleen Cleaver, has been in
the thick of the raging debates over computer pornography, cable
porn, and social issues from assisted suicide to religious liberty.
Cathleen played a key role in the recent adoption of the Communications
Decency Act, a bill passed by Congress earlier this year that
will help keep distributors of computer porn away from our children.
A federal court in Philadelphia struck down this law, but Cathleen
has begun work on FRC's legal brief to the Supreme Court, which
is likely to hear the case this fall.

<p>

FRC is also fighting for the right of citizens to offer sidewalk
counseling to women seeking abortions.  Cathleen prepared a brief
to the Supreme Court in the <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I>
case and she is working with other lawyers to prepare oral arguments
to be made before the Court. Two major assisted suicide cases
are also getting our attention.  Either one could lead to a landmark
Supreme Court ruling which would protect human life, or put millions
of elderly and handicapped Americans at risk.

<p>

Finally, Cathleen is taking her effective debating skills before
some very tough audiences, and more than holding her own.  This
summer she has debated cable porn with Elliott Mincberg of People
for the American Way. She also locked horns over computer porn
with the government relations director of America On-line (a
longtime lawyer for the porn industry.) The computer porn debate
was shown on C-Span to a national audience.

<p>

<li>Robert Maginnis, FRC Policy Analyst has continued to spearhead
our Military Readiness Project. Bob came to FRC from the U.S. Army,
following his retirement, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Together with Melissa Wells-Petry, the Armed Forces' acknowledged
expert on the policy banning service in the military by homosexuals,
Bob has guided FRC's work this summer on three major court cases
regarding the ban. One of these cases, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
may soon be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>

Bob has been working diligently on the drug issue as well, and
one glance at the trends will tell you how urgent this is.  In
the past three years, drug abuse has spiraled, especially -- and
most disturbingly -- among elementary school-age children using
gateway drugs like marijuana.  Bob recently attended a major
international drug conference in Sweden, and in early August he
met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar,
to lay out FRC's specific concerns.

<p>

<li>Then there's Marty Dannenfelser, FRC Director of Government
Relations, and his excellent staff who have worked long and hard
on the effort to override the Clinton veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban. A vote in Congress, on this issue, is expected
soon after Labor Day. Marty's experienced team also played a
major role in the passage of a new bill which creates a national
commission on gambling, working in conjunction with our friend,
Congressman Frank Wolf (R- Va.).

<p>

<li>FRC has also been blessed to have the talents of Bob Morrison
and Jennifer <i>A</i>. Marshall on education issues, Jennifer
<i>E</i>. Marshall (that middle initial is not a misprint -- the
mail-sorting staff at FRC has its hands full!) on welfare reform
and voluntarism, Ryan Dobson (Jim Dobson's son) on youth issues,
and Steve Knudsen, our new director of state and local affairs,
who helped put together our recent press conference with state
family policy councils to endorse laws barring same-sex marriage.

</ul><p>

These are just a few of the activities that have kept FRC moving
at a sprinter's pace this summer. I wish I could tell you more
about the work of each and every member of our dedicated staff
members in Washington, D.C. and in Holland, Michigan, where our
constituent services and information systems teams are located.
FRC's team is top-notch, and it includes you, our beloved supporters.
Working together, we can make a significant difference in the
future of our country... in the way our families, our children,
and our grandchildren will spend their lives.

<p>

Thank you for all you do to help keep FRC moving forward. Your
involvement in our work is essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. While we've been busy running the race, financial support
for our work has fallen into the typical summer doldrums.  Your
help would give FRC a special boost right now, so please consider
making a contribution if you possibly can. Again, thank you -- and
God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's March, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

March 8, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Washington is even more hectic than usual these days and the
Family Research Council (FRC) seems to be working 24 hours a day.
While Alaska, Louisiana and Iowa held caucuses in February,
March is the big month for primaries in this presidential year as 
voters in state after state determine whom they will vote for. 
South Carolina led off on March 2.  Twelve more states vote between 
March 5 and 7.  &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; -- which isn't that 
super anymore because so many states have moved up
the date their primary -- follows on March 12.  California votes
at the end of the month.

<p>

By the end of this month, if not sooner, we may know
the name of the Republican presidential nominee.  On the Democratic
side, President Bill Clinton is unopposed and his renomination is 
virtually assured.  Third party candidates like Ross Perot and Jesse 
Jackson may still emerge.

<p>

In all of my contacts with friends of the Family Research Council,
no question is asked me more often than this one:  &quot;Gary,
which candidate for the White House will keep his word and do
the most for families?&quot;  I wish I could answer that question.
But, as I've often mentioned in my letters to you, endorsements
aren't -- and cannot be -- the business of FRC. 
The authors of our tax laws have prohibited nonprofit groups
like FRC from participating in or attempting to influence the
outcome of any election.

<p>

Even more importantly though, our mission is education, and our
goal is the promotion and protection of the traditional family.
Our message is profoundly conservative, but we believe that this
message is both the heritage and the hope of all Americans.  FRC
is in a unique position to bridge the purely partisan conflicts
of our time and to offer a vision of enduring values that any
person of goodwill can embrace.

<p>

But even though I can't tell you whom to vote for, I can talk
to you candidly about issues that I know concern you deeply.
(Our role is to keep pro-family issues at center stage.)  What
has this still-young election year already told us about what's
on the hearts of the American people?

<p>

The answer, I believe, is both worrisome and uplifting.  The
worrisome side is simple.  Voter turnout has been mixed -- lower 
than expected in Iowa, near-record levels in New Hampshire.
Last November, Family Research Council conducted a nationwide
poll which confirmed the fact that a large majority of Americans
believe this nation is on the wrong track, and that the primary
reason for the decline is moral decay.  If Americans are dispirited
about the future and stay away from the polls, the problems we
face will be even more difficult to solve.

<p>

The uplifting part of the answer is that many Americans aren't
dispirited, and they are exercising their rights of citizenship in search 
of change. To better understand what those voters are saying, first we 
must understand what the politicians are saying.  Let's start with
President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address on January 23.

<p>

Remember what was going on back in 1992?  For much of that year,
&quot;family values&quot; took it on the chin from the major media.
Vice President Dan Quayle took aim at Murphy Brown, the fictional
TV heroine, over her deliberate decision to conceive a child out
of wedlock.   Quayle endured a hail of scorn, from Hollywood to
the halls of Congress.  The Vice President was charged with everything
from making too much of a TV show to trying to &quot;divide the
nation.&quot;  All of this happened merely because he suggested
that America's culture shouldn't encourage family break-up and
promiscuity.

<p>

But the attack on family values didn't stop there.  After the
1992 presidential election, pundits both inside and outside the
GOP made &quot;family values&quot; the scapegoat for the defeat
of President George Bush.  The GOP platform, with its clear statements
on abortion and homosexuality, was the cause, these writers said,
of the first Democratic presidential victory in 16 years.  This
analysis was ludicrous, but it became the accepted wisdom.  George
Bush lost for a number of reasons, including running a poorly
strategized campaign and breaking his promise of &quot;no new taxes.&quot;

<p>

Now lets flash forward.  Before a crowded House chamber and a
national television office just five weeks ago, Bill Clinton made
a speech that had cultural values as its primary theme.  He talked
with feeling about welfare reform, getting tough on drugs, reducing
teen pregnancy, and jawboning Hollywood directors into taming
violence on television.  This time, the pundits were silent. 
The next day, The <i>New York Times</i> merely noted that 
Clinton's &quot;values talk&quot; had wide public support.

<p>

In this atmosphere, the Republican presidential race has likewise
gone forward with a sharpened focus on family issues -- and those
issues seem to be boosting the candidates who express them most clearly. 
The sanctity of human life is a major example. Much of official 
Washington believes that abortion and euthanasia are just the kind of 
&quot;divisive&quot; issues that doom politicians to the margins
of public life.  But advocates of the right to life have played a 
major role in the primaries to date. Liberal pundits overlook the 
fact that the two most ardent champions of legal abortion in the 
race -- Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Gov. Pete Wilson of 
California -- dropped out months ago for lack of public support.

<p>

Defending the right to life is one way to stand up for &quot;the
little guy.&quot;  A similar sentiment may be driving the voter
response to candidates who speak to the average family's economic 
insecurity.   The families who read my letters regularly understand 
this insecurity very well.  Their tax burden has soared in the past
generation.  In many cases, economic pressures have forced both
Mom and Dad to work.  Too many families are living from paycheck
to paycheck.  If the economy turns down or wages continue to stagnate,
what will these families do?

<p>

On top of this is the indifference of so many in government -- and
others on Wall Street who seem to think globally while ignoring
things that matter here at home.  Americans sense that the strong
ties of loyalty and community which have always bound us together
are fraying.  Major companies close factories here and open new
ones overseas, where labor costs are drastically lower.  American
workers who have lost their jobs are told by some conservative
leaders that what's happened to them is just a &quot;structural
adjustment.&quot;  &quot;Don't worry,&quot; they're advised, the
U.S. economy will be the healthier for it 10 years down the road.
I can still vividly remember my own father, sitting at our kitchen
table in despair after he lost his job.  Every family worries
whether such a scene will be played out in their own kitchen.
Some leading liberals counter that the answer to the problem
is retraining, or &quot;lifelong learning,&quot; a response that
seems a little glib to working men and women worried about mouths
to feed today and tomorrow.

<p>

Underlying all of this is a sense that something has changed
in America.  America's families have shouldered the burdens of
World War II, Vietnam and the Cold War.  They have borne each
cross bravely, run the race, and won the crown -- but still their
government will not let up and allow them to keep a little more
of what they earn.  America's families built the world's greatest
peacetime economy, shared their resources to rebuild post war
Europe, even assisted Japan in making the transition to a modern
industrial democracy.  They have founded global institutions to
keep the peace, and risked nuclear holocaust to resist the nightmare
of communism.  For all their pains, they have been rewarded with
political leaders in both parties who tell them they are selfish
because they want to keep American jobs on American soil.

<p>

&quot;You must be patient,&quot; these leaders say -- all the while
committing vast amounts of our hard-earned tax money to programs
that do not work, to bureaucrats who delight in interfering with the 
religious rights of the people, to artworks that scorn the values of
the people who foot the bills, and to lavish retirement programs
for a class of permanent legislators who have abandoned the ideals
of Madison and Jefferson.

<p>

Today, barely 10 weeks into this election year, the voices of
the forgotten Americans are being heard.  On issue after issue -- tax
reform, parental choice in education, control of illegal immigration,
campaign finance reform, term limits, support for the institution
of marriage, sanctity of life -- voters are gravitating toward candidates
who are saying that <b>values do matter</b> and that power and resources
must begin flowing away from Washington and back toward families
and local communities.

<p>

That same message was at the core of the 1994 congressional elections.
It may be one reason why a record number of longtime incumbents
are retiring from the House and Senate this year.  It's rare that
anyone in Washington voluntarily gives up the reins of power.
But in one sense, that is what is being asked of every politician
in the nation's capital.

<p>

Our welfare system is destroying families? Then return power
to the states to innovate and enlist more aid from private charities
to combat poverty.  Academic achievement continues to decline?
Then return authority and resources to local school districts.
Economic growth is faltering?  Then lift the burden of tax and
regulation that is stifling entrepreneurs.

<p>

It's no accident that these are the concerns defining political
trends in this election year. They are the same concerns that fill the 
letters I receive every day from friends of FRC. 
What ties so many of these issues together is concern for our children's 
future.  We inherited a nation that was free. We were a nation where a 
man's word was his bond.  We were a nation where a person trying to start 
a business was hailed as a pioneer, not hauled before a dozen permit boards 
like a suspected criminal.  We were a nation where parents could let their 
children spend an afternoon watching a double feature at the local theater
without fearing they would be saturated with sex and violence
on the screen.  We were a nation where the &quot;village&quot;
did, to borrow Hillary Clinton's word, help raise children, but
always with respect for parental authority.

<p>

That nation had its deep flaws -- racial prejudice, for one.  But
to that problem we have now added others.  We have kept the bathwater 
and (all too literally!) thrown out the baby.

<p>

FRC believes that the national public policy debate is too important
for families to sit on the sidelines.  We will continue to put
ideas and research on the table that will chase the ghosts of
relativism from our public life.  We will continue to insist that
some values are good for families, while others are bad. We will continue 
to fight for the causes that endure:  respect for every human life, the
honorable bonds of husband and wife, the virtue of sexual restraint,
the daily love that only a parent can lavish on a child.

<p>

These are the themes that guide FRC.  I wish I had enough space here 
to tell you of all the activities in which our government relations and 
policy staff are now engaged.  Be sure to read the latest <i>Washington 
Watch</i> for all the details -- weekly updates are available
from our legislative hotline at 202-783-HOME.  And don't forget
to consult the enclosed reply card for information on the latest FRC 
resources.

<p>

Thank you for your prayers, your encouragement and your financial
support.  Your partnership with us is essential to our success.
Slowly but surely, this great nation is awakening to the dream
of restoring its families and communities.  God bless you for
all you're doing to help turn this dream into a reality.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  Our hope that millions of Americans will learn more about
the pro-family agenda is coming true.  The response to my book,
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, has been excellent, but the best
news is that we are reaching a wide secular audience as well.
Two major book chains, Walden Books and B. Dalton, are now carrying
it!  I've just received word that <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>, one
of the major resources that booksellers and librarians use to
determine what books they will acquire, will carry a review of
the book.  Thank you for your prayers and for all you're doing
to help get this resource in the hands of people who are considering
and embracing our issues! Let's keep the momentum going!

Dear Friend:

<p>

A few weeks ago Carol and I drove our oldest daughter, Elyse,
back to college for her second year of studies.  It was wonderful
to have her home for the summer, and saying good-bye was really
hard.  The summer months flew by, reminding us once more how precious
is the time that we have together as a family.  Even though Elyse
attends college only a few hours' drive from our home outside
Washington, D.C. -- close enough for us to see her on some weekends -- 
she's still much farther away than we would prefer.

<p>

Millions of families go through this emotional ritual each September,
and it doesn't really matter that much whether your child is heading
off to college, high school, or to a nearby elementary school
classroom.  Each fall mothers and fathers face the same anxieties
and pressures:  how will my children fare in school?  Will their
teachers recognize their special qualities?  Will teachers honor
and respect their talents and beliefs or will they try to convince
them to &quot;question authority&quot; and reject the values they
have been taught?  What about their classmates?  Will they make
friends?  Will those friends help uphold their faith?  Or will
their faith be weakened?  Or worse, will our children be lead
into trouble?  Is there anyone out there besides us who really
understands the worth of our beloved children?

<p>

Today, questions like these are being asked by every parent and
they unfortunately have a special sharpness to them.  Many of
our nation's schools are no longer the &quot;common ground&quot;
of shared values and aspirations that generations of families
counted on them to be in the past. All too often, today's classrooms
are laboratories for radical ideological experimentation. The
teaching profession has been politicized as never before. Textbooks
and lesson plans routinely foster a liberal world view. Attempts
to isolate, intimidate and confuse religiously inclined students
continue. Violence and illegal drugs are found even in elementary
schools. The &quot;safe sex&quot; philosophy still dominates
sex education.

<p>

I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics on educational decline,
so I won't repeat them here.  The public education establishment
routinely goes out of its way to question the depth of the problem,
but, in the same breath, rushes to endorse the latest reform plan,
a tacit admission that our schools are falling short.  Let me
be especially clear here:  many, if not most, of our teachers
are dedicated educators who are motivated by a love of learning
and of children.  Many, if not most, are disturbed by the same
education fads that distress parents.  Like parents, these teachers
are ill-served by education leaders who are constantly reinventing
the wheel and interfering with what works in real classrooms.

<p>

In fact, the education policy debate of the last few years has
been dominated by the <I>illusion</I> of reform. With every fiber
of their being, the leadership of the nation's massive teachers'
unions, the National Education Association (2.2 million members)
and the American Federation of Teachers (900,000), have opposed
nearly every change in the way our schools are financed and operated.

<p>

Bogus education reform schemes come and go.  Many of them have
impressive-sounding names and a stellar line-up of sponsors.
Desperate for signs of improvement that will give their children
hope, parents are sold various reform packages under such brand
names as Outcome-Based Education, Goals 2000, character education,
mandatory voluntarism, New American Schools and restructuring.
These schemes have different details, but they have at least
two omissions in common:  they leave the basic method of funding
public education untouched, and they leave parents at the margin
of education decision-making.

<p>

The Family Research Council (FRC) is keenly aware of the concerns
expressed by America's families about education, and we are dedicated
to reversing these omissions.  We want parents to control their
education dollars.  We believe that the same hands that rock the
cradle, smooth the fevered brow, set the table, and clothe the
child should direct the funds that educate the child.  The centerpiece
of our campaign for education reform is massive tax relief for
families with children, coupled with genuine parental choice policies
that enable parents to select the school their children will attend.

<p>

Today, more than ever before, I am optimistic about our chances
for success.  School choice plans are gaining momentum and making
headway.  A new study by Harvard's Paul Peterson and Jay P. Greene
at the University of Houston shows that the City of Milwaukee's
parental choice plan has resulted in real academic gains for the
children enrolled in the program.  In August, state courts in
Ohio upheld the constitutionality of a school choice program that
includes religious schools.  Tax credits for families with children
will now be a centerpiece of this year's election debate.

<p>

Most importantly, I'm encouraged that, in the true spirit of
America, parents are not waiting for politicians to respond to
their needs.  They are moving in pioneering numbers to options
like homeschooling, classical education and parent-based education,
which are not so much novelties as rediscoveries of the art of
family-centered teaching and learning.  At the center of all of
this is spiritual renewal, the faith that moves mountains.

<p>

With all of the forces at work in today's education debate, FRC
has developed the <I>Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</I>.
This 64-page booklet is packed with resources to help you through
the coming school year.  Between its covers you'll find:

<p><ul>

<li>A glossary of education jargon -- what do the fancy terms 
<I>really</I> mean?

<p>

<li>Feature articles on major topics like Outcome-Based Education,
the religious rights of students, and parental rights in today's
schools.

<p>

<li>Addresses and phone numbers of key resources for homeschooling
and classical education.

<p>

<li>A reference section containing everything from newsletter sources
to web sites dealing with education issues.

</ul><p>

Our <I>Survival Guide</I> is designed to put a wealth of helpful
information at your fingertips.  It's yours for a donation of
any amount -- please use the enclosed reply card to order your copy

<p>

I had intended this letter to deal solely with education issues,
but drug abuse and educational failure feed off one another.
There is no way to dismiss the disturbing statistics: in the
war against teenage drug abuse, America is in full retreat. A
new federal survey shows that teen drug use has risen 105 percent
since 1992.  The sharp increases span every form of illegal drug.
Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent; cocaine
use, 166 percent (from 1994 to 1995 alone); marijuana, 105 percent.
One of every 10 teenagers has used an illegal drug in the past
month.

<p>

The tragedy here is that these numbers come after a decade of
progress.  By 1992, teen drug use had been driven to its lowest
point in decades.  The reason for that progress was and is easy
to understand. Our nation's policy was direct -- and repeated over
and over again in every forum where young people gather.  It said:
&quot;Drug abuse is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.&quot;  But
then, following a change in the Oval Office, we changed course.

<p>

The flow of anti-drug messages from our nation's capital dried
up.  The Clinton administration cut the office of National Drug
Control Policy some 83 percent.  MTV, and even the networks, began
to produce material that winked at the drug threat, or openly
declared the war on drugs a failure. Leaders in Congress turned
their attention to other issues. Treatment funds were reduced,
and &quot;civil libertarians&quot; ratcheted up their pressure
on highly effective social agencies like Teen Challenge that use
faith-based messages to help teenagers and young adults kick the
habit.

<p>

Let me say something here about the liberal versus conservative
debate about the treatment versus law enforcement approaches to
drug abuse.  In fact, let me say one word about it -- it is a 
<I>fallacy.</I> Both approaches are needed.  Drug abusers need treatment
if they are to re-enter society as productive citizens.  But the
truth is that even the best treatment programs are only partially
successful. Preventing the abuser from taking that first hit,
snort, or injection is crucial.

<p>

Who would propose that we eliminate hospital emergency rooms
to treat automobile accident victims?  No one, of course.  Then
again, who would argue that we eliminate speed limits, safety
belts, guard rails, and the like because, after all, we have emergency
rooms? But that's precisely what advocates of drug legalization
argue! Remember when then-Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested
that problems like crime would be reduced if America legalized
drug use, saying it was time to study this option and rely on
treatment rather than law enforcement?

<p>

Elders, thankfully, is gone, but the legacy of permissiveness
she represented is reflected in what is happening now to our youth.
Last month, my senior adviser for drug issues, retired Army Lieutenant
Colonel Bob Maginnis, met with General Barry McCaffrey, President
Clinton's drug czar.  Gen. McCaffrey is a dedicated man, but he
has his work cut out for him.  FRC offered the general our heartfelt
support and suggested various ways to recapture the initiative.
New efforts to control the flow of drugs through Mexico and out
of Colombia are especially needed.

<p>

Again, we must not settle for illusion.  Attempting to treat
an ever-rising wave of drug-abusing youth will destroy our economy
and bankrupt this nation -- and, worst of all, waste the potential
of thousands of our children. Attempting to reform education
without putting parents back at the center of school decision-making
is doomed to fail as well. As always, on both of these issues,
FRC will continue to fight for the home truths that really matter:
we will work with legislators, government officials -- anyone of
goodwill, regardless of party -- who recognizes the need to strengthen
our education system and to gird our children against the sex-and-drug
culture.

<p>

We would really like to hear from you this month.  Your financial
gifts to FRC provide the lifeblood that enables us to advance
the pro-family cause.  Your prayers and involvement are essential,
too.  The cards and letters we receive provide a tremendous lift
to me and the entire FRC staff.  Because the work we do is both
draining and difficult, being able to associate names and faces
with the cause we are advancing makes our efforts all the more
meaningful.

<p>

Once again, thank you for your faithfulness.  As we continue
to work together, we can move closer to our hope and dream of
family renewal in our beloved nation.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. As our <I>Survival Guide</I> illustrates, FRC is constantly
developing new materials that make the case for family values.
Let me close by mentioning another resource that you've helped
to make a household word: <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This
companion book to the family values debate of 1996 has now reached
a total distribution of nearly 400,000 copies.

<p>

I conceived <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> as a vision for a pro-family
future -- a book that would make the case for our cause to a cross-section
of the American public. Earlier this year, FRC took out paid
advertising posing a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
had just released her book, <I>It Takes a Village.</I> We asked
the American people to choose between the alternative visions
represented by these books.  I'm pleased to report that, thanks
to support like yours, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> has held its
own in this contest of visions.

<p>

Our original goal was to distribute 1,000,000 copies of <I>Our
Hopes, Our Dreams,</I> and to get them into the hands of people
who may not know just how much today's cultural clash over the
family means to them. If you can help us make one last push to
reach this goal and to spread the pro-family message, please take
this opportunity to do so. The enclosed card has all the information
you need.

</center><p>

Early in 1995, Miss Marshall joined the Family Research Council's 
public policy team to contribute her research skills and experience 
in the field of welfare. Her responsibilities as policy analyst 
include tracking, analyzing, and writing about proposed legislation 
on welfare reform. In addition, her analysis and research benefit 
FRC in educating key decision makers in the U.S. Congress and at the 
grass roots nation-wide.

<p>

Through her studies at Rice University, in various internships 
throughout her undergraduate experience, and most recently, at the 
American Enterprise Institute with Charles Murray, Marshall has 
developed a keen understanding of compassionate welfare reform and 
school choice as well as a familiarity with the U.S. Congress and 
the formulation of public policy. 

<p>

Miss Marshall began her career in Washington as an intern in the 
Office of Congressman Tom DeLay in the summer months of 1990 and 
1991. In 1992, she served an extended internship in the White 
House Office of Political Affairs during the critical months of 
the campaign. She moved on to work in the Office of the Deputy 
Convention Manager at the 1992 Republican National Convention, with 
particular responsibility for caucus teams. Since then, she has worked 
in the Houston office of George Bush and, in 1993, in the office of 
the Deputy Executive Director at the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee.

<p>

Through the years, she has volunteered time for local Republican 
party activities and campaigns, both local and Presidential. Her 
campaign experience includes a stint as opposition research 
coordinator for a Congressional candidate in Houston. 

<p>

Native of Texas, Marshall graduated <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> from Rice 
University in 1994 with majors in Policy Studies and English. She is 
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Rice Fellow.

<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95c2dr.html">Legalization of Drugs: 
The Myths and The Facts</a>: an article by Robert L. Maginnis

<p>

After a distinguished career in the U.S. military, Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert (Bob) L. Maginnis, USA Ret., joined the Family 
Research Council in 1994 to handle one of the most difficult 
social problems facing American society and American families 
today -- the crisis of crime.  In addition, Colonel Maginnis' 
skills as an analyst, writer, speaker and team leader will be 
applied to family issues impacted by military/foreign affairs 
policy and cultural issues. Already nationally known as an expert 
on the Pentagon and a spokesman on military issues, Colonel 
Maginnis brings to FRC a broad perspective on today's toughest 
issues.

<p>

In his many roles, Colonel Maginnis has appeared on ABC, NBC and 
CBS evening news shows, CBS "This Morning," "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
Newshour," CNBC "Cal Thomas," CNN's "Crossfire" and "Larry King 
Live" as well as other programs, such as "Donohue," and on numerous 
networks.  He has been quoted many times in newspapers across the 
country from the <I>New York Times</I> to the <I>LA Times</I>.  
His editorial pieces have been published in the <I>Washington 
Times, Orange County Register, Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald</I> 
and elsewhere. And the colonel has been featured on most major radio 
shows nationwide.

<p>

In July 1993, Colonel Maginnis retired from an assignment in 
the Pentagon where he served as an Inspector General.  He is 
an airborne-ranger infantry officer with an assignment history 
that includes Korea, Germany, Alaska, and several posts in the 
continental United States.  He served in command and staff 
positions in four infantry divisions from platoon to division 
level.  The colonel was the chief for the U.S. Army Infantry 
School's leadership training branch.  He developed curricula, 
taught, participated in leader development research and consulted 
with leaders and soldiers throughout the Army. He is the author of 
more than fifty articles published in professional military 
journals concerning ethics, leadership, and personnel matters 
impacting the military.

<p>

In the last eight months of his military service, Colonel Maginnis 
was a member of the Army's study group examining the homosexual 
ban.  He also was advisor to the Defense Department Military 
Working Group on homosexuals in the military.  In that role, he 
debated the issue in the media as well as speaking in various forums 
-- including testifying before a House subcommittee. Because of his 
expertise, Colonel Maginnis is also, on occasion, a spokesman for 
the Defense Readiness Council, a non-profit organization that led 
the fight to keep the homosexual ban.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis' service in the armed forces was commended with 
the Legion of Merit, the highest peacetime decoration, as well as 
with five meritorious medals and four commendations. Among his over 
fifty letters of commendation is one from former President Jimmy 
Carter who honored the colonel for inventing a laser training 
device, at great savings to the armed forces.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis received his B.S. from the United States Military 
Academy, West Point, New York in 1973 and a M.S. from the Naval 
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in 1983.  He is also 
a graduate of many military schools, including the Command and 
General Staff College.

<p>

Long active in his community and in many organizations, the colonel 
now coordinates his church's participation in homeless shelters. 
He, his wife and two children live in Northern Virginia.

<title>Gary Bauer's Monthly Letters</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center>
<img src = "/townhall/FRC/letters/letterbn.gif">
</center>
<br>

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of

<H3><I> CLINTON'S FLAWED NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR DEAL:  AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR STRENGTHENING U.S.  POLICY </I></H3>
<P>
By Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., Ph.D. 
<P>
Committee Brief #9<br>
Originally published at 6 pages on March 4, 1995
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     Mr.  Chairman, members of the Committee, I applaud your decision
to hold this hearing on the October 21 "Agreed Framework" with North
Korea.  It is my belief that this committee, now under new management, has
the opportunity to provide leadership as the Congress, the Administration,
and our allies seek a path to peace on the Korean Peninsula.  This is a vital
American national security goal since our economic interests in the region
are high and since Korea is the only place where large numbers of U.S. 
troops are in harm's way. 
<P>
      Since its inception 22 years ago, The Heritage Foundation has
actively advocated American policies to promote peace and freedom on the
Korean Peninsula.  For more than twenty years I have traveled regularly to
the Republic of Korea.  Just last month, I visited Korea on what I believe
was my 43rd visit.  During that trip, I had the honor to meet again with
President Kim Young Sam and Prime Minister Lee Hong Koo.  Given the
many questions raised both in Seoul and in Washington about the Agreed
Framework, I assured President Kim that the new Congress would
extensively review the new nuclear accord with North Korea. 
<P>
           Judging by some media reports and Administration
statements, one might conclude that the North Korean crisis is over.  Many
observers were eager last year to congratulate the Administration on its
nuclear deal with North Korea, and the issue quickly faded from the front
pages.  In late January one could hear CNN reporters refer to the "nuclear
issue that has been resolved."  Just last February 14 -- a week ago -- as he
took time to criticize the National Security Revitalization Act of the
Contract With America, Defense Secretary William Perry said that the
Agreed Framework had "stopped the North Korean nuclear program in its
tracks."
<P>
          I would suggest that the Secretary was premature in his
assessment.  Even the most optimistic estimates hold that we will wait at
least a decade for the Agreed Framework to result in the dismantling of the
visible portion of North Korea's nuclear weapons facilities.  If fully
implemented, the October agreement can serve as a basis for real progress
in ending North Korea's nuclear threat.  But we must also be mindful of
North Korea's consistent strategy of attempting to drive a wedge between
the United States and South Korea, the agreement's limitations, and the
capacity of North Korea to manipulate and undermine the agreement.  The
agreement was not even four months old when, on Wednesday of last week,
the North Koreans threatened to walk away from the accord rather than
accept South Korean light-water nuclear reactors.  To put it mildly, it may
become necessary to adjust what appear to be inflated expectations of this
agreement.
<P>
          Real peace on the Korean Peninsula will depend on much
more than a bilateral "framework" between Washington and Pyongyang. 
We must remain mindful that our wider interests in Korea and Asia are
deeply affected by this agreement.  But others, such at the 43 million
citizens of our Republic of Korea ally, have even more at stake.
<P>
          How this agreement could affect our alliance with South
Korea is of fundamental importance.  This agreement cannot succeed
without Seoul's cooperation, as well as our consistent recognition of Seoul's
interests as we proceed.  Vital American security and economic interests are
at stake, as well.  We have 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea.  South
Korea is now one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and an increasingly
important global partner for the United States.  A South Korean, Dr.  Kim
Chulsu, is now a leading candidate to head the new World Trade
Organization -- a bid, incidentally, that I believe deserves American support. 
Beyond the immediate safety of our citizens and soldiers, both Washington
and Seoul know that tension reduction on the peninsula will go far to ensure
peace in Northeast Asia.  With that, Americans, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese,
and Russians will continue to profit from Northeast Asia's enormous
economic potential. 
<P>
           But still an obstacle to such a promising future is North
Korea's insular, well-armed, and hostile regime.  The December downing
of an American helicopter which strayed into North Korean airspace and the
resulting death of one serviceman and the lengthy detention of another are
but the most recent reminder that we have not achieved "peace in our time"
with Pyongyang.  The North still deploys a 1.1 million-man military against
the South, designed not for defense but for a blitzkrieg operation to conquer
its neighbor.  The 13 million people of Seoul, plus many of our troops who
are about as far away from North Korea's artillery as we are now from
Baltimore, are in a constant state of danger.  North Korea's record of
terrorism has been reviewed numerous times before this committee.  Last
year, the North's long-time dictator Kim Il Sung died, yet the new
leadership structure remains unknown.  North Korea is a country shrouded
in secrecy and well-known for unpredictability and violent acts.
<P>
          Recognizing the danger posed by North Korea's plutonium
reprocessing, the Bush Administration addressed the challenge frontally,
initiating a series of integrated policy moves which produced considerable
progress before the November 1992 elections froze these effects.  The Bush
Administration worked closely with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo, not only
to address the nuclear issue, but to advance North-South reconciliation.  Our
efforts encouraged talks between North and South Korea that resulted in two
landmark agreements on denuclearization and reconciliation in December
1991.  The former specified that both North and South Korea would possess
no nuclear weapons or plutonium reprocessing facilities and provided for
North-South mutual inspections.  The latter agreement called for sweeping
political, economic, and social confidence-building steps.  The enthusiasm
with which these agreements were greeted recalls the enthusiasm of last
October.  However, neither of the 1991 agreements has been implemented
because of North Korean intransigence. 
<P>
           It should be recalled that Pyongyang signed the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 but subsequently refused inspections
stipulated by the treaty.  The Bush Administration did, however, pressure
Pyongyang into allowing the first-ever inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1992.  Those inspections revealed that
North Korea had very likely produced significant amounts of weapons-grade
nuclear fuel.  Suspecting serious violations of the NPT, the IAEA called for
special inspections of two suspect sites in February 1993.  Pyongyang's
response the following month was to announce its intention to withdraw
from the NPT.  North-South talks also have been stalled since then.
<P>
          A slowly building crisis atmosphere ensued and led to the
Agreed Framework of last October.  To reach this agreement, however, the
Administration abandoned a bipartisan principle of U.S.  policy it had
previously accepted from the Bush Administration.  This core principle was
that there would be no improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations until
Pyongyang satisfied all of its commitments to the International Atomic
Energy Agency and to Seoul.
<P>
          For example, one might inquire what Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Gallucci meant when he said in September 1994, "I wish to
leave no ambiguity on the point that there will be no overall settlement... no
provision of light water reactors, until the question of special inspections is
settled."  As we now know, these special inspections that the IAEA has
requested for two years will not take place until elements of the light-water
reactors are in place -- a process that will take at least five more years.
<P>
          Was there an alternative to abandoning this principle of full
transparency?  I believe there was.  In June last year, my Heritage
Foundation colleague Daryl M.  Plunk issued a paper that called for a more
modest, though fair, "package deal" that would have linked reasonable
political and economic rewards to Pyongyang's full compliance with the
IAEA demands and with the 1991 North-South denuclearization agreement. 
But instead of demanding full North Korean nuclear transparency, the
Administration decided to grant the North rewards, including relaxed trade
rules, exchange of liaison offices, a half-billion dollars worth of fuel oil, and
a multi-billion-dollar nuclear power plant project well before transparency
is established.
<P>
          There are three other aspects of the Agreed Framework that
I call to the Committee's attention. 
<P>
 I wonder about the legal and political standing of an "Agreed Framework." 
It is not a treaty, and it is not an executive agreement.  What is the precise
status of what the Administration signed last October? 
<P>
 There is the issue of the October 20 letter that President Clinton sent to
"His Excellency Kim Jong Il, Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea."  In it, the President says that, in the event that this
reactor project is not completed or alternative fuel is not provided for
reasons "beyond the control of the DPRK," he will "use the full powers" of
his office to provide the reactors and fuel, "subject to the approval of the
U.S.  Congress."   If the Administration is not able to arrange for
multinational funding for the promised reactors and fuel, what is the
potential liability to the American taxpayers?
<P>
Then there is the issue of North Korea's present ability to build nuclear
weapons.  The Agreed Framework does not provide for obtaining North
Korea's previously produced weapons-grade plutonium.  Both the IAEA and
our own CIA have repeatedly said that it could provide the basis for one or
two nuclear weapons.  Other sources have placed this capability significantly
higher.  This capability may not present a broad strategic threat to the
United States, but it could pose a very potent threat to South Korea and to
the nations of the region.  It is quite possible that, while reaping generous
benefits from the agreement, the North is at this very moment building
nuclear bombs. 
<P>
      It is my assessment that Seoul, despite its public support for the
Agreed Framework, remains troubled, especially by the last point I
mentioned.  In addition, Seoul remains legitimately concerned that
Pyongyang is actively seeking to use the agreement to pressure Washington
into concessions that are aimed at isolating South Korea or at least putting
distance between Seoul and its U.S.  ally.  This is the goal of Pyongyang's
April 1994 demand that the Military Armistice Commission that manages
the 1953 Armistice Agreement be replaced by a bilateral U.S.-North Korean
peace treaty.  It is also the goal of Pyongyang's repeated refusal to accept
South Korean light-water reactors, even though Seoul will be paying most
of the bill.  I remind the committee that the Administration has assured us
in the past that the North agreed to South Korean technology.  This is yet
another instance of North Korea reneging on its promises. 
<P>
           Mr.  Chairman, the October deal was not the best deal the
United States could have achieved.  It is my hope that its defects will be
fully investigated by this committee and other committees in both houses of
the Congress. 
<P>
           I do not want to suggest, however, that the agreement be
abandoned.  We only have one President and one Secretary of State at a
time.  Instead, I would like to suggest that the Congress can take a
leadership role in strengthening the implementation of this agreement.
<P>
          A lasting peace for Korea cannot be achieved solely through
agreements between Washington and Pyongyang.  The key to lasting peace
is North-South dialogue.  The Congress can promote this by focusing on the
principal requirement for real progress on the Korean Peninsula:  North
Korea's entering into a genuine and productive dialogue with South Korea. 
Section Three of the October agreement obligates North Korea to resume
this dialogue.  But we can surely expect Pyongyang will make every effort
to avoid this requirement indefinitely.  In fact, it gives every indication that
this is its intention.
<P>
          This must not be the case.  Congress can and should speak
strongly to this part of the agreement and in that process help the
Administration restore a balance to its goals.
<P>
          To do this, Congress should pass a joint resolution expressing
its view that future funding and political support for the Agreed Framework
be heavily dependent upon steady progress in improved North-South
relations.  Easing the nuclear crisis is not enough.  American interests are
best served by more sweeping tension reduction steps.  This is the principle
embraced in a resolution that has been introduced in both the House and the
Senate (H.  Con.  Res.  19 and S.  Con.  Res.  4), and I urge this committee
to consider this important initiative.  It is important to note that this
carefully crafted bill works within the requirements of the Agreed
Framework, and does not amend it.
<P>
          Passage of this joint resolution will advance the cause of
peace in three ways:
<P>
It will put North Korea on notice that it must take real and substantial steps
to reduce tensions with South Korea.
<P>
It will send a much-needed message of support to our ally, South Korea.
<P>
It will encourage the Administration to move beyond the narrow pursuit of
non-proliferation goals to a broader agenda that advances resumption of a
productive North-South dialogue and long-overdue tension reduction.  This,
I would suggest, offers the best chance for securing an enduring peace on
the Korean Peninsula.
<P>
     In closing I would like to share with the committee what a former
senior government official of the Republic of Korea wrote me in a private
letter dated February 20 following a visit to Washington and New York:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     To be frank with you I was quite disturbed to find that there
     seems to be an unmistakable trend among the people in and
     out of the Administration to de-link implementation of U.S.-
     North Korea accord from the progress of North-South
     dialogue.  As you would agree, there is a great danger in this
     approach and this will be the most thorny point between
     U.S.-Korea relations for some time.
     <P>
     Certainly the resolution in the Congress urging linkage
     between the two tracks will be of great significance in
     correcting the Administration's course toward a more
     desirable direction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     After a slow start, the new democratic governments in Eastern
Europe are taking decisive steps to dismantle command economies
inherited from their Stalinist predecessors and to build genuine free
market systems. Yet a number of external economic shocks, including
the temporary spurt in oil prices generated by the Persian Gulf war,
and the collapse of trade with a dying Soviet Union, now threaten
these fledgling economies. Needed desperately in coming months and
years are increased trade with and investment from the West. 
<p>
      Severe Problems. East Europeans are faced with severe economic
problems. Energy price increases due to the Gulf war alone cost
Hungary $2 billion and Czechoslovakia $1.5 billion in hard currency.
Although oil prices have returned to near pre-Gulf war levels, the
massive below-market-price imports of oil from the Soviet Union have
made East European countries far more energy dependent than the West.
Moreover, Soviet oil deliveries to Eastern Europe have plummeted since
1990, sending East Europeans scrambling to set up barter deals for oil
with individual Soviet republics. Soon they will have to pay for this
oil, too, in hard currency, eating up most of the hard currency
earnings that otherwise could be put to use by private investors to
help build their economies.
<P>
      East Europeans also are suffering from the rapid economic
deterioration of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe's largest trading
partner, and a drastic drop in intra-East European trade. East
European exports to the Soviet Union fell 48 percent in the first half
of this year, while imports from the Soviet Union dropped 41 percent.
The drop in East European and Soviet trade cost Czechoslovakia alone
over $2.5 billion by April 1991. Unless new markets quickly are
discovered for East European goods, thousands of state and nascent
private industries will go bankrupt. 
<P>
      In an attempt to assist the new democracies of Eastern Europe
during this time of economic trial, the United States Congress now is
hammering out the final version of a foreign aid package for the
region. While well-intentioned, the legislation will do little to
encourage economic growth and ease the precarious foreign trade
situation in Eastern Europe. 
<P>
      Failed Policies. The bill relies mostly on those standard
foreign aid policies that in the past quarter-century have failed
dismally elsewhere in the world. These include ineffectual technical
assistance offered mostly by the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID), and government loans and grants, which actually can
delay economic development by removing incentives for wide-ranging
economic reform. 
<P>
      The West Europeans are counting on a new multinational bank, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to be their
main instrument for promoting economic development in Eastern Europe
and the Soviet republics. There is little reason, however, to believe
that this development bank will be any more successful in fostering
economic growth than the other West European efforts or the World Bank
have been in Africa. 
<P>
      East Europeans need and deserve more than traditional foreign
aid. Ultimately, they need expanding trade with the West, which will
create markets for their goods and increased Western investment. This
will enable them to modernize and expand their industries and services
to make them more competitive. 
<P>
      Alternative to Aid. This view is shared by many East Europeans
themselves. Czech Finance Minister Vaclev Klaus, Polish President Lech
Walesa, and Russian President Boris Yelstin repeatedly make the case
for access to Western markets and increased Western private investment
as an alternative to aid, which they view as detrimental to national
pride and to economic development. 
<P>
      It is in America's political and economic security interests for
the East Europeans, eventually including the former Soviet republics,
to make the transition from command to market economies. As leader of
the world's free market economic order, America should take the lead
in opening markets for East European goods and in pushing for Western
companies to do business in Eastern Europe. The Bush Administration
should do this by adopting a five-plank program for promoting trade
and investment in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics: 
<P>
Plank #1: Offer to negotiate free trade agreements between the U.S.
          and the East European countries, including the former
          Soviet republics. This would increase trade with the region
          by encouraging increased American investment and offering
          Eastern countries secure access to the giant American
          market. 
<P>
Plank #2: Lower U.S. trade barriers for goods and services from
          Eastern Europe and the republics and exempt their exports
          from all tariffs for five years. Unilaterally reduced trade
          barriers to Eastern products will provide East Europeans
          with markets for their products and help American consumers
          by lowering the price of imports.
<P>
Plank #3: Withhold U.S. funding for the new European Bank for
          Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) until the European
          Community (EC) agrees to reduce significantly trade
          barriers to Eastern Europe. This will press the EC, which
          has a tremendous political and economic stake in the EBRD,
          to open its markets to Eastern goods. 
<P>
Plank #4: Allow for "tax sparing" with East European countries and
          former Soviet republics. The U.S. should follow the example
          of other industrialized countries like Germany and the
          Netherlands and spare its right to levy higher U.S. taxes
          on American multinationals when they are granted tax
          holidays by countries in Eastern Europe and the former
          Soviet Union. This would reduce taxes for many American
          firms in the region, thereby increasing American investment
          in the region.
<P>
Plank #5: Reduce taxes on Americans working in Eastern Europe and the
          republics. This would give a greater incentive for top
          American businessmen to spend more time in Eastern Europe,
          where their expertise is needed.
<P>
WHY AID DOES NOT SPUR ECONOMIC GROWTH
<P>
      Despite a plethora of well-intentioned plans now being
considered by Congress and the Bush Administration, foreign aid will
not lift Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union out of the poverty caused
by decades of communism. Most government assistance programs in fact
do more harm than good. Generous food aid to Poland in 1989, for
instance, impoverished thousands of Polish private farmers unable to
compete with free food from the West. Due to Western generosity,
Polish farmers had to stand by helplessly watching as their own grain
and meat rotted for lack of demand.
<P>
      Technical assistance programs, while better than most foreign
aid programs, nevertheless also have a poor track record. According to
World Bank officials, only three out of nineteen major technical
assistance projects undertaken in Africa in the past five years have
been even moderately successful in accomplishing their goals. (Laura
Wallace, "Reshaping Technical Assistance," Finance and Development,
December 1990.) Government technical assistance projects in Eastern
Europe appear to be doing little better. Poles and Hungarians
frequently complain that the thousands of Western bureaucrats sent to
advise them on matters ranging from environmental regulation to
democratic institutions are of little help because they often have
limited knowledge of local circumstances.
<P>
      Government-to-government loans and grants can be particularly
detrimental to economic development. Grants often are used to
subsidize inefficient state industries, reducing the incentive to
undertake needed, if temporarily painful, free market economic
reforms. Loans can saddle countries with enormous foreign debts, as
Latin Americans and others painfully have learned. And, of course if
countries default on loans guaranteed by the U.S. government, American
taxpayers foot the bill. In addition to their economic costs, direct
loans and grants have adverse political effects. Often, for example,
loans to foreign governments reinvigorate the power of local
government bureaucrats -- in the East many of them communists -- by
giving them control over where aid is directed within the country. 
<P>
      Equal to Marshall Plan. Ignoring the lesson of foreign aid's
dismal record, massive amounts of Western cash are flowing into
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Over $16 billion in bi-lateral
and multi-lateral Western aid is targeted for Eastern Europe this year
alone. This massive aid infusion is just about equal, when adjusted
for inflation, to U.S. Marshall Plan aid to Western Europe after World
War II. (Susan M. Collins and Dani Rodrik, Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union in the World Economy (Washington, D.C.: Institute for
International Economics, May 1991), p. 85.) 
<P>
      The popular myth is that the Marshall Plan was an unqualified
success. The reality however is that the Marshall Plan had mixed
results at best. Instead it was the economic policies pursued by
European leaders such as West Germany's Ludwig Erhard and Italy's
Luigi Einaudi that had the greatest impact on economic development in
the region. Similarly, in Eastern Europe, the growth of market
institutions will depend primarily on enacting the right economic
policies, not foreign assistance.

<P>
TRADE AND INVESTMENT, RATHER THAN AID
<P>
      Rather than pouring billions of dollars in government-to-
government aid into Eastern Europe and the republics, the West better
could promote economic development by taking steps to increase trade
and investment. The new democracies are critically short of the hard
currency needed to buy the machinery and Western high technology to
modernize their economies. Increased investment will bring private
capital to the region, and along with it the advanced technology and
managerial expertise required for economic expansion. Reducing Western
trade barriers will open markets for East European goods, thereby
encouraging the growth of agriculture, private industry, and services.
This in turn will lead to economic expansion and integration into the
world economy. 
<P>
      Western trade barriers remain a major impediment to expanding
trade. A 1989 Agency for International Development study on foreign
aid and economic development finds that Western trade protection
reduces the national income of developing countries by an amount equal
to twice the total aid sent annually from the developed to the
developing world. (Development and the National Interest: U.S.
Economic Assistance into the 21st Century (Washington, D.C.: United
States Agency for International Development, February 1989).
Hereinafter referred to as the Woods Report.) This costs the
developing world between 2.5 percent and 9 percent of its total
economic output and depresses developing country exports by over 10
percent. (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
"Protectionism and Structural Adjustment, Introduction and Part I,"
Geneva: January 1986.) 
<P>
      Free trade, of course, is a two-way street. It is equally
important that Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics reduce
their own trade barriers to enjoy the benefits of freer trade,
including steady growth. High tariffs and such non-tariff barriers as
quotas and licensing fees impede economic development. They hurt Third
World consumers, who then must pay more for foreign goods. 
<P>
      Higher Prices. Also hurt are Third World domestic businesses,
which are forced to pay higher prices for imported supplies and raw
materials. This makes them less competitive on international markets,
decreasing exports. Trade barriers also reduce foreign investment,
since fewer world-class business opportunities exist in slow-growing
economies geared toward domestic markets. 
<P>
      The evidence now is indisputable that outward-oriented, free
trade countries have higher economic growth rates than protectionist
countries. A comprehensive 1987 World Bank study concludes that gross
domestic product (GDP), manufacturing, and investment all grow faster
in trade-oriented than in protectionist countries. (World Bank, World
Development Report 1987 (Washington, D.C.: Oxford University Press,
1987).) 
<P>
      Many East Europeans resist speedy trade liberalization because
they erroneously believe that removing trade barriers will destroy
local industries, create unemployment, lower government revenues, and
lead to balance of payment deficits. 
<P>
      These concerns are contradicted by the empirical evidence. A
World Bank study of nineteen countries, released in fall 1990, shows
that the unemployment costs of broad trade liberalization are low and
temporary, and are offset by increases in economic growth. (World
Bank, Liberalising Foreign Trade in Developing Countries: The Lessons
of Experience, Washington, D.C.: October 1990.) According to the
study, moreover, lower tariffs actually can generate higher government
revenues because taxable imports increase. This rarely results in
serious balance of payment deterioration, since exports also rise
quickly.
<P>
      Just as important as increased trade is increased Western
investment. American and other Western firms can supply Eastern Europe
with the capital needed to modernize their economies and gain access
to new technology, entrepreneurial skills, managerial and marketing
expertise, and jobs with higher wages. In contrast to government-to-
government loans, a squandered investment by a multinational firm will
be that firm's loss only; it will not be a loss for America's
taxpayers.
<P>
      In most of the less developed world, multinational corporations
have been the most effective agents for economic development. Unlike
government or international organization bureaucrats, businessmen must
measure success or failure by a "bottom line," and tend therefore to
invest their money far more carefully. When Western businesses go
abroad, they bring with them the business, managerial, and job
training skills that developing countries must adopt in order to
compete on the world market. This already is happening in Eastern
Europe where such American multinationals as International Business
Machines, Incorporated, and General Electric Company have established
extensive job and technology training programs. 

<P>
THE ASIAN MODEL
<P>
      The rapid development of East Asia's four "tigers" -- Hong Kong,
the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore
-- demonstrates the key role played by free trade and Western
investment in economic growth. In the 1950s, the Pacific Rim was as
poor as Africa, and America was pouring massive foreign aid into South
Korea and Taiwan. Today, the Pacific Rim is approaching the living
standards of Western Europe while Africa remains impoverished. One
reason: the Asian Tigers kicked the foreign aid habit while Africa
remains addicted. 
<P>
      American aid in the 1950s allowed Seoul and Taipei to pursue
protectionist trade policies, imposing high tariffs and quotas in the
knowledge that U.S. aid would cushion their economies from some of
protectionism's worst effects. The same rationale led to heavy
subsidies for domestic producers. The combination of trade barriers
and subsidies made goods more expensive for consumers, hurt exports,
and slowed economic growth. It appeared to many economists at the time
that Africa in fact, with its abundant natural resources, had a much
better chance for rapid economic development than resource-poor, slow-
growing East Asia. (Edward L. Hudgins and Bryan T. Johnson, "Why Asia
Grows and Africa Doesn't," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 756,
March 2, 1990.)
<P>
      In the early 1960s, however, the U.S. inadvertently did Taiwan
and South Korea a favor by slashing foreign economic aid to them.
Though political factors prompted the aid cutoff, the consequences
were mainly economic. Seoul and Taipei dealt with reduced aid flows
from the U.S. by removing many government controls from the economy.
Trade was liberalized and subsidies were cut. (Alvin Rabushka, "Tax
Policy and Economic Growth in Advanced Developing Nations," report
prepared for the U.S. Agency for International Development, 1987, p.
344.) Ever since, Seoul and Taipei steadily have lowered trade
barriers, in part to keep pace with Hong Kong and Singapore, whose
open trade policies and unfettered economies have been magnets for
Western trade and investment. (In South Korea, 95 percent of import
licensing arrangements have been eliminated.) 
<P>
      Export Explosion. The result has been an export explosion for
the region. In the 1970s, exports grew an average of 20 percent a year
for Singapore; 31 percent a year for Taiwan; and 37 percent a year for
South Korea. (Peter L. Berger and Hsin-Huang Michael Hsiao, eds., In
Search of an East Asian Development Model (New Brunswick, N.J.:
Transaction Books, 1988), pp. 48-50.) This would not have been
possible without access to Western markets, particularly to the
American market. American consumers, for example, purchase 40 percent
of everything that Taiwan and South Korea export. 
<P>
      Trade and investment alone were not responsible for economic
development in East Asia. The Asian Tigers helped themselves
enormously with economic policies that included low taxes, minimal
government regulation, tight monetary policy, and realistic currency
exchange rates. Taken together, these policies have led to more rapid
economic growth than any other region in the world. In three decades,
per capita income in the Asian Tigers increased 266 percent. (Hudgins
and Johnson, op. cit., p. 4.) Already, East Asia is beginning to
overtake parts of Western Europe: the average Hong Kong citizen, for
example, today has greater purchasing power than the average Swede. 
<P>
      East Europeans have the resources and the educated and skilled
work force needed to mimic the success of the Asian Tigers. To do so,
they will need Western help in the form of open markets for East
European goods and increased investment.

<P>
ACCESS TO MARKETS: THE KEY TO EXPANDING TRADE 
<P>
      Given market access, East European countries and the Soviet
Union could double their share of world trade over the next two
decades, according to a study by economists Susan M. Collins and Dania
Rodrik. Their study predicts a drastic redirection of trade for East
European countries and the Soviet Union away from each other and
toward Western markets. (Collins and Rodrik, op. cit., Chapter 2.)
<P>
      As a percentage of their total exports, East European exports to
the West are expected to increase from a current range of between 9
percent (Bulgaria) and 34 percent (Poland), to between 40 percent and
62 percent. 
<P>
      Europe, rather than the U.S. or Japan, will account for the
overwhelming preponderance of this trade shift. If the EC opens its
markets to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, trade with the East
could rise from 4 percent of EC trade today to 25 percent within
twenty years. Soviet and East European trade is predicted to rise only
to between 6 percent and 9 percent of U.S. trade from its level of
just over 1 percent today. (Ibid. pp. 44-48.) 
<P>
      Trade figures for 1990 and early 1991 tend to confirm the
changing patterns predicted by Collins and Rodrik. Hungary, for
example, increased its hard currency trade -- mostly with the West --
by 18 percent in 1990 and 40 percent in the first quarter of this
year. Most of the increase was due to the boost in exports by newly
created small- and medium-sized Hungarian private companies, which are
proving their ability to react more quickly than giant state
industries to the collapse of Soviet trade and the decline of East
European markets. 
<P>
      Pleading Desperately. The problem is that it is far from certain
that the West, particularly West Europe, will open its markets to East
European products. EC trade barriers keep out products from the East
despite desperate pleas for trade liberalization from Vaclev Klaus,
Lech Walesa, and other East European leaders. Complains Rita Klimova,
Czechoslovakia's Ambassador to the U.S., "The EC is talking about
environmental cooperation and cultural exchanges, but on the issue of
trade, they're relegating it to the end of the century." (Wall Street
Journal, July 25, 1991.) 
<P>
      Due to inferior technology, most East European and Soviet
industrial, high-tech and consumer goods cannot compete in Western
markets. Ironically, and not accidentally, it is in precisely these
sectors that the European Community has eliminated most non-tariff
trade barriers, such as quotas. 
<P>
      By contrast, in sectors where East Europeans often enjoy a
comparative advantage due to cheaper labor costs, lower land values,
and other reasons -- including agriculture, clothing, steel, and
textiles -- the European Community has erected very high barriers. If
the market alone were the arbiter, according to David Roche, chief
strategist with Morgan Stanley Company in London, there would be a
major transfer of production from Western Europe to the East in these
sectors. 
<P>
      Most troubling surely is the EC's notorious Common Agriculture
Policy (CAP). An anti-competitive program managed by the EC's Brussels
bureaucracy, the CAP mandates high tariffs on agricultural goods
imported by the EC while providing export and production subsidies for
EC farmers' products. (For more information on the CAP, see Ewen M.
Wilson, "The European Community's Common Agricultural Policy:
Continued Problems for the U.S.," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
799, December 5, 1990.) If it were not for the CAP, several East
European countries, particularly Poland, and eventually Ukraine, could
be major agricultural exporters to the EC. 
<P>
      Dumping of Products. In addition to blocking agricultural
imports into Western Europe, CAP subsidies mean that EC agricultural
products are dumped onto East European markets at below-market prices,
hurting local production. This has caused tremendous political
problems for the East European governments. In summer 1991, for
instance, Czech farmers went on strike and blocked border crossings to
protest the import of subsidized EC food. 
<P>
      The European Community currently is nearing agreement with
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland to make these nations "associate
members" of the EC and to ease trade barriers. The association
agreements, however, at least in the short term, will keep many
barriers in place. EC quotas and duties on steel will be lifted within
five years and tariffs on textiles within ten years for the associate
members. Tariffs on meat will be somewhat lowered, but farm products
will continue to be heavily protected by the CAP. Germany still is
demanding import restrictions to keep out East European coal. 
<P>
      Too Long a Wait. East Europeans cannot wait five to ten years
for a partial opening of the West European market. The collapse of
trade with the Soviet Union and disintegrating intra-East European
trade make it imperative that markets for their goods open
immediately. Laments Vladimir Dlouhy, Czechoslovakia's economics
minister, "I don't need support [reducing trade barriers] in five
years. I need it now and terribly so." ("East Looks West and Sees
Trade Barriers," Wall Street Journal, July 25, 1991.) 
<P>
      One effect of the EC's refusal to eliminate trade barriers
quickly is that East European countries are likely to start raising
their own tariffs in response, reversing the welcome trend toward
trade liberalization. Hungary this year cut average tariff rates from
16 percent to 13 percent, bringing them more in line with other
developed countries. ("Hungarians allow most curbs on imports to
lapse," Financial Times, April 10, 1991.) License requirements for the
import of Western goods also have been cut by Hungary; they are now
required for only 10 percent of imports, and 99 percent of
applications were approved last year. 
<P>
      Poland, meanwhile, last year eliminated import quotas; most
duties were lowered to zero or five percent, and tariffs were removed
altogether on about 58 percent of goods coming into the country.
Partly as a result of the trade liberalization, Polish companies
bought cheap imported components and thus reduced costs. The result:
Polish businesses increased exports 50 percent last year. 
<P>
      Swinging Pendulum. But now the pendulum is swinging the other
way. This April, Poland raised the average customs tariff on
agricultural goods from 9.8 percent to 19.3 percent and duties on
finished tobacco products from 30 percent to 60 percent. 
<P>
      For its part, the U.S. has moved further and more quickly than
the EC to reduce barriers to East European exports. George Bush's
Trade Enhancement Initiative for Central and Eastern Europe, for
instance, grants duty-free benefits to some categories of East
European exports and funds seminars for East European officials on
U.S. trade laws. Further, in the past two years, Washington has
granted what is known as "Generalized System of Preferences" (GSP),
allowing $500 million in East European goods to be exported to the
U.S. free of duty charges. An additional $182 million in GSP benefits
for Eastern Europe were approved in March. ( Poland will receive $93.3
million of the benefits, thereby doubling Poland's duty-free exports.)

<P>
      While helpful, these measures are of limited assistance to East
European countries since by law they exclude the very sectors in which
the highest barriers already exist: cheese, clothing, steel, and
textiles. In July, Bush announced that special trade preferences would
be granted to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland in the food and
textile sectors. All former East bloc countries except Albania and
Romania now have been granted Most Favored Nation (MFN) status by the
U.S., meaning they all receive the benefits of the same low tariffs
extended to more than 150 countries. Steel quotas will be removed next
year and textile quotas have been eased, although political opposition
from textile states makes complete elimination of the quotas unlikely.
Meanwhile quotas on clothing, a major potential East European export,
remain intact.
<P>

FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASING SLOWLY IN EASTERN EUROPE
<P>
      Since communism collapsed in 1989, Eastern Europe has attracted
over $1.5 billion in Western private investment. PlanEcon, a
Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm, estimates that by 1993,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland combined could be getting $3.2
billion a year in foreign investment. (PlanEcon Report, various
issues, Washington, D.C.) After a very slow start, American companies
are beginning to invest greater amounts of capital in the region. 
<P>
      American firms overtook the Germans last year as the top
investors in Hungary. Over 4,500 joint American-Hungarian ventures
have been registered; American giants Ford Motor Company, General
Electric Company, General Motors Corporation, and Sara Lee Corporation
plan a combined $440 million in investments in Hungary. American
institutional investors, too, are putting money in Hungary. Americans
recently bought about half the $14.3 million shares available in a
stock offering of Fotex Corporation, a Hungarian conglomerate with a
chain of photo labs, eyeglass stores, and crystal shops. 
<P>
      U.S. business investment also is picking up in Poland. American
investors accounted for 11.3 percent of the new foreign businesses
registered there in 1990, twice the level of 1989. ("Situation
Report-Poland: January-February 1991," U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
International Division, p. 5.) Over 214 American firms, with
investments of over $58 million, now are registered in Poland. Still,
this is a relatively small share of the $400 million in foreign direct
investment that flowed into Poland in just the first quarter of 1990.
<P>
      Like Asian Tigers. If East Europeans and the Soviet republics
are to duplicate the rapid economic growth of the Asian Tigers, they
must attract far greater levels of private investment from America and
other Western countries. Important steps in this direction already
have been taken by the East Europeans themselves. Western companies
now are permitted by Hungary and Poland to take their profits out of
the country. Tax incentives and legal investment guarantees
increasingly are being offered to foreign businesses. Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, and Poland, for instance, all offer "tax holidays" to foreign
businesses. Most of the East European countries already, or soon will,
permit majority foreign ownership of newly privatized companies -- a
complete turnaround from the xenophobia of the communist era. 
<P>
      There remain, however, significant obstacles to doing business
even in Hungary and Poland. Telecommunications systems remain
unreliable and of poor quality. Modern banking systems are not yet in
place. Laws governing ownership and the transfer of property still are
confused, while most industries remain in state hands. Bureaucratic
obstacles abound and currencies are not yet fully convertible on
international markets. 
<P>
      East European Role. Responsibility for increasing foreign direct
private investment rests mainly with the East Europeans themselves. If
they continue their march toward free market economies, foreign
investment will follow. Still there is much that America and Western
Europe can do.
<P>
      The Bush Administration already has moved to increase American
investment in Eastern Europe. A Bilateral Investment Treaty still
under negotiation with Czechoslovakia, for instance, will give
American investors such basic guarantees as equal treatment with local
companies. It also will allow full "repatriation" of profits to the
U.S. A similar treaty is being negotiated with Bulgaria. Last year,
the U.S. Senate ratified a Business and Economic Relations Treaty with
Poland which, along with the guarantees of a Bilateral Investment
Treaty, also protects intellectual property rights, like patents. 

<P>
U.S. TAX LAWS BARRIER TO INVESTMENT 
<P>
      One serious remaining obstacle to American investment in Eastern
Europe is the U.S. tax code. For nearly the first half-century after
the adoption of the corporate income tax in 1913, American companies
paid lower taxes relative to other countries on income earned abroad.
In this period, as a result, American companies were highly
competitive globally. 
<P>
      Starting in the early 1960s, however, tax laws were made ever
more complicated, eroding the tax advantage American companies enjoyed
over other multinationals. The average effective tax rate on income
earned abroad for U.S. companies is 38 percent. This is higher than
the rate paid by companies based in any of the six other major
industrial countries. Over the past thirty years, Germany, the
Netherlands, and other Western countries have revised tax laws to
encourage their companies to compete internationally. America has
moved in the opposite direction. (See, for example, The Competitive
Burden: Tax Treatment of U.S. Multinationals, prepared for the Tax
Foundation by Arthur Young and Company, Washington, D.C., 1988; Norman
B. Ture, "EC92's Implications for U.S. Foreign Tax Policy, " testimony
to the House Committee on Ways and Means, January 30, 1990; and
Competitive Tax Disadvantages Faced by U.S. Multinationals, A Tax
Foundation Special Report, Washington D.C., 1990.)
<P>
      No Tax Holidays. One of the most anti-foreign-investment aspects
of the U.S. tax code is that it does not permit American companies to
take advantage of many incentives to attract investment offered by
foreign governments, including the East European. Among these are "tax
holidays," which exempt foreign multinationals from all local taxes
for periods of up to ten years; Poland automatically grants joint
ventures with foreign investors a three-year tax holiday.
<P>
      The U.S. tax code requires American companies operating abroad
to pay foreign taxes on corporate profits. Then, if the foreign tax is
lower than the U.S. corporate profits tax, the difference between the
two taxes must be paid to the U.S. Treasury. If the foreign tax rate
is cut, therefore, the company receives no benefit because it simply
pays more to U.S. tax collectors. Even if a foreign country's tax rate
drops to zero, as it does during a tax holiday, the effective tax rate
for the U.S. company is not lower. The firm simply pays the full
amount to the U.S. government. Other industrial nations allow for what
is called "tax sparing." By this, the governments "spare" or "forgive"
the right to levy their full tax on a company if it takes advantage of
a "tax holiday" or similar incentive. 
<P>
      Forbidding Tax Sparing. Tax sparing encourages firms to do
business overseas, thereby assisting in Third World economic
development and at the same time making Western businesses in those
countries that allow it more competitive and profitable. By forbidding
tax sparing, the U.S. undermines the competitiveness of Americans own
companies vis-a-vis other Western companies. 
<P>
      A study by the Washington-based Tax Foundation finds, for
example, that a German firm operating in Singapore would have a 24
percent advantage in cash flow over an American firm; a Japanese firm
would have a 32 percent advantage. The reason: tax sparing. Germany
and Japan have tax sparing agreements with Singapore; America does
not. ( Competitive Tax Disadvantages Faced by U.S. Multinationals, A
Tax Foundation Special Report, Washington D.C., 1990.)
<P>
      Income Tax Earned Abroad. Another example of how U.S. tax laws
discourage American companies from investing and operating abroad is
the individual income tax. The U.S. is the only major industrialized
country that taxes individual income earned abroad. As a result, West
Europeans or Japanese working in Eastern Europe pay only local income
taxes. Americans, by contrast, pay U.S. taxes in addition to local
taxes on incomes above $70,000. 
<P>
      This discourages higher-paid, senior American executives from
working in Eastern Europe and elsewhere in the developing world. This,
in turn, makes it more costly and more difficult for U.S. firms to
compete globally, thereby decreasing competitiveness and ultimately
investment. The tax burden imposed on Americans working abroad also
costs the U.S. exports. According to a 1980 Chase Econometrics study,
U.S. exports decline by 10 percent for every 10 percent reduction in
American workers overseas. (Robert D. Shriner, "Taxation of U.S.
Workers Overseas Hurts Workers, Firms and Exports," Chase
Econometrics, U.S. Macroeconomic Forecast and Analysis, May 1981, pp.
A30-A37.)
<P>

A FIVE-PLANK PROGRAM TO INCREASE TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH EASTERN
EUROPE AND THE REPUBLICS
<P>
      For Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics to succeed in
their transformation to free market economies, their trade with the
West and their ability to attract foreign investment must increase
dramatically. Yet, so far, doors to Western markets remain tough to
pry open, while foreign investment is limited. Sweeping initiatives
are needed by the U.S. and Western Europe to open markets to East
European goods and to clear the way for increased Western investment.
The U.S. already has made progress. Further steps will signal the East
Europeans and former Soviets that Americans, unlike many West
Europeans, have confidence in Eastern Europe's ability to transform
its economy. George Bush should help the East Europeans and former
Soviet republics to help themselves by unveiling a five-plank program
for promoting increased trade and investment in the region. The
program: 
<P>
Plank #1: Offer to negotiate free trade agreements between the U.S.
          and the East European countries, including the former
          Soviet republics.
<P>
      Just when the countries of Eastern Europe most need free trade,
they are being met with resistance, especially by the European
Community. An offer to negotiate a free trade area with the U.S. would
give East Europeans leverage against the EC by offering them an
alternative economic partner. It also would encourage American
investment in Eastern Europe and give East Europeans access to the
American market. It further would ensure that when East-West European
trade barriers finally are dropped in ten years, America would not be
isolated, stuck with high barriers to trade with both the EC and East
Europeans.
<P>
      Free trade arrangements (FTAs) with Eastern Europe and the
republics would remove obstacles to trade such as tariffs, as well as
nontariff trade barriers like import licensing, trade quotas, and
subsidies. There are other potential benefits that can and should be
negotiated in FTAs. Restrictions on foreign investments can be
eliminated, intellectual property agreements that protect American
companies' patents and copyrights can be strengthened, and trade
conflicts, such as those over anti-dumping laws, can be reconciled by
creating a trade dispute resolution process. The U.S. has FTAs with
Canada and Israel and is negotiating an FTA with Mexico. FTAs offer
more short-term advantages than the higher tariffs and barriers
offered by "association" status with the EC, and would benefit East
Europeans over the long term since they would force the EC to open its
own markets to compete on equal terms with America. 
<P>
Plank #2: Lower U.S. trade barriers for goods and services from
          Eastern Europe and the republics and exempt their exports
          from all tariffs.<P>
      Free trade negotiations with the East Europeans could take
several years, given their political complexities. Immediately,
however, the U.S. can move unilaterally to reduce trade barriers to
products from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. Barriers
should be removed, or lowered substantially, to the import of cheese,
clothing, steel, and textiles. These are some of the most heavily
protected U.S. markets, but also are the sectors in which Eastern
products have the best chance to compete in the American market. 
<P>
      The critical first step is to eliminate customs duties on
imported goods from Eastern Europe. The U.S. in the last two years
already has granted $682 million in "Generalized System of
Preferences," allowing East European goods to be imported into the
U.S. duty free. While helpful, these measures are of limited
assistance to East European countries since by law they exclude the
very sectors in which the highest barriers already exist, including
again, cheese, clothing, steel and textiles. 
<P>
      Bush announced at the July Western industrialized nations Group
of Seven (G-7) economic summit in London that Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland would be granted special trade preferences in the food and
textile sectors. Quotas are to be increased on textiles while more
agricultural goods are to be eligible for GSP preferences. Bush should
take this one step farther by calling for an East European Trade
Preference Act which eliminates duties on all goods from Eastern
Europe for five years. This would open a huge market for East European
exports, thereby encouraging the rapid development of dynamic private
sector businesses with exporting potential.
<P>
Plank #3: Withhold U.S. funding for the New European Bank for
          Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) until the European
          Community agrees to reduce significantly its trade barriers
          to East European products.
<P>
      Dismayed by the European barriers to trade with the East, voices
in Europe are calling for trade liberalization. Jrgen W. Mollemann,
the German Economics Minister, advocates the elimination of quotas on
East European goods and the elimination of subsidies for EC producers,
including farmers. In a speech to his cabinet, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on October 13 endorsed Molleman's proposals. Britain and
Denmark also have called for rapidly opening markets to Eastern
Europe. An EC Commission report released last month urges the EC to
increase access for East European goods to EC markets. Major
opposition, predictably, is coming from traditionally protectionist
France. As such, the EC is not taking the advice of its own experts.
(Wall Street Journal, July 30, 1991, p. A13.) The Bush Administration
too repeatedly has pressed the EC to reduce trade barriers to Eastern
Europe, but to little avail. The EC needs to be pushed harder. 
<P>
      Aid to Transition. One lever Washington holds for this is the
U.S. contribution to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD). The EBRD was created in early 1990 to assist the
East European transition to democracy and market economies. EC members
hold 51 percent of the shares in the bank, although the U.S. is the
largest individual country shareholder with 10 percent. Funds for the
bank are contributed by member countries proportionate with their
voting shares. This amounts to a $1.2 billion contribution from the
U.S. Of this, 30 percent, or $365 million, must be contributed in
cash, while the remainder would be "callable" when needed.
<P>
      Headed by French socialist Jacques Attali, the EBRD began
operations this fall, with $12.2 billion to aid Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union. One-quarter of the bank's budget will go to the 23 well-
paid, full-time directors of the Bank, largely bureaucrats and ex-
politicians. ("A bank in the hand," The Economist, April 13, 1991, pp.
14-15.) 
<P>
      Due to American insistence, 60 percent of EBRD loans will go to
Eastern Europe's growing private sector, rather than to governments.
Firms that produce textiles and process food should be prime
candidates for loans from the bank. These loans will do little good,
however, unless new businesses in Eastern Europe have access to EC
markets for their products. Bush and Congress should refuse to approve
of the scheduled American contribution to the European-controlled
development bank until Western Europe eliminates or greatly reduces
its trade barriers to East European products, including opening its
markets to Eastern agricultural goods. 
<P>
Plank #4: Allow for "tax sparing" with East European countries and
          former Soviet republics.
<P>
      East European countries, desperate for Western capital and know-
how, are granting generous tax holidays to foreign companies. The tax
laws of many developed countries allow their multinational
corporations to take advantage of tax holidays. In these cases, the
developed country spares the multinational firm the obligation of
paying higher taxes in its home country when their foreign taxes drop.
This is not so for American companies, which simply have to pay higher
U.S. taxes when their foreign taxes are lowered. This hurts the
American competitive position vis-a-vis other Western multinational
corporations. 
<P>
      Toward a Level Playing Field. Tax sparing for American
corporations, instituted in the form of treaties between the U.S. and
East European governments, would promote increased American investment
in Eastern Europe and level the playing field for American companies
in relation to other Western corporations. Representative David
Dreier, the California Republican, will introduce a bill this month
known as PROGRESS. It would authorize the President to allow for tax
sparing for U.S. companies operating in Eastern Europe. 
<P>
      If it approves tax sparing, Congress would expand opportunities
for U.S. businesses and increase U.S. direct investment in Eastern
Europe and former Soviet republics. Bush should join Dreier in calling
on Congress to change the formula in the U.S. tax code that deals with
the treatment of foreign source income to allow for tax sparing. 
<P>
      According to Stephen J. Entin, resident scholar at the Institute
for Research on the Economics of Taxation in Washington, D.C., tax
sparing will not affect the 1990 budget agreement between the White
House and Congress nor will it hurt the U.S. budget deficit. (Stephen
Entin, "Aid to East Bloc -- A Taxing Question," Wall Street Journal,
September 5, 1991.) The reason: U.S. businesses have not actually
invested a great deal of money in the region and it will likely take
some time to realize substantial profits. Therefore the Treasury
Department's estimates for tax revenues from profits in the region
should be near zero anyway.
<P>
      Much of the U.S. investment in Eastern Europe and profits that
would be produced from the investments would not take place without
the tax sparing incentive. Therefore, tax sparing would have no real
revenue cost under the revenue estimating rules employed for budget
projections and could be enacted without the tax increases or spending
reductions mandated in the restrictions of the 1990 Budget Act.
<P>
      According to a January Price Waterhouse study, the value of
international trade as a percentage of U.S. national income has
doubled over the past four decades. The share of U.S. corporate
earnings produced by foreign affiliates has tripled, now accounting
for 43 percent of the worldwide profits of American multinational
corporations. (U.S. International Tax Policy For A Global Economy,
prepared for National Chamber Foundation by Price Waterhouse,
Executive Summary, January 11, 1991, p. e-3.) With international trade
becoming increasingly vital to the health of American businesses, the
U.S. no longer can afford to pursue tax policies that put its
companies at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. 

<P>
Plank #5: Reduce taxes on Americans working in Eastern Europe and the
          republics.
<P>
      Alone among major industrial nations, the U.S. taxes its
citizens who work abroad. Americans who earn more than $70,000 must
pay U.S. taxes in addition to foreign taxes. The resulting heavy tax
burden discourages individuals making more than $70,000 per year,
mainly high-level U.S. business executives with precisely the skills
needed in Eastern Europe, from spending much time working there. 
<P>
      The U.S. should be encouraging American firms to operate in
Eastern Europe, not discouraging them with high taxes. 
<P>
      Dreier's PROGRESS bill proposes doubling to $140,000 the amount
of foreign source income that can be exempted from U.S. personal
income taxes. This would offer powerful incentives for senior,
experienced American businessman to spend more time in Eastern Europe,
where opportunities for entrepreneurship and investment abound, and
where their managerial expertise and skills in finance and business
would be extraordinarily valuable in assisting local businesses to
adapt to free market conditions. 
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
      After decades of isolation, East Europeans and the peoples of
the dying Soviet Union want to develop free market economies and join
the world economy. Experience in the developing world demonstrates
that foreign aid is the wrong prescription both for economic growth
and expanding trade. Instead, as demonstrated in Africa, foreign aid
breeds a destructive cycle of dependency and ever increasing need. 
<P>
      The remarkable rise of the Asian Tigers -- Hong Kong, the
Republic of China on Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore --
offers a lesson for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics:
rapid growth in exports and large infusions of foreign business
investment are far more important than government-to-government aid in
sparking rapid growth.
<P>
      At the London economic summit in July, the leading industrial
countries endorsed this prescription, formally declaring that
"expanding markets for [Eastern Europe's] exports is vital." Yet,
despite the rhetoric, there are few signs that Western trade barriers
to East European goods soon will fall. Increases in energy prices and
the collapse of Soviet and intra-East European trade have created a
dire economic situation in Eastern Europe and the republics of the
former Soviet Union. The situation requires the U.S. and other
industrialized nations to match their rhetoric with action. U.S policy
should promote free trade, free markets, and increased Western
investment in the East. 
<P>
      Lowering Barriers. A first step should be for the U.S. to offer
free trade agreements to East European countries and former Soviet
republics. In the meantime, trade barriers should be lowered and East
European and republic goods should be let into America free of duty
charges for five years. The U.S. also should press the European
Community to reduce its own stiff trade barriers to Eastern Europe.
One way would be to withhold funding from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) until the EC opens its market to
East European agriculture, steel, textiles, and other "sensitive"
goods.
<P>
      To increase American business investment in Eastern Europe and
the republics, the U.S. should negotiate tax sparing treaties with
East European countries and liberated republics, and reduce taxes on
Americans working in the region. 
<P>
      The countries of Eastern Europe deserve to follow the high-
growth path of the Asian Tigers and reach the levels of prosperity
enjoyed in Western Europe. Toward this end, these countries are
adopting free market reforms such as freeing prices, tightening the
money supply, eliminating subsidies to state enterprises, and
privatizing and deregulating industry. Even with these reforms,
however, the East could fail unless the West opens its markets and
takes steps to encourage private investment in the East. It now,
therefore, is the time for America and the rest of the industrialized
world to assist them in their bid for prosperity and independence by
helping East Europeans to help themselves.

INTRODUCTION


<P> The White House is wrestling with America's "wetlands" policy.
This is because the federal government has been coming under heavy
criticism for abusing its powers to declare private property a
"wetland" and then to restrict how owners use their land. This
criticism and the broad confusion over wetlands policy, and even over
the definition of "wetlands," has prompted the President's cabinet-
level Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Dan
Quayle, to examine and plan revisions of the federal government's
"Wetlands Delineation Manual." ( Federal Manual for Identifying and
Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (1989).) This manual sets criteria
for use by all Executive Branch agencies and departments in
determining what is a wetland. In addition, the White House Domestic
Policy Council is conducting a broad overview of wetlands policy in
general.
<P> Checking Regulators. The Competitiveness Council's revisions are
to be completed by month's end and then released for public comment
before taking effect. If they are to contribute to government's dual
task of preserving ecological integrity and creating an environment
that spurs economic growth, then the Council's revisions must check
the impulses of regulators to declare even dry pieces of land to be
wetlands and place them under government jurisdiction. Too often such
action restricts the rights of owners without any compensation.

<P> Imprecise Definition. There are two problems with the federal
government's current policy toward wetlands. First, the definition of
a "wetland" is very imprecise, allowing many plots of essentially dry
land to be classified as "wet." Under this definition, for example,
even if a plot of land is dry for 358 of the 365 days in a year, it
still can be a target of government regulators.

<P> Second, because the definition of wetlands is imprecise, the
federal government has expanded the use of the "wetlands" designation
beyond what law originally intended. This law, the Clean Water Act of
1977, correctly seeks to limit discharges of pollutants into the
nation's waterways. Under the law, the federal government can regulate
pollutants dumped into wetlands if there is a danger that the
pollutants will seep into other nearby bodies of water, like lakes,
rivers, or other wetlands.

<P> The Clean Water Act is the principal instrument of America's
wetlands policy, with the focus exclusively on stopping pollution. Yet
over the years, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental
Protection Agency steadily have expanded their jurisdiction, using the
Clean Water Act as a means to protect wetlands and the flora and fauna
that depend on them for their own sake. In effect, the Clean Water Act
has been transformed into a "Wetlands Protection Act." Yet Congress
has never passed such a law. If the wetlands merit protection as
wetlands and if Congress and the Bush Administration want to protect
wetlands as such and the wildlife that use them, they should debate
the issue on its own merits and draw up laws tailored specifically to
that task. The federal government should not use the Clean Water Act
to do a job for which it was not originally designed.

<P> Attacking Private Property. The definition of a wetland might
seem like an obscure and unimportant detail buried harmlessly in
mountains of government regulations. In fact, the use of the current
definition by the federal government could affect most landowners in
the country, depriving them of the use of their property without
compensation. Under this law, for example, a Colorado farmer was
indicted for redirecting a river, which had been diverted onto his
land, back into its original bed. Under this law, too, a Pennsylvania
man was jailed for cleaning up tires in his backyard and hauling in
clean fill dirt, considered a pollutant, to level his land in
preparation for building a garage. The federal government threatened a
Pennsylvania couple with legal action for installing a tennis court on
their property on the grounds of polluting the water. A woman in
Wyoming was denied a permit to plant roses on her land. These are but
a few of thousands of similar cases of federal regulators moving
against private property in the name of preventing pollution or
protecting wetlands where no threat or where no wetland existed.

<P> The Council on Competitiveness can head off such abuses in the
future and bring balance to the treatment of wetlands by advising the
President to tighten the definition of a wetland. To restore the
original purpose of the Clean Water Act, that is, to prevent pollution
from spreading from one body of water to another, the revised wetlands
Delineation Manual should exclude the "wetlands" designation to any
tract if:
<P>
1)  it is not located close enough to another "water of the United
    States" for natural water flows to carry pollutants from the
    wetland into another such water, or 
<P>
2)  the physical nature of the wetland makes it generally impossible
    for pollutants to be carried out of the wetland via normal water
    flows.
<P>
This change would restore and confine the Clean Water Act to its
original status as an anti-pollution statute. If the government
specifically wishes to protect wetlands and wildlife, specific
statutes should deal with them.

<P> Such proposed charges surely will be resisted by many officials
in the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection
Agency, who will protest a redefinition that restricts their power to
use the Clean Water Act to protect wetlands simply because they are
wetlands. Even if such far-reaching changes are not politically
feasible at this time, at a minimum, the Council should try to tighten
the definition of what land actually qualifies as "wet." The new
definition should:
<UL>
Raise the minimum soil inundation and saturation requirements.

<P> Limit the list of plants used as indicators of whether an area is
    a wetland to those that grow exclusively in such an environment.

    <P>Require designated wetlands to meet all three traditional wetland
    identification criteria: degree of saturation, type of
    vegetation, and type of soil.

    <P>Place the burden of proof on the government to prove that an area
    in fact is a wetland covered by the Clean Water Act when a
    property owner is charged with polluting a wetland.

    <P>Drop the ambiguous "Difficult-to-Identify" category for wetlands.

    <P>Reevaluate all land currently designated as a wetland in
    accordance with the criteria of the new manual.
</UL>
<P> Comprehensive Review. The Domestic Policy Council, another
cabinet-level group, meanwhile is comprehensively reevaluating how to
deal with those areas determined to be wetlands. If the government's
purpose is to preserve wetlands or wildlife, then instead of using the
Clean Water Act to deny landowners permits for the use of their land,
the government either should purchase the land or pay the owners to
conserve it as a wetland. A principal purpose of government is to
protect private property. The federal government can perform this task
and deal with legitimate environmental concerns as well by defining
wetlands in a reasonable manner and using the Clean Water Act for its
original purpose of preventing pollution of the nation's waterways.

<P>
FROM CLEAN WATER STATUTE TO A NATIONAL ZONING LAW

<P> In 1965, Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
to limit water pollution. The Act was amended in 1972 and again in
1977, when it was renamed the Clean Water Act. The Act makes the
"discharge" of any "pollutant" from any "point source" into any
"waters of the United States" illegal unless the person responsible
has obtained a permit from the Secretary of the Army through the Army
Corps of Engineers. Rather than spell out what substances were deemed
harmful, Congress deliberately defined "pollutant" broadly, allowing
the Corps of Engineers to assess the threat to water quality posed by
any given pollutant in any given waterway case-by-case. The Corps may
grant or deny permits, or attach various conditions. A decision to
grant a permit is subject to veto by the EPA.

<P> The Act was amended in 1972 to cover all "waters of the United
States," which include all interstate waterways as well as all bodies
of water that drain into other waters that can carry pollutants across
a state or national boundary.

<P> Originally the Army Corps of Engineers did not apply the Clean
Water Act to wetlands, usually defined as "marshes, bogs, swamps, mud
flats, prairie potholes, and other forms of land flooded or saturated
by water." (   Richard Miniter, "Muddy Waters:  The Quagmire of
Wetlands Regulation," Policy Review No.  56 (Spring 1991), p.  70. 
See also William A.  Niering, The Audubon Society Nature Guides: 
Wetlands (New York:  Alfred A.  Knopf, Inc., 1988), pp.  18-134.) In
1975, however, a federal district court ordered the Clean Water Act to
be applied to wetlands. (   Natural Resources Defense Council v. 
Callaway, 392 F.  Supp.  685 (D.D.C.  1975).) The rationale was that
pollutants discharged into a wetland might be carried out of the
wetland and into an adjacent body of water by natural water flows, and
from there be carried downstream and eventually across a state line.
To the extent that there is an actual physical water connection
between a wetland and another water body (itself perhaps a wetland)
that is capable of carrying pollutants, then this wetland is plausibly
a "water of the United States" as defined in the Clean Water Act in
1972. Many wetlands, however, do not fit this definition.

<P> Broad Definition. To make matters more confusing, the Army Corps
of Engineers has defined "waters of the United States" to include "All
waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be
susceptible [in the future] to use in interstate or foreign
commerce.... " (   33 C.F.R.  328.3(a)(1).) The Corps has used this
definition to extend even further the jurisdiction of the Clean Water
Act. For example, a wetland becomes a "water of the United States"
simply if it can be used for recreational purposes by interstate or
foreign travelers. In litigation, the Corps and the EPA have argued
that a wetland can be a "water of the United States" for purposes of
the Clean Water Act if it actually or potentially can be used by
migratory waterfowl that may have crossed a state or national boundary
while traveling to or from the wetland.

<P>
A NATIONWIDE WETLAND

<P> The expansive interpretation of the Clean Water Act and the
phrase "waters of the United States" has meant that areas of little or
no ecological value are classified as "wetlands." This subjects these
areas to the permit requirements of the Clean Water Act. By one
estimate, 104 million acres, or 5 percent of all land in the lower 48
states, is now officially classified as wetland. (   Betsy Carpenter,
"In a murky quagmire," U.S.  News & World Report, June 3, 1991, p. 
45.) The Soil Conservation Service estimates that, under the current
definition, as many as 70 million acres of existing farmland could be
considered wetlands subject to federal control. (   Rick Henderson,
"The Swamp Thing," Reason, April 1991, pp.  32-33.) According to
economist Warren Brookes, the federal government's jurisdiction under
the Clean Water Act, as defined by the regulators, now encompasses "at
least half of all farmland, and as much as 60 percent of U.S. total
land area." (   Warren Brookes, "Swamping the economy?"  The
Washington Times, April 11, 1991, p.  63.) According to other
estimates, most of the eastern United States and 40 percent or more of
California may fit the current Delineation Manual's definition of
wetlands. (   Henderson, op.  cit., pp.  32 - 33.) Approximately 75
percent of the usable land in Alaska, that which is neither a mountain
nor a glacier, is classified as wetland, by definition, because for
much of the year the ground is frozen and water is locked underneath
the surface. (   Miniter, op.  cit.  p.  73.)

<P>
THE CURRENT WETLANDS QUAGMIRE

<P> Expansive interpretation of the Clean Water Act by federal
regulators has denied Americans the legitimate use of their property.
Example: A self-employed truck mechanic in Morrisville, Pennsylvania,
John Pozsgai, was sentenced to three years in prison and fined
$202,000 for removing old tires and rusting car parts from his land,
and then hauling in clean fill dirt to level the property in
preparation for building a garage. The trouble, Pozsgai was told, was
that he did not first obtain a permit from the Army Corps of
Engineers. This permit was necessary because, in the eyes of the
federal government, by cleaning up his land Pozsgai ostensibly was
discharging pollutants into a water of the U.S. Under the definitions
used by the Corps of Engineers and the EPA, the clean fill dirt
constituted a "pollutant," and his land constituted a "water of the
United States."
<P>
Example:      A corn farmer in Missouri, Rick McGown, is being
prosecuted for repairing a sunken levee on his property, thereby
restoring 150 acres of brushland to cropland, on which corn is now
planted. For McGown, the problem was his failure to obtain a Corps of
Engineers permit. The Corps considers his cornfield a wetland, and
thus a "water of the United States," because a Corps official claimed
to have found cattails, a kind of marsh plant, growing on the land.
However, what the official thought was cattail was actually sorghum, a
plant that may look like a cattail but which grows on dry land. The
sorghum, moreover, had been planted by McGown. Like Pozsgai in
Pennsylvania, McGown is charged with illegally polluting the water. 

<P>Example:      In Juneau, Alaska, plans to expand a private shelter
for the homeless were held up recently for over a year because the
land underneath the shelter was declared to be a wetland, thus making
a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers necessary before the
addition could be built. It made no difference that the plot of land
was in the middle of a city block. 

<P>Example:      In Maryland and California, federal wetlands
regulations have blocked the construction of low-income housing
projects.

<P>Example:      A young couple in Pennsylvania recently was threatened
with suit by federal authorities for installing a tennis court in
their yard. The charge: polluting the water.

<P>Example:      An elderly woman in Wyoming was prohibited from
planting a bed of roses on her land, again in the name of enforcing
the Clean Water Act.

<P>Example:      Around the country, farmers have been warned that their
land is a federally protected wetland, and hence that they absolutely
must not plow it or plant crops on it unless they first obtain a
permit.

<P> These and countless similar incidents (   For documentation of
these and other incidents, see Miniter, op.  cit.; Henderson, op. 
cit.; Rick Raber, "Wetlands statutes bog down residents," The Times of
Trenton, February 3, 1991, p.  B7.  See also Carpenter, op.  cit..)
have two things in common: 1) The land involved is basically dry, or
only marginally wet at most, making its characterization as a "water
of the United States" highly dubious; and 2) the "pollutants"
allegedly being "discharged" into these putative "waters of the United
States," and the activities for which a permit is being required,
almost always pose not even a remote threat to water quality.

<P> For the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA to move against such
lands, therefore, amounts to these agencies making zoning or land-use
decisions under the guise of enforcing the Clean Water Act. 

<P> Usurpation of Authority. The Corps of Engineers and the EPA have
been using the Clean Water Act as a de facto Wetlands and Wildlife
Protection Act -- even though no such legislation exists. ( Although
the Clean Water Act has never been amended by Congress to make it a
Wetlands Preservation and Wildlife Protection Act, Congress has
enacted a wholly separate statute that specifically addresses these
subjects:  the "Water Bank Program for Wetlands Preservation,"
codified in Chapter 29 of Title 16 (Conservation) of the United States
Code.  The Water Bank Program authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture
to negotiate with landowners and to pay them a fee to keep their land
in its natural condition.) Anytime the agencies feel that a particular
parcel of land may be beneficial to wildlife, they arbitrarily apply
the wetlands definition to the parcel to prohibit the owner from using
the land.

<P> This usurpation and abuse of authority by federal regulators
affects all Americans, not just those who own land. Federal wetlands
regulations reduce the availability of land for housing and thus raise
the costs of all housing, including rental units. Requiring a
contractor and developer to obtain a Corps of Engineers or EPA permit
delays construction of state and federal housing projects and thus
raises their costs to taxpayers and eventual tenants. (   See, e.g.,
Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, "Not
In My Back Yard":  Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing (July 8,
1991); Jack Kemp, "Free Housing from Environmental Snobs," The Wall
Street Journal, July 8, 1991, p.  A6; Brookes, op.  cit.) Similarly,
food costs increase as the amount of land available for farming is
reduced and the costs of complying with bureaucratic red tape are
passed on to consumers.
<P>
POLLUTION PREVENTION OR ARBITRARY ECOLOGY?

<P> The Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Quayle,
has the responsibility for reviewing federal regulations to determine
whether laws are being enforced in the most efficient and least costly
manner. At the highest level the Council consists of the Secretary of
the Treasury, Nicholas Brady, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh,
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget, Richard Darman, the Chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisors, Michael Boskin, and the Chief of Staff to the
President, John Sununu. Other cabinet members are invited to
participate when the Council deals with issues affecting their
agencies. The Executive Director of the Council is Allan Hubbard. 

<P> The Council now is reviewing the definition of "wetland" as used
in the Wetlands Delineation Manual. By this review, the Council has
the opportunity to restore fairness and balance to the definition of
wetlands, and to end abuses of the Clean Water Act.

<P> Many of the problems result from the attempt to use the Clean
Water Act not for the purpose of dealing with pollution but as a means
to preserve wetlands and wildlife for ecological reasons. To restore
the Clean Water Act to its original purpose, it is necessary to define
"wetland" in the context of preventing pollution. By this definition,
a plot of land is not a wetland covered by the Clean Water Act if:
<UL>
    it is not located close enough to another "water of the United
    States" for natural water flows to carry pollutants from the
    wetland into the other such water; or 
<P>
    the physical nature of the wetland makes it generally impossible
    for pollutants to be carried out of the wetland via normal water
    flows.
</UL>
<P> Such a redefinition would allow the EPA to focus its attentions
and efforts on the original purpose of the Clean Water Act: to prevent
the spread of pollutants in America's lakes and rivers. If there is a
need for separate laws to protect wetlands and wildlife for their own
sake, the Administration and Congress should consider this issue on
its merits and develop guidelines and regulations appropriate to the
task. ( One possible option, of course, would be to expand one of the
existing programs that already deal with the protection of wetlands
and wildlife, such as the Water Bank Program for Wetlands Preservation
mentioned in note 11 above.)


PUTTING THE "WET" BACK IN WETLANDS

The Council on Competitiveness, however, may find it difficult to
adopt a definition of wetlands that focuses exclusively on pollution
prevention. This is because the EPA and other agencies will resist
changes that prevent them from continuing to use the Clean Water Act
for purposes in addition to pollution prevention. If Quayle and
Hubbard are unable to convince the full Council on Competitiveness to
restore the definition of wetlands to the original intent of the law
and if they are forced to accept some definition of wetlands that
transforms the Clean Water Act into a charter to preserve wetlands and
wildlife for their own sake, then Quayle and Hubbard should press the
Council on Competitiveness to revise the Delineation Manual so that at
least wetlands no longer means puddles in people's backyards or damp
vacant lots in the middle of cities. A revised definition of wetlands
at least should:
<P>
** Raise the minimum soil inundation and saturation requirements.

<P> The current version of the Delineation Manual allows an area to
be classified as a wetland if it is either inundated or saturated with
water for a mere seven days a year. This is an unreasonable
definition. For land to have significant ecological value as a
wetland, its soil must be saturated long enough for vegetation and
wildlife to adapt to the saturated conditions. Most types of wildlife
dependent on wetlands, such as amphibians or immature water fowl, need
more than 14 days to complete the water phase of their life cycle. The
minimum periods of inundation or saturation required for an area to be
classified as a wetland therefore should be around 30 consecutive
days. Critics of the current wetlands definition suggest at least 21
days. These days of inundation or saturation, moreover, should be
during the growing season. Inundation or saturation occurring outside
the growing season, which is the time when the aquatic phase of most
animals' and plants' lifecycle occurs, is of no use to such wildlife
and should not count in deciding whether an area is a wetland. 

<P> The Manual's new definition should require saturation at the
surface, in contrast to the current Manual's requiring merely that
saturation occur within 18 inches of ground surface. This change
apparently makes sense to the former head of the Corps wetland
regulatory office, Bernard Goode, who helped write the current
Delineation Manual. According to a recent article, Goode "suggests
basing the delineation of wetlands on one parameter: the presence of
enough surface water for a sufficient amount of time to support
typical wetland plants. To meet this criterion, the water table -- not
merely a random puddle -- must be at or above the surface for 30 days
during the growing season." (   Henderson, op.  cit., p.  35.  (The
quotation is Henderson's summary of Goode's suggestion.))
<P>
** Limit the list of plants used as indicators of whether an area is a
wetland to those that grow exclusively in such an environment.

<P> Often the inundation and saturation characteristics -- or
"hydrology" -- of an area are difficult to determine. As such, as
indicators of whether a plot is a wetland, federal regulators look at
the vegetation growing in the area. The EPA recognizes some 7,000
"indicator species" of plants: If any of them are present, EPA
presumes that the land is a wetland. A major problem with this long
EPA list of indicators is that it includes many "facultative" species
-- those that are equally adapted to wet or dry conditions. As a
result, federal regulators now can designate land as a wetland even if
the only plant species growing on it are all capable of growing in dry
conditions. Many areas designated as wetlands, therefore, from an
environmental perspective, are not wetlands at all. The list of plants
used to indicate whether a plot is a wetland should be confined to
species that can grow only in a wet environment.

** Require designated wetlands to meet all three traditional wetland
identification criteria.

<P> The EPA normally looks at three factors in determining whether to
classify an area as a wetland: the number of days per year that the
area is inundated or saturated with water; whether the area has at
least one of the 7,000 indicator species of plants growing on it; and
whether the area is composed of any kind of "hydric" soil, that is
"earth that is chemically changed by water, usually with a peat, muck,
or mineral base." (   Miniter, op.  cit.  See also Niering, op.  cit. 
) Typically, the EPA classifies an area as a wetland if any two of
these factors exist. This predictably increases substantially the
amount of land deemed wetlands. And this then substantially increases
the cost to the American public of complying with the Clean Water Act.
To reduce these compliance costs to a level commensurate with the
environmental benefits conferred, only areas that meet all three
wetland identification criteria should be designated as wetlands and
subject to permitting requirements.
<P>
** Place the burden of proof on the government to prove that an area
in fact is a wetland covered by the Clean Water Act when a property
owner is charged with polluting a wetland.

<P> When the government accuses a property owner of violating the
Clean Water Act, the courts have tended to accept the government's
determinations that an area is a wetland subject to the jurisdiction
of the Act, notwithstanding the fact that the burden of proof is
supposed to be on the government. As a practical matter, the property
owner must prove that his or her land is not wetland. The burden of
proof, however, in wetlands cases as in all others, always should be
on the government. The federal agencies should be required to prove
that the area in question is a "water of the United States," as
defined by the Clean Water Act, and that the owner is guilty of
polluting in violation of the Act.
<P>
** Reject the ambiguous "Difficult-to-Identify" category for wetlands.

<P> Some officials in the Bush Administration suggest that the new
Delineation Manual include a special section for "Difficult-to-
Identify Wetlands." They fear that without such a definition, some
wetlands might be overlooked. Yet no "Difficult-to-Identify" section
is necessary. If a "difficult-to-identify" area truly is a wetland, it
will be covered by the Manual's definition. Mainly what a "Difficult-
to-Identify Wetlands" category would do is preserve the very
ambiguities in the current Manual that are responsible for current
problems. Many plots of land now designated "wetlands" appear to have
been done so arbitrarily, because they are considered environmentally
valuable, even though they are not covered by the Clean Water Act. The
"Difficult-to-Identify" designation seems devised to allow such
classifications in the future.
<P>
** Reevaluate all land currently designated as a wetland in accordance
with the criteria of the new Manual.

<P> To remedy, in part, past abuses, and to apply the new regulations
fairly, all land should be presumed not to be wetland. The EPA then
should review every case to determine which property is a wetland for
the purposes of enforcing the Clean Water Act.

<P>
AN HONEST WETLANDS PROTECTION POLICY

<P> On a parallel track to the questions being considered by the
Council on Competitiveness, another cabinet-level group, the Domestic
Policy Council, is conducting a broad overview of general wetlands
policy. One of the questions the Council is considering is what to do
with an area after it is determined to be a wetland. Under the current
policy, the government denies owners the use of their land. This
raises a very important legal question. The Fifth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution guarantees that when the federal government takes
private property for public use, it must pay the owner just
compensation. This is the Constitution's so-called "takings clause."
When the Clean Water Act is used in the manner originally contemplated
by Congress, to prevent water pollution, no compensation is required.
The "takings clause" is not at issue. The government simply prevents
one landowner from dumping a pollutant into a body of water that might
flow on to someone else's property. A landowner does not have a right
to create a nuisance on his property if it damages the property of
another. 

<P> The situation is quite different when the government denies an
owner a permit to use this property for activities that do not
constitute pollution. Then the owner is being deprived of a legitimate
use of his or her land. The "takings clause" thus applies, and the
government is obligated to pay compensation. 

<P> Recognizing Landowners' Rights. The courts are beginning to
recognize that the "takings clause" is being violated by some wetland
permit practices of the Army Corp of Engineers and the EPA. Last year,
in the case of Florida Rock Industries v. United States, the U.S.
Claims Court held that a landowner who had been denied a permit under
the Clean Water Act for discharging "pollutants" that did not
adversely affect water quality into wetlands was entitled to just
compensation. (   Florida Rock Industries v.  United States, 21 Cl. 
Ct.  161 (July 23, 1990).  See also Loveladies Harbor, Inc.  v. 
United States, 21 Cl.  Ct.  153 (July 23, 1990).) The Claims Court
awarded the landowner over $1 million in damages, applying the well-
established doctrine of takings law "that the public at large, rather
than a single owner, must bear the burden of an exercise of state
power in the public interest." (   Florida Rock Industries v.  United
States, 21 Cl.  Ct.  161, quoting Agins v.  Tiburon, 447 U.S.  255,
260-61 (1980).) 

<P> This case sets a precedent. If the Corp of Engineers and the EPA
continue to use the Clean Water Act as a vehicle for preserving
wetlands, they probably face more court judgments requiring them to
pay just compensation to landowners whose property is, in effect,
taken for public use. If the government wants to set aside and
preserve ecologically valuable wetlands, it should take the legal and
just approach: it should pay for them. The government, for instance,
could purchase "conservation easements" by paying the owners not to
change the land. Or the government could purchase the land outright. ( 
 The federal government already does this, to a limited extent,
through programs such as the Water Bank Program for Wetlands
Preservation mentioned in note 11 above.  Thus, all that is really
necessary is to expand an existing program.)

<P> Conservation Easements. Some may complain that paying to preserve
valuable wetlands may be expensive. Yet there may be no choice. The
courts seem ready to require that compensation be paid to landowners
denied their property rights. There is, of course, another source of
funds besides taxes that could be used for wetlands purchases. The
federal government already owns between one-quarter and one-third of
all the land in the U.S. Some of this could be sold and the proceeds
used to purchase conservation easements on ecologically valuable
wetlands. (   Alternatively, as San Francisco attorney Mark Pollot has
suggested, the federal government could compensate landowners whose
land it wishes to preserve as wetlands by simply giving them
substitute land directly.  See Henderson, op.  cit., p.  35.) By doing
so, the government would be substituting high-priority lands for low-
priority lands in its overall land holdings. This would achieve George
Bush's goal of "no net loss of wetlands" in a manner consistent with
the equally important goal suggested by economist Warren Brookes: "no
net loss of private property."


CONCLUSION

 The Clean Water Act originally was designed to prevent pollutants
from flowing from one body of water to another. To this end, the
federal government could claim jurisdiction over wetlands that may be
a source of such pollutants. Over the years, however, regulators have
used the Act's open-ended terms for a purpose for which the Act was
not intended: to protect wetlands as such. The Clean Water Act is an
inappropriate and inefficient vehicle for this end. Because the goals
of a wetlands policy and the best means to implement it have never
been considered and debated publicly in a coherent manner by policy
makers, often there is little connection between the government's use
of the "wetlands" designation and any legitimate environmental goal.
Worse, under the guise of protecting wetlands, the federal government
arbitrarily deprives owners of the full use and enjoyment of their
land without compensation.

<P> Restoring A Balance. Protecting private property rights is a
principal purpose of government. Preventing a pollutant from being
dumped in a body of water or a wetland does not necessarily violate
property rights. Quite the contrary. Preventing a pollutant from
flowing from water on one person's property into water on another's
protects the property rights of the latter. It is when the government
arbitrarily limits an owner's use of his property without
compensation, as it often has in the name of protecting wetlands, that
it oversteps it purpose.

<P> The Bush Administration can restore a balance to the government's
wetlands policy by revising the Delineation Manual and can begin an
open public debate on the role of the federal government in protecting
wetlands for their own sake.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Mexico's economic revolution now has spread from the cities to
the countryside. As part of his comprehensive program to liberalize
and modernize the Mexican economy, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
earlier this year began a sweeping reform of Mexico's antiquated
agricultural sector. In so doing, he has reversed seven decades of
village socialism and has laid the foundation for a modern, market-
oriented agricultural system. Together with the integration of Mexico
into the world economy and the recent completion of the negotiations
for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), these
agricultural reforms promise to transform the Mexican countryside and
peasantry and bring prosperity to a population that has never known
it.
<P>The importance of these changes extends beyond their economic
impact. They are symbolic of the deeper changes underway in Mexico and
are unambiguous evidence that Mexico is shedding its socialist past
and creating a modern society. Although much of the focus of Salinas's
reform program has been on economics, his larger agenda embraces
social and political reform as well. His major objective is to
transform Mexico from a Third World country to a member of the
developed world. Accomplishing this means overturning the old social
and political order and remaking the country's identity.
   <P>  At the heart of the rural social order in Mexico is the ejido
system -- a quasi-socialist system of communal land tenure. Land
ownership has been a highly emotional issue throughout Mexico's
history, and the ejidos represent a bastion of Mexico's entrenched
economic, social, and political interests. Salinas's willingness to
tackle this stronghold of the political left in Mexico, and his
success in doing so, has demonstrated once again his mastery of
political timing and the widespread support he has assembled for his
program of reform. Only a few years ago, most observers would have
deemed his agricultural reforms impossible; now, however, the absence
of serious opposition is the clearest demonstration yet of the
economic and ideological bankruptcy of the old system and the broad
acceptance of the new.
   <P>  Although Mexico and the Mexican peasantry are the clear
beneficiaries of these reforms, the United States stands to gain as
well. An open and prosperous Mexican agricultural industry increases
U.S. export opportunities and also creates a source of low-cost
agricultural products for the U.S. domestic market. But the most
important benefit for the U.S. is that the reforms serve American
strategic interests. By advancing Mexico's prosperity, these reforms
of the countryside will contribute to the U.S. goal of promoting
Mexico's social and political stability. Few areas of the world will
have a greater importance for the U.S. over the next several decades
than Mexico, and that country's entry into the developed world is the
best way of ensuring that the interests of both countries are secured.
<P>
MEXICO'S AGRICULTURE SINCE THE REVOLUTION
  <P>   Although the latent wealth of Mexico's agricultural sector is
enormous, the countryside is in fact very backward. Operating far
below its potential -- much of it at the level of subsistence
farming -- Mexican agriculture has become a significant drain on the
larger economy. For example, although Mexico employs 26 percent of its
population in agricultural production, agriculture accounts for only 9
percent of the nation's gross domestic product. Equally serious are
the social and political consequences of rural underdevelopment, most
importantly the perpetuation of an impoverished peasantry and their
exclusion from a market economy.
  <P>   The problems of Mexican agriculture are largely man-made, the
result not of nature but of failed government policies. For over
seventy years, the government has extended its control over all
aspects of the countryside in an effort to create a socialist system
of agriculture. The results have been the same as with socialist
systems elsewhere: destruction of market incentives, pervasive
underdevelopment, squandering of resources, endemic poverty, and
corruption. 
<P>     In truth, the free market never has been allowed to operate in
Mexico's agricultural sector. The landed classes and the government
derived great power from their control over the countryside -- a power
they historically have been reluctant to give up.
 <P>   This legacy of controlling the countryside began in Mexico's
colonial era. The feudal system of land tenure that developed for the
majority of Mexicans after the Spanish conquest in 1521 resembled that
of black sharecroppers and tenant farmers in the American South
shortly after the Civil War. For nearly four centuries, most Mexican
peasants had no land of their own and instead worked on large estates,
with most of Mexico's land being controlled by a small group of
landowners. The peasantry lived in perpetual indebtedness to the
landowners, who used that indebtedness to tie their workers to the
land.
 <P>    This exploitative system, and the peasants' demand for land, were
among the most important causes of the Mexican Revolution of 1910-17.
In 1910, Porfirio Diaz, who had ruled Mexico for over three decades,
was overthrown by a group of revolutionary generals. Although control
of the country was bitterly contested over the next several years
between champions of the old order, radicals, and countless warlords,
the victors who emerged were heavily influenced by socialist ideology.
Among the most important was Emiliano Zapata, who had a strong
following among the landless peasants in the southern part of the
country. Zapata became the most vocal advocate for the redistribution
of land.
  <P>   In 1915, then-President Zapata passed through the Mexican
Congress the Agrarian Reform Act, which set the tone of Mexico's
agricultural policy for the next seven decades. The most important
feature of this legislation was a government commitment to
redistribute land to peasants. This was followed in 1917 by a new
constitution written by the revolutionary government that firmly
established the principle of land redistribution. Article 27 of the
Mexican Constitution conferred on each citizen a right to land and
obligated the government to provide it. This provision also gave the
government the right to confiscate unused or underutilized lands and
distribute them to Mexicans who petitioned the government for land.
The government also acquired extensive powers to regulate all aspects
of the countryside.
  <P>   In its redistribution program, the government rejected giving
land to individual farmers and instead established the ejido, or
communal farming system. The government divided land into plots that
were cultivated individually or collectively, but they were owned
communally by the ejido. Ownership of the land, however, remained in
the hands of the state. This communal or ejido definition of land was
written into the Constitution in 1917. The state saw private ownership
of land as "unsuited" to Mexico's agricultural traditions, and the
ejido was regarded as being more in line with the socialism favored by
the Mexican government at that time. Not incidentally, the ejido
system also provided the government with greater control over the
countryside and the peasantry. This control became a major instrument
of power for the ruling party -- the Partido Revolucionario
Institucional (PRI) -- which ruled over the peasantry through the
appointed administrators of the ejido system and the local patronage
they exercise.
 <P>    Once the country achieved stability after the long and bloody
years of the Revolution, conditions in the agricultural sector were
generally favorable. For twenty years following the Revolution, fallow
land once under the control of vast estates was cultivated as peasants
worked the newly formed ejidos. Between 1940 and 1960 agricultural
production in Mexico grew at an average rate of 4.6 percent, compared
with 2.7 percent for all Latin America. The principal cause of this
growth, however, was not an increase in the efficiency of production,
but the introduction of new harvesting and irrigation equipment and
high-yield, pest-resistant crops. Also, new lands were brought under
the plow as ejido farms were created and as private landowners
cultivated formerly fallow land, hoping thereby to avoid its
confiscation. (John Richard Heath and Gioia Palmieri, "Enhancing the
Contribution of the Land Reform Sector to Mexican Agricultural
Development," Agriculture Operations Division of the Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office, World Bank, Report # 8310-ME, March 30,
1990, p. 27.)
   <P>  Confiscations, however, continued, and an ever-increasing
percentage of land was brought under the ejido system. By 1988, half
of Mexico's arable land was controlled by the government through the
ejido system.

<P>
STATE INTERVENTION IMPOVERISHES THE MEXICAN COUNTRYSIDE
<P>    The growth of Mexican agriculture in these years, however, masked
major problems. Had ejido farms been as efficient as private ones,
Mexican agriculture would not have been harmed as the number of ejidos
grew and eventually dominated Mexican agriculture. The ejido system
worked against the emergence of modern, efficient farms and led
instead to the creation of very small farms of less than twelve acres.
Dedicated to subsistence farming, these small farms became
substantially isolated from the national and international economy. 
   <P>  Under Mexican law, the peasants grouped in an ejido could neither
sell nor rent the property; title remained in the hands of the
government. As a result, farmers had little incentive to invest in and
improve the land they worked. The lack of capital and market
incentives hampered modernization and mechanization. Government
control over all aspects of the agricultural system steadily
increased, from the regulation of prices to the establishment of
monopolies over purchasing and supply. In effect, the ejidos became
simple extensions of the economic and social planning bureaucracies in
Mexico City.
<P>
     When President Salinas took office in 1988, he inherited an
agricultural system in crisis. Despite strenuous efforts by the
government to fulfill its constitutional mandate to distribute land,
the promises of the revolution to the peasants had not been fulfilled.
Rural Mexico was now poorer than ever. Rural Mexican wages were one
third that of the average Mexican worker. The enormous resources of
the countryside were largely untapped and remained securely bound by
government control. Undercapitalized and underdeveloped, the Mexican
countryside in 1988 was little better than it was when Mexico won its
independence from Spain in 1821. 
<P>
POPULATION GROWTH HAMPERS LAND DISTRIBUTION
    <P> There were many sources of Mexico's agricultural problems, but an
important one was rapid population growth over the last fifty years.
Inefficient and underdeveloped, the state-owned and controlled
agricultural system failed to adapt to Mexico's population explosion.

   <P>  In 1917 Mexico had a population of only 13 million people.
Between 1915 to 1938, the government distributed 18.5 million acres to
the peasants, but this represented only six percent of Mexico's
farmland at that time, and it met most of the demands from Mexicans
for land. However, by 1940 Mexico's population had grown to 20
million. From 1938 to 1943 the government confiscated and distributed
an additional 44.5 million acres as the growing rural population
demanded more land. Thirty years later, the population had increased
155 percent to 51 million, (Alan Riding, Distant Neighbors: A Portrait
of the Mexicans (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1984), p. 220.)
creating tremendous pressures for further land confiscations and
redistributions. President Luis Echeverria Alvarez, who took office in
1970, expropriated 30 million acres from private farmers between 1970
and 1976, but only half of that was redistributed to peasants. The
rest either remained in the government's hands or was distributed to
wealthy Mexicans with political connections. By the time Echeverria
left office, ejido lands had jumped from one fourth to almost one half
of total agricultural lands. The next Mexican President, Jose Lopez
Portillo, seized 40 million additional acres, 16.5 million of which he
made into ejidos between 1976-1980. (Large confiscations occurred
during the administration of almost every Mexican President since the
revolution. By 1991 Mexico's Revolutionary Government had confiscated
246 million acres that were converted into ejido lands.) 
    <P> By 1988 Mexico had a population of 81 million, with 25 million
living in rural areas. When Salinas came to office in 1988, 3 million
petitions for land were on file. However, little unused arable land
remained to be confiscated. Over 70 million acres had been seized
during the previous twenty years alone, totalling over 246 million
acres since the revolution.

   <P>  Not only had the number of ejido farms increased dramatically,
but they had been subdivided numerous times, with a depressing effect
on income and productivity. Sixty percent of all arable land was in
ejido farms that averaged less than 11.5 acres, which is one-tenth the
size of the average U.S. farm. (Luis Tellez, "Imperativo de Cambio en
el Campo Mexicano," February 16, 1992, p. 3.)Ejido farmers working
these smaller plots received less than one sixth the salary of ejido
farmers working on plots larger than 18 acres. 
<P>
     Absence of Private Property Rights. A more serious problem than
the ejido's size was the absence of private property rights. Without
private ownership, ejido farmers had little incentive to improve the
land they worked. In addition, the Constitution's broad mandate
granting the government "caretaker" status of ejido lands prompted
Mexico City to adopt a paternalistic stance toward the ejido farmer.
Government control over all phases of agricultural production grew
steadily, embracing crop selection, planting time, fertilizers,
marketing, prices, and credit. Increasing government control meant
worsening results, especially in agriculture where decision-making
must be sensitive to daily, local, and individual conditions. In the
absence of a market economy, ejido farmers were grossly inefficient.
Private farmers in Mexico today are, on average, five times more
productive than their counterparts on the government-owned and
controlled ejidos. (Ibid, p. 4.)
<P>
     Article 27 of the Constitution prohibited ejido farmers from
mortgaging the land or using it as collateral for loans, making it
virtually impossible to obtain private credit. Ejido farmers were also
prevented from renting their land to others. These legal prohibitions
prevented farmers from developing their land. For instance, in spite
of advances in irrigation technologies, the amount of Mexican land
under irrigation has decreased dramatically over the last two decades.
Today only 14.8 million of Mexico's 234 million acres of agricultural
lands are irrigated. (Ibid, p. 3.)
  <P>   Between 1950 and 1965 agricultural production grew by 6.3 percent
annually, in spite of an increase in land cultivation by communal
farms. The reason: The introduction of new seed and fertilizer
technologies to Mexico. (Paul L. Yates, Mexico's Agricultural Dilemma
(Tucson, Arizona: University of Arizona Press, 1981), p. 19.) However,
the annual growth of agricultural production slowed to 2.9 percent
from 1966 to 1980 as more ejidos displaced private farmers. During the
1980s production ceased to grow at all and even began to decline,
falling 3.9 percent and 4.3 percent in 1988 and 1989, respectively. In
1990-1991 there was modest growth because of unseasonably good
rainfall, the government's withdrawal of farming subsidies, and
deregulation which forced farmers to use resources in more efficient
crop production.
   <P>  Besides suffering low productivity, Mexican agriculture is also a
tremendous drag on the rest of the economy. For example, agricultural
production represented 9 percent of Mexico's GDP in 1991, and yet it
absorbed 26 percent of the labor force. ("Profile of Mexican
Agriculture," U.S. Embassy, Mexico City, March 20, 1992, p. 2.)
According to the World Bank, 11 million of the 27 million rural
Mexicans live in extreme poverty, the principal cause being "lagging
rural and agricultural development." (Heath and Palmieri, op. cit., p.
35.)
    <P> These ill effects of Mexico's agricultural crisis are also
evident in the deterioration of the country's agricultural trade
balance. From 1960 to 1965 Mexico had an annual average agricultural
trade surplus equal to 2.3 percent of Mexico's GDP. By 1979 that
annual figure had fallen to only 0.7 percent of GDP. By 1989 Mexico's
agricultural surpluses had disappeared: from 1980 to 1989 Mexico had
an average annual agricultural trade deficit representing 0.3 percent
of GDP. During the 1980s Mexico was reduced to importing beans and
corn, which had been grown at home in sufficient quantities for
centuries.<P>
SALINAS REVOLUTIONIZES MEXICAN AGRICULTURE
<P>
     Salinas realized that Mexico could not fully modernize its
economy and provide a decent standard of living for its peasantry
unless it reformed its agricultural system radically. Dramatic steps
were needed to turn around a system that threatened to keep Mexico
permanently in the role of an underdeveloped country. 
  <P>   As a first step, after a year in office, Salinas began limited
reforms of the ejido system. For decades ejido farmers had "rented"
state-owned lands to private farmers, despite a constitutional
prohibition on such practices. "Rentismo," as the Mexicans called it,
had become widespread because it was one of the few ways the communal
farms could earn a living. Beginning in 1990, Salinas set up 79 pilot
projects to legalize ejido land rentals and also to attract capital
from the private sector. The first such program was started in May
1990 in the town of San Jose de Vacquerias in the northern state of
Nuevo Leon. The Vacquerias program was a joint business venture
between Gamesa Corporation, a Mexican food company owned by PepsiCo,
and a local ejido association.
 <P>    Under the agreement Gamesa contracted a purchase agreement with
the ejido association for wheat and agreed to invest $6 million in the
ejido for irrigation, seeds, fertilizers, and equipment; in return,
the ejido supplied the land and labor to grow the wheat. Since the
project began in 1990, Vacquerias has had two harvests per year
compared to annual harvests in previous years, and it has increased
output by 100 percent. The venture was so successful that investors
received a 29.6 percent return on their investment. A portion of these
profits was passed on to the workers in salaries three times the
amount stipulated in the contract between the workers and the
investors. Thereafter known as the "Vacquerias program," this model
has been copied in other regions of the country, most notably in the
Mexican states of Vera Cruz and Jalisco. (Roberto Salinas, "Ejido +
Private Sector," Business Mexico, July 1991, p. 27.)
<P>
     These and other free market reforms have been resisted by leftist
and nationalist forces who claim Salinas violated the Mexican
Constitution and undermined the Mexican Revolution's achievements in
the countryside. But far from undermining the peasantry, Salinas was
attempting to rescue it from the agricultural disaster caused by the
ejido system. (Tellez, op. cit., p. 4.) In his 1991 State of the
Nation address Salinas declared:
<P>
     <UL>The land distribution established more than fifty years ago . . .
     in its time brought justice to the countryside. But to attempt in
     the present circumstances to continue along the path then
     followed, no longer signifies prosperity for the country or
     justice for the campesinos. In the past, land distribution was a
     path of justice; today it is unproductive and impoverishing.
     (Carlos Salinas De Gortari, "Third State of the Nation Report,"
     (Presidencia de la Republica Direccion General de Comunicacion
     Social,1 November 1991), p. 69.) </UL>
<P>
     Constitutional Changes To Mexico's Agricultural System. Salinas
went on to announce sweeping reforms in Mexico's agricultural system.
In February 1992 the Mexican Congress adopted Salinas's free market
reform package for the Mexican countryside. In this Salinas proposed
to drastically reduce the government's role in agriculture, establish
private property rights, integrate the agricultural sector into the
larger market economy and thus bring it into the 20th century. 
<P>
     These changes included amending the Constitution to remove the
automatic "right" to land and the government's direct obligation to
provide it. The government also lost the power to expropriate lands it
deemed "unused or underused." In addition, the agency governing land
confiscations and distributions, the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform,
was reduced in size and much of its authority taken away. 
<P>
     Under the new law, individual ejido farmers will be given title
to their land. They also will be able to sell it, rent it to other
ejido associations or private corporations, use the land as collateral
for loans, and pass the land on to their heirs. Limits on acreage have
been relaxed. Formerly, individual ejido farmers were not allowed to
"own" more than 247 acres of irrigated land, 496 acres of non-
irrigated land, or 1,976 acres of forests. The new law allows the
creation of corporations or associations that legally can own 25 times
that limit: 6,175 irrigated acres, 12,350 nonirrigated acres, or
49,400 acres of forest. This will improve agricultural efficiency by
creating economies of scale where associations and corporations can
pool resources for credit and equipment purchases. 
<P>
     The prohibition on foreign ownership renting of farm land of any
type has also been removed. This is especially important for the
growth of agribusiness. The new legislation also establishes
independent tribunals that will adjudicate land disputes over
ownership rights to farmland. Formerly, the executive branch operated
as rule-maker, enforcer, and judge of land rights, creating a system
where corruption and abuse were common.
<P>
(Chart of different laws, now and then.) 
 <P>
     In addition to denying private property rights to farmers, the
old Article 27 gave the government extensive power over both private
and ejido land and the agricultural system in general. As a
consequence, the Mexican government created enormous government-owned
monopolies to supply Mexican farmers with credit, fertilizer, seeds,
irrigation equipment, and water. The government also became the
purchaser and marketer of food production, using price supports and
production requirements to regulate the market. The result was the
creation of a rigid system, guided more by political and bureaucratic
requirements than market forces. This system told farmers what to
grow, restricted the private sector from providing farmers with
necessary supplies and equipment, and effectively limited private-
sector financing.
<P>
     Realizing that private property rights were meaningless when
dominated by government monopolies, Salinas cut back the role of the
state. Most important, he reduced the power and budget of the state
food distribution monopoly CONASUPO. (CONASUPO stands for Compania
Nacional de Subsistencias Populares.) Formerly, CONASUPO set prices on
most food commodities and was the monopoly purchaser and distributor
for most foodstuffs. Today, CONASUPO supports artificial prices for
only two commodities: beans and corn, which are staples of the Mexican
diet. Similarly, the government's monopoly on fertilizer production
and distribution in Mexico was ended in 1991 with the privatization of
the state-owned fertilizer company, FERTIMEX. (FERTIMEX stands for
Fertilizantes Mexicanas.)
    <P> These reforms will have far-reaching effects on the agricultural
sector beyond the ejidos. In the past, extensive land confiscations
had a pernicious effect on private farmers, even on those whose land
was not seized. Since both small and large private property owners
could find their land taken at any time, Mexican land owners had
little incentive to improve their plots, never knowing when future
confiscations would wipe out their investment. (R.L. Barnes, "Proposed
Mexican Land Tenure Reform," Report #MX 1246, Agricultural Affairs
Office, U.S. Embassy, Mexico City, January 1992, p. 4.) The small
farmers were disproportionally affected because they had neither the
money nor the political connections to prevent their lands from being
confiscated. Now that the prospect of confiscations is gone, private
farmers will have greater incentives to invest in long-term production
and improvement of their lands. 
<P>
BENEFITS TO THE U.S. AND MEXICO UNDER AGRICULTURAL REFORMS
   <P>  Mexicans themselves will be the principal beneficiaries of
Salinas's reforms; the United States will benefit significantly, too.
Lower prices paid by U.S. consumers, opportunities for U.S.
businesses, reduced illegal immigration, and improved environmental
protection in Mexico -- as agribusiness industries use safer
pesticides and fertilizers -- will be among the long-term benefits of
these reforms.
<P>
     Advantages to U.S. Consumers and Businesses.As more fruits and
vegetables are grown more efficiently in Mexico, U.S. consumers will
have a wider variety of food products at lower costs. In the U.S.,
labor accounts for nearly 40 percent of the cost of the cultivation of
fruits and vegetables. (James A. Duffield and Lewell Gunter, "Will
Immigration Reform Affect the Economic Competitiveness of Labor-
Intensive Crops?" Agriculture and Rural Economy Division, U.S.
Department of Agriculture, May 1991, p. 7.) In 1987 those costs
amounted to $1.75 billion in such horticultural specialty products as
tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, $1.2 billion in melons and
vegetables, and $2.1 billion in fruit and nuts. Those costs, passed on
to the American consumer in higher prices, will be reduced as more of
this food is grown in Mexico. Although some Mexican food products,
such as tomatoes, compete directly with food producers in the U.S.,
Mexico's growing seasons for fruits and vegetables often occur in the
American "off-season" when domestically grown products are unavailable
or costly. Reduced costs on basic food items like fruits and
vegetables will most benefit poor Americans who, as a percentage of
their income, spend twice as much on food as the average American.
<P>
     U.S. businesses will benefit also from Salinas's agrarian reforms
and deregulation, which embrace not just the ejidos but the entire
food production and distribution system. Mexico has a population of 81
million, almost one third that of the U.S.-Mexican demand for food
products will grow 5 to 6 percent during the 1990s, almost double the
rate of Mexico's population growth. ("Profile of Mexican Agriculture,"
p. 6.) Mexico already represents a $21 billion market for U.S. food
producers, and as this grows new opportunities will open up for
American exporters. Already, Mexico's middle-class has developed a
growing appetite for U.S. food products. According to the U.S. Embassy
in Mexico, "Imports of products such as frozen foods and microwavable
foods have more than doubled in the last several years." ("Economic
Trends Report," (U.S. Embassy, Mexico City, August 1991, p. 50.) The
NAFTA will reduce tariffs and import restrictions on most U.S. food
products entering Mexico. Of even greater importance are the
agricultural reforms that will allow U.S. agricultural companies to
compete with formerly government-owned food distribution companies and
monopolies in Mexico, such as CONASUPO. FERTIMEX, the government
fertilizer monopoly, is being privatized, and foreign companies can
now sell fertilizers in Mexico. 
<P>
     The ejido reforms also have made it possible for U.S. companies
to expand their operations to Mexico, thereby helping them to stay
competitive in the global market. The flower industry is one example.
Joint ventures with Mexican companies are now helping U.S. flower
producers capture that part of the U.S. market that historically has
gone to European companies. ("Opportunities in the Mexican
Agricultural Sector," Mexican Secretary of Agriculture and Water
Resources, Subsecretary of Planning, 1991, p. 15.)
 <P>
     Several other projects now underway highlight the importance of
the growing strategic partnership between companies in the U.S. and
Mexico in the agribusiness sector. (Ibid., p. 29.) Companies involved
in U.S.-American agribusiness are:
<P>
**   Tropicana Foods, Inc. Tropicana, a U.S. company specializing in
fruit juice production and distribution, has begun two projects for
producing oranges, one privately owned and the other a joint venture
with ejido farmers. In this division of labor, the Mexican company
will be responsible for production and processing, while Tropicana
will market the orange juice both in Mexico and internationally.
<P>
**   Green Giant Corporation. Green Giant, a Mexican-based subsidiary
of Pillsbury Foods, Inc., processes and packages vegetables in the
state of Guanajuato in Mexico. Green Giant is involved in the entire
production process in Mexico from the production and package of
vegetables to their marketing and distribution. Its operations in
Mexico support exports to the U.S. and the rest of the world. 
<P>
**   PepsiCo, Inc. PepsiCo is involved in two projects in Mexico. One
is a joint venture with an ejido farm and the Mexican cookie and
cracker producer Gamesa. In this project PepsiCo is providing capital,
Gamesa the Mexican distribution network, and the ejidos the labor and
land. PepsiCo is using this project to further penetrate the growing
Mexican market. PepsiCo's other joint venture is with the Mexican
bread company Bimbo to produce corn and potato products for Bimbo's
line of products in Mexico. 
<P>
**   Grupo Trasgo. The Trasgo group is a consortium of Mexican
companies operating joint ventures with U.S. companies. Trasgo is
working with Tyson Foods Company, a U.S. based chicken producer, in
poultry growing and packaging. Fifty percent of the production in this
project is sold in the Japanese market. 
<P>
     As the ejido reforms place more Mexican land into productive
agriculture, the demand for farm machinery, irrigation equipment,
seeds, and fertilizer will grow dramatically. In these and other
areas, the U.S. is the supplier of choice. Last year the U.S. supplied
over 75 percent of Meico's imports of machinery and equipment,
including that used in agriculture. These exports are expected to
increase as food demand increases an estimated 5 to 6 percent during
the next ten years because rising incomes and population and the
positive effects of agricultural reforms.
<P>
     Stemming Illegal Immigration.The illegal immigration of Mexican
workers into the U.S. has long been a sensitive issue, clouding U.S.-
Mexico relations for decades. Last year U.S. immigration officials
caught over 1.1 million people trying to enter the U.S. illegally
across the U.S.-Mexico border, eighty-seven percent of which were
Mexicans. The U.S. Border Patrol estimates that only one in ten aliens
attempting to cross the border is caught.
<P>
     Most illegal immigrants from Mexico come from rural areas. Ejido
life has impoverished the Mexican farmer and made even subsistence
living difficult in many places. Many ejido farmers therefore migrate
to the U.S. in search of work. According to Antonio Hernandez,
director of a cooperative representing 2,850 ejidos in the Bajio
region of Mexico, 70 percent of his cooperative has at least one
family member working in the United States. (Dianna Solis,
"Agricultural Reform in Mexico Leaves Farmers Wanting, and Fearing,
Change," The Wall Street Journal, February 26, 1992, p. A4.) Salinas's
reforms will keep more Mexicans at home as they see the opportunities
now available at growing and harvesting their own crops.
<P>
     Promoting Environmental Protection. Mexico's legacy of government
intervention and public ownership of lands has led to destructive
behavior by Mexican farmers, miners, and lumber companies. Without
private ownership, ejido farmers have had little incentive to improve
their properties for future generations, and this has contributed to
the degradation of the land. The uncertainty of land rights in
general, made worse by repeated confiscations, has caused even private
property owners to neglect their lands. Many farmers, therefore,
choose to exploit their land for short-term profits instead of
spending the time and money in irrigation and crop rotation to protect
their lands. As a result, overuse has depleted much of Mexico's best
soil and made marginal farm lands barren. For example, ejido farmers
in the southern state of Chiapas are destroying large segments of
tropical forests in primitive slash and burn techniques in order to
open new land for planting. <P>
     The degradation of the rural environment should stop once
Salinas's reforms take hold. The new constitution gives farmers
ownership and, consequently, responsibility over the protection and
long-term care of these lands. Possessing property rights, farmers no
longer will have an incentive to destroy the rural environment.
<P>
     Mexico's forests also will be better protected under the agrarian
reforms. Today 80 percent of Mexican forests are held communally or
owned by the federal government. These lands are often rented to
lumber companies for short-term contracts to harvest trees. The
absence of private property rights means that those who have temporary
control of the resources will be motivated to make the quickest profit
from them. A U.S. Embassy study found that such a system created
"every incentive to clear-cut the land and little to replant."
(Barnes, op. cit. p. 5.) The recent reforms allow private ownership of
forestry lands. Since land now can be owned for long periods, rather
than being rented for only a few years, owners will have incentives to
replant trees for future harvests.
<P>
     Creating Strategic Stability.Mexico is America's most populous
neighbor and one of the most important countries in Latin America.
There is no escaping the reality that instability there will adversely
affect the U.S. Massive immigration into the U.S. is only one example
of domestic problems which have their origin in Mexico. Social and
political instability there would produce unforeseeable and disturbing
consequences along the 2,000 mile border. Only by securing Mexico's
stability can the U.S. hope to cope with these threats.
  <P>   Social and political stability will be served well by Salinas's
agricultural reforms. If the agricultural economy grows, more jobs
will be created and the standard of living of Mexican farmers will
rise. Economic growth is a critical element of social and political
stability in Mexico.
     <P>
     For most of their common history, relations between the U.S. and
Mexico have been distant and difficult. Now, with Salinas's reforms
and improved relations with the U.S., there is the opportunity to move
beyond this legacy. The signing of the NAFTA is an historic
achievement, for it joins the two countries together in an ever-closer
relationship and creates the foundation for them not just to get along
but to become partners in North America. In the uncertainties of the
post-Cold War world, the U.S. will have a need for new friends.
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     Privatizing Mexico's ejido, or state-owned communal farming
system, is the most radical, and yet the most necessary of Salinas's
economic reforms. The radical agrarian reforms of the 1917 Mexican
Revolution were seen by many as justified by the country's feudal
past. At first, they were focused on breaking the power of the landed
elite and providing land to millions of peasants who previously had
none. However, 75 years of land confiscations, redistributions, and
other forms of government intervention have devastated Mexican
agriculture and the very peasantry they were intended to help. The
increasing government role in agriculture during those decades,
combined with the Mexican Constitution's bias against private
property, created an environment in which the government effectively
replaced the wealthy landlords of the past with its own form of
dominance over the Mexican farmer. By the 1980s the Mexican ejido
system served neither the farmer nor the country as a whole. 
<P>
     Salinas's reforms have transformed the way Mexicans look at land
and at their government's role in the economic and social life of the
countryside. By breaking with the agricultural socialism of the past
and by creating the conditions for the flourishing of a market
economy, Salinas has set the stage for a far-reaching and
overwhelmingly beneficial transformation of Mexico's countryside.
Modernization will bring increased output, rising incomes, and
increased exports.  
<P>
     For Mexico, the benefits from this reform reach far beyond the
new wealth it will create. The Mexican environment is certain to be
better protected as more land is placed in private hands. Democracy
also will be strengthened as Mexican peasants increase their control
over the land they work. As their economic freedoms grow, the power of
the state to control their lives will diminish. These agricultural
reforms are one more step in bringing Mexico into the modern world and
in providing its population with the prosperity and freedom they have
so long sought. For this reason alone, the U.S. stands to benefit
greatly. 
<P>
     For the United States, there are direct benefits as well. U.S.
consumers will benefit from better choices and lower costs resulting
from expanded, more efficient production. American farm equipment
producers and agricultural businesses will profit from the new markets
for farm and irrigation equipment, seeds, and fertilizers. In
addition, U.S. investment in Mexican agriculture, one shunned, is now
encouraged, opening opportunities for joint ventures between Mexican
and U.S. agribusiness companies. All told, the economic benefits to
the U.S. from the opening of Mexico's food industry will be measured
in the billions of dollars, and ten of thousands of Americans jobs.
And, as a solution to Mexico's pressing problem of providing jobs for
its rural population, an expanding Mexican economy will stem the flow
of illegal immigrants to the United States.
  <P>   Ratification of the NAFTA, of course, is essential to the U.S.
benefitting from these reforms, for only when goods and services can
pass freely between the two countries will American consumers and
businesses be able to make use of these new opportunities.

(Updating Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 133, "The Clinton
Nuclear Deal with Pyongyang: Road Map to Progress or Dead End
Street?," November 4, 1994)
</CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>


     The Clinton Administration's Korea policy, focused as it is on
North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, falls short of dealing with the
larger question of North-South conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Over
two months ago, the Clinton Administration inked an "Agreed
Framework" with North Korea to freeze Pyongyang's maverick nuclear
program. Despite this agreement, North Korea downed a U.S. helicopter
on December 17, 1994, killing one U.S. airman and detaining another
on false charges of American espionage. These are grim reminders that
Cold War tensions continue on the Korean Peninsula and that the
37,000 U.S. soldiers stationed there remain in harm's way. Nearly two
million troops face off across a heavily fortified demilitarized zone.
Three decades of on-again, off-again talks between Pyongyang and Seoul
have produced no significant progress in reducing tensions. Although a
cease-fire ending the Korean War was signed in 1953, the two sides
technically remain at war. The Clinton nuclear deal with North Korea
does not deal with the totality of this threat. Nor does it address the
underlying tensions between North and South which are at the heart of
the conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
<P>
<B> Clinton's Generous Deal with North Korea</B>
  <P>   The Clinton deal with North Korea is heavily "front-loaded" in favor
of Pyongyang and makes generous political and financial concessions to the
North. While enhancing its international status through direct dialogue with
the U.S., Pyongyang is allowed substantial delays in fulfilling past promises
to check its nuclear weapons program. For example, the North will keep
intact for ten years or more the nuclear fuel enrichment facility that it
pledged not to possess under a 1992 agreement with the Republic of Korea
(ROK). Under the Clinton agreement, therefore, full nuclear transparency in
the North will not be realized for a decade or longer.
 <P>
     However, the nuclear issue is by no means the only threat to vital
U.S. interests on the peninsula. A key flaw in the Administration's Korea
policy is its excessive focus on the nuclear problem. Left inadequately
addressed is the continuing high state of tensions between North and South
Korea and the immediate danger posed by the North's massive military
force, which includes chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. The death of yet another American soldier at the hands of the
world's most volatile communist regime should remind Americans that, on
the Korean Peninsula, serious threats to U.S. interests linger. The
Administration should be pressed to rethink its short-sighted policy and
vigorously pursue progress in North-South tension reduction.
<P>
     The October 21 agreement between the U.S. and North Korea needs
to be strengthened. In particular, its clauses to reduce tensions between the
North and South, if handled appropriately, could serve important mutual
U.S. and ROK interests. The Clinton Administration, however, does not
appear adequately prepared or even willing to apply appropriate pressure on
Pyongyang to abide by these clauses. The State Department, for example,
which brokered the deal with Pyongyang, has not expressed its intention to
link steps toward reducing tensions with the benefits offered to the North
under the agreement.
<P>
<B> Congress Should Intervene</B>
<P>     To get U.S.-Korea policy on track, Congress needs to take a more
active role. While limited in its ability to make foreign policy, Congress
does have the mechanism of a Joint Resolution to express its will. Thus,
through a Joint Resolution, it should now construct precise policy guidelines
to improve the protection of America's interests and those of its South
Korean ally. 
<P>
     A framework already exists for reducing North-South tensions: the
Reconciliation and Denuclearization Agreements ratified by Seoul and
Pyongyang in 1992. The many ambitious commitments made in these pacts,
such as opening the border to citizen exchanges, have never been
implemented, and the Clinton Administration, for all intents and purposes,
has ignored them, preferring a direct approach to Pyongyang.
<P>
     Recent statements by State Department officials indicate that the
Clinton Administration chooses not to get directly or systematically involved
in promoting the North-South dialogue. The process is the responsibility
primarily of the Koreans themselves, these officials say. Yet, without
appropriate and consistent pressure, North Koreans will continue to avoid
contact with the South in hopes of isolating the ROK and driving a wedge
between Seoul and Washington.
 <P>
     The time is right for Congress to press the Clinton Administration
for improved North-South relations. With a large U.S. troop presence in the
South and a resulting defense burden costing American taxpayers more than
$2 billion per year, it clearly is in the vital national security interest of the
U.S. to promote substantive inter-Korean political, economic, social, and
military confidence-building measures and tension reduction. Such progress
not only would ease the threat of conflict, but also would begin to pry the
lid off North Korea's closed society and open the way for eventual reform
there. It also would assuage an increasingly nervous South Korean
government and populace who believe they have been sold short by
Washington.
<P>
<B> Use America's Considerable Leverage</B>
   <P>  The North Koreans likely will resist such actions and complain
loudly and bitterly. However, they desperately want the new agreement to
survive so they can reap significant gains. They are eager for a massive aid
package -- conservatively estimated at more than $4 billion -- that will be
funded mainly by Seoul and Tokyo. Also eagerly anticipated in Pyongyang
are diplomatic recognition by the Clinton Administration and an end to the
U.S. trade embargo. Finally, Pyongyang is obliged to pursue tension
reduction under Section III of the October 21 agreement with the U.S.,
under which North Korea agreed that it will "engage in North-South
dialogue" and "take steps to implement the North-South Joint Declaration
on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
 <P>
     Since the North reaps great benefits from its deal with the U.S.,
America has some leverage over Pyongyang. Thus, a strong show of U.S.
determination is in order. It was a lack of political will that led the
Administration to make too many concessions to Pyongyang on October 21.
Past experience indicates that the North will be compelled to behave
responsibly only when Washington follows a steady, strong course. America
also should look for support in these endeavors from China, North Korea's
largest trading partner, and Japan, which eventually is expected to offer
Pyongyang a generous assistance package after normalization of relations
with the South. If Pyongyang balks at a dialogue with Seoul, this should
trigger trade pressure on the North by Beijing and Tokyo and the delay of
Japanese-North Korean diplomatic normalization.
<P>
<B> A Joint Resolution</B>
   <P>  To strengthen the standing of the U.S. and its allies under the
agreement, Congress should consider a Joint Resolution recommending that
the Clinton Administration:
<P>
Press for immediate resumption of long-stalled North-South talks and link
implementation of the October 21 U.S.-North Korea agreement with
substantive and rapid progress in reducing tensions. This position is
consistent with the spirit and letter of the agreement. Section III of the pact
calls for improvements in North-South relations.
<P>
Revive the Reconciliation and Denuclearization Agreements between Seoul
and Pyongyang. These agreements were ratified but never implemented.
 <P>
Appoint a seasoned negotiator as a presidential envoy to communicate
directly with Pyongyang regarding this new policy and to coordinate with
South Korea and other concerned nations.
<P>
     In concert with Seoul, the Administration should identify timetables
for reducing North-South tensions through:
<P>
Dismantling promptly the North's nuclear reprocessing facility.
Exchanging North-South liaison offices.
<P>
Expanding North-South trade relations.
<P>
Opening the border to free travel and communication by citizens of each
side.
<P>
Providing for mutual notification of major troop movements and major
military exercises.
<P>
Pulling back troops from both sides of the demilitarized zone.
Introducing phased reductions of armaments and troops.
<P>
Replacing the current cease-fire with a North-South peace treaty.
<P>
     Congress should require that, within three months of the resolution's
passage, the Administration report to Congress on the progress it has made
in implementing both the October 21 agreement and these recommendations.
If Congress is not satisfied, it should consider using its budgetary authority
to curtail or block altogether the generous benefits bestowed upon
Pyongyang by the October 21 U.S.-North Korea agreement.

<hr size = 3 width = 30%>
</center>
<P>


<UL>      I believe it is time for a new era in environmental
      protection which uses the market to help us get our
      environment back on track - to recognize that Adam Smith's
      invisible hand can have a green thumb... [In] certain
      settings, this results-oriented approach can cut compliance
      costs, shrink regulatory bureaucracies, enlist corporate
      support, take environmental policy away from the
      specialists and lobbyists, and open it up more to the
      general public.<BR>
                   <I>  Bill Clinton,<BR> 
                     Drexel University, Earth Day, April 22, 1992.</I></UL>
<P>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
<P>      President-elect Clinton, if you really intend to use market
forces to reach reasonable environmental objectives, and make results
the test for legislative or regulatory action, that truly would be a
welcome and positive change in environmental policy. To accomplish
this sensible change, you will need to address a number of issues from
a fresh perspective. If you do so, you have the opportunity to end the
traditional conflict that pits environmental protection against jobs,
and give substance to your campaign claim that the conflict is a
"false choice."

<P> If you do not approach environmental policy in this different
way, however, and instead merely add a new layer of environmental
regulations to existing ones, you are doomed to fail not in only your
economic mission, but in your environmental mission as well. Contrary
to the "false choice" argument, today's environmental policies
generally do pit environmental protection against jobs. And the longer
the list of environmental regulations, the longer the unemployment
lines. 

 <P>     To give Adam Smith a green thumb, as you say you wish to do,
will require carefully crafted action on environmental issues. Five in
particular will confront your new Administration: 
<P>
1) Superfund. Superfund legislation will be up for reauthorization
      next year, providing an excellent opportunity for reform.
<P>
2)    Global Warming and Carbon Taxes. Last year's Earth Summit did
      not put this issue to rest. There is likely to be a bill
      introduced in Congress to combat the alleged global warming
      problem, through the creation of a tax on carbon dioxide
      emissions.
<P>
3)    Fuel Economy Standards. There is certain to be legislation
      introduced to raise the average fuel economy for a car maker's
      fleet to 40-45 miles per gallon.
<P>
4)    Wetlands. Wetlands disputes continued throughout the Bush
      Administration without resolution. This year, the final
      resolution of the subject will rest on your shoulders.
<P>
5)    Solid Waste and Recycling. Solid waste legislation is up for
      reauthorization, and some in Congress wish to alter radically
      the substance of the Act.

<P> Addressing these and other environmental issues from the sound
approach you have outlined requires you to shape policies using three
underlying techniques:

<P>Use of markets and property rights where possible to distribute
environmental "goods" efficiently and equitably. This will help you to
promote conservation and reduce pollution to acceptable levels. 
<P>
Base policies on sound and credible science, to ensure that problems
are real, and to determine the true levels of risk. This will mean
ignoring orchestrated media hysteria and "expert" testimony by movie
stars, and asking instead for hard scientific evidence.
<P>
Develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent
of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing
that harm to acceptable levels. This will allow Americans to receive
the maximum environmental "bang for the buck" -- or to achieve
environmental objectives with the fewest pink slips for American
workers. 

<P> Applying these techniques to the major environmental issues
before you suggest a number of specific actions you should take.
<P>SUPERFUND
<P>
Action 1: Require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set
immediately a specific cancer risk level that it defines as an
unacceptable risk. Currently, EPA can choose between different risk
levels to apply in its determination of whether a particular site
poses a cancer risk. This gives arbitrary power to bureaucrats without
giving Americans a guaranteed degree of safety. 
<P>
Action 2: Factor real exposure levels into decisions to list sites for
clean-up. Sites should be listed for remediaton only if they actually
will expose people to risk.
<P>
Action 3: Require EPA to develop within six months a list for
different Superfund site characteristics, together with the required
level of clean-up for each site. It is unnecessary to clean-up all
sites to the same degree; some pose more risk than others.
<P>
Action 4: Draw up a priority list for clean-up of orphan Superfund
sites based on the site characteristics developed by EPA, the exposure
classification, and the estimated remediation costs. Essentially the
list should correspond to a formula, determining overall risk per
dollar of remediation costs. This will end the current system of
relying on ad hoc decisions as to which sites are more important.
<P>
Action 5: Immediately instruct EPA to require lowest-bid contractors
to post assurance, such as an interest-bearing bond, when awarded
contracts for remediation of orphan sites. This will reduce the
overall cost borne by the government.
<P>
Action 6: Urge Congress to require private parties responsible for
remediation of privately owned sites that are listed as potential
Superfund sites, or low priority sites, to provide assurance. This
will ensure that monies remain available for remediation even if the
private party goes bankrupt. Meanwhile, society's economic resources
will not be squandered on sites that may never pose a threat.
<P>
Action 7: Urge Congress to reform Superfund's inequitable methods for
findings of liability. Joint and several liability currently applies
to findings of liability for remediation of Superfund sites. This
means that those responsible for only minute quantities of hazardous
waste become liable for the full costs of multi-million-dollar clean-
ups. Further, innocent owners who purchased their property before
passage of Superfund legislation should not be liable for the clean-up
of their property since they neither contaminated the sites nor were
given notice of liability. 
<P>
GLOBAL WARMING 
<P>
Action 1: Pledge continued support for increasing funding levels for
global climate change research. Most of what we know about global
warming has been learned within the last three to four years, thanks
to increased research. This trend should continue.
<P>
Action 2: Within 100 days, open up the relevant government archives to
researchers, subject to national security concerns. This would allow
researchers to gain access to a wealth of raw data collected over the
decades by America's intelligence agencies. Any access must, of
course, be tightly controlled and limited to this purpose.
<P>
Action 3: Announce that you will oppose legislative efforts to impose
a carbon tax. A carbon tax would cause the loss of an estimated
600,000 jobs and cost the nation approximately $100 billion per year.
This is too great a price to pay to insure against the possible
consequences of an unproven theory in light of more reasonable
approaches -- such as increasing the knowledge base.
<P>
FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE) 
<P>
Action 1: Announce immediately that you will veto legislative attempts
to raise CAFE standards. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards regulate the average miles per gallon that a car maker's
fleet must obtain. Advocates of raising the current standard from 27.5
mpg to 40 or 45 mpg ignore the fact that this policy change will
result in thousands of avoidable highway fatalities.
<P>
Action 2: Press for new legislation to replace CAFE standards with
pollution fees. These would be directly proportional to the amount of
pollution emitted from automobile tailpipes, making polluters pay the
costs of their actions.
<P>
WETLANDS
<P>
Action 1: Instruct EPA to exclude from protection those wetlands from
which pollutants cannot in practice migrate to "waters of the United
States." These would include wetlands where the physical structure or
location of the wetlands makes it impossible for pollutants to migrate
to a "water of the United States" -- the term used in legislation --
via normal water flows. This will return the protection of wetlands to
its original meaning.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order
requiring the government to pay landowners the value of their
confiscated property rights when development is denied to protect
societally beneficial wetlands. It antithetical to the American system
of government not to do so. If government confiscation of private
property rights benefits the public, the public should pay for it --
not some hapless landowner.
<P>
Action 3: If you want to protect all wetlands -- even those where
pollutants cannot migrate to "waters of the United States" -- enact a
Wetland Protection Act giving EPA the authority to do so. Currently,
the authority is lacking.
<P>
SOLID WASTE
<P>
Action 1: Announce that you will oppose mandatory recycling or
packaging reduction legislation. This will allow the nation to devote
its scarce economic resources to truly important environmental
problems.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order to
eliminate most of the current costly landfill regulations and require
financial assurances from operators. This will allow operators to
devise the least costly way to contain pollutants. This order should
require landfill operators to provide financial assurances, such as
interest bearing bonds, to assure compliance or funds for clean-up. 
<P>
      President-elect Clinton, you said during your Earth Day speech
last year that you prefer using markets to regulation. Now is the time
to translate that preference into public policy. This will take
backbone. Although you want to "open [environmental policy] up more to
the general public" by instituting market reforms, you will face
fierce opposition from environmental lobbyists that have a strong
vested interest in the regulatory status quo. But if you wish to use
markets to increase protection of the environment without destroying
jobs in the process, you must fundamentally overhaul the methods used
by government.

<P> Specifically, you must replace Superfund and landfill regulation
with a system of financial assurances. You also must substitute for
CAFE standards, which needlessly squander lives, a system of fees
based on the amount of pollution emitted from automobile tailpipes.
You must pay landowners for the value of the property taken in
wetlands-regulating confiscation. And you must quickly and
exponentially increase our knowledge of the global warming issue
through fostering increased research and by opening up the relevant
archives. Simultaneously, you should resist imposing a economically
devastating carbon tax that will throw hundreds of thousands of
Americans out of work to address what may be a theory full of "hot
air."

<P> Finally, and most important, you must create a priority list of
environmental concerns. Base this list on the extent of the harm
caused by the problem divided by the cost to address the problem. This
will provide you with a mechanism to obtain the maximum environmental
protection possible for the amount of economic resources used. Without
this list, costs will be needlessly high and environmental protection
will be needlessly low.
<P>
SUPERFUND: REFORM BASED ON RISK 

<P> The Superfund legislation was enacted in 1980, under the formal
name of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act or CERCLA (pronounced sir-kluh). CERCLA has failed
utterly in its mission of cleaning up old hazardous waste sites.
Billions of dollars have been spent, but large portions of this money
has been spent on legal costs, not clean-up. In fact, only 149 of the
1,275 listed superfund sites have been cleaned up. To clean the
remaining sites, EPA's costs alone -- excluding the costs to
businesses and insurance companies -- will run approximately $40
billion. Also many more sites will be listed, thus driving costs up
even higher. Total costs to the nation in the next thirty years are
estimated at $300 billion in 1990 dollars. (General Accounting Office,
"Superfund Program Management," High Risk Series, December 1992.) 

<P> Although EPA has considerably improved its oversight management
of this program since the mid-1980s, the agency still has a long way
to go. Many of the factors evaluated in the site listing process are
given varying importance, depending on the particular EPA decision-
maker. The uncertainty and poor decision-making that can result from
this practice needs to end. Moreover, Congress should recognize that,
while the legislation was well-intentioned, it has become a vehicle to
prosecute innocent landowners and businesses through the liability
laws applicable under CERCLA. Not only that, the distorted legal
framework for findings of liability unnecessarily depresses the real
estate market by discouraging lenders from making loans. Bills have
been introduced in Congress and rules have been proposed by EPA to
resolve this problem. (For example, in Congress, H.R. 4494 was
introduced by Representative John LaFalce and S. 2827 was introduced
by Senator Jake Garn in 1990; the proposed EPA rule was published in
the Federal Register, June 24, 1991, 5(121), p.28798.) But the issue
remains unsolved. (Jan Paul Acton, Lloyd S. Dixon, Superfund and
Transaction Costs: The Experiences of Insurers and Very Large
Industrial Firms," The Institute for Civil Justice, Rand, 1992.)
Congress should remedy this situation.
<P>
The key changes needed:
<P>
Action 1: Require EPA to set immediately a specific cancer risk level
that it defines as an unacceptable risk. Currently, EPA uses a range of "risks" to define when the
probability of contracting cancer crosses the line from being an
acceptable risk to an unacceptable risk. So one EPA official may
consider a site to be "hazardous," and thus subject to Superfund
legislation, if the risk of cancer from the materials at the site is
one in ten thousand over a lifetime. But another EPA official may use
a risk level of one in a million to determine if a site is
"hazardous." Still others may use various different risk levels,
depending on the site being examined. 

<P>      There is no justification for using a range of risk. The problem
is obvious. This range results in some unnecessary site clean-ups and
some sites remaining unlisted which possibly should be cleaned up.
("Striking a Better Balance: Improving Superfund Clean-up Decisions,"
Report to Coalition on Superfund, Arthur D. Little, Inc., May 1992,
page 18.)

<P> Mr. Clinton, you should instruct EPA to choose a single,
specific risk level that is acceptable, and to justify that decision.
From that point onward, EPA's discretion to pick an arbitrary standard
should cease.

<P>Action 2: Factor real exposure levels into decisions to list sites for
clean-up. 
<P>      The Office of Technology Assessment has found that clean-up
decisions at the majority of Superfund sites are based on hypothetical
future risks rather than on actual or likely risks. ("Coming Clean:
Superfund Problems Can Be Solved... ," Office of Technology
Assessment, October, 1989.) This means that remote or inaccessible
contaminated sites that pose no current or even any likely future
danger to people's health are given just as high a priority as sites
that expose people to a real present danger.

 <P>     Superfund sites should instead be classified based on categories
of actual, likely, and potential risks of human exposure to the site.
The way to do this, Mr. Clinton, is for you to instruct EPA by
executive order to classify sites according to these categories. The
exposure level risks within each category should be given a numerical
weight by the EPA so that the relative risk of each site can be
determined.
<P>
Action 3: Require EPA within six months to develop a list for
different Superfund site characteristics, together with the required
level of clean-up for each site, such as an industrial or residential
area. 
<P>      Within each site type, EPA would then assign a different level
of clean-up required, with justification for the designated level. For
instance, in a residential area, where the risk of exposure to
children playing in contaminated soil is relatively high, the de-
contaminated soil would need to be cleaner than the de-contaminated
soil in, say, a warehouse park, where less direct exposure would be
anticipated. A range of clean-up requirements of this kind would cut
Superfund compliance costs at some sites enormously, thus reducing
CERCLA's burden on the economy.
<P>
Action 4: Based on the site characteristics developed by EPA, draw up
a priority list for Superfund clean-up.
<P>      To deal with this, you should instruct EPA to develop a priority
list for superfund clean-up. This priority list would be based on the
exposure classification and the type of site, as well as estimated
remediation costs. The list would be derived from a formula allowing
EPA to arrive at an overall risk per dollar of remediation costs. This
can be accomplished by issuing an executive order.
<P>
Action 5: Immediately instruct EPA to require lowest-bid contractors
to post assurance, such as an interest-bearing bond, when awarded
contracts for remediation of orphan sites.
<P>      Whenever solvent liable parties cannot be found to clean up old
hazardous sites, the government becomes responsible for these "orphan"
sites. Contractors for orphan site remediation often have been paid
substantial sums even if no work is performed. Worse, contractors that
fail to clean up a site properly increase the total costs borne by the
government -- and ultimately the taxpayer.

<P>      Under new rules, lowest-bid contractors of orphan sites should
be required to post an interest-bearing bond when awarded remediation
contracts. This would ensure that monies were available for
remediation if the contractor improperly cleaned the site or became
insolvent. Contractors should be made legally liable for the
remediation and be given total freedom to choose methods of clean-up
without permission from the government. If the contractor failed to
remediate the site adequately for any reason, then the bond would
become forfeit and another contractor could be selected and paid with
the bond proceeds. (See Richard Stroup, "Selling Orphan (Superfund)
Sites," Political Economy Research Center, Bozeman, Montana, September
25, 1988.)
<P>
Action 6: Urge Congress to require private parties responsible for
remediation of privately owned sites that are listed as potential
Superfund sites, or low priority sites, to provide assurance.
<P>      In dealing with potential, or low priority, Superfund sites, EPA
is faced with a dilemma. If solvent liable parties can be identified,
the government is encouraged to require remediation; if it waits, the
liable parties may become insolvent, leaving the government with an
orphan site. Yet the site may never pose a threat to warrant clean-up.
To avoid the unnecessary costs resulting from this situation, liable
parties should be required to provide assurance.
<P>
Action 7: Urge Congress to reform Superfund's inequitable methods for
findings of liability.
<P>      Two particular changes are needed. The first is to eliminate
joint and several liability. This concept is a sham designed to find
somebody -- anybody -- other than Uncle Sam to pay for clean-ups of
hazardous waste. Under the doctrine the "responsible" person often has
no part or only a small part in creating the waste problem. If, say,
someone has caused 2 percent of a hazardous waste problem, that
individual or institution will become liable for the full cost of the
remedy. In practice, this means that a firm with "deep pockets" pays
for the clean-up of wastes created by another individual or firm. The
law should be amended to require that the percentage of clean-up costs
for which an individual or body is liable is no greater than the
percentage of the contamination they contributed.

<P>      The second necessary change is to divorce the status of property
ownership from findings of liability. 

<P>      What happens today is that a landowner who bought property that
was contaminated before 1980, when Superfund was enacted, is legally
responsible for the total cost of clean-up. Yet the owner neither
caused the waste nor could be given notice of liability for any clean-
up, since Superfund was not law at the time. This ownership basis for
liability leads to a host of problems. One is that it makes lending
institutions wary of repossessing properties in default because the
lender would then become liable for cleaning up any old hazardous
wastes that may be on the property. And since the collateral provides
less security because the lender is wary of foreclosure, the lenders
are less willing to make loans. This depresses segments of the real
estate market. (See footnotes 2 and 3 and accompanying text for a
brief description of actions proposed to correct this problem.) 
<P>
GLOBAL WARMING 
  <P>    Global warming, also known as the "enhanced greenhouse effect,"
is a theory that has gained growing attention over the last decade.
Basically the theory predicts that human-caused greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide will increase the average temperature of the earth.
This theory is the mirror image of the ice age theory popular about
fifteen or twenty years ago. Although the vast majority of climate
change scientists do not believe a runaway greenhouse effect will
occur, a vocal minority has maintained its probability. 

<P>      Although a severe greenhouse effect is improbable, whether more
minor atmospheric changes will occur within the next century is
subject to much debate. (John Shanahan, "Guide to the Global Warming
Issue," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 896, May 21, 1992.) If
warming does occur, however, most of the temperature increase would
occur at night and at high latitudes, which could be beneficial,
rather than increasing daytime high temperatures. Moreover, most of
the models upon which climate change predictions are premised have
been flawed. For instance, one of the most widely known models
effectively moved the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the sun.
(The study, by Sukryo Munabe and Richard Wetherald of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1975 noted that it
had increased the sun's output by 6 percent above its actual output,
which is equivalent to moving the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer
to the sun. Still other models have incorrectly forecast that clouds
warm the earth, but new studies show that clouds actually cool the
earth; this is significant since cloud cover is increasing. V.

Ahmad, D. Hartmann, "Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from
the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment," Science, Vol. 243, January 6,
1989.)
<P>
Action 1: Pledge continued levels of research funding on global
climate change.
<P>      Most of what scientists know about global climate change has
been learned within the last three to four years due to the Bush
Administration's massive research effort. The U.S. now spends about
$1.4 billion per year -- more than all other nations on earth combined
-- on climate research, and the funding has been going up at the rate
of about 25 percent per year. It is likely that our knowledge will
grow ten-fold again within the next five years.

<P>Action 2: Within 100 days, open up the relevant federal archives to
researchers, subject to national security concerns.
<P>      The scientific debate over global warming could be improved if
you would order agencies to open up the relevant national archives to
researchers -- subject to legitimate national security concerns, such
as sources and methods of intelligence-gathering. This would be useful
because surveillance satellites and aircraft, submarines, and oceanic
vessels have collected a vast amount of data that can be used to
accelerate research. For example, the material could help resolve
questions about past contours and thaw rates of polar caps, ocean
chemistry, and many other issues.
<P>
Action 3: Announce that you will oppose legislative efforts to impose
a carbon tax. 
 <P>     Action to limit carbon dioxide emissions to lessen the effects
of the theoretical runaway greenhouse effect will be costly to jobs
and put an undue burden on household budgets. Yet there is no firm
evidence that runaway global warming will occur -- in fact, according
to a survey by the environmental group Geenpeace, the vast majority of
scientists believe it will not. (Greenpeace Press Release, "Climate
Scientists Fear Effects of Understanding Global Warming, Poll Shows,"
February 9, 1992.)

   <P>   Taxes on carbon emissions are popularly viewed as the best way
to reduce carbon output levels to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But if
carbon taxes are imposed, many Americans would be thrown out of jobs.
A study by the CONSAD Research Corporation found that five years after
the imposition of a $100 per ton carbon tax -- the tax amount needed
to reduce carbon to 1990 levels -- some 600,000 jobs would be lost.
The tax also would reduce total GNP by approximately 2 percent, or
$100 billion. (Congressional Budget Office, "Carbon Charges as a
Response to Global Warming: The Effects of Taxing Fossil Fuels,"
August 1990.) This is the equivalent to a $1,250 tax on every
household in America. The price of basic goods would rise
substantially. For instance, according to the Department of Energy,
electrical and natural gas heating costs would rise by 27 percent.
("Limiting Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United States," U.S.
Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Analysis, Deputy Under
Secretary for Policy, Planning and Analysis, September 1991.)

<P>      A study by the George C. Marshall Institute has found that "a
five year delay in limiting carbon emissions will make the world
warmer in the next century by at most one tenth of a degree [Celsius],
compared to how warm it would be if there was no delay." (see Marshall
Institute, "Global Warming Update: Recent Scientific Findings"
(Washington, D.C. 1992).) Since our knowledge will increase
dramatically in those five years, and the theory may well prove false
or overstated, taking expensive action now probably would be
foolhardy.
<P>
      
FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE)
<P>      Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards , enacted in
1975 in response to the oil crisis of 1973, were designed to stabilize
oil at low prices. Today, CAFE mandates that automobile manufacturers
build cars that average 27.5 miles per gallon.

 <P>     Today, the primary support for CAFE standards comes from the
environmental community, which is concerned with energy conservation
and the perceived threat of global warming, (Global warming is
addressed in the following section.) which, if it is occurring, would
be exacerbated by carbon emissions from cars. Unfortunately, CAFE is
the wrong tool to address these concerns, and a dangerous one.
Alternative policies would be far less burdensome and far more
effective.

<P>      The most serious problem with CAFE standards, to put it bluntly,
is that they kill people. According to economists Robert Crandall of
the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of
Public Health, 1989 model cars are about 500 pounds lighter than they
would have been in the absence of the 27.5 miles per gallon fuel
economy standard. Crandall and Graham estimate that this weight
reduction will result in 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000 additional
serious injuries for the model year fleet. (Robert W. Crandall and
John D. Graham, "New Fuel-Economy Standards, The Politics of Energy,"
The American Enterprise, March/April 1991, p. 68.)

 <P>     If fuel efficiency standards are raised further, even more
deaths can be anticipated. If the standard is raised to 40 mpg, deaths
will likely surge to between 4,800 to 8,600 additional deaths per
model year fleet. That is why Bush Energy Secretary Admiral James
Watkins referred to a 1991 bill to raise CAFE standards as the
"Highway Death Act of 1991." (For further information, see William G.
Laffer III, "Auto Cafe Standards: Unsafe and Unwise At Any Level,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 825, April 19, 1991.)

<P>      Proponents of raising the standards will tell you that, if
standards are phased in slowly, car makers will be able to make cars
just as safe through technological improvement, even if they are
lighter, or that cars will be more efficient so that car weights will
not need to be reduced. Both arguments may be true, but they miss the
point. If lighter cars in the future will be more safe, future cars
with today's weights will be safer still. Similarly, if future cars
can be made more fuel-efficient at today's weights, then they can be
made just as efficient as today's cars, but at heavier weights. In
either case, thousands more Americans will die each year as a direct
result of the CAFE standards.
<P>
Action 1: Immediately announce that you will veto legislative attempts
to raise CAFE standards.
 <P>     This legislation will surely be forthcoming in your first year
in office. If CAFE legislation receives your signature, the political
responsibility for those deaths will rest squarely on your shoulders.
Press stories that question whether Johnny who crashed into a
telephone pole would have lived but for "Clinton's CAFE Act" could
well result.
<P>
Action 2: Press for new legislation to replace CAFE standards with
pollution fees.
<P>      Instead of relying on regulatory bureaucracies, Mr. Clinton, it
is time, in your own words, to use "the market to get our environment
back on track." In areas of the country with air pollution problems,
fees should be assessed according to the severity of the local
pollution problem, the emission level of each individual vehicle, and
the number of miles each vehicle is driven. Since 50 percent of all
car pollution is caused by 10 percent of the cars, this will provide a
powerful economic incentive for owners of polluting cars to tune up or
scrap their cars. CAFE standards, on the other hand, place financial
penalties on those Americans who buy new cars, which are already the
cleanest cars on the road.
<P>
WETLANDS PROTECTION ISSUES 
<P>      Wetlands loss has been extensive since the founding of the
nation. An estimated 53 percent of the original number of acres has
been lost -- still leaving over 100 million acres. ("Natural Resources
Management Issues," General Accounting Office, Transition Series,
December 1992.) Moreover, most of the loss was attributable to
government draining of mosquito-infested swamplands or wetlands that
hampered navigation of waterways. (Ironically, the government agency
that drained these wetlands -- the Army Corps of Engineers -- now has
as its primary mission the enforcement of wetlands regulations.)
Today, less than one-fourth of one percent of the total is lost
yearly, and much of this small amount serves no ecologically
beneficial purpose. 

 <P>     Wetlands are currently protected under Sections 301 and 404 of
the 1977 Clean Water Act (CWA). This law regulates the discharge of
pollutants into "waters of the United States." (This term, while
ill-defined, should properly be construed to inlcude any water body
from which discharged pollutants could migrate via natural water flows
into interstate waterways.) But wetlands regulation has gone beyond
the authority granted or intended during passage of the Act. Instead,
EPA has used Sections 301 and 404 as a way to protect all wetlands for
their ecological value, such as waterfowl habitat. (For further
information, see William G. Laffer, III, "Protecting Ecologically
Valuable Wetlands Without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 840, July 15, 1990. Note that the
Delineation Manuel described in Laffer's paper is the 1989 Manual; the
Manual currently in effect is the 1987 Delineation Manual to which
EPA's regulatory authority has been returned. Nevertheless, EPA still
protects all wetlands for their ecological value regardless of what
criteria are used to define wetlands.) The EPA also has been depriving
landowners of the value of their properties without compensating them
for their loss, forcing many into bankruptcy. While there have been
ongoing court challenges, the results have been unclear, and have
merely fueled further litigation. In fact, wetlands regulation has now
become so inflexible that it has led to many outrageous or ridiculous
results. For instance, wetlands rules have blocked construction of low
income housing all over the country, delayed construction of shelter
for the homeless in Alaska for over a year, and even resulted in the
jailing of one environmentalist for making duck ponds. (Ibid. See also
"EPA's Most Wanted," The Wall Street Journal, November 18, 1992, p.
A16.) 

 <P>     Throughout the Bush Administration's term, there was a
fluctuating stance towards wetlands protection. The problem in part
stemmed from the lack of a clear objective. Additionally, the
litigation costs due to the government's dubious authority under
current law have been enormous, thus creating an unnecessary drain on
the economy. You will need to rectify this situation if you wish to
prioritize environmental concerns, and to minimize unnecessary
economic expenditures. Otherwise, it will be one more roadblock in
your economic agenda.

<P>      To do this, Mr. Clinton, you need to take urgent action:
<P>
Action 1: Instruct EPA to exclude from protection those wetlands from
which pollutants cannot in practice migrate to "waters of the United
States."
<P>      EPA's policy should be this: only if pollutants discharged into
a wetland can migrate via natural water flows into other water bodies,
such as streams, rivers, and lakes should government intervene.
(Ibid.) This will return wetlands protection to its original meaning.
The Clean Water Act was extended to wetlands only inorder to restrict
pollution in non-navigable water bodies from entering navigable
waterways. Thus, restricting the polluting of a wetland that is
physically connected to a waterway is proper and was intended in the
legislation; protecting wetlands for wetlands' sake was not.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order
requiring the government to pay landowners the value of lands which
are designated wetlands. 
<P>      When a tract is declared a wetland, it becomes off-limits to
development. Thus a landowner or developer may be forbidden to build a
home on land that he purchased for that purpose. To be sure, society
may gain a benefit from the protection of wetlands, but blocking
development can impose an enormous cost to the owner. If wetlands
protection is for the benefit of the nation, the nation should bear
that cost -- unlucky landowners should not be forced to subsidize the
public. Moreover, requiring the federal government to reimburse the
costs imposed by its regulation will encourage government officials to
determine the priority of protecting a tract. Now, declaring an area a
wetland is a "free" decision to the government, even though that
decision can impose large costs on the economy. 
<P>
Action 3: If you want to protect all wetlands, obtain the necessary
authority through a new Wetlands Protection Act. 
 <P>     Sections 301 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, which today are
considered the sources of authority for wetlands protection, relate
only to pollution discharges that can directly or indirectly pollute
navigable waterways. Thus, enforcement of regulations to protect all
wetlands under these sections has sparked numerous lawsuits. 

<P>      You may feel that the government should have the authority to
protect all wetlands, regardless of the threat to navigable waterways.
If you do, you should seek legislative authority to do so, so the
issue can be debated publicly. Obtaining clear legislation also would
have the advantage of reducing the extensive and costly litigation
resulting from current methods of enforcement under dubious and vague
authority. 
<P>
SOLID WASTE 
<P>      As you consider your policy on the environment, solid waste
legislation should be a low priority. Legislation covering the issue
is contained in Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA). You will hear from some environmentalists that this law
must be strengthened. They will advocate mandatory recycling and
packaging reductions to conserve raw resources and to ease the
"crisis" of shrinking landfill space. This advice is misguided. (For
further information, see John Shanahan, "A Plain Man's Guide to
Garbage: The Reauthorization of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 172, March 30, 1992.) New
rules also would be expensive; EPA estimates that efforts to mandate
recycling and packaging reductions could cost up to $30 billion.
(Assistant Administrator Don R. Clay, Office of Solid Waste and
Emergency Response, Letter to Representative Norman F. Lent, June 16,
1992.        ) You should adopt a very different course of action. 

 <P>     Before you design a policy, you should ask your advisors some
basic questions, and then weigh the evidence. Among the questions you
should ask:

<P>      1) Is there really a landfill "crisis?" The evidence suggests
that there is not. Landfill capacity has been declining 2.8 percent
annually while the amount of waste has been increasing 1.6 percent.
(Shanahan, "Plain Man's Guide," op. cit.) This decline is due to
stricter government regulation, which has quadrupled costs in the last
decade, and to the "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY) syndrome, whereby
local opposition to landfills is triggered by ill-informed health
concerns. Despite this decline, landfill space will be adequate if a
system of financial assurances replaces regulation. 

  <P>    2) What are the real health risks from using landfills and
incinerators? These actually are minimal. Today's new facilities are
state-of-the-art and pose negligible risk to health and safety.
Regulations now are so strict that if an individual sat continuously
for seventy years on an incinerator smokestack operating 24 hours a
day, that person would have only a one-in-a-million chance of
contracting cancer from smokestack pollutants. (Jerry Taylor,
"Municipal Waste Combustion: Toxic Threat or Trivial Pursuit?"
American Legislative Exchange Council Issues Analysis, April 1990.)

<P>      In fact, a major criticism of RCRA is that the regulations have
become too strict, leading to a decline in the construction of safe,
new incinerators and landfills, even though the health risks are
minuscule. 

<P>      3) Do reductions in packaging conserve resources? Paradoxically,
government pressure on businesses to reduce packaging can increase
waste. For instance, a pound of paper packaging used for foods reduces
food waste by an average of only 1.41 pounds, while a pound of plastic
packaging reduces food waste by 1.66 pounds. (Harvey Alter, "The
Origins of Solid Waste: The Relations Between Residues from Packaging
Materials and Food," Waste Management and Research 7, 1989.)

 <P>     Further, businesses already have economic incentives to reduce
packaging weights and volume. After all, the greater the amount of
packaging, the greater the transportation costs. Consequently,
manufacturers have been decreasing their packaging weights steadily
over the past two decades.

 <P>     4) Does recycling always conserve natural resources? Not always.
Recycling can be efficient and environmentally responsible, but it can
also waste resources. Whether it does so depends on the energy
requirements, the region of the country, and the characteristics of
the item to be recycled. Recycling aluminum is worthwhile because
recycling uses 95 percent less energy than making aluminum from
aluminum ore. Hence, businesses tend to recycle aluminum without being
forced to do so by the government. Recycling other products, however,
such as resource-efficient shrink wrap, actually would consume far
more natural and economic resources than making the resources from
virgin materials. Thus collecting, separating, and processing shrink
wrap to recycle would drive up costs to the economy, waste resources,
and cause air pollution.

<P>      5) Can government mandates conserve resources? Any attempt to
conserve resources by interfering with production and packaging
processes has the perverse effect result of wasting resources.
Government policies that mandate packaging reductions or recycling are
designed to encourage firms to substitute for one material another
material that consumes fewer resources. But to know which resources
should be conserved or used in every situation would require the
government to know the exact value of each resource in relation to
other resources. Market prices do this very well because they
fluctuate according to the latest information as to scarcity and
value. But if government attempts to determine resource values without
using prices, it must set the value or "worth" of each resource
according to an arbitrary standard. Hence, the "wrong" resource inputs
will be used in the production process, thus increasing overall
resource consumption. (Shanahan, "Plain Man's Guide," op. cit.)

 <P>     Given these considerations, there are two specific actions that
you should take:
<P>
Action 1: Announce that you will oppose mandatory recycling or
packaging reduction legislation.
<P>      If you do not oppose such legislation, you will be weakening the
economic recovery without any appreciable benefit to the environment.
Ironically, the environment may even be harmed by encouraging wasteful
use of raw resources in the recycling process.
<P>
Action 2: Within 100 days, issue an executive order to eliminate most
of today's costly landfill regulations.
 <P>     Rather than mandating recycling or packaging reductions, it
would be wiser to eliminate most of the current costly landfill
regulations. These erroneous rules are, in large part, responsible for
the nation's landfill capacity decline. You should instead replace
these regulations with a requirement that landfill operators provide
financial assurances, such as interest-bearing bonds, that the
landfills meet government standards of environmental safety. The
operators then should be given free rein to devise the least costly
manner of containing pollutants. But if the operator fails in this
duty, the bonds would become partially or wholly forfeit to finance a
clean-up.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
      In 1964, Marshall McLuhan pointed out that new technologies,
such as television and the computer, have changed our vision of the
world.  He wrote describing his new paradigm:
<P>
      <UL>After three thousand years of explosion, by means of
      fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the Western world
      is imploding.  Today, after more than a century of electric
      technology, we have extended our central nervous system
      itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time
      as far as our planet is concerned.  Rapidly, we approach
      the final phase of the extension of man -- the
      technological simulation of consciousness, when the
      creative process of knowing will be collectively and
      corporately extended to the whole of human society.</UL>
<P>
      McLuhan's vision came to be known as the global village; a
result of his equation, in its own way as revolutionary as Albert
Einstein's E=MC2, that "the medium is the message."  McLuhan's insight
was that media are the extension of the human nervous system, and "the
personal and social consequences of any medium result from the new
scale that is introduced into our affairs... by any new technology."
<P>
      One of the most important writers to follow McLuhan has been
George Gilder.  His Life After Television, significantly distributed
in "The Larger Agenda" series by Whittle Direct Books in 1990, argued
that "television, in technical terms, was dead."  Gilder counselled
against following the Japanese model of government bureaucracies and
business consortia because large, centralized organizations were an
outdated relic of obsolete technologies -- dating from the Industrial
Revolution of the 19th Century.
<P>
      With the introduction of the micro-chip, Gilder argued
"Intelligence could move from the broadcast station into inexpensive,
home-based personal computers.... The choices now made by broadcasters
at an event could be made at home by a viewer's hand-held remote
control."  The entire existing terrestrial broadcast system became
outdated, in Gilder's words, "as passe as last century's ice-box and
ice wagon."  According to Gilder, the result will be enhanced
individualism, strengthening democracy and capitalism all around the
world.  In Gilder's view, all networks are the equivalent of ice
companies doomed by the invention of refrigeration.
<P>
      Such an individualism means that the era of television as a
purely mass medium is over, to be replaced by an electronic
marketplace entered through the "telecomputer."  This marketplace will
be accessible through fiber optic cables and digital compression. 
Gilder argues such an "electronic town hall" (to borrow from Ross
Perot or Heritage's own new service) will "liberate our imaginations
from programs regulated by bureaucrats chosen by a small elite of
broadcasting professionals and governed by the need to target the
lowest common denominators of public interests," or in the case of
PBS, by political considerations.
<P>
      Gilder uses the metaphor of the magazine business, with dozens
of special interest publications for every taste, as his vision for
the micro-chip age, which is now upon us.
<P>
      Critic David Marc argues that we don't even have to wait for the
telecomputer -- that cable and satellite broadcasting, along with the
home-video cassette, have already rendered mass media as a thing of
the past.  In Demographic Vistas, he remarks:
<P>
      <UL>As NBC, CBS, ABC, and PBS and big-city independents are
      joined by HBO, ESPN, A&E, CBN, WHT, USA, CNN and the rest
      yet to come in the alphabet soup of the cable converter,
      the forty years or so during which scores of millions of
      people watched the same TV shows day in and day out are
      likely to be remembered as a quaint, naive period.  Cable
      innovations will allow the demographer marketeers to
      decentralize structure and even to isolate and attack
      pockets of aesthetic resistance (the highly educated are
      among the early, prominent target groups).</UL>
<P>
      So McLuhan, Gilder, and Marc all argue that the transformation
of technology has changed our way of life irrevocably, and that the
approaches of the past will be of little help in the future.  In this
sense they have an affinity with Jacques Ellul, who argues in The
Technological System that "the human being who uses technology today
is by that very fact the human being who serves it.  And conversely,
only the human being who serves technology is truly able to use it." 
At a crucial moment, then, one might ask "not what your technology can
do for you, but what you can do for your technology."  And it is with
this constrained vision that I would like to discuss the role of
public television on the cultural marketplace after privatization.

<P>
A SEA CHANGE
<P>
      The current debate over public television is not occurring in
isolation.  The present moment is one of tremendous change in the
communications industry and show-business, as the impact of the events
of the 1980s is beginning to be felt.
<P>
      In Europe, the fall of Communism has resulted in an explosion of
private media outlets, and a revolution in the relationship between
broadcasters and the marketplace.  I recently returned from MIP, the
international TV program market in Cannes, where I attended a press
conference on the privatization of Russian television, and heard a
pitch on why a network buy in Russia now was a bargain.  At the same
time, the European Community is preparing to increase production of
television, much of it in English, designed for sale to the American
market.  And in France there are rumors that Antenne 2, the second
public channel, will be sold off to private investors before the next
national elections.  Already, Canal, Plus, a private wireless cable
channel, is the most successful station in Europe, and owns Carolco
pictures, which produced both Basic Instinct and JFK.  TF-1
successfully drove its competitor, le Cinq, off the air -- with a
little help from the French government, which plans to split its
franchise between a French-German cultural channel and Jacques Lang's
dream of a national MTV for France.
<P>
      In England, the BBC announced a joint venture with Thames
Television on a new satellite channel featuring shows from their tape
libraries -- fully financed by advertising.  This is a dramatic change
for the BBC, and was announced only days after the victory of John
Major and the Conservatives.  The BBC also has started a service to
Asia, again with advertising on its satellite feed.  Thus, even Auntie
Bee is moving into the marketplace with surprising alacrity.
<P>
      Here in the United States there is evidence of dramatic change
in telecommunications.  In addition to the CPB reauthorization still
pending in the Senate, there remains serious legislation to re-
regulate the cable industry; to decide on the entry of telephone
companies into competition with the networks; and to set up a new
satellite service dedicated to educational use called EDSAT.  The
networks are pressing for an end to Fin/Syn.  In addition, the
competing HDTV suppliers have pooled their resources.  Each of these
events alone is a small sign of the sea change in broadcasting.  Put
together, they mark the most significant shift since the Nixon
Administration's decisions of Financial Interest in Syndication,
Prime-Time Access, satellites, and cable entry.  It is also rumored
that Clayton Yeutter has set up a telecommunications policy working
group in the White House, which indicates just how important these
matters will be in the coming months and years.  The tectonic plates
are clearly shifting, and the fight over the public broadcasting bill
is now seen to be a volcano erupting on a fault line, a fault line
caused by the irresistible force of market pressures on a highly
regulated industry.  The immense demand can no longer be met by
government sanctioned gatekeepers extracting monopoly rents.
<P>
      Some measure of the transformation in broadcasting can be seen
in viewing statistics.  In 1983-1984, the networks had a 69 share,
independent broadcasters a 19 share, PBS a 3 share, basic cable a 9
share, and pay cable a 5 share.  Six years later, the numbers had
shifted dramatically.  In 1990-1991, the networks were down sixteen
points, to a 53 share, independents up slightly to a 21 share, and
basic cable up fifteen points to a 24 share.  Meanwhile, PBS remained
static at a 3 share, which meant its core of loyal viewers were not
switching, but neither were they getting new audiences.  Another set
of statistics, from Entertainment Weekly, actually reported PBS
audiences went down by 12 percent in 1990-1991.  In that same period,
cable stations doubled their expenditures on programming from $1.74
billion to $3.46 billion, some three times the annual budget for
public broadcasting.  Given these statistics, how can public
broadcasting cope with the seismic changes in their universe?  Harold
Vogel points out in his book Entertainment Industry Economics that
Direct Broadcast Satellite, Microwave Multi-point Distribution of
Signals, Small Master Antenna Television, and subscription television
will all be growth technologies challenging cable's dominance, as well
as the current share of the networks and PBS.  He notes "technological
development has been the driving force behind the growth of the
entertainment industries."  Vogel further notes that in a competitive
environment, small entrepreneurs (not established) thrive because of
the inherent non-standardization and novelty required.  Vogel says
creative works "are uniquely produced and are normally originated by
individuals working alone or in small groups, and not by giant
corporate committees.  One can become rich and famous as a direct
result of one's own creative efforts."
<P>
      How can public broadcasting provide an environment which
attracts such creative entrepreneurs?  Only by transforming the system
into one which rewards individualistic impresarios rather than
bureaucratic operators.
<P>

CREATIVE COMPETITION
<P>
      This competition means that government funding, with its
strings, serves to stunt the growth of public broadcasting.  Richard
Blum and Richard Lindheim predict that pay-per-view will become an
increasingly competitive source of programming in the 1990s, in their
book Primetime Network Television Programming.  In that book, they
point out that the creative process is an extremely personal one.  The
presentation begins with an oval "pitch" explaining a series idea. 
The written presentation is usually not shown to the network, unless
there is a complication.  The most important factor is showmanship. 
They add:  "A number of key ingredients are necessary for a successful
presentation.  Among them are honest enthusiasm, abundance of detail,
humor, conviction, and adaptability."  Once the idea is accepted, the
written concept is purchased.  As the authors point out, it "often
sounds like a TV guide marketing blurb."  They reprint the one-
paragraph concept for Murder She Wrote as follows:
<P>
      <UL>Angela Lansbury stars as a celebrated mystery writer,
      Jessica Fletcher, whose penchant for crime-solving
      invariably involves her in often bizarre and always
      colorful escapades.  Once a contented widow from a small
      town in Maine, Jessica has found fame, as well as
      adventure, by turning her avocational scribblings into a
      lucrative new career.  A star-studded cast and an endless
      chain of nieces and nephews will join her as she solves the
      most intriguing of crimes with the most eccentric of
      methods.</UL>
<P>
      In contrast to the highly personal creative process surrounding
commercial programming, because of its reliance on tax dollars today
public broadcasting operates much more like a government bureaucracy. 
According to 1988 congressional testimony from Fred Wiseman, the
system is a "mess."  He added, "most competent professionals would not
consider working in public television in its present form."  Yet, so
long as public broadcasting is accountable for federal tax dollars it
will rightfully be hamstrung by administrative procedures inimical to
the creative spirit, designed for civil service priorities.  Evidence
for this can be seen in the lack of successful new series on PBS
prime-time schedules, even a follow-up to General Motors' The Civil
War.  Evidence can also be found in P.J.  O'Rourke's description of
bureaucracy.  He says "the actual work of government is too
unglamorous for the people who govern us to do.  Important elected
office-holders and high appointed officials create bureaucratic
departments to perform the humdrum tasks of national supervision. 
Government proposes, bureaucracy disposes.  And the bureaucracy must
dispose of government proposals by dumping them on us."
<P>
      Such a system rewards the bureaucratic mind, not the creative
and glamorous spirit.  It is a fact that even Norman Lear, one of the
most successful producers in Hollywood and certainly a bona fide
liberal, was unable to get his American Writer's Theatre -- which
would have featured adaptations of classic American authors -- through
the PBS and CPB maze.  It is not surprising, as Jonathan W.  Emord has
shown in his book Freedom, Technology and The First Amendment.  "The
normal functioning of the free speech and press models is possible
only in the absence of government regulation."  But federal tax
dollars carry federal strings.  Therefore, for public broadcasting to
be free and creative, it must be truly independent -- and that means
financially private -- in order to thrive.
<P>
      How is this to take place?  The answer lies in the rich
potential of the ancillary revenues from public broadcasting.  As has
been shown by the success of ventures such as Bill Kling's $77,000,000
Minnesota Public Radio catalogs, or Ken Burns's and Bill Moyers's
video and book tie-ins, or Sesame Street's licensing of $1 billion
worth of merchandise world-wide, there are substantial revenues to be
earned in the public broadcasting aftermarkets.
<P>
      With a real, bottom line after privatization, public
broadcasters will be encouraged to make deals so that the profits from
ancillary income go directly to finance the creation of new
programming.  This will be true for stations as well.  The copyrights
for public broadcasting productions would be the motor of this
prosperity.  Combined with donations, underwriting, and increased
corporate support, these sums will more than make up for the trade-off
in federal funds.  Such a self-supporting public broadcasting system
could be run on either a non-profit or a for-profit basis.  If non-
profit, the model might be The National Geographic Society.  With
10,000,000 members -- twice as many as public broadcasting -- National
Geographic runs $450,000,000 of cultural and educational programs each
year -- including two TV series, a magazine, the visitor center, and
numerous expeditions and publications.  Yet, it receives no direct tax
dollars, unlike the present CPB.
<P>
      Or CPB could go for-profit as a publicly held and publicly
traded corporation, receiving its capital from the marketplace instead
of the taxpayer.  This would still leave the local stations untouched,
free to operate as they have been doing.
<P>
      But instead of receiving community service grants as they now
do, local stations and other recipients would have to bargain over the
terms of contracts with a partner who had a bottom line to meet.  This
would enforce fiscal discipline on the entire system, and perhaps
encourage public television stations to increase their audiences.  It
would create incentives to reach viewers.  Share holders could
participate proudly in any profits, having converted charity to an
investment.
<P>
      The non-profit model is already successful for Children's
Television Workshop, grossing $100 million annually.  The for-profit
model also exists in production companies such as Ken Burns's
Florentine Films and Bill Moyers' Public Affairs Television.
<P>
      All of them are already truly thriving in the cultural
marketplace, selling books, records, and videocassettes, among other
items.  There is no reason their successes could not be duplicated in
such a way that contribute directly to the system instead of
extracting profit (and "non-profit") from the system.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
      By entering the cultural marketplace as a truly private entity
and directly competing with new services, and by using its strongest
programming to support new products, Public Television has every
opportunity to grow and prosper in the multi-channel marketplace.  For
in addition to all its tangible assets, Public Television enjoys
another benefit -- the good will engendered by its long established
reputation for quality educational and cultural programming.  It is a
blue-ribbon name, on which one cannot even place a dollar estimate. 
With the proper marketing strategy, and a willingness to go head-to-
head in competition, there can be no doubt but that PBS could
establish itself in the market niche of the "Tiffany" service by the
end of the 1990s, and Tiffany's is a very successful shop.
<P>
      Without the stifling influence of the government bureaucracy
which goes with its congressional appropriation, a liberated CPB will
be free to bring far more of the finest in arts, education, and
culture to viewers like you, at no cost to the taxpayer.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
      Americans overwhelmingly believe that parents know best how to
raise young children. This is confirmed in poll after poll. ("For
Better or Worse, Results from a Newsweek Gallup poll, 1989," Newsweek,
Special Issue on Children, Summer 1990, p. 18.) Experts, too, agree
that the family home is the optimum setting for early childhood
development.
<P>
      Yet the federal government ignores this definitive data. In
fact, the federal government is greatly increasing its efforts to take
very young children out of their homes and put them, for part of the
day or all day, into government-funded institutions. Washington is
even launching a campaign to persuade parents to part with their sons
and daughters at ever earlier ages. 
<P>
      These actions amount to a federal family policy that undermines
families. And this policy is becoming more expansive, aggressive, and
expensive. Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Activists are seeking to increase funding beyond the $23.5
      billion already authorized for child care and early education
      programs for 1991-1995. The total includes $4.5 billion to set
      up child care bureaucracies at the state level. 
<P>
      George Bush is asking for a nearly $700 million increase in the
      fiscal 1992 federal budget for Project Head Start, already the
      largest federally funded early childhood development program.
      The program would cost just over $2 billion.
<P>
      The Bush Administration wants to spend $60 million in fiscal
      1992 on Even Start, a Department of Education program similar to
      Head Start. The budget request is a 200 percent increase over
      fiscal 1990 and a 21 percent hike over fiscal 1991.
<P>
      A congressionally appointed, taxpayer-funded panel is
      considering ways to conduct national academic testing of 3-year-
      olds.
<P>
      A taxpayer-financed study for the Department of Education
      pleads the case for a federally directed, federally subsidized
      system of national child care standards and early childhood
      education services. The Department is listening to no opposing
      views.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Despite a glaring lack of scientific evidence that early
childhood programs help children now or in the future, as their
sponsors claim, the federal government is spending ever more
taxpayers' money on them.
<P>
      To be sure, for severely disadvantaged children, Head Start and
other programs initially improve academic performance. But studies
show that the impact does not endure for more than a year or two.
Despite this, Head Start is often touted as a "magic bullet" that
helps poor children succeed in school. Based on the available
evidence, Head Start may deserve support as a welfare program
providing nutrition and care for poor children, but not as an
educational jump start. 
<P>
      Says J. Craig Peery, professor of human development at Brigham
Young University and the author of the 1981 Project Head Start
reauthorization bill: "I think we know a lot about early childhood
education -- and it doesn't work." (Telephone interview, March 7,
1991.) 
<P>
      Potentially Harmful. Many experts feel that early education that
emphasizes performance is not only not beneficial but potentially
harmful. Says pediatrician and author Benjamin Spock: "When we
instruct children in academic subjects, or in swimming, gymnastics, or
ballet, at too early an age, we miseducate them; we put them at risk
for short-term stress and long-term personality damage for no useful
purpose. There is no evidence that such early instruction has lasting
benefits, and considerable evidence that it can do lasting harm."
(Quoted in David Elkind, Miseducation, Preschoolers at Risk (New York:
Alfred A. Knopf, 1988), p. 4.) 
<P>
      Aside from one small study that finds significant long-term
gains, even the most positive analyses of early childhood programs
acknowledge few lasting effects. Indeed, the most comprehensive Head
Start study compares school testing of Head Start children with those
not enrolled and concludes: "by the end of the second year there are
no educationally meaningful differences." (Executive Summary, The
Impact of Head Start on Children, Families and Communities, Head Start
Evaluation, Synthesis and Utilization Project, U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, June 1985, p. 6.) 
<P>
      Out-of-Home Problems. In contrast, research shows that children
in out-of-home programs for extensive periods tend to be more
aggressive, have more psychological problems, favor peer groups over
parental authority and get into more fights than home-reared children.
(Nicholas Zill, Developmental, Learning and Emotional Problems: Health
of Our Nation's Children, cited in "Family-Induced Disturbances Affect
One in Five Children," Education Daily, Vol. 23, No. 238, December 11,
1990, p. 3. Also, Deborah Vandell and Mary Corasaniti and others cited
by J. Craig Peery in "Children At Risk: The Case Against Day Care,"
The Family in America, Rockford Institute, February 1991.) Young
children are also more likely to contract serious illnesses in
institutional settings. (Reed Bell, "Health Risks From Daycare
Diseases," in Phyllis Schlafly, ed. Who Will Rock the Cradle?, Two
Conferences on Childcare (Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense
Fund, 1981), pps. 115-122.) 
<P>
      Even Yale psychologist Edward F. Zigler, widely known as the
foremost proponent of early childhood development programs, warns that
such programs may not be suitable for all children: "There is a large
body of evidence indicating that there is little if anything to be
gained by exposing middle-class children to early education." (Edward
F. Zigler, "Formal Schooling for Four-Year-Olds? No" in Sharon L.
Kagan and Edward F. Zigler, eds., Early Schooling (New Haven: Yale
University Press, 1987), p. 30.) He adds: "We must listen to those
families who neither want nor need their young children placed in
preschool .... whenever the family situation permits it, the best
place for a preschool child is often at home." (Zigler, op. cit., p.
34.)
<P>
      Warning Bells. The virtual absence of proof that programs have
long-term benefits and growing evidence that children in institutional
settings are at risk should ring warning bells in Washington. It
should make the federal government proceed with caution before funding
existing and new programs for young children -- until research proves
that such programs not only do not harm children but significantly
help them. 
<P>
      Yet this evidence routinely is ignored at the Departments of
Education and Health and Human Services, and sometimes even at the
White House. Ignored too is the fact that the most important cultural
problem facing America is dysfunctional families -- the families in
which children are most often at risk.
<P>
      What is puzzling is that some leading officials rhetorically
admit that the well-being of American families is the key to a healthy
society, even while the agencies run by these officials pay scant heed
to the rhetoric. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human
Services, earlier this month told the annual legislative conference of
the National League of Cities: "So many of our problems -- drug and
alcohol abuse, the spread of AIDS, teen pregnancy, infant mortality,
youth homicide, among others -- reflect the personal isolation,
alienation and despair that follow from the widespread erosion of
family and community." (Paul Taylor, "Family Seen as Key to Aiding
Children," The Washington Post, March 11, 1991, p A-5.) Adds
Minneapolis Mayor Donald M. Fraser: "We know we have a welfare system
that discourages marriage.... we have a [federal] public policy that
is designed to destroy families and nobody talks about it." (Ibid.)
<P>
      Sullivan, a Republican, and Fraser, a Democrat, both call for
the abolition of federal programs that weaken families. (Both men,
however, support expansion of Head Start. Sullivan calls it a "middle
ground" that shores up families without supplanting them.) This call
merits very broad support. To succeed, it requires a strategy whose
first steps include:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
1)    Ending the funding of all early childhood education programs
      except those for the poor. 
<P>
2)    Supporting research into early education for disadvantaged
      children to determine if there is a model that works and can be
      replicated. Such efforts should target only severely
      disadvantaged children, follow methods for which there is some
      evidence of success, and use a controlled experiment format.
<P>
3)    Evaluating independently all existing federally subsidized early
      childhood education programs. Conflicts of interest should
      preclude bureaucracies that administer programs from evaluating
      their effectiveness. 
<P>
4)    Expanding the use of vouchers or tax credits to allow parents to
      choose the best education and care for their children. Parental
      involvement should be a paramount consideration in any program.
      Early childhood education may indeed be worthwhile for some
      disadvantaged children, but studies indicate parental
      involvement with children is the key developmental factor.
<P>
5)    Reducing federally imposed financial burdens on the family. In
      1948, a family of four of median income paid 2 percent of its
      income to federal taxes. This year, that family pays 24 percent
      in federal taxes in addition to state, local, and excise taxes.
      (Robert Rector, "Fourteen Myths About Families and Child Care,"
      Harvard Journal on Legislation, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Summer 1989), p.
      542.) Some ways to aid families include: increasing the personal
      exemption for dependents, increasing the earned income tax
      credit and extending it to more families, and redesigning
      welfare programs to encourage fatherhood, not father
      abandonment. Minnesota, for instance, has waived welfare rules
      that have been driving fathers out of the house.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> THE FEDERAL ROLE</B>
<P>
      Despite lack of evidence that early childhood programs
substantially benefit children, the U.S. government agencies actively
promote these programs in several ways.
<P>
* The Tax Credit for Dependent Care allows parents to deduct from
their gross income a portion of child care expenses on their federal
returns. The deductions totalled $3.895 billion in fiscal 1990 and are
projected to total $4.395 billion in fiscal 1992. (Telephone interview
with Terry Harrow, legislative branch director for Human Development
Resources, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, March 12,
1991.) The program has the merit of giving parents economic assistance
to choose the kind of child care they want, including religious-
affiliated facilities. The trouble is that the program discriminates
against parents caring for children at home. In effect, the government
says: "If you leave your child with someone other than one of the
parents (or grandparents, or aunts, or neighbors), you get a tax
break."
<P>
* Child care provisions in the 1991 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Bill
will cost an estimated $23.6 billion over five years for several
programs. (Other provisions are: a Child Health Insurance Credit. This
$5.2-billion program assists families in buying health insurance for
children. In 1994 the maximum credit will be $483. A "Wee Tots"
Supplemental Tax Credit. This $700 million program gives families with
a child under one year a supplemental credit or allows them to choose
the Dependent Care Tax Credit. By 1994, the "Wee Tot" maximum credit
will be $403.) Among them: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1)    The Earned Income Tax Credit. Projected to reduce federal tax
      revenues by $12.4 billion over five years, this gives a small
      measure of tax relief (a direct refund of up to a maximum of
      $953) to poor families with children. 
<P>
2)    Child Care and Development Block Grant. Estimated to cost $4.45
      billion over five years, this gives money to states based on the
      number of low-income children in the state under age five. Some
      75 percent of the money can be used for services to children;
      the other 25 percent is targeted for quality control, early
      childhood programs, and day care for latch-key children. Because
      of fuzzy wording, the money for children's services could be
      siphoned into campaigns for a child care bureaucracy. 
<P>
3)    Title IV Family Support Ways and Means Grant. Allocating $1.5
      billion over five years, this gives money to poor working
      families for child care to keep parents off welfare rolls. 
<P>
4)    Standards and Training Ways and Means Grant. At a cost of $250
      million, this will help states improve standards for child care,
      monitor compliance, and provide training for child care
      providers.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> Head Start</B>
<P>
      The largest federally funded early childhood development program
is Head Start. Begun in 1965 as part of Lyndon Johnson's War on
Poverty, Head Start is a comprehensive early childhood development
program providing children ages 3 to 5 from low-income families with
educational, social, medical, dental, nutritional, and mental health
services. (Head Start: A Child Development Program, pamphlet, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 1990, p. 2.) In the past
quarter-century, more than 11 million children have been Head Start
clients. Beginning with a summer-only enrollment of 561,000 and a
budget of $96.4 million (Project Head Start Statistical Fact Sheet,
January 1990, p. 2.) the program grew rapidly. By 1966 the budget was
$198.9 million, enrollment rose to 733,000, and the program expanded
to full-day. (Ibid.) In 1982, when seasonal programs were replaced by
year-round-only services, 395,800 children were enrolled in the
program, which had a budget of $911.7 million. (Ibid.) During the 1990
school year, more than 488,000 children were enrolled at a estimated
average cost of $2,767 per child (Ibid., pp. 1,2.) while the budget
grew to $1.386 billion. The program has a paid staff of 79,549, plus
615,000 volunteers. (Ibid., pp. 2,3.)    Some 54 percent of Head Start
families are headed by a single parent. Handicapped children account
for 13.5 percent of enrollees. Up to 10 percent of Head Start slots
can be filled by children not deemed at risk. 
<P>
      Head Start gives children hot meals, comprehensive health care
including dental treatment, and social activities. Parents are offered
positions on policy-making boards, workshops on child care and
nutrition, and training for Head Start jobs. (Serving the Nation's
Children and Families, Administration for Children, Youth and
Families, Department of Health and Human Services, undated, p. 11.) 
<P>
      Modest Success. Head Start's lack of quantifiable success for
long-term effects does not mean that it has not done any good; some
poor children get meals and health care that they might not otherwise
receive; the program has reduced the number of poor children
misdiagnosed as retarded, and some studies indicate improvement in
school attendance, academic performance and IQ test results for the
first year or two. There is, moreover, anecdotal evidence of
individual successes. Some of Head Start's operating premises --
parental involvement, self-help emphasis, local control -- are an
improvement over those of typically top-heavy bureaucratic welfare
agencies. 
<P>
      Good Intentions. While Head Start rightly claims modest success
in aiding some disadvantaged youngsters, the program mainly thrives on
good intentions. The most comprehensive study of Head Start was
completed in 1984. Among its most important findings: short-term gains
fade within a couple of years. (R. H. McKey, et al. , The Impact of
Head Start on Children, Families and Communities, 1985, cited in Ron
Haskins, "Beyond Metaphor, The Efficacy of Early Childhood Education,"
American Psychologist, February 1989, pp. 274-281.) Says Ron Haskins,
a developmental psychologist and welfare analyst for the House
Committee on Ways and Means: "Results from Head Start projects are
uncertain for the special education effects, and there is virtually no
evidence [that Head Start reduces] teen pregnancy, crime, welfare, or
unemployment." ( Haskins, op. cit., p.279.)   
<P>
      No major studies of Head Start have been released since 1985,
and none are underway, according to Esther Kresh, a senior researcher
at Head Start. Observes Kresh, who favors more studies into Head
Start's effectiveness: "There isn't anything going on now. The whole
body of research was in the early days." (Telephone interview, March
8, 1991.) Kresh adds that "the real study has never been done" on Head
Start. As a Head Start proponent, she believes that such a study would
reveal that the program works, although not to everyone's
satisfaction. For one thing, the program keeps changing. Says Kresh:
"It's gone from being a child-development program to a full-family
development program." (Interview, op. cit.)
<P>
      No Panacea. A Head Start advisory panel last year recommended
studies "to identify early and intermediate outcomes" and factors
outside the program that affect children's later chances for success,
such as family life and schooling. (Head Start Research and
Evaluation: A Blueprint for the Future. Recommendations of the
Advisory Panel for the Head Start Evaluation Design Project,
Department of Health and Human Services, September 1990, p. 4.) The
report affirms agency officials' belief in the success of other child
development programs, but cautions that "policymakers and the general
public should not be oversold that early education and intervention
programs such as Head Start, even when implemented in a high-quality
fashion, are some kind of panacea that succeed even in the absence of
appropriate ongoing child and family support." ( Op. cit., p. 14.) 
<P>
      Head Start lacks a serious benefit-cost analysis, which is a
method of expressing costs and benefits in dollars and comparing them.
"Unfortunately, there are few benefit-cost studies of early childhood
education," says Ways and Means Committee welfare analyst Haskins.
"....The only thorough benefit-cost studies published to date were
performed on one project -- the Perry Preschool program." (Haskins,
op. cit., p. 279.) And, as Haskins emphasizes, "Perry is not Head
Start." (Telephone interview, March 19, 1991.)
<P>
      To sum: Hard evidence is lacking for claims by Head Start
proponents. As such, before Washington spends more taxpayer money on
Head Start, the program should be researched thoroughly. Without
conclusive evidence of lasting benefits, Head Start should not be
expanded, nor should similar programs such as Even Start. 
<P>
<B> Even Start</B>
<P>
      A little-known program, Even Start was begun in 1989. Now the
U.S. Department of Education is seeking $60 million in the fiscal 1992
federal budget for Even Start, almost triple its fiscal 1991 outlay.
Even Start's purpose, as stated in the Federal Register, is to assist
eligible local educational agencies in "providing family-centered
education projects to help parents become full partners in the
education of their children, to assist children in reaching their full
potential as learners, and to provide literacy training for their
parents." (Federal Register, Vol. 56, No. 23 (February 4, 1991), p.
4390.) Although Head Start also has parent education, Even Start
requires it. Even Start is home-based, and enrolls children aged 1
through 7; Head Start is for children ages 3 to 5 and is based in
classrooms.
<P>
      To enroll in Even Start, parents must reside in a poor area and
be eligible for adult education assistance programs. Even Start
requires parent involvement in all activities and stresses adult
literacy, parenting skills, and parent-child interaction. Asked to
compare Head Start and Even Start, Tisch Rennings, Even Start
education program specialist at the Department of Education, told a
Heritage Foundation researcher: "There really isn't any difference.
It's essentially funding for the [early childhood] programs from a
different source." (Telephone interview, February 26, 1991.) There are
no studies to date on Even Start. 
<P>
<B> The Early Education Lobby</B>
<P>
      Taxpayers are funding a campaign to increase federal support of
early childhood development programs. One of these efforts is
"Excellence in Early Childhood Education: Defining Characteristics and
Next-Decade Strategies," a pamphlet published by the Department of
Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement. It is
written by Sharon L. Kagan, associate director of the Bush Center in
Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University. She is active
in child care lobbying organizations like the Child Care Action
Network, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Association for
the Education of Young Children. 
<P>
      "Excellence in Early Childhood Education" calls for more federal
oversight, national standards, and more federal subsidies to child
care professionals. The 29-page essay, part of a four-part series of
"Public Policy Perspectives," calls for, among other things, a broad
campaign to persuade Americans that "early care and education programs
are now a permanent part of the social landscape." (Sharon Kagan,
"Excellence in Early Childhood Education: Defining Characteristics and
Next-Decade Strategies," Office of Educational Research and
Improvement, U.S. Department of Education, July 1990, p. 21.) By
publishing this essay, the Department of Education is lobbying for
expansion of programs for which there is little proof of
effectiveness.
<P>
      Kagan consistently argues for a larger federal role in early
childhood development. To do this, she wants "a single agency at the
Federal level." (Kagan, op. cit., p. 4.) Her essay includes no dissent
from the view that early childhood programs are effective, essential,
and should be brought under a federal umbrella. Parental rights
receive only lip service. The pamphlets, which cost $4,080 to print,
plus a $2,500 fee for Kagan, (Telephone interview March 18, 1991, with
Lewis Walker, chief of the Educational Information branch of the
Office of Educational Research and Improvement, Department of
Education.) were distributed to about 4,000 educators and policy
makers across the country. Although the pamphlet contains the caveat
that it "does not necessarily represent positions or policies of the
U.S. Department of Education, and no official endorsement should be
inferred," the Department's blessing is clearly implied. Indeed, the
Department has issued no companion publication with opposing views. 
<P>
<B> National Test For 3-Year-Olds</B>
<P>
      A federal panel is exploring ways to test children as young as
age 3 to determine "the skills and attitudes of the school-entering
population." ("Congressional Panel Examines Testing Three-Year-Olds,"
Education Daily, December 11, 1990, p. 2.) Yet kindergarten begins for
most children at age 5 or 6. Testing children at age 3 serves no
purpose other than to provide statistics that can be used to marshall
support for schooling at earlier ages.
<P>
      The Special Study Panel on Education Indicators was mandated in
the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary-Secondary School Improvement Act in
1988. Last December in a preliminary draft of a report to be released
this June, the panel recommended national testing of 3-year-olds. Says
panel chairman Alan Morgan, who is New Mexico's state school
superintendent: "We won't break the cycle of poverty unless we
intervene early." (Ibid.) He maintains that testing 3-year-olds "will
allow us to determine the sources of education inequities near their
roots, rather than after children have already spent time in
elementary school." (Ibid.)    The test, whose format is still under
study but which one panelist calls "a Pampers SAT," would be
expensive, requiring one-on-one sessions with "an adult trained in
early-childhood development." (Ibid.) 
<P>
      Such a testing program could be the first step in the formation
of compulsory schooling for very young children. 
<P>
<B> WHY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION?</B>
<P>
      "Early childhood education" generally refers to developmental
programs designed for 3- to 5-year-olds. Some experts prefer the term
"early childhood development" because they fear children might be
harmed by undue academic pressures. 
<P>
      Programs vary widely, from custodial care, which is basically
baby-sitting, to highly structured curriculums. Children spend as
little as a couple of hours a week at a care facility or as much as
ten hours a day, five days a week. 
<P>
      The problem is not the concept of preschools. Even families with
one full-time parent often enroll young children in nursery schools
two or three mornings a week for social activities and to give tired
parents a short break. 
<P>
      The problem is that federally funded programs are growing
rapidly despite scant evidence that they work. Says developmental
psychologist Peery: "Nobody is doing any critical thinking. It's a
mantra now." (Telephone interview, March 7, 1991.)
<P>
      In the mid-1970s, several model education programs were
organized into a consortium study, whose findings were released in
1982. (Irving Lazar, et al., Lasting Effects of Early Education: A
Report from the Consortium for Longitudinal Studies, Monographs of the
Society for Research in Child Development, 47, 2-3 Serial No. 195,
1982, cited in Haskins, op. cit., p. 274-282.) With the exception of a
study of the Perry Preschool Program, the analyses, taken as a whole,
reported substantial initial gains in children's cognitive
performances, followed by declines within a year or two, with
inconclusive evidence about long-term effects. Perry Preschool, which
early education proponents cite frequently as proof that such programs
work, is the only program for which studies report dramatic long-term
results. Neither the Perry Preschool study, however, nor the programs
in the consortium were representative of most preschools. Notes
welfare analyst Haskins: "These intervention programs were conducted
under ideal circumstances: Skilled researchers, capable staffs, ample
budgets... it seems unwise to claim that the benefits produced by such
exemplary programs would necessarily be produced by ordinary preschool
programs conducted in communities across the United States." (Haskins,
op. cit., p. 277.) Head Start, on the other hand, he adds, "can be
offered as a close approximation of what could be expected from
universal preschool education for poor children." (Ibid.)
<P>
      In recent years, interest in early childhood education has
increased for several reasons:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1)    America's failing educational system. Test scores are still
      falling, dropout rates are high, especially among the poor, and
      literacy skills are declining, despite the highest level of
      public spending on education in American history. Some people
      fear that America's children will grow up unable to compete in a
      global economy. 
<P>
2)    A plethora of seemingly intractable social problems,
      particularly in America's inner cities. Early intervention is
      seen as a way to equip children with skills that will allow them
      to succeed in school and later in life.
<P>
3)    The entry of many women into the workforce since the 1960s,
      which has created a demand for non-maternal child care. Just as
      it would be unreasonable to fashion a federal policy to induce
      all mothers to stay at home, it is just as unreasonable to
      induce all children into day care, even that which emphasizes
      early childhood education. As Heritage Foundation family policy
      analyst Rector writes in the Harvard Journal on Legislation: "We
      must ask whether government policy should actively discourage
      the home rearing of children." (Rector, op. cit., p. 541.)
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> UNEXAMINED ASSUMPTIONS</B>
<P>
      To justify the drive for more federal spending on programs,
early childhood advocates make several claims, among them:
<P>
CLAIM #1: 
<P>      Traditional child-rearing, that is, family life, is "obsolete"
or a mere idealization. "Less than 10 percent of families" now fit the
Ozzie and Harriet model, says Representative Patricia Schroeder, the
Colorado Democrat who has just assumed chairmanship of the House
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. (Cited in David
Blankenhorn, "Ozzie and Harriet: Have Reports of Their Death Been
Greatly Exaggerated?" Institute for American Values, Family Affairs,
Vol. 2, No. 2-3 (Summer/Fall, 1989), p. 10.) Another typical comment
is found in a report funded by a grant from the Department of
Education: "[Norman] Rockwell's Portrait of American Family Is
Changing: Only 4-7 percent of American families have an employed
father, full-time homemaker mother, and two children." (National
Commission on Working Women, cited in Resegregation of Public Schools:
The Third Generation, Network of Regional Desegregation Assistance
Centers, June 1989, p. 40. ) 
<P>
REALITY: 
  <P>    The citations above are very misleading. For one thing, only
families with two children are counted. If a family has one child, or
three or more, it is not counted as a "traditional" family, even if
the family has an employed father and a full-time homemaker mother.
Not counted also are families in which the mother is employed part-
time, even if only during the summer, or is employed full-time for
only part of the year, or families with unemployed fathers. For
another thing, the term "families" is misused; the data really count
"households." This includes college students, empty nesters with grown
children, childless single adults, and others who are in different
categories entirely. 
<P>
      The latest data from the U.S. Labor Department and the Census
Bureau clearly show that two-thirds of the nation's young children are
being raised at home, most by full-time mothers or mothers who are
employed only part-time. (Marital and Family Characteristics of the
Labor Force from the March 1990 Current Population Survey, U.S.
Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, October 1990, p. 4.)
Many women leave the labor force after the birth of a second child.
Some resume part-time or full-time jobs outside the home when their
children are older. More than one-third of mothers with children aged
6 to 13 are outside the labor force; half of mothers with children
aged 6 to 17 either are outside the labor force or are employed part-
time. (Ibid.) Of mothers employed full-time, most juggle child care
responsibilities with their husbands, other family members, or
neighbors. (Ibid.)
<P>
CLAIM #2: 
    <P>  Government programs for young children prevent social ills and
boost academic scores in later life.
<P>
REALITY: 
  <P>    The only longitudinal study to claim dramatic, long-term results
is of the Perry Preschool Program. Hundreds of other studies have
failed to duplicate the Perry findings. 
<P>
CLAIM #3: 
  <P>    A "crisis" in child care exists, so the federal government
should spend more on early childhood programs.
<P>
REALITY:
   <P>   Care facilities and programs for young children are expanding
rapidly. Between 1960 and 1986, the capacity of formal group care
centers in America increased from 141,000 to 2.1 million, while the
number of centers grew from 4,400 to 39,929 in the same period. Many
churches now operate full-day or part-day care centers. There even may
be an oversupply of day care. National day care chains such as Kinder-
Care Learning Centers, Inc. report average vacancy rates of 25
percent. (Rector, op. cit., p. 524.) The bulk of child care is being
done by parents, relatives, neighbors or by the more than 1.6 million
small, unlicensed day care providers. A 1988 Labor Department survey
finds "no evidence in support of the contention that there is a
general, national shortage of available care." (Child Care: A
Workforce Issue 10, Secretary's Task Force, U.S. Department of Labor,
1988, cited by Rector in ibid.)     
<P>
<B> The Perry Preschool Experiment</B>

   <P>   The most-often cited evidence that early childhood education
works are studies of the Perry Preschool Program, a project involving
123 black youths from poor families in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Begun in
1962, the study explores long-term effects of this high-quality early
childhood education program on 58 children. Another 65 children were
used as a control group; they did not attend preschool. The
researchers began tracking the 123 youngsters when they were three and
four years old.
<P>
      In 1984, when the subjects were between ages 19 and 24, studies
indicated long-term gains for the Perry pupils. According to the
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, which both designed the
preschool curriculum and conducted the study, the Perry pupils had
half the rate of teen-age pregnancy, a much lower rate of arrests and
juvenile delinquency and were half as likely to depend on welfare
assistance as the pupils in the control group. (John R.
Berrueta-Clement, et al., Changed Lives. The Effects of the Perry
Preschool Program on Youths Through Age 19 (Ypsilanti, Michigan:
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, 1984).) 
<P>
      Predicted Benefits. A Perry benefit-cost analysis reviewed such
factors as savings in public expenditures on education, welfare and
crime, and added taxes paid by later-employed Perry participants.
(W.S. Barnett, The Perry Preschool Program and its Long-Term Effects:
A Benefit-Cost Analysis, High/Scope Early Childhood Policy Papers, No.
2., Ypsilanti, Michigan, 1985. C.U. Weber, P.W. Foster and D.P.
Weikart, An Economic Analysis of the Perry Preschool Project
(Ypsilanti,Michigan:High/Scope, 1978). Both studies cited in Haskins,
op. cit., p 279.) Researchers concluded that "for each dollar invested
in the Perry Preschool Project, taxpayers receive a return of $1.46 by
the time participants are about 20 years of age. Predicted net
benefits over the lifetime of participants are even more substantial."
High/Scope researchers estimate that every dollar spent on preschool
education for children at risk saves $5.73 in projected future costs
to taxpayers.  (Ibid.)
<P>
      The Perry findings have been accepted widely as proof that
preschool programs, including Head Start, are good investments for
taxpayers and good for America's children. Calling the Perry program
"impressive," the House Ways and Means Committee's Haskins says well-
designed programs probably benefit some children, at least in the
short run. But he cautions: "It is unreasonable to expect that
extending preschool programs of the Head Start type to more low-income
children would produce benefits of the magnitude found in the Perry
project." (Haskins, op. cit., p. 280.) The problem with the Perry
study is that the Perry Preschool Program was far from typical. The
lessons learned from it thus have very limited applicability.
<P>
      Examples:

   <P>   Sample size. The Perry Preschool Program used a microscopic
segment of a narrowly defined population: poor, black children with
IQs between 61 and 81 in households in which a parent was home during
the day. (Zigler, op. cit., p. 30.)  Yale psychologist Zigler warns
that Perry "was not only unrepresentative of children in general;
there is some doubt that it was representative of even the bulk of
economically disadvantaged children.... it is even problematic as to
whether the sample was representative of low-income black children."
Other backers of early childhood education also say Perry's findings
need perspective. Notes Head Start's Kresh: "When they talk about a
difference in something happening, they're talking about 10 percent.
In a sample that small, they're talking about two or three kids."
(Telephone interview, March 8, 1991.) 
<P>
      Program Idiosyncrasies. Perry preschoolers were in a highly
controlled academic environment and were instructed by highly
professional educators. Perry pupils' parents were heavily involved,
and instructors visited pupils' homes each week. Few programs
duplicate such conditions, and even those that are similar have not
reproduced Perry's successes. 
<P>
      Conflicts of Interest. Studies of the Perry Program were
conducted by the same people who designed and administered the
project. High/Scope researchers have a professional and economic stake
in the program's success, including the marketing of early childhood
education program material. Such conflicts of interest prevent
High/Scope researchers, even with pure intentions, from being
objective observers. In High Scope Resource magazine, High/Scope
founder David Weikart tells educators: "Well folks, hold on to your
hats, because your salaries are going up!... Next year, Head Start
should receive approximately $700 to $800 million more in
appropriations .... There are signs of increasing financial support
for the early childhood field, including federal day care spending
bills that provide 'wrap-around services' for Head Start, allowing
Head Start to provide child care beyond its current program hours."
(David P. Weikart, High Scope Resource, Fall 1990, p. 22.) Weikart
calls for more lobbying: "We must be out there as advocates in the
public schools across the states when they are passing their
appropriations bills." (Ibid.)
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
      In the absence of hard scientific data, the federal government
should be very cautious before launching any programs. This is
particularly true, of course, for Washington's many-faceted campaign
to expand taxpayer-funded early childhood programs. 
<P>
      Warns psychologist Peery: "The public standard ought to be that
of prohibiting government from doing anything to children unless it
can be convincingly demonstrated that the children will benefit." 
<P>
      The answer to American cultural problems lies not in more
government programs to make up for family dysfunction but policies
that support families, particularly those with parents who care for
their own children. 
<P>
      To ensure that federal efforts help America's children:
<P>
      ** The Executive Order on the Family should be vigorously
enforced. Signed by Ronald Reagan in 1987, the order requires federal
agencies to take into account their policies' impact on family
formation, maintenance and general well-being" and to question whether
policies "strengthen or erode the stability of the family and the
marriage commitment" and "erode the authority and rights of parents in
the education, nurture and supervision of their children." This
Executive Order is widely ignored. The White House Office of Policy
Development submits an annual report on agencies' compliance with the
Executive Order on the Family and recommendations to the President. It
is time for George Bush to enforce them. 
<P>
      ** More research should be done on early education for
disadvantaged children to determine if there is a model that works and
can be replicated. Such efforts should target severely disadvantaged
children, follow methods for which there is evidence of success, and
use a controlled experiment format.
<P>
      ** Existing childhood education programs should be evaluated by
independent researchers. Bureaucracies cannot be expected to analyze
fairly the programs that they administer. Studies -- and federal
policies -- should take into account the impact of and impact on
families. 
<P>
      ** Federal policies should be based on giving parents more
choices. This could be achieved through vouchers and tax credits for
child care and education. If schools fail to teach, it is not because
they have not enrolled children soon enough.
<P>
      ** Families should be strengthened, not supplanted by social
programs. The federal tax code should not punish two-parent families
with children. The personal exemption for dependents should be
increased substantially. The $600 exemption of 1948 would be worth
more than $6,000 today. Welfare programs should be redesigned to
encourage fatherhood, not father abandonment. Taxpayers should not be
subsidizing family break-up, and government should intervene only in
cases of extreme hardship or abuse.  
<P>
      Families are America's greatest cultural resource. Federal
policies, however well-intentioned, that hinder families or supplant
parental authority lead to more social problems, not fewer. Parents
who sacrifice by cutting work hours, by temporarily leaving the work
force, by rearranging schedules or downscaling their life styles so
that one parent can care for young children at home suffer
discrimination two ways: they are taxed to subsidize services they do
not want or use, and they are taxed to support campaigns designed to
justify those services. 
<P>
      Early childhood development programs must be better scrutinized
for their effects on children and families before the federal
government spends more taxpayers' money on them. Says former Education
Secretary William J. Bennett: "Government, obviously, cannot fill a
child's emotional needs. Nor can it fill his spiritual or moral needs.
Government is not a father or a mother." (William J. Bennett,
"Children and Culture in Modern America," remarks at University of
Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana, October 17, 1990.)
<P>
      Empowering Parents. Children need their parents, and parents
need more choice in how they spend their time and money. The best way
to empower children is to empower their parents -- the people who care
most and know what is best for their children.

of federal policies on American culture and cultural values.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
     As Congress reconsiders recent crime legislation, lawmakers have an
opportunity to correct deficiencies in the law that encourage federal judges
to cut short the sentences of criminals -- often violent criminals -- and
release them back into the community.
<P>
     Tucked away in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 is Section 3626, a little-noticed provision that deals with the
role of the federal courts in prison and jail litigation: "A Federal court shall
not hold prison or jail crowding unconstitutional" unless an "individual
plaintiff inmate proves that the crowding" inflicts "cruel and unusual
punishment" (Eighth Amendment violations) on him. Relief in such cases
"shall extend no farther than necessary to remove the conditions that" afflict
the particular inmate plaintiff. A "Federal court shall not place a ceiling on
the inmate population of any Federal, State, or local detention facility" as
a remedy for Eighth Amendment violations unless "crowding is inflicting
cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified prisoners."
Unfortunately, this provision has not had the intended effect.
<P>
     Both in letter and in spirit, the crowding provision of the 1994 crime
bill enjoyed wide bipartisan support in Congress, drew favorable on-the-
record remarks from President Clinton and state and local officials of both
parties, and won great praise from law enforcement organizations. Moreover,
the provision reflected strong public support. In every relevant public
opinion survey on crime conducted since 1980, the need to keep judges
from interfering unduly with the detection, arrest, prosecution, and
incarceration of predatory street criminals has been supported by wide
majorities of citizens of every demographic description in every region of
the country.
<P>
     As a rule, federal judges are enormously respectful of both the public
safety and the federalism concerns at stake in prison and jail litigation. But
the first major test case of Section 3626 makes it clear that this provision,
as drafted in the 1994 crime bill, will succeed neither in keeping
irresponsible federal judges from releasing violent criminals nor in
preventing them from gutting highly effective truth-in-sentencing laws and
related public safety measures.
<P>
     Prosecutors already are pointing to the need for fresh legislation. In
December 1994, the National District Attorneys Association, a nonpartisan
body representing concerned prosecutors throughout America, approved a
resolution calling on federal lawmakers to adopt more detailed legislation
to deal with the reality that "federal court orders in prison litigation often
have severe adverse effects on public safety, law enforcement and local
criminal justice systems." What these prosecutors and other law enforcement
officials understand is that the federal courts have gone overboard in
protecting prisoners' rights. They have done so at a huge human and
financial cost to law-abiding Americans and at the expense of making a
mockery out of democratically enacted laws. Some federal judges have
made themselves the sovereigns of the cell blocks, forcing changes in
operations that have resulted in inmate-on-inmate murders, inmate-on-staff
assaults, a dramatic increase in spending on amenities and services for
inmates, and the early release each year of literally hundreds of thousands
of violent or repeat criminals.
<P>
     Congress needs to strengthen Section 3626 to address this continuing
problem.
<P>
<b>THE FAILING CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</b><P>
     In 1970, not a single prison system was operating under the
sweeping court orders common today. By 1990, some 508 municipalities
and over 1,200 state prisons were operating under judicial confinement
orders or consent decrees. Indeed, led by the federal bench, judges over the
last quarter-century have undone almost every major governmental anti-
crime initiative. 
<P>
     For example, in the 1970s, when state legislatures attempted to cut
funds for ineffective "rehabilitation" programs, judges declared that prisoners
have a legally enforceable right to some such services. In the June 1993
edition of Justice Quarterly, Professor Charles H. Logan of the University
of Connecticut and Dr. Gerald G. Gaes of the Federal Bureau of Prisons
offered an exhaustive analysis of the literature on such programs. They
found no evidence either that these programs rehabilitate prisoners or that
they come any closer to doing so today than they did twenty years ago.
    <P> Largely because of the courts, today about half of every tax dollar
spent on prisons goes not to the basics of security but to amenities and
services for prisoners. Prisons have about twice as many staff per inmate
today as they did in 1958. Yet most of the staffing increases have been to
administer the services and programs that judges have declared essential to
prisoners' rights -- recreation, education, and medical services.
<P>
     Likewise, in the 1980s, as many states passed mandatory-minimum
sentencing laws, the judges checkmated the public and its elected
representatives by imposing prison and jail caps. In the September 1994
edition of The Prison Journal, Dr. Gaes reviews the empirical literature on
prison crowding and reaches the same conclusions as numerous other
scholars: despite the conventional wisdom about the harmful effects of
crowding, the data simply do not support the belief that inmates suffer
greater levels of violence, illness, or other problems when prisons are
crowded. In many places, prison managers have run very crowded prisons
without any increases in critical incidents or other problems.
<P>
     Just the same, judges have continued to treat crowding as an
automatic threat to the well-being of prisoners and have enforced orders
resulting in the early release of dangerous criminals. In part because of these
judicial interventions, mandatory-minimum sentencing laws have been
largely ineffective: the median time that state prisoners spend in
confinement is only about 35 percent to 40 percent of their maximum
sentences.
<P>
     Many states are now tightening or abolishing parole and instituting
truth-in-sentencing laws that require offenders to serve at least 85 percent
of their sentenced time behind bars before release. Some are also instituting
measures that would result in life without parole for thrice-convicted violent
offenders. But unless the Congress acts decisively to curb federal judges,
they and their brethren on state and local benches -- not the legislatures --
will continue to be the chief doormen of America's revolving-door justice
system.
<P>
<b>REVOLVING-DOOR JUSTICE</b><P>
     According to studies by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),
in America today there are over 5 million persons under correctional
supervision -- behind bars, on probation, or on parole. But about 72 percent
of them are not incarcerated. Between 1980 and 1993, the nation's prison
population increased by 184 percent, and in 1994 there were over one
million convicted criminals in state and federal prisons. But over the same
period the nation's parole population increased by 204 percent. In 1994 over
3.5 million persons were on probation or parole.
<P>
     The vast majority of prisoners are violent or repeat offenders. The
latest BJS data show that 49 percent of state inmates are in prison for a
violent crime, 62 percent have been convicted of one or more violent crimes
in the past, and 94 percent have been convicted of a violent crime or been
sentenced in the past to probation or incarceration. Thus, barely 6 percent
of state prisoners are nonviolent offenders with no prior sentence to either
probation or incarceration.
<P>
     While official statistics show clearly that virtually all prisoners are
violent or repeat criminals, for at least two reasons the actual amount and
severity of crimes committed by prisoners when they are free are still many
times greater than these statistics reveal.
<P>
     The first reason is plea bargaining. Numerous studies show that over
90 percent of all adjudicated felony defendants do not go to trial, because
the offender pleads guilty to a lesser charge. Countless crimes are swept
under the criminal-records rug by plea bargaining.
<P>
     The second reason is that most prisoners commit many times more
non-drug felony crimes than the ones for which they are arrested, convicted,
and imprisoned. In two studies conducted in the early 1990s and published
in The Brookings Review, Harvard University economist Anne Morrison
Piehl and this author found that the median number of crimes, excluding all
drug crimes, committed by prisoners the year before they were imprisoned
was twelve.
<P>
     Not surprisingly, therefore, letting violent and repeat criminals out
of prison or jail and putting them on probation, parole, or pretrial release
results in countless murders, rapes, assaults, weapons offenses, robberies,
and burglaries each year. BJS data for the nation show that within three
years of sentencing, nearly half of all probationers and parolees are
convicted of a new crime or abscond. Among probationers with new felony
arrests, 54 percent are arrested once, 24 percent are arrested twice, and 22
percent are arrested three times or more. Nearly one-third of parolees who
were in prison for a violent crime, and nearly one-fifth who were in prison
for a property crime, are rearrested within three years for a violent crime.
Indeed, about 35 percent of all persons arrested for a violent crime are on
probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time of their arrest.
<P>
     The closer one looks, the clearer it becomes that a huge fraction of
America's crime problem results from lax probation, parole, and pretrial
release policies. For example, the August 1994 report of the Virginia
Governor's Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Policy reveals
that in Virginia 68 percent of all murders, 76 percent of all aggravated
assaults, and 81 percent of all robberies are the work of repeat offenders.
Between 1986 and 1993 alone, the people of Virginia would have been
spared over 1,000 violent crimes, including 73 murders, if non-drug felons
out on parole had remained in prison.
<P>
     Likewise, a 1993 Florida Department of Corrections study reported
that between January 1, 1987, and October 10, 1991, some 127,486
prisoners were released early from Florida prisons. Within a few years of
their early release, they committed over 15,000 violent and property crimes,
including 346 murders and 185 sex offenses. Most of these crimes would
have been averted had the convicted criminals spent even 85 percent of their
sentenced time in prison. But as BJS data show, nationally, about half of all
parolees serve 14 months or less in prison before they are released and
spend well under half of their sentenced time in confinement.
<P>
<b>THE PHILADELPHIA STORY</b><P>
     The public safety toll of court-ordered revolving-door justice and the
difficulty of getting irresponsible federal judges to respect the Constitution
and yield to these concerns is a grave problem. This is epitomized by the
recent history of the prison cap imposed on Philadelphia by U.S. District
Court Judge Norma L. Shapiro. 
<P>
     Typical of the judicial modus operandi in such cases, Judge Shapiro
cajoled the city into signing two consent decrees, one in 1986 and one in
1991, which gave her virtually unfettered control over the system and its
finances. This relieved her of the necessity of ever having to issue a finding
that any particular inmate in the system was suffering from any specific
violation of his constitutional rights. Philadelphia's Mayor, Edward Rendell,
who is a former district attorney, has been battling for years to get Judge
Shapiro to relinquish her control. So far, she has resisted successfully.
<P>

     The main consequence of Judge Shapiro's intervention has
effectively been to decriminalize drug and property crime in Philadelphia.
Data compiled by the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office and by two
independent researchers show that some 67 percent of all defendants
released because of the prison cap simply fail to appear in court. In just one
recent 18-month period in Philadelphia, 9,732 arrestees out on the streets
because of the prison cap were rearrested on new charges, including 79
murders, 90 rapes, 701 burglaries, 959 robberies, 1,113 assaults, 2,215 drug
offenses, and 2,748 thefts. Among those murdered by offenders released
because of the court's prison cap was Danny Boyle, a 30-year-old rookie
Philadelphia police officer.
<P>
     The prison cap has played havoc with the city's downtown
redevelopment efforts and forced local businesses to spend even more than
they have been spending on security. It also has turned Philadelphia into a
major drug smuggling port. One reason for this is that under the terms of
Judge Shapiro's orders, a drug criminal who possesses less than 50 grams
of heroin (street value $33,000), 50 grams of cocaine (street value $5,000),
or 50 pounds of marijuana (street value $225,000) goes free. Some 76
percent of drug defendants do not even bother to appear in court.
<P>
     In a statement issued on October 31, 1994, Judge Shapiro did what
some federal judges all around the country have been doing in such cases
for the last three decades: She rejected the public safety concerns of law-
abiding citizens. She dismissed empirical evidence on the effects of
crowding. And she ignored the relevant language of Section 3626 of the
1994 crime bill, which clearly mandates that consent decrees in such cases
be reopened forthwith.
<P>
<b>THE TEXAS CASE</b><P>
     The adverse public safety impact of rulings like Judge Shapiro's are
bad enough. But one also must be mindful of how unbridled federal court
intervention affects prison safety and prison budgets. A good illustration on
both counts is the Texas case of Ruiz v. Estelle. The case began in 1972 and
is still not completely resolved today. It was led throughout by Federal
Judge William Wayne Justice of the Eastern District Court.
<P>
     In a 248-page opinion issued in 1980, Judge Justice required scores
of changes in the Texas prison system. Among them: <ul>
<P><li>
 An end to the use of "building tenders" (inmates who served as prison
guards and often brutalized fellow prisoners); 
<P><li>
A complete revision in the inmate disciplinary process; 
<P><li>
A division of the prison population into management units of not more than
500 cells each; 
<P><li>
The delivery of state-of-the-art medical services to prisoners; 
<P><li>
A reduction in the number of prisoners in maximum-security blocks; 
<P><li>
The provision of a spacious single cell for each prisoner. 
<P></ul><p>
     Some of these orders were constitutionally required and highly
desirable (for example, the end of the corrupt building tender system). But
most of the orders had not a single constitutional, scientific, or moral
anchor. Nor did they acknowledge the fact that Texas prison officials had
already developed some outstanding programs for prisoners, including the
only fully accredited prison education system in the nation. Instead, the
micromanagement simply reflected Judge Justice's ideology and that of his
team of court monitors.
<P>
     In 1982 the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth District tried
to talk sense to Judge Justice, admonishing him that "the district court's
decree administers a massive dose when it is not yet demonstrable that a
lesser therapeutic measure would not suffice" to remedy conditions inside
Texas prisons. The Court of Appeals instructed him to "respect the right of
the state to administer its own affairs so long as it does not violate the
Constitution." Meanwhile, Texas prison officials continued to plead with
him to recognize that certain of his sweeping administrative requirements
would spawn short-term inmate violence and, in the decades to come, would
bankrupt the system if not the State of Texas itself.
<P>
     But Judge Justice turned a deaf ear to all such pleas. As a result, in
the mid-1980s Texas prisons experienced wholly unprecedented bouts of
murderous inmate-on-inmate violence. Between 1973 and 1980 there was a
total of 19 homicides in Texas prisons, and inmate-on-staff assaults were
exceedingly rare. But in 1983 and 1984, as the court's orders went into
effect, scores of prisoners were murdered, thousands were severely
assaulted, and rates of inmate-on-staff violence skyrocketed.
<P>
     So did costs. Prison operating expenses in Texas grew from $91
million in 1980 to $1.84 billion in 1994, a tenfold increase in real terms,
while the state's prison population barely doubled. In 1994 the Texas
Comptroller of Public Accounts issued a report which documented the fiscal
and administrative impact of the court's order on Texas prisons. The irony
of this report was that, after years of being battered by Judge Justice for
ostensibly failing to comply with his orders, Texas prison officials now were
being criticized for "overcompliance" with them. But the full and final
measure of responsibility for the human and financial toll of the court's
sweeping intervention must lie with the court itself.
<P>

<b>RESTRAINING JUDICIAL PANIC: THE JOB FOR CONGRESS</b><P>
     The history of judicial intervention into prisons and jails teaches that
it is not enough to raise public awareness or pass new laws. For
representative democracy to work on crime policy, and for Americans of
every race, creed, and color to be protected against the ravages of street
crime, more fundamental changes are needed.
<P>
     Whatever Congress does in revisiting the rest of the federal crime
bill of 1994, one of the most crucial steps must be to prohibit federal judges
from becoming de facto legislators and corrections czars. Section 3626 of
the 1994 federal crime bill was a step in the right direction, but only a tiny
step. The Congress should revisit this issue at once and take pains to ensure
that federal judges abide by federal laws governing the limited role of the
federal courts in conditions of confinement and related cases.
<P>
     The United States Constitution states in Article III, Section 2 that
"the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and
Fact, with such exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress
shall make" (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has declared over and
over again that federal courts must restrain themselves with respect to
conditions of confinement cases. To cite just a few key decisions, in Bell v.
Wolfish (1979), the Court declared that double-celling did not violate due
process. In Rhodes v. Chapman (1981), the Court held that double celling
was not cruel and unusual punishment. In Wilson v. Seiter (1991), the Court
ruled that constitutional violations had to be based on specific conditions
rather than "totality." And in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail (1992),
the Court endorsed flexible standards for modifying consent decrees in light
of changed circumstances.
<P>
     But within weeks of the passage of Section 3626 of the 1994 crime
bill, the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union
issued a memo, dated September 15, 1994, on how to "confront" the
provision. The memo mocked Congress for "taking a stand in favor of God,
motherhood, and locking up criminals" -- three values which, apparently, the
ACLU does not hold so dear. 
<P>
     Irresponsible federal judges, along with prisoners' rights lawyers and
anti-incarceration lobbyists, need to be reminded of the clear language of the
nation's governing political document with regard to the power of Congress
to set the appellate jurisdiction of the federal judiciary. Most Americans
want prisoners to have basic amenities (decent food, adequate medical care)
and services (educational opportunities, drug treatment). But they do not
want prisons to be virtual resorts, and they most certainly do not want
another generation's worth of violent and repeat criminals returned to the
streets because of some judge's political ideology, rejection of statistical
evidence, jurisprudential ignorance, or stubborn delusions about the
consequences of "crowding."
<P>
     To prevent judges from acting in this way, Congress needs to pass
legislation that unambiguously defines and further limits appropriate
remedies in prison and jail conditions cases. For unless and until the courts
are curbed, no mere changes in the law -- truth-in-sentencing reforms, three-
strikes mandates, new death penalty provisions -- will survive the judicial
gantlet that has effectively stymied every major democratically enacted anti-
crime measure of the last quarter-century.
<P>
     What if Congress acts to strengthen Section 3626 of the federal
crime bill but the lower federal courts do not abide by the additional
restrictions on prison remedies set by Congress? If that happens, then the
Congress, in the name of the people, should move at once to exercise its full
powers under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. The most
authoritative interpretation of that power is the plainest one. The late
Edward S. Corwin is widely considered this country's premier scholar of the
U.S. Constitution. As he wrote, "[T]he lower Federal courts derive all their
jurisdiction immediately from acts of Congress.... Also, all writs by which
jurisdiction is asserted or exercised are authorized by Congress.... The chief
external restraint upon judicial review arises from Congress's unlimited
control over the Court's appellate jurisdiction, as well as of the total
jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts."
<P>
     Congress should no longer abdicate its responsibility for the human
and financial harm done by activist federal judges. The place to begin is by
curbing federal judges who substitute the ACLU's prisoners' rights
manifesto for the Bill of Rights and impose prison caps and other orders
which permit violent and repeat criminals to rule the streets.

    The Los Angeles riots have triggered demands for fundamental
reform of many policies affecting poor, inner-city neighborhoods. One
of the most pressing is education. In south-central Los Angeles, like
most inner-city communities, children today are consigned to an
extensive public school system which fails to educate them. That lack
of a basic education in most cases holds back those children for the
rest of their lives, condemning them to low-wage jobs or
unemployment. 
<P>
    The good news for these children and their parents is that the
Bush Administration authored legislation last year that was intended
to achieve fundamental education reform by "reinventing" the American
school system. The America 2000 proposal centers on parental choice,
national testing, and a program creating new kinds of schools.
<P>
    The bad news for inner-city children, and indeed for all American
children, is that one year later the reform package is facing fierce
opposition on Capitol Hill. In January the Senate stripped the
legislation of its most significant reform provisions, most notably
school choice. The America 2000 proposal is about to be taken up in
the House, where hostility to the core provisions is, if anything,
greater than in the Senate.  
<P>
    If poor Americans are to have the chance of a good education, the
Administration must regain the ground it has lost in the debate. This
requires George Bush to stand fast and fight much harder for his
America 2000 proposal, especially the key parental choice provisions.
If it is to succeed, the Administration must:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Strongly support certain proposed floor amendments to committee-
    passed legislation, most notably the amendment authored by Dick
    Armey, the Texas Republican, which revitalizes the school choice
    initiatives.
<P>
    Threaten to veto any legislation that omits central elements of
    the Administration's original reform package, such as school
    choice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> America 2000</B>
<P>
    President Bush's original America 2000 proposal contained four
central themes:
<P>
1)       Getting better and more accountable schools, through
         parental choice, national testing, and alternative
         certification (Alternative certification means allowing
         individuals without education degrees to become certified
         teachers, provided they have appropriate experience or a
         degree in their field.);
<P>
2)       Creating a new generation of American schools by encouraging
         schools that "break the mold" by offering alternative
         educational programs;
<P>
3)       Producing a nation in which families and communities help
         encourage students to learn by instilling respect for
         education, competence, and academic performance; and 
<P>
4)       Creating communities in which learning can happen, by
         increasing parental and community involvement in education
         reform.
<P>
    The President's America 2000 strategy also incorporated national
education goals to make Americans more competitive in the world
economy. These goals include the achievement of specific academic
standards, new curricula for American schools, a system of voluntary
national examinations, and more flexibility for public school teachers
and principals.
<P>
<B> Hill Action</B>
<P>
    The Administration sent its America 2000 package to Congress last
fall, after announcing the outline of the package in April. But
instead of incorporating the proposal's main features in a new
education bill, the House Education and Labor Committee last October
reported out H.R. 3320, which largely ignored the President's
strategy. Not to be outdone, the Senate this January passed S. 2,
which also failed to incorporate the most significant aspects of the
President's plan, and did little more than authorize $850 million for
a new block grant for school experiments effectively controlled by the
education establishment. 
<P>
    The Senate bill is severely flawed. Because of unwise concessions
by the Administration, the legislation contains only watered-down
provisions for creating "New American Schools," the experimental,
"break the mold" schools, intended to test innovative programs and
approaches to education, and it allows little regulatory flexibility
for teachers and administrators. In fact, the Senate bill is largely a
triumph of bureaucratic process over substance. 
<P>
    Worst of all, the Senate rejected even a very modest version of
the Administration's school choice proposal.The defeated amendment,
designed by the Administration and Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah
Republican, would have authorized a three-year demonstration project
granting $30 million each year in education vouchers to help low-
income parents send their children to quality private schools, and it
would have provided a $5 million grant to each of six low-income
communities selected nationally to create pilot programs offering low-
income students in the community their choice of area public or
private schools.
<P>
    While very small, when compared with the total federal education
budget of $32.3 billion, these choice provisions would give low-income
parents the financial means to opt out of their failing public school
-- a choice which middle and upper income families already have -- and
allow their children to be educated in another school. This small
demonstration program simply would give school choice supporters an
opportunity, on a limited trial basis, to show that choice works. But
as a result of intense pressure from the education bureaucracy,
particularly the teacher and school administrator unions, the Senate
refused to sanction an experiment with choice.
<P>
    Likewise, the committee-passed House bill contains no choice
provisions. Representative William Ford, the Michigan Democrat and
Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, announced in
February that he would not bring the House bill containing portions of
the Bush Administration's education proposals (H.R. 3320) to the floor
for a vote. Instead, the House will consider a committee-authored bill
(H.R. 4323), which explicitly bans federal funding of private school
choice programs. It actually scales back existing community
involvement in improving local schools and gives more control to
public school boards, who in the past have had little interest in
serious innovation. H.R. 4323 also could hinder choice legislation at
the state level by sending a signal from Washington that choice is
unacceptable, and also by prohibiting the use of federal funds, which
often are used to pay for state pilot programs involving private
school choice. At the end of last year's legislative session 23 states
had some type of choice plan, and well over half gave consideration to
choice legislation. (School Choice Programs:  What's Happening in the
States, compiled and edited by Jeanne Allen with Angela Hulsey, The
Heritage Foundation, March 1992.) Significantly, efforts to promote
choice at the state level have been led by teachers and business
leaders as well as parents.
<P>
    The bill calls for a $700 million federal block grant program
which would be spent as the state and local bureaucracies saw fit as
long as it did not go toward choice programs involving private
schools. Vague descriptions of authorized activities would permit
practically any fad the education bureaucracies want to fund, without
any kind of accountability to parents. H.R. 4323 also contains
provisions aimed at "addressing disparities in expenditures and the
reasons for such disparities among local educational agencies in each
state and among states across the nation." These latter provisions
reflect the assumption that the way to improve schools in poor
communities is to make sure that school spending is equal throughout
the country. Yet numerous studies show that there is no significant
correlation between spending and school quality. (See John Chubb and
Terry Moe, Politics, Markets, and America's Schools (Washington, D.C.: 
The Brookings Institution, 1990).)
<P>
<B> The Armey Amendment</B>
<P>
    In an effort to correct the shortcomings of H.R. 4323,
Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican, plans to offer a
floor amendment to H.R. 4323. The amendment goes a long way toward
restoring the original content of the President's America 2000
proposals. The amendment: 
<P>
1)       Limits the use of the $700 million in new funds to projects
         based on school choice, site-based management, alternative
         teacher certification, merit testing, and New American
         Schools; <P>
2)       Allows the Secretary of Education to deny grants to
         activities which in his view will not promote reform in
         education; and<P>
3)       Gives state governors, not teachers and school
         administrators, the authority to head the panels charged
         with determining the use of federal grant money. 
<P>
    The Armey amendment explicitly allows private, parochial, and
public schools to be included in choice experiments and earmarks a
minimum of 25 percent of program funds for these initiatives. The
White House Choice
<P>
    America 2000 advocates the use of federal funds to stimulate
state and local level reforms based on choice and other promising
approaches. Congress, however, is transforming the plan into yet
another education spending bill aimed at propping up a government
school monopoly that is ruining American public schools and failing to
educate American children. The results so far of such congressional
"business as usual" education policies: Federal education spending at
all levels of government has increased over 25 percent since 1989, yet
test scores have fallen. 
<P>
    So far, the Administration has shown a desire to compromise on
its original proposal while the Senate and House tears it to shreds.
White House dithering merely encourages Hill opposition. As the
legislative disaster in the Senate was unfolding, the President
rightly threatened to veto any bill that did not contain education
choice provisions. But after the Senate passed a bill explicitly
rejecting choice, the Administration backpedaled and announced that it
was "reevaluating" its own position. Now, with the House legislation
soon facing a vote, opponents of major reform take comfort in the fact
that the Administration has neither issued an explicit veto threat
against H.R. 4323, although Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has
recommended such a veto, nor even indicated that it will support the
Armey Amendment on the House floor. The "Education President,"
opponents understandably conclude, seems prepared to give up on real
education reform without a fight. 
<P>
<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
    The Bush Administration has an historic opportunity to improve
American education. But the President can only do this if he takes the
initiative and makes clear to friend and foe alike what he really
supports and what is unacceptable. If he wishes to keep alive any
prospect of the core elements of America 2000 becoming law, he must:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Back strongly amendments for education choice and other key
    reforms when H.R. 4323 reaches the House floor, including the
    proposed Armey Amendment;
<P>
    State unequivocally that he will veto any education bill that
    does not contain education choice provisions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
    Only if the Administration draws a clear line, and forces
Congress to choose between fundamental reform and business as usual in
the schools, will inner-city children in America at last have the
chance to obtain a sound basic education.

<title>Look-Out Study, Round 2 Questionnaire, Section 1</title>
<body bgcolor="#96E1FA">
<hr><p>
<center><font size=+3>1996 GLOBAL LOOK-OUT PANEL</font>
<p><hr><p>
<font size=+2>ROUND 2 QUESTIONNAIRE<p><b>SECTION I</b></font><p>
<font size=+1>SUMMARY OF SUGGESTED DEVELOPMENTS</font></center><p>
<br>
A summary of all of the developments suggested by respondents to the first round is presented in
this
section. Your judgment about the likelihood and importance of each of these developments is
requested. In addition please provide your judgment about the leadership category that should be
the
most responsible for "handling" the development.<p>

If you respond by email, there is no need to duplicate the entire section below: just repeat the
development number, followed by the three numbers that reflect your judgement from the three
scales
below.<p>

1. Likelihood that the development as described by a Round 1 participant is underway. In
answering
this question, please use the following key:<p>

<ul><ul><ul><ul>
         <TABLE WIDTH= BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>1 = almost certain </TD><TD> </TD><TD><ul><ul> 4 = unlikely</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2 = likely </TD><TD> </TD><TD><ul><ul> 5 = almost impossible</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3 = as likely as not</TD><TD></TD></TR>
</TABLE><p></ul></ul></ul></ul>   

2. Relative importance of the development, using these criteria: severity or amount of benefit,
number
of people who may ultimately be affected, possibility that policy can make a difference
(susceptibility
to our influence if we act in time), imminence of impacts, permanence of effects, and lack of a
responsible decision maker (making attention to the development important to attract responsible
decision maker or leader).  Please use this key in answering this question:<p>

<ul><ul><ul><ul>
         <TABLE WIDTH= BORDER=0>
<TR><TD> 1 = urgently important</TD><TD> </TD><TD><ul><ul> 4 =
unimportant</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> 2 = important</TD><TD></TD><TD><ul><ul> 5 = trivial</TD></TR>
<TR><TD> 3 = modest</TD><TD></TD></TR>
</TABLE><p></ul></ul></ul></ul>    

3. Agency or group that should be primarily responsible for leading strategy to address
development:
<p><ul>

          1 = Individuals or small groups with common interests<br>
          2 = Governments and government agencies<br>
          3 = Non governmental agencies (foundations, large special interest groups, 
                    universities, international NGOs, etc.)<br>
          4 = Corporations<br>
          5 = United Nations System (specify organ: Secretariat, General Assembly, UNDP, Security
Council, World Bank, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNU, UNEP, WHO, etc.<br>
          6= Not clear<br>
          7= Other (specify)
<p></ul>

Please write three numbers after each item. The first will represent your judgment about
likelihood,
the second, importance, and the third, responsible organizations.<p>

Please add comments, if you wish, at the end of the list. Particularly for those items that you have
judged both
relatively almost certain and urgently important, please note some consequences that you think
may flow from
the development and some appropriate strategies or goals.<p>

You may, of course, add other  developments to the list. These developments should have already
begun in some
small way, and have important implications for the future.  For these newly added items, please
also include your
view of possible consequences, possible policies or goals and any notes and sources of
information about the
developments you have identified. Items suggested in Round 1 are listed in the table below:<p>

<HR><P>


Each development is preceded with an index number assigned to it upon arrive at the Project's
coordinating office.  To avoid long fax, airmail, and email, just write this number followed by your
section of the three numbers.  For example: 155-2-1-4 would mean development number 155 is
likely,
and if it occurs, then it is urgently important, and corporations should lead the strategy to make
the
development evolve in the best possible way.<p>

Resume
I am a Student of Social Sciences at the Georgia Augusta University of Goettingen, Germany. 
Before I started this internship, I spent an exchange year at SUNY Oswego, NY.
Although my field of studies is political science, I chosed to work for the Millennium Project
in the area of Economics and Wealth. My special interest was concentrated on the future of the
labor markets. Since that was the first time that I got involved into Future Studies, I had so
me difficulties to respond to a completely new way of thinking and doing research. I was 
sitting in the downtown office and kept track on futurist material in the internet.
Everything was very interesting, new, and exciting. It took me a while to distinguish between 
the serious stuff that mattered to me and the rather populistic ideas; but I red everything I 
could get (including soccer results from Germany).
In addition, I used the library at The American University, The United Nations Information 
Center, and some books and articles from Jerry's private library. 
I noticed that the longer I was occupied with this internship, the more I changed my attitude 
towards the future. As many of my friends at home, my general expectations of the future were 
pessimistic; but the more theories, ideas, and scenarios I investigated, the wider became the 
range of possible futures. I learned about possibilities that I never would have thought 
before. Now I am much more optimistic because I have a much wider variety of answers to the 
challenges of the future. 
The highlight, of course was attending the World Future Society Conference fom July 14th to 
July 18th 1996.

The UNU has been organizing an annual UNU Global Seminar in the

was held in September last year.

The UNU Global Seminar is designed to enhance international awareness
among the student population in Japan through active interaction
with scholars and experts working in UNU's global networks. Undergraduate
students, in their junior year and above, and those in postgraduate
courses in Japanese universities are eligible to apply. Applicants
must understand both Japanese and English languages. Approximately
50 students selected from the applicants will participate in a
four-day course.
<P>
In the Second Kobe Session, lecturers include Mr. Ingvar Carlsson,
former Prime Minister of Sweden (to be confirmed), Ms. Gertrude
Mogella, Secretary-General for the Fourth World Conference on
Women held in Beijing, China, last September, Professor Jun Nishikawa,
Waseda University, and Dr. Andrzej Wojtczak, Director, WHO Centre
for Health Development in Kobe. Please see the attached programme
for details.
<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="zero"><B>PRESS BRIEFING TO BE HELD ON UNU'S ZERO
EMISSIONS RESEARCH INITIATIVE</B></A></CENTER>
<P>
The United Nations University (UNU) will hold a press briefing
on its Zero Emissions Research Initiative (UNU/ZERI) on Tuesday,
16 July 1996, at 16.00 hours at the UNU Headquarters in Shibuya.
<P>
The UNU launched the UNU/ZERI project under the leadership of
Mr. Gunter Pauli, a Belgian businessman and author in 1994. During
the first year of activity, UNU/ZERI focused on the development
of the scientific theory for zero emissions and the design of
a methodology universally acceptable to all industries. The second
year of UNU/ZERI work was directed to the launching and set up
of pilot projects in Fiji, Namibia and Tanzania.
<P>
The press briefing on 16 July 1996 is meant to describe the plans
for the third year of UNU/ZERI work. In its next phase, UNU/ZERI
will focus on the organization of postgraduate training courses
on zero emissions on each continent and on the expansion of the
research and pilot projects which are to cover some 30 different
agricultural and industrial sectors.
<P>
During its first two years, UNU/ZERI has benefited from growing
private support. Additional funding in the next phase will be
used to scale up the pilot projects to industrial test plants.
The first two test plants will be constructed in Indonesia and
Malaysia. The potential impact of UNU/ZERI research and development
in South-East Asia goes beyond a reduction in the level of pollution
in the region; it could generate additional employment, enhance
competitiveness and create one of the largest new carbon sinks
in the region.
<P>
The press briefing on 16 July will seek to provide more detailed
information on developments with UNU/ZERI and will review the
results of the recent Second UNU World Congress on Zero Emissions
held in Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, during 29-31 May 1996.
<P>
Members of the news media are cordially invited to attend the
briefing. Prof. Tarcisio Della Senta, Director a.i., of the UNU's
newly established Institute of Advanced Studies (UNU/IAS), the
institutional base of the UNU/ZERI project, will chair the briefing.
Mr. Gunter Pauli, the director of the UNU/ZERI project, will provide
detailed information and respond to questions from the press.
Japanese/English interpretation will be provided.

<P>
The Government of Namibia has committed 1 million Namibian dollars
(US$272,500) for the launching of the second UNU/ZERI program
in Heinties Bay, Namibia, and will make annually the same contribution
to ensure that the project is successfully implemented. The Heinties
Bay innovative project includes research on sustainable seaweed
resource development and utilization, the cultivation of micro-algae
and salt tolerant plants, research on fog harvesting converting
the Cold Benguela Current which is the cause of the Namibian desert
landscape into a source of water, all linked to the recovery of
waste streams from the industrial breweries along the Namibian
coast.
<P>
The UNU and UNESCO have agreed to establish a special ZERI Chair
at the University of Namibia. The Chair will serve as a focal
point for zero emissions courses in Africa and will promote the
establishment of contacts with the scientific community in the
region. Prof. Keto Mshigeni, Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University
of Namibia, has been designated as the first recipient of the
UNESCO/UNU-ZERI Chair. 
<P>
On Tuesday, 29 October 1996, the President of Namibia, His Excellency
Dr. Sam Nujoma, will visit the Headquarters of the United Nations
University (UNU) in Tokyo. Dr.Nujoma is in Tokyo on an official
visit to Japan. During his visit to the UNU, Dr. Nujoma will give
a seminar on &quot;Breakthroughs in scientific applications: the
impact for African development - the case of Namibia.&quot; The
seminar will begin at approximately 15.15 hours at the UNU Headquarters.
<P>
Dr. Nujoma was born in 1929 and attended school in Windhoek. He
was a joint founder of the Southwest Africa People's Organization
(SWAPO) and served as its president from 1960. In the Namibian
independence movement, Dr. Nujoma was exiled and turned to armed
struggle after the rejection by the International Court of Justice
of a SWAPO complaint against South Africa in August 1966. He led
SWAPO negotiations in numerous international settings finally
culminating in the March 1989 resolution of the United Nations
General Assembly providing independence for Namibia. He returned
to Namibia in 1989 and became President in March 1990. He has
won a number of international awards and citations, including
the Lenin Peace Prize, the Frederic Joliot Curie Gold Medal and
the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize.
<P>
Dr. Nujoma is also the Chancellor of the University of Namibia
which is a committed supporter of the vision of zero emissions
research. Namibia was, in fact, the first country in the world
to establish an industrial plant which is constructed within the
framework of the zero emissions vision. The new sorghum brewery
plant, recently constructed by the Namibian Breweries in Tsumed,
northern Namibia, has brought about the realization of the first
ever university-industry partnership in Namibia. The University
of Namibia is a key partner in the UNU's Zero Emissions Research
Initiative (UNU/ZERI).
<P>
Members of the news media are cordially invited to attend the
seminar to be given by President Nujoma on 29 October 1996.

A GUIDE TO SUCCESSFUL FUTURES RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET
</center></strong>
<hr>
As you may have already discovered in searching for futurist
 pages on the Internet, it is easy to be pointed in 
multiple directions;  none of which are where you initially intended 
to go.  The chart below offers some helpful hints and starting points, 
but it is by no means exhaustive.<br>
<p>
The information available on the WWW is constantly and rapidly
 changing.  If you find any of the following information is out-dated,  
or find other excellent futurists pages, please contact the Millennium
Project webmaster so that this page can serve as a valuable resource
 for interns to come.<br>
<hr>
<strong>
Some Background Information on Search Engines
</strong>
<hr>
The variety of search engines continues to expand.  Each search engine searches 
from different databases and matches the key word(s) in different 
manners.  For this reason, it sometimes can take multiple attempts 
on multiple search engines to find what you are searching for on the 
Internet.  Some search engines may prove more effective for specific 
searches (ie proper names, book titles), while other search engines may 
are more effective for general searches (ie concepts, general fields 
of study).  Before starting a search, it is well worth your time 
to read any "searching tips" that might be available from the search 
engine's main page.  The tips explain how you can make your search 
more effective while using that specific search engine.  Check out 
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/search">http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/search</a> 
for a good comparison of search engines.
<br>

<hr>
<strong>
Futurist Research on the Internet
</strong>
<hr>
This following lists represent the results of futurist studies searches 
on 4 popular search engines <ul>
<li>AltaVista, <a href="http://www.altavista.com">http://www.altavista.com</a>
<li>Infoseek, <a href="http://www.infoseek.com">http://www.infoseek.com</a>
<li>Lycos, <a href="http://www.lycos.com">http://www.lycos.com</a>
<li>Yahoo, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</a>
</ul>
The key words used for the searches are the following: <ol>
<li>FUTURIST
<li>FUTURES STUDIES
<li>FUTURES RESEARCH</ol>
All of the relevant sites 
are listed with hotlinks for quick access.  With the turning of the 
millennium on the close horizon, the term "futurist" is implemented 
more and more frequently in reference to anyone thinking past the 
year 2000.  This chart is only the beginning, and will be more useful 
as interns add additional input and findings.

<blockquote><font size=4>People of all ages, cultures, and walks of life are invited to gather under trees around the world with family, friends, and other community members to promote a global vision of unity-in-diversity.  This global celebration and participatory event of one world family under one symbolic tree of life, pays tribute to our collective home, the Earth.  The use of a symbolic "Tree of Life" or "World Tree" has been consistantly represented in most ancient myths and cultures around the world.<P></font><p></center>

2nd Annual <B>TREES AROUND THE WORLD</B>
<P>
</CENTER>

TREES AROUND THE WORLD was a featured event of the 1995 <a href="partners.html"><i>Partners for the Planet</i></a> 1995 National Youth Summit, spearheaded by environmental youth organization, <a href="treemusk.html">TREE MUSKETEERS</a>.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=80% ALIGN=CENTER><BR>

Many hundreds of years ago, after generations of bloodshed, five warring tribes were moved to unite in peace.  They buried their weapons under a great tree.<p>  

An opportunity arises to reclaim that vision around the world.<p>

A giant sequoia, the largest living tree on our planet, calls to us.  It is currently and appropriately named after a war hero, General Sherman.  There is a dream to unite around trees all over the world, and to bury our prejudices and hatred.<p>

The tree invites everyone: warriors and peacemakers; victims and aggressors; children and elders; the indifferent and the passionate, enemies and friends.  Under the shade of this tree we are all equal.  It has seen our ancestors come and go, and it will be here when we are gone.<p>

The dream is that today's children will live to see this tree, all the trees, in peace.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>

<DL><DT><a name="info">FOR YOUTH AGES 10-18 YEARS OLD</a>
<DD>The Summit brought a diverse cross-section of ethnicity, age, 
gender, physical ability, and environmental activism from all corners 
of the country and beyond together as the youth environmental 
movement.  Partners for the Planet includes youth and adults from 
major nonprofits, grassroots groups, government agencies, 
professional associations, corporate America, and YOU!  The second 
"by-kids" National Partners for the Planet Youth Summit was a 
forum in which young activists could network, learn, share ideas, and 
have fun.<BR></DL>
<DL><DT>PRESENTED BY YOUTH!<BR>
	<DD>The Summit is about more than environmental 
education. Kids who attended got to experience the issues hands-on 
through outdoor activities.<BR>
	<DD>Young people presented workshops, sessions and 
speakers with a focus on youth and other natural resources. Kids
learned about everything from the ecosystem of the Great Salt Lake to 
the exploration of the mountain`s forest integrity!<BR>		
	<DD>Delegates returned to their communities with the 
knowledge and skills necessary to take action.<BR></DL>

<DL><DT>ADULT PARTNERS WELCOME!
	<DD>Many families attended the Summit as part of their summer 
vacation. Workshops for adult partners were planned, as well as 
separate dances and events to allow these very special supporters to 
network and enjoy themselves.</DL><BR>

<DL><DT>YOUNG ADULTS NEEDED!
<DD>19-23 year-olds are invited to serve as Workshop Facilitators to 
ensure the "by youth" spirit of workshops is preserved.  No 
experience is necessary, but applicants must believe in the power 
and value of youth in environmentalism.<P>
<dd>Please Contact:   	Tree Amigos<br>

<dd>Note: Travel-related expenses are responsibility of the Workshop 
Facilitator.</DL>

<dl><dt>HOSTED BY YOUTH!
	<dd>We want to introduce you, our 
readers, to the Summiters who sat on the Steering Committee for the 
1995 National Youth Summit. They are youth/ adult teams from 19 
different organizations all working together as Partners for the 
Planet. Each team chairs a subcommittee (a group of volunteers who 
planned one certain part of the whole event such as a banquet), and 
reports on their progress to the whole group. Your youth hosts are 
11-18 years of age and together, the membership is nearly six 
million people from all 50 states and 44 foreign countries. There are 
a lot of kids represented on the planning team for the Summit. 
Maybe you're one of them!<br></dl>

<DL><DT>PARTNERS FOR THE PLANET PHILOSOPHY
<DD>The focus is on solutions--not problems, so there is no 
sitting in judgement or pointing fingers of blame.  Partners for the 
Planet projects avoid duplicating efforts of others thereby paving the 
way for ongoing partnerships.<BR>
<DD>All programs are youth-led, and adults serve as a support 
system for the young decisions makers.<BR>  
<DD>Human development is integral to all program activity, and an 
extended definition of diversity is sought.
<DD>  We write, speak, act, and think with integrity.</DL><br>

<i>The logo for the 1995 Partners for the Planet Youth Summit is the masterpiece of 17-year-old Mason Poe, an integral member of Kids F.A.C.E. Mason has served as a youth partner on the Executive Committee of the Youth Summits since the first one in 1993.  There is more to Mason's illustration than you may see at first.  If you look closely at the roots of the tree, you will notice that they are little children who give life to the united youth environmental movement.  This movement stretches out its arms to spread its message to the world through nature (butterflies).  The snowcapped mountains in the background represent Snowbird, Utah, the location of the '95 Youth Summit.</i><br>

<FONT SIZE=4>MISSION AND PROGRAMS</FONT>
</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The mission of the Tree Musketeers is to bring about environmental improvement through their own actions, and by their example to challenge other young people and businesses to join the youth environmental movement.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Tree Musketeers is structured to develop youth in leadership roles that will impact the adult world. Recognizing that kids are the political and business leaders of tomorrow, members of Tree Musketeers deliver a positive message, are active citizens of the community, and vocal advocates of Mother Nature.<P>

Tree Musketeers has actively influenced municipal policies, published a regular column in the local newspaper, persuaded merchants to carry Earth-safe products, produced and aired an environmental television quiz show, set up a children`s Speakers Bureau, planted more than 700 trees as a pollution barrier around El Segundo, and established local and national (800) hotlines.<P>

TM has also chaired the city's Recycling Committee in the drafting of the municipal integrated waste management plan, conducted the public education component of the interim plan, and opened the city's first complete recycling drop-off center. It continues to work with locally-based corporate giants in directing attention to the environment as a member of the South Bay Business Environmental Coalition.<P>

By 1993, Tree Musketeers administered the first National Youth Environmental Summit, where two youth directors chaired a steering committee of 15 youth agency partners, whose collective profile represented nearly half a million organization members of 446 chapters in 50 states and 35 foreign countries.</blockquote><P><P>

<CENTER>
Some of the organization`s other programs carried out <br>in partnership with other groups and other agencies, include:
</CENTER>

<ul><li><a href="taw.html">TREES AROUND THE WORLD</a> invites people of all ages, cultures, and walks of life to gather under trees with family, friends and other community members to promote a global vision of unity-in-diversity. This global celebration, under one symbolic tree of life, pays tribute to our collective home, the Earth.<p>

<li>GLOBAL SISTERS COMMUNITIES unites American sister groups/school with children in Mainland China, and other countries where environmental doors are just opening, in Earth Day celebrations.<p>
<li>	 HOMETOWN FOREST PROGRAM produces an educational by kids and for kids community forestry package containing communication and management tools for implementing local Hometown projects.<p>
<li>	 YOUNG EXECUTIVE PROGRAM serves as an innovative multi-level educational model ensuring that skills of the young executives keep pace with their rapidly growing agency. In this program, leadership, personal development, volunteer coordination, grant administration, and program direction are among the skills developed and used to support the organizationÕs activities.<p>Published in Grassroots Magazine Vol. II / Issue I <br>

<P>
The United Nations University (UNU) will hold a press briefing
on its Universal Networking Language (UNL) project on Thursday,
17 October 1996, at 15.00 hours at the UNU Headquarters. UNL is
an Internet plug-in that will facilitate communication between
peoples with different languages. Along with its companion software
&quot;Enconverter&quot; and &quot;Deconverter,&quot; it will allow
anyone with Internet access to &quot;enconvert&quot; text from
a UN Member State language into UNL, or &quot;deconvert&quot;

<P>
The Government of Namibia has committed 1 million Namibian dollars
(US$272,500) for the launching of the second UNU/ZERI program
in Heinties Bay, Namibia, and will make annually the same contribution
to ensure that the project is successfully implemented. The Heinties
Bay innovative project includes research on sustainable seaweed
resource development and utilization, the cultivation of micro-algae
and salt tolerant plants, research on fog harvesting converting
the Cold Benguela Current which is the cause of the Namibian desert
landscape into a source of water, all linked to the recovery of
waste streams from the industrial breweries along the Namibian
coast.
<P>
The UNU and UNESCO have agreed to establish a special ZERI Chair
at the University of Namibia. The Chair will serve as a focal
point for zero emissions courses in Africa and will promote the
establishment of contacts with the scientific community in the
region. Prof. Keto Mshigeni, Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University
of Namibia, has been designated as the first recipient of the
UNESCO/UNU-ZERI Chair. 
<P>
On Tuesday, 29 October 1996, the President of Namibia, His Excellency
Dr. Sam Nujoma, will visit the Headquarters of the United Nations
University (UNU) in Tokyo. Dr.Nujoma is in Tokyo on an official
visit to Japan. During his visit to the UNU, Dr. Nujoma will give
a seminar on &quot;Breakthroughs in scientific applications: the
impact for African development - the case of Namibia.&quot; The
seminar will begin at approximately 15.15 hours at the UNU Headquarters.
<P>
Dr. Nujoma was born in 1929 and attended school in Windhoek. He
was a joint founder of the Southwest Africa People's Organization
(SWAPO) and served as its president from 1960. In the Namibian
independence movement, Dr. Nujoma was exiled and turned to armed
struggle after the rejection by the International Court of Justice
of a SWAPO complaint against South Africa in August 1966. He led
SWAPO negotiations in numerous international settings finally
culminating in the March 1989 resolution of the United Nations
General Assembly providing independence for Namibia. He returned
to Namibia in 1989 and became President in March 1990. He has
won a number of international awards and citations, including
the Lenin Peace Prize, the Frederic Joliot Curie Gold Medal and
the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize.
<P>
Dr. Nujoma is also the Chancellor of the University of Namibia
which is a committed supporter of the vision of zero emissions
research. Namibia was, in fact, the first country in the world
to establish an industrial plant which is constructed within the
framework of the zero emissions vision. The new sorghum brewery
plant, recently constructed by the Namibian Breweries in Tsumed,
northern Namibia, has brought about the realization of the first
ever university-industry partnership in Namibia. The University
of Namibia is a key partner in the UNU's Zero Emissions Research
Initiative (UNU/ZERI).
<P>
Members of the news media are cordially invited to attend the
seminar to be given by President Nujoma on 29 October 1996.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>NATO Earthquake Workshop Held in Central Asia</CENTER></B></FONT>
<P>
       Half of the Central Asian Republics' six million people live, work, and go
to school in buildings that are vulnerable to collapse during earthquakes.  And the tragedies in Armenia and Sakhalin will be repeated in Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan unless these buildings are strengthened.
<P>
       This grim warning was issued by an international team of structural and
geophysics experts attending a NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Earthquakes in
Almaty, Kazakhstan. The United Nations University (UNU) and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO)organized the 22-25 October workshop to assess earthquake hazards in the region's major cities and devise ways of reducing them.
<P>
       The problem is urgent.  According to Bruce Bolt of the University of California,
Berkeley, "There is a high probability that a severe earthquake will occur near one of the
region's capital cities within the next 20 years, resulting in devastation similar to the
1988 quake in Leninakan, Armenia.
<P>
       Delegates said they will urge their governments to address earthquake
safety at schools, day-care centers, hospitals and emergency response agencies.  "The very
future of Central Asia is dependent on the integrity and continued functioning of these
facilities," said Bolt.
<P>
       Brian Tucker, President of GeoHazards International and Dr. Vitaly Khalturin of the
Russian Academy of Sciences' United Institute of Physics of the Earth, co-chaired the
workshop.  They said one of  its major goals was to identify available resources.  "Rather
than just ask their governments for money, participants committed to taking steps themselves," said Tucker.  They agreed that engineering teams from Central Asian and other countries will design and implement measures to upgrade important buildings.  They also created a joint Central Asian Urban Earthquake Risk Management Working
Group, made up of foreign experts and delegation heads from the five attending republics.
The group's purpose is to promote urban earthquake risk management throughout Central
Asia.  The workshop's results were presented to Nikolay Makivesky, Deputy Prime
Minister of Kazakhstan and Director of the Kazakh Committee of Emergencies.

<P>
The United Nations University (UNU) will hold a symposium on &quot;Peace
and Security&quot; as part of its project on the United Nations
System in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century (UN21), at the UNU Headquarters
in Tokyo from 8-9 November 1996. The purpose of the symposium
is to enable researchers working on this multi-year project to
present and discuss their initial research results.
<P>
The UN21 project analyses the role of international organizations,
searching for next century's best UN model. It is divided into
five actor-specific research groups: states and sovereignty, global
citizenship, market forces, regional arrangements, and international
organizations. Each year, research groups focus on a specific
theme - this year's is peace and security.
<P>
The UNU's UN21 project is unique. While others may be contemplating
the UN's future, the UNU has already established a research framework,
gathered prominent scholars from diverse backgrounds, and selected
specialized UN practitioners to discuss the UN of the past and
to formulate what the UN of the future should be.

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman"> Terrorism is growing
in intensity, scale, and threat<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the bombings of the Olympics
in Atlanta, the New York World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City
Federal Building, and Pan American 103, and terrorist acts in
the Balkans, Somalia, Liberia, Colombia, and Japan terrorism is
now global, destructive, and difficult to prevent. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Within the last three years: Chechen
crime groups may have been involved in the theft of six kilograms
of enriched uranium recovered in Istanbul. The Czech Government
intercepted a shipment of 6.6 pounds of enriched uranium from
a nuclear smuggling ring; the German Government found six tenths
of a pound of plutonium in Munich on a Lufthansa plane from Moscow.
German authorities reported 276 nuclear smuggling incidents in
1994.   What is the destination of these materials?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The weapons that may become available
to terrorists, e.g. nuclear and biological weapons, and have become
available, e.g. chemical weapons and computer sabotage make the
threat particularly ominous. The arsenals of the United States,
Russia and many other nations contain biological and chemical
weapons that also have massive killing potential. The uses of
such weapons by terrorists is not hard to imagine - the subway
gas attack in Tokyo is a<B> </B>tragic example. These materials
need not be stolen since their manufacture requires easily obtainable
raw materials and conventional technology.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Possibilities for the future: extortion
against a government or corporation, retaliation by terrorists
for perceived insults, use by renegade governments or revolutionary
groups to achieve power. Technological terrorism, especially large&#173;scale
sabotage through the Internet, might lead to the call for a new
police role.<BR>

Up-date on the...
MILLENNIUM PROJECT
American Council/United Nations University
<P>
<P>
After a three-year feasibility study, the Millennium Project formally began with a
meeting of the Planning Committee and Sponsors at the World Bank in
Washington, D.C. February 14, 1996. A draft of the first year's plan for the
Millennium Project had been circulated among the 26 Member AC/UNU/Planning
Committee prior to the meeting. The Committee endorsed the first year's plan that
follows the core activities as documented in the Millennium Project Feasibility
Report (available on Internet at <http:\\www.tmn.com\wfs\phase3.htm> in draft
form.  Alternatively, a nicely laid-out and edited print version can be ordered at 
$5 for postage and handling in North America and $10 for postage and handling
elsewhere).  
<P>
Currently, the Global ''Look-Out'' panel of Millennium Project participants (about
300) is being established.  They will be asked to provide observations and
judgments about developments that suggest future world issues and opportunities.
It is a three round activity, similar to a Delphi, except that convergence is not
necessary, but the identification of a range is issues, consequences, goals, and
strategies is the purpose instead.
<P>
The 200 people from 50 countries listed in the feasibility study will be the initial
basis for this panel, and additional suggestions are welcome at this time. A second
panel, composed of self-selected people who signed-up for the Project's public
listserv and or responded to open invitations on the Project's homepage on Internet
<http://nko.mhpcc.edu/millennium/Millennium_Project.html> will also be able 
to participate.  
<P>
Secondly, major global scenarios and ''mini'' scenarios are being identified and
classified in a unique system that allows for their integration a listing of assumptions.
The Project welcomes your suggestions about recently published global scenarios
that you think should be considered for inclusion in the Project's data base of 
important global scenarios. 
<P>
During the second round of the Look-Out questionnaire will also build some
''mini-scenarios'' or ''vignettes'' as a means of describing changes identified in
the first round.
<P>
The Project will also scan literature and other sources for emergent trends, 
questions, issues, and potentially significant potential events. AC/UNU 
Interns have begun identifying and entering items.  The University of 
Houston/Clearlake Program for the Study of the Future has expressed 
interest in taking on additional responsibilities in this activity. The
Maui High Performance Computer Center is considering the possibility of
supporting the Project by developing new kinds of software agents for scanning
Internet.  Experiments to include public input to the scanning process will also be
explored. 
<P>
There will be a mid-year briefing of the work in progress at the July meeting of
the World Future Society.  All of the work for the year will be integrated into
a ''State of the Future Report'' in print, on-line, possibly on CD-ROM, and 
other media possibilities will be explored.
<P>
Millennium Project Nodes have been established in Moscow (focusing on 
frontiers of futures research methodology),  Cairo (focusing on advanced
training in futures research), and Washington, D.C. (Project coordination),
then possibly in Montevideo for regional futures in Latin America. Some interest
has also be expressed in Beijing, Paris, and Tokyo. 
<P>
The Millennium Project is under the auspices of the American Council for the
United Nations University.  In addition to AC/UNU, the Project is being
performed with support from the Smithsonian Institution and The Futures Group. 
Initial financial support for general operations has come from Ford Motor
Company and Monsanto and a number of other companies are considering
sponsorship.  A portion of the Project's methodology work is supported by the
Ministry of Science and Technology, Russian Federation and computer support
from the Maui High Performance Computer Center, Hawaii.
<P>
Frontiers of Futures Studies: A Handbook of Tools and Methods produced by the
Millennium Project with funding from UNDP is expected to be available in April
and available for $29.95 from AC/UNU, UNDP, and WFS.  The first round of 
the Look-Out study is expected to be circulated in April.

Fresh water is becoming scarce in localized areas of the world.
 <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Lack of adequate waste management
in most places in the world; excessive consumption and contamination
of water aquifers; excessive farming on marginal lands, and population
and urbanization trends are affecting the availability &#173;
and future expectations of availability &#173; of fresh water.
The countries facing scarcity include: eleven African countries,
nine Middle Eastern countries, northern China (including Beijing
and the agricultural lands surrounding it); India (including New
Delhi and thousands of rural villages); Mexico (including Mexico
City and irrigated farmlands in northern Mexico); and portions
of the Western United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While methods exist to purify salt
water, these methods are expensive. To further complicate the
situation, agricultural uses far exceed other uses of water and
with increased demand for food, pressure to use water for agriculture
can only increase. Agricultural land is being lost to brackish
conditions due to  long&#173;term geological trends in some regions.
The possibility, speed and consequences of global warming are
uncertain, but at the very least, changes in rainfall patterns
will undermine effectiveness of existing water control, storage
and distribution facilities, and widen areas affected by scarcity.
As population growth and urbanization proceed, competition between
urban and agricultural uses of water will grow.  <BR>

The gap in living standards between the rich and poor promises
to become   more extreme and divisive.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the World Bank, low
income countries' average annual per capita income grew 3.4% from
1986 to 1994 compared to 1.9% for high income countries.  One
might conclude that both the rich are getting richer and the poor
are getting richer, but that would be misleading.  Excluding India
and China, the low-income countries fell by 1.1%.  Hence, while
some poorer countries are getting richer per capita, incomes in
most of the low income countries either dropped or did not grow.
According to the UNDP's Human Development Report 1996: &quot;Nearly
90 countries are worse off economically than they were ten years
ago...the gap in per capita income between the industrial and
developing worlds tripled from 1960 to 1993, from US$5,700 to
$15,400...Today the net worth of the world's 358 richest billionaires
is equal to the combined income of the poorest 45% of the world's
population - 2.3 billion people.&quot;  Besides the moral implications,
this issue could lead to increased instability and conflict. 
<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One respondent argued that &quot;by
2025 more than 90 per cent of the worlds population with be in
the current Third World&quot; &#173; which will be expanding rapidly

The Threat of New and Re-emerging Diseases and Immune Micro- 
organisms<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Recent outbreaks of bubonic plague
in India, ebola virus in Africa, and drug-resistant tuberculosis
in America is causing the world to re-think its public health
policies.  Increasing mass migrations and international travel
spread disease more rapidly than in the past; increasing urbanization
and population density accelerate and intensify this issue. Furthermore,
the widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in the evolution
of micro-organisms that are resistant to antibiotics.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Infectious diseases spreading
in US hospitals kill more each year than all Americans killed
in Vietnam...The heaviest concentration of pathogens is found
in the developing world...The progress of pathogens to adapt to
our arsenal of medicines promises to be the fight of our species...It
is a trend that holds the capacity to bring life as we know it
to a grinding halt...A handful of microbes can be stopped at the
boarder but the vast majority cannot,&quot; U.S. Congressional
testimony April 25, 1996 by Chuck Woolery, National Council for
International Health. In addition, the threat of biological terrorism
is now plausible.<BR>

  Increasing severity of religious, ethnic, and racial conflicts
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New">Religious, ethnic, and racial hostilities
held in check by the Cold War have now emerged as a major theme
of armed struggle. Many groups feel a sense of persecution and
isolation.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Times New"> Rapid rates of
technological, political, and social change cause many to fear
the future, giving rise to feelings of being &quot;left behind,&quot;
and the need to re-establish fundamental principals.  Increases
in regional and inter-regional migrations are provoking political
and economic tensions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New">The recent successes of other separatist
movements, perceived injustices, and long held animosities, all
fuel the fire.  Extremists can focus the media through violence.

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is an increasing need for effective
global decision making, responsibility (especially moral responsibility),
action, and results. Today many believe it is possible to shape
the future, rather than simply prepare for a future which is a
linear extrapolation of the present or a product of chance or
fate.  Yet, the globalization, complexity, number, and frequency
of choices seem to grow beyond the ability to know and decide.
 Skills development in concept formulation and communication seem
to be decreasing relative to the requirements of an increasingly
complicated world.  Can life become too complex for the world's
institutions to manage?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The world's technological base has
expanded, and the conventional tools for decision making have
advanced.  Yet, such &quot;advancements&quot; are poorly distributed
despite the size and speed of computers and decision making models.
 Facts are still elusive; the moral bases for decision making
are rarely considered explicitly.  Futures issues are apt to be
tougher than ever: global warming and the ability to modify human
genetic structure are two examples. Many people do not understand
or trust science.  Others believe that there is far more to learn
in physics and other disciplines, and that the frontiers of knowledge
are unbounded. There may be a plethora of information, but the
question remains: how can humankind best incorporate such information
into knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom?<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times New Roman">ISSUE 8:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4>  The changing status of women<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Gertrude Mongella, Secretary General
of the UN Fourth World Conference on Women, summarized the need
to change the status of women as follows::  &quot;One of the biggest
problems for women worldwide is the issue of  equality.  If everybody
thinks women are not equal, then they will  be treated unequally
everywhere, in the community, in the nation, at the international
level.  This is the mother of all the  problems ... if we are
to succeed, we must get to a level where  the only differences
between a man and a woman are their capacities as people, not
because one is a woman and one is a  man.&quot;   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The striving for equality crosses
cultural, geographical, racial,  class, religious, and ethnic
boundaries.  Yet, the very nature of  equality has different meanings
in different parts of the world, and in some parts, it is a matter
of fierce debate.   In the developing  world,  equality  means
reducing the number of  women living in extreme poverty and violence,
providing women with  access to resources, land, and credit, increasing
female literacy,  and in some countries, giving women the right
to participate in the  political decision making process.   As
the status of women improves, birthrates decline and the welfare
of nations improve. For example, Barbados is ranked the highest
in basic needs indexes compared to other Latin American and Caribbean
countries; Barbados also has the highest adult female literacy
at 99%,  and the highest percentage of female participation in
the labor force. (International Fund for Agricultural Development,
1993).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In addition to the issues of equality
for women  in developing countries, economic and social barriers
exist in industrialized countries as well. Although diminishing,
wage disparity and limits on access to executive power pose particular
problems, especially in corporations.     </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Worldwide, the overall status of
women is improving, and there are significant breakthroughs. 
 In the developing countries, the last 20 years has seen women
advancing twice as fast as men in literacy and school enrollment,
women's life expectancy increasing by nine years, and maternal
mortality rate has nearly halved worldwide. Nevertheless, women
have a long way to go as the implementation of the Platform for
Action, passed by the UN Fourth  World Conference on Women in
Beijing 1995, has only just begun. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times New Roman">ISSUE 7:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">Adverse interactions
between the growth of population and economic   growth with environmental
quality and natural resources<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Current world population is 5.8 billion
and, according to UN projections may reach 10-12 billion by the
middle of the next century. Although the population growth rate
is slowing, the numbers of people being added to the world every
year are higher than at any other time in history. Urban concentration
is growing at an even faster rate. With population growing and
becoming more concentrated, environmental problems such as safe
drinking water will grow and have not only local,  but international
consequences.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In addition, most countries are attempting
to expand their economies and if successful, per capita income
will increase for most people in the world. With such increases
come greater consumption of natural resources and energy. Many
countries have demonstrated that energy consumption need not grow
in direct proportion to economic growth, but huge growth is expected
nonetheless, as the economies and populations of developing countries
expand. Burning of indigenous coal by China and India, for example,
could add appreciably to the world's pollution load. (Note, however,
that the developed countries consume more raw materials and energy
 by far than the poorer countries are expected to do throughout
the next century.)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While some experts argue that a sustainable
future requires slower economic growth, others point out that
technology and economic incentives have always provided solutions
to increasing demand, such as centralized wastewater processing
systems. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Although the outcomes of the complex
interactions among population, economic growth, environmental
quality, and natural resources are uncertain, the stakes are high.

population is at its peak and growing; food, water, education,
housing, medical care must grow apace</FONT><B>. <BR>
<BR>

</B>
<P>
World population now stands at about 5.7 billion and rate of growth
is about 1.6 percent per year. About 90 million people are added
each year and it is projected that there will be 10 billion people
by 2030 &#173; whether the needs of these people can be met without
economic, political, or environmental upheavals is uncertain.
Urban populations are growing much faster, especially in developing
countries where urban population grow five fold between 1950 -
1990 to 1.5 billion and is projected by the U.N. to grow to 4.4
billion by 2025, at which point nearly two-thirds of the developing
world will live in cities. Hence, most of this growth is occurring
where people have the least means to support such growth.<BR>

<P>
In most countries, population growth rates have slowed as a result
of increasing GDP/capita, increasing education of women, increasing
use of birth control measures, particularly condoms, government
encouraged family planning programs, and the rise of feminism.
Infant mortality is high in poor countries and the causes of childhood
death &#173; infectious diseases and diarrhea primarily - are
presently curable at low cost. The maturing elderly of the Third
World will create a special problem in social services (68% of
the projected 1.1 billion people over the age of 60 by the year
2020 are expected to be in developing nations). <BR>

<P>
While most demographers and economists see population growth as
causing a potential burden for the world leading possibly to instability
and violence and the growth of the number of people living in
poverty, some see the added people as a resource, both intellectual
and physical. Despite the enormous growth in population of the
last two decades, economies have pretty well kept pace and in
general, today's problems include surpluses as well as scarcities,
and in many respects, environments have proven to be resilient
after improved policy.<BR>

Consequences of Economic Growth<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The driving force generated by the
interdependence between economic growth and technological innovation
has been the most significant engine of change for the last 200
years.  Economic growth is responsible for changing the standard
of living for most people in the world.  It is shaping  the physical
and social environment, creating new global business relationships,
changing the nature of work, employment, and expectations about
the role and responsibilities of governments.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The consequences of economic growth
is subject to pessimistic and optimistic interpretations.  There
is pessimism over the nature and number of jobs, widening income
gaps, trade disputes, energy consumptions, political disorder,
environmental degradation, migrations from lesser developed countries,
technological displacement, conflict between societal and economic
aims, and uneven distribution of wealth among nations. And there
is equally intense optimism over economic growth's production
of food, shelter, clothing, health care, and knowledge; the potential
of new technologies, improved environmental management and global
information access. During the same period of economic growth,
infant mortality has fallen, life expectancy has risen, and living
standards for hundreds of millions have improved.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The globalization and liberalization
of national economies promises to accelerate the forces of global
economic growth. The WTO's International Trade Tends and Statistics
Report states that in 1995, &quot;the volume of world merchandise
exports expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two decades.&quot;
 The increase in trade was nearly triple the growth in output
in 1994, and nearly triple the growth in 1993.  Will the intensity
and scale of these forces contradict the goals of sustainability?
 The United Nations Conferences on Environment and Development
in Rio de Janeiro addressed this issue, and concluded that although
the link between economic growth and environmental degradation
is unquestionable, economic growth is, nevertheless, necessary
to resolving environmental problems in the future; the sheer magnitude
of these problems are quite costly.  Considering such consequences
of growth are central to the building of economic growth strategies
for a more sustainable human future.    <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times New Roman">ISSUE 13</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">:
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">Aging Nuclear Power
Plants<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All nuclear power plants are aging
and will have to be decommissioned when their lifetime is expended.
Techniques for decommissioning are not well in hand, and long
term storage of decommissioned plants and materials will be required.
In addition, some plants (e.g. Chernobyl) use technologies and
control systems that have higher than standard risks.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nuclear power plants are designed
to operate for a period of between 30 and 50 years; after that
time, the plants have to be dismantled and the sites made safe
for other uses. More than 300 facilities around the world will
have to be decommissioned by 2010. Decommissioning may also be
required in the case of an accident or nuclear plant closing for
other reasons. The International Atomic Energy Agency defines
three stages of decommissioning: Storage with Surveillance (spent
fuel is removed and liquid systems are drained, estimated time
is 5 years); Restricted Site Release (buildings and shielding
are dismantled); and Unrestricted Site Use (the reactor itself
is dismantled).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To date, about 70 commercial reactors
have been removed from operation. A 250 MW unit in East Germany
was decommissioned by removing all nuclear systems from the site
and the site is now used for agriculture. In Canada, at the site
of three retired gas cooled reactors, Stage 3 has been delayed
50 years. In England, two 138 MW reactors have been closed; it
has been proposed that a containment building be built around
the buildings for a storage period of 100 years.  In the US one
closed plant is in a safe storage mode for 19 years and the other,
opting for immediate dismantling,  is expected to be cleared in
8 years. Reactor 2 at Three Mile Island required 14 years of clean
up and is in storage until 2014 when the adjacent reactor will
also be shut down. International programs for sharing information
about decommissioning have already been established.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the decommissioning of nuclear
power plants and the accelerating energy requirements, new electric
production will become far more important that generally appreciated.
As a result nuclear power generation capacity may be expanded
in the future. This electric energy source does not add greenhouse
gasses. Developing economies will certainly require more energy.
 Fresh water can be produced from salt or brackish water using
electricity. The radioactive wastes may yet become a resource.
Nevertheless, long term storage of radioactive materials will
be required and vigilant security will be necessary to prevent
the theft and illicit use .  <BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With vast sums of money from illegal
drugs and other sources, organized crime is buying the technical
know-how to generate even more profits in new ventures ranging
from information fraud to human organ and arms traffic. Examples
include: 1991 bank fraud of US$2.2 billion; telephone fraud $4
billion; credit card fraud $1.5 billion. Financial institutions
in the United States alone transfer over one trillion dollars
via computer networks daily, this and other international financial
flows provide tempting targets. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Power vacuums across the world created
by the fall of Soviet authority and weakened national governments
in other regions are being filled in part by new forms of criminal
power. Indecisive or untimely responses are likely to encourage
an expansion of these criminal trends. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A generation of children has been
exposed to violence and criminal behavior on TV and in other media
at an early age; this may increase the potential for later criminal
behavior and create a siege mentality among law-abiding citizens.
 Some people fed up with crime demand restrictions on civil liberties,
greater use of the death penalty, and increased government surveillance
in an attempt to rid society of criminals and weapons. <BR>

In 1995, more people than ever before, 4.7 million, were infected
by HIV. The number of new cases of AIDS also set a record: just
under 2 million. About 1.7 million people died from AIDS in 1995,
also a record (1). The prevalence of HIV and AIDS is believed
to be significantly underreported; the table below is a best estimate
of newly reported cases of HIV. The number of cases has doubled
since 1991.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The disease is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa
where infection rates exceed 25% in a number of major cities.
The possible consequences of this epidemic in Africa &#173; even
without further spread &#173; are dreadful: drastic reduction
in the number of bright young people who would ordinarily take
over leadership positions; fleeing tourism; acceleration of brain
drain; collapsing population growth. According to National Academy
of Sciences (USA), &quot;By the year 2010, demographers estimate
that AIDS will have lowered life expectancy from 66 to 33 years
in Zambia, from 70 to 40 in Zimbabwe, from 68 to 40 in Kenya,
and from 59 to 31 years in Uganda.&quot; (3)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The growth rate of new cases has apparently peaked
in sub-Saharan Africa, but new cases in Southeast Asia now exceed
those occurring in Africa. Social marketing programs focusing
on abstinence and safe sex and are meeting some measure of success.
The United Nations began its UNAIDS program in early 1996 to concentrate
funding and international attention on programs for developing
countries. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Yet, the virus flourishes. Variants of the virus
which had been confined to distinct geographical locations are
now appearing elsewhere (3); if a vaccine can be found for one
strain it might not protect against another. From a scientific
standpoint, new information is being gained from research in dozen
of countries, about the nature and etiology of the disease, but
a vaccine or effective therapy remains elusive. Progress in this
field includes a new test for the virus that is 20 times more
sensitive than previous tests (4), direct measurement of HIV viral
load (the lower the viral burden the longer the delay in developing
AIDS) (5), and the use of protease inhibitors in combination with
other drugs slow the progression of AIDS (6). <BR>

Up-date ueber das.......... 
<P>
Millennium-Projekt
<P>

Nach einer dreijaehrigen Feasibilitie-Studie wurde am 14. Februar 1996, im Rahmen eines Treffens
des Plannungskommittees und der Sponsoren in der Weltbank in Washington, D.C., das
Millenniumprojekt ins Leben gerufen. Ein Entwurf des Projektplanes fuer das erste Jahr war dem
Planungskommittee zuvor zugestellt wurden und die diesbezueglichen Kommenntare waren
konstruktiv und hilfreich. 
<P>
Das Kommittee verabschiedete den Erst-Jahres-Plan. Die geplanten Aktivitaeten sind analog zu den
Aktivitaeten, die im Bericht der Millennium Feasibilitie-Studie skizziert wurden. Dieser Bericht ist
sowohl auf dem Internet (http:\\ www.tmn.com\wfs\phase3.htm), als auch in gedruckter Version,
gegen eine Bearbeitungsgebuehr von $5 fuer Nord-Amerika, bzw. $10 fuer den Rest der Welt, ueber
den Postweg beziehbar.
<P>
Zusammenfassend; im Laufe des ersten Jahres sollen:
<P><ul>
<li> globale "look out"- Diskussionsrunden etabliert werden. Die Teilnehmer sind dazu aufgerufen,
generelle Beobachtungen und Vorhersagen ueber Entwicklungen abzugeben, die von globaler
Zukunftsrelevanz sein koennten.
Die 200 Teilnehmer aus 50 Laendern, die in der Fesibilitie-Studie genannt sind, bilden die
Anfangsbasis, zusaetzliche Vorschlaege sind willkommen. Eine zweite Diskussionsrunde wird sich
aus Teilnehmern zusammensetzen, die der Einladung auf der homepage folgen. 
<P>
<li> globale Szenarios identifiziert werden. Das Projekt begruesst Informationen ueber kuerzlich
publizierte Szenarien, die in die data-base des Projektes ueber globale Szenarien miteingeschlosen sein
sollten.
<P>
<li> "Mini-Szenarios" und "Vignettes" identifiziert, bzw. entwickelt werden. Diese sollen dazu dienen,
globale Veraenderungen zu beschreiben, die im Rahmen der Disskusionsrunden beurteilt werden.
<P>
<li> Literatur und andere Informationsmateralien bezueglich der Identifikation von sich entwickelnde
Trends, Fragen und Themen durchgearbeitet werden. Diese Aufgabe wird derzeitig bereits von
AC/UNU Praktikanten bearbeitet. Die University of Houston/Clearlake Program for the Study of
Future hat ihr Interesse an einer naeheren Zusammenarbeit in diesem Bereich ausgedrueckt. Das Maui
High Performance Computer Center stellt Ueberlegungen an, ob es das Projekt durch die
Entwicklung neuer Software zum scannen des Internets, unterstuetzen kann.
<P>
<li> die Ergebnisse und Erkenntnisse der dargestellten Aktivitaeten in einem "State of the Future Report"
integriert werden. Dieser soll auf vielfaeltige Weise zugaenglich gemacht werden (Druck, CD-ROM,
Internet, etc.). 
</ul><P>
Parallel zu diesen Aktivitaeten, werden die Moeglichkeiten fuer die Entwicklung des Millennium-Projektes in Moskau (der Fokus liegt hier auf dem Methodenbereich der Zukunftsforschung) und in
Kairo (fokusiert im Bereich Schulung in Zukunftsforschung) weiter verfolgt, desweiteren soll
moeglicherweise Montevideo fuer die Erforschung der regionalen Zukunft (Suedamerika) in Betracht
gezogen werden. Interesse wurde also in Peking, Paris und Tokyo geaeussert.
<P>
Das Millennium-Projekt ist unter der Verantwortung des American Council for the United Nations
University. UNU/WIDER, mussten das Projekt, das sie waehrend der Feasibilitie-Studie betreuten,
aus finanziellen und personellen Engpaessen heraus abgeben. Zuzueglich zum AC/UNU wird das
Projekt vom Smithonian-Institut und The Futures Group unterstuetzt. Die Ford Motorwerke und
Monsanto haben das Projekt finanziell gefoerdert, eine Anzahl weitere Sponsoren haben finanzielle
Unterstuetzung in Aussicht gestellt. Ein Teil der Methodenarbeit des Projektes wird vom Ministerium
fuer Wissenschaft und Technik der Russischen Federation gefoerdert. Unterstuetzung im
Computerbereich kommt vom Maui High Performance Computer Center, Hawaii.

<B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times New Roman">ISSUE 15:</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman"> Changing Work,
Unemployment, Leisure, and Underemployment<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Automation, globalization of business,
regional trade agreements, the shifting locus of low labor costs,
improved productivity, the aging of the population, and the drive
for improved corporate efficiency are causing changes in the labor
forces of almost all nations. The changes include: increasing
percent of service sector employment while manufacturing percentage
is falling;  the ratio of retired relative to active workers is
growing almost anywhere, placing an economic burden on workers
in the future; the displacement of many low-skilled, well-paid
workers in the developed world occurring simultaneously with a
shortage of people with adequate skills; the inability of some
developing countries to use developed technologies effectively.
 The power of technology in developing  nations is limited by
availability of trained people.  Income disparities within some
developing nations precludes access for such training (the ratio
of the richest 20% to poorest 20% is 31:1 in Brazil, while in
Germany it is about 5:1).  Underemployment and isolation of women
from the cash economy remains an important issue in developing
countries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fundamental shift in how the
&quot;world's work gets done&quot; is creating a truly global
labor force, yet lack of training and access divides labor into
those capable of performing high paying work, and those who are
not. New technologies, the continuing drive for higher productivity,
the global search for low cost labor, and the aggressive movement
into markets that promise the most growth, like China, are forces
that are changing who works and the work they perform. These forces
will change, displace, underemploy, and unemploy anyone caught
unprepared.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the transition from an industrial
to a service economy, the  rise of  the newly industrialized countries
(like Mexico and Indonesia),  and the displacement of workers,
structural unemployment in the form of labor surplus is a potential
problem worldwide.   If world demand for a workforce is significantly
less than the supply,  will there then be more creative uses of
leisure,  or will chronic, turbulent, destabilizing under and
unemployment result?  It is far from clear what form the new world
of work will ultimately take, but there is much to be concerned
about, and excited by, in the transition that is taking place
ahead. It will affect lifestyles, leisure, quality of life and
working relationships worldwide.    <BR>

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman"> Information Technology's
Promise and Perils<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Interactive cyberspace has become
an important new and unprecedented medium for civilization.  Prices
for telecommunications, computers, and software are continuing
to fall while capacity grows and these systems are spreading throughout
poorer regions of the world.  Email and other gateways connected
virtually all countries by the end of 1994.  AT&amp;T's Africa
One Project and the Global Information Infrastructure vision of
U.S. Vice President Al Gore are expected to accelerate Internet
growth in developing countries. By the year 2000, the Internet
Society expects 187 million hosts connected world-wide, 2 million
networks outside the U.S., 2.5 billion users, and more traffic
than voice telephone.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Internet is vast, confusing,
and unorganized to many people, but exciting and self-organizing
to others. It is both staggering in scope and trivial in some
content.  It is expected to become simpler, more accessible, and
faster within the next decade.  It is already one of the most
powerful agents of change in the world, affecting education, science,
health care, and business. It is becoming the first location for
the discussion of new ideas, publishing, advertising, and commerce.
 To some developing countries, it will provide the means to accelerate
their development processes, provide access to much of the world's
knowledge, and become the medium for participating in the global
economy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Pornography and other influences
deemed culturally unacceptable are creating hostility toward the
free growth of the Internet.  In addition, regulatory constraints
on content have been proposed in many countries.  Currently, automation
is displacing routine human behavior, giving rise to the possibility
of economic growth with less employment.  If new kinds of enterprises
and employment are not created to address computer and automation-induced
unemployment, the unemployed and underemployed could well create
an anti-technology  sentiment and political crises. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the same time, sabotage through
the Internet, should be expected: credit and bank fraud, computer
viruses, other forms of criminal manipulation and even information
warfare by individuals, groups, corporations, and nations are
possible.  Privacy and property rights are also issues of concern.
 Authenticity of information will be difficult to establish. 
Despite these and other problems, information technology is </FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times">creating
a planetary &quot;nervous system&quot; necessary for improving
the prospects for humanity.<BR>

<P>Une mise à jour du...
Projet Millénaire

Après une étude de faisabilité de trois ans, le Projet Millénaire a commencé!
<p>
Le Projet Millénaire a commencé officiellement avec une réunion du Service de Planning et les sponsors au World Bank à Washington, D.C. le quatorze février 1996.  Une ébauche du plan de première année pour le Projet Millénaire a été circulé parmi le Service de Planning et leurs commentaires étaient utiles et d'un grand soutien.
<p>
Le Service a approuvé le plan de première année qui suit les activités principales comme elles étaient documentées dans Le Rapport de faisabilité du Projet Millénaire (disponible sur Internet à <http:\\www.tmn.com\wfs\phase3.htm> en version préliminaire.  Comme alternative, une version imprimée qui est formatée et révisée peut être commander à $5.00 pour les tarifs postaux dans l'Amérique du Nord, et à $10.00 pour les tarifs postaux ailleurs).
<p>
Très brièvement, la première année va:<p>
1)  Etablir un comité de surveillance global des participants du Projet Millénaire qui seront demander de fournir des observations et des jugements concernant des développements qui suggèrent des questions et des opportunités mondiales de l'avenir.  Les 200 personnes de 50 pays inscrites sur l'étude de faisabilité seront la base initiale pour ce comité, et les suggestions additionnelles sont bienvenue à ce point.  Un deuxième comité de volontiers abandonnés au "list-serv" publique du Projet répond aux invitations ouvertes sur le "homepage" du Projet sur Internet.
<p>
2)  Identifier les grandes scénarios mondiaux.  Le Projet accueillit vos suggestions à propos des scénarios mondiaux récemment publiés que vous trouvez devraient être considérer pour inclusion dans la base de données des scénarios mondiaux du Projet.
<p>
3)  Identifier et construire des "petit-scénarios" ou des "vignettes" comme un moyen de décrire les changements comme une partie du questionnaire qu'on utilisera avec les comités de surveillance.
<p>
4)  Scruter de la littérature et d'autre sources pour les cours, les questions, les problèmes, et les événements d'importance potentiels émergeants.  Les stagiaires du CA/UNU ont commencé à identifier et à entrer des questions.  Le Programme de l'Université de Houston/Clearlake pour l'Etude de l'Avenir a exprimé un intérêt de prendre des responsabilités en plus dans cette activité.  Le Maui High Performance Computer Center considère la possibilité de soutenir le Projet avec le développement d'un nouveau type de software pour scruter le Internet.  Les expériences qui inclurent des réponses publiques au processus de scruter seront aussi explorées.
<p>
5)  Intégrer les résultats des ces activités avec un "Rapport de l'Etat de l'Avenir", imprimé, "on-line", et peut-être sur CD-ROM, et d'autre possibilités de media seront explorer.
<p>
6)  Simultanément, des explorations continueront pour le développement des Noeuds Projet Millénaire d'abord à Moscow, (concentrant sur les frontières de la méthodologie de recherche de l'avenir) et à Cairo (concentrant sur l'entraînement avancé de recherche de l'avenir), et puis, peut-être  à Montevideo pour les avenirs régionales de l'Amérique Latine.  De l'intérêt a été aussi exprimé à Beijing et Tokyo.
<p>
Le Projet Millénaire est sous les auspices du Consul Américain pour l'Université des Nations Unies.  UNU/WIDER, la base antérieure du Projet, a un budget et un personnel réduit, ce qui fait qu'il est impossible de fournir autant du soutien que pendant l'étude de faisabilité.  En plus du CA/UNU, le Projet est exécuté avec le soutien de l'Institut Smithsonian et le Groupe des Futures.  Le Ford Motor Company, et Monsanto ont donné le soutien financier initial pour les opérations générales, et il y a plusieurs entreprises qui considèrent un patronage actuellement.  Une portion du travail méthodologique du Projet  est soutenue par le Ministre de Science et de Technologie, la Fédération russe, et le soutien informatique du Maui High Performance Computer Center, Hawaii.
<p>
Vos pensées sont les bienvenues.

<p><hr><p>
<font size=+2>ROUND 2 QUESTIONNAIRE<p><b>SECTION 2</b></font><p>
<font size=+1>FULL-TEXT OF DEVELOPMENTS</font></center><p>
<br>
The second round of the 1996 Global Look-Out questionnaire comes in two sections.  You
should already have Section 1. Section 2 includes the full text of developments in only one of the
six Millennium Project domains.  Selection of the domain sent to you was based on your first
round responses, resume, publications, previous expressions of interest and or our best judgment. 
If you want to comment and add to the full text of developments in other domains, please
download them from the Millennium Project's home page:
<i>http//nko.mhpcc.edu/millennium/Millennium_Project.html</i> or request them from the
Project's coordinating office.<p>

In this second section, you are asked for comments, improvements, or additions to the material
submitted by yourself and others in the first round.  You do not have to comment on every
development in this domain, just those developments that are important to you and to which
you can contribute new consquences, strategies, and references. <p>

You can respond in several ways:<p>

1. If you received the material via email or downloaded it from the homepage, you can simply
insert you YOUR COMMENTS IN CAPITAL LETTERS or in
>some other way to identify your additions into the text and submit the whole domain back via
email >to<i> jglenn@igc.org.</i><p>

2.  You need not include the full text in your response.  You can simply write the reference
number for the development followed by your additions and email, fax, or mail it back.<p>

<hr><p>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>Information, Communications</b></i><p></font></center>

15. <b>Development: </b>Extremely smart and flexible computers; real artificial intelligence<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Better problem solving. Some people feel that humans are
inferior to
computers.<br>
<b>References and Notes:</b>
<p>

111. <b>Development: </b>Availability of continuous speech, user-independent, computer voice
input
systems making possible a new sort of human to machine interface that requires no training.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Computers that listen and speak, like HAL in 2001, but more
importantly, computers that reduce the requirement for training.<br>
<b>References and Notes: </b>
                                 <p>
                                  
136. <b>Development: </b>The spread of the Internet. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>While the present status of the Internet includes a great deal of
confusion and information overload, it is likely to settle down within the next decade to become
one of
the most powerful agents of change throughout the world, affecting education, science, health
care and
commerce profoundly.<br>
<b>Goal: </b>Establish a new agency of the United Nations whose mission it would be to
regulate the
use of this new utility, to foster its application toward human development, and particularly to
exploit its
potential of raising the standard of living in the developing countries.<br>

<center><font size=+1><i><b>Biomedicine and Psychiatry</b></i><p></font></center>

6. <b>Development: </b> Development of brain-like intelligent systems using neural networks, to
help
achieve a more functional understanding of human intelligence.<br>
<b>Description: </b>New designs for intelligent control are emerging in the neural network field
which
promise real brain-like intelligent systems, can help us to achieve a more functional understanding
of
intelligence as it exists in the human mind, but, on the downside, make scenarios like "Terminator
2" far
more plausible than most scientists would believe today.<br>
<b>Details:</b> I would prefer to leave that to the citations. This is the area where I have the
greatest
personal credibility, however, for a variety of reasons. A better understanding of the human mind
could
have some very vast implications, which I leave up to you. Fortunately, most of this work does
not have
"Terminator" kinds of implications.<br>
<b>References:</b> Assuming it has not been badly tinkered with, we have a Web page giving
some
details. Click on "Neural Networks" under: <i>www.nsf.gov/eng/ecs/ecs.htm.</i>  That in turn
cites
some published papers. There is also a more recent paper on the connections to neuroscience by
myself.
in K.Pribram, ed., <i>Learning as Self-Organization,</i> Erlbaum, in press. With luck, some of
the
papers themselves may be up on the web fairly soon.       <p>
                                  
47. <b>Development: </b>Personal health history records in the form of intelligent credit cards --
available to everybody, linked to a central national computer with data bank, medical
practitioners,
hospitals and laboratories have on-line links with this central computer.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Complete and perfect record linkage, reduction of unnecessary
medical
investigations and other procedures; possibility raisingstandards of diagnosis and care by applying
intelligent automatic peer review; possibility of abusing medical (and other personal) secrets; the
scheme
available to "haves" only; possibility of applying effectively and efficiently widespread public
health
interventions;<br>
<b>Goals: </b>Full computerization of personal medical and public health information<br>
<b>Domain: </b>1, 3<br>
<b>References and Notes:</b>                   <p>
                                  
62. <b>Development: </b>Symbiosis with the computer - even via the keyboard.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Individuals will develop a 'personality' (especially in terms of 
'memories') which is part internal and part on the computer - with the line between these
increasingly
blurred. This will result in a 'richness' of personality - greater in scope (and capacity) and
distributed
across space. At the fringes it might start to merge with the personalities of others (making group
identity
even more powerful).
On the other hand, it poses problems in terms of the potential for new neuroses to emerge.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>To enrich the powers of the individual, especially in terms of memory<br>
<b>Domain: </b>3, 7 (social)<br>
<b>References and Notes: </b>The origin of this work is Ian Pearson's work.<p>
                                  
104. <b>Development: </b>New understanding of the functioning of the brain, leading, perhaps
to the
understanding of self consciousness; integration of knowledge about neurotransmitters, the site of
certain
brain functions, and psycho pharmaceuticals.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Improvements in education, propaganda, training, memory,
diseases of
the brain and mind, understanding of consciousness, and perhaps a "Genome Project" of the brain,
cataloging the myriad interconnections of the neurons of the brain.<br>
<b>References and Notes: </b>
                                 <p>
                                  
123. <b>Development: </b>Ability to change basic human characteristics, through genetic
engineering
or chemical interventions.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>1) Much fear and efforts to prevent its use; 2) If used,
inconceivable
changes beyond our present imagination.<br>
<b>References and Notes:</b>                <p><hr><p>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>Search for Extra Terrestrial
Intelligence</b></i><p></font></center>

16. <b>Development: </b>Successful scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence; contact
with a
small probe near the earth and detection of encyclopedic message from afar.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>More sophisticated space exploration. New knowledge and
techniques.
Fresh image of humanity's place in the universe.<br>
<b><b>Potential <b>Goal: </b></b></b>Initiate a major global project to achieve dialog with a
highly
intelligent extraterrestrial probe (perhaps the size of a loaf of bread), through establishing a
"welcome
committee" and security safeguards.<br>
<b>References and Notes:</b>                   <p>
                                  
45. <b>Summary:</b> Extraterrestrial Life Confirmed.  <br>
<b>Development: </b>Previously secret Post W.W.II projects come to light that confirm that
humans
have been interacting with life from elsewhere for some time. Japanese unveil new museum with
parts
from crashed vehicles. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Could be negative, could be positive, could be both.  In any
case,
massive global shifts in attitudes. Depends upon whether there is any "official" contact that comes
out
into the open and what the "message" is that is  communicated from the aliens.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>Become open-minded and knowledgeable enough to be able to make a
contribution to the

7. <b>Development: </b>Recognition that there is far more to learn in physics and other
disciplines,
that the frontiers of knowledge are unbounded.<br>
<b>Description: </b>Fundamental physics is not nearly so "closed" or "already understood" as
most
people imagine. Though it may take a long time, there are possibilities for truly massive shifts in
technology, based on figuring things out that we do not yet know at a very basic level.<br>
<b>Details: </b>Those who think things are known should read back about the turn of the last
century,
when there was MORE reason than there is today to think that "everything really important to
technology
has already been discovered." There are far more fundamental loose ends in  physics today than
there
were then... ranging from missing neutrinos, to the "age of the universe" (which casts doubt into a
lot
more things than just age), to fundamental mathematical inconsistencies, to nuclear theories we
can't
compute with and cannot therefore apply in detail, and so on. Consider how much technology has
been
changed by physics we had no clue of at the turn of the century... not only nuclear technology, but
quantum technology, which underlies modern electronics and optics....And then multiply it by the
greater
size of our basic ignorance today,  and it gives a clue to the potential for further changes. Though
I have
some more specific speculations, it is probably inappropriate to be specific at this time.<br>
<b>Strategies: </b>There are many, many challenges in stimulating a growth in basic
understanding.
Perhaps the most difficult is simply to restore or sustain the kind of culture which makes basic
discovery
possible. Individual theoretical science, and complex many-body experiments, will still be critical
to what
happens. A culture of over specialization and conformity needs to be broken down, to permit
more 
cross-fertilization and new ideas. But people who are constantly afraid of not finding jobs or
losing the
ones they have -- because of new funding and cultural realities -- may find it hard to give their
minds free
rein to the extent required for theoretical breakthroughs. And, of course, more encouragement of
gifted
children at early ages, would help in this and many other areas. Again, while I have a few more
specific
ideas, it would be inappropriate to focus on them at this time; there is a large set out there.<br>

26. <b>Development: </b>By far the most important thing on the technological horizon is
so-called
'cold fusion' (which is probably neither). There can now be no further doubt that we are tapping
new
energy sources by several different routes.<br>

43. <b>Development: </b>Zero-point energy/cold fusion breakthrough; beginning of end of fossil
fuels.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Energy revolution which effects every aspect of life. Potentially
eliminates most of global air pollution problems.  Allows large undeveloped countries (China) to
move 
ahead economically without adding to the pollution.  Changes the geopolitics of middle east. 
Philosophical shift: potentially decentralized way of producing power; no longer dependent upon
central
provider. <br>
<b>Goals: </b>Manage the integration of the new technology as quickly as possible while not
upsetting
the total world social systems.<br>

<b>Development: </b>Experimental results confirm mathematical theory that space-time can be
"engineered" to allow movement of object from one place to another instantaneously.<br>

Rethinking much of physics and ultimately technology. Confirmation of the possibility of

51. <b>Development: </b>Decreasing human skills development in concept formulation and
communication in an increasingly complex world.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> The gamut of human activity from perception of self to
personal
interaction to perception of the surrounding milieu has become increasingly technical and
complex. 
Despite this nominal advancement of humankind's knowledge base and capability, there are
decided
indications that such "advancement" is poorly distributed.  Many do not understand or trust
science; and,
many are incapable of communicating with others on a meaningful and workable level.  The
resultant
conflicts at all levels of interaction are readily apparent.<br>
<b>Goals: </b> Establish an understanding that individuals must learn how to learn, before being
able to
learn anything more technically  or socially complex.  There exists a plethora of information; but,
the
question remains of how can humankind best incorporate such information into knowledge?<br>

56. <b>Summary:</b> Need for scientific and philosphical thinking to explore the ethical
foundation of
advanced sciences and the scientific foundation of contemporary ethic.<br>
<b>Development: </b>There is not enough scientific and philosophical thinking that explores the
ethical
foundation of advanced sciences and the scientific foundation of contemporary ethic. This theme
should
be one of the permanent component of  the new intellectual paradigm coming out of the scientific
and
technological revolution of our time.
     Integration of biology and technology for improved bionics enhancing human capacity pose
dramatically the relations between science and ethic. A new ethic has been mentioned with regard
to
human responsibility on environmental problems.<br>

5. <b>Summary: </b>Airplanes that can reach orbit at much lower costs than current
methods.<br>
<b>Development: </b>Substantial progress has been made, in a quiet way, towards being able to
build
airplanes that reach earth orbit AS AIRPLANES, at airplane-like costs. The resulting reduction in
transportation costs could be the difference between an "Antarctica" kind of frontier (i.e. space as
an
expensive sideshow that never takes off) versus a "transcontinental railroad" kind of frontier
(something
that starts with subsidies but ends up growing and profitable and huge).<br>
<b>Details: </b>Really cost-effective growth in a space economy requires reduction in costs far
beyond
what is expected even with the important but limited improvements now planned for
single-stage-to-orbit
rockets. Such larger reductions should be possible using Mach 26 airplanes, in effect -- but the
idea here
has traditionally been seen (correctly) as very risky. However, there has been a lot of quiet work
filling in
a lot of the key show-stoppers. For example, one of the really critical problems is to maintain
control of
propulsion systems at high speeds; new control algorithms have been developed in the neural
network
field which appear to be able to solve such problems, in principle. Preliminary tests look good.
The major
hypersonic efforts being explored at NASA now include use of neural network control. NASA,
NSF
(with myself as technical contact) and the Air Force are now acting as partners, joint funding the
LoFlyte
project, which (with its expected extensions) continues US work in this field. In addition, some
innovative concepts for using magneto-hydrodynamic effects and various other technologies show
promise in solving some other problems which have existed in the past. There is a lot more to do,
but it
appears more likely than not that success can be had in this area, if we do things right.<br>
<b>Strategies:</b> It would help to have a new interagency effort in this field, and to bring in
new
players. The biggest challenges are to restore funding, and to build bridges to the very best states
of the
art in different disciplines (as opposed to heritage technology), not only in the US but also in
Russia,
Japan and maybe elsewhere.<br>

100. <b>Summary: </b>Power Relay Satellites in geosynchronous orbit, Solar Power Satellites in
Earth
orbits, and Lunar Power Satellites on the lunar surface.<br>
<b>Development: </b> Space Power System options (Power Relay Satellites, or PRS, in
geosynchronous orbit;  Solar Power Satellites, or SPS, in Earth orbits; and Lunar Power
Satellites, or
LPS, on the lunar surface)  can make  major contributions to achieving global sustainable
development
compatible with Earth's ecology.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Wireless power transmission (WPT), with PRS across
intercontinental
distances, of power generated by terrestrial renewable resources in selected locations and relayed
to
receivers on Earth, is achievable in 20 years.  Conversion of solar energy in orbit and directed
with WPT
to receivers on Earth is achievable in 30 years.  Conversion of solar energy on the lunar surface
and
directed with WPT to receivers on Earth is achievable in 50 years. These space power systems
would
ensure the availability of unfailing, globally-distributed energy for future generations to avoid the
deleterious effects of fossil fuels or nuclear power on the ecology.  <br>
<b>Goals: </b> Space Power Systems based on 100 years of WPT development, have evolved
over a
period of 25 years.  Associated technical, economic and societal issues were, and continue to be,
assessed, and key technologies demonstrated by universities, industry and government agencies in
America, Asia and Europe.  These systems can be developed and can be capable of meeting future
global
energy demands required to achieve the desired higher living standard of the global population,
based on
current engineering knowledge and accomplishments, and considerations of economic viability
and
societal acceptability.  Space Power Systems will ensure that the benefits of relying on solar
energy will
sustain all forms of life on Earth and will be available to all.<br>

<b>Additional Comments:</b>  Rationale for  Space Power Systems; Space Power Systems
should be
an integral part of the global industrialization goals to meet the insistent demands for higher living
standards of the exponentially growing population, which is estimated to reach 10 billion by
mid-21st
century. An acceptable approach to decreasing  this rate of population growth over time is to
raise the
living standard of the people. To achieve this goal increased energy supplies compatible with the
Earth's
ecology will be required on a global scale. One half of the global population will live in cities by
2000. 
The current migration into cities of 150,000 people per day will increase to 250,000 per day in 25
years. 
     There will be an unprecedented shift in economic strength during this time period, with several
emerging economies growing at least twice as fast as those of nations with mature economies. 
The
impact of these shifts will result in greatly increased consumption of available fuels.  This is
projected to escalate the degradation of the Earth's ecology to meet the energy demands of the
population
in the next century. In addition, the finite terrestrial energy resources have already, or will in the
foreseeable future, pass their peak availability. 
     Alternative energy development paths will become dominant in the post-2000 period, because
of
the growing uncertainties and extended lead times of fossil fuel power plants, refineries, and
associated
energy resource investments.  Over the next three decades capital requirements in the energy
sector are estimated to range between 13 to 20 trillion ($1990) to keep pace with the projected
doubling
of global  energy use.  The latter amount equals the total global economic output in 1990.
     There are vast fossil fuel energy resources on Earth but some are deep in the ocean or so far
underground that they are not yet and may never be economical to recover. Others like shale oil
are
environmentally unacceptable because they would require strip mining and huge amounts of
water. 
Development of oil and gas reserves is increasing at a slower rate when compared with increasing
consumption at a time when more people and countries compete for limited and declining
resources. The
deleterious consequences on the ecology of continued increases in the use of fossil fuels are not as
yet
fully determined, but indications are that placing ever-increasing reliance on these fuels is not
advisable.
     The promise of nuclear power has dimmed because long-term waste storage and safety issues
have yet to be resolved.  The potential of fusion power has not reached the stage of scientific
development to permit the solving of potential engineering challenges, to arrive at credible cost
scenarios,
and to project when it could begin to contribute.
While parts of the solution to meet global energy needs may already exist, current energy sources
are 
unlikely to meet the projected expansion of energy uses on a scale to ensure equitable access to
energy
supplies.  Now is the time to select and develop Space Power Systems that can access renewable
energy
sources on Earth and solar energy in space to sustain all forms of life on Earth.<p>

<b>Development:</b> Difference between one's dreams and expectations in his/her personal
futures and
fears coming from the expectations of dystopic global futures (environmental disasters, wars,
population
growth, etc.) - conflict in making one's dreams come true. The expectations dealing with one's
personal futures arise from a modern conception of the world and the expectations dealing with
the global
futures arise from the postmodern conception and transition from industrial to late-industrial and

97.<b> Summary: </b>The economic value of information is becoming more important than
information
sought for other purposes. <br>
<b>Development:</b> Effectiveness as the criterion for knowledge  In the present society,
information
is produced for sale and knowledge has become a commodity which is available in the terms
regulated by
market economy system.  The user of information is more and more often a buyer and consumer
of 
information (and knowledge), and information is a factor in the production of which the most
important
criterion has been the maximizing of as great a profit on the capital as possible.  The responsibility
of
using this information is not left at the producer but laid on the shoulders of the consumer. 
Lyotard says
that the traditional way of giving grounds to knowledge and science by themselves (by the
importance of
knowledge and science per se) is changing to a form of giving grounds on the basis of capacity
and
effectively.  When the fundamental question of a scientist or other person seeking for information
is no
more "is this true?" but "how this information could be made used of", practice has become the
guiding
force to knowledge. Von Wright speaks of practical sense which is taking over from practical
wisdom. 
Knowledge is worth knowing only in the parts which can be exploited economically.   <br>

98. <b>Summary:</b> The growth and change of the meaning of expertise.<br>
<b>Development:</b> Firstly, the tendency to lean on experts and leave the future to them to
make
decisions and tell the rest of us what to do and to expect from it.  Secondly, one can become an
expert on
very shallow proof.  One writing or appearance in public media will make an expert. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Knowledge per se becomes superficial. Thirdly, on the other
hand,
one's expertise is extended beyond the original subject area: an expert in one subject is asked for
advice
and opinions in any other possible subject.<br>

<center><font size=+1><i><b>The Pursuit of Meaning</b></i><p></font></center>

17.<b> Development: </b>The eager pursuit of greater meaning and purpose from work and from
life
(among many groups of people, not just those with plenty of food and possessions.)<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Increased emphasis on the deeper meaning and purpose of work
and
organizations to community and society. Secular religions spring up.<br>
<b>Potential Goal:</b> Initiate several major projects in the social sciences to understand the
desire for
and source of meaning and purpose in various parts of the world.<br>

99.<b> Summary: </b>The growing feeling of guilt: we know more and more about all the
human-made
problems, environmental and other, and feel less and less comfortable with our everyday life and
practice.
<br>
<b>Development:</b> Ask a 7-year old about nature and he/she starts to tell you about
the environmental global problems instead of telling about birds and bees.  Instead of more
responsible
behavior, this can lead to total indifference and destructive behaviors in one's personal life: the
problems
are so big that there is nothing one can do, so let's just enjoy it as long as we can.<br>

<center><font size=+1><i><b>Social Change</b></i><p></font></center>

64.<b> Summary: </b>Memes (postulated as the smallest unit of social evolution) becoming a
new
method for planning and directing the evolution of technology and society.<br>
<b>Development:</b> The emergence of memetic engineering as a proactive planning and design
strategy.  Memes, recently postulated as the smallest unit of social evolution will become a
powerful new
method for taking charge of the evolution of technology and society, rather than the present
condition of
adaptation to constant and seemingly random change in the environment.     This development will
introduce many new metaphors and tools for organization, management and development.  These
new
tools and metaphors incorporate strategies and dynamics drawn from self organization, chaos
theory,
Chinese medicine, Taoist philosophy, cellular automata, etc.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Positive: A new renaissance of self organizing creativity and
invention, with self awareness and solidarity pulling cultures together to steward the planet into a
new
era.  An evolutionary convergence.  Negative: A new era of market based designer culture, and
cults.  A
diversity of idiosyncratic and isolated pockets of change, an evolutionary divergence.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Develop the ability for early detection of new memes and the ability to test,
project and
or simulate the effects of these memes on target populations. Develop the capacity to "invent"
new
memes.  The process of invention will probably be closely related to predicting the negative or
positive
impacts of the new meme. Memes could be developed from an exisiting market/political/social
paradigm
or  memes could be developed through a visioning process such as scenario building or shamanic
journeying.<br>
<b>Domain:</b> 6<br>
<b>References and Notes:</b> Japan has already taken steps in this direction with their white
paper
approach to technology impact and design.  It has even been tentatively labeled as "Heartware". 
Heartware is an attempt to reverse the process of endlessly having to adapt to new technology.  In
heartware engineering one first visions a preferred future state and then uses this as design criteria
for
consciously evolving technology. Scenario building could be seen as a precursor to memetic
engineering.
Scenarios as currently used offer insight and options to dealing with the future, only on rare
occaisions
are they used in memetic fashion as a proactive tool to consciously engineer the future.<br>

<i>Morphogenetic Joint Ventures,</i>  Dawkins, on Memes.  Unfortunately time and memory

assemble a more comprehensive bibliography.           <p>
                                  
82.<b> Development: </b>Participatory round tables that include the ability to weigh interest and
quality of contributions in given time frames and creating a new form of structuring meetings and
conferences.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Valuing contributions and increasing to talk in a way others
want to
listen to. Will reduce the input of high esteem but no content monologues of invited speakers and
will
help to structure content and meaning. Results were surprise as dialogue lives from timeliness and
exchange which can not be planned. The anticipated result is giving Voice to no-name
participants, and
allow the design of CSCW to have on-line contributions of non physical non-local meetings.
Another
result is the appreciation as time and quality in one currency and a deeper appreciation of
time-sharing
instead time-stealing and ego-exposition.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> To keep people interested and provide a feeling of having value and voice that
matters.<br>

95.<b> Summary: </b>The blurring of the borderline between truth and fiction; the certainty of
reality
is disappearing from our conception of the world.<br>
<b>Development:</b> According to Baudrillard, reality is disappearing from our conception of
the
world, because the difference between real and imaginary (illusory) has lost its functionality,
ability to
function - it is no more practical nor useful.  This can be understood so that the purpose of tales,
stories, fantasies has always been to help the human to understand his/her reality and his/her own
place in
this reality.  Now, however, reality itself has become so complex that the old, directly into story
form
translated models of explanation have often lost their ability to explain anything anymore. The
new,
strange world needs new and much more complicated stories to explain it.  It takes much more
words,
symbols, images to take over the present than before.  It is easy to try to simplify that which is
too complicated, with the help of fiction to draw anew the curves of reality, too difficult to
understand
instead of trying to explain them.<br>

96.<b> Summary: </b>The blurring of the borderline between private and public. <br>
<b>Development:</b> When the importance of knowledge is growing in the society, the forms of
public
communication are diversifying and the instrumental contacting surfaces of human interaction are
widening.  It has been said often in public that the larger social areas the societal research reaches,
the
less private the life of an individual will be.  As a matter of fact this has become some kind of a
political
slogan, a tool with which certain political interest groups have criticized the size of the sector of
social policy in the society.  On the other hand, reasons for the blurring of the private and the
public
sectors can be found in politics and power conventions of the public sector.<br>
     In the change of the society, growing complexity makes it still more difficult  to perceive and
to
take over the reality.  The image from the world keeps on changing along the new material and
information which comes from the four corners of the globe through the media.  The more a
human  faces
difficulties in defining his/her situation, the more helpless and estranged or even alienated he/she
becomes,
and the more estranged the individual feels him-/herself, the less he/she trusts in the information
coming
in, and at the same time, essential and unessential lose their meaning and get also blurred.  As an
example,
during the Finnish presidential elections the contents of the candidates waste baskets were given
the same
meaning in the media as their political, social and economic points.  <br>

117.<b> Development: </b>Changing role of women in society<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Perhaps changes in terms of values in society, different ways to
manage and lead; other ways to care for children, the elderly and the sick. This will also imply
changing
roles of men in society.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> To bring up equity in gender roles for the collective benefit.<br>

44.<b> Summary: </b>Wild Card: Return of the Messiah, Sri Satha Sai Baba <br>
<b>Development:</b> Sri Satha Sai Baba proves himself to be reincarnation of the Christ. Indian
holy
man who regularly does "miracles" including raising people from dead, does, in fact, as he has
promised,
convince world that he is this age's avatar.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> More people than the present millions flock to his small town in

80.<b> Summary: </b>Use of space and visual access as a new way to approach synthetic realms,
making use of Virtual Reality (computer generated sense of reality) and Cyberspace in
design.<br>
<b>Development:</b> Use of space and the assimilation potential of visual access as an
orientation
realm or meaning and understanding and a new way to approach syntetic realms, making use of
VR and
Cyberspaces by providing orientation and easing understanding.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Change in world views, mental models and ways of
presentation, and
the reassurance of imagination and Eidetics.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Ease communication and participatory exchange over issues of common
relevance.
Widen views, counteract the hardening of categories, give room for transdisciplinary,
metaphorical and
figurative explanation and curricula.<br>

<font size=+2>ROUND 2 QUESTIONNAIRE<p><b>SECTION 2</b></font><p>
<font size=+1>FULL-TEXT OF DEVELOPMENTS</font></center><p>
<br>
The second round of the 1996 Global Look-Out questionnaire comes in two sections.  You
should already have Section 1. Section 2 includes the full text of developments in only one of the
six Millennium Project domains.  Selection of the domain sent to you was based on your first
round responses, resume, publications, previous expressions of interest and or our best judgment. 
If you want to comment and add to the full text of developments in other domains, please
download them from the Millennium Project's home page:
<i>http//nko.mhpcc.edu/millennium/Millennium_Project.html</i> or request them from the
Project's coordinating office.<p>

In this second section, you are asked for comments, improvements, or additions to the material
submitted by yourself and others in the first round.  You do not have to comment on every
development in this domain, just those developments that are important to you and to which
you can contribute new consquences, strategies, and references. <p>

You can respond in several ways:<p>

1. If you received the material via email or downloaded it from the homepage, you can simply
insert you YOUR COMMENTS IN CAPITAL LETTERS or in
>some other way to identify your additions into the text and submit the whole domain back via
email >to<i> jglenn@igc.org.</i><p>

2.  You need not include the full text in your response.  You can simply write the reference
number for the development followed by your additions and email, fax, or mail it back.<p>

<center><font size=+2><i><b>Domain 1: Demographics and Human
Resources</b></i><br></font></center>
<hr><p>

<center><font size=+1><i><b>Population</b></i><p></font></center>

24. <b>Summary: </b>High population growth among poor nations and people.<br>
<b>Development: </b>the prospects of population growth that will continue to tax available
resources of the earth and of various societies; the prospect of huge population growth among
peoples and subgroups that have the least means to support such growth (i.e., poor, uneducated
families, for whom many children means children committed to lives of poverty, misery, lack of
opportunity and education), <br>
 <b>Potential Consequences: </b>Instability and violence, increased class, communal violence,
the growth of the number of people living in poverty. <br>
<b>Goals: </b><br>
<b>References and Notes: </b>Robert F. Chandler, Jr. former president, Univ. of New
Hampshire, former. director, International Rice Research Institute, Philippines, an architect in the
rice revolution in Asia, winner of the World Food Prize (the ceremony for which took place at the
Smithsonian), is an authority in the area of population growth (as a negative phenomenon)<p>

25.  <b>Summary: </b> The growth of use and effectiveness of social marketing.<br>
<b>Development: </b>Family planning offers one type of solution; social marketing (the kind that
Eduerdo Roberto practices -- see attachment) offers another. Raising levels of education and
aspiration, as a antidote to unthinking birthing and family growth.<br>
<b>References and Notes: </b>
<p>

31. <b>Development: </b>Development of a means of extending life span, possibly through
genetic techniques.<br>
<b>References and Notes: </b>                    
<p>
                     
59. <b>Development: </b> Life extension technologies, primarily bio-drugs (including melatonin,
HGH, DHEA and other hormones), will extend lifespans, enhance health, and increase human
activity during those extended years. Maximum life span could be extended by 25% perhaps even
by 60%. Other medical advances, such as replacement (cloned or grown) organs for implantation,
neural implants (of nerve tissues & electronics), will also increase longevity (for wealthier
individuals). Improved lifestyles and living conditions will allow average human life spans to be
extended and to approach maximum life span.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Longer lifespans - up to 150 years for 1 million people by 2100.
Smaller numbers of people may live beyond 160 (after 2100 AD). Around 50 million centenarians
by 2025 and at least 500 million  centenarians by 2100.  Life expectancy at birth in advanced
countries to approach 120 years by 2100.<br>
     Increased world population caused by lowered death rate. Probably million extra
by 2025 and over 1 billion extra by 2100). Average age of population will rise to almost 60 by
year 2100.  As large numbers of people approach the maximum achievable life span, the death
rate of the oldest old may climb (by the year 2100) leading to stabilization and perhaps some small
shrinkage in total world population. <br>
     Increased activities by older people, in all aspects of life but especially in sports,
tourism,
continued business activities and careers, and reduced retirement.  Bored & poorer old who are
still  physically active may produce phenomenon of delinquent elders. Tomorrow's aged will
require more resources and food than today's aged, but will require lower health care levels,
although over a much longer period. <br>
     Inheritance of wealth will become much rarer as parents require and spend much
of their
wealth. Governments dependent on inheritance taxes may seek alternatives and start to tax other
sources such as life extension drugs, and/or treatments.<br>
     Many new business opportunities will arise catering to the new old, especially in
health,
beauty, sport and travel. The relatively vulnerable older population may be susceptible to virulent
outbreaks of infections such as colds.  Sudden decreases in world population may occur, possibly
causing economic problems and instability.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>Establish an unbiased investigation into the realities of life extension drugs and
treatments.  Continue to review the scientific journals for new drugs and therapies for life
extension and produce independent recommendations for their use. [Sorry, this is a duplication of
the efforts being made by the Life Extension Foundation, albeit without their hype and sales
pitch].  Encourage research projects into aging, to understand and make it more viable, and to
enhance prospects for  life extension.  Investigate the likely impacts of the life extension drugs and
treatments, on individuals, their lives, and on World population and its structure.  Integrate these
results with studies of World populations and economics to determine the viability of life
extension (at individual and global levels), and identify strategies to improve that viability.<br>
     Over the medium term, establish (national) departments to review  the
circumstances and
projected circumstances of the new aged.  In addition to humanitarian needs such as pensions and
aged  health matters, these departments should be involved with social integration of older
populations, with retirement age decisions and ways of improving creativity and productivity
throughout active life, as well as with the viability of longer lives-- the economics and
sustainability of longer-lived and older communities.  The departments should have international
links as well as local influence, so as to assist the implementation of programs which may be
politically difficult in the local arena. Although some countries may already have such
departments, (e.g. the U.S. National Institute on Aging), their programs may not be as extensive
(age-wise or in detail), nor as globally integrated as is proposed here.<br>      Establish an
(international?) science review & implementation council, with funding, to encourage basic
scientific research projects, (at national and international levels), and capable of identifying,
promoting and implementing possible technologies and/or strategies  which will enable
productivity or efficiency gains, which create wealth, and which enable people to finance and
enjoy their longer lives.<br>
     Some strategies may involve co-operation or subsidy of commercial
organizations, but the
objective would be to improve material abundance [a good foundation for improved quality of
life, which should reduce stress and crime, and is essential for longevity which otherwise might
become a misery.  Given the basics of life (in abundance), it becomes easier for humans to aspire
to higher creativity & integrity]. assist with ecologically sound advancement of human activities
such as low impact and self-sustaining industries/fisheries/etc. [Damage and loss of resources and
(especially) of our fellow species on this planet, makes life so much poorer; and without
ecological studies and knowledge, all (any) life forms, including human, can easily & unwittingly
be endangered]. <br>
     Promote and make education more freely and easily obtainable, including greater
emphasis on
life preparation, life-values, productivity during life, peace and co-operation, and science
appreciation.  Encourage United Nations to produce and distribute videos and TV programs.<br>
     Discourage all aspects of ageism.  This may include subtle advertising and
legislation where
necessary.  Create business and employment possibilities for older people, including part-time jobs
and job-sharing.  Allow tax concessions for workers who delay retirement and pensions. 
Encourage governments to adopt suitable policies and legislation, and to encourage social
structures which allow older people to remain productive.  These objectives might fall under the
jurisdiction of organizations described above.<br>
     Encourage wider public awareness of longevity and its possibilities including the
decline option
('not for me thank-you'). Self-preparation by individuals for the future (especially with financial
and career plans) is the easiest and most direct way to make later years happier and more
successful.<br>
     Identify the extent and likely impact of life extension, so that appropriate and
timely actions
can be adopted. These might include: A) Inclusion on census questionnaires of appropriate
questions to identify the usage of life extension technologies; B) Analysis of census data to
estimate longevity, and population levels into the future (From ancestor longevity data).  C)
Evaluate economic viability of longevity, and capability of individuals and governments to adapt
to and sustain those economic circumstances.<br>
     Get funding for the preparation and development of the future.<br>
     Past mistakes have often been due to lack of foresight & planning. Most of us will
be around
to appreciate the future, so it's very worthwhile to plan now and to get it right for the future. 
(This would probably be at relatively low cost).  Let's make it our new challenge, now that other
challenges such as the cold war have dissipated.  Without a challenge, we may just stumble along.
Our challenge should be preparation and development of the future, to maximize opportunities,
and minimize the pitfalls. Continuous and moderate economic growth is a keystone to that better
future.<br>
     Economic growth can be achieved through infrastructure and 'sustainable
development' of this
planet.  Greater education and specialization of the human population will follow, allowing more
people to become involved and to contribute (through jobs and interests), to the growth of the
world.  It's important to stimulate and increase the wider diversity of human interests and
activities (much of which IS already occurring).  This expansion of activity and diversity leads to
the creation of many new opportunities and leads to more jobs and greater prosperity.  Longevity
and older populations are also more likely to thrive in such circumstances.  This policy of growth
and diversity should help to avoid economic recessions, unemployment, and their attendant human
distress. The defining limit to human activity is energy in the form of food and fuel. <br>
     Although currently somewhat strained and projected to continue that way, energy
supplies can
be supplemented with solar energy, in its various guises, which is freely available and in vast
quantities.  Getting the designs right and the costs down are the challenge, and this challenge is
being met and won. Wind generated electricity is now priced at similar levels to electricity from
coal powered generators.  Photo-voltaics are approaching similar viability.  These two
achievements (examples of many) have been made possible by foresighted funding and planning. 
Science, including basic research, has much to offer the advancement of our human civilizations. 
And the limits and possibilities for harnessing its potential are almost boundless. But none of it is
possible without the funding. Will you decline the challenge?   GET FUNDED !<br>

human vitality.<br>
<b>Development: </b> Growing realization of the fundamental importance of the human resource
factor -- both in quantity and
quality -- in sustaining economic growth and thus the unfeasibility to attain it at the same time
with a global "zero population
growth" policy.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Humanity will face the need to decide whether human society
will remain limited to existing
on this planet, thus choking expansion and growth, freezing the social status quo and becoming
used to vastly more oppressive
conditions, or allowing for planned population growth, economic expansion and technological
progress in a greatly expanded
environment, including first the solar system and later on the galaxy and the whole universe. This
will bring a reevaluation of
mega and giga technological projects, including planetary exploration and colonization,
terraforming, solar system engineering,
construction of Dyson's rings and spheres, etc., thus opening a vast new frontier for the human
species.  New social and political
structures will have to be built to coordinate such giga efforts.  A long term horizon will have to
be included in decision-making
processes.<br>
Potential Goal:  Expand the temporal and spatial planning horizon. Promote long-term
prospectives studies.  Allow for creative
and adventuresome individuals willing to assume rational risks.    <br>

58. <b>Summary: </b>Some governments abdicating their responsibilties in public health as a
result of budget
contractions.<br>
<b>Development: </b>Most governments in countries at all levels of development are
experiencing budget contraction in the
social services, particularly health.  In developing and newly independent states major
development and funding agencies are
encouraging downsizing and privatization in health services that were formally provided by the
government at one level or
another.  While this may be necessary, its needs to be better managed.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Without great care in choosing what is to be reduced or
eliminated from government health
services, very important disease prevention and control functions can be lost.  The negative health
results are often immediate,
e.g. diphtheria deaths in NIS countries.  Governments are basically abdicating their responsibilities
in public health,
responsibilities only they can fulfill.<br>
<b>Goal/Strategy:</b> One idea that is being floated here in WHO is to create a list of "essential
public health functions", now
and those that are expected to be essential in the year 2020, which all countries should ensure are
properly carried out by
government, NGO or community sources.  WHO and other international agencies can assist in
devising assessment criteria and
methods and in strengthening common weak areas, such as disease surveillance, using new
communication technologies.<br>

cities in sub-Sahara Africa.
(WHO comments: The 25% level is true in the 5-10 major cities in sub-Sahara Africa).<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Drastic reduction in the number of bright young people who
would ordinarily take over
leadership positions; some forms of re-colonialism; fleeing tourism; acceleration of brain drain;
collapsing population growth.
"By the year 2010, demographers estimate that AIDS will have lowered life expectancy from 66

National Academy of Sciences
(USA) report.<br>
<b>Potential Goal:</b> Once immunization and or treatment of AIDS is discovered, production
of a television and radio
program on a new morality that also gives immunization and or treatment delivery information
that is so entertaining that at least
50% of Sub-Saharan Africans listen to it daily.<br>

<b>Comment from Round 1 (Godoy): </b>Development: The presence of HIV in 25% of adult
population in practically all
cities of sub-Sahara Africa should not be approached as one of the "African problems". HIV is by
all means a "Global problem"
worth of "Global concern" and "Global responsibility" and, therefore, must be treated "locally"
but with "Global resources" -
scientific, institutional and financial resources - and not only in Africa, but in all places where HIV
is present..

39. <b>Development: </b>Increased food scarcity owing to population growth and a general
inability to increase production to
keep up with that growth.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>In the developed countries of the world, higher food prices will
lead to inflationary pressures
which dampen economic growth and contribute to increased inequality and political discontent. In
the developing countries,
these same forces will be at work, but to a greater degree, especially in countries which rely
heavily on food imports.
Economically insecure segments of the population may strike to demand higher wages, and/or
pressure their governments to
subsidize food prices. Some governments may forcibly repress such discontent, abandoning
democratic practices, and/or turn
outward and refuse to fulfill their debt obligations to developed countries, thereby further
endangering global economic growth
and political cooperation. In the underdeveloped countries, food will be too expensive or scarce
for a significant number, leading
to increased malnutrition, economic misery, and the unchecked spread of disease. In some of
these countries, the threat of
starvation and political discontent will lead to anarchy and/or civil war, causing economic and
political systems to collapse. Mass
migrations into neighboring countries will lead to tension and hostilities between those states able
to keep their military
institutions intact.  After a prolonged period (perhaps decades),  food scarcity will abate given
that starvation, plague, war, and
violent crime will reduce human numbers and the demand for world food production.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>Coordinated global efforts and financial  incentives directed towards
contraception and sterilization to reduce
population growth. Forgive debt owed by poorer nations under conditions that savings will be
used to improve the productive
capacity of their farmers. Educational campaigns and heavy taxes on meat to encourage
consumers in wealthier countries to
adopt diets which to rely on the direct consumption of grain rather than grain-consuming
livestock. Increased investments in
biotechnology to create higher yielding crop varieties.<br>

40. <b>Summary: </b>Increased scarcity of fresh water, possibly exacerbated by global
warming.<br>
<b>Development: </b>Increased scarcity of fresh water in localized areas around the world. 
Also, while the severity and exact
effects of global warming remain unknown, any change in rainfall patterns will undermine the
effectiveness of existing water
control, storage and distribution facilities and widen the areas affected by scarcity.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Decreased availability of water is a contributing factor in
limiting global food production.
Competition between urban users and irrigators will typically lead to the retirement of farmland.
In regions where water is
particularly short, and people are relatively poor, increased reliance on polluted or sewage-tainted
waters will increase the
likelihood of disease.  International tensions will arise between nations sharing river basins and
groundwater sources, leading to
possible military action to secure the scarce resource. Those countries or regions currently facing
scarcity include: eleven
African countries, including those sharing the Nile River; nine Middle Eastern countries, including
the politically volatile region
of Israel, Jordan, Syria, and the Palestinian West Bank; northern China, including the country's
capital, Beijing, and the
agricultural lands surrounding it; India, including the country's capital, New Delhi and tens of
thousands of rural villages
dependent on irrigated farming; Mexico, including its capital, Mexico City, and the large,
productive irrigated farmlands in the
country's arid northern portion; and finally, some cities and irrigated farmlands of the western
United States. <br>
<b>Goals: </b>Encourage conservation through the diffusion of techniques and technologies
which improve the efficient use
and management of fresh water resources. Develop water trading and marketing practices which
allow users and managers to
better allocate scarce supplies as well as fund conservation and infrastructure improvements.
Secure treaties and cooperative
agreements between nations sharing water sources before increased scarcity pushes them<br>
into political confrontation.<br>

61. <b>Development: </b>Increasing need to improve water resources, for larger populations,
and to alleviate demand and
pollution pressures on existing waterways.  <br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>In the future, it seems highly likely that demand for water will
increase and that the price of
water will need to rise to encourage economy in water use, and to cover higher production
costs.<br>
<b>Goals/Strategy:</b> Establish a World Water Agency to develop and expedite new water
technology and water
extraction/collection projects.  It also might arbitrate in disputes over water, and be able to
suggest alternative solutions.  By
establishing a 'United Nations' of water, consensus could be established to accept quotas of higher
priced man-made water, and
to equalize water prices, preparing the way for man-made water production projects such as
OTEC ships. World Water Agency
could assist the research and deployment of water conservation technologies, and techniques
which allow better utilization of
water resources, especially in agriculture. Man-made water production methods (e.g. distillation
of seawater) are expensive.
New methods need to be found or cheaper ones such as OTEC (ocean thermal energy conversion)
need to be widely deployed. 
Because it requires cold water from the deep ocean, OTEC technology has not been widely
adopted due to ocean access and
delivery problems.  OTEC can also provide energy and marine food as well as fresh water, so if it
can be developed, it offers a
very environmentally friendly way to enhance World water supplies.  Design, funding and
operation of man-made water projects
(such as OTEC ships), requires greater resources than most corporations are capable, (and less
profitably than their other
activities).  World Water Agency could be the way to expedite inexpensive man-made water
production, probably using
OTEC.<br>

displacement of jobs, the skewing of job deployment according to hi-tech, medium-tech, lo-tech,
the skewing of jobs among

<b>Potential Consequences: </b>the lack of jobs (income, status) may be
particularly
detrimental in industrializing (third-world) societies, where universities are producing graduates
and graduates have little or no prospect of employment
commensurate to their training, status, and expectation potential for alienation and violence

84. <b>Summary: </b>Proliferation of information
technology displacing many low- skilled, well-paid workers in the
developed world; simultaneously, shortage of people with adequate skills.<br>
<b>Development: </b>Proliferation of information technology displaces many low-skilled,
relatively well-paid workers in the
developed world (secretaries just the beginning -- customer service reps, mortgage loan officers,
bank tellers, security guards,
administrative support personnel, etc.).  There are concurrent labor shortages in high technology
fields because organizations
cannot find people with adequate IT skills.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Deteriorating tax base as people unable to find new work at
comparable pay.  Social unrest
and upheaval (crime) with no economic means to fix.  Increasing distance between "haves" and
"have nots." Increasing efficiency
for firms (usually forces competitors to match the efforts of the firm with the competitive
advantage).  Opportunity for 
technologically literate societies.  There is job creation (in the orgs. that develop the IT and
software) but it requires significantly
higher skill than many of the jobs IT displaced. Downsizing may not displace all workers into
unemployment (many find other
jobs, usually at lower levels of pay), but it does cut into the overall ability, of a society to consume
goods and services.  Are
major corporations effectively eliminating each others customer base by laying them off?<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>Education, education, education.  Example:  To try and improve the
technological literacy of its
populace, Japan offers incentives (such as overnight electronic transfer of tax refunds to those
citizens who file their income tax

motivated to purchase home
PCs to do the same.  PC ownership in Japan goes from about 15% in 1995 to 45% 16 months
later.  Many of these owners are
between that ages of 30 and 50, exactly the citizens who needed to upgrade their IT skills the
most. <br>

66. <b>Summary: </b>Distance learning increasingly practical, through the Internet and World
Wide Web multimedia
capabilities.<br>
<b>Development: </b>Distance learning is possible and increasingly practical, thanks to the
growing reach of the Internet and
to the multimedia capabilities of the World Wide Web.  Simultaneously, distance learning is
increasingly needed because rapid
changes in technology, commerce, etc. have rendered the concept of a "completed" education
obsolete.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Billions of individuals around the world will have a continuing
need to update their skills or
learn new ones.  Compared to traditional classrooms/training centers, virtual classrooms are less
expensive to create, easier to
maintain, and more convenient.  If distance learning can become effective enough, it can help
solve major problems associated
with economic change and dislocation, as well as contributing to human enrichment. <br>
<b>Potential Goals: </b> Accelerate progress in developing the techniques and technologies to
make distance learning more
effective as a substitute for traditional approaches.  Ensure that the Internet, or whatever
supplants the Internet, evolves with the
capabilities that distance learning requires.  Governments, businesses, unions, educational
institutions, and the public can all
benefit from  fulfilling these goals.<br>

71. <b>Development: </b>'Learning Organization' concepts increasingly recognized as the most
innovative and useful new
management technique of the past decade.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>If we do not learn faster than the amount of change that is going
on there is little hope of progress.
Also the ability of an organization to learn faster than its competitors is considered as its only
sustainable competitive advantage.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>To put 'learning' at the top of the agenda for us all as individuals, as well as for
organizations (and societies) to
recognize that it is critical for their survival. (Perhaps there is scope for a major Millennium
Project on 'What can we learn from
history?')<br>

73. <b>Development: </b> Through satellite TV/Computer links, instant access to essentially
everyone, and to all the information
that is available in the world. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Unless there is an increasing  easily generate intellectual
exhaustion on the quality of this material.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>To ensure that 'quality' rather than 'quantity' focused management techniques are
developed to help us with the new
knowledge explosion. This leads to (and overlaps with) the need for a new learning revolution.
(Similar to the historic revolutions
that were driven by reading/writing and printing breakthroughs?) Acceptance of the concept of
mental pollution in the same way as
we are increasingly concerned about physical pollution. The media (as a product) needs to accept
responsibility for its (long term)
consequences in a similar way to manufacturers. The importance of increased research to monitor
critical areas and their consequence
needs to be emphasized.<br>

93. <b>Development: </b>Integration of human consciousness and technology: increasingly
technology is being put into and on
the human body; and intelligent technology is being put in the environment.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Merger of these two trends will make a continuum of
technology and consciousness on a species-wide and global basis. Globally, anyone in one
geographic point can access cyberscpace to affect or be affected by others at any other
locations geographically.  Locally, anyone can shake hands with another transmitting data through
each other's body to computers
located in their shoes.  Locally and globally, the majority of people and intelligent technology
become an integrated whole or a
"Conscious-Technology" civilization.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>Enlightenment of Conscious-Technology civilization by deliberately merging the
mystic's attitude toward the world
and the technocrats' management of the world. <br>

125. <b>Development: </b>As a result of entry of many countries into the post-industrial era,
growth of unemployment and free
time, and the division of the population into "able" and "unable."<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>The problem of the rate of unemployment and the spending of
free time, the division of the
population into "able" and "unable" to make themselves useful in intellectually demanding
employment, etc. in post industrial
countries. Many other countries will remain for a long time in the stage of industrial development
and some countries will continue
to be in the agricultural stage of development.<br>

<font size=+1>FULL-TEXT OF DEVELOPMENTS</font></center><p>
<br>
The second round of the 1996 Global Look-Out questionnaire comes in two sections.  You
should already have Section 1. Section 2 includes the full text of developments in only one of the
six Millennium Project domains.  Selection of the domain sent to you was based on your first
round responses, resume, publications, previous expressions of interest and or our best judgment. 
If you want to comment and add to the full text of developments in other domains, please
download them from the Millennium Project's home page:
<i>http//nko.mhpcc.edu/millennium/Millennium_Project.html</i> or request them from the
Project's coordinating office.<p>

In this second section, you are asked for comments, improvements, or additions to the material
submitted by yourself and others in the first round.  You do not have to comment on every
development in this domain, just those developments that are important to you and to which
you can contribute new consquences, strategies, and references. <p>

You can respond in several ways:<p>

1. If you received the material via email or downloaded it from the homepage, you can simply
insert you YOUR COMMENTS IN CAPITAL LETTERS or in
>some other way to identify your additions into the text and submit the whole domain back via
email >to<i> jglenn@igc.org.</i><p>

2.  You need not include the full text in your response.  You can simply write the reference
number for the development followed by your additions and email, fax, or mail it back.<p>

11. <b>Development:</b> The threat of weapons in outer space, as the proposed Star Wars gains
support among Republicans. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b>  Spreading lethal warfare into outer space, contaminating outer
space
and possibly preventing humanity from taking its natural next step in the development of
resources,
habitats and energy from space.  Losing vital time in establishing a non-terrestrial resource base in
space,
which may prove to be vital to humanity's long range future. <br>
     Development of a 30 years Earth-Space Human Development Long Range Program whose
goal
would be the establishment of an environmental niche for humanity in the solar system with
maximum
benefit to Earth life.  It should be designed as an organic step by step evolution from a closed to
an open
world scenario, as outlined by the late Rockwell Space scientist, Krafft  Ehricke in his
Extraterrestrial
Imperative.  This manuscript is still unpublished, as far as I know, but technical papers are
available. 
SYNCONs , the synergistic convergence process developed by The Committee for the Future,
should be
used to identify and strategize the positive effects of this long-range evolutionary goal on all
systems and
functions in the social body.  New governmental, corporate and public participation should be
invented to
provide maximum international cooperation, public participation and democratic choice in the
great
pioneering effort of the 21st century.   <br>

23. <b>Summary:</b> Religious, racial, ethnic, ideological wars such as in Rwanda and
Liberia.<br>
<b>Development:</b> the prospect of further increase and scope of collective and communal
violence,
resulting from religious, racial, ethnic, ideological wars; the prospect of collective violence
increasing as
we reach the new millennium (and the intensification of superstitions, mystical, millennial causes,
fringe
religions and cults, etc. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> (It would be a good idea to chart, with whatever data available,
the
slopes and frequencies of forms of collective violence, during the past 100 years: is there a
discernible
increase, in what forms, etc.?) The consequences of these forms of potential violence can be seen
in
Rwanda, Liberia, in Iran (with respect to what is done to its own people as well as what is done to
others), etc. <br>
<b>Goals:</b> More research projects uncovering the causes of collective violence (or
religiously-fanatical-driven violence), etc. <br>

33. <b>Development:</b> Cultural contrast developing in ethnic wars such as Rwanda and
Liberia.
Spread of cultural conflicts could be avoided by careful observation of cultural trends in a country
and
possibly prevent the spreading of conflicts. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b>  Continuous conflicts. Increase in migration at regional and
interregnal level thus provoking environmental, political and economic tensions. See migration
from
African Countries to South European Countries and within Africa.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Creation of interdisciplinary observatories to at least foresee the possible
development of
such conflicts and alert  decision makers. <br>

36. <b>Development:</b> Mexico's recurrent economic and political crises provoke national
disintegration posing severe and immediate challenges to the U.S. and the North American
Region,
including low intensity conlict.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b>  Low and medium intensity regional conflicts in Mexico
threaten to
spill over the border.  Serious disruption of most nationwide economic processes significantly
increase
poverty throughout the country and with it, the likelihood of riots, famine and widespread
epidemics. 
Worsening economic and political conditions force massive movements of Mexican population.
The flux
of immigrants to the U.S. grows rapidly and without control.  U.S. is gradually impacted by the
turmoil
of its southern neighbor.  First the border areas, then territories farther away.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b> To avoid such catastrophic development, economic growth and
political reform are two necessary goals.  The U.S. government should be ready to help Mexico
achieve
political reform by establishing a cautious but firm policy of 1) demanding respect for basic human
rights,
internationally supervised free elections and accountability of public officials;  2) Linking
economic and
financial aid to political reform;  3) Closely supervising Mexico's economic policies;  4) Being
agreeable
to: first a monetary union, and second: economic and political integration.<br>

77. <b>Summary:</b> Emergence of nationalism in Asia, e.g. Japan, (including the possibility of
a
Japanese military buildup), in response to the continued pressure from the US, China and Korea.
<br>
<b>Development:</b> Stability of regional relations is challenged. Japanese unconscious
readiness to
allow military buildup is becoming surface in the form of open demands for a constitutional
change and
recognition of its Self Defense Forces as an integral element of international contribution through
a series
of PKD participation. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Together with Chinese and Korean demands for compensation,
even
after 50 years since the end of the war, the US demands for Japanese burden sharing in regional
defense
and economic and trade concessions will invite Japan's resurgence as an independent military
power. This
will cause a serious power rivalry tension in Asia and derail its economic dynamism.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Establish both official and non official back channels of communication among the
major
nations in Asia and the US. Disseminate information about dangerous developments at an early
stage and
appeal to the common sense of decision makers and the public alike.<br>

manipulation or
falsification of  information by electronic means to achieve political ends.<br>

106. <b>Development:</b> The "patriot" movement gains strength in the US and causes legal,
police,
and military responses to assure public tranquillity in the nation.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Loss of some freedoms and preserving the legal rights of the
majority.<br>

115. <b>Development:</b> Deepening of ethnic sentiments in populations (homogenization of
economies and knowledge, but heterogeneity in terms of ethnic affiliation and stronger
determination of
ethnic boundaries).<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Wars, conflicts until ethnic communities feel conformable that
they
can keep their ethnic identity and boundaries in spite of globalization of economy and knowledge.
Land
division and countries' definition could also change and be redefined (as they once were) in terms
of
ethnic affiliation.  <br>
<b>Goals:</b> Promotion of respect and tolerance for ethnic diversity, adapt systems.<br>

118. <b>Development:</b> China turns militant.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Wars with India and Russia or against an alliance between these
two,
to war with Formosa, and in consequence with Japan and the US. China could also mix into wars
between the two Koreas and between India and Pakistan, should they occur.<br>

120. <b>Development:</b> US retreats from the position of "world policemen." <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> US opens to Europe and Transatlantic (partially also political)
union.
This seems to be an appropriate step to the US since Europe seems incapable of uniting further
and to
overcome its regional problems such as the Balkans or the legacy of the Soviet Union. Russia
turns
aggressive again and millions of refugees are on the hike.   <br>

129. <b>Development:</b> Threat of regional nuclear conflict when more and more countries
and
potentially terrorist groups will have access to nuclear weapons.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Chaos, in case of unsuccessful transition of countries in the
former
Soviet Union, also struggle for new geopolitical <b>Domains:</b> in the world.<br>
<b>Potential Goals:</b> Difficult to say. Development in Russia especially is practically
unpredictable
now.<br>

3.  <b>Development:</b> Nuclear terrorism and proliferation pose far more of a threat to the
survival
of the human species than is generally appreciated. Almost everyone knows that the stuff is "bad,"
but the
INTEGRATED implications for the global system are what's misunderstood.<br>
<b>Description:</b> DOE analyses of things like the diversion of nuclear materials tend to lead
to bad
stuff out there proportional to the product of two variables: (1) the volume of material moving
around;
(2) the average slackness of the control over its movement, at the micro level, wherever it is
moving.
Both variables have been on an alarming growth curve, and will have to grow even a whole lot
faster in
the future, if we don't develop other alternative energy sources (besides nuclear) fast enough.
There are
people responsible for proliferation policy who will say "The cat's already out of the bag anyway"
-- but
the sheer size of the cat can turn into another kind of beast.   Furthermore, once the nuclear
capabilities
do proliferate far enough -- once the number of actors increases by an order of magnitude or two,
the
number of actors with delivery systems also increases, and the level of craziness of the craziest
actors
increases, the probability of a weapon being used on people will grow by orders of magnitude.
This leads
to two possible scenarios: (1) the "Herman Kahn" scenario, where using nuclear weapons no
longer
becomes unthinkable, and the precedent breeds far more use; (2) the extreme revulsion scenario
(which I
tend to believe), where the public overreaction -- a thousand times as powerful as the reaction to
Chernobyl, which was already quite chilling -- leads to violently anti-technological regimes,
regimes
powerful enough to stifle economic growth and innovation to the point where human survival is
really put
into question.<br>
<b>Strategies:</b> Oh do I wish I had the answer to that! But a friend who used to ghost-write a
lot of
the Los Alamos effort in this field tells me that it would help if we simply put things back under
the
purview of people who really care about the issue and are tough-minded about details. Also, I can
imagine some hopes for improved US-China collaboration straightening things out, but that in
turn would
take a lot of effort. The general effort to reduce famine and despair by limiting population growth
would
certainly help a little, in the long-term. In the short term, the India-Pakistan situation is an obvious
one to
work harder on.<br>

134. <b>Summary:</b> The rise of international terrorism. <br>
<b>Development:</b> As the gap in living standards between developed and under developed
countries
increases, the latter, in view of the fruitlessness of traditional methods of warfare are likely to
resort,
more and more, to the use of terrorism, possibly including nuclear blackmail.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Too obvious to mention.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> A massive shift in resources from traditional national defense to anti-terrorism.
While
current expenditures in these respects may on the order of 10:1 they may well have to tend
toward a 1:1
ratio.<br>

37. <b>Summary:</b> High-tech terrorism.<br>
<b>Development:</b>  Single individuals and small groups will be able, through technological
advances,  to decisively affect and/or disrupt regional, national and global processes, even
worldwide
development.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b>  Increased fragility of global systems allows for massive
transfers of
power to individuals and groups unconstrained by commonly accepted rules of behavior. 
Terrorism and
blackmail in unprecedented scales will become major threats to world civilization.   Indecisive or
untimely
responses by society to these challenges will reinforce existing incentives to challenge all
established
rules.  Many concerned groups will advocate limiting freedom and increased government
surveillance and
repression.  Some others will even try to limit technology's development. <br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b> Plan to build resilience and redundancies into socio-technical systems to
avoid possible catastrophic disruptions.  International cooperation in tracking and punishing
terrorists.<br>

70. <b>Summary:</b> Organized crime groups are becoming sophisticated global enterprises
with the
technical know-how to yield enormous illegal profits (information fraud, organ traffic, arms
traffic, etc.).
<br>
<b>Development:</b> (Examples include: 1991 bank fraud of $2.2 billion; telephone fraud $4
billion,
credit card fraud, $1.5 billion). Information technology is accelerating the movement and quality
of
money and information. (US financial institutions transfer over one trillion dollars via computer
networks
daily). Facilitates global operations.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Get ahead of organized crime networks using more advanced technology and
establishing international criminal law; address new crime areas such as illegal waste disposal,
human
organ traffic and arms traffic.<br>

107. <b>Development:</b> The public becoming fed up with crime, recidivism, and liberal
courts:
reinstitution of the death penalty, harsher penalties, pushing the limits of "cruel and unusual"
penalties.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Tougher sentences, overcrowded jails, and possibly lowering
crime
rate<br>

131. <b>Development:</b> A generation of children whose behavior has includeded extreme
criminality
at an early age, resulting in an increasing siege mentality among law-abiding citizens.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Increasing siege mentality among law abiding citizens, demands
for
restrictions on civil liberties, including eventually, the introduction of martial law for the purpose
of
ridding the country of illegal weapons.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Long term reintroduction (through several decades) socially acceptable values,
encompassing responsible behavior and caring for others.<br>

54. <b>Development:</b> Violence as a global problem. Sources, instruments, promotion and
exploitation of violence abound (movies, TV, drugs, fundamentalism, racism, terrorism).   <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> increasing insecurity, destabilization of governments, social
disorder,
economic injustice, institutional and legal failure.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Global approach to global violence; global institutions with real although limited
powers,
that control violence on its bases; education and  mass media supporting solidarity, negotiation,
peace
building in global scale, and peaceful conflict resolution through mediation and the rule of law.

kinds of
violence.                            <p>
                                  
103. <b>Development:</b> Introduction into military, police and terrorist arsenals of non-lethal
weapons, including for example, aerosols that induce sleep, and sticky foams.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> New tools for dealing with crime, new tools for
persuasion.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> This development should be watched. There will be less restraint in employing
such
weapons, therefore a higher likelihood of their use.<br>

128. <b>Development:</b> Violence in the mass media and aggressive advertising supporting the
increasing expectations of consumer society that cannot be fulfilled in real life (it concerns mainly
people
in developing countries and the poor in cities of the developed world).<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Violence in the world. Crime and organized crime that is
becoming in
many countries and regions as powerful as governments (e. g. Colombia, present day Russia);
terrorism
(often supported by government); militant religious fanaticism (as an acute form of religious
fundamentalism) and ethnic intolerance.<br>
<b>Potential Goals:</b> Global governance, new security strategy and reform of the Security
Council
of UNO; looking for alternatives to the consumer society (e.g. sustainable society).<br>

55. <b>Development:</b> Globalisation: increasingly clear demand for global thinking,
responsibility,
ethics, approach, effort, action, and results. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> The global process is a result of a naked power process without
legal
rules and without ethical foundation. I repeat here what I said before: There is a clear demand for
"global
thinking", "global responsibility", "global ethics", "global approach", "global effort", "global
action" and
"global results". And should be added "global institutions, global implementation of global
solutions to
global problems" Three main areas should be considered : a) the global process as it is, as it
appears on its
reality. This is a matter of a diagnostic and futures research; b) the cyberspace and Internet  and
all
networks of networks to come as the infostructure of the new global order. This is a mater of
socialware
and interdisciplinary approach of social sciences combined with digital technologies of
information,
communication, decisions and organization; and c)  the Global Common Good as the
philosophical
foundation of global law, global institutions, global ethic and global culture.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> To consider the global process from a global point of view: not only the advance
of
industrialized countries over the developing countries, but also as the possibilities of developing
countries
to act in the world arena. To achieve a balance of activities from global to regional and local as
well as
from local to regional and global..<br>

63. <b>Development:</b> Space as insurance against the destruction of humanity<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> The development of space colonies may be earlier then
expected,
driven by political demands of electorates wanting this form of insurance.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Earlier development of space colonies<br>

2.  <b>Summary:</b> The global Islamic community beginning to adopt futures thinking in
establishing
its plans and goals.<br>
<b>Development:</b> Discussions about use of futures research in development of Islamic
thought re
futures. At a high level conference in March 1996, at Kuala Lumpur, speakers argued that new
simulation
models were necessary using Islamic renderings of concepts of population, ecology, social justice
and
unity and non-linear approaches to understanding the future. To begin this task it was first
necessary for
the Ummah, the Islamic community, to rescue itself from limited nationalistic/dynastic discourses
and
from Western language frames.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Convergence of Western and Islamic views or the future and
development of a new basis for discourse.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> To foster this development.<br>

12. <b>Summary:</b> Increasing complexity of issues that lead to conflict, outstripping ability of
institutions to anticipate and deal with the issues.<br>
<b>Development:</b>  The complexity of conflict, and of potential conflict issues, is growing
faster
than the ability of people to comprehend and explore effectively.  Concurrent availability of
educated,
retired individuals willing to contribute their professional skills. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b>  Increasing difficulty in identifying emerging conflicts and in
approaching them competently.  Lack of societal resources being devoted to the problem is likely
to
compound the problem by preventing the development of structures that can anticipate conflicts
at all
levels of societies and in the international community, and address them rapidly and efficiently. 
Waste of
valuable human resources.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b> Volunteers in monitoring systems, and as mediators, to identify and
intervene in
emerging conflicts at the local, national and/or regional level, within a coordinated structure that
provides
logistic, training and continuity support.<br>

13. <b>Summary:</b> Failure of education system to develop leadership skills <br>
<b>Development:</b> Fewer and fewer resources are being devoted to management /leadership
competence development (as distinct from the functional/job-specific skills, like accounting, health
care,
research, MIS, etc.), just when these competencies are becoming increasingly critical in solving
the
mounting stress and other people problems in organizations.  In the private sector and even in the
public
arena, replacement needs of retiring workers will probably maintain a fairly high level of
employment, at
least for some time.  Still, the personal stresses associated with reduced security in the face of the
need to
avoid technological obsolescence, will require ever higher leadership skills from middle and lower
level
managers. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b>  Increasing social and workplace strife; growing disenchantment
by
people who have worked and cannot find new employment, because they were not coached and
counseled in basic work competencies at their previous positions; more individuals without
adequate
education out on the street; more waste of human and material resources, etc.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>High level competence at the middle and lower management levels with
strong
skills in all areas connected with setting appropriate, challenging and realistic goals, achieving a
highly
motivational climate with strong positive discipline, avoidance of conflict, continuous
improvement of
competencies and quality, etc. <br>

67. <b>Development:</b> Increasing failure of governance in 1st world countries due to inability
to
manage complex systems in a global village -- widening gap between rate of technological change
and
societal/institutional change.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Growing popular discontent offers a ready opening for
demagogues
and fundamentalists, possibly even an anti-technology movement as technology is blamed for job
insecurity, certainly pressures for populist dictatorships (left and right).<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Reduce the widening gap between tech and societal/institutional change by
promoting
fluidity and experimentation to develop new institutional concepts.<br>

68. <b>Development:</b> Information/communication technologies increasing the ability to
simultaneously decentralize/localize/fragment and to centralize/globalize/integrate.<br>
<b>Potential Consequence:</b> Decline of the role of the nation state and the rise of sub national
(e.g.
local) and super-national (e.g. global) power, decentralization and globalization of corporations;
localization and globalization of media (e-mail and CNN).<br>

national-
global aspects of management and control ( e.g. coordination- intensive structures).<br>

72. <b>Development:</b> A pre-occupation with  power at all levels of society (and in our
education
system).<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Although power driven individuals might appear successful in
the
short term those behavior patterns inevitably lead to destruction (usually through the abuse of
power/corruption) in the longer term.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> To encourage everyone (particularly those with 'power) to take a more
responsibility-
driven approach to decision-making.<br>

124. <b>Development:</b> Ineffectiveness of political and economic institutions, above all on
supranational level.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> Growing tensions between states, growing nationalism; ethnic
groups
or nations within existing states can fight for establishing new, sovereign states; growing
difficulties to
deal with global problems which cannot be solved at a national level (environmental problems,
refugees,
etc.)<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>To decentralize certain powers (the principle of subsidiaity -- let
everything be
decided at the lowest level at which it is possible), to centralize other powers in the hands viable
and
effective supranational institutions (how big a challenge is clear from observing the present
functioning of
the UNO and the negotiations concerning the principles of the functioning of the European Union,
etc.)<br>

65. <b>Development:</b>  Capitalism stands essentially unchallenged as the dominant economic
system
throughout the world.  During the 20th century, a number of alternative approaches to organizing
economic activity have failed to establish credibility.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b>  Average living standards may rise as rates of growth associated
with
capitalism become the norm worldwide.  Political freedom may spread along with free markets. 
But, the
challenge to existing political and cultural values may lead to societal breakdown, reaction and
violence. 
The unchecked political-economic power of global corporations may become increasingly
problematic, as
their values do not necessarily reflect the interests of people in general.  Popular alternative
ideologies
may gain in strength, and may well lead in non-democratic directions.<br>
<b>Potential Goals:</b>  Develop economically sophisticated theory and democratic institutions
that
can appropriately "control "global capitalism, prevent excesses, and protect people's rights to
make their 
own cultural and political choices.  Ideally, do this with minimum negative impact on economic
growth.<br>

121. <b>Development:</b> Europe turns into a major world player, rejuvenates and creates a
new
identity of the occident.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> The US is invited to join. Other world players are US (including
NAFTA), India, China, South East Asia under Japanese supremacy, and some conglomerate of
the
Islamic world. Europe stays defensive, predominantly anti-military, anti-imperialistic and
anti-invasive.<br>

126. <b>Development:</b> The uneven and unfair distribution of wealth among nations
(North/South
divide) and also within nations (rate of incomes between the 20% of the population with the
lowest
incomes is in Columbia, e.g., roughly 25:1; in western European countries it is about 8:1).<br>
<b>Potential Consequences:</b> The developed world can be faced with the threat that it will
become
a "ghetto of the rich" surrounded by overpopulated, poor, frustrated and aggressive "rest of
mankind."
Even inside the developed countries, ethnic tensions will increase not only as a result of a wave of
immigration from poorer and unstable regions but also because of unbalanced population growth
among
single ethnic groups.<br>
<b>Potential Goals:</b> Creation of limited "global governance" by establishing effective and
viable
supranational institutions (reformed UNO...) and implementation of the "Global Marshall
Plan."<br>

The second round of the 1996 Global Look-Out questionnaire comes in two sections.  You
should already have Section 1. Section 2 includes the full text of developments in only one of the
six Millennium Project domains.  Selection of the domain sent to you was based on your first
round responses, resume, publications, previous expressions of interest and or our best judgment. 
If you want to comment and add to the full text of developments in other domains, please
download them from the Millennium Project's home page:
<i>http//nko.mhpcc.edu/millennium/Millennium_Project.html</i> or request them from the
Project's coordinating office.<p>

In this second section, you are asked for comments, improvements, or additions to the material
submitted by yourself and others in the first round.  You do not have to comment on every
development in this domain, just those developments that are important to you and to which
you can contribute new consquences, strategies, and references. <p>

You can respond in several ways:<p>

1. If you received the material via email or downloaded it from the homepage, you can simply
insert you YOUR COMMENTS IN CAPITAL LETTERS or in
>some other way to identify your additions into the text and submit the whole domain back via

9. <b>Summary:</b> Increasingly apparent conflicts between economic and societal aims:
economic
measurement and incentives subvert social growth.<br>
<b>Development:</b>  The past few decades in particular have demonstrated that the ease with
which
economic goals can be quantified has caused societal aims, based mainly upon non-quantifiable
human
values, to either  become converted into economic commodities or to become neglected entirely. 
In
essence, all the ills of present inequities, topics and issues which place our future at risk and
pervert
individuals and entire governments at present can be traced to this conversion and the neglect of
those
characteristics which imply civility within a civilization. <br>
     Most of the basic tenets of free market economic are so closely matched to the natural and
inherent properties and aspirations in man that constraining the excesses of free market economics
is
widely assumed to undermine fundamental human freedoms, risk the survival of governments,
organizations and people and must therefore be accepted as an undesirable but necessary penalty
for
exercising free choice, as a prerequisite to survival.<br>
     Those familiar with system theory know that natural systems, and this includes societies,
ecosystems and others, reach stability through complexity of the interactions and
interdependencies of its 
subsystems.  Free market economic behavior more so than economic theory tends to strive for
simplicity
which undermines systems stability.  The rising tide of discontent within societies indicates that
societal
systems have already become less stable through the process of simplification through economic
quantification and evaluation.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Economic colonialization is markedly different from traditional
colonialization because there is no single society or group of societies which does the colonizing. 
The
presumed economic colonizers such as the United States, Germany, Japan and others are
themselves
becoming colonized because their societies become perverted by the same economic system which
is
spreading globally with noble aims but sinister in its consequences.<br>  
     Basically, therefore, societies everywhere are being exploited by a virtual colonial power, by a
concept, by practices, by the invisible hand which has become an assertive fist.  Metaphorically 
speaking,
man has allowed, by default, to extend the food chain which is now dominated by a virtual species
which
has relegated man to the role of the foodstuff that maintains its existence, growth, multiplication
and
dominance.<br>
     It has created a new uni-culture which subscribes to economic values over human values, yet it
were human values that allowed mankind to arrive in the present time frame.  The consequences
of  this
transformation of human values into bankable currencies is a root cause which drives all other
topics and
issues with few exceptions.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>Constrain economic practices into compliance with human goals. 
Without
fundamentally altering economic theories which is inherently hazardous and largely unnecessary,
encourage the disciplined development of means for quantifying human goals and for linkages of 
these
goals to economic theories and practices which preserve free market economic concepts but limit
economic excesses.  <br>

10. <b>Summary:</b> Growth in the number of aging seniors places burden on younger
generation.<br>
<b>Development:</b>  As benefits of industrial society are realized, the life span increases, birth
rate
decreases and there are increasing numbers of aged seniors, causing ever greater burden on
younger
generation. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> As Ted Roszak writes: "Barring another Black Plague, the
future of
industrial nations is filled with increasing numbers of seniors all of whom will eventually claim the
retirement benefits they have been guaranteed.  Longevity is the new population problem.  Ever
more
dependent seniors filling hospitals, nursing homes, and retirement communities, living out a
second life
that frequently stretches twenty and thirty years beyond retirement. The cost of maintaining a
growing
population is astronomical.   <br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>To revision aging as a time to realize untapped human potential needed
to care
for and rebuild the  human community.  Find the way to activate meaningful functions for seniors
in
contributing to their communities.  Realize that the issue of life purpose and meaningful work will
become ever more pressing,  as not only for seniors, but also adults will be "downside," under or
unemployed.  As Jeremy Rifkin writes, we are approaching "the end of work" as we have known
it.  This
can be a great opportunity to release creativity for vocation, life purpose and life-long learning. 
We must
develop an economic system that supports people in doing their best.  We need a combination of
Louis
Kelso's Two Factor Theory of Universal Capitalism, whereby workers and even those on welfare
borrow
on the future earnings of stocks and become owners of the increased productivity of the machines. 
We
also need to develop local community-based currencies outside the commercial monetary system,
and
perhaps some sort of guaranteed annual income as proposed by Robert Theobald and others.

53. <b>Summary:</b> The inability of developing countries to use developed technology.<br>
<b>Development:</b> The USTeD syndrome: (In Spanish <i>el Uso Subdesarrollado de las
Tecnologias Desarrolladas</i>) The Underdeveloped Use of Developed Technologies. This
syndrome  is
the result of a complex relation between Advanced Technologies and Social Systems whereby the
power
of technology is limited by the ignorance of the user.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>The expansion of digital technologies does not mean effective
use of
these technologies in the developing world. Therefore, developing countries are attractive markets
as
"consumers" of digital technologies---PC's and accessories-- without the benefit of the correct use
of
information, communication, decision and organization technologies. Hence, advanced
technologies are
really making the rich richer and the poor poorer. <br>
<b>Goals:</b> Reverse the tendency denounced by the USTeD syndrome through extended
programs
in education and special training emphasizing the human factor in information/ communication
systems.
Apply information/communication technologies in developing  countries in such way that improve
productivity in small low level popular communities.  Digital or electronic communities should
flourished
in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and, in general in Africa, Asia and Latin
America.

57. <b>Development:</b> Improving the economic status of many "developing" countries, thus
increasing global demand for food, energy and manufactured products.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Consumer demands in "developing" countries will  have more
influence
on world markets and economies. In heavily populated countries like China, a very small increase
in
affluence and consumer demand will have significant implications for the global economy and the
environment. <br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>Encourage environmentally-sustainable development in these growing
economies. Educate consumers globally about the social and environmental implications of their
demands
and choices. Expand education programs related to reproduction options and population
control.<br>

74. <b>Development:</b>  The widening economic gap between the 'haves' and 'have nots' within
and
between countries.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Increased instability and conflict; both by groups and
individually. <br>
<b>Goals:</b> More policies that focus directly on this area--or in a decade or two all we will be
doing
will be attempting to deal with the damaging consequences of neglect.<br>

85. <b>Development:</b> High population growth and high educational achievement of many
developing nations produces more highly educated citizens than their economies can productively
employ<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Rich source of talent for economies with flat or negative
population
growth rates (developed nations).  Also rich source for developed-world organizations seeking to
develop a presence in the developing world.   Disgruntlement of populace forced to settle for
underemployment. Educated women may question long-held cultural norms/practices (for
example,
birthrates).  Disgruntlement with government that cannot create enough jobs. <br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b> Education drives entrepreneurial economic expansion on an
unprecedented
scale.  Governments foster  it by making capital available for small-business start-up.<br>

29. <b>Development:</b> Interactive information technology (IT) systems become widely used
in
work, education, and other social functions.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Increase in social mobility, economic efficiency,
entrepreneurship,
isolation, complexity, risk of system failures, etc.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Develop effective IT systems to serve these purposes, as well as protocols that
avoid
social disruption.<br>

35. <b>Development:</b>  Increase in the impact of new technologies, especially in the service
sector.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Growth of unemployment in service sector and need to devise
social 
security systems which are very difficult given the current world economic situation.<br>
<b>Goals:</b>  Invest in information,  updating of professional employees, and increase
knowledge of
the new technologies emerging  that might influence employment in the service sector.<br>

137. <b>Summary:</b> Changing composition of the workforce; shift in labor from industrial to
service
sector<br>
<b>Development:</b> Workplace opportunities in traditional "production" occupations has fallen
below
30% of the workforce, whereas the "management and administrative" opportunities now approach
40%
of the workforce. Furthermore,"technical and professional" occupations which now represent
20% of the
workforce, far exceed the "service" category. These relentless trends make obsolete our
traditional
approaches to training and educating new workers as well as the approaches to retraining and
educating
the existing workforce.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>The human capital implications of these trends has created an
acrimonious political debate as the economy is restructured by technological and social forces
now
exerting their powerful influence. Populations are frightened for their economic security; society
could be
polarized more strongly between those with and without employable skills; conspiracies,
constructed and
amplified to "explain" to those who do not benefit could lead to social unrest and disruptions;
terrorist an
luddite responses could result.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>To respond to these rapid socioeconomic changes, recognize the
fundamental
changes required in the educational, training, and vocational systems as well as reconfigure the
nature of
work and of knowledge workers as the information economy developes. Exploit new knowledge
and
implications of cognitive science for designing learning environments. Exploit the emerging
information
technologies as enablers in achieving educational/training goals.<br>

28. <b>Development:</b> Decentralization of institutions; big corporations are breaking up into
small,
self-supporting units, big government welfare state policies are being dismantled.<br>
<b>Consequences: </b>People will become dependent on themselves for financial and social
support,
producing a rise in poverty, crime, political disruption.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Define a workable model of self-governance for semi-autonomous business units,
local
communities, and other social structures.<br>

technologies are
shrinking space and time (the global village).<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>The need to expand our space-time horizons.<br>

75. <b>Development:</b> Natural resources are being bought up by international cartels, with
unprecedented speed and scale, as much as 60% of gold, 30% of silver, and 80% of platinum.
Besides
these strategic metals, grains and even water are being targeted. In a decade, 70% of the natural
resources in the world will be controlled by private financial powers.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>World politics and business will be influenced by these cartels.
Manufacturing sites as well as government planning will be at the mercy of these power-hungry
cartels.
As a result, tension will be increased over limited natural resources. <br>
<b>Goals:</b> Establish a monitoring mechanism of these destructive activities of cartels and
provide an
early warning signal for nation states to conduct their smooth production of goods enacting an
international code of resource protection.<br>

76. <b>Summary:</b> Family business increasing its presence, power and influence over many
aspects
of politics, economics and culture.<br>
<b>Development:</b> Multi-generational family enterprises are exerting a predominant power in
each
field without proper market competition or public scrutiny. More than 1/3 of Fortune 500 and
85% of all
companies are family controlled.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>A small number of political and business families will control the
government and private institutions. Their concern will be their own family succession and
protection of
their wealth, not public welfare nor general well being in each country. Such accumulation of
wealth and
power will inevitably invite a revolt from the suppressed public and bring about a social unrest on
a global
scale.<br>
<b>Goals:</b> Increase awareness of the danger associated with these monopolies by political
and
economic families among the media and public. More governments enact an anti-monopoly law
on the
international scale and standard.<br>

88. <b>Development:</b> Environmentally-adverse forms of energy perpetuated in part because
of
economic distortions and incomplete accounting for costs.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> The world continues to use fossil fuels as its dominant energy
source
to a greater extent, vis a vis renewable sources, than is warranted because, for various historic and
political reasons, such forms are protected and subsidized, prices are kept low, encouraging
waste, and
the situation is exacerbated by lack of agreement on an appropriate methodology to achieve
full-cost
accounting for external and environmental effects and impacts.<br>
<b>Goal:</b> Achieve a better balance of energy sources by implementing full-cost accounting
for
external and environmental effects and impacts.<br>

<font size=+1>FULL-TEXT OF DEVELOPMENTS</font></center><p>
<br>
The second round of the 1996 Global Look-Out questionnaire comes in two sections.  You
should already have Section 1. Section 2 includes the full text of developments in only one of the
six Millennium Project domains.  Selection of the domain sent to you was based on your first
round responses, resume, publications, previous expressions of interest and or our best judgment. 
If you want to comment and add to the full text of developments in other domains, please
download them from the Millennium Project's home page:
<i>http//nko.mhpcc.edu/millennium/Millennium_Project.html</i> or request them from the
Project's coordinating office.<p>

In this second section, you are asked for comments, improvements, or additions to the material
submitted by yourself and others in the first round.  You do not have to comment on every
development in this domain, just those developments that are important to you and to which
you can contribute new consquences, strategies, and references. <p>

You can respond in several ways:<p>

1. If you received the material via email or downloaded it from the homepage, you can simply
insert you YOUR COMMENTS IN CAPITAL LETTERS or in
>some other way to identify your additions into the text and submit the whole domain back via
email >to<i> jglenn@igc.org.</i><p>

2.  You need not include the full text in your response.  You can simply write the reference
number for the development followed by your additions and email, fax, or mail it back.<p>

4. <b>Development: </b>Development of affordable cars that produce 1/3 the amount of CO2,
are
otherwise pollution free and do not require petroleum. <br>
<b>Description:</b> We are very close, technologically, to being able to mass produce affordable
cars
which don't need to use oil, and are virtually pollution free (if you don't count CO2, which is only
reduced
by a factor of three...). But the engineering and deployment challenges are considerable.<br>
<b>Details:</b> Maybe this is generally known; maybe not. The White House has hosted several
meetings and press conferences, anyway, on the "Partnership for a Next Generation Vehicle"
(PNGV),
for which most of the government money goes into fuel-cell electric cars, which have the
attributes listed
above.<br>
<b>Strategies:</b> A big issue. Clearly, there is a need for both government and industry activity
-- but
the right mix seems to be an issue that gets revisited every two months or so. One strategy is to
push
FOR THE TIME BEING for new fuel processors which make it possible to use natural gas or
diesel fuel
or home heating oil (!) in the short-term, in these kinds of cars, to get them out onto the market;
then,
this opens the door for new fuels like methanol and hydrogen. Many of us believe that hydrogen is
less
practical than claimed, but that methanol can be made in the long-term in a sustainable way that
does not
even produce net carbon dioxide. Even in the short-term, co-production of methanol and
electricity will
permit low methanol prices, enough to displace oil sooner than many believe. This is another area
where
international cooperation could be extremely valuable, for a number of reasons, if the US
technology
holders can be reassured that their rights will be protected even as they provide a product that
other
countries badly need and can help produce.<br>

27. <b>Development: </b>Doubling of the demand for energy in less than 30 years as a result of
population and economic growth.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> A new shortage of oil could occur before 2020. Greenhouse
gas
emissions could rise to intolerable levels.  Nuclear energy will not be able to close the gaps.<br>
<b>Goals: </b> A quadrupling within 30-50 years of energy productivity, i.e. the output in energy
services per primary energy input.  This appears to be technically feasible according to a new
book,
<i>Factor Four - Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use</i>.  This amounts to nothing less than
redirecting technological progress from pure labor productivity towards labor and resource
productivity. 
I assume it should be profitable in macroeconomics terms.<br>

135. <b>Development: </b>China is becoming an economic world power. While this is not
imminent, it
is likely to occur within the first few decades of the new century.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>All major industrialized countries will be affected, possibly
leading to
intense trade wars or even military action.<br>
<b>Goal: </b>Seek to induce China in a timely fashion to participate in firm international trade
pacts
while conforming to internationally acceptable human rights standards. To achieve this it may well
be
necessary to create a Union of Democracies, aside from and parallel to the United Nations, that
through
united actions forces recalcitrant nations such as present day China to abide by set standards of
international commerce.<br>

83. <b>Development: </b>Gridlock: Excessive urban motor vehicle traffic congestion,  resulting
pollution, and political backlash.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Significant economic impact due to gridlock. Carless urban
corridors. 
Active promotion of non-polluting alternatives. Purchase price or tax on vehicles being linked to
resource
consumption. Community planning for pedestrian, human powered transport.  Use of  IT to
decrease
need to travel (e-cash doesn't require trip to bank/ATM), suburb ban works sites or
telecommuting
reduces need to travel to urban core).          <br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b> Create vehicles which actually clean the atmosphere (exhaust of vehicle
is
cleaner than the air coming into it). Cooperative/public travel arrangements and/or long-range
community
planning to minimize congestion. Double-decker freeways (outside earthquake areas!). Human
powered
modes of transport with infrastructure (roads, lockers, etc.) to support it, make it safe).<br>

109. <b>Development: </b>Increasing appearance of estrogen mimicking compounds in the
environment resulting from the breakdown of plastics, insecticides, and other manufactured
materials. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>  Potentially diminished fertility and reproductive capacity of
males of
all species, including human males, disappearance of some species, backlash against chemical and
industrial industries, rise in organic agriculture, pressure for cloning research, sperm banks more
popular.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>Coordinated research and funding by producers of these compounds to
produce
substitution compounds that do not affect reproduction, and production of a simple
self-administered
diagnostic test to determine current status of these compounds' existence in the body, current
effect on
the subject's body, treatment options.<br>

<b>Comment from Round 1 (Godoy): </b>The increasing appearance of estrogen mimicking
compounds in the environment resulting from the breakdown of plastics, insecticides, and other
manufactured materials is one specific aspect of the universe of environmental problems suffering
humankind. While environment problems do not recognize political boundaries, political systems
does. It
should be accepted by all governments that unless a dip change happened at the political level,
there will
not be a solution to any of the most dangerous environmental problems. It is perhaps "the" most
clear
demand for "global thinking", "global responsibility", "global ethics", "global approach", "global
effort",
"global action" and "global results".              <p>

8. <b>Summary: </b>Increasing number of micro-organisms that are immune to pharmaceuticals
or
pesticides.<br>
<b>Development: </b>In medicine as well as in agriculture, an increasing number of
micro-organisms
and insects have become immune to intervention by pharmaceutical means or pesticides.  In
addition to
natural agents which are hostile to human interests, man has created the paradox of increasing the
potency of this hostility through ill-managed innovations originally conceived to overcome it.
     In medicine - A net increase in the vulnerability of humans to diseases for which cures are
becoming more difficult, more costly and perhaps unable to obtain.  While diseases such as HIV
do not
spread through casual exposure, other air and water-born diseases can be spread readily and pose
a
perhaps more menacing threat than HIV, Ebola and others which receive more attention. 
Resistant
strains have the potential to more rapidly and more quickly affect a far larger number of people
and with
far more devastating consequences than any other presently known threat.
     In agriculture - Increasing the potency of herbicides and insecticides increases the potential for
significant and perhaps more stealth health risks for humans, not only through the food grown but
also
through drinking water and aquatic life polluted by runoff from chemically treated fields.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b> 
A  Medicine
a  Impose severe disciplinary measures on physicians who  prescribe antibiotics indiscriminately
b    Provide a combinations of incentives and disincentives  for pharmaceutical companies to
produce still
effective antibiotics for which patents have expired.  Since these antibiotics reduce the profitability
of
their production in favor of more exotic proprietary pharmaceuticals, new approaches are called
for to
facilitate their production and use.
c    Provide for more controlled environments and/or conditions  to assure that patients who take
antibiotics take them beyond the point where symptoms subside.  Early termination of a
prescribed rigor
for taking certain medications encourages the survival of the most resistant micro-organisms
which
fosters the emergence of new resistant strains on a grander scale.
B    Agriculture
a  Provide incentives to dramatically increase the number of cultivators of insects (for example)
that are
natural enemies of organisms which are now being fought with chemicals.  Examples are ladybugs
feeding
on aphids. Provide dis-incentives for the use of chemicals which can be eliminated in cases where
cultivated natural organisms can be successfully employed.<br>

49. <b>Development: </b>Essentially full control of the genetic and biochemical processes of
living
organisms.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Eradication of existing communicable and non-communicable
diseases;
limitation of these achievements to the rich areas of the world; increase of differences between
areas
ending in a global destructive conflict.<br>

50. <b>Summary: </b>Adoption of an effects-oriented approach to the monitoring of ecological
systems, rather than measuring contaminents or physical-chemical properties.<br>
<b>Development: </b> Monitoring the condition of ecological systems for assessment and
decisionmaking.  Rather than separately measuring contaminants only, or physico-chemical
properties
only, of the environmental media (a practice typical of compliance monitoring), an effects oriented
approach is adopted (similar to the practices of medical diagnosis and epidemiology). Various
indicators
of the condition of ecological resources disclose status of as well as trends and changes in
condition.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Such approaches hold the promise for the conduct of more
proactive
(rather than reactive) environmental protection and management activities.  <br>
<b>Goals: </b>While the scientific community has long called for support of such approaches
(and the
public has indicated interest in having simple metrics for discerning the condition of ecological
systems,
the approaches have not garnered, as yet, high-level governmental support due to the necessarily
long-term nature of investment needed for generating the data for programs operating under such
approaches.<br>

60. <b>Summary: </b>Initiate a search for and catalog the vast variety of bacteria of the planet.
<br>
<b>Development: </b>Uncover new resources, e.g. the flora of this planet has at least a million
different
species of bacteria, of which about are known and (partially) understood.  Considering what little
we do
know, and their usefulness and basically benign character, it seems that a simple, easily available
resource
is going untapped.  A project (similar to the Human Genome mapping project) to identify, study,
and
utilize bacteria could discover new and cheaper foodstuffs.  Also bacteria could have great
importance to
health and welfare of humans, perhaps even for the viability of the World (viz. less pollution from
improved industrial processes).<br>

127. <b>Development: </b>Destruction of the environment, especially loss of biodiversity.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Because of the destruction of the environment (depletion of
rainforests,
desertification...) the generic variety of life is threatened -- genetic, generic, ecosystemic --  but
with
people, and also cultural diversity. Euro-American culture is dominant on the planet; Islamic,
Hispanic,
Chinese and some other cultures may try to resist, but tropical forests disappear.<br>
<b>Potential <b>Goals: </b></b>Political priority for international environmental protection and
sustainable development, implementation of Agenda 21 from "Rio 92 Conference". (UN
Conference on
Environment and Development.)<br>

14. <b>Summary: </b>A false sense of security about the extent of natural resources.<br>
<b>Development: </b> The attention to diminishing natural resources which was prominent in the
literature during the 60s and 70s has faded into the background, especially since the early 80s.
There is a
widespread, yet probably inappropriate optimism that either resources are so vast that there is no
need to
address the problem now, or that new discoveries and technology can overcome any problems
that might
arise.  The optimism does not extend to some resources such as water and possibly air, but it does
extend
to almost all metals and fossil fuels.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Serious disruptions, even crises, and possible international
conflict, as
shortages develop, possibly as far as decades in the future. <br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>National and international material conservation agreements and
procedures,
with competitive incentives for conservation of natural resources in production and possibly also
in
consumption.<br>

20. <b>Development: </b>Environment and Climate Program (CEC)<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>To support the investigation and further advanced education on
specific
topics at the forefront of scientific and technological development in Europe.<br>
<b>Goals: </b>Sea level change; biogeochemical cycles of nutrients; atmospheric chemistry and
stratospheric ozone' human dimension of environmental change.<br>

21. <b>Development: </b>Consortia for International Earth Science Information Network
(CEISIN)<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Recognition by many expert bodies and national governments
that an
understanding of human interactions in the environment is indispensable to understanding
environmental
change.<br>

41. <b>Development: </b>Corporate support for sustainable concepts<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>The most immediate result is increased resource efficiency
within
practical economic limits. Reduced pollution.  Shift to a longer term, holistic or systemic
perspective. <br>
<b>Goals: </b>Two primary <b>Goals: </b>1) Support for legislation/international agreements
leading
to support of sustainable development; 2) Responsible sale/transfer of technology to emerging
countries. 
(Avoid events similar to the sale of inefficient refrigerator technology to China.)<br>

86. <b>Development: </b>More than 60 provincial and 22 national Comprehensive Experimental
Community for Sustainable Development (CECSD) have been set up in China since 1992. Much
progress
has been made on the social, economic and environmental development in CECSD.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Fulfill sustainable development catalyzed by science and
technology
involving many aspects as economy, society, population, resources and environment.
Development of
people are the core of and economic development is the central task of CECSD. Environmentally
sound,
economic productive and systematically responsible production, institution, life style, people's
capacity
and ecological order will be encouraged in CECSD.<br>
<b>Potential <b>Goals: </b></b>Through building CECSD to realize a resource saving type of
economic development model, to development human resources and pay great attention to
capacity
building, to meet and satisfy the increasing basic needs of people and improve over all quality of
life, to
create and maintain a clean and healthy environment.<br>

87. <b>Development: </b>Sustainable Technology Demonstration Project (STDP) is sponsored
by the
State Science and Technology Commission (China) to introducing environmentally sound,
economically
productive and systematically responsible technologies to the demonstration towns and
communities for
community sustainable development. <br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Enhance the role of science and technology in community
development
and introduce the mechanism and develop an instrument for technology transfer. Evaluate, select
and
aggregate systematic technologies for sustainable development. Test several kinds of typical
sustainable
technology for demonstration. Setup scientific and technological information system and
consultation
network for demonstration communities.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>Set up 5 technological systems for community development including (1)
Capacity building and technology consultation, (2) Comprehensive utilization of agricultural
resource, (3)
Deepening processing and regeneration of industrial resource and wastes, (4) Town ecological
construction and restoration, (5) Community service and social welfare.<br>

142. <b>Development: </b>Increasing pressure under the seabed associated with the plates'
movement,
accumulating energy to cause earthquakes, especially around Tokyo area.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b>Potential risk of earthquakes of a large scale, causing fires and
tidal
waves, human losses; if happened to Tokyo area (it is said that a large scale one can hit Tokyo at
anytime, since they tend to occur every 70-80 years these centuries, and the last one was in 1920
or so),
that would be disastrous not only for Japan but also for the rest of the world, causing high
casualty, fires,
and floods, making people lose houses and starve, making Tokyo unable to function politically,
economically, and socially, and thus making the world economy negatively affected; the end of the
era of
Japan as economic giant.<br>
<b>Potential Goal: </b>coordinated research and funding primarily by Japanese governments and
experts, but also jointly by other governments and experts from other parts of the world; planning
by
Japanese government to move some parts of governmental functions away from Tokyo; planning
by
governments to store necessary foodstuffs, clothes, medicines, medical equipment, etc., for the
worst
case scenario.<br>

89. <b>Summary: </b>Key opinion shapers or leaders making light of the risk of global climate
change;
the existence of uncertainty is being widely interpreted as meaning that there will be little or no
effect.<br>
<b>Development: </b>Key opinion shapers (in government and industry) are making light of the
risk of
global climate change because there are uncertainties. The eventual situation could well be more
serious
than projected, whereas the existence of some uncertainty is being widely interpreted as meaning
that
there will be little or no effect.  In some circles this interpretation is labeled "junk science", a
pejorative,
but not totally unwarranted term.  The result is that many policy makers are either confused or
have a
lessened concern than they should in the face of a major potential global problem.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Widespread and relatively sudden changes to the global climate
will
have serious  and mostly adverse effects on the economy, on human health, on the planetary
environment
and on the quality of life.<br>
<b>Goal:</b>  Persuade policy makers that the uncertainty surrounding potential global climate
change
does not mean the effects will be negligible or manageable.  <br>

105. <b>Summary: </b>Environmental security becoming an important concern in foreign policy.
<br>
<b>Development: </b>Secretary Christopher announced that this issue would be a focus of the
US
Department of State, but no agency has a clear policy about how to handle environmental issues
overseas
that may impinge on US interests.<br>
<b>Potential Consequences: </b> Some soul searching as the roles for various agencies shake
out.
Internationalization of currently national environmental issues. A new source of friction or
cooperation.<br>
