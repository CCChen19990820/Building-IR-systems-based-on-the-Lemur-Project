<h3 align="center"><strong>SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS</strong> </h3>
<h3 align="center"><strong>TO RULES FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE
MANAGEMENT</strong> </h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>PURPOSE:</strong> The
Environmental Protection Division (EPD) recognizes that the
person(s) subject to the various environmental laws that it
administers can be best served by minimizing or eliminating the
opportunities for dual regulation by the EPD and the federal
United States Environmental Protection Agency. The Georgia
General Assembly has enacted the Georgia Hazardous Waste
Management Act, which has been determined to be equivalent to the
federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976.
The objective of the Rules for Hazardous Waste Management is to
protect human health and the environment from the deleterious
effects of hazardous waste. With the statutory authority in
place, EPD has routinely applied for, obtained, and currently
maintains delegation of the federal hazardous waste program and
its companion rules. Once a year, EPD prepares a rule package for
the Board of Natural Resources that includes all federal
regulations promulgated between July 1 of the previous year and
June 30 of the current year for adoption at one of the Board's
fall meetings. This rule package contains all relevant federal
regulations from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996, and, in this
case, a federal regulation dated August 26, 1996. In addition, it
includes a non-federal rule which will provide management
standards for waste mercury-containing lamps. If the Board adopts
this rule package as EPD recommends, EPD will be able to continue
receiving delegation of authority from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, which in turn will minimize
persons subject to the federal RCRA law from having to
demonstrate compliance to both the state and federal governments,
concurrently. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p><strong>2. MAIN FEATURES:</strong> This rule package contains
new rules, technical corrections, amendments and/or modifications
to federal rules for EPD to maintain its delegation of authority
to run the hazardous waste program in lieu of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, this package
contains a non-federal rule governing the management of waste
mercury-containing lamps. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>
<p><strong>3. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXISTING RULES AND THE
PROPOSED RULES:</strong> The proposed new rules and amendments to
the existing rules are to be inserted into the Rules of the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection
Division (Chapter 391-3-11) Hazardous Waste Management. Changes
to existing federal rules, which have historically been adopted
by reference and the new non-federal rule for the management of
waste mercury-containing lamps, do not significantly change the
focus of the existing rules to provide safe management of
hazardous waste to protect human health and the environment. <br

ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT &quot;A-1.&quot;</strong> <br wp="br1">

<p> The primary responsibility of the Statistics program is
collecting, compiling and distributing information on Georgia's
commercial fisheries. This is accomplished by regularly obtaining
landings data from commercial seafood buyers and dealers,
particularly from the six coastal counties of Chatham, Bryan,
Liberty, McIntosh, Glynn and Camden. The data collected from
these dealers includes species landed, pounds, value, date
landed, gear type used, vessel name or number, area fished, and
days fished. This information is then available to DNR and
federal biologists who use it to make management decisions
regarding Georgia's fisheries. Data are also available to other
scientists, the academic community, media, and the general
public. Because a strict confidentiality policy is observed to
protect the privacy of seafood dealers, some information may only
be available in summary form. </p>

<p> The Statistics program is also responsible for sampling the
catches of vessels participating in the federal snapper-grouper
fishery. The catches are sampled for species composition, length,
weight, and effort. As studies warrant, soft tissue and hard part
samples are take from fish and forwarded to the interested party.</p>

<h1> Organizational History </h1>

<h2>Coastal Resources Division, Georgia Dept. of Natural
Resources</h2>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> The Georgia Board of Natural Resources authorized the
creation of Coastal Resources Division (CRD) in 1978. CRD was
created by combining the Coastal Fisheries Office of the former
Game and Fish Division and the Coastal Marshlands Protection
Agency. The purpose of creating Coastal Resources Division was to
more effectively and efficiently manage the Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) activities in one of the states' most vital and
sensitive areas -- the Georgia coast. At the time CRD was
created, it was the fourth DNR division and the only one
headquartered outside of Atlanta.</p>

<p> The Coastal Fisheries Office of the State Game and Fish
Commission was created in 1943 through an amendment to the State
Constitution. This amendment abolished the Division of Wildlife
and established the State Game and Fish Commission and created
the position of Director and Supervisor of Coastal Fisheries. The
Coastal Marshlands Protection Agency was created in 1970 with
passage of the Coastal Marshland Protection Act.</p>

<p> In its early days, the Coastal Fisheries Office was primarily
an enforcement agency, although some management-related
activities were performed by enforcement officers such as
checking the count-size of shrimp in Georgia's sounds and
nearshore ocean waters. In 1964, Congress passed the Commercial
Fisheries Research and Development Act (Public Law 88-309),
making Georgia eligible for federal funds to support commercial
fisheries management activities. At its peak, the Commercial
Fisheries Research and Development Act provided Georgia $104,000
annually. The law has since been repealed and funds are no longer
available.</p>

<p> The Georgia General Assembly passed the Coastal Marshlands
Protection Act in 1970 under the threat of phosphate mining in
Georgia's sensitive and valuable coastal marshlands. The law
created a permitting authority - the Coastal Marshlands
Protection Committee (CMPC) - to evaluate applications for
marshland alterations and authorized the hiring of an Executive
Director. The Executive Director was officed on Sapelo Island.
Monthly meetings of the CMPC were held to evaluate applicable
projects.</p>

<p> Georgia is blessed with over 2,344 linear miles of coastline
that is enriched with abundant marshes, barrier islands, beaches,
river corridors, maritime forests, and productive uplands.
Compared to other coastal states, the Georgia coast has been
relatively undeveloped or developed at a low density, due largely
to the fact that many of Georgia's barrier islands are not easily
accessible and much of the available developable land is
currently being managed for timber production. However, pressures
from increasing population and development are threatening the
quality of life on the coast. The population is growing at an
average rate of 20% every 10 years, although some coastal
counties in Georgia are experiencing much faster growth rates.</p>

<p> Coastal Georgia is protected from the sea by a chain of 14
barrier islands, stretching over a distance of 100 miles from
northernmost Tybee Island near the South Carolina border south to
Cumberland Island near the Florida border. These islands buffer
the marshes and mainland from the forces of the Atlantic Ocean.
Georgia's barrier islands have built up over the past 40,000
years due to shifting sand and rising sea levels, creating over
94 miles of beachfront.</p>

<p> Inland from the barrier islands, a broad band of coastal
marshlands separates the barriers from the mainland and covers an
area of almost 380,000 acres. Measuring three to five miles wide
in some places, these Georgia marshes constitute one-third of the
remaining salt marsh along the Atlantic Coast of the United
States. Georgia's marshes represent one of the most productive
habitat areas in the world, supporting vast numbers of fish,
crustaceans, birds, and other wildlife.</p>

<p> Several major rivers, including the second largest watershed

fresh and brackish water species, including the endangered
largemouth bass, shortnose sturgeon, West Indian Manatee, and
many others. All of Georgia's rivers carry large amounts of sand
and other sediments to the sea, helping to build new land and to

Shore Protection Act. Marine fisheries resources are managed
under a number of Georgia Title 27 laws as well as regulations of
the Board of Natural Resources. In 1992, CRD was assigned
management responsibility associated with the Protection of
Tidewaters Act and the Right of Passage Act to permit and
ultimately remove riverhouses from the Altamaha and other coastal
rivers.</p>

<h1> Organizational History </h1>

<h2>Coastal Resources Division, Georgia Dept. of Natural
Resources</h2>

<p><img src="art/blue_marble.gif"></p>

<p> The Georgia Board of Natural Resources authorized the
creation of Coastal Resources Division (CRD) in 1978. CRD was
created by combining the Coastal Fisheries Office of the former
Game and Fish Division and the Coastal Marshlands Protection
Agency. The purpose of creating Coastal Resources Division was to
more effectively and efficiently manage the Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) activities in one of the states' most vital and
sensitive areas -- the Georgia coast. At the time CRD was
created, it was the fourth DNR division and the only one
headquartered outside of Atlanta.</p>

<p> The Coastal Fisheries Office of the State Game and Fish
Commission was created in 1943 through an amendment to the State
Constitution. This amendment abolished the Division of Wildlife
and established the State Game and Fish Commission and created
the position of Director and Supervisor of Coastal Fisheries. The
Coastal Marshlands Protection Agency was created in 1970 with
passage of the Coastal Marshland Protection Act.</p>

<p> In its early days, the Coastal Fisheries Office was primarily
an enforcement agency, although some management-related
activities were performed by enforcement officers such as
checking the count-size of shrimp in Georgia's sounds and
nearshore ocean waters. In 1964, Congress passed the Commercial
Fisheries Research and Development Act (Public Law 88-309),
making Georgia eligible for federal funds to support commercial
fisheries management activities. At its peak, the Commercial
Fisheries Research and Development Act provided Georgia $104,000
annually. The law has since been repealed and funds are no longer
available.</p>

<p> The Georgia General Assembly passed the Coastal Marshlands
Protection Act in 1970 under the threat of phosphate mining in
Georgia's sensitive and valuable coastal marshlands. The law
created a permitting authority - the Coastal Marshlands
Protection Committee (CMPC) - to evaluate applications for
marshland alterations and authorized the hiring of an Executive
Director. The Executive Director was officed on Sapelo Island.
Monthly meetings of the CMPC were held to evaluate applicable
projects.</p>

<p> Georgia is blessed with over 2,344 linear miles of coastline
that is enriched with abundant marshes, barrier islands, beaches,
river corridors, maritime forests, and productive uplands.
Compared to other coastal states, the Georgia coast has been
relatively undeveloped or developed at a low density, due largely
to the fact that many of Georgia's barrier islands are not easily
accessible and much of the available developable land is
currently being managed for timber production. However, pressures
from increasing population and development are threatening the
quality of life on the coast. The population is growing at an
average rate of 20% every 10 years, although some coastal
counties in Georgia are experiencing much faster growth rates.</p>

<p> Coastal Georgia is protected from the sea by a chain of 14
barrier islands, stretching over a distance of 100 miles from
northernmost Tybee Island near the South Carolina border south to
Cumberland Island near the Florida border. These islands buffer
the marshes and mainland from the forces of the Atlantic Ocean.
Georgia's barrier islands have built up over the past 40,000
years due to shifting sand and rising sea levels, creating over
94 miles of beachfront.</p>

<p> Inland from the barrier islands, a broad band of coastal
marshlands separates the barriers from the mainland and covers an
area of almost 380,000 acres. Measuring three to five miles wide
in some places, these Georgia marshes constitute one-third of the
remaining salt marsh along the Atlantic Coast of the United
States. Georgia's marshes represent one of the most productive
habitat areas in the world, supporting vast numbers of fish,
crustaceans, birds, and other wildlife.</p>

<p> Several major rivers, including the second largest watershed
on the east coast of the U.S. - - the Altamaha River -- traverse
Georgia's coastal plain on their way to the Allantic Ocean. Most
of these rivers provide critical habitat for large numbers of
fresh and brackish water species, including the endangered
largemouth bass, shortnose sturgeon, West Indian Manatee, and
many others. All of Georgia's rivers carry large amounts of sand
and other sediments to the sea, helping to build new land and to
keep up with sea level rise over time.</p>

<p> Coastal Resources Division is responsible for managing
Georgia's 380,000 acres of coastal marshlands, 94 miles of
beaches, diverse marine fisheries resources, and riverhouses.
Georgia's marshes and beaches are managed through permitting
programs established by the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act and
Shore Protection Act. Marine fisheries resources are managed
under a number of Georgia Title 27 laws as well as regulations of
the Board of Natural Resources. In 1992, CRD was assigned
management responsibility associated with the Protection of
Tidewaters Act and the Right of Passage Act to permit and
ultimately remove riverhouses from the Altamaha and other coastal
rivers.</p>

<!--A Brief Introduction of the Book Store-->
<P> Buteo Books was founded in 1971 by Joyce and Byron Harrell in Vermillion, South Dakota.  List No. 1, on a single sheet of paper, offered some 50 birds books for sale.  In 1991 the business was purchased by Allen Hale and moved to Shipman, Virginia.  Four Buteo Books catalogs issued in 1994 offered over 2000 titles in ornithology.  We offer toll free ordering and personal service from our small, but knowledgeable staff.  A wide range of shipping options is available to destinations worldwide.</P>

<H2>The Law of Cyberspace</h2>
<TABLE align="JUSTIFY" units=relative colspec="C,C,C" width=600>
<TR valign=top><TD><STRONG>by David R. Ellis, Esq., Largo</STRONG><p>
The Internet!  Computer networks and online systems!  Today, we
find a dizzying array of new technologies that are accessible
to anyone with a computer, a modem, and a telephone.  As more
and more Americans are plugging into the infrastructure of the
&quot;New Information Age&quot;, they encounter a variety of issues
in &quot;cyberspace&quot; that have an impact on society, culture
and our legal system.
<P>
What are some of the legal issues in the online world?  The law
is developing at a rapid rate to embrace many traditional areas
of law and apply these legal concepts to cyberspace.  These include
issues of privacy, defamation and obscenity, intellectual property
law, and crime.  Many of these issues are being considered by
Congress, state legislatures, government commissions, and private
groups.  For the first time we find cases coming to the courts
and decisions being rendered by judges and juries.
<P>
One of the significant concerns about the online world is the
threat of invasion of privacy through unauthorized access to data
on individuals that are available on the nets.  As early as the
1960s, Congress considered proposals for a National Data Bank
that would have coordinated all kinds of information about individuals
and businesses that had been gathered by the federal government.
 the outcry at the time was so great that the proposal was shelved.
 Since then, Congress has passed the electronic Communications
Privacy Act and other laws to address threats to individual privacy.

  
</TD>
<TD>
Another important area of concern is the protection of intellectual
property.  Recently, the Working Group on Intellectual Property
Rights of the Task Force Information Infrastructure, a federally
supported commission, published a report addressing these issues.
 Entitled &quot;Intellectual Property and the National Information
Infrastructure&quot;, the report discusses copyrights, patents,
trademarks and trade secrets, technology issues such as user access
and security, and makes recommendations for future legislation
and regulation.  One important need is to review and update the
Copyright Act to make sure it covers new technology.  There are
trademark issues such as who owns rights in Internet Domain names.
Other issues of interest include the potential liability of operators
of electronic bulletin boards and web sites for messages and material
placed on their bulletin boards that are defamatory or obscene,
or that infringe copyrights or trademarks.  Cases involving Prodigy
and Playboy have tested some of these issues and have produced
precedents in the courts.
<P>
Finally, a host of potential criminal issues surround the Internet
and other online technologies.  These include online technologies.
 These include access to network and data, denial of passwords,
Tampering with data, introducing, works and viruses into networks,
and running criminal enterprises such as drug dealing, money laundering,
and pornography.  Federal, state and local governments have passed
a variety of laws over the years to govern electronic and computer
crime, but these laws have to be constantly reviewed and updated
to key up with current technology.
</TD>

<TD>
Florida's computer crime statute,
Chapter 812, Fla. Stats., for example, was enacted in 1978 and
has not been amended since.  IN addition, law enforcement officials
are often far behind the technology and need to be frequently
updated to the current state of the art in order to understand
the technology and prosecute those who misuse it.
<P>
The law of cyberspace promises to be a rapidly growing area of
the law in the years ahead.  Developments in the technology will
keep all of those involved in the field alert to needed changes
in the law to allow for innovation while protecting the rights
of individuals in our society.

	Catalonia in association with BirdLife International (formerly ICBP), previous 
	volumes of the Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) have met with 
	critical acclaim. The family chapters make fascinating reading, the photographs are 
	excellent and informative (the photo captions alone are succinct lessons in avian 
	biology), and the plates show every species.  
	
	<P>HBW is to be completed in twelve (12) volumes, Volume 4: Sandgrouse to

	announced.

<P>	A. POOLE AND F. GILL, Editors

			<P>The Academy, in partnership with the American 
		Ornithologists' Union, has undertaken the publication of species 
		accounts for each of the more than 700 species which breed in the 
		United States and Canada. The illustrated accounts provide 
		comprehensive summaries of the current knowledge of the species 
		treated with range maps and an extensive list of references.  By special
		arrangement with the publishers, Buteo Books is pleased to offer single
		species accounts separately at <B>$7.50</B> each. The first 240 accounts
		are listed in taxonomic order below. The item number is the unique number
		for that species account; accounts are numbered in order of publication.
		The goal of the project is to publish eighty accounts per year. Buteo Books
		will stock new accounts as they are issued.

The titles in the above catagories are new books listed alphabetically by author within subject categories and, for the most part, represent books in print.  Price is for the cloth (hardback) edition unless indicated otherwise.  Buteo Books makes every effort to keep these titles in stock, but both price and availability are subject to change.  Titles preceded by an asterisk (*) are new to the annual catalog.

CALL ON BUTEO BOOKS</B></CENTER></P>
<P>

	Having just compiled this catalog, I realize the difficulty you, the reader, might encounter in trying to find and select the book most suited to your purpose. Because of the large number of books listed, commentary is limited and a bare minimum of information is provided for most titles. We welcome your telephone calls and are familiar with most of the books on our shelves. We will be happy to provide you with additional information and make recommendations as appropriate. Our inventory of titles in ornithology is unmatched and we try to provide excellent personal service to go with it.
	Buteo Books occupies a large portion of our rural residence in the Piedmont woodland of Nelson County between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the James River. Should you be in Central Virginia, feel free to pay us a visit.  Call ahead of time for directions and to make sure someone will be here. 
</P>
<P><CENTER><B>CATALOGS</B></CENTER></P>
<P>

	Each year we issue an annual catalog of ornithology books of which this is an example. An additional 2-3 smaller catalogs are issued containing rare, used, and out-of-print books; a section of new and forthcoming books is included. The cost of preparing, printing, and mailing catalogs is significant, so please advise us of address changes. Call us if you no longer  wish to receive our catalogs.  
</P>
<P><CENTER><B>WE BUY BOOKS</B></CENTER></P>
<P>

	We have a large stock of used, out-of-print, and rare titles in ornithology available for our customers. Because of the steady demand for such books, we are able to pay competitive prices for single important volumes or entire collections in ornithology.  Feel free to call or write if you have books you wish to sell or trade.

<HR>
<P>     Initially, it was our plan to list titles in this section in taxonomic sequence, but this proved to be awkward and time consuming. What we have done is to list titles alphabetically by author within taxonomic groups of various sizes. Reference should be made to the geographic headings and the general ornithology section where other titles may include additional information on individual species.</P>

Catalog No. 14 contains a selection of rare and out-of-print titles
in ornithology. A number of <B>falconry</B> titles are also being
offered. Most of the books are one-of-a-kind; reserving books
by telephone is recommended. Every effort has been made to describe
the books accurately, but don't hesitate to call or write if you
have any questions. Books will be held for ten days pending receipt
of your payment. We have many titles not listed in the catalog
and actively search for out-of-print books in the field of ornithology.
<BR>
<P>
Our main 1996 catalog of ornithology books is still available
on request. You may call or write for a list of the species accounts
currently available in the <I><B>Birds of North America</B></I>
series. Buteo Books continues to stock the most extensive selection
of new and out of print bird books to be found in the Americas.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Because of the continued demand for rare and out-of-print bird
books, we are able to pay top prices for single important volumes
or entire collections. Call or write Buteo Books if you have books
you wish to sell or trade.<BR>

Are you intimidated by large wine lists, snooty waiters or "wine snobs?"

Jancis Robinson's Wine Course introduces you to wine and helps de-mystify the

subject for everyone who enjoys wine.</b></font><br><br>



As someone who gets paid for drinking fine wine, Jancis Robinson cannot

believe her luck. Editor of the award-winning best-seller "The Oxford

Companion to Wine", and wine columnist for "The Financial Times" and the

"Wine Spectator," Jancis enjoys an international reputation as a writer and

expert.  She is one of only 194 "Masters of Wine" and the sole British

journalist to pass the notoriously difficult exam.  She brings great humor

and the expertise of a Master of Wine to one of life's most delicious

subjects.<br><br>



For information on matching food and wine, check out the <a href="chart1.html">

"Wine and Food Charts."</a> <br><br>



To learn more about how to read specific wine labels and what the best years

for wine are, check out the <a href="region.html">"Wine by Region"</a> section 

which offers tips on

understanding labels, vintage guides and maps of different wine regions.<br><br>

<center><h2>A bluffer's guide to wine-making and vine-growing jargon</h2></center>





<b>acidity</b> is what gives wine, and most other drinks, its tang.

Lemons have lots of it; potatoes very little. A wine's <b>acidity</b>

comes from the acids (mainly <a href="#malic">malic</a> and <a href="#tartaric">tartaric</a>) in grape juice. which

diminish as grapes ripen. A hot summer may reduce acids to such an

extent that some have to be added, a process known as

<b>acidification.</b>

<b><a name="antho">anthocyans</a>,</b> <a href="#phenolics">phenolics</a> which most strongly influence a red wine's

colour, which is directly affected by its <a href="#pH">pH.</a>

<br><br>

<b>ascorbic acid,</b> or Vitamin C, is often added to <a href="#must">must</a> during

<a href="#sulphur">sulphur</a> dioxide to keep white wines fresh.

<br><br>

<b><a name="barrel">barrel</a>,</b> the winemaker's most fashionable tool. barrel ageing or

barrel maturation -keeping a wine in cask between fermentation and

bottling so that it stabilises naturally in the presence of small

amounts of air and also absorbs some flavour and possibly tannins from

the wood, depending on its age and size, and duration of barrel ageing.

rot' responsible for great sweet wines) or simply spoiling them with

mould, depending on conditions.

therefore grape ripeness) or <a href="#must">must</a> common in the US.

<br><br>

<b>canopy</b> - the above-ground parts of the vine, especially its

leaves

<br><br>

<b>canopy management</b> - viticultural techniques designed to

manipulate the canopy to achieve a specific end, usually optimising the

quantity of grapes and quality of wine

<br><br>

<b>cap</b> - thick cake of grape skins floating on top of a vat of

fermenting red wine.

<br><br>

<b><a name="carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a></b> is the harmless gas given off during fermentation

and that responsible for the bubbles in all fizzy drinks, including

sparkling and slightly gassy wine.

<br><br>

<b>carbonic maceration,</b> special way of making fruity, early-maturing

red wines, most notably Beaujolais, by fermenting them in a sealed vat

filled with <a href="#carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. 

<br><br>

<b><a name="chap">chaptalization,</a></b> common cool climate winemaking procedure which

compensates for underripe grapes by adding sugar to the fermentation vat

in order to produce a more alcoholic wine. Named after French statesman

Jean Antoine Chaptal and usually strictly controlled.

<br><br>

<b><a name="cgrowth">classed growth,</a> classified growth,</b> Anglicisation of cru class&#233;.

term used in Bordeaux for the 60 or so wine estates, or crus, that were

included in the 1855 classification of top MÈdoc and Graves properties.

They were ranked, as in football divisions, into first (premier), second

(deuxi&#232;me), third (troisi&#232;me), fourth (quatri&#232;me) and fifth (cinqi&#232;me)

growths. There are only five first growths: Chx Lafite, Latour, Mouton,

Margaux and Haut-Brion.

<br><br>

<b><a name="clar">clarification,</a></b> umbrella term for a host of processes designed to

ensure wine is crystal clear, including <a href="#fining">fining</a>,

<br><br>

<b>clone</b> - an example of a variety replicated from a particular

mother vine specially selected for a particular attribute(s). 

<br><br>

<b>concentration,</b> new technique for concentrating flavour (and <a href="#acid">acid</a>

and <a href="#tanin">tannin</a>) in less ripe vintages.

<br><br>

<b>coulure</b> - deficient fruit set which may substantially reduce the

size of that year's crop. Just after flowering, an excessive proportion

of the nascent berries fall off, often because of unsettled cold, wet

weather. Some varieties are more prone than others.

<br><br>

<b>cultivar</b> - South African term for vine or grape variety

<br><br>

<b>crossing</b> - variety bred from members of the same species

<br><br>

<b>cru class&#233;,</b> French for <a href="#cgrowth">classed growth</a>

<br><br>

<b>downy mildew</b> - fungal vine disease.

<br><br>

<b>&#233;levage,</b> French term with no direct English equivalent for the

wine-maturing processes involved between fermentation and bottling.

<br><br>

<b>enology,</b> US spelling of oenology.

<br><br>

<b>ethyl alcohol,</b> or ethanol, is the sort of <a href="#alcohol">alcohol</a> found in

alcoholic drinks such as wine.

<br><br>

<b>fanleaf</b> - virus vine disease. 

<br><br>

<b><a name="ferm">fermentation</a></b> - the process whereby sweet grape juice is

transformed into alcoholic wine, thanks to the action of <a href="#yeast">yeast</a>

<br><br>

<b>field grafting</b> - grafting a new variety on to an established   

rootstock in the vineyard. Increasingly common.

<br><br>

<b><a name="filtration">filtration</a>,</b> controversial <a href="#clar">clarification</a> 

process of pumping wine through various different sorts of filter to remove suspended solids. It

may also strip out flavour if overdone.

<br><br>

<b><a name="fining">fining</a>,</b> <a href="#clar">clarification</a> technique 

involving adding a fining agent

(such as egg whites or bentonite) which attracts solids to fall to the

bottom of a container.

<br><br>

<b><a name="flavour">flavour compounds</a>,</b> complex, still under-explored maze of

<a href="#phenolics">phenolics</a> responsible for the flavours of different wines.

<br><br>

<b>foxy</b> - distinctive taste of the grapes and wine of some American

vines, especially Vitis labrusca and some of its hybrids. Methyl

anthranilate is the (often) offending compound.

<br><br>

<b>free-run</b> is the name given to the juice or wine which flows

without pressing.

<br><br>

<b>French hybrid</b> - vine variety bred from American and European

parents

<br><br>

<b>fruit set</b> - early summer phenomenon which immediately follows

flowering. As soon as the vine flowers, a proportion of them are

fertilized, or 'set', to become berries, and eventually grapes. The

higher the proportion, the bigger the crop is likely to be.

<br><br>

<b>grafting</b> - broadly, inserting a section of one plant into another

so that they unite and grow as one plant. In a viticultural context,

usually grafting a European fruiting vine on to a rootstock, often

chosen for its resistance to phylloxera    .

<a href="#oxidation">oxidation</a>.

<br><br>

<b>leafroll</b> - virus disease of the vine

<br><br>

<b><a name="lees">lees</a></b> are the solids left at the bottom of a fermentation vat

after fermentation. Relatively neutral-tasting white wines are often

deliberately given prolonged <b>lees contact</b> and even <b>lees

stirring</b> to generate more flavour and make them more stable.

<br><br>

<b><a name="malic">malic</a> acid,</b> the sharp, appley acid most notable in grapes from

cool years.

<br><br>

<b>malolactic fermentation (MLF or 'le malo'),</b> increasingly common

second fermentation in which harsh malic <a href="#acid">acid</a> is converted to softer,

lactic (milky) acid making the resulting wine is more supple.

<br><br>

<b><a name="merc">mercaptans,</a></b> wine fault popular with Australian tasters. A skunky

smell results from <a href="#yeast">yeast</a> reacting with the <a href="#lees">lees</a>. 

It can be cured by assiduous <a href="#racking">racking</a>.

<br><br>

<b>millerandage</b> - abnormal fruit set in which bunches contain

berries of very different sizes because of poor fertilisation, often

because of unfavourable weather.

<br><br>

<b><a name="must">must</a>,</b> useful word for the pulpy mass at any stage between grape

juice and wine.

<br><br>

<b>must weight</b> - measure of grape ripeness, or sugar concentration

<b>Oechsle,</b> measure of sugar concentration in grape juice (and

therefore grape ripeness) or <a href="#must">must</a> common in Germany.

<br><br>

<b>oenology</b> is the science of winemaking, practised by a (usually

qualified) <b>oenologist.</b>

<br><br>

<b><a name="oxidation">oxidation</a>,</b> potentially serious calamity that can strike grapes,

grape juice and wine if they are over-exposed to <a href="#oxy">oxygen</a>,

making them go brown (like a cut apple) and taste flat. Wines suffering

from oxidation, sometimes from a less-than-airtight stopper, are

<b>oxidized. </b>

<br><br>

<b><a name="oxy">oxygen</a>,</b> both good and bad fairy in the winemaking process. A

small amount of oxygen at the beginning of fermentation encourages the

<a href="#yeast">yeast</a> and during barrel maturation deepens colour, smooths flavour and

makes the wine more stable. But too much oxygen causes <a href="#oxidation">oxidation</a> and

may eventually turn the wine to vinegar.

<br><br>

<b><a name="pH">pH.</a></b> All but the most technically-minded should skip this

explanation of one of the wine bore's buzz words. pH is a measure of the

concentration of <a href="#acid">acidity</a> in a liquid but higher readings mean lower

acid. Water, for example, has a pH of 7 while most wines have a pH of

between 3 and 4 with very acidic wines having a pH of less than 3. pH

and colour are also closely related. 

<br><br>

<b><a name="phenolics">phenolics,</a></b> varied group of compounds found mainly in skins, stems

and seeds in the case of grapes. They include <a href="#antho">anthocyans</a>, <a href="#tanin">tannins</a> and

many <a href="#flavour">flavour</a> compounds. Precipitated, they form an important part of

wine's sediment and play a considerable role in wine ageing. Red wines

are much higher in phenolics than white, which is why red wine is better

at protecting against heart disease.

<br><br>

<b>phylloxera</b> - fatal vine pest which chews vine roots. The only

remedy is to replant on phylloxera-resistant rootstocks.

<br><br>

<b>potential alcohol</b> of a liquid is the acoholic strength it would

reach if all the <a href="#sugar">sugar</a> were fermented into <a href="#alcohol">alcohol</a>.

<br><br>

<b>powdery mildew</b> - fungal disease of the vine.

<br><br>

<b>pressing,</b> important winemaking operation involving literally

pressing the juice (white wines) or astringent <b>press wine</b> out of

the skins. The quality of the resulting juice depends on how hard the

grapes are pressed (as explained on p 67). 

<br><br>

<b>protective winemaking</b> involves protecting the grapes, juice,

<a href="#must">must</a> and wine from <a href="#oxy">oxygen</a>, 

typically by using sealed containers, low

temperatures, <a href="#sulphur">sulphur</a> dioxide and sometimes ascorbic 

<a href="#acid">acid</a>.

<br><br>

<b>pruning</b> - arguably the most important operation of the vineyard

year in terms of wine quality. During winter the vine is cut back

leaving a specific number of buds responsible for producing the next

year's crop. Although many other factors come into play, low-yielding

vines in general tend to produce more concentrated wine.

<br><br>

<b>pulp</b> - the fleshy part of the grape containing most of the water,

sugars and acids in grape juice. Apart from red fleshed  Teinturiers,

the flesh of all grapes is the same dull grey, no matter what the colour

of the grape's skin. 

<br><br>

<b><a name="racking">racking</a></b> is the operation of transferring wine from one container

(typically a barrel) to another, leaving behind the <a href="#lees">lees</a>. It can

usefully expose the wine to oxygen and avoid <a href="#reduc">reduction</a>.

<br><br>

<b>residual sugar</b> (RS), the amount of unfermented <a href="#sugar">sugar</a> left in a

wine after fermentation is complete, usually measured in grams per litre

(g/l) or per cent. A residual sugar level of less than 2 g/l (0.02 per

cent) is imperceptible to most palates. Although <a href="#acid">acidity</a>

counterbalances residual sugar, most wines with 25 g/l (2.5 per cent)

residual sugar taste distinctly sweet.

<br><br>

<b><a name="reduc">reducing conditions</a></b> are those which favour reduction, or losing

<a href="#oxy">oxygen</a>, the opposite of <a href="#oxidation">oxidation</a>. In excess, where a (usually red)

wine is starved of oxygen, they can result in off-putting <a href="#merc">mercaptan</a> or

<a href="#sulphides">sulphide</a> smells.

rootstock - plant specially selected to form the root system of a

fruiting vine of another variety by grafting     

<br><br>

<b>seed</b> - part of the grape containing tannins. Care is usually

taken not to crush them.

<br><br>

<b>skin</b> - very important part of the grape which contains most

flavour compounds, pigments, and tannins - all highly desirable, not to

say essential, for red wines but a more debatable ingredient in the

white winemaking process

<br><br>

<b>skin contact,</b> deliberate policy of trying to extract as many

<a href="#flavour">flavour</a> compounds and/or <a href="#antho">anthocyans</a> as possible from grape skins into

juice (in the case of white wines) or wine (in the case of reds).

<br><br>

<b>sorbic acid,</b> additive widely used in the food and drink

industries to stun <a href="#yeast">yeasts</a> and moulds. Sometimes used for inexpensive

sweet wines, it smells of crushed geranium leaves, excessively to a

small proportion of particularly sensitive humans. 

<br><br>

<b>soutirage,</b> French for racking.

<br><br>

<b>stabilization,</b> umbrella term for all the winemaking operations

designed to stop wines developing a fault in bottle such as a haze,

cloud or fizz, no matter what the storage conditions. It is practised

most brutally on everyday wines.

<br><br>

<b>stem/stalk</b> - woody attachment of grape to bunch, high in often

harsh tannins. All or most are usually deliberately eliminated by a

mechanical destemmer prior to fermentation.  

<br><br>

<b>sulfur,</b> alternative spelling of sulphur.

<br><br>

<b><a name="sulphides">sulphides,</a></b> off smells reminiscent of bad eggs which can taint

heavily <a href="#reduc">reduced</a> wine.

<br><br>

<b><a name="sulphur">sulphur dioxide</a>,</b> the most common and most useful winemaking

additive used since Roman times, used mainly as a preservative,

disinfectant and to ward off <a href="#oxidation">oxidation</a>. Its use has been declining as

consumers have become less tolerant of the freshly-struck match smell

associated with sulphur. Some asthmatics also react badly to high doses

of sulphur, which has lead to some countries' requiring the legend

'contains <b>sulfites/sulphites'</b> on wine labels. A tiny but

increasing proportion of wines are made using no sulphur at all but they

tend to be more fragile than most. Sulphur reacts readily with many

other wine ingredients to form <b>bound sulphur;</b> it is only <b>free

sulphur</b>  which can be detected, although sensitivities vary

considerably between individuals.

<br><br>

<b><a name="sugar">sugar</a></b> - carbohydrates accumulated in the grape pulp during the

ripening process which are transformed into alcohol by     fermentation.

See also <a href="#chap">chaptalization.</a>    

<br><br>

<b>sur lie,</b> French for a wine treated to <a href="#lees">lees</a> contact.

<br><br>

<b><a name="tanin">tannins</a></b> - cheek-drying, astringent phenolic compounds similar to

stewed tea in effect on the palate which are found mainly in red wine

and are derived from grape seeds, skins, and stems. They can help

preserve red wines while they mature in bottle. Tannin management is one

of the red winemaker's most important jobs. 

<br><br>

<b><a name="tartaric">tartaric</a> acid,</b> the most common and distinctive wine 

<a name="acid">acid</a> which

is a particularly good preservative. A lot of the acid is precipitated

as crusty desposits called <b>tartrates,</b> usually seen as harmless

white crystals in white wine, and dyed deep red in red wines.

<br><br>

<b>topping up,</b> cellar operation of filling barrels regularly to

avoid <a href="#oxidation">oxidation</a>.

<br><br>

<b>training</b> - shaping a vine into a specific shape, usually to

effect some form of canopy management    

<br><br>

<b>triage,</b> French word for sorting, typically grapes for health and

quality in the vineyard or as they are brought in to the winery.

<br><br>

<b>ullage</b> is the head space between wine and the top of a container

such as a barrel or bottle. If it is excessive it can cause <a href="#oxidation">oxidation</a>.

<br><br>

<b>vieilles vignes</b> - French for 'old vines', which generally produce

more concentrated wine than young ones.

<br><br>

<b>vigour</b> - a vine's natural tendency to sprout forth leaves. 

<br><br>

<b>vine density</b> - important vineyard parameter, the number of vines

planted per unit of area

<br><br>

<b>vinifera</b> - vine species of European origin, as almost all the

well known wine producing varieties are. 

<br><br>

<b>vintage</b> - can mean either the particular year in which the crop

was harvested or the process of harvesting itself

<br><br>

<b>Vitis</b> - the vine genus. 

<br><br>

<b>whole bunch</b> pressing and fermentation - as opposed to destemming

before pressing or fermenting. These two techniques, common in Champagne

and Burgundy respectively, physically help drainage, the stems acting as

conduits.

<br><br>

<b><a name="yeast">yeast</a>,</b> micro-organisms of many types which can encourage all

sorts of chemical changes, including <a href="#ferm">fermentation.</a> Traditional wine

producers tend to rely on ambient, invisible yeasts  whereas modernists

prefer specially cultured yeasts chosen for their suitability for a

particular fermentation.

<br><br>

<b>yield</b> - the amount of wine or grapes produced per unit area,

usually measured either as ton/acre, tonnes/ha or, in much of Europe,

hl/ha. Many factors such as pressing regime, grape variety, and style of

wine affect the conversion of weight of grapes into volume of wine but 1

ton/acre is very approximately equivalent to 17.5 hl/ha.

<i>Italicized type</i>  denotes lighter years; normal type means average years; and <b>bold type</b> is used for exceptional years. <br><br>



<center><font size=+2><a name="BORDEAUX">BORDEAUX</a></font></center>
<font size=+1>Red</font><br>

1994	The best year since 1990, very ripe but September rains were a problem again.<br><br>

<i>1993	Another wet harvest.  Picked earlier, the Right Bank (of the Gironde) looks best.</i> <br><br>

<i>1992	Light, fruity, simple wines that need drinking soon.</i> <br><br>

<i>1991	The start of Bordeaux's run of bad luck.  Spring frosts of decimated Right Bank, the Medoc's not bad.</i> <br><br>

<b>1990	A second scorching year in a row.  Very ripe, concentrated wines at all levels, many outstanding.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	A hot summer and huge crop of rich, opulent, expensive wines, drinking astonishingly well young.</b><br><br>

1988	Overshadowed by 1989 and 1990.  'Classic' style i.e. firm and a bit austere.<br><br>

<i>1987	A middling year, simple, fruity and pleasant but unexciting.  Some attractive Pomerols.</i> <br><br>

1986	Dense, brooding and viciously tannic.  Some will be legendary but not for 10+ years.<br><br>

1985	Uniformly lovely, fragrant wines especially from Right Bank, most need drinking 	soon.<br><br>

1983	Good but less concentrated than 1982, so need drinking.  For once, Margaux excelled.<br><br>

<b>1982	Legendary year, horribly expensive but very concentrated and so delicious.</b><br><br>

1981	Patchy quality, but many crisp, appetizing Medocs for current consumption.<br><br>

1979	Graceful, suave and well-balanced, but drink up.<br><br>

1978	A perfect autumn saved the crop.  The big Left Bank names are strongest.<br><br>

1975	Frequently overwhelmed by dry tannins.  A few Pomerols and Pauillacs are huge and magnificent.<br><br>

1970	An excellent if slightly austere year in all areas.  Even lesser wines have survived.<br><br>

<font size=+1>Dry White<br><br>

1994	Potentially superb as fully ripe grapes were again gathered before the rains.<br><br>

1993	Avoided the rains:  generally good, soft and full, sometimes outstanding.<br><br>

1992	Clearly better than the reds, the best are intense and well structured.<br><br>

<i>1991	A difficult year, rather light and most are just too dilute to be interesting.</i> <br><br>

1990	Mostly richer, fuller and more complex than 1989, but drink now.<br><br>

1989	Picked too soon, generally light and not a patch on the reds except for Laville-and Haut-Brion.<br><br>

<font size=+1>Sweet whites<br><br>

1994	Grey rot in September, so choose the chateaux that could afford to be fussy.<br><br>

<i>1993	Another pretty dreadful autumn, hardly anyone made interesting wine.</i> <br><br>

<i>1992	Endless rains ruined the crop.  Many estates declassified everything.</i> <br><br>

1991	After the April frosts a tiny crop was eventually harvested, of not bad quality.<br><br>

<b>1990	Massive rich wines that may be underestimated but presently seem a shade less complex than 1989 and 1988.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	Huge, almost corpulent wines that are dramatic and exciting.</b><br><br>

<b>1988	Of the fabulous trio of vintages this shows most botrytis and elegance and may live longest.</b><br><br>

<b>1986	A very strong year, plenty of botrytis and beautifully balanced.</b><br><br>

1985	Rich and elegant but too little noble rot to add the magic.<br><br>

<b>1983	The best since 1976, with similar power and size.  Good value too!</b><br><br>

1982	Overlooked as a white vintage.  Limited botrytis but Suduiraut and Yquem were successful.<br><br>

1980	Much better than the reds, the top chateaux are delicious and affordable.<br><br>
<br>
<center><font size=+2><a name="BURGUNDY">BURGUNDY</a></font></center>
<font size=+1>Red</font><br><br>

1994	A year to highlight Burgundy's infamy for variability as too many let yields balloon after the rains.<br><br>

1993	Better than average:  healthy grapes and well-coloured, fruity, but quite tannic wines.<br><br>

<i>1992	Rain at the wrong time again.  Soft, tender wines to drink young.</i> <br><br>

1991	Grapes had ripened before it rained and some wines from the Cote de Nuits are excellent.<br><br>

<b>1990	A great success:  rich and fragrant.  The top vineyards are majestic.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	Nearly up to 1990, if not as intense.  These are charming now.</b><br><br>

1988	Tough and unusually backward, most are densely concentrated but need time.<br><br>

1987	Natural ripeness a problem, so many are overchaptalized.  Select from reliable growers.<br><br>

1986	A very tricky year of rain and rot.  Careful growers avoided the dilution.  Few worthy.<br><br>

<i>1985	A problem-free year:  delicious and fragrant young, but will they age?</i> <br><br>

1984	Poor weather and unripe grapes.  Best to avoid.<br><br>

1983	A torrid summer and very mixed bag.  A handful are brilliant but most are tainted by rot.<br><br>

1982	Large yields of soft, pleasant wines, now largely past it.<br><br>

1980	Underestimated at first:  balanced and scented, the best are still elegant.<br><br>

<b>1978	A late but uniformly good crop.  Top growers made breathtaking wines.  Now rare.</b><br><br>

<font size=+1>White</font><br><br>

1994	Generally better than the reds and certainly more consistent, especially the Maconnais.<br><br>

1993	A large, ripe harvest struck by rain, so concentration is a problem.<br><br>

1992	Balanced, elegant and refined:  best from the Cotes rather than Chablis.<br><br>

1991	Rain reduced acidity and concentration, some are delightful but many are dilute.<br><br>

1990	Very ripe but yields were just too high for profound wines.  Chablis best.<br><br>

<b>1989	A medium-sized crop produced spectacularly rich and horribly expensive wines.</b><br><br>

1988	Lean and austere, they may gain charm with age.  Good Chablis vintage.<br><br>

<b>1986	Not as consistent as 1985, but great from reliable growers.  Drink up.</b><br><br>

<b>1985	Beautifully balanced, expansive wines which are now gorgeous.</b><br><br>

1983	Huge and alcoholic, the few with acidity to balance are spectacular.<br><br><br>

<center><font size=+2><a name="ALSACE">ALSACE</a></font></center><br>

1994	September rain, but impressive wines from those brave enough to pick late.<br><br>

1993	A very good year:  ripe wines of weight and intensity.<br><br>

1992	Better than most French regions:  ripe, soft and forward.<br><br>

1991	A difficult year, rain hit the harvest and the wines are light and acidic.<br><br>

<b>1990	A third wonderful year of classic, powerful, long-lived wines.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	Massive sugar levels produced a blockbuster vintage with many thrilling botrytis-affected bottles.</b><br><br>

<b>1988	Superb and intensely flavoured with the balance to last.</b><br><br>

<b>1985	Beautiful and elegant, these have gained complexity with age.</b><br><br><br>

<center><font size=+2><a name="LANGUEDOC">LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON</a></font></center><br>

<b>1994	Probably France's most successful region:  a small crop of real richness and concentration.</b><br><br>

<b>1993	After a wonderful summer this is an exciting vintage.</b><br><br>

1992	Irregular quality inevitable after localized autumn downpours.  Whites better than reds.<br><br>

<b>1991	A really outstanding year of rich, dense and big-structured wines.</b><br><br>

1990	Generous weather gave excellent wines that are fruity and delicious now.<br><br><br>


<center><font size=+2><a name="NRHONE">NORTH RHONE</a></font></center><br>

1994	All-too familiar autumn rains before the fruit could ripen.  A few will surprise.<br><br>

<i>1993	A great summer then rain, hail and mildew, so light, soft wines are the rule, although Chapoutier surprise.</i> <br><br>

<i>1992	Heavy September rains gave a mixed bag of early-drinking wines.</i> <br><br>

1991	A good vintage, superb in Cote-Rotie:  fragrant, forward and charming.</i> <br><br>

<b>1990	The heatwave slowed ripening.  Cote-Rotie suffered but Hermitage is a star for monster wines.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	A drought year, irregular in Cornas, other-wise rich and opulent.</b><br><br>

<b>1988	Unfairly overshadowed by 1989 and 1990, with majestic Cote-Roties for long 	ageing.</b><br><br>

<i>1986	Guigal's wines are the exception to a rather lean, charmless year.</i> <br><br>

1985	Always opulent and soft, these are delicious to drink now.  Good Cote-Roties.<br><br>

<b>1983	Outstanding muscular wines for the long term.</b><br><br>

1979	Lovely soft, elegant and balanced wines that have lasted well, but drink up!<br><br>

<b>1978	A sensational year, highly aromatic, complex and big-framed.  Now rare.</b><br><br>

<center><font size=+2><a name="SRHONE">SOUTH RHONE</a></font></center><br><br>

1994	Early harvesters were luckier, most picked in rain, so probably only average quality.<br><br>

1993	An unwelcome repeat of 1992's weather:  diluted but easy-drinking wines.<br><br>

<i>1992	Torrential harvest rains drowned the vineyards and the results are pretty dilute.</i> <br><br>

<i>1991	The Grenache failed at flowering and harvest time was uninspiring.  Not to be pursued.</i> <br><br>

<b>1990	Exceptionally sumptuous, powerful and heady wines with low acidity, 	already at their peak.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	Fabulously concentrated with perhaps more backbone than 1990.</b><br><br>

1988	Good in all areas:  full bodied and with firm tannins, often termed 'classic'.<br><br>

<i>1987	Pretty poor generally, cool and wet weather with thin wines the result.</i> <br><br>

1986	Mostly picked before the rains, these are firm and tannic with good ageing potential.<br><br>

1985	Charming and ripe, even opulent, and now quite soft.  Delicious.<br><br>

<br><br>

<b><a name="ulabels">UNDERSTANDING LABELS</a></b><br><br>

<b>AC, Appellation Controlee,</b> France's principal and much-imitated quality designation system, devised to protect producers from imitators and to guarantee authenticity to consumers.  Well over a third of all French wine and all of its best wine is AC, sometimes called <b>AOC</b> or <b>Apellation d'Origine Controlee.</b>  For each appellation strict regulations control the area included, which grape varieties may be planted, how they should be pruned, maximum yields, when the harvest may begin, minimum grape ripeness levels and/or alcoholic strength, and even how the wine should be made.  Superior appellations typically fit inside other, less rigorous ones, e.g. Pauillac is an area within the Medoc which itself lies within the general Bordeaux appellation.  Appellations are granted by, and their regulations administered by, the Paris-based INAO (Institut National des Appellations d'Origine).<br>
<b>cave</b> means literally cellar or winery and is often used for a co-operative cellar, as in <b>Cave des Vignerons de</b>...<br>
<b>Chateau,</b> French for 'castle' but in wine context it means a registered wine-producing property whose only building may be a shed or even a corner of a co-operative winery.  Most common in Bordeaux.<br>
<b>Clos,</b> enclosing wall, often used in Burgundy for an enclosed vineyard.<br>
<b>Cote(s) de,</b> prefix usually denoting a superior wine.  Like <b>Coteaux</b> it literally means hillsides.<br> 
<b>Cru,</b> literally 'growth' or vineyard site.  A <b>cru classe</b> is a Medoc or Graves property listed in the most famous wine classification of all.  See pages 160-61 for more details.<br>
<b>Domaine,</b> Burgundian name for the accumulated holdings of one grower.  Thus a domaine-bottled wine is one bottled by the producer.<br>
<b>eleveur,</b> one who looks after wine between fermentation and bottling.<br>
<b>Grand Cru</b> is a widely used term but in Burgundy it means one of the finest vineyards.<br>
<b>Mis(e) en bouteille par/pour</b> means 'bottled by/for'.  France's best wines are almost invariably bottled at the chateau (au chateau) or domaine.  Co-ops are allowed to claim 'mise en bouteille du chateau' for wines from specific vineyards.<br>
<b>negociant,</b> wholesale wine merchant or bottler.<br>
<b>Premier Cru</b> (ler Cru), another vague term but in Burgundy denotes superior vineyards just below Grand Cru status.<br>
<b>recoltant,</b> literally 'harvester', grower.<br>
<b>Superieur,</b> infrequently used suffix denoting a slightly more alcoholic wine.<br>
<b>VDQS,</b> relatively unusual quality designation for Acs-in-waiting.<br>
<b>vigneron,</b> vine grower.<br>
<b>Villages,</b> suffix usually denoting a superior wine.<br>
<b>Vin de pays,</b> superior Vin de Table.<br>
<b>Vin de Table,</b> wine at its most basic.<br>
<b>Viticulteur,</b> vine grower.<br>

<i>Italicized type</i>  denotes lighter years; normal type means average years; and <b>bold type</b> is used for exceptional years. <br><br>



1994	Horribly variable, but Riesling showed its class with super quality from the good estates.<br><br>

1993	A nerve racking year.  Rain hit the early harvests but patient growers picked grapes with welcome botrytis.<br><br>

1992	Not bad, particularly in the Rhine.  Estates had to control yields to overcome dilution from the rains and maintain balance.<br><br>

1991	Ripe, crisp, even slightly austere wines, just the stuff for Kabinetts!<br><br>

<b>1990	Europe's wonder year:  a great autumn with plenty of late-picked sweet wines after a botrytis bonanza.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	A phenomenal harvest.  The late-harvested Rieslings show profound complexity.  Probably best in Mosel-Saar-Ruwer.</b><br><br>

<b>1988	Overshadowed by two remarkable years, this is still a superb vintage of elegance and fruit.</b><br><br>

1985	Classy and stylish, these show how well Riesling ages.<br><br>

1983	Some wonderful treats still in store.<br><br>


<b>UNDERSTANDING LABELS</b><br><br>

German labels are some of the world's most confusing.  Quite apart from the usual advice that producer is crucial and vintage year can affect quality, look for <br>
(1) quality level,<br>
(2) grape variety and <br>
(3) region.  <br><br>
1. In ascending order of natural grape ripeness:  Tafelwein, Landwein, QbA, Kabinett, Spatlese, Auslese, BA and TBA (see below).  <br><br>
2. Most German wines are made from single grape varieties, specified on the label.  For more details see, in declining order of importance within Germany's vineyards overall, Muller-Thurgau, Riesling, Silvaner, Kerner, Spatburgunder (Pinot Noir), Portugieser, Scheurebe, Bacchus, Faberrebe, Morio-Muskat and so on.  Riesling, Scheurebe and Silvaner in Franken tend to be the best bets, although some fine dryish Grauburgunder (Pinot Gris) and Weissburgunder (Pinot Blanc) is also produced.  <br><br>
3. Labels on all but the most basic German wines should carry the name of one of the wine regions (listed on the following pages), which may be a lot more helpful than the often very complicated name of the wine itself.  Like burgundies, German wines tend to be named with a combination of village and vineyard name, although in the case of German a possessive 'er' is usually added to the village name, as in Bernkasteler Schlossberg for the Schlossberg vineyard in the Bernkastel district.  The Germans have made life even more difficult for consumers than it was already by giving vast zones called a Grosslage a familiar name so that it is extremely difficult even for a professional like me to remember whether, for example, Badstube is a Grosslage zone or a small, single vineyard or Einzellage.  Some of the most famous Grosslagen are Zeller Schwarze Katz, Krover Nacktarsch, Bernkasteler Badstube, Bernkasteler Kurfurstlay, Piesporter Michelsberg, Klusserather St Michael, Wiltinger Scharzberg, Niersteiner Gutes Domtal and Oppenheimer Krotenbrunnen - how on earth is the poor wine drinker to distinguish these from the genuine produce of a single site?<br><br>

<b>Auslese,</b> naturally fully ripe grapes produce what is usually a long-living medium sweet wine, although dry, very alcoholic Auslesen are sometimes made.<br>
<b>Beerenauslese (BA),</b> very sweet rarities usually sold at a very high price.<br>
<b>Deutschertafelwein,</b> the most basic sort of German wine constituting less than five per cent of an average crop.  Although see also Tafelwein.<br>
<b>Eiswein,</b> Ice wine, which often fetches more than Beerenauslese.  See page 89 for details of how it is made.
<b>Gutsabfullung,</b> estate bottled.<br>
<b>halbtrocken,</b> half dry, wines which taste medium dry.<br>
<b>Kabinett,</b> the least ripe of the QmP categories.  Such wines can make lovely light bodied dryish aperitifs.<br>
<b>Landwein,</b> Germany's answer to France's Vins de Pays.  Still embryonic as a serious category but arguably the entire QbA category should be demoted to Landwein status.
<b>Liebfraumilch,</b> strictly a creation for export markets.  In practice almost any medium dry, vaguely aromatic blend can qualify as Liebfraumilch, which is traded savagely as a commodity.<br>
<b>Qualitatswein</b> is sometimes used as an abbreviation for QbA.<br>
<b>Qualitatswein bestimmter Anbaugebiet (QbA),</b> Germany's shame.  By far the dominant quality (sic) category, this includes all Liebfraumilch and the basic Grosslage blends sweetened up with added grape concentrate (Sussreserve).  The category also includes, however, some perfectly creditable wines from top producers who decided they needed chaptalization (which is outlawed for QmP wines) to make them balanced.<br>
<b>Qualitatswein mit Pradikat (QmP),</b> the best of Germany, truly its higher-quality wines which qualify for one of the following 'predicates', in ascending order of natural grape ripeness:  Kabinett, Spatlese, Auslese, BA and TBA.  Much of the meat of German Wine Law is laying down minimum grape ripeness levels (measured by a system called degrees Oechsle) for each combination of predicate, vine variety and region.<br>
<b>Sekt,</b> sparkling wine, usually made from imported (often Italian) wine rather than the products of German vineyards.<br>
<b>Spatlese</b> means literally 'late harvest'.  This category includes many fine, concentrated wines from bone dry (trocken) to medium dry.<br>
<b>Tafelwein,</b> basic table wine which may not even be made entirely form German wine - in fact these 'European blends' are often made up of cheap dry white from Spain or Italy, 'Germanized' by a dollop of a particularly aromatic German wine and sweetened by added grape concentrate.<br>
<b>trocken</b> means 'dry' and any wine so labelled is designed to be drunk with food.  It is also likely to be more alcoholic than wine not labelled trocken because the grape sugar has been fermented into alcohol.  These wines are particularly popular in Germany and increasingly so abroad.<br>
<b>Trockenbeerenauslese(TBA)</b> (literally 'dried grapes that were late-picked', a reference to the shrivelling effect of botrytis or extreme heat), the sweetest, richest most luscious sort of QmP wine, produced in tiny quantites and usually sold for fabulous prices.  Noble rot (Edelfaule) is usually needed to concentrate grape sugars sufficiently to meet the required ripeness levels - although some grape varieties (such as Ortega and Optima) have been specifically bred to ripen spectacularly, if not always sumptuously.<br>
<b>Winzergenossenschaft, Winzerverein,</b> two common names for co-operatives.<br>

<b>1994	Quality isn't a problem but quantity is after spring frosts and summer drought.  Really promising; best Rioja vintage since 1970.</b><br><br>

1993	Heavy harvest rains again.  Good but not great seems the rule.  Ribera mediocre.<br><br>

<i>1992	This looked good until prolonged rains which diluted the grapes and encouraged 	rot.  Some stars. </i><br><br>

<b>1991	An excellent year in Spain, only a small crop but impressive weight and structure.</b><br><br>

1990	Another large and fine quality crop in all areas.<br><br>

1989	Plenty of rich and charming wines from both regions.  Ribera exceptional.<br><br>

<b>1986	Good in Rioja but outshone by fabulous Riberas of complexity and power.</b><br><br>

<b>1982	A very great year, the best since 1970, with plenty of Reserva and Gran Reserva wines.</b><br><br>

1994	Sugar and acid levels reasonable despite prolonged September rains.  Not quite up to Tuscany's <br><br>1994s.

1993	Some Nebbiolo and Barbera didn't really ripen before it rained.  May outdo 1988.<br><br>

<i>1992	A large harvest, generally low on weight and power.</i><br><br>

1991	A smallish crop of light to mid-weight early-drinking wines.<br><br>

<b>1990	With colossal power and big aromas these are very exciting, but need time.</b><br><br>

<b>1989	A superb healthy crop.  Top Barolos are thrilling and will need keeping.</b><br><br>

1988	Initially overrated, these are attractive, soft, full wines for drinking now.<br><br>

1985	Many remain impressive, but excessive yields caused some to fade early.<br><br>

<b>1982	Oddly similar to Bordeaux:  gorgeous young, they have the weight and balance to really last.</b><br><br>

<b>1978	Formidable, even aggressive wines that have developed at a snail's pace and still need keeping!</b><br><br>

<b>1971	Classic Barolos:  rare but worth seeking out the big names.</b><br><br><br>

<center><font size=+2><a name="TUSCANY">TUSCANY</a></font></center><br>

1994	At last a dry but cool harvest:  rich and structured.<br><br>

1993	Survived the rains better than Piedmont, concentration held up, but some picked unripe fruit.  Very good wines from top estates.<br><br>

1992	A big crop of rather light wines to drink young.<br><br>

<i>1991	Endless harvest rains so the best are no more than pleasant.</i><br><br>

<b>1990	A hot year and low yields, the ingredients for really good wines, especially for Brunello.</b><br><br>

<i>1989	Distinctly inferior to Piedmont.  Light if not watery, so best to avoid.</i><br><br>

<b>1988	Delightfully smooth wines, balanced and ripe from low yields.</b><br><br>

1985	Initially impressive, now worryingly irregular with some Supertuscans unbalanced.  Buy carefully!<br><br><br>

<b><a name="ulabels">UNDERSTANDING LABELS</a></b><br><br>

<b>Cantina</b> means literally cellar or winery.<br>
A <b>Cantina Sociale</b> is a co-operative winery.<br>
<b>Classico,</b> usually original heartland of a wine zone.<br>
<b>cru</b> is, especially in Piedmont, a specially designed vineyard.<br>
<b>DOC, Denominazione di Origine Controllata,</b> Itlay's failed attempt at a system of distinguishing its superior wines fashioned in the image of France's Appellation Controlee.  Some argue it was imposed too early and too strictly, others that it was too late and not strict enough.  the truth is probably that the Italians do not willingly submit to regulation.  For the consumer, DOC means precious little, for in many DOCs the allowed yields are often far too high to concentrate quality in the resulting wines.<br>
<b>DOCG, Denominazione di Origine Controllata de Garantita,</b> the super-DOC category introduced for the 1982 vintage to which DOCs have since been promoted.  DOCG wines are reliably among Italy's better bottles.<br>
<b>frizzante,</b> little sparkling.<br>
<b>Riserva</b> generally denotes prolonged aging under carefully prescribed conditions.<br>
<b>spumante,</b> sparkling.<br>
<b>Superiore,</b> usually a little higher in alcohol.<br>
<b>tenuta,</b> wine estate or small holding.<br>
<b>vendemmia,</b> vintage.<br>
<b>Vino da Tavola,</b> Italy's supposedly basic table wine category, designed to be on a par with France's Vin de Table, now also includes a significant proportion of Italy's best wines, which don't happen to conform to any DOC regulations, especially but by no means exclusively in Tuscany (the so-called Supertuscans).<br>

1995	Serious drought problems reduced quantities to dangerously low levels.<br><br>

1994	Exceptionally dry but not too hot:  the resulting wines are deep and structured, especially from Barossa Valley.<br><br>

1993	Ripening was slowed by an unusually cool and wet spell.  A challenging year, the whites especially, are more variable than usual.<br><br>

1992	Cool temperatures at harvest ensured balanced wines, exceptional from Clare Valley.<br><br>

1991	Dry weather restricted yields, but the quality is generally fine for all varieties.<br><br>

<b>1990	Ideal weather:  enough water and moderate temperatures.</b><br><br>

1994	Generally compared to 1991, the slow ripening will benefit the reds especially.<br><br>

1993	Erratic growing conditions reduced eventual yields.  A mixed bag with some excellent wines.<br><br>

1992	Plenty of good reds and whites, with Merlot a lighlight but variable.<br><br>

<b>1991	A long growing season reflected in unusually fragrant, complex wines; Pinot Noir strong.</b><br><br>

<b>1990	A modest-sized crop, the top Cabernets and Chardonnays rival 1985.</b><br><br>

1989	After autumn rains, poorly-drained sites suffered, and many picked too early.  Variable, especially the whites.  (Central Coast better.)<br><br>

1988	A cooler summer and light but charming wines to drink up.  Good Pinot Noir.<br><br>

1987	A mixed year, but some marvellous Zinfandels and Cabernets.<br><br>

1986	Only slightly inferior to 1985 and successful for all varieties.<br><br>

<b>1985	Really outstanding:  elegant and stylish with the balance to age well.</b><br><br>

1984	A very hot year, the whites haved faded but lovely decadent reds.<br><br>

<title>SPIRITUAL HOME, SWEET HOME</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<p align=center>
<h2><b>SPIRITUAL HOME, SWEET HOME</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Virginia Woolf once wrote that it was important for each of us to have "a
room of one's own."  On a spiritual level, it's important that we create a
special area for our private selves as well.  A place set aside for
daydreaming, reading, meditation or prayer serves as a "sanctuary" that  lets
us take a rejuvenating breather from everyday life.
 <p>
If you don't have an entire room that you can claim for your private use,
 create your sanctuary in other ways.  Section off a corner of a room,
 basement or attic using screens or large plants. Or convert a closet.  Make
it your own by adding candles, flowers, pictures other meaningful objects.
  Put down an area rug.  Add statues or spiritual icons that inspire you.
 Keep a "boom box" handy to play the music that you like.
<p>
Feel free to make this space anything you wish; the idea is that it feel like
"home" to you.  It doesn't have to be specifically for praying or meditating;
consider this the place where you go to reconnect with yourself.   Ask others
in your home to respect your privacy when you are there.  Each time you visit
your sanctuary, you should feel safe, relaxed.   Think of this as your secret
garden, the place where you can grow and be nurtured.

<B>-OR-</B>
<P>
Make one total donation
<P>
2.  Display our "Penny for AIDS" canisters, which VIAAC will supply, in your branches during AIDS awareness week, November 24th through December 1st.  These allow your customers to show their support, by depositing coins.

<h2><b>CRYSTAL CLEAR

<p>
CRYSTAL CLEAR
<p>
Some people may think of them as a prettier version of pet rocks, but for
believers, crystals have special properties that improve their health and
life.  
<p>
Quartz crystal does in fact, possess electro-magnetic properties.  Used to
power calculators and other electronic devices, those same magnetic
properties may work on the human energy field, as well.
<p>
Crystals come in different shapes, sizes and types. They can be laid on the
body during massage or meditation for balance.   They can dangle from a rear
view mirror to ground the energies in your car (but they won't  prevent
speeding tickets).  They can be placed next to a bed or on a desk to
positively charge the area.  Or you can simply wear them around your neck or
carry it in your pocket
<p>
Picking a crystal is a personal decision.  Besides it's visual appeal, you
should feel a "connection" to the stone.  Hold it in your hand-- does it feel
warm, tingly?  Then it's for you.  As you spend time with the stone, it takes
on more of your own personal energy.
<p>
You may want to cleanse it occasionally of any negative vibration by holding
it under cool running water or placing it in a dish of salt.
<p>
Different crystals can be used for different uses.  Here are some to check
out:
<p>
AMETHYST:  This purple stone has very spiritual energy and is especially good
for use in meditation.
<p>
ROSE QUARTZ: For attracting and holding the love vibration.
<p>
CITRINE:  The yellow stone is connected to the material things of earth; good
for helping attract money and career success.
<p>
SMOKY QUARTZ: Helps "ground" energy; calming and centering when you're under
pressure.
<p>
CLEAR QUARTZ: A good "all purpose" stone; energizing and balancing.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>GUESSING GAME
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Ever knew who it was before the phone rang?  Did you take your umbrella this
morning on a hunch it was going to rain...and found yourself the only one
prepared during a downpour?   Intuition isn't limited to women or psychics;
it's a valuable skill everyone can develop.
<p>
Society essentially "trains" us to think with the logical side of our brains
and discourages  mysterious intuitive thinking.   But If you're facing a
problem, and have thought it through with no answer in sight, going with your
"gut feelings" may open up other possibilities you wouldn't have discovered
with everyday rational thinking.  
<p>
People often suggest you "sleep on it".  This is a form of intuition, as your
unconscious mind sifts through all that's logical, and reaches into what Jung
calls the "collective unconscious":  a vast storehouse of all the information
and experience known to mankind that we each have access to.   Some refer to
this as the Higher Self.
If you have a problem, think about it before you fall asleep, and ask your
Higher Self for an answer in the morning.  The proper course of action should
come to you when you first wake up.
<p>
Intuition is essentially a reminder that there is more going on around us
than what we can experience or know through our senses.    Incorporating it
into our daily lives simply takes practice.  Next time you have a hunch, go
with it and see what happens.  Your first instinct or impression frequently
turns out to be correct, so pay attention. The more often you're right, the
more confidence you'll gain in separating your intuition from wishful
thinking. 
<p>
Daily meditation is also useful in quieting the mind and getting in touch
with the "still small voice" inside one that can provide you with a very
useful second opinion!

<html><head><title>ANGELS IN AMERICA</title></HEAD><body bgcolor=#ffffff><img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>ANGELS IN AMERICA</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
There's a huge amount of interest in angels lately.  Several books on the
subject are on the best-seller list, and those little gold lapel pins are
everywhere.  So what's the deal with our celestial friends?
<p>
For those who believe,  angels can take bodily form but are not human.  They
are higher form of spiritual energy that act as sort of a messenger between
us and the heavens.  Angels are here to help by providing a little extra
spiritual grease when things get rough.   They won't fix your problems -- you
have to do that -- but they are literally "guarding" you from the worst of
things by giving you the inner strength to cope.
<p>
Everyone has several angels that have surrounded them since birth.  Each has
a special function, such as helping in relationships or health.  To receive
help from your angels, you first have to ask for it.   One way is to silently
request assistance, then sit quietly and "listen" for a response.  You may
want to write down whatever comes to mind, not stopping yourself to edit or
censor the contents.  Review it in a day or two and you may find the answer
surprisingly clear.
<p>
When getting in touch with your angels, it's important to thank them for
their help in advance, as a show of faith, and to let them know you accept
whatever they send your way as benefitting "the highest good."  Note:
angels won't cause your boss to get hit by a bus.
<p>
Angels answer every request, large and small, but realize that their answer
may not be obvious.   Be aware of any intuitive feelings or coincidences that
happen. 
<p>
And watch out for any halo-shaped light fixtures that fall off the ceiling.

<title>WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HEAL YOURSELF</title>
</HEAD>

<p align=center>
<h2><b>WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HEAL YOURSELF</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
"As a man thinketh, so will he be."   - The Bible
<p>
More of us are aware that we must take responsibility for our own health.
 But what about the role we play in our recovery from illness?  Many people
surrender their bodies to hospitals, doctors or drugs, neglecting the most
powerful medicine of all:  themselves.   Dr. Bernie Seigel, author of Love,
Medicine and Miracles, offers these thoughts on self-healing:
<p>
1) Accept your illness.  This doesn't mean "give up."  Rather, see this as
just one thing to deal with, not something that rules your life.  Placing
trust in a higher power  as well as your own ability to cope frees you up to
focus on other things. 
<p>
2) See the illness as a source of growth.  Physical challenges offer an
enormous opportunity for psychological and spiritual advancement.  Many
people have found that, having dealt with certain emotional issues, they
recovered.  Rise to the challenge.   That includes seeing everything that
happens to you in relation to the illness as an opportunity for moving in a
more positive direction.  For example, if you lose your job, consider that a
sign that you're heading where the universe wants you to be. 
<p>
3) Don't view illness as punishment or judgment.   It's more constructive to
focus on developing self-love and self-esteem. The body responds to emotions,
both good and bad, by releasing chemicals called "neurotransmitters."  If
you're feeling good about yourself, positive neurotransmitters flood the
body.  On the other hand,  toxic emotions produce toxic chemicals.
 Concentrate on giving yourself the love and care you deserve and your immune
system will fight harder for you.
<p>
4) Don't make physical change your sole goal.  Of course, physical recovery
is important, but the lessons we can learn from the illness are equally
important.  Your healing process should include learning about happiness,
forgiveness, hope and peace of mind.

<title> MELATONIN--THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2><b>  MELATONIN--THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY</b></h2>
<hr noshade>

The hype surrounding melatonin is second only to what must've greeted Ponce
De Leon when he claimed to have discovered the fountain of youth. Millions of
people eager to experience the immediate effects of this latest "wonder drug"
are gobbling synthetic melatonin capsules, much to the concern of some health
experts. 
<br><br>
 Melatonin is a hormone naturally secreted by the pineal gland and credited
with slowing the aging process, increasing longevity and boosting energy.
 It's biggest claim, however, is in promoting sleep.    Normally, the body
releases melatonin into the bloodstream as night falls; it keeps these levels
steady during the night, then tapers them off as daylight returns.
 Production of the hormone often diminishes as we age; it's also disrupted
during travel (one reason for jet lag).
<br><br>
Taking supplements may seem logical but the longterm effects of monkeying
around with your melatonin levels are still not known.  Why not opt to
increase them naturally?  Here are some tried-and-true methods:
<br><br>
1) Follow the body's natural cycles.  Not so long ago, people went to bed
when it was dark, and rose with the sun.  Try going to bed by 10 p.m. and
sleeping in a pitch dark room.  The next morning, expose yourself to bright
light as soon as possible (open your shades or go outside).  This alone will
increase melatonin levels.  Remember to expose yourself to bright light
during the day, too -- sit by a sunny window or walk outside.
<br><br>
2) Get your melatonin from foods.   Go for the real stuff:  oats, sweet corn,
rice, barley, tomatoes and bananas are all rich in melatonin.  Eating any of
these about an hour before bed can help get your prepped for sleep.  Carbs
also release tryptophan, which in turn helps the body manufacture melatonin
(that's why you may feel sleepy after eating pasta, for example.)  Just
remember that to get these benefits, starchy foods should be eaten on a
fairly empty stomach, without any protein.

<br><br>

3) Certain supplements can increase melatonin production.   Vitamins B3 and
B6 convert tryptophan to seratonin, which is the precursor of melatonin.
 It's best to get these vitamins from foods like dried apricots, barley,
whole wheat, tuna and turkey, rice, bananas, lentils, shrimp and carrots.  If
you opt for supplements, take B6 during the day because it may promote
alertness.  B3 can be taken at night, with 1,000 mgs. of calcium and 500 mgs.
of magnesium.  
<br><br>
4) Meditate regularly.  Studies show that people who do so have higher levels
of melatonin.
<br><br>
5) Avoid too much caffeine and alcohol, and stop smoking.  All these
substances drain your melatonin reserves.
<br><br>
6) Keep your pineal gland  -- which manufactures melatonin --healthy by
taking anti-oxidant supplements.

<title>	Add Spirit to Your Relationship
</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2> Add Spirit to Your Relationship
</h2>

<hr noshade>

<P>A partner can be great to have around for movie dates, taking out the garbage or splitting the rent with.  But partners provide something else:  a mirror of your own spiritual growth.

<P>Many therapists feel that relationships are the proving grounds whereby we work out our own individual issues along with those of the couple.  The way we handle our disputes and conflicts with a partner is largely an indicator of how evolved we are ourselves.  The things that drive you craziest about another provide a red flag; we should look a little closer to see what really lies at the heart of the problem and what it tells us about ourselves.

<P>Mundane issues contain an important spiritual subtext -- such as forgiveness and trust --that we must examine.  If you consider your partner a sort-of guidepost on your spiritual path, you may find that resolving the everyday problems goes much more smoothly.  Remember the following:

<P>1) Consider that you are with this person for a karmic reason.  Accept that you serve as teachers for the other and that you are together for something other than personal satisfaction.

<P>2)Respect that part of your partner that desires to grow, to know something greater than himself. Recognize the "divine" aspect in your partner (even if he hasn't changed his t-shirt for the whole weekend).

<P>3) Accept the relationship and respect it as a major part of your spiritual practice.  As with any growth issues, don't assume it will always be easy.

<P>4) View problems as "training."  Allow yourself to see your own patterns, habits and outmoded thinking when troubles arise, and use the experience to overcome them.

<P>5) Hold an image in your mind of your partner as you love them best.  Remembering why you were drawn to them in the first place will help keep things in perspective and keep love alive when times are rocky.

</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>
The popularity of herbal remedies is growing like a weed.   More people are recognizing 
that Mother Nature has a pretty awesome pharmacy when it comes to easing sniffles, 
anxiety, stress and other ailments.
<p>
A few examples:  <b>Echinacea</b>: (pronounced "eck-ih-NAY-see-ah") is 
great for fighting 
colds and strengthening the immune system.  <b>Peppermint</b> also eases a 
stuffy nose and aids 
digestion.  <b>Ginger</b> helps alleviate nausea.   <b>Chamomile</b> calms 
the nerves. and helps you 
fall asleep.   <b>Feverfew</b>  brings down fever, and may be helpful in treating headaches, 
including migraines.   Invigorating <b>Rosemary</b> perks up circulation. 
<p>
The easiest form to take herbs is as a tea.  You can either grow the herbs yourself, or 
purchase them dried in the health food store.  Prepared tea bags are also available. 
<p>
Make your own herbal tea (called an "infusion") by  combining 2 Tablespoons fresh herbs 
or 2 teaspoons of dried, with 2 cups of water.  Boil, tightly covered,  in a non-metal pot, 
then let steep for a few hours before drinking (make sure to strain the herbs out first!).   
Drink about a half-cup a time, three times a day.

<title>Meditation Tips</title>

</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>
<font size=+1>"....Meditation is ..the art of suspending verbal and symbolic thinking for a time, somewhat as a courteous audience will stop talking when a 
concert is about to begin."</font>---  Alan Watts
<p>
Meditation has been used for thousands of years to quiet the mind and help 
attain inner peace.   Whether or not you discover Ultimate Truth, it's a 
useful tool for combating stress and confusion in the life of the average, 
pre-enlightened person.  
<p>
Meditation has been shown to help fight high blood pressure, insomnia and 
other 20th century heebie jeebies, but who has time to sit still for 20 or 
30 minutes every day? Here's a quick version that will help you de-stress 
and refresh yourself: 
<p>
Find a quiet place, and sit, either cross-legged on the floor, or in a  
straight-backed chair.  Don't lie down . You'll probably fall asleep, and 
your assistant may trip over you when he opens the office door. 
<p>
Close your eyes, and breathe slowly in through your nose, letting the air
fill your lungs, all the way down to the diaphragm.  Hold it briefly, then 
exhale slowly.  Most of us routinely take shallow breaths -- a few good deep
ones should relax you considerably on their own. 
<p>
Tell the chatterbox in your head to quiet down, and try to focus on a 
single sound.  "One" is a good basic sound.  Say it, either aloud, or in your head as    
you slowly exhale each breath:   "Onnnnnneeeee..." 
<p>
Do this for five minutes, or even one if time is short.  You should feel 
calmer and more "centered" when you're finished. 
<p> 
You can do open-eyed variations on this quickie meditation, too.  Next 
time you're stuck in traffic, or waiting on line at the post office, don't 
get tense.  Just concentrate on taking some slow deep breaths.   Zen 
teachings emphasize the "here and now" and the natural flow of life.   
Rather than fighting to get upstream (cutting off all those people ahead 
of you), relax, breathe deeply and go with the flow.  That rusty Buick in 
front of you will eventually move faster than 25 mph.

<h2> EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE </h2>
</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>
<center>"He lives most life whoever breathes most air." <br>--Elizabeth Barrett Browning</center>
<p>
Remember how fast your pet gerbil breathed (especially when the cat was
eyeing him)?  Remember how long he ultimately lived before ending up in the
shoebox?  Now think of huge, old tortoises.  Those fellas can live for
hundreds of years.   One reason is the link between breathing and longevity. 
<p>
Atheletes and singers know the importance of breathing all the way down to
the diaphragm.    However, most of us take shallow breaths that fill only the
top part of the lungs.  That's enough air to survive, but not enough to
thrive.    When we sleep, our breathing usually settles into a slower, deeper
mode (one reason we feel refreshed in the morning). Concentrating on taking a
few of these slow, deep inhalations several times during the day can vastly
improve energy levels, concentration and help you relax under stress.    
<p>
Another way to better breathing may be Breathe Right nasal strips.  Available
in drugstores, they were developed to help with snoring problems by holding
nasal passages open.  Many atheletes now wear the band-aid like strips across
their nose, feeling it helps them take in more oxygen.
<p>
A good stretch and yawn may be a lot less obvious!

<title>"HOMEOPATHY IMPROVEMENT" </title>
<head>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<center>
<img src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif" align=left><h2>"HOMEOPATHY IMPROVEMENT"</h2>
</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Homeopathy (homey--OP-uh-thee) has nothing to do with replacing roof tiles or
leaky plumbing...and everything to do with helping the body to heal itself
naturally.    It's a system of medicine based on the idea that "like heals
like", that illness is not  something that needs to be fixed, but rather, a
sign the body is trying to heal itself.
<p>
For example, instead of swilling down cough medicine to suppress a cough, a
homeopathic (homey-o-PATH-ick) remedy would encourage the cough.  This
supposedly stimulates the body's own natural healing powers to overcome the
illness.
<p>
First practiced in Europe, homeopathy came to the U.S. in the 1800's where it
became a standard way of treating illness.  At the start of this century, one
of five doctors relied on the practice, but it declined as medicine became
more "sophisticated."  
<p>
Over the counter homeopathic remedies are generally made from plant or animal
substances, or certain chemicals like penicillin, then diluted heavily in
alcohol to make a "tincture."    While treating yourself with these remedies
has been OK'd with the government,  as with any medicine, always make sure to
do your "homeo"-work first.

<title> TVP-DINNERS </title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif"><h2><b> TVP-DINNERS </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
"Have you had your break today?";  "Everybody needs a little KFC"; "Beef --
it's whats for dinner."  Even though most people are eating less meat, we're
still bombarded with tempting messages of yummy things that previously mooed,
clucked or oinked. You know the drill by now:  eating meat is hard on the
arteries, the digestive system and your weight.   Even chicken and pork
aren't such smart choices, what with salmonella risks.
<p>
But cutting back or giving up meat altogether can be a hard habit to break.
Especially if you fear you'll end up sacrificing yummy Big Macs or buffalo
wings for tasteless thingys that look like spackling putty.
 <p>
A substance called "textured vegetable protein" (TVP ) may surprise you,
however.     Found in health food stores, "TVP" is made from soy, flavored
with spices and available in granules (best in recipes that use ground beef)
or chunks (good in stews, kebabs, etc.)  It comes in chicken or beef flavor
and can be made into meatballs,  meat loaf, burgers, dumplings and just about
any other dish you think of.   Some people have even made an entire
Thanksgiving "turkey" out of the stuff. 
<p>
TVP is much healthier than meat or chicken, too.  A single serving of the
granules, for example, has about 60 calories and almost zero fat and sodium.
It's rich in fiber and protein.  Before you gag, note that hard-core meat
lovers have been fooled more then once when TVP is substituted in recipes.
Here's one to try, that may even fool the guys at Nicky's Pizza in Brooklyn:
<p>                
<table>
<th>"Meatball" Sub</th>
<tr><td> 1 C. TVP granules </td><td>   1/2 C. bread crumbs</td></tr>
 <tr><td> 1 C. boiling water    </td><td>   1/4 C. whole wheat flour</td></tr>
 <tr><td> 1/2 tsp. salt     </td><td>   1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper</td></tr>
 <tr><td> 1 tsp. sage     </td><td>   1/2 tsp. fennel seed</td></tr>
 <tr><td> 1 tsp. oregano     </td><td>   1/2 tsp. garlic powder</td></tr>
 <tr><td> 1/2 tsp. thyme     </td><td>   1 tsp. olive oil</td></tr>
 <tr><td> 4 individual submarine rolls   </td><td>   1 C. spaghetti sauce, warmed</td></tr>
 <tr><td> 2 medium green peppers, roasted and sliced into strips</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Combine TVP and boiling water in large bowl; let stand until water is
absorbed (about 5 mins).  Add bread crumbs, flour, salt, cayenne, sage,
fennel, oregano, garlic and thyme.  Mix well.  Form TVP mixture into 12
balls.  Rub olive oil on palms and roll each ball between palms to lightly
coat with oil.  Place "meatballs" on lightly oiled baking tray, broil until
browned (about 10 mins.)  Place 3 "meatballs" on each roll and top with
spaghetti sauce and peppers.  Serves 4.

What to expect during an overall massage :Generally, you will be asked to be
partly, if not fully, unclothed (you can leave underwear on if you want,
although it inhibits certain movements by the therapist).  The masseuse keeps
your body "draped" with sheets, except for the part he or she is working on.
<p>
Depending on the type of massage you're getting, it's typical to drift off to
sleep.  This is actually good, because you relax and let the masseuse "move"
your limbs for you.
<p>
You will probably be left alone for a few minutes after the session to
completely relax;  then the masseuse comes in, gently wakes you up and leaves
you to dress.  That is, if you ever want to leave!
<p>
 [ To get the name of a qualified therapist in your area, call the American
Massage Therapy Association at (708) 864-0123.]

Raspberry leaves have been reported to help ease nausea and pain during
pregnancy.   Drinking a cool glass of raspberry tea twice a day during
pregnancy curbs nausea and morning sickness.  Drinking several  strong, hot
cups of the tea before entering labor has been said to ease birthing pains
considerably.  To make it:  bring 4 cups of water to boil.  Remove from heat
and add 6 tablespoons of dried raspberry leaves.  Steep 40 minutes.

Non-sexual human touch is a vital part of well-being, one which most of us
don't get enough of.  A good massage by a licensed practitioner is one way to
fulfill that need, and work out specific health issues simultaneously.  And
it feels grrreat!  Here's a sampler of different "hands on" treatments:
<P>
CRANIOSACRAL THERAPY:  Gently massages the head, neck, face and mouth.
<p>
REFLEXOLOGY:  Based on the principal that internal workings correspond to
specific points on the feet and hands.  Stimulating these points helps
correct a variety of problems (and the foot rub feels great!).
<p>
SHIATSU:   Like acupuncture and accupressure, deep pressure is exerted on
"energy points"  in the body to release blockages and promote healing.
<p>
SWEDISH MASSAGE:  Your basic stroking and kneading massage;  improves
circulation, stretches ligaments, flushes out toxins.
<p>
TRAGER WORK: Gentle massaging, rocking and bouncing movements lull you into a
dreamy state, relieving chronic stress, tension and pain caused from
rigidity.

Got a splitting headache?  Maybe you've been too critical of yourself lately.
Stomach upset?    You're deeply fearful of something.   And maybe that cold
is really telling you you've just taken on  too much lately.
<p>
New-age notable Louise Hay states that our emotional and mental states are
deep at the root of every ailment, and should be treated as much as the
physical body. 
<p>
Many researchers agree on this mind-body connection.   Emotions such as
chronic fear, anger, frustration can contribute to cancer, heart disease and
other illnesses. While we can't turn off our emotions, learning to channel
worrisome thoughts in more positive directions can go a long way towards
recovery.  
<p>
In her book, Heal Your Body, Hay outlines the emotional components behind
everything from arthritis to yeast infections, and recommends "affirmations"
(or mental messages you repeat to yourself) to assist in healing.  Here's a
sample:
<p>
ALLERGIES:  "Emotionally allergic" to someone/thing in your life.
 "The world is safe and friendly.  I am at peace with my life."
<p>
LOWER BACK PROBLEMS:  Fears over money; lack of financial support.
 "All I need is taken care of.  I am safe."
 <p>
CONSTIPATION:  Refusing to release old ideas; stuck in the past.
 "As I release the past, the new, fresh and vital enters.  I allow life to
flow through me."
<p>
NAUSEA: Fear; rejecting new idea or experience.
 "I am safe.  I trust the process of life to bring only good to me."
<p>
SORE THROAT:  Holding in angry words.  Feeling unable to express the self.
 "I release all restrictions and am free to be me."

<h2><b>IT'S NOT EASY BEING STEAMED 
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
</p>
<p>

You know you're supposed to eat your veggies.    How can you get the most
nutritious bang for your beet?
<p>
Produce is best when it's as fresh as possible.  If you can, get it from a
local farm stand or your own garden.  You might want to ask the manager at
your grocery store to carry more area-grown fruits and veggies:  the ones
that are carted cross-country in trucks lose a lot of their pep on the way.
<p>
If you can't get  fresh, frozen isn't as bad as you think.  Usually, produce
is frozen within hours of being picked, thereby preserving a lot of  the
nutrients.  But while Popeye may get his spinach from a can,  it usually
contains salt, and the color and vitamin content is pretty low.  Best to save
the canned stuff for use in things like casseroles.
<p>
To get the most from veggies, expose them to as little water as possible and
don't chop them too far ahead  (they oxidize).    Keeping the peel on also
ups the health benefits, since it contains vitamins and fiber.
<p>
A short period of covered steaming is the best way to cook them.   Grilling
is another tasty alternative.  Just make sure your little green friends (or
yellow or red...) are crisp, not burnt.

An old-fashioned remedy for treating headaches involves making a poultice out
of raw nuts and placing it over your forehead.   In a blender,  mix 2
tablespoons each of the meat of pecans and English walnuts.  Add a little
water until it forms a thick paste. Place the mixture on two squares of gauze
and tape to your temples; lie down until the headaches ceases.

<h2><b>FLOWER POWER
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
</p>
<p>
A rose by any other name....might be called a "flower remedy."    Some
practitioners feel that the distilled essences of certain flowering or
blooming plants can be used to treat various emotional upsets, which if left
unaddressed, can lead to physical illness.
<p>
In the 1930's, Dr. Edward Bach experimented with different flowering plants
to study the affect they had on stabilizing emotions such as fear and anger.
 After analyzing them, he distilled the individual flower essences in a
mixture of alcohol and water, the droplets which were taken in a glass of
water or placed under the tongue.  The 38 "Bach Flower Remedies" he
identified are widely available today in health food stores.
<p>
Science is still trying to discover how flowering plants can work on
emotions.  Some researchers feel they may release neurochemicals that can
alter strong feelings,such as anxiety.   The effects of flower remedies are
subtle and require patience to benefit from them, anywhere from 1 to 12
weeks.  Proponents note you may not think anything is happening, then
suddenly notice you're dropping off to sleep easier, or not getting as
uptight with a loved one.
<p>
Although pregnant women should not use flower essences due to the alcohol
content, there are no other side effects.   Some people may be tempted to try
and treat a myriad of emotional issues all at once, since up to six remedies
can be taken together.   Experts however, suggest treating the most pressing
ones first.  When it comes to flower remedies,  pick them one at a time!

Feel like you're just juggling way too many things these days?  If you're
tense and uptight, try....juggling.  Juggling is a great way to take your
mind off life's demands, and have some laughs while you're at it.
<p>
You may think you're a hopeless klutz, but experts (like clowns) say anyone
can learn the skill in a few hours.  Hey, if a guy wearing big shoes and a
funny nose can do it...Start by working on the simple "three ball cascade"
using light balls or beanbags.   Juggling works the wrists and forearms, and
helps develop hand-eye coordination.  Try keeping it going for 15 minutes for
a light upper-body workout.
<p>
Once you have the hang of it,  you'll be able to cope more easily next time
you have too many balls in the air!

Here's a skin treatment, that if performed morning and night for a couple of
weeks, can help wrinkles soften and virtually disappear.
<p>
Take 2 slices of a fresh lemon and place it in a wooden bowl (make sure it's
wooden, not plastic or metal).  Lightly warm some half and half, enough to
cover the lemons.  Cover the mixture, and let it sit for about 3 hours.
 Strain this mixture, then gently massage it into the skin, using the middle
three fingers of each hand.   Let it dry on the skin, then remove the mixture
with a wet wash cloth and a little bit of olive oil.

If you find yourself slumping, you can reach for a Tootsie Roll, or you can
try one of these tricks:
<p>
1) Expose yourself to bright light.  Receptors in the eye take light and
translate it as   a "wake up call" to the brain.  Try and get outside in the
sunlight for a quick    walk, or try "full-spectrum" bulbs in the office.
<p>
2) Do some light physical activity--arm circles, walking up the stairs-- and
get your    blood moving.
<p>
3) Splash some cold water on your face and neck, or go somewhere where you
can inhale a cool, fresh breath of air.
<p>
4) Enjoy a good laugh (even if it means putting a "kick me" sign on your
boss'    back).
<p>
If none of these fail to perk you up, go for the Tootsie Roll!

<p>
 Feeling down?  You don't need chocolate--try releasing negative energy by an
ancient ritual called "twirling."
<p>
Stand with your legs about a foot apart and raise your arms to your sides,
palms up, to shoulder height.  Spin slowly clockwise around your right foot,
visualizing light travelling through your spine and out through your head.
Release any negative feelings you have through this spiral of light.    Then
draw positive energy down into your body from the light.
<p>
Don't approach this like a workout, pushing for perfect form or more "sets"
-- just feel your breathing and the sense of your body in space.  Spin as
long as you can comfortably, feeling the centrifugal force build within you.
<p>
It's better than a ride at Disneyworld!

<h2><b>THE ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE 
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
</p>
<p>
Used primarily by dancers, singers and musicians, The Alexander Technique is
a body therapy that everyone can benefit from.
<p>
Developed in the 1880's, the system examines the way individuals use their
head, neck and spine and how it affects overall body health.    Most of us
are unaware of the position of the body in everyday movements, but
"crunching" your neck while working at the computer, for example, restricts
breathing.  Other incorrect movements can lead to chronic pain and tension.
Alexander proponents state most people are so concerned with the end result
of physical actions that they pay no attention to how those actions are
executed.
<p>
Instructors of The Alexander Techique stress paying attention to simple
movements like sitting, walking, standing.   They guide you in a series of
gentle "reminders" on how the upper body should be carried.  One example:
learning to "release" the head, picturing it as a balloon on top of the body,
creates an incredible sense of lightness and ease in all of your movements.

The old saying, "Water, water everywhere/not a drop to drink" is truer than

these days.    A few  guidelines:
<p>
Bottled water is handy  but can soak your pocketbook with the exorbitant
cost.  Bottled water may also take on a plastic taste, and the conditions
under which the containers are handled may not be so sanitary.    Plus, there
are no guarantees the source of the water is any healthier than what's coming
out of the tap.  Government regulations are still a little dicey in this
area.   
<p>
In some instances, bottlers can supply you with an analysis of the chemical
compounds in their product or you can check Consumer Reports.       
<p>
Attaching a carbon filter to your tap is another alternative.    These are
mainly good for removing chlorine and funny tastes from the water.  They
don't remove heavy metals though.   Remember to change the filter regularly,
or else the trapped contaminants build up and flow right back into your
glass.
  <p>
Steam-distilled water is often considered the healthiest choice.  The
distillation process (used in all science labs when they want pure water)
removes almost all pollutants--but it can also remove the taste, too,  One
solution is to pour a glass of distilled water back and forth--this puts some
oxygen (and flavor) back into it.  Home-distilling is a messy, time-consuming
process; you can buy jugs of distilled water, but with some of the same
caveats as for regular bottled water (see above).
<p>
If you opt to stick with good old tap water, you may want to have it tested
by a private lab, not so much for bacteria, but for toxic substances.
Remember to let the faucet  run for several minutes first thing in the
morning and evening.   Never use hot water from the tap for cooking.  Hot
water leaches out impurities from the pipes.  Always start with cold water
when boiling, making coffee, etc.
<p>
No matter how you get it, though , be sure to drink 6 to 8 glasses of H2O
each day to keep your body properly hydrated.

Don't cry over bee stings.  Put a slice of onion over the spot to ease the
pain.  Keep it on for about 3 hours and you'll find it draws out the stinger,
too.   Just toss the onion slice before it ends up in tonight's meatloaf.

<h2><b>MIND GAMES
</b></h2>
</p>
<hr noshade>

<p>
If you're trying to reach a particular goal,  stop and think about it --
literally. "Creative visualization" sounds spacey, but it's based on sound
scientific principles. The brain is an underutilized, mysterious resource and
learning to tap into it can make reaching your goals a lot easier.
<p>
Creative visualization involves using your mind's eye to experience clearly
what it is you want to achieve.  This can be anything from losing weight to
quitting smoking to marrying Kevin Costner (well, maybe it won't work
there...). Your mind then seeks to duplicate the experience for real.
<p>
Say you want to lose 10 pounds.  Instead of struggling to stay on a diet, use
your mind to help you.  Close your eyes and  imagine yourself at your goal
weight.  See the number on the bathroom scale.  Feel yourself wearing
spandex without fear.  Hear yourself turning down the cheesecake, and the
admiring voices of friends commenting on your willpower.     Involve your
imagination; add as many details as you can. 
<p>
Really put some juice into this exercise.  The more real you can make it
feel, the more your mind absorbs it.   Complete your session by repeating  an
"affirmation":  a short statement that sums up your goal ("I now weigh 120
pounds").   Think in terms of the present, and avoid negative words like
"don't" or "not" ("I am not a fatso") in your mental message.  You can repeat
the affirmation silently or aloud, but it's more effective when you hear your
own confident voice.
<p>
Do your visualization as often as you can , even if it's just to recall the "
feeling" for a moment.     Most importantly, believe that what you're
visualizing will happen.  An enthusiastic outlook is not Pollyanna-ish-- it
energizes the brain to really go for it.  
<p>
Once you try creative visualization, you'll discover that reaching your goals
is as easy as changing your mind.

<p>
OK, so it's not an actual "fountain", but research shows the one thing that
goes a long way towards keeping you young is flexibility.  Joints and
ligaments lose their "juice" if we don't keep them stretched.  They grow
shorter and tighter, and  subsequently, we feel older, less energetic and
less inclined to get up and move around.   Tension also settles into
unstretched muscles, further sapping your energy.
<p>
The good news is that you can improve your flexibility starting at any age.
One woman started stretching exercises at age 65 and is now a member of a
Senior Citizens cheerleading team!  The body is remarkably resilient, as long
as you pay attention to your own comfort levels, go slowly and be consistent.
<p>
Some of the most rejuvenating stretches can be found in yoga.  Not all of
them twist you into a pretzel;  many yoga postures (or "asanas") are
relatively simple, and are very effective in stretching all major areas of
the body.   Ballet exercises are another excellent way to develop
flexibility, and there are plenty of basic sports stretches for
hamstrings,leg and upper body areas.
<p>
A few tips:
<p>
1) Warm up first.  Tight muscles are more forgiving when warm.  March in
place, swinging your arms vigourously, for a few minutes to get the blood
flowing.
<p>
2) Don't "bounce" in the stretch.   It's useless and can lead to muscle tears
and injuries.  Stretching is most effective when you go as far as YOU can go,
then hold the position gently for a few moments.  Release it, then stretch a
second time. You should feel a sense of lengthening,  not pain.
<p>
3) Breathe.   Holding your breath in a stretch only makes your body tighter.
Gentle, relaxed breathing can actually help you go further.
<p>
4) Consider your body type.  While every body can become more flexible, not
everyone will be as limber as a dancer or gymnast.    Challenge yourself
(gently), but don't push yourself to go further than you can realistically
go.
<p>
 5) Be patient and be consistent.  If you expect too much, too soon, you set
yourself back.  Pain gets "remembered" in tissues called "fascia";  if you
push    too hard, your body will just lock up from those old pains. 
<p>
And like anything, consistent practice is the key to progress.

<p>
The thought of  spending hours in  planes,
boats or cars may make some people nauseous in more ways than one.  But you
can prevent motion sickness naturally with GINGER.  Chinese boatmen chew on
actual ginger root during their workday, but you can make your own remedy by
putting powdered ginger root (available in health food stores) in capsules.
Two taken before a trip have been shown to be as effective, if not more, than
Dramamine.

 </b></h2>

</p>
<p>
Forget your hair--try "brushing" your skin each day for terrific health
benefits.  The skin is the biggest organ of the body, but  other than
bathtime, it's neglected.
<p>
 "Dry brushing" works on the same principles as acupressure, stimulating
circulation and helping to loosen toxins.  It also:
<p>
1) Helps eliminate cellulite<br>
2) Helps digestive processes<br>
3) Tightens the skin<br>
4) Stimulates the glands, to help all body systems perform at peak levels
<p>
You need a natural vegetable-bristle brush, which can be found in most health
food stores.  Gently brush each part of your body several times, upwards
towards the heart.   Start with your feet and ankles, then calves and thighs.
Brush across your stomach and buttocks, finishing with your arms and each
hand.
<p>
You can receive similar benefits too by using a loofah brush in the shower
each morning.
<p>
No matter how you do it, your body will thank you for giving it the brush
off.

If you have chronic problems falling asleep at night, try a few of these tips
to beat insomnia:
<p>
1) Try not to eat a heavy meal late at night.  Your stomach is too busy
digesting the   food , which is hardly restful  (plus, it just goes to fat).
<p>
2) Keep your body comfortably warm.  Cold feet and poor circulation are
common    reasons for insomnia.   Cover your arms, legs and feet while in
bed.  In the    summer, a light sheet is sufficient.
<p>
3) Try taking a hot bath -- or even just a hot foot bath (remember those cold
feet!)--    before bed.
<p>
4) A cup of herbal tea made from valerian, skull cap or catnip is a good
snooze-inducer.  Add one teaspoon of the herb to boiling water and let it
steep    for 20 minutes before drinking.   A mug of warm milk is another
alternative.
<p>
5) Try and have fresh air circulating in the room.  If you can, open the
windows just a bit-- even in the winter.

Having a good sweat is a great way to both relax  the body and perk up your
skin.   As your tissues and joints grow warm, they become more supple.
Fluids rushing to the surface of your skin stimulate circulation and create a
healthy glow.   You're infused with a marvelous sense of well-being.
<p>
Create your own at-home steamroom:   lie in your bathtub, which should be
filled with water as hot as you can stand it;  enjoy a cup of hot herbal tea
while you relax. Still in the bathroom, dry off, then wrap yourself in a
blanket for about a half an hour.   Finish with a cool shower.
<p>
You may think you're "flushing out toxins", but all steaming really gets rid
of is water plus some potassium, sodium and chloride.  That's why it's
important to drink mineral water or Gatorade afterwards, and to avoid saunas
when you have a cold.  You need those fluids to help you get well. 
<p>
So next time you want to chill out,  try sweating it for a change.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>QUICK TIPS ON FASTING
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
"Men are the only creatures that eat when not hungry and generally live to
eat, rather than eat to live."  
<p>
       -B.K.S. Iyengar, "Light on Yoga"
<p>
When we think of fasting, most of us think of some skinny barefoot guy
dressed in a sheet who doesn't know the meaning of "drive thru."  But a
modified fast (2-3 days maximum) is considered by many experts as an
excellent way to give the body a chance to regroup or fight minor illnesses,
like colds.    [Some people,like diabetics or those on anti-inflammatory
drugs or steroids should not fast.  Always check with your doctor if you have
specific health issues.]
<p>
The body uses a tremendous amount of energy digesting and assimilating food.
Giving it a complete rest from this process allows it to cleanse and balance
itself.   Ever notice when you're sick, you often lose your appetite?  That's
the body diverting this energy into healing.   Fasting is also useful if you want 
extra help in kicking  addictive substances such as caffeine, nicotine or sugar.
<p>
During a fast, most experts advocate drinking only distilled water (and
plenty of it) and herbal teas.  Drinking juices, or liquid meals is
considered a "liquid diet" and not a true fast.   Do not overtax yourself
physically, and keep warm (circulation tends to slow down). Naturally, try
and avoid watching other people chow down!
<p>
When you break the fast, go gently.  Broth, fresh juices, fruits and
vegetables are recommended.  Work back slowly to grains, proteins and more
solid fare.   You should feel lighter, more energetic....and able to stare
down that Big Mac without fear.

A proven, natural way to curb the mealtime munchies is to take a teaspoon of
bran shortly before you eat.  Mix it into a glass of water or juice and drink
it down.    This has been shown to greatly reduce hunger pangs, and ease
cravings for sugary or fatty foods.  Plus, the added fiber is terrific for
your digestive system.

jet lag.
<p>
1) Jet lag is caused by disturbances in your natural sleeping and eating
patterns.     It's more frequent when travelling East to West, rather than
vice      versa.  Change your bedtime 3 nights before leaving.   Travelling
East, go to    bed one hour earlier for each time zone difference.  Going
West to East,  go to    bed one hour later for each time zone.
<p>
2) Cut down on caffeine before and during the trip.
<p>
3) Avoid sleeping pills
<p>
4) Drink plenty of water on the flight-- dehydration is a common side effect
of air    travel.  Forego alcohol.  It's effects are felt more keenly at
higher altitudes.
<p>
5) When you arrive, spend as much time outdoors in daylight as possible.  Aim
for    a minimum of one hour for each time zone crossed.
<p>
6) Try to stay awake during the day and sleep in the evening; don't take
naps.

<h2><b>GETTING NEEDLED
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Acupuncture, which originated over 2000 years ago in China, is finally
gaining more respect as a form of medical treatment in the West.
<p>
The practice of inserting slender needles (one-tenth the diameter of the kind
used for drawing blood) into certain points on the body has been shown to
provide effective relief for everything from migraine headaches and tennis
elbow  to severe PMS symptoms and depression. 
<p>
Scientists aren't completely sure why it works.  Practitioners state that the
body contains energy pathways called "meridians" which become blocked,
cutting off the flow of life energy (or "chi").  The needles unblock the
pathways, allowing the chi to flow freely again and restoring balance to the
body.  While one session can provide some relief, you generally need an
average of six to ten sessions to completely resolve the problem.  Contrary
to what you might think, the needles don't hurt when inserted -- the
sensation is similar to a tiny bug bite.
<p>
The FDA is currently reviewing new evidence on the healing powers of
acupuncture, which could mean treatments will eventually be covered by
insurance.  Right now, though, the first visit runs from $45 to $90, with
follow-up visits averaging $35 to $60.
<p>
Although acupuncture has no side effects or complications, you should check
that your practitioner is licensed by the state or certified by the National
Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists.  
<p>
With anywhere between 9 and 12 million people using acupuncture each year,
it's one form of treatment you can't poke fun at any longer.

<h2><b>ROLFING:  NOT FOR SISSIES!
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
While it can be a tad uncomfortable at times, "Rolfing" is a deep massage
technique that has some very enthusiastic patrons amongs dancers and
atheletes.  Developed by biochemist Ida Rolf, who studied yoga,  the
technique focuses on manipulating the connective tissues in the body
("fascia").
<p>
Typically, rolfing work is divided into ten sessions, each focusing on a
different part of the body.   Years of poor movement habits, emotional stress
or injury can make the fascia rigid and sap your health and energy levels.
Rolfing breaks up tension that may have been held in the tissues for years.
Patients have been known to cry, laugh and go through other "memories" as
these emotional energies are released in the process.  A remarkable sense of
well-being and lightness is experienced afterwards.  One proponent describes
it as "as good as the best massage you've ever had,  but the effects last a
lot longer."  And who couldn't go for that?

<h2><b>GINGKO BILOBA </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
It sounds like a character out of "Star Wars", but gingko biloba is an
effective herb for combatting certain symptoms of aging.
<p>
The ginkgo tree has survived in China for almost 200 million years;  the
fruits and seeds have been used there since 2800 B.C.  Only recently,
however, has the West gotten in touch with ginkgo biloba's helpful
properties.   In 1988,  doctors in Germany (where it's sold as an
over-the-counter drug)  wrote more prescriptions for it than other
prescription drugs.   In the U.S., it's currently marketed only as a health
food supplement.
<p>
Gingko biloba is most effective as a concentrated extract,  found in either
liquid or tablet form.  It has beneficial effects on the circulatory system,
particularly among the elderly.   Studies have shown it can help in treatment
of their short-term memory loss, headache, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and
depression by improving blood flow in the arteries and capillaries. 
<p>
This remnant of the dinosaur age can help our own aging population feel a
little less "prehistoric."

<p align=center>
<h2><b> INDIAN MEDICINE,  MAN </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
While only recently introduced to the West, ayurveda ("au-yer-vay-dah") is a
form of medicine that has been practiced in India for over 6000 years.
It's considered the mother of holisitic medicine in that it's approach treats
the whole person and not just the disease.
<p>
Ayurvedic medicine views illness as a sign of imbalance in the body.
Treatment  incorporates mental and spiritual aspects (such as yopa and
meditation), as well as physical  ( such as dietary changes)  in an attempt
to get all systems back in balance and working harmoniously.
<p>
According to ayurveda, people are categorized into three main types:  pitta,
vatta and kapha.   "Pittas" are fiery and strong-willed, and tend to burn
out.  "Vattas" are creative and spiritual, but can get anxious.  "Kapha"'s
are physically and psychologically heavy, and have trouble getting motivated.
Most of us combine at least two of these qualities at any given time, with
one generally dominating.  An ayurvedic practitioner will ask detailed
questions regarding personality, sleep and diet habits to determine  your
"dosha" (profile).    A fiery "pitta", for example,  may be advised to avoid
hot, spicy  foods, and to avoid intense stimulation as part of their
treatment.   
<p>
Ayurveda is highly personalized, but some general tips can assist every
"dosha" in becoming more balanced.   In today's world, keeping to regular
sleeping (10 p.m. is considered optimal ayurvedic bedtime) and eating
schedules is most important.  A daily 5-10 minute self-massage with sesame
oil can benefit every body as well.  Do this at bedtime or before your morning shower, paying special attention to hands and feet.   Since part of the purpose of the massage is to quiet the mind, don't read or watch TV while doing it.
<p>
Gee, wonder what Marcus Welby's "dosha" is?
<p>

Healing", available on video from Wellspring Media.

<h2><b>TEA GREEN</b></h2>

<p>
Next time you're opting for that morning cup of whatever, go for the green.
Green tea (the kind you're usually served in Chinese restaurants) has been
shown to have terrific healing properties.
<p>
Studies show that drinking 4 to 6 cups a day can dramatically the risk of
many types of cancer including liver, breast, lung, pancreatic and skin
cancers.  Researchers think the tea works as a sort of super anti-oxidant,
able to block the interaction of tumor promoters.
<p>
Green tea also lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke, by preventing the
development of blockages in the arteries.   It also keeps blood sugars at a
healthfully low level, and helps combat viruses.
<p>
Who knew all that good stuff could be found in one little tea bag?

<p align=center>
<h2><b>PREVENTING CANCER:  THE BASICS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
With experts predicting that cancer will surpass heart disease as the leading
cause of death by the year 2000, it's a good idea to remember these basic
tips for avoiding it:
<p>
1) A healthy diet is absolutely your best defense against cancer.   You know
the    drill by now, but it bears repeating:    Eat more fruit (five or more
servings a day)    and fiber-laden foods like rice, beans, whole wheat breads
and pastas.     Vegetables are a crucial part of our diet that most of us
don't get enough of.     You should eat five or more servings daily, but if
that seems overwhelming,    try to eat a big salad each day.  Forget the
iceberg lettuce:  build it around     dark green, leafy vegetables like
romaine lettuce, chicory, and escarole.   Throw   in some raw broccoli
florets and carrots. Cabbage is an excellent cancer-fighter,   too.  Try
topping your salad with the colorful red version (some supermarkets    carry
bags of it  already-shredded).  Naturally, go easy on the fat-laden
dressings.
<p>
 Additional diet guidelines include limiting fat to no more than 30 percent
of your    diet.  Cut out animal products whenever possible, and  eliminate
smoked or    charcoal-grilled foods.    Go easy on the alcohol, too (heavy
drinkers are prone    to cancer of the mouth, throat and liver).
<p>
2) Take your vitamins.  The best way to get vitamins is through food, but
"antioxidant" supplements like vitamin E, B, C and betacarotene are useful in
diets that aren't quite up to snuff (which is just about everyone's).     
<p>
3) Stay out of the sun, and use sunscreen religiously.  Better to be pale and
healthy than a walking melanoma.
<p>
4)  If you smoke, stop now.  You'll live longer once you've kicked the
habit no matter how long you smoked in the past.
<p>
5) Keep your weight stable and exercise regularly.  In women, estorgen stored
in    excess fat  (40% or more above your ideal weight) may promote tumor
growth.
<p>
6) Know your family history.  If a first-degree relative (like a father,
mother or    sibling) had cancer, you're more at risk and need to pay more
attention to your    health.

 Repeat this process every day until dandruff disappears (usually within a

<h2><b>EYE-YI-YI!</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Some people think that if you want to find out what ails someone,  just stare
deep into their eyes.   "Iridology" involves examining the irises (the
colored part)  of the eye to look for defects that indicate potential
physical weaknesses.
<p>
It's a known fact that liver problems, like jaundice, contribute to yellowish
eyes.  If you're tired or have a cold (or if you're a vampire), they appear
red.  Iridologists use similar equipment  to the kind that opthamologists use
to closely examine the iris.    Like reflexology or acupuncture, they feel
that the iris is a map to the whole body.  
<p>
Iridology won't diagnose a specific illness, like gallstones.  Rather, it
points to weaknesses or inflammation in areas of the body that can lead to
those gallstones.   In that regard, it's a good tool for "preventive"
medicine.  
<p>
Hippocrates is one of the many early scientists who turned to the eyes to
diagnose disease.  In 1881, a Hungarian doctor published the first
comprehensive research on iridology; since then, it's been used frequently in
Europe as a diagnostic tool.   While some people swear it works, many
American health experts regard it with skepticism because the research is
still sketchy.  
<p>
There is no regulation on the practice of iridology, so if you're interested,
do some homework.  Check out prospects through the National Iridology
Research Association in Seattle at 206-282-6604.

<h2><b>CLEAN UP TIME</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Besides the industrial polllutants we know about,  there are plenty of toxins
in the home and office.   While we don't think twice about  conveniences like
TV's and computers, bug sprays or bathroom cleaners, it makes sense to be
smart about the potential health hazards they can cause over time.    A few
tips: 
<p>
1) Computer terminals and TV's give off  low levels of electromagnetic
radiation. 
 Try and stay at least arm's length away from it.   Turn off computers when
not in    use, and limit the time spent in front of them if you're pregnant.
<p>
2) If you use a microwave oven, try not to stand in front of it while it's
being used,    and check to see that all seals work properly.  Newer models
are the best., as    their emissions are lower. 
<p>
3) Keep use of electric personal care devices like electric blankets, razors
and    blow dryers to a minimum.   Electric clocks, fans, stereos, etc.
should be at least    30 inches from the nearest bed, sofa or desk.
<p>
4) Cut down on exposure to aluminum by using wooden utensils with
    aluminum pots, and avoid wrapping acidic foods (lemons, tomatoes, etc.)
in foil.
 Avoid antacids or pain relievers containing the substance.
<p>
5) Besides household cleansers and office products like White-Out,
dry-cleaned    clothes, carpet and even upholstered furniture can cause
things like     headaches.  Air conditioners often recirculate bacteria.
 Keep the air inside your   home or office fresh by opening windows whenever
possible.  Lots of green    plants also serve as natural fresheners.     And
try and get outside for fresh air    each day.

The Chinese use this acupressure technique when they're dieting...and look
how slim most of them are!  Next time you're hungry,  squeeze your earlobes

<p align=center>
<h2><b>NATURAL TREATMENTS FOR ATHELETES FOOT</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
For pesky cases of athelete's foot, here are some natural remedies to try.
<p>
1) Wash the feet and dry them thoroughly, preferably with a hair dryer.
 Apply four    to ten drops of undiluted Tea Tree Oil  (a natural antiseptic)
and massage into    the affected area. 
<p>
2) Wash and dry the feet, then apply Calendula ointment.  This is a
homeopathic    treatment that should be performed in the morning and evening
until you see    improvement.
<p>
3) Chop up some raw garlic put it in your socks, and wear them to bed.
 Garlic is a    very powerful  antibiotic  ( though this may work best only
if you sleep alone!).  
<p>
Some experts also add that you should avoid yeast products, along with
vinegar and alcohol, if you continually pick up athelete's foot.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>COOKING UP HERBAL MEDICINE</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
The use of herbs for various medicinal purposes is hot these days. But to the
beginner, all those dried plants with wierd names may seem a bit daunting.
 Did you know, though, that many of the herbs you use every day for cooking
can provide tasty health benefits?
<p>
For centuries, cooking staples like ginger, garlic, thyme, coriander or
cayenne pepper were used to season food and provide a body boost at the same
time.   Now, of course, we think of them purely as a way to flavor our meals.
  The amount required in a recipe is generally not enough to provide any real
benefits:  try taking them in form of capsules, teas or tinctures (herbs
combined with water and alchohol).  All are available at natural food stores.
<p>
You can also increase the nutritional content of your meals and achieve an
overall "tonifying" effect by increasing the amount of herbs you use while
cooking.   It's preferable to use the fresh kind, and to toss them in near
the end , so the important oils don't cook off.
<p>
Here are a few health benefits, straight from your spice rack  (use with
caution if you're allergic, nursing or pregnant.  Do some research first to
avoid possible side effects!) :
<p>
BASIL:  Used to treat colds, fever and stomach cramps.
<br>
CAYENNE:  Good for the circulatory system, fighting infection and fever.
<br>
CINNAMON:  A digestive aid, also helpful for menstrual problems and diarreah.
<br>
CLOVE, MINT: Good for digestion.
<br>
GINGER:  Excellent for motion or morning sickness.
<br>
PARSLEY:  Helpful in quieting allergy symptoms.
<br>
SAGE:  A gargle made from fresh sage is good for sore throats.
<br>
THYME:  Good for coughs, sore throats, laryngitis.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>DETOX WITH SWEET POTATOES</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Besides being a yummy source of beta-carotene, sweet potatoes and yams have
an unusual health side effect:  they can remove heavy metals from the body.
 In fact, doctors in the Soviet Union have prescribed a diet that's heavy on
the spuds for factory workers continually exposed to toxic chemicals.
<p>
Sweet potatoes contain something called "phytochelatins".  This helps them
bind to harmful substances like copper, cadmium, mercury and lead  which most
of us are exposed to on a regular basis from air pollution.     The
phytochelatins help pass these toxins out of the body.
<p>
So whether you go for them mashed or baked, up your quotient of this
particular tuber for some sweet relief from the hazards of modern day
pollution.

<html><head><title>HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THE PAIN?</title></HEAD><body bgcolor=#ffffff><img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THE PAIN?</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Whenever we're faced with unpleasant experiences -- the loss of a job or
loved one, the breakup of a relationship-- the typical response is to try and
ignore the pain and move on as quickly as possible.
<p>
But true healing requires that we face our emotional discomfort  then allow
it to pass out of us.  Ignoring it simply keeps it locked somewhere inside,
where it continues to subtly (or not so subtly) affect us.   Emotions are
quite literally a form of energy that must be released.  Here are a few ways
to reconnect with those old bugaboos and rid yourself of them once and for
all:
<p>
1) Write in a journal.    It doesn't have to be well-written or grammatically
correct.     No one will see this except for you.  Try re-creating those
difficult moments in    your life as if you were writing a story or a play.
 See what words, images or   
themes continually crop up.  Or just do free association as you think about
a    painful incident.  Write whatever comes to mind.  It may take a day or a
few    weeks to "write yourself out" but eventually you'll feel ready to move
on.
<p>
2) Pound the pillows.   Anger is a natural response to many frustrations in
life.     However, we're socialized not to express it (this is especially
true for women).     Subsequently, the rage we feel remains inside of us.   A
liberating      release is to pile a lot of pillows in the middle of the
floor once or twice a week    and just whack away.  You may be surprised at
the enthusiasm to which you    take to this.  If desired, pretend the pillows
are a specific person or upsetting    incident; feel free to scream, shout or
call them names.  The point is to release    everything you've wanted to say.
<p>
3) Do a guided meditation.   Breathe slowly and calmly as you imagine
yourself in    the scene again.   See yourself as a separate person, and
allow that     person to feel all the pain he or she was denied.  Cry if you
need to.  The     meditation should take about 20 or 30 minutes.  As you come
out of it, place    yourself in an imaginary cocoon of  pink, healing light.
 Tell yourself that     now you're free to move on to the peace and harmony
you deserve.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>A FEW HOMEOPATHIC HOW-TO'S</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Homeopathy is a form of natural medicine that goes by the concept "like cures
like." 
Practitioners match your symptoms with remedies that are plant-based, and in
large doses, would cause similar symptoms.  By giving you tiny,
highly-diluted versions however, the medicine supposedly strengthens the
immune system, allowing it to fight the problem naturally. 
<p>
Many people are turning to homeopathy to treat things like colds, allergies
and headaches. Homeopathic remedies are available in health food stores; but
if you opt to consult a homeopathic practitioner,  here are a few questions
to ask:
<p>
1) How many people have you treated with similar symptoms to mine?  How did
   they respond?
<p>
2) What are the side effects?
<p>
3) When will I begin to feel better?
<p>
4) How many visits do I need?  How much do they cost?
<p>
5) Are there other patients I can talk to?
<p>
6) Is there any other material I can read about the treatment?
<p>
For a list of homeopathic doctors in your area, contact the National Center
for Homeopathy at  (703) 548-7790.

<h2><b>CARROT CURES</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
OK, so you know they're good for your eyes and have lots of healthy
betacarotene...but carrots are great for lowering cholesterol and removing
toxins from the body, too.  Experts have found that eating raw carrots after
eating high-fat foods lowers the cholesterol significantly.   Another
experiment had rats exposed to dangerous chemical pollutants.  They suffered
a variety of physical problems until  given carrots; then, the problems
disappeared altogether.   That led doctors in Russia to advise factory
workers handling toxic chemicals to add healthy amounts of carrots to their
daily diet.   As Bugs Bunny would say, "Couldn't hoit!"

<p align=center>
<h2><b>DRINK TO YOUR HEALTH</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
These days, we're so inundated with horror stories alcohol-related diseases,
that you almost feel guilty having that highball before dinner.  But a
growing body of research indicates that moderate drinking is good for you.
 For example, in a two year study, men who had up to two drinks a day had 26%
fewer heart attacks than those who didn't drink.   The French are another
group who routinely eat artery-clogging cheeses and butter, but who are only
one-quarter as likely to die from heart disease as Americans.  Experts
suggest their regular imbibing of red wine is the difference.
<p>
Much of the research thus far has focused on the benefits of drinking wine,
red in particular.  Seems that red wine has higher levels antioxidants and
ingredients which clean the arteries of fatty deposits.   In reality, though,
any type of alcoholic beverage raises the "good cholesterol" levels in the
bloodstream and helps reduce clotting (which can lead to heart attack and
stroke).   Drinking with a meal also slows the absorption of food, which may
help ward off adult onset diabetes by keeping a lid on the amount of sugar
released into the bloodstream.
<p>
But  as anyone who's quaffed the champagne a little  too freely on New Year's
Eve can tell you,  too much alcohol makes you feel anything but healthy the
next day.  Like everything in life, moderation is the key.  To enjoy the
health benefits of alcohol, men should drink no more than 2 drinks a day.
 For women, who have a lower tolerance, it's one drink. After that, the
benefits  taper off (and the hangover potential builds up).
<p>
And unlike pennies, saving your drink "allowance" up for the weekend is
counterproductive.  The anti-clotting benefits of alcohol only last one or
two days, so spread them out.
<p>
Of course, if you don't drink, don't feel that  you must do so to be healthy.
 Red grape juice has been shown to possess some of the same benefits of red
wine.   So (clink!), here's to your health!

<p align=center>
<h2><b>HERBS FOR EYES</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Several herbal remedies have a clear impact on vision.  One of them is the
herb "bilberry", which is  rich in chemicals that improve night vision.
 British pilots during World War II discovered that eating a jam of
bilberries (a cousin to the blueberry) helped improve their vision during
night missions.    Truck drivers, students and computer operators can also
benefit from bilberry's effect on the eyes.   The dosage must be fairly
concentrated to be effective, yet tests show there are no toxic effects even
at high levels of the herb.   The effects are best experienced right after
taking the herb.    Bilberry is available in tablets, capsules or tinctures,
with a recommended dosage of 80-160 mg two or three times a day.
<p>
All of mom's admonitions to "eat your carrots" was right:  beta carotene
helps your vision by scavenging up free radicals which might otherwise damage
sensitive eye cells.   Fifteen to 30 mgs daily, combined with 5000-10,000 IU
of Vitamin A, can help protect your vision.
<p>
Taking a little supplemental zinc is an effective preventative measure
against problems like glaucoma, cataracts and progressive vision loss.  Like
betacarotene, it's most effective when taken in conjunction with Vitamin A.
  A recommended dosage of zinc is 17 to 25 mgs. daily.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>CHINESE MEDICINE</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
While the West is familiar with the practice of acupuncture, there is far
more to Chinese medicine than just the golden needles.  
<p>
Chinese medicine formally began about 2000 years ago, codified by seven
scholars  in "The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine."  Balance
and harmony are the foremost goals. The underlying belief is that all
symptoms of a specific illness are not independent, but are linked to a
larger  more holistic problem.  The human body is considered a microcosm that
reflects on the larger universe.    
<p>
The force that animates all living things is referred to as "chi."  When
there is a blockage of chi, there is illness.  Or when the two elemental
energies within the body, qualified as "yin" (the feminine) and "yang" (the
masculine) are off- kilter, problems arise.  All Chinese medicine strives to
free the "chi" to circulate in the body,  to bring yin and yang into perfect
balance and thus build strength throughout all bodily systems.
<p>
The flow of chi is  influenced by The Five Elements.  These elements describe
cyclical bodily functions:  the element of "wood", corresponding to the liver
and gallbladder, creates "fire" (heart, small intestine);  "fire" creates
"earth" (spleen, stomach); "earth' creates "metal" (lungs, large intestine);
'metal" creates "water" (kidneys, bladder), "water" brings us back again to
"wood."  If any of these elements is blocked, the chi is cut off and problems
may arise.
<p>
Unlike Western medicine which targets an individual disease, then treats it
with drugs or surgery, Chinese medicine relies on less invasive methods:
herbs, massage, acupuncture, acupressure,  diet and exercise which bring the
whole body into balance.  Alone, these treatments are generally most
effective in easing chronic illness, such as chronic fatigue syndrome,
allergies, colds or other ailments that don't respond to conventional
methods.  However,  the techniques of Chinese medicine are proving to be a
helpful supplement  in recovering more quickly  from radical Western remedies
such as surgery and chemotherapy.

<title>WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM EATING DISORDERS</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM EATING DISORDERS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Some disturbing new numbers have arisen about eating disorders.  A recent New
York Times  article suggests cases of anorexia and bulimia are about twice
the number earlier research indicated.
<p>
Another disturbing fact: the link between dieting and eating disorders is
becoming more obvious.   In countries like Taiwan or China, for example,
anorexia and bulimia were previously unknown.  Now that dieting has become a
fad in those countries, disorders are on the rise.
<p>
Of course, this doesn't mean that every one who diets will watch it spiral
out of control, but it can become a gateway.   What the experts are learning
about treatment for anorexia and bulimia may help the rest of us who wrestle
with that nagging inner voice that constantly tells us we should "lose a few
pounds."
<p>
1) Ask yourself "why?"  Why do you want to go on a diet?  Why do you feel
guilty if you overeat?     Why do you consider certain foods "bad" ?   When
you feel the urge to snack, are you truly hungry or trying to satisfy
something else?  Pay close attention to your emotional states and find other
ways to nourish yourself, like meditation or exercise.   Doctors find
depression is often a trigger for eating disorder attacks; they suggest
patients keep a diary to help them identify the emotional patterns and issues
that lead them to overeat.  
<p>
2) Are your body goals realistic? How we view ourselves is tied up in
millions of images that bombard us.  From  the cover of "Cosmo" to MTV to
 professional athletes, we're imprinted with images that are considered
"acceptable."   However, from a genetic and lifestyle standpoint, most of
these images are unrealistic for most of us.    How did you arrive at your
own goals?  Can you really reach them, or have you just been convinced by the
media that you should?    If you're 5'3", you'll probably never resemble a
lanky, 5'11" fashion model -- but your body can be healthy and attractive
nonetheless.
<p>
3) Stress good nutrition over other diet "rules."   This is one of the main
aspects of professional treatment: a properly nourished body tends to
experience fewer cravings that can start the vicious binge/purge cycle.
 Blood sugar is stabilized and a sense of well-being is established.    If
you find yourself constantly falling off of diets, or snacking wildly,
examine your diet not so much for calories as for nutrition.   
All the processed, low-fat, no-fat, low-cal dreck most of us eat hardly gives
our bodies what they need to run at their peak.  Make sure to eat  foods that
satisfy your body's requirements, not just your tastebuds or emotions.
<p>
4) Have an advance strategy for dealing with problems.   After an argument or
tough day,  people with disorders often find themselves in the middle of
unhealthy eating behavior before they realize it.   If you routinely stop at
the store for two bags of chips  and a pint of ice cream after a lousy day at
work, plan alternate ways to deal with that stress more effectively the next
time.    A massage, some deep breathing or an after-work manicure are better
choices.   
<p>
When it comes to our complex relationship with food,  remember that it will
never satisfy emotional hunger.  Take the time to get in touch with what it
is you really crave and work to address those needs.   And instead of trying
to conform to constantly-changing definitions of what others define as
"beautiful" or "good", decide to treat your body with  healthy care and
respect.  You deserve it!

<title>BARLEY FOR THE HEART</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>BARLEY FOR THE HEART</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
In Middle Eastern countries, heart disease is relatively low.  One reason is
thought to be because of the high consumption of barley.  It's a soluble
fiber (always good for clearing out the arteries) and is loaded with a
substance called "tocotrienol", which acts much like Vitamin E in lowering
blood pressure.  Whether as cereal, flour, flakes or grits, barley is worth
adding to your diet several times a week.

<title>WHAT THE HECK ARE "CHAKRAS"?</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>WHAT THE HECK ARE "CHAKRAS"?</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
"Chakras", which  means "wheels" in Sanskrit, are points of energy running
along our spine.  Ancient Hindus formulated that there were seven of these
energy wheels, each a different color and spinning  in a clockwise
 direction.     Interestingly enough, the spacing of chakras actually match
major nerve or endocrine centers in the body. 
<p>
The chakras can become easily blocked, making us feel sick or out of balance.
 You can clear the chakras by visualizing cleansing light pouring into them.
<p>
The first chakra:  also called "the root chakra."  Located at the base of the
spine.  It is linked to survival instincts and our ability to ground
ourselves in the physical world.  Blockage manifests as paranoia,
defensiveness.
<p>
The second chakra:  located just beneath the navel, and related to our sexual
and reproductive capacity.  Blockage manifests as emotional problems or
sexual guilt.
<p>
The third chakra:  located behind the solar plexus, which gives us a sense of
our personal power in the world.  Blockage manifests as anger or a sense of
victimization.
<p>
The fourth chakra:  the heart chakra, which gives us the ability to express
love. Blockage can manifest as immune system or heart problems, or a lack of
compassion.
<p>
The fifth chakra:  located in the throat, directly tied to creativity and
communication.  Blockage manifests as problems like laryngitis or sore
throats, creative blocks or general problems communicating with others.
<p>
The sixth chakra:  "the third eye."  Located between the eyebrows, this
chakra is the seat of intuition and awareness.  Blockage manifests as sinus
or eye problems.  
<p>
The seventh chakra:  "the crown chakra", located at the top of the head.
 This is related to one's personal spiritual connection to the universe.
 Blockage manifests as psychological problems.

<title>CHIROPRACTIC: ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE?</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>CHIROPRACTIC: ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE?</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Chiropractic treatment as we know it, was created one hundred years ago when
a scientist deduced that the nervous system and organs of the body could be
affected by an out-of-whack spine.   Today, 22 million patients every year
visit chiropractors, who, with the twist of a neck or a crack of a back, ease
many health complaints. Several new studies prove that it is indeed
highly-effective in treating lower back pain and headaches.
<p>
"Broad scope" chiropractors focus on manipulation of the head and spine to
ease problems directly associated with backaches and headaches.  They may
also recommend dietary treatment, acupuncture or other physical therapy.
<p>
"Network" chiropractors are a little more holistic, as they include factors
such as emotional and psychological stress in their assesments, insisting
that these elements can affect the tissues and structure of the spine.
<p>
Although chiropractors comprise the third largest medical profession, behind
physicians and dentists, they still don't have the complete respect of their
peers.   Much of this is because some offer treatments and theories that
extend beyond the normal realm of chiropractic.   Some claim to cure many
serious diseases, like cancer, which has yet to be proven.
<p>
 Some practitioners work on children, which many experts feel can be risky.
 Chiropractors as a rule, only study pediatrics for one semester during their
training.
The manipulation of a developing spine and tissue is generally considered
harnful and unneccessary.
<p>
There is also dispute over the excessive use of X-rays among  some
chiropractors.  X-rays can be used in  pointng out the "subluxations", or
misalignments in the spine.  But as for being able to see actual nerves,
 those don't show up on X-rays.
<p>
Despite the ongoing debates, chiropractic treatments have gained validity,
being recognized by most insurance companies and health maintenance
organizations as legitimate form of medicine.   
<p>
Just exactly how chiropractic treatment works, though, is still a riddle to
be cracked.

</HEAD>

<p align=center>
<h2><b>'SHROOM BOOM</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Western medicine is finally catching on to what Oriental medicine has known
for a millennium:  mushrooms are a powerful tool for strengthening the immune
system.
From cancer to AIDS to the common cold, mushrooms are being added to
treatment with promising results.
<p>
Eastern medicine draws upon about 200 different kinds of mushrooms.  It's
believed that the properties of the mushroom resemble bacteria found in the
body,  and thus stimulate the immune response.  Certain kinds of the fungi
are considered "tonic mushrooms" which help build the body's natural defense
systems and contribute to longevity.     Four of these "tonic mushrooms" are
becoming widely available in health food stores (and some grocery stores) in
the U.S.
<p>
SHIITAKE:   Very popular in cooking, shiitake contains a potent immune
booster that's useful for improving circulation and treating colds.  Another
ingredient in shiitake is being used in Japan for countering the adverse
effects of chemotherapy.   Besides making a mean pasta sauce or stir fry,
shiitake can also be taken as extract, capsules or powder.
<p>
MAITAKE:  This mushroom is just becoming commercially available in the U.S.
and is most easily found in the form of tea or powdered extract.   In some
cases, you can find dried maitake which can be reconstituted for cooking.
 Widely studied in Japan, extract of maitake is the most powerful
anti-cancer agent of all the mushrooms researched thus far.  Combined with
chemotherapy, it allows for lower doses of drugs, yet increases their
effectiveness.  It has also been recommended for people with other
immune-system problems such as AIDS, chronic fatigue or hepatitis.
<p>
ZHU LING:  The medicinal part of this fungi are found in the hard tuber that
grows underground, and is not recommended for eating.  Another powerful
immune booster, it has been shown to slow the growth of certain cancerous
tumors.   The roots can be chopped and boiled for twenty minutes to make a
tea.  It is also available in powdered extracts and tinctures.
<p>
REISHI:    Often called  "the mushroom of immortality", reishi boosts overall
health, promotes longevity and speeds recovery.  It has been praised as an
effective treatment for asthma, digestive problems and high blood pressure,
and has calming properties.   With its bitter taste, reishi is best taken in
powder or pill form.  It is also available as tea, extract or syrup.

<title>THINK YOUR WAY TO A BETTER BODY</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>THINK YOUR WAY TO A BETTER BODY</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Even people who are in great shape still have a "thing" with some body part ,
like wishing their thighs were thinner or that the last bit of roundness
would disappear from their belly.  However, beyond exercise, there may be
nothing that can be done about what nature has decreed.  This is where a
healthy body image comes in.  Self-hypnosis has been shown to be effective in
loosening the distorted thought patterns that can make you "see" your body in
a negative light.    Try using this technique to make peace with what  you
can't change. 
<p>
Self-hypnosis is most effective when practiced daily, right before bedtime.
Prop yourself up on your pillows and give yourself about 15 minutes for the
exercise.  First, state out loud what it is you plan to achieve through the
hypnosis, such as "I will relax and let go of all bad feelings about my
body."  Take three deep breaths.  As you do this, tighten up your muscles
then exhale and let them go limp.  With each breath, feel yourself getting
progressively more relaxed.  Count backwards slowly, from three to one,
allowing yourself to get more and more comfortable.  If you begin to get
nervous or tense, focus on your breathing and let the feeling pass. Repeat
the affirmation, "I allow all negativity to leave my body."
<p>
Now, focus your attention on your body.  Start with your feet, repeating
aloud, "My feet feel warm and tingly."  After a few minutes, you should feel
sensation in the area.  Repeat this process with each body part -- arms,
legs, etc.  Once you feel completely peaceful and relaxed, bring your
attention to the part of your body you're unhappy with, such as your
less-than-washboard abs. Repeat to yourself, "I feel more and more
comfortable with my stomach.  I now stop criticizing it and treat it more
lovingly."
<p>
Regular practice of self-hypnosis is a lot more productive than spending all
your waking hours doing stomach crunches, and will let you view yourself in a
healthier, more forgiving light.

<h2><b>SWEET DIGESTIVE HELP</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
If you suffer from any kind of icky digestive problem--nervous stomach,
indigestion or constipation, papaya can do the trick.  It contains an enzyme
called "papain" that's been proven to bring quick relief to stomach disorders
and  even helps heal ulcers.   Try drinking a glass of papaya juice with a
meal, or eat some of the raw fruit right afterwards (it sure tastes better
than Mylanta...).

<p align=center>
<h2><b>WHAT IS "REIKI"?</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
"Reiki"  means "universal life force energy" in Japanese, and is a form of
bodywork established by a Japanese doctor who introduced it to Hawaii in the
1930's.  The guiding principal behind it has to do with  "chi",  the Oriental
concept of energy. 
Chi should flow freely through the body for optimal health, but can become
blocked by any number of things: poor diet, stress and frequently, emotional
states.    A Reiki practitioner works to sense the subtle breaches in the
human energy field, which extends beyond the body, then heals them by
channeling universal energy through his hands.
<p>
The  practitioner believes energy enters through his head then flows out of
his hands.   Placing them on the affected parts of the body (or floating just
above them) allows the healing force to release blockages.   Standard areas
worked on are the head, chest, abdomen and back and patients generally remain
fully-clothed during the process.
<p>
Reiki is a very subtle form of treatment, usually requiring several sessions.
  Yet many find it to be very powerful in releasing emotional issues as well
as physical ones.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>HOW REST BENEFITS  FITNESS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
After being told you should make a regular commitment to exercise, the last
thing you'd expect to hear is to " take a day off."   The reason?  Your body
simply needs time to repair and heal itself.    This is especially important
for those who feel they "must" do a hard workout each day.  People who run,
do high-impact aerobics or lift weights put themselves at greater risk for
injury and mental burnout when they get compulsive about exercising all the
time  A day of rest  refuels your energy and your motivation. 
<p>
Contrary to what many of us fear, you won't suddenly become out of shape or
gain weight.  In fact, as long as you maintain the intensity level of your
workout, you could drastically cut back on the frequency of it for as long as
12 to 15 weeks without losing significant fitness levels.  Studies done on
athletes who cut back on how often they trained, but who worked out as hard
when they did,  showed they actually improved their performance over those
who maintained their regular schedule. 
<p>
For most couch potatoes who have to be coaxed into regular exercise no more
than one day off a week is advised.  For serious athletes, the number can go
higher.    That "free time" however is no excuse to grab the remote and a bag
of Fritos; by maintaining a moderate level of activity and a healthy diet,
you'll make your return to exercise a lot easier.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>SHOPPING FOR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
If you've decided to include alternative therapies in treating a medical
condition,  do your homework beforehand.  It's safest to get a referral for
an alternative practitioner from your regular doctor.  At the very least,
make sure he's aware of the other treatments you're considering using.
<p>
Research your condition beforehand, the causes and the various treatments.
 This will allow you to ask the right questions of your practitioner.   Also
be sure to ask about his training and background.  What kind of certification
does he have?  Don't settle for testimonials or celebrity endorsements; ask
for scientific research that supports his claims.  This is especially
critical with practitioners who promise big things, or who want you to
substitute their treatments for ones prescribed by your doctor.
<p>
When it comes to the actual treatment, ask how long it's been used and what
kind of success rate or potential side effects it  has.    Be diligent in
checking out any herbal treatments, too.  Just because it's "natural" doesn't
guarantee it's safety.  Know what you're taking, and stop taking it if you
experience anything weird. 
<p>
Check beforehand as to whether your insurance covers alternative therapies
and beware of any practitioners who demand money up front.   They could be
just another alternative to a con man.

<title>NATURAL HELP FOR BRONCHITIS</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>NATURAL HELP FOR BRONCHITIS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Bronchitis -- that ticklish inflammation in your chest  that makes you want
to cough up a lung or two-- affects 7 million Americans every year.  The
coughing fits last anywhere from a week to a month; if it hangs on longer
than a week, see your doctor (especially if you're running a fever or
coughing up blood).   In the meantime, try these natural helpers:
<p>
Inhale the scent of eucalyptus, by placing  a few drops of the essential oil
on a hot washcloth and holding it to your face for 3 or 4 minutes every few
hours.  The cool sensation of the herb is soothing to the lungs.
<p>
Up your intake of vitamin C to help fight the infection.  Eating garlic and
cayenne pepper are also excellent in helping break up the congestion (so is
chicken soup, but you knew that).
<p>
Make a hot compress for your chest.  Fold a large bath towel lengthwise, and
twist it as if you're wringing out water.  Dip the middle third into
near-boiling water. Pull the towel taut to wring out most of the water, then
lay that on your chest over a dry towel.  Leave it for about 5 minutes, and
repeat three times.  Do this procedure every 2 hours.
<p>
Do a self-massage on your chest to break up the mucus.    Take off your
shirt, oil your hands lightly with vegetable oil.  Lie down and use gliding
strokes over the area for a few minutes.  Then switch to slow, circular
motions.    If someone can massage your upper back at the same time, all the
better. Do this once or twice a day until the infection clears.

<title>A GOOD EGG</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>A GOOD EGG</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
The last few years have seen eggs get beaten up pretty badly.  Fears of
cholesterol and heart disease resulted in a sharp decline in the consumption
of our little shelled friends.   In fact, between 1940 and 1992, egg use
dropped from 400 eggs a year per person to 235.    But research has brought
some good news.  When it comes to heart disease, the true culprit in any diet
is saturated fat, not necessarily cholesterol.  
<p>
About two-thirds of us are what researchers call "cholesterol
non-respondent."  This 
means that our livers  keep our blood cholesterol to manageable levels, even
after eating foods heavy on the stuff.   For example,  eggs have 213 milligrams of
cholesterol, yet  they temporarily raise our blood levels  by an eensy 3 mg.
  Of course, the one-third of us sensitive to cholesterol  ("responders")
should watch their egg intake.  Only a doctor can determine this, so get
tested.
<p>
Researchers emphasize that saturated fat is what actually raises "bad"
cholesterol levels in the blood.  Lowering our dietary intake of saturated
fat from the current 14% daily average to 10% or under will slash cholesterol
levels significantly. 
<p>
Eggs can provide an economical, low-calorie source of protein along with
riboflavin, iron, vitamins A & D and phospate.   A large egg has as much
protein as an ounce of meat or chicken and about 5 grams of fat,  more than
half of which is unsaturated.
<p>
A few reminders:  brown eggs or unfertilized eggs are no healthier than
regular white ones.  Make sure you cook eggs adequately (past the runny
stage) to avoid bacterial contamination.  Keep them refrigerated, throw out
any cracked ones and use them within a month of purchase.
<p>
So now that you can eat a few eggs each week without worry, get cracking!

<title>ACIDOPHOLUS</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>ACIDOPHOLUS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Acidopholus has a hard-to-pronounce name, but it's your small intestine's
best friend!
<p>
There are several strains of this friendly bacteria, which naturally occur in
your digestive tract.  Their role is to prevent things like salmonella, yeast
fungi and other nasties from interfering with your system.   Acidopholus also
helps the body absorb critical vitamins like B-complex and K.
<p>
Unfortunately, the bacteria can be wiped out if you're given antibiotics.
 This can wreak all kinds of havoc on your system, allowing drug-resistant
microbes to go forth and multiply.  To replenish the intestinal flora after
it's been eliminated, acidopholus supplements are recommended,  available as
tablets, powders, capsules and liquids.  They must be refrigerated.
<p>
If you just want to maintain a healthy digestive tract, foods such as yogurt
or kefir usually provide adequate levels of acidopholus.  Make sure you check
the label to see what levels of the live bacteria are present.

<title>NOISES OFF</title>
</HEAD>

<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>NOISES OFF</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
You may not live near an airport or a busy highway, but that doesn't mean
you're not being affected by noise.   It's estimated that 40 million
Americans are around dangerously loud levels of noise each and every day.
Two-thirds of those over 80 eventually suffer from some sort of hearing
impairment, a phenomenon not found in less-industrialized countries. 
<p>
 Noise doesn't have to be loud to be harmful.  Constant exposure to low-level
noise, such as traffic, eats away at your hearing too.  The cumulative
"hidden noise" of kitchen appliances or a neighbor's barking dog can have
subtle, adverse affects on your mental health (literally "getting on your
nerves").   Take a look around your home or workplace right now and take
measures to clean up excess noise pollution.
<p>
1) Before you buy a new appliance, compare sound levels and buy the quieter
   model.
<br>
2) If your home is in a noisy area,  use extra carpeting, insulation and
heavy    draperies to buffer outside sounds.
<br>
3) Put foam pads underneath small kitchen appliances and office machines,
such    as typewriters and computer printers.  Use vibration mounts for
dishwashers,    garbage disposals and office machines.
<br>
4) Wear ear plugs whenever you're around even moderately loud noise
(airports,    subway platforms, etc.)
<p>
Your ears will thank you for heeding this "sound" advice!

<title>WORKING OUT BODY AND SOUL</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>WORKING OUT BODY AND SOUL</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
After a decade of high-impact aerobics, grueling marathons and "going for the
burn", more fitness fanatics are turning to workouts that increase mental
awareness as well as physical ability.
<p>
"Body-mind" workouts are those that don't just have you zoning out on a
treadmill, going through purely physical motions.   Ripping through a
step-aerobics class may leave you happily exhausted but not necessarily
refreshed.  Bring your consciousness to whatever action you do, whether it be
swinging a golf club or riding a bike, and you'll improve your ability,
strengthen your body and feel a lot more rejuvenated at the same time.
<p>
There are a number of body-mind disciplines that rely on you to pay attention
to the movement you're making. By doing so, you gain a greater sense of your
own physical abilities.  Pilates (pill-AH-tees) uses slow, carefully
monitored exercises (with and without special equipment) to ensure you are
building strength in the  "core" muscles of your trunk.   The Feldenkrais
Method gently explores the way you make everyday movements, and how those
movements can be adjusted to release tension and stiffness.   The Alexander
Technique teaches you to focus and correct your body and head alignment for
greater freedom of movement.
<p>
Yoga and t'ai chi are other examples of body-mind workouts.  You cannot reap
the full benefits if you just go through the motions and you'll get bored
pretty quickly, too. But if you pay attention to your breathing and sense
where the energy is going in your body, the exercise takes on a whole new
soothing dimension and you'll find yourself getting more out of it. 
<p>
Incorporating regular body-mind practice into your workout routine will put
you in balance.   It will improve your fitness levels by making you more
aware of your body's signals.  It will teach you the Zen-like lesson of
 "being in the moment."    So "just do it" -- but pay attention when you do!

There are lots of foods out there being touted as "healthy."   But before you
take another bite, check out these facts about some of your favorites:
<p>
Granola:  A half cup has about the same amount of fat as a MacDonald's
burger, and isn't any great shakes when it comes to fiber.  Better to opt for
an unsweetened cereal containing any form of bran.
<p>
Honey:  Has about the same nutrients as good old table sugar.  Try molasses
instead.  It contains traces of potassium, calcium and iron.
<p>
Rice Cakes:  Besides having almost zero taste, they also offer almost zero
nutrition.
<p>
Wheat Grass Juice:  A trendy drink for trendy people.  Humans don't need the
chlorophyll this concoction contains, and it doesn't offer any other
nutrients.
<p>
Canned Soups:  Even those labeled "healthy" may contain way too much sodium.
Check the labels carefully.
<p>
Zucchini:  This garden favorite is almost 95% water.  Yellow butternut or
acorn squash are a better nutritional choice in the same family.
<p>
Spinach:  While Popeye's favorite is high in fiber, beta-carotene, Vitamin C
and iron, it also contains oxalic acid which (ironically) prevents iron from
being absorbed.  Don't avoid spinach altogether, just don't overdo it.

<title>SUN SENSE</title>

<p align=center>
<h2><b>SUN SENSE</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
By now, you've heard all the warnings about getting too much sun and the
damage that UV rays can do to your skin.  You know enough to wear
industrial-strength sunblock whenever you're outdoors.   But beyond that bit
of advice, how sun savvy are you?   A few reminders:
<p>
1) It's important to be scrupulous in re-applying your sunscreen throughout
the day.  However, this doesn't mean you can extend the amount of time you
 spend in the sun.  It just means your existing protection will keep
working.  After your designated sun time (which is hopefully brief), move
to a shadier spot. 
<p>
2) There's a difference between "waterproof" and "water resistant" sun
protection formulas.  "Waterproof" types will protect you for about 80
minutes of water time, such as in a pool.  " Water resistant" formulas,
however, only work for about half that time before you need to reapply.
 They are not necessarily sweat resistant, either.  If they streak, you
could have areas of skin exposed to the sun.
<p>
3) A big hat and sunglasses is not enough UV protection for your face.  Up to
50 percent of the UV radiation that reaches earth reflects up from the
ground, even bouncing up off cement.  Cloudy days aren't necessarily safe
either, as clouds only absorb 20 to 30 percent of UV rays.   Make sure
you're always wearing sunscreen on your face.
<p>
4) If you do get a sunburn, a couple of aspirin (which are anti-inflammatory)
may relieve some of the pain.  Opt for soothing baths versus stinging
showers and pat your skin dry.  Slather yourself with moisturizer, but
make sure it's fragrance- free and doesn't contain any alpha hydroxy
acids which could cause further irritation.

<title>FOOD AND SLEEP</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>FOOD AND SLEEP</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Most people find that drinking too much caffeine leaves them sleepless at
night.  But other foods and eating habits can also contribute to a restless
slumber.
<p>
If you've been having trouble sleeping, check the following:
<p>
1) Don't eat too much before bedtime.  Eating a large meal one or two hours
before you turn in is a major cause of wakefulness.  That's because your body
is busy digesting food and isn't ready to "shut down" for the night.  This is
especially true if the meal was spicy or fatty.  Try eating no later than 6
or 7 p.m. If you're hungry later on, try a light  snack.  Milk and cookies
are a classic for a good reason:  milk contains an amino acid called
L-tryptophan that promotes relaxation.  The carbs and fat in the cookies
speed the sleepy effect.
<p>
2) Avoid eating high-fiber and gas-producing foods late in the day.   Beans,
raw onions, cabbage, cauliflower -- they're all good for you, but if they
leave you bloated, it may make sleeping difficult.  Try adding them in small
amounts to your diet so your body can adjust to them gradually.
<p>
3) Not eating enough.  Dieters may find themselves waking up frequently
during the night as the brain sends out a signal for food.  If this happens
to you, you simply need a few more calories in your diet, or a light
 before-bedtime snack.
<p>
4) Drinking alcohol.  Sure, it may knock you out faster, but you'll wake up
sooner. Alcohol interferes with the deepest, most restful sleep states (REM
or "dream sleep").  It's also dehydrating, so your body will crave water in
the middle of the night.
<p>
5) Beware of "hidden" caffeine.   Besides coffee, cola and chocolate, it's
also found in coffee-flavored ice cream and yogurt as well as some non-cola
drinks.  Certain pain relievers also contain high levels of the drug, so
check your labels.

<title>SPIRULINA</title>
</HEAD>

<p align=center>
<h2><b>SPIRULINA</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
This blue-green type of algae with the exotic name is really a highly
concentrated form of chlorophyll.  It's been hyped by some nutritionists who
suggest that sprinkling it on your food can do everything from lowering
cholesterol to increasing sexual potency and boosting immunity.     But
within all the hearsay, promising new research actually shows that spirulina
may hold some benefit in preventing or reversing certain types of cancer.
  One Russian study, for example, fed daily doses of the algae to children
who had been exposed to high levels of radiation.   That group experienced
less radiation sickness than the control group.   In India,  a group of rural
fishermen experiencing mouth cancer were given spirulina and 45% of them saw
their lesions disappear.
<p>
Spirulina flourishes naturally in the alkaline lakes of Africa, Asia and
Mexico.   It's also cultivated in tanks, most commonly in California and
Asia.    Spirulina is available in health food stores, in the form of
tablets, flakes, juices, extracts, you name it.  Unlike other types of
blue-green algae, it shows no toxic side effects even in high doses and is
rich in proteins and  micronutrients, especially beta carotene.  This makes
spirulina a good supplement for people who don't have access to (or don't eat
enough of) fresh veggies.   But if you don't relish the idea of ingesting
pond scum, brussels sprouts start to sound pretty good, huh?

<p align=center>
<h2><b>TEA TIME FOR YOUR TEETH</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
A recent study presented at a dental conference found that drinking tea is a
great way to prevent cavities and keep plaque from building up on your teeth.
 This is probably because tea naturally contains a high amount of fluoride.
 When you find yourself eating sugary foods or sweets, follow your feast with
a good cup of tea.   Steep an ordinary tea bag for about 6 minutes to get the
maximum fluoride out of it, squeeze the bag into the cup then swish the tea
around in your mouth.  You might want to forget adding the sugar, though.

<title>FELDENKRAIS:  A THINKING BODY</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>FELDENKRAIS:  A THINKING BODY</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
You probably just assume that the way you move --walking, getting out of a
chair, sitting behind a desk --is pretty much the way everyone moves.  Wrong.
 Just as speech is learned by imitating our parents and those around us, so
is movement.  If someone in your family mentions that you "walk just like
your father", it's no coincidence.
<p>
We learned how to move at a very young age; at this stage, it's become second
nature  Yet the way you move may not be the healthiest way for you.  This is
where the Feldenkrais Method comes in.
<p>
Moshe Feldenkrais developed his system of re-educating the body after he
suffered a knee injury playing soccer and was told his chances for full
recovery were slim.  Combining his knowledge of anatomy, physiology,
psychology and martial arts, he began examining the way the body moved in an
effort to make it do so more efficiently.   What he discovered is that we
utilize only about 5% of the body's inherent flexibility and range of
movement.  Our unconscious movement patterns, modeled after those around us,
may feel comfortable but can create tension and pain.   By instituting subtle
changes, you can free yourself of these problems.
<p>
The Feldenkrais Method typically consists of a series of 4 to 6 sessions with
a certified practitioner.  Lessons can be done one on one, or with a group.
 You wear loose clothing and execute small, precise movements of specific
areas of your body:  head, arm, etc.    Visualization may also be
incorporated.  The goal of Feldenkrais is to bring conscious awareness to the
unconscious movements you make every day, then to experience healthier
options.   The experience doesn't take long:  Feldenkrais discovered that the
body is inherently "smart."  Once the nervous system is exposed to a more
efficient way of moving,  it will let go of its habitual pattern(s) and
naturally gravitate towards that healthier option almost instantaneously.
<p>
Athletes, musicians, dancers and writers are all fans of the Feldenkrais
Method.  It has also been shown to benefit people suffering from muscular
disorders like cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, and may help prevent
and reverse the deterioration of the body that occurs among the elderly.
<p>
The Feldenkrais Method is not a workout; it's sort of like psychology for the
body,  bringing deeply ingrained unconscious patterns to the surface where
you can change and heal them.

<title>FOUR WAYS TO MEDITATE</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>FOUR WAYS TO MEDITATE</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Meditation is powerful medicine, both physically and spiritually.  Taking the
time out to sit quietly and calm the mind is one of the best ways to
rejuvenate yourself in a busy day, to refresh your soul and allow your body
to relax.   Most of us automatically think of meditation as something that's
done sitting cross-legged on the floor,  focusing on our navel and chanting
our "mantra."   Yet meditation postures can be adapted to help specific
issues in your life.
<p>
If you're feeling victimized or helpless, for example, try a standing
meditation.
Quietly standing on your own two feet literally and figuratively helps you to
attain a sense of your own power and authority.
<p>
Feeling overwhelmed by powerful forces or emotions?  Meditating in a
lying-down position is most healing (just don't fall asleep!).  In a prone
position, it's easiest to access the nurturing, loving energy within you to
cope with those feelings.
<p>
If you're feeling "stuck" or stagnant, a walking meditation gets the juices
flowing again. It's good for creative problem solving.  Einstein, for
example,  wore a circular path in his study from his pacing.
<p>
Of course, the standard sitting meditation is the best posture for detaching
from yourself.  It's the best posture for suspending judgment and simply
observe the life around you.

You've no doubt heard that wine is good for your heart.  Did you know that
raisins (the  grape's shriveled former self) is great for boosting immunity?
 You can make an easy, delicious tea that will give your system a strong
defense against many viruses.
Pour 3 cups of boiling water over 1 cup of loosely packed raisins. Add 1 and
1/4 tsp. of blackstrap molasses, stir, cover and let set for 1 hour.  Strain
and refrigerate the liquid.
Drink 1 cup each day.

<title>TAKING A BITE OUT OF CANCER</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>TAKING A BITE OUT OF CANCER</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
The latest ally in fighting cancer may come from Jaws himself.  Shark
cartilage is now being closely studied by the FDA as a way to treat tumors.
<p>
Sharks, who don't get cancer, are unusual because their skeleton is made up
mostly of cartilage.  On the other hand (or fin), fish with a bony skeleton
do get the disease.
Some researchers suspect that shark cartilage contains a protein strand that
inhibits the growth of new blood vessels, essentially cutting off a tumor's
food supply.
This is what makes it a controversial treatment and one reason it should
never be taken by anyone who needs to grow new blood vessels, such as
pregnant women, kids or those who've just had surgery.
<p>
Shark cartilage is widely available in health food stores.  However, some
researchers think that eating a diet rich in soy products (miso, tofu, etc.)
may have the same effect.
They've isolated a chemical in soybeans called "genistein" which prevents
capillaries from growing and bringing oxygen to the tumor.  This is one
possible reason that Japanese men experience an increase in prostate cancer
upon moving to the West and reducing their intake of soy products.
<p>
The FDA's tests on shark cartilage are expected to be rigorous.  If the
results add up to the hype, however, it's one weapon that may really take a
bite out of cancer.

<title>NATURAL HELP FOR KICKING THE HABIT</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>NATURAL HELP FOR KICKING THE HABIT</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Giving up cigarettes or alcohol is a challenge faced by millions of people.
  About 90 percent of America's 51 million smokers want to quit, but only 20
to 30 percent manage to do so permanently.   About 40 to 60 percent of
alcoholics remain sober for a year after they quit drinking.
<p>
Most experts agree that addressing the psychological and emotional issues
behind these addictions is a critical part of successful treatment, hence the
effectiveness of therapy and 12-step programs.  Medical treatment is often
 another important component, as it can help ease withdrawal symptoms which
are often severe (in the case of alcoholics, withdrawal can be fatal if not
medically supervised).
<p>
Now, natural treatment s are being investigated as another effective adjunct
in helping people kick their butt and booze habits.   Acupuncture, herbs and
diet have shown some significant promise in helping people get clean and stay
that way.
<p>
Auricular acupuncture (in which the needles are inserted into the ear) helped
patients at New York's Lincoln Hospital Substance Abuse Center cope more
effectively with the symptoms of drug withdrawal.  It's also a popular method
for helping those who want to give up smoking.  Acupuncture subtly helps
restore the body's physical and energy balance and proponents claim it makes
withdrawal symptoms much more tolerable.  The effects are lasting  after a
series of treatments (typically about 10 days) is followed.
<p>
Acupuncture calms people and makes them more focused, which is useful during
therapy or other psychological treatments.  It also tends to reduce the need
for medications.  A  Portland, OR Alcohol Intervention Center found that
medication use among abusers--such as anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs
-- dropped 40 percent when acupuncture started being incorporated into their
treatment.
<p>
Herbs are another useful tool in easing addictions, though experts don't
recommend they be used as the main  treatment (in cases of alcoholism herbal
remedies should be medically supervised as the withdrawal of alcohol  may be
fatal).   Herbs help rebuild the body, calm the nerves and make sleeping
easier during withdrawal.   St. John's Wort, for example, soothes simple
depression;  milk thistle is useful in reversing liver damage.  Smokers can
safely make an herbal tea to soothe their jitters:  mix a teaspoon each of
dried chamomile, skullcap, hops, yarrow, catnip and peppermint for each cup
of water.  Pour boiling water over the herbs and let steep 15 to 20 minutes;
strain and drink when you feel antsy (up to four cups per day).
<p>
A healthy diet may be overlooked as an important part of recovery. Smoking
and drinking deplete the body of vital nutrients, which sets up a pattern of
cravings.  Alcoholics, for example, experience extreme swings in their blood
sugar, which exacerbates mood swings, which tempts them to drink to feel
better.  A diet of whole foods --heavy on the grains, fruits, veggies--helps
balance the body, and eases the cravings and subsequent weight gain that
haunt the smoker or drinker.
<p>
Addictions to cigarettes or alcohol are complex and you should always consult
medical advice in treating them.  However, including some natural methods in
your arsenal can make kicking the habit a little less brutal.

The first pumpkins came from India.  Since then,  this cheery orange gourd
has become a staple of our autumn celebrations. Dried pumpkin seeds, however,
are an excellent way to keep your vision sharp year-round.  The
highly-nutritious seeds contain zinc and other trace minerals important to
the eyes.  Which is important  when you're on the lookout for
jack-o-lanterns!

<p align=center>
<h2><b>WATER LOGGED</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Nearly 3 billion gallons of bottled water are consumed each year.  Yet lax
regulations  and differing state standards have allowed for a lot on
confusion on the part of the consumer.  You won't feel soaked for long:  the
FDA has new laws which take effect this year that will standardize bottled
water.   Here are the new categories to look for:
<p>
SPRING WATER: Comes from an underground source, with the water naturally
flowing to the surface.  New laws will require that the source be identified.
<p>
ARTESIAN WATER:  Water tapped from the wall of a confined source before
coming to the surface.
<p>
WELL WATER:  Spring water tapped from a hole drilled in the ground.
<p>
GROUND WATER:  Tapped from a source that's under pressure.
<p>
MINERAL WATER: Must originate from a geologically protected underground
source; contains a higher level of minerals and trace elements than other
spring water.  No additional minerals may be added.
<p>
SPARKLING BOTTLED WATER:  Contains the same amount of carbon dioxide as it
did when it emerged from the source.
<p>
PURIFIED WATER:  Produced by distillation , deionization or reverse osmosis,
as established by federal guidelines.
<p>
These new, simpler labels should make your water choices crystal clear!

<h2><b>NOT-SO-SMART DRUGS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
If this were Woodstock, someone should get on the loudspeaker and warn
everyone, "Don't eat the herbal ecstasy."  Supposedly "safe" mind-altering
drugs, all the rage among the young and trendy, are turning out to have some
deadly side-effects.
<p>
Marketed as natural alternatives to Ecstasy and other pharmacological
brain-toasters, these herbal concoctions contain high levels of herbs like
ephedra and ma-huang.  These herbs have been safely used for centuries in
China for treating respiratory problems, but can be harmful in excess. 
<p>
Sold over the counter at clubs, record stores and herb shops,  these herbal
mixtures are promoted as generating a safe, legal high, comprised of euphoria
and heightened sexual sensatations.   Also called "smart drugs" for
supposedly increasing brain activity, the herbs are often mixed into juice at
clubs and "raves" where kids hang out.  
<p>
Advertisements on the Internet and on the packaging  purport them as "safe
and FDA approved", which leads to a sense that if a little is good, a lot
will give you a truly wicked buzz, dude.  Yet too much ma-huang or ephedra
causes irregular heartbeat, stroke, seizures and even death.  Recently, one
healthy 20-year old New Yorker went into sudden cardiac arrest after taking
the pre-packaged herbs.  A number of other young people claim it makes them
shaky, edgy or nauseous.    
<p>
The FDA is alarmed at the growing number of problems being reported by
ingesting these "smart drugs."  Yet since herbs and dietary supplements are
excluded by the FDA from standard drug testing and regulation,  they can do
very little to control what the manufacturer puts out there.  Makers of these
trendy highs (sold under the name of Herbal Ecstasy, Cloud 9 and Ultimate
Xphoria, to name a few) are pretty much free to skirt the issues of safety
and truth in advertising.  
<p>
While the FDA cannot currently regulate these natural highs, they do plan to
issue public warnings as they continue their studies.   So for now, just say
"no."

<title>LETTING GO</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>LETTING GO</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
All of us carry around baggage:   the residue of fear, defense mechanisms,
past hurts.
Much of this is woven into an intricate net that helps us define who and what
we are.  Our baggage is comfortable and familiar.  But it can also be
limiting.  Therapists and healers recommend we learn to release the issues
and habits that impede our growth and happiness.  But how?
<p>
"Letting go" sounds like such a simple act.  But as humans, we cling
ferociously to all that seems to make us what we are.  We fear that if we
relinquish our stuff -- even if it is getting in our way -- there will be
nothing left of us.  This is the primary reason that letting go is so
difficult .   
<p>
The other reason is our emotional involvement with our baggage:  we still
harbor anger over that relationship; we're still trying to please our parent.
  Defusing the emotional component requires that we view the past with a
loving detachment.  Look at the issue as having brought us to where we are;
realize that it is no longer needed.  When we aren't all worked up about
something, it's easier to release it.  Of course,  don't expect yourself to
do this overnight.  This is a process that takes time.
<p>
An important part of letting things go is accepting that you will never be
perfect.   Much of our baggage stems from a weak ego which seeks propping up
from external sources.  We try to appear perfect to others.  This inhibiting
behavior sets up the cycle of defensiveness and fear that makes for a very
stressful life. Accepting yourself, warts and all, is a healthier choice.
 This doesn't mean you should stop learning and growing: on the contrary,
 surrendering the need for perfection frees you up to pursue growth with
fewer roadblocks and less self-criticism when you make mistakes.
<p>
Letting go of your baggage is a long process that takes time and patience.
Don't hate yourself for the illusions and beliefs that have caused you pain
up to now.  Recognize that they have all been part of the process and have
brought you to where you are.
Now that you are aware of them, you have no more need for them.  Learn to
love them as the teachers they have been, then set them free.

<h2><b>SHAKE IT UP</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
You know about the North Pole and the South Pole....but did you know the
magnetic energy that runs between these two points on the planet affects your
body every day?  This is the basis of a form of bodywork called  (surprise)
"polarity therapy."
<p>
Polarity work aims to balance the subtle currents of energy that run through
the body.
The head is considered a positive pole and the feet are negative.  Energy
surrounds the body as well as coursing through it in a continual flow of
positive and negative charges. Blockages in the flow lead to emotional and
mental discomfort at the very least, and physical illness at the extreme.  
<p>
A typical polarity session lasts anywhere from a half-hour to an hour, and
typically costs between $30 and $100.   You are draped with a sheet or
lightly clothed in your underwear.  The therapist uses a series of rocking
and shaking movements, some more intense than others, to sense blockages,
release them and restore balance. 
<p>
There are three types of touch the therapist may use, all drawn from the
Indian healing traditions of ayurveda:  "rajasic" touch is gentle and
stimulating. "Sattvic" touch is a light, balancing touch, while "tamasic"
touch goes deeper into the muscles and tissues.   Frequently, the touch is so
light that you may not feel anything at all -- until you get off the table,
that is.  
<p>
Because of its roots in ayurveda, polarity therapy incorporates diet and
exercise into the process, along with the bodywork.   It may be suggested,
for example, that you incorporate special breathing and yoga-like exercises
into your routine, that will help you release blockages on an ongoing basis. 
<p>
The intent of polarity therapy is to prevent illness, but it can be useful in
accelerating the healing process of an existing condition.  Proponents say
it's helpful in treating migraines, digestive disorders, low back pain and
other ailments related to stress and tension.  Although polarity therapy is
gentle, it may involve body manipulation so if you have a serious medical
problem, check with your doctor before trying it.
<p>
The qualifications of polarity therapists may vary.   Many learn the work in
weekend courses and seminars.  However, the American Polarity Therapy
Association requires a minimum of 155 hours of training for an associate and
 460 hours for a registered practitioner. Currently, there are over 300
practitioners certified by this governing body.
<p>
So if you're feeling a little off center,  maybe all you need is to be shaken
up a little!

<title>VARICOSE VEIN RELIEF</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>VARICOSE VEIN RELIEF</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Varicose veins are a result of frequently standing or sitting too long in one
position.  Weakened valves in the veins cause a small backup of blood to the
heart.  If you are prone to these unsightly blue markings, exercise is really
the best prescription as this strengthens the large muscles of the legs and
helps support the intriciate network of veins and connective tissues.  
<p>
In the meantime, however, you can get some natural relief.  The French drink
horse-chestnut tea, which they claim shrinks the veins to normal size.  This
may be because the tea contains tannins which act as an astringent for the
vein walls.  Another remedy is to eat mineral-rich blackstrap molasses, an
excellent remedy for many circulatory ailments.  You can also use apple cider
vinegar,  either as an invigorating massage for the area or in compresses
wrapped around your elevated legs.

<title>9-TO-5 HEALTH</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>9-TO-5 HEALTH</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Are you compounding your job stress with unhealthy habits at the workplace?
The things we take for granted-- the office chair, the lighting, the coffee
breaks --may be more to blame for exhaustion at the end of the day than that
wacko boss.
Make a quick assessment of your daily work routine and lay off any bad
habits:
<p>
1) Your office chair.    This is where we spend most of our work day, so an
ergonomicallay-designed chair is a worthwhile investment.  However, most
standard office chairs can be adjusted to increase your comfort levels.
<p>
Make sure the chair lets your feet touch the floor.  Your knees should form
a 90 degree angle.  Extend your knees two or three inches past the edge of
the chair  (if you drape your knees directly over the lip of the chair,
you'll create circulation problems).  To ease the pressure on your back,
don't sit ramrod straight-- lean back a little so the natural curve of your
spine takes over.  Support your lower back by adjusting the back of the chair
so that the bottom squares with your lumbar region and the top reaches at
least to your shoulder blades.  You could place a small pillow or towel at
the small of your back, too.
<p>
2) Get out of your chair often.   This is especially important if you reach
or lean down for things in your desk all day.  Twisting and reaching for
things from a seated position is hard on your back.  Better to get out of
your chair to get to them.  
<p>
3) Check your computer monitor.   Adjust it so that you don't have to look up
or down to see the screen.  Your head should float about your shoulders
versus sinking into them.  And make sure your keyboard is close enough so you
don't have to reach to type.  If your eyes hurt at the end of the day, a
glare filter over the screen can help.  Be sure you look away from the screen
every few minutes and blink your eyes to ease any strain.
<p>
4) Put green plants in your office to keep the air filtered.   Toxins from
copy machines, papers and poor ventilation can drain you at the end of the
day.
<p>
5) Walk around the office for a few minutes every hour (carry a clipboard if
you need to look like your'e doing something important!).  Step outside for
some fresh air whenever possible.
<p>
6) Instead of coffee and a sugary snack in the afternoon, drink a few glasses
of water and eat a piece of fruit.  The combination of caffeine and refined
sugar exhausts your adrenal glands and makes you more tired later on.   A big
reason for fatigue during the day is often simple dehydration.  A long draw
of clean water will bring you back to life, while the simple sugars in fruit
will steady your blood sugar.  
<p>
7) Take time to stretch during the day.  There are many simple stretches you
can do at your desk to unkink your shoulders and neck. Two or 3 minutes of
gentle stretching in the afternoon can revive you considerably, and get you
ready for life after the "9 to 5".

<title>ALTERNATIVE ALLERGY TREATMENTS</title>
</HEAD>

<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>ALTERNATIVE ALLERGY TREATMENTS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
It's estimated that 50 million American suffer from respiratory allergies.
Dust, pet hair and pollen can trigger attacks all too easily.  If the attack
is severe, you should see your doctor; however, there are natural
alternatives that can ease the misery.
<p>
AROMATHERAPY:  Mix one drop of the essential oils cypress and hyssop in your
palm, then take your finger and apply it to the back of your tongue.  While
the taste is odd, it can relieve the symptoms of hay fever almost
immediately, and lasts for a couple of hours.   (Note:  be cautious with
essential oils and test them first for any reaction.  Pregnant women should
not use them).
<p>
HYDROTHERAPY:  Add three tablespoons of ascorbic acid powder (good old
Vitamin C) to a warm bath, and soak for up to two hours.  
<p>
YOGA:  Some experts think stress can contribute to allergy attacks, thus the
daily tension-releasing exercises of yoga may be of some use.    Emphasis
should be placed on breathing exercises for respiratory ailments.
<p>
VITAMIN THERAPY:  Taking 5000 international units of Vitamin A each day is
often recommended for allergy sufferers, as is increasing the essential fatty
acids in your diet.  Flaxseed oil is a good choice.

A Japanese remedy for the sinus congestion resulting from a cold is to
swallow a good-sized spoonful of horseradish.  This also works well for sinus
allergies.  Keep that glass of water handy, though!

<title>SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<p align=center>
<h2><b>SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
If you toss and turn when your head hits the pillow at night, maybe you need
a different kind of pillow: a dream pillow filled with soothing scents.
Dream pillows are small and flat, meant to be filled with herbs and tucked
inside your regular pillow.   Since the olfactory neurons go directly to the
brain, snuggling up against one can create a relaxation response almost
immediately.
<p>
It's easy to stitch your own dream pillow, using bits of fabric or a
handkerchief.  Leave an envelope-type opening in the back for inserting
separate bags of herbs. Some of the most effective ones for inducing sleep
are lavender and hops.   Lemon-scented herbs, such as lemon verbena, are
calming, as are rosemary and peppermint.  Chamomile is reputed to keep
nightmares at bay.  If you have a cold, eucalyptus is a soothing choice.  The
herbs can be used by themselves or in any combination you find pleasing to
your nose. 
<p>
Dried herbs are the easiest choice for your dream pillow ( though lavender
can be used fresh).  The smell should last for some time, especially if you
use a fixative (orris root or gum benzoin, available at health food stores)
to make the scent last longer.  When it starts to fade, just crush the herbs
slightly within the pillow.  Hops, however, are one herb that should be
replaced every four to six months as they can become stale.   Sprinkle dried
herbs with water before putting them in the bag to soften them and prevent
rustling when you turn your head on the pillow. 
<p>
Here's a basic recipe for a sweet dream mixture:
<p>
1/2 cup chamomile flowers
1 cup rosemary leaves
1 cup pine needles
1 cup lavender flowers
1/4 cup sweet marjoram
1 tbsp. crushed aniseed
1 tbsp. pinhead orris root mixed with 4 drops bergamot essential oil
<p>
With your special slumber pillow tucked beneath your head, a soothing night's
rest doesn't have to be a dream any longer!

<title>A SIGH OF RELIEF</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>A SIGH OF RELIEF</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
You do it hundreds of times every day.  You catch it and lose it, but bet you
never thought of your breathing as an instant tranquilizer.  Breath is
something you can access any time to calm yourself during hectic moments, or
to keep from adding emotional fuel to the fire.
<p>
The vagus nerve runs through the chest cavity, influencing nerve receptors
in the lungs.  These nerves are directly connected to the limbic center in
the brain, which influence our emotions. Think about it:  when you're upset,
you breathe in short bursts. Breathe deeply and you calm down.
<p>
Most of us habitually breathe in a shallow manner that only partially fills
our lungs. This type of "chest breathing" is associated with the body's
"fight or flight" response, because it takes in large amounts of air all at
once.  Perpetually shallow breathing causes your body to think it's in a
constant state of stress.
<p>
Breathing from your diaphragm, on the other hand, sends the message to the
body that everything is fine.  To experience diaphragmatic breathing,  place
your hand on your upper stomach under the breastbone and slowly inhale, as if
filling a small balloon.  It takes some practice to make this sort of
breathing a habit.  Stop several times during the day to check yourself.
<p>
When you feel under pressure, a "2 to 1" breathing technique can also bring
you back to calm.   Exhaling slows your pulse; two-to-one breathing means you
exhale for twice as long as you inhale.  If you inhale on a count of two,
exhale to the count of four, and so on.
<p>
Focusing on your breath can help you control your emotional responses during
a crisis.  Most of us have kneejerk emotional reactions that only worsen a
situation.  If someone yells at you, for example,  your breathing becomes
short ("fight or flight") and you either attack or withdraw feeling wounded.
"Breath awareness" keeps your body centered and allows you to detach from
the situation, which may help defuse it.  Concentrate on the sensation of the
air as it enters your nostrils; feel the coolness at the back of your throat.
Don't think about it -- just feel it.   If you feel your mind drifting
towards panic, bring it back to the act of breathing. Your body will remain
calm and your thoughts will be more orderly.
<p>
So next time you're on the edge, take a deep breath....literally!

<title>SOOTHING COLD RELIEF</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>SOOTHING COLD RELIEF</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
There's nothing more miserable than the sneezing, wheezing and aches of a bad
cold.  Until modern medicine can find the cure, keep your tissues handy and
try these natural soothers:
<p>
1) Ayurvedic medicine recommends a ginger tea to thin the blood during a
cold.
Add a little less than a half-teaspoon each of ginger powder, fennel seeds
and    cinnamon along with a pinch of clove powder to a cup of hot water.
Let the mix    steep for 10 minutes, then strain before drinking.
<p>
2) Grapefruit is a good source of immunity-boosting vitamin C, but it also is
an    excellent detoxifier for the liver.  Proper liver drainage is crucial
to a strong    immune system, so eat one or more grapefruit (including their
white pulp) each    day to speed the recovery process and prevent future
colds from developing.
<p>
3) Garlic is another excellent builder-upper of your immune system.  During a
cold,   take 300 milligrams of enteric-coated (meaning:  you won't smell like
a plate of    pasta ) garlic supplements.  You might want to continue taking
garlic     supplements afterwards to keep your system strong.
<p>
4) Your mother always said to drink plenty of water during a cold and that
still    holds true -- but get yourself into hot water, too.  Hot baths are
excellent for    stimulating circulation and breaking up congestion. Fill the
tub with comfortably    hot water and submerge as much of yourself as
possible.  Soak for 15 minutes.    Dry off then get into a warm bed for at
least one hour, keeping your limbs     covered.  Repeat this process two to
three times daily. 
<p>
5) Fresh pineapple juice is a yummy way to give your body the vitamin C it
needs,    and it helps to break up mucus. Drink four to six ounces of juice
(diluted with the   same amount of water) four times a day.
<p>
And in addition, remember these other cold-comforters:  a bowl of chicken
soup, your favorite blanket and the remote control conveniently located
nearby.

Forget those over-the-counter sleep remedies.  Here's a natural alternative
to get you dozing: bring 1 pint of white wine almost -- but not quite -- to a
boil.  Remove from heat and add 4 teaspoons of dill seeds.  Let the mix steep
for 30 minutes.  Drink 1 and 1/2 cups of the lukewarm brew about a half an
hour to 45 minutes before hitting the sack.

<title>TO TELL THE TOOTH</title>

<p align=center><h2><b> A FAST BREAK </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Even with the emphasis on healthy living these days, we're still exposed to a
tremendous amount of toxins and chemicals from our food and the world around
us.   While the human body is designed to rid itself of harmful substances,
the battle is often a losing one.
<p> 
The simple act of digesting food every day, for example, takes a tremendous
amount of energy, which the body could otherwise use to repair itself.
 Fasting is a time-honored way to give your innards a healthy rest .   Its
also been shown to have therapeutic effects on a number of chronic illnesses
like arthritis.  But you don't have to do it for weeks at a time like some
Biblical figure to get benefits; a one or two day fast can do almost any body
some good.
<p>
Some purists choose to fast  by drinking only water. If you choose this
method, its important to drink the cleanest kind available.  Distilled is a
good choice.   To vary the monotony, try drinking it with a slice of fresh
lemon.
<p>
If this seems too extreme, another option is to drink only fresh juices.
While health food stores stock bottled juices, its much better to make your
own from fresh fruits and veggies.  Fresh juices provide important nutrients
normally supplied by solid food, and are more interesting than plain water.
Pick organic produce if possible, and use a juicing machine (they're fairly
inexpensive and do a better job than a blender).  Vary your juices between
whatever fruit and vegetables you prefer, but be sure to drink plenty of
water as well.
<p>
Its not uncommon to feel a little weak or lightheaded during a fast.  You
shouldn't try to push yourself.  And while short fasts are generally OK for
most people, check with your doctor if you have any health concerns or
problems.  Remember to break your fast sensibly (meaning: no cheeseburgers);
eat lightly or you'll just undo all the good you've just done.  
<p>
If you can't stomach a fast of one or two days, do a "mini fast" on a daily
basis.  Up your  intake of fresh produce, drink lots of water and try to eat
your last meal of the day no later than 6 or 7 p.m.   Then, consume nothing
but water until breakfast the next morning. Those small steps will help keep
your system clean and give it a breather.

<p align=center><h2><b> CONQUER PMS CRAVINGS </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Almost every woman can relate to the zany food cravings that show up every
month.  Sweet foods, salty foods, sardines and chocolate sauce -- your body
demands some nutty things.  Studies show that women consume almost 87 percent
more calories during this time, mostly from sugar and fat.  Wildly
fluctuating appetites are attributed to fluctuating estrogen levels.  At the
same time, serotinin (a brain chemical that works as a mood elevator) drops.
 Eating lots of carbohydrates and sweets temporarily raises serotinin, but
plays havoc with your blood sugar, triggering more mood swings and cravings.
 What's a girl to do?  Try the following suggestions:
<ol>
<li>Be nutritionally prepared before PMS.  Eat  a healthy diet of low-fat
meals high    in complex carbohydrates every day.
<li>If you must feed a sugar craving, opt for low-fat healthy "sweet fixes"
 Try half a    bagel with jam, or a handful of dry Cheerios and raisins.
<li>Don't allow yourself to go too long between meals.  PMS pigouts may be
triggered as much by appetite as by hormones, so try and eat light meals
or snacks every few hours to keep blood sugar level.
<li>Try and keep your chocolate habit in control.  Go for really good quality
    chocolate in small doses, versus inhaling a case of high-fat, cheap
stuff.
<li>A macrobiotic trick for squashing the yearning for sweets is to eat
something    bitter or pickled....like a pickle!
<li>If you go for the salty stuff during PMS, opt for salt substitutes like
miso or herb    mixtures to reduce the water retention and bloating excess
salt causes.
<li>Regular exercise is good preventive medicine all month long, but is
particularly    effective during PMS because it balances out certain blood
chemicals and    helps ease the stress that can lead to overeating. 
<li>If you can manage it, stay away from alcohol, coffee, tea and sodas,
processed    meat products like hot dogs, bottled salad dressings, pizza,
chips and of course,   sugary foods.

<p align=center><h2><b> LUNCH IN A GLASS?</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
Lots of ads are promoting the benefits of liquid meals for those times when
you're too busy to eat real food or need a between-meal lift.   But how
healthy are they really?
<p>
Originally,  nutritional drinks were meant for hospital patients unable to
eat solid food.  Indeed, most contain about one-fifth of the nutrients you
need on a daily basis, especially calcium.   But the drinks also contain a
lot of calories (200 is average) and can be heavy on the fat.  Because they
tend to be milk-based, they may not be a great choice for people who are
lactose-intolerant.
<p>
The manufacturers claim that the vitamins and minerals in the drinks are
easily absorbed in this form, which makes them a good supplement to the diet.
 The fat and calories however don't make them a great choice for someone
interested in losing weight.  
<p>
Next time you're in a hurry, take a tip from nutritionists who recommend a
glass of low-fat milk and a piece of fruit rather than canning your food.

<p align=center><h2><b>SPRING INTO WARMER SEASONS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<p>
As cold, wintry weather gives way to the bloom of spring, each of us  feels a sense of rebirth.  Our bodies are far more sensitive to changes of season than we think.  In fact, many cultures have specific wellness rituals linked to the cycles of the natural world.  Here are a few ways you can put more "spring" in your step and welcome warmer weather:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Chinese medicine links the spring season with the element of "wood", which in turn corresponds to the liver and gallbladder.  Therefore, giving these organs a little spring cleaning is a good idea. Advocates of Chinese medicine recommend herbs that will strengthen the liver and help circulate "chi" or energy.   Try a formula called Chai Hu Gui Zhi Tang, generally found in health food stores.

<li>Practice "qigong", a system of Chinese exercises designed to strengthen body, mind and spirit.  If done diligently, even just five or ten minutes a day will provide significant benefits.  This exercise helps release and circulate the body's energy: Stand with knees slightly bent.  Take a few deep breaths, relax the mind. Rub your hands together rapidly to generate heat then place them on your midsection at the lower edge of your ribcage.  Hands should be half on and half off the ribs, rubbing gently.  Your right hand is warming your liver while the left is warming the spleen.  When ready, stop rubbing and hold your hands in place, feeling the energy flowing into your organs.  Afterwards, let your hands drift down, wiggle your fingers, gently bounce up and down on your toes.  Shake your arms, be spontaneous.  These movements will allow the "chi" to circulate through the body.

<li>In the springtime, Indian medicine, or "ayurveda", suggests eating light but pungent foods to cleanse the system.  Drink ginger tea or add ginger to foods.  Use black pepper, cloves, cinnamon or cardamom.   Bitter foods like spinach, greens and sprouts, or astringent foods like green beans and lentils are good.  Drink plenty of plain, hot water throughout the day.

<li>Use aromatherapy to remind your body of the natural smells of spring.  Oils from coniferous trees like fir, pine, spruce or juniper fill the lungs with energy.

<li>Do a light fast for a few days.  Fasting cleans out the old and stimulates the growth of new cells.   Start by eating nothing but raw fruit, salads and steamed veggies for a day.  Avoid tomatoes and potatoes, along with citrus fruits and juices -- they can irritate the system during a fast.   Be sure to drink plenty of liquids: water, herb teas and vegetable broth are good.  On the second and third day, do a liquid fast with nothing but fresh vegetable juices, spring water, herb teas and vegetable broth .  Drink at least five quarts of liquid per day.  To end the fast on the fourth day, repeat the first day's menu.

<p align=center><h2><b>NATURAL TREATMENT FOR BREAST CYSTS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<p>
Fibrocystic breast disease  ("FBD") is present in about 80 percent of
pre-menopausal women.  Benign cysts fill with fluid, causing pain and
soreness in one or both breasts.  The cysts may be hard or soft, usually move freely and respond to the female cycle:  for instance, many women claim more breast pain during PMS.  Cancerous lumps on the other hand are hard and generally don't move or cause tenderness. 
<p>
The cause of cysts are unknown.   They can be treated with  hormone therapy or by inserting a thin needle into the sac to drain the fluid.  However, certain simple dietary and nutritional guidelines may deliver relief just as effectively.
<p>
<ol>
<LI>Echinacea, red clover, poke root and goldenseal have shown some success in treating FBD.  Parsley also helps reduce swelling.  Evening primrose oil rubbed daily onto the breasts has also been shown to reduce the size of the cysts.

<li>Consume a low-fat, high-fiber diet of raw foods, beans, seeds, nuts and whole grains.  Eating bananas, grapes, grapefruit, apples, yogurt and at least 3 daily servings of fresh veggies is especially good.

<li>Avoid animal fats, cooking oils, fried foods, salt, sugar and white flour.

<li>Cut out tobacco.

<li>Cut out caffeine. Many women find eliminating caffeine and
caffeine-containing    substances, like chocolate, resulted in the
disappearance of their cysts.

<li>Take a daily supplements of vitamin E,  A,C and B-complex (go easy on Vitamin A, though -- too much can lead to toxicity.  Stick to the
recommended dosage only). Check out coenzyme Q10.  This is an
antioxidant similar to Vitamin E, but much more potent. 
</ol>
<P>
Remember:  a regular mammogram and monthly self-exams are important to
determine if any lumps you detect are in fact harmless cysts and not
something more serious.

your mouth?
Here are some natural ways to get back on track:
<p>1) An aromatherapy cocktail can quell the queasiness.  Mix four ounces of
water,    the juice of half of a lemon and a drop or two of fennel essential
oil and drink    before breakfast.  (Do your homework on fennel oil before
you need it  to     determine any allergic reactions).
<p>2) Ayurvedic doctors recommend stirring a teaspoon of lime juice and a pinch
of    cumin into a cup of fresh orange juice and drinking.
<p>3) A homeopathic remedy for nausea and hangovers is "nux vomica" (nice name).
   Available in health food stores, take one 6C or 12C tablet every 3 to 4
hours as    needed.
<p>4) Fresh juices are helpful in speeding a hangover away.  They flush the
system of   toxins and rehydrate your body.  Assuming you can drag yourself
to the kitchen,   blend 8 ounces of carrot juice, 1 ounce of beet juice, 4
ounces of celery juice    and 1/2 to 1 ounce of parsley juice.  Drink a glass
in the morning, and another    later on to stimulate your poor, abused liver.
<p>5) A readily-available mixture called "E-mergen-C" contains B vitamins,
vitamin C    and minerals to replace the nutrients that are destroyed during
heavy drinking.     Follow the dosage directions to help relieve your
hangover. 
<p>As you sit there with the icepack on your head, remember that you'll probably
only use these remedies once... because you'll "never drink again", right?!

right? But the way you brush them is critical to your long-term dental
health.
<p>For instance, never use a hard-bristled brush.  It's far too abrasive on
tooth enamel.  Go for the soft-bristled kind, and make sure it's recommended
by the American Dental Association.  
<p>Try to brush longer, not harder.  That 10-second turbo-blast at the end of
the day may seem like it does the trick, but it's not very effective and
leaves you open to sensitive teeth and gums, as well as cavities that can
form at the root.  Use small, circular motions and think of "massaging" your
teeth clean.
<p>Tilt the brush to 45 degrees to get teeth and gums at the same time.  To
reach the insides of your top and bottom front teeth, use the brush like a
lollipop, brushing with an in and out motion.  Short back and forth strokes
will take care of the biting surfaces, and a good swipe across the tongue
will get rid of bacteria and keep breath fresh.
<p>It's important to brush at least twice every 24 hours (more often if
possible).  This will keep tartar -- you know, that stuff that your dentist
needs a sandblaster to get off? -- at bay.
<p>Keep these simple tips in mind, and you'll have something to smile about for
a long, long time.

 SNEAKY WAYS TO GET FIT <br><br>
Unless you've been living in a cave, you're well aware that regular exercise
is critical to good health.   But even though the fitness boom is in full
swing, there are still plenty of couch spuds out there with a million reasons
for avoiding a little sweat.
<br><br>
Time is the most common complaint.  You probably think you've got to commit
yourself to an hour or more each day to get in shape. That certainly would be
terrific, but it's hardly realistic.  The good news is that experts now say
that exercise done in "chunks" of time -- say 10 minute blocks, 3 times a day
-- can be as effective as a 30 minute workout in many ways.  Take advantage
of odd moments during your day to grab a "fitness break."  Here are some
suggestions:
<br><br>
1) Walk whenever possible.  This is one of the best, most effective exercises
going and anyone can do it almost anytime.   Park your car far away from the
grocery store or the mall and hoof it the rest of the way.  Walk for 15
minutes on your lunch break.   Take a stroll after dinner.  Take the dog out
for an extra bit of fresh air.
<br><br>
2) Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Climbing uses the large muscles
of your legs and gives your heart a good workout.
<br><br>
3) Keep a set of weights by the TV or the phone and do some bicep curls.
 Building muscle helps your body burn fat more rapidly.
<br><br>
4) Remember how much fun jumping rope was when you were a kid? Keep one
nearby and get up from the couch or the desk to do 50 or 100 jumps every now
and again.  You'll see why boxers rely on it for a cardio workout!
<br><br>
5) Hide the remote and get off the couch to change the TV channel (unless
you're content being stuck on the Trout Channel all night long).
<br><br>
6) If you've got a stationary bike, treadmill or some other piece of
equipment gathering dust in the corner, try hopping on it for just five or
ten minutes at a time.
Try five minutes in the morning before your shower and another few before
dinner.
Think of breaking your workout into bite-sized bits throughout the day; it'll
be a lot easier to fit it in. 
<br><br>
7) Add some "oomph" to daily activities like dusting, vacuuming, sweeping,
washing the car.  Make your movements big and energetic;  think about what
you're doing and put your body into it.
<br><br>
8) When you take Junior to the park, don't just sit on the bench with the
pigeons; get up and follow him onto the jungle gym or wherever he runs off
to.  Trying to keep up with him will be a workout in itself!
<br><br>
9) Find new ways to have fun that involve physical activity:  go dancing
instead of to the movies.  Try a rollerblading date instead of a sit-down
brunch.   Explore the greenery of a nearby park by walking through it instead
of just idly staring at it.  Make exercise something you don't have to think
about, just a  byproduct of something you happen to enjoy doing. 
<br><br>
As long as you do them consistently, these short bursts of physical exertion
will boost your energy, decrease stress and improve your overall health.
  And it will seem like you got fit in the blink of an eye!

Chamomile tea is not only great for relieving tension, but for wiping it off

chamomile tea several times a week to bring a soft, healthy glow to the skin.

<title> HEALTH BASICS</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2><b> HEALTH BASICS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>

With so much information out there on staying well, its easy to get a bit
overwhelmed. What vitamins to take?  What to eat and what to avoid?  How much
exercise?<BR>
Herewith, a few basic rules to keep you sane:
<P>
1) When it comes to eating, eat those foods that as close to their natural
state as possible.  This doesn't necessarily mean "raw"; rather, choose
actual fruit instead of "fruit flavored"; organic meats and dairy, instead of
the hormone-treated kind; brown rice versus white; whole wheat breads instead
of refined white breads. 
<P>
 Some macrobiotic practitioners suggest that we only eat foods that are
native to the region we live in.  For example, people in Vermont shouldn't
eat oranges.  While that idea may seem extreme for some, people of different
ethnic backgrounds may indeed have certain specific dietary requirements.  
Northern Europeans need more protein, while Asians do well with more
starch.  Take a look at the kind of diet your ancestors had and go from
there.
<P>
2) Take supplements. We don't get enough nutrients from the food we eat, so
its wise to have a "backup."  Antioxidants are particularly important.
   Avoid too much iron, however--in excess amounts it can contribute to
cancer and heart disease.
<P>
3) You've heard it before:  exercise.  But make it fun and rejuvenating, not
torture. Keep trying until you find something you like to do.  And don't take
an "all or nothing" approach.  Do what you can, as regularly as you can.
<P>
4) Manage your stress.  Be sure to take time off to defuse.  Get enough
sleep.  Don't allow situations to rule the way you respond to life.
<P>



5) Think of your life as a spiritual journey, one in which you're constantly
learning.  Consider what makes you happy and do it; don't just be a slave to
a paycheck.  Learn to have fun with life.

<p align=center><h2><b> LOOK INTO YOUR EYES</b></h2>
<hr noshade>

   
You may see bloodshot eyes as a sign of not enough sleep or too much
partying.  But those little lines may be a roadmap to other ailments in the
body.
<P>
A diagnostic technique called "sclerology" studies the white of the human eye
(or the "sclera"), on  the premise that all nerves in the body channel
through the optic nerves to blood vessels in the sclera ("iridology", on the
other hand --or eye-- studies the iris and is somewhat more complex).  
<P>
Sclerology has been part of Native American and Chinese folk medicine for
years.
It entered the modern wellness lexicon in the 60's after biochemist Stuart
Wheelwright learned the techniques from a Blackfoot medicine man.  He went on
to study literally thousands of people and establish a system.  Sclerologists
believe that the shape, size and placement of dilated blood vessels in the
eye indicate various health problems.  A straight line, for example,
represents stress, while a forked one indicates toxicity.
<P>
Sclerology still has many skeptics; but those who practice it claim that it
is an excellent "early warning system", alerting you to problems before they
become full-blown diseases.  Treating whatever problems are spotted usually
involves a regimen of herbs, vitamins and homeopathic remedies.   While some
health practitioners still scoff at its efficacy, proponents claim it has an
extraordinarily high predictive rate...and may be worth looking into to.

<p align=center><h2><b> WAKE UP!!
</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<P>
Find yourself dragging in the afternoon?  Unable to concentrate but  still
have a stack of work left to do before quitting time?  Here are a few ways to
perk up without inhaling a gallon of coffee.
<P>
First, try and expose yourself to the brightest light possible.  Take a walk
outside for a few minutes, or sit by a sunny window.  Temperature also makes
a difference.  The cooler a room, the more alert you'll feel, so head towards
a fan or open the window if you're fading.
<P>
Some Japanese office complexes have taken to pumping the aroma of citrus or
spearmint through their ventilation systems because these two scents have a
proven ability to increase alertness.  Try putting a drop or two of these
essential oils on a light bulb (turn it off first!) or in a small open dish
to freshen the air.
<P>
Turn on a radio.  The irregular beat of music is an instant pick me up
 (while you're at it, get up and shake your body to one or two songs to get
the blood pumping!). Also try stimulating your brain for a few minutes by
playing a video game on your computer.
<P>
Use your lunch hour differently.   Pass up a big meal and use the time for a
walk or workout: the exercise will keep your energy up all afternoon.  As far
as eating, opt for "grazing" your way through the day instead -- eat
something small every couple of hours.  This keeps your blood sugar steady.
<P>
And if all else fails...go ahead with the coffee!
<P>

<title> ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR ACNE

<p align=center><h2><b> ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR ACNE

</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<P>
Pimples are one of the most frustrating aspects of teenage life, and one that
can pop back up when you're an adult.  The typical route for treatment is
often antibiotics, birth control pills (for women) and topical skin
medications.  Yet many of these options  may only have short-term effects and
may create other problems over time.
<P>
Antibiotics, for example, can wipe out the friendly bacteria in your
digestive system, opening the door for yeast infections.  Benzoyl peroxide,
the most common ingredient in over-the-counter skin lotions, may be too
drying for some.  While benzoyl peroxide is considered safe by the FDA, they
are investigating the claims of several Japanese studies that say it promoted
skin tumors in mice exposed to ultraviolet rays.
<P>
Acne is caused when an overabundance of oil is produced beneath the skin
(usually a result of hormone imbalance).   Simply described, the excess oil
starts to break through the skin and  joins with bacteria.  The bacteria then
breaks down the oil and creates a pus-filled sac: your garden-variety pimple.
 <P>

Diet may contribute to the problem, though not in the ways you've probably
heard.  Chocolate and caffeine, for example, are labeled the usual culprits,
but there is no firm proof that they cause breakouts in everyone.  What may
contribute is a diet high in sugar and refined flours; these substances can
suppress the immune system, which could otherwise be fighting the bacteria
that contributes to pimples. 
<P>
Besides contributing to the oil problem, animal fat, like that found in fried
foods and red meat,  contains a substance that contributes to skin
inflammation.   A balanced vegetarian diet is higher in "good" fatty acids
that are less likely to clog pores, and the fiber that helps eliminate excess
hormones which promote excess oil production.  
<P>
Certain vitamin and mineral supplements can improve skin health; just be
careful not to overdo the recommended daily dosage, as some can be toxic in
high doses.  Beta-carotene (20,000 IU) and vitamin E  (400 IU) are a safe,
effective way to get and metabolize the vitamin A that reduces oil
production.  Zinc (25 mg) helps strengthen the immune system and heal acne
scars, while chromium picolinate (150 mcg) may help make better use of the
body's essential fatty acids.   B-complex (25 mg) helps breakdown excess
hormones, and selenium (150 mcg) helps control inflammation.
<P>
Since the liver supports the immune system, herbs that strengthen that organ
are good for the skin,  Try two capsules daily of dandelion root, milk
thistle or burdock root, taken alone or in combination.  Poor digestion can
allow unfriendly bacteria and toxins to flourish; herbs like gentian and
skullcap soothe the stomach.  Take one to two capsules three times a day with
your meals.  After a few months, your skin should begin to clear up at which
point you can ease up on the herbs.
<P>
Through a consistent regimen of good diet and herbal treatments, you should
be able to give acne problems the "all clear."

<p align=center><h2><b>FOOLPROOF WEIGHT LOSS
</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<P>
If you want to lose weight forget the dieting.  Well, sort of.  While losing weight does involve cutting back on calories you consume you also have to burn more. That's why dieting alone will never lead to permanent healthy weight loss.  To lose it, you've gotta move it..

<P>Exercise is the most important component for any weight loss plan, yet its the one we tend to overlook.  After a workout, your body continues to burn calories for several hours.  So even if you're just sitting there watching "Friends", you're reaping the benefits of that power walk you took before dinner.  Pretty good payoff for the time investment, huh?
 

<P>	Exercise changes your body composition.  When you just cut calories, your body hangs onto its fat because it goes into starvation mode.  Any weight loss therefore comes from losing lean muscle tissue.  But, if you add exercise, almost 100% of the weight lost will be fat.   On top of that, lean muscle burns 50 times more calories than fat does:  build it up and use it to your advantage!
<P>
You don't necessarily have to set aside an hour or more every day to exercise:  cut your workout into manageable pieces; a 30-minute walk, for example, can become 3 ten minute walks.   Do everything you can to fit more activity into your day:  take the stairs, do jumping jacks during TV commercials, park your car far from the grocery store and hoof it through the parking lot.  

	<P>To build the lean muscle that burns those calories off faster, add some strength-training to your routine, either with free weights or a machine. Remember two things, though: 
<P>1)	Muscle weighs more than fat, so the scale may not register a big loss 			BUT
<P>2)	Muscle is more compact than fat, so it take up less space (meaning:  your pants will 	finally zip without you losing consciousness from holding your breath).

<P>So if you're looking to shed fat faster, skip the diets and get moving!

The volatile oils found in lavender are great for repelling bugs, especially mosquitoes.
Try dabbing a tiny amount of lavender essential oil on your arm before venturing outdoors.
[Because essential oils are so potent, test yourself for any allergic reactions.  Pregnant women should not use essential oils.]  Lavender compresses have also been used in many European countries to soothe any bites from the little critters, because of their antibacterial properties.

The idea is that as the energy flows freely, the body will heal itself from everyday stress.  Potential illness will be staved off, since all systems are working harmoniously. Think of it as "tuning up" your energy system, with the hands of the practitioner serving as jumper cables.<P>For almost 1200 years, the art of jin shin was lost.  It was not until the early 1900's that this subtle method of rejuvenating touch was rediscovered in Japan.   With all the stress of modern life, jin shin is particularly suited to replenishing lost energies and providing relief from things like neck and back pain, insomnia, PMS, immune system problems, headaches, PMS and depression.<P>In a session,  which lasts about an hour, you lie on a table fully clothed.  The practitioner first "listens" to your pulse by holding both wrists.  This indicates which areas of your body are weak and need balancing.   He/she then "holds" particular pressure points (through your clothes): a spot on your shoulder together with one on the opposite knee for example.  These spots correspond to specific areas in your body.  The touch is gentle, steady and never involves force.  It's generally pain-free:  any tenderness in a particular area is caused by a blockage and tends to dissipate as the area is held.<P>Jin shin advocates self-help.  Between sessions,  many of the "holds"  can be done on yourself for general well-being.  Fingerholds are easy to do:  gently hold the appropriate finger on either hand,  allowing negative attitudes to melt and physical symptoms to ease: <BLOCKQUOTE>	<BR><B>THUMB:</B>	Corresponds to worrying, depression, anxiety.  Physical symptoms may 		be stomach aches, headaches, skin problems and nervousness.	<BR><B>INDEX FINGER:</B>  Corresponds to fear, mental confusion, frustration.  Physical 			symptoms are digestive problems and muscle problems like backaches.	<BR><B>MIDDLE FINGER:</B>  Corresponds with anger ("give someone the bird"), irritability, 		indecisiveness.  Physical symptoms are eye or vision problems, fatigue, circulation 		problems.	<BR><B>RING FINGER:</B>  Corresponds with sadness, fear of rejection, grief, negativity.  Physical 		symptoms are digestive, breathing or serious skin problems.	<BR><B>LITTLE FINGER:</B>  Corresponds with overdoing it, insecurity, effort, nervousness.	Physical symptoms are bone or nerve problems, sore throat.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>While our western society is conditioned to view physical work as effective only if it's vigorous, jin shin is extremely subtle.  In fact, you may wonder if anything is happening at all.   Practitioners say that individual reactions vary and suggest a minimum of three sessions to see if jin shin jyutsu is a useful addition to your personal wellness regimen.	<p>   <br> <hr noshade><br>Visit our <a href="../../video.html">Video Catalog</a><p><a HREF="../../news.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="../../gifs/arrow2.gif" ALIGN=middle>Newsletter Page</a><br><a HREF="../../index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="../../gifs/arrow.gif" ALIGN=middle>Wellspring's Homepage</a></body></html>

It's doing something just for fun, with the only goal being pleasure.  Liming is an extremely healthy habit to get into, because it allows you to return to your usual hectic pace with better judgement, fresh perspective and more energy.<P>Not all of us, of course, can wing off to Jamaica to hang out in a hammock.  But you can take mini vacations during the day that will do wonders for your outlook.  If you have a problem "allowing" yourself mental playtime, look at it as a way to improve your memory.  Your brain requires breaks every now and again to sort the information absorbed in past hours. <P>The trick is not to look at liming as "time out" -- this implies you're still watching the clock.  Rather, consider it "time off" and do something that lets you slow down and forget your normal pace for awhile.  It could be as simple as reading the comics and sipping tea.  You could put your feet up and stare out the window or visualize yourself at a favorite spot on the beach.  Listen to music, call a friend or watch a sunset.   Bake a loaf of bread or spend time in your garden. Shift away as much as possible from normal pressures and allow your brain to reset itself.<P>If you think it's somehow noble to keep gutting your way through piles of work, even when your brain or body is fried, remember the words of the Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu:  "All action begins in rest...This is the ultimate truth."

<title> PERFECT SCHMERFECT </title>


</HEAD>


<body bgcolor=#ffffff>


<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">


<p align=center><h2><b> PERFECT SCHMERFECT


</b></h2>


<hr noshade>


    


<P>


			




<P>Have your friends stopped asking you out to dinner because you can never
decide what you want to eat? Do you agonize over that budget report,
constantly making corrections and changes?  Do dinner parties throw you into
a frenzy of wild-eyed planning that would make Martha Stewart throw in the
Irish linen towel?  You're not nuts -- you're just a perfectionist. 

<P>On some level, perfectionism may seem like a virtue, but it's really a form
of obsessive behavior.  Psychologists define it as a neurotic need to avoid
all errors and mistakes; subsequently, you miss out on a lot of life's
imperfect pleasures.   And how do you separate perfectionism with the pursuit
of excellence?  Those who seek excellence set attainable goals and focus
their attention on the things in life that really matter to them.  Those who
seek perfection endlessly pursue unrealistically high standards, and rarely
enjoy them on the rare occasions they may actually attain them.
 <P> Perfectionists aren't satisfied unless everything in their life is
flawless, from their ironing to performing brain surgery.  Which do you think
deserves the most attention?

<P>The need for perfection masks a fear of  rejection, criticism, making
mistakes or bad decisions.  With these kind of hobgoblins, its no surprise
that perfectionists are also major procrastinators and avoid trying new
things.   How can you break the perfection habit and enjoy more of life?

<P>First,  become aware of your perfectionist tendencies.  Think about what
perfection is costing you in time, strained relationships and sleepless
nights.  Then aim for "average" performance.  Lower your  "A+" standards to
"B-minus" level and force yourself to reach only that level.  You may be
surprised at how good your work is and how much more you get done when you
don't waste so much time on petty details.




<P>Set -- and meet-- deadlines for yourself.  If you find yourself getting
sidetracked by anxiety and wasting time on minor details, take a deep breath
and re-focus your energies on the goal.    Break a big, seemingly
overwhelming project into several little ones.  Those little achievements
will add up to a major accomplishment.

<P>Lastly, force yourself to take risks every so often. Remind yourself that all
anyone can do is give a new experience their best shot.  It may not be
perfect, but it will be much more satisfying.

<title> MASSAGE AS  GOOD MEDICINE </title>

<p align=center><h2><b> MASSAGE AS  GOOD MEDICINE


</b></h2>


<hr noshade>


    


<P>


			

<P>A good rubdown is a sensuous and relaxing treat, but it may also have very
real healing benefits.  Some research shows that the kneading and pressing of
muscles not only significantly reduces stress levels and anxiety, but also
helps premature babies gain weight, eases insomnia, and helps psychologically
disturbed individuals.

<P>For example, one study had 30-minute back massages given to kids with
psychiatric problems.  Their anxiety and depression were reduced
dramatically.  High- risk preemies who received daily stroking gained weight
47 percent faster than those who didn't.  Patients enduring the pain of
surgery seemed to heal much faster when receiving massages before and after
the procedure. And in the workplace, stressed-out executives who were given
short upper back massages performed better on math tests given immediately
afterwards.

<P>No one understands exactly why massage is so therapeutic.  From a muscular
standpoint, it's been theorized that circulation is increased to the muscles,
joints and ligaments refreshing them with new blood, yet there is no
quantitative proof of this.  

<P>When it comes to the more dramatic benefits of massage one theory is that
massage may stimulate the vagus nerve, the most complex of the cranial
nerves.  Therapeutic touch affects the branch of the nerve that runs between
the brain and the heart, and may inhibit the release of stress hormones like
cortisol and epinephrine.  Another branch runs to the stomach, where touch
stimulates absorption of food and the release of insulin.

<P>Think you'd like to incorporate massage therapy into a medical treatment?
 You'll have a better shot at getting it covered by insurance if your doctor
prescribes a set number of treatments and  precisely states the desired
outcome. Check out the American Massage Therapy Association to find a
qualified practitioner in your area.

<P>No matter what your reason is for getting one, massage is sure to rub you the
right way.

<P>An apple a day really will keep the doctor away!  A Canadian study showed
that the fruit has penicillin-like properties:  fresh apple juice or apple
sauce rapidly destroyed stomach flu and polio viruses.  Eating a slice or two
of apple immediately after a meal also dramatically reduced instances of
cavities.

<P>
				

Even though Mom always told you to drink your milk, does doing so give you stomach cramps later on or leave you feeling gassy and bloated?  Then you may be one of the millions of people who are "lactose intolerant."  
<P>
It’s estimated that anywhere between 25 and 50 million Americans suffer bouts of this intestinal assault.  Native Americans, Asians, Africans and half of Hispanics are particularly sensitive to it.  This is because, after infancy, they have little "lactase", a digestive enzyme that breaks down the sugars in milk.
<P>
Lactase is also depleted in many people through age, digestive disease and chemotherapy.
<P>
Sensitivity to dairy foods is not in itself dangerous and can be managed by sensible eating.   Try consuming smaller amounts of dairy, always with food.  This will slow down the rate at which your stomach empties, and reduce or  prevent symptoms. Also try gradually increasing your intake of dairy foods, but avoid combining them at a single sitting.
<P>
Fermented products such as yogurt, buttermilk and hard cheeses are generally more tolerable.  They often don’t have as much lactose as other dairy foods;  Swiss cheese for example, only has trace amounts. Yogurt contains organisms that handily produce the lactase to digest the tummy-irritating lactose.  Frozen yogurt, however, loses these helpful organisms. 
<P>
Eating full-fat dairy products sometimes helps, as the fat may slow the passage of lactose through the system.  And good news for chocolate fiends:  cocoa powder may reduce the symptoms because it also slows the rate of digestion, so if you crave milk, bring on the hot chocolate! 
<P>
If simple dietary changes don’t work, check out lactose-reduced products or lactase tablets; that should allow you to make friends with the milkman again.
<P>

It used to be called "laying on of hands."  These days it goes by the fancier moniker of "therapeutic touch", and is causing quite a stir in medical circles for its old-fashioned ability to help heal. 
<P>
Like so many alternative bodywork methods, therapeutic touch, or "T.T.", is based on the idea of universal energy.  The human energy field radiates out from the body anywhere from two to six inches, constantly interacting with the environment.  When the body is injured, ill or upset, the energy flow is disturbed or blocked.   A practitioner of "T.T." is sensitive to these changes:  he or she may feel cold, heat, tingling, congestion or weakness emanating from areas of the body.   They move their hands through the flow of energy in a flicking, weaving or stroking motion in order to balance out these areas.  Generally, the practitioner doesn’t touch the patient, but simply moves their hands over the (fully-clothed) body to sense areas that require help.   Sometimes they give a light massage as part of the process which lasts anywhere from five minutes to a half hour.
<P>
The most immediate benefit of "T.T." is the immediate relaxation response that it induces, which makes it particularly effective in helping treat stress-related disease or injury, or calm those distraught from surgery or an accident.  It’s also been shown to speed up the healing process (which has gotten the attention of the health care industry).  Practitioners are quick to point out, however,  that therapeutic touch is a complement to conventional medical care, not a substitute.
<P>
At least 200 hospitals around the country currently have one or more nurses trained in the practice of healing touch (you can request a session through the hospital’s nursing supervisor).  Yet "T.T." is something anyone can learn. In a way, it is almost an extension of the intuitive acts each of us perform when someone is in pain:  holding a hand, stroking a feverish forehead.  The difference is in the spiritual and emotional attitude of the practitioner:  they consciously "center" themselves, set aside their own agenda and focus on becoming a conduit for healing energy.
<P>
Private treatments cost between $30 and $75; you can find a practitioner either through Nurse Healers-Professional Associates or through a holistic center in your area.   Why it works is still a mystery.  But the art of therapeutic touch has true "heal appeal."

<title>	Dry-Cleaning Dangers
</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2> Dry-Cleaning Dangers
</h2>

<hr noshade>
<P>
Did you bring home a load of freshly dry-cleaned clothes this week?  Then you may also have brought home headaches, nausea and an increased risk for cancer.

<P>Most dry-cleaners rely on a chemical solvent called perchloroethylene, or "perc".  This highly toxic carcinogen has been shown to have harmful effects on the nervous system and all major organs.  The maximum safe level of perc is 100 parts per million; however, one study measured 350 parts per million inside a car just fifteen minutes after a typical order of dry-cleaned clothes had been placed in it.

<P>Perc residue from freshly cleaned clothes can cause throat, eye and nose irritation.  Lower levels, like those found in a closet containing dry-cleaned clothes, can affect your mood, memory and coordination.
<P>So what are your options?  Believe it or not, many fabrics that say "dry clean only" don’t require it.  Manufacturers often put it on the label to prevent liability because they must accept the return if a garment shrinks or loses its shape.  Dry cleaning has long been the only guaranteed method of cleaning that prevents this, so clothing manufacturers get "label happy."

<P>In many cases, you can safely handwash "dry clean only" items (silk and rayon tend to do the best, while wool is not a good bet).  The typical rules apply: hand wash or use the delicate cycle; use cool water and keep colors separate; gently squeeze out the excess water and lay flat to dry.  You’ll probably have to run a warm iron over the garment to get the wrinkles out afterwards.

<P>Another option is new method of professional cleaning called "wet cleaning".  It’s a high-tech combo of hand washing, spot cleaning, steaming and washing that’s as effective as dry cleaning and costs the same.  Check around to find a firm that does this or encourage your local cleaner to take it up.

<P>Other things you can do to cut down on your dry cleaning are:

<P>1)	Brush your clothes with a lint brush to remove surface dirt and lint.

<P>2)	Hang them in the bathroom while you shower.  The tiny water 		particles will penetrate the fabric and help remove dirt and odors 		without affecting the shape of the garment.

<P>3)	Hang clothes outside on a sunny day for an outdoor air 		freshening.

<P>Because there will always be some clothes that  require dry cleaning processes, cut down on any after- effects by taking them out of the plastic bag as soon as you get home and hanging them outside or in a ventilated area for awhile before wearing them.

<title>Natural Help For Hair Loss
</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2> Natural Help For Hair Loss
</h2>

<hr noshade>
<P>
The typical adult has about 100,00 hairs on their head -- but some people may find them disappearing at an alarming rate.   While some cases of hair loss are hereditary and there’s not much you can do about it (minoxidil is the only drug approved for treating hair loss, but it doesn’t work for everyone), many people experience occasional times where more hair seems to end up in their brush than usual.  Those instances may be related to diet, stress or other factors. Try the following tips to get those little guys out of the sink and back on your head where they belong:
<P>
1)	An aromatherapy massage.  Stimulate your scalp by adding six drops each of bay and lavender essential oils to four ounces of warm almond or sesame oil. Gently massage into your scalp for three minutes and let it absorb for 20 minutes.  Then wash with your regular shampoo to which you’ve added 3 drops of bay essential oil.
<P>
2)	Check your diet.  For women, hair loss may be tied to digestive problems:  not absorbing enough protein, zinc or other minerals, for example.  Taking two nondairy powdered acidopholus tablets after each meal for a month or so may help.  
<P>
It may not stop it altogether, but for men, a low-fat diet may slow down hair loss. One theory suggests that higher testosterone levels -- a result of a high fat diet that includes animal products -- may be connected to pattern baldness.  Researchers note that baldness was a rarity among Japanese men prior to World War II; however, once their diet became more Westernized, baldness became far more commonplace.
<P>
Naturally, if your hair loss is rapid or tied to other health problems, you should see a doctor.   Otherwise, these "hair-raising" tactics may just do the trick!

<p align=center><h2>  Do The "30" Check

<P>
Most of us routinely eat the same foods day after day.  Not only is that boring, you also miss out on many nutrients.  The Japanese government urges its citizens to eat 30 or more different kinds of food each day--doing
<P>so goes a long way to ensuring better nutrition.  Keep a check list of your meals and snacks from the last week; how close did you come to 30 different foods?  Then investigate the variety of fruits and vegetables that are in season; check out exotic grains, like buckwheat, couscous and barley or other sources of protein like tempeh and seitan.  Become an explorer in your grocery store!  Your reward will be more energy and better overall health.

<P>Everyone knows the drill about wearing sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun while outdoors. While it's important to use sunscreen for prolonged exposure, taking five minutes a day to bask without it can boost your mood, help you sleep and add to your body's vitamin store.  

<P>The sun is vital to our inner "circadian" rhythms.  It helps to wind our body's clock and provides cues that let the brain know when its time to sleep later on in the day.  Sunlight also helps our body make Vitamin D, which helps bones and blood.

<P>Spend no more than five minutes outdoors during non-peak hours (before noon or after 3 p.m.) soaking up some rays.  Of course, slap on the SPF if you plan to be outside longer than that -- but a few minutes of sun time each day will brighten your outlook!

<title>Thomas Moore Page</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<center>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif"><h2>"SOUL" MAN <br>
Our Interview with Thomas Moore</h2><p>
</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Thomas Moore, the best-selling author of "Care of the Soul" and "Soul Mates," helps us find sacredness in everyday living:  in the reflection in a window, in a song, in the company of friends, even in the "meditation" of washing dishes.  He was recently featured in a special for Public Television, interviewed by writer Valerie Andrews.  Here are some excerpts that may help you care for your own soul. 
<p>
<b>Thomas Moore</b>:  I was very taken when I first began talking about care of the soul.  One night after a lecture in Boston,  a man came up to me and he said, "Is caring for the soul one more thing I have to do?"  He said, "I've done yoga.  I've followed a teacher from India.  I'm involved in fitness of all kinds.  Now I have to care for my soul?  Just too much." <p>

<b>Valerie Andrews</b>:  Kind of like flossing! <p>

<b>TM</b>:  It is like flossing.   You don't have time for it.  It's a burden.  But it isn't that at all.  A lot of this care of the soul has to do with the art of not doing so much, but behind that is something much deeper, and that is morality, or real ethics.  That morality becomes very individual and very demanding.  Actually, it is finally the voice of conscience. <p>


<b>VA</b>:  Normally, we judge ourselves pretty harshly and have a yardstick of perfection that we measure ourselves by.  <p>

<b>TM</b>:   I think that perfectionism is one of the great obstacles to living a life with soul.  The soul is almost by definition imperfect.  Part of living a soulful life is to come to appreciate ignorance.  The soul appears when there is space, when there is an opening.  One of the openings that we can make so the soul can come in is when we don't know something, when we don't know the outcome and we don't know what's going to happen next.  You 
take a leap.   There are so many things we don't know about, and to be able to live with that imperfect knowledge, I think, is a great way to invite soul into life.  The alternative is to be anxious and have to know everything -- take all kinds of workshops and courses and get degrees and certifications.  <p>

<b>VA</b>:  Has psychology also gotten into this domain saying that we can be fixed and we can be perfect beings? <p>

<b>TM</b>:  I think the idea that we can be perfect or that we can be fixed, repaired and improved is certainly implied in most psychology.   That is a problem because I don't think that we can pursue perfection and take care of the soul at the same time.  I think we would be better off enjoying the imperfect family, living the imperfect marriage and being in the job that is not the job you want to be in the rest of your life.  I think that's just human life, and anything else is an attempt to be superhuman, it's an attempt to be angels and not to be living a human life. <p>

<b>VA</b>:  You talk about three prescriptions for the care of the soul.  Can you tell us what those three are? <p>

<b>TM</b>:   The first thing, number one, always for me is not doing.  We have to find some way not to do so much.    We have to hollow out a space for the soul.  It might mean not reading the book that you should read, not taking a class that you really should go to, canceling your therapy hour for the day.  The whole thing in caring for the soul is to create space, to develop some emptiness so that the soul has a place to come in.  That's the secret about caring for the soul.  It's to invite it in, not to push it in, and shove it in, and demand that it be there, but find some way to open up the space. <p>
 
The second thing, I might say today, in caring for the soul is to realize how important images are in ordinary daily life.  Look around your house or wherever you live -- your apartment, your garden, your farm -- and notice if you feel an absence of imagery or color. It's not about introspection, trying to figure yourself out.  It's an art of making the world reflect and mirror and show us who we are and what the soul is.  <p>

Number three.   You have to have some kind of spiritual life.  I'm not saying you have to be a member of an organized religion or that there's any particular tradition, teacher or book.  That's not what I'm talking about.   We have to live that spiritual life which is ours -- somehow find some way to contemplate, to pray, perhaps, to find some imagery, poetry, paintings, sculptures, or some architecture that takes you to a place that is so much 
beyond yourself that it is part of your spiritual life.  We have to have an attitude toward things that we normally think of as secular like family or work or home and realize that these things are not ultimately secular things at all -- to be theologians in a certain sense of our own lives.

If you happen to see a bunch of people walking in circles, they may actually
be on a path of discovery.  "Walking the labyrinth" is an ancient spiritual
exercise that's suddenly become very modern.
<p>
A circular maze pattern is inlaid on a carpet,  stone floor, in a field or
even a garden.    Some even have reproduced the pattern on a large piece of
canvas that can be transported from place to place.   One steps onto the maze
and treads the twisting path, working always towards the center.  The whole
process takes about 20 minutes, and devotees say it focuses their mind and
puts them in touch with a higher spiritual connection.
<p>
Labyrinths are ancient designs that have been found in many cultures and many
places, from ancient Greece to the cathedral at Chartres, France.   Walking
the labyrinth is a symbolic journey which some scholars say became a
substitute for Christian pilgrims of old who were unable to make the real
journey to Jerusalem during the Crusades. 
<p>
The practice, however, has now cut across all religious and cultural
boundaries.  Modern-day pilgrims mostly find the focused "walking meditation"
a useful antidote to the pressures of the contemporary world.   Just don't
trip over your shoelaces.

Many experts recommend regular use of progressive muscle relaxation as a way
to help reduce stress.  "Spiral relaxation" is a form  that is very effective
in bringing a sense of calm and well-being to the body.
<p>
Lie comfortably on the bed or floor, palms facing upwards.  Close your eyes
and visualize a point of light that moves to make three clockwise spirals
around the body.  It will begin at the top of the head, move down to the face
and neck, then the upper chest, abdomen, waist, thighs, legs and feet.   
<p>
As the three spirals surround each part, consciously let go of any tension in
that area and completely relax.   
<p>
A variation of this exercise is to imagine the light entering your head,
gradually filling your whole body with warm healing light.  As it fills your
head, feel your face and jaw relax.    Allow this same feeling to encompass
the rest of the body, literally "melting" into the surface you're lying on.

When it comes to weight, fitness and health experts recommend not going by
what the bathroom scale says, but  rather how healthy we "feel."    Still,
most people need that little bouncing number to give them an indicator of how
they're doing size-wise.  Here are some tips to get the most out of the
weigh-in:
<p>
<ol>
<li> The best time to weigh yourself is first thing in the morning, right after
you get    out of bed (during the day, you accumulate fluids in your body).
You should    also go to the bathroom first, and weigh yourself naked to get
the most accurate    measure.
<li> Don't weigh yourself after working out.  It may look like you've lost some
pounds, but that's water loss---which comes right back after you drink up.
<li> Try and weigh yourself only once or twice a month, at the same time of
day.  Weight fluctuates for a variety of reasons, especially for women.
Obsessing over these ups and  downs can make you crazy.
<li> Don't weigh yourself after eating a big meal.  You're just weighing that
Chicken Kiev and mousse cake.
<li> Bathroom scales can be affected by moisture and temperature changes.   The
most accurate kind of scales are the kind at the doctor's office.
<li> Be realistic.   It may be physically dangerous to try and shrink down to
Kate Moss' weight if you're built more on the Roseanne side  ( we spell that
"e-a-t-i-n-g-d-i-s-o-r-d-e-r" ).  Remember too, that muscle weighs more than
fat.  So if you've been working out,  your scale may not reflect a huge drop
in pounds -- but you'll look  thinner.    And that's one instance in which
looks can be deceiving---in your favor!

Just like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", little blobs of fungus seem to be
everywhere these days, growing in kitchens and closets.  People make a drink
from the fungus and swear their health is better.  They're Kombucha
(kom-BOO-chah) mushrooms, and they're the latest "pet rock" in the health
industry.
<p>
Kombucha isn't really a mushroom at all.  It's a pancake-like culture of
yeast and bacteria (yummy!) that grows remarkably fast, floating in a mixture
of tea and sugar.  The mushroom is removed from the tea after a week to 10
days;   you strain and drink the liquid cold, which by now tastes like hard
apple cider.     The original culture has also by now made a "baby", which
devotees detach and give to friends to make their own tea.
<p>
Health claims for "kombucha tea" range from increased energy, weight loss,
curing acne, improved digestion, disappearing wrinkles, easing symptoms of
AIDS and just about everything else.     It contains gluconic acid, lactic
acid and B-vitamins, and 
<p>
appears to work primarily in the gastrointestinal tract.  Research is still
sketchy, but some think it allows the body to better absorb vitamins B and C.
However, the jury is still out for some experts.  While no adverse affects
have been reported, some warn that risk of contamination is high.  Others
counter that fear by pointing out the mushroom has such strong antibiotic
properties that it kills any harmful bacteria.
<p>
Of course, you don't have to make the tea in your own kitchen.  Bottled
versions (made in other people's kitchens) are popping up in health food
stores and there's even a rumor that Coca-Cola (originally touted as a health
beverage) may get in on the act.    Obviously, this is one magic mushroom.

When you just have to have a certain kind of food, your body may be telling
you more than just "feed me."  Cravings are often a clue that you have a
specific healh or nutritional need.  Here are some common ones:
<p>
SALTY FOODS: Your body's adrenal system may be off as a result of stress, or
you may have high blood pressure.  Better in the long run to try and
eliminate extra salt from your diet altogether (you can get plenty from fresh
vegetables).
<p>
SWEETS: If you're dying for chocolate, cola or ice cream, you want the quick
burst of energy that caffeine and sugar give you.  Chocolate, in particular,
releases a chemical in the brain that's similar to the one released during
sex (no wonder we crave it).  It's better to eat foods high in B-vitamins,
like liver, or whole grain breads and cereals.  They keep your blood sugar
stable .
<p>
CHEESE: You may need more calcium or phosphorous. It's easier (and lower in
fat and calories) to get it from raw vegetables.  
<p>
BANANAS:  Bananas provide potassium, a mineral you lose easily when you're
dehydrated or taking diuretics.

<h2><b> HEY,   WEIGHT UP! </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
One of the most overlooked aspects of fitness is weight training.  As far
back as the Greeks and Romans, working with weights was recognized as the
surest way to a  strong, sculpted body.    And it still is.  
<P>
Muscles make up about 45 percent of your body weight,  yet many people ignore
them  in favor of plain old aerobic exercise.  Combining aerobics with
alternate weight training  however, is far more effective in the long run.
When a muscle is toned, it's more efficient,  burning more calories and fat
even in a resting state.   That's because muscles that are being worked need
more energy to recover and repair themselves.   A fit, toned muscle burns
calories almost 20 times better than an untoned muscle.
<p>
Women who fear they'll bulk up through weights needn't worry.  Those oiled-up
female bodybuilders take their workouts to extremes, and reduce their body
fat to extraordinarily low rates most of us can't duplicate.   Just remember
the basic rule of thumb:  fewer reps with a heavier weight will enhance size
of a muscle;  more reps with a lighter weight tones it for a leaner
appearance.  
<p>
Give muscles 24 hours to recover after a workout.  Try working different body
parts on alternate days, or switch off between aerobics one day and weight
work the next.
<p>
When you get on the scale, you may find you haven't lost any weight, or maybe
even gained a few pounds.  Don't freak out:   muscle simply weighs more than
fat.  You'll  notice, however, that you look leaner and slimmer and feel
stronger and more energetic.  And that's worth weighting for.

<h2><b>FASTER  FITNESS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
We all know we're supposed to exercise, but for most people, time is a real
consideration.    Here are some ways to get the most for the least workout
time:
<p>
1) Exercising  aerobically for just 20 minutes a day, five times a week,
can still  provide significant fitness benefits.  
<p>
2) Don't  overlook the calorie-burning benefits of everyday activities like
vacuuming, cleaning the tub, walking an extra few blocks to work, or chasing
after a toddle.  Put a little extra "oomph" into these actions and they'll
contribute    to overall fitness.
<p>
3) The best exercise plan combines at least 15 minutes of aerobics with 15
minutes of strength training, five times a week.  You get more bang for your
time-buck, because aerobic activity boost the effectivenessmof strength
training    and vice-versa.  So you get in shape faster. 
<p>
4) Pay attention to your form.  Concentrate on working correctly and through
the    full range of motion.  Don't get sloppy.    Fifty stomach crunches
done slowly    and properly are more effective than 200 done at breakneck
speed.  You just    end up using other muscles to get through the motion, not
the one you're     targeting.    
<p>
5) When doing aerobic activity, boost it's effectiveness by incorporating
"interval    training."  Work at a harder intensity for two or three minutes,
then slow down to    your normal pace for two or three minutes.  Repeat the
process several times.

<p>
OK, OK -- you get points for doing regular exercise.  But besides buff biceps
and washboard abs, you might pick up a few unexpected "extras" -- like skin
rashes, calluses and strange fungal things.  
<p>
Athelete's foot spends more time in gyms than Schwarzenegger.  This itchy,
scaly fungus is commonly contracted by walking barefoot through gym locker
rooms or showers, so wear flip flops.    And be careful where your naked bod
brushes in that environment -- the fungus can be transmitted to other body
parts.
<p>
Warts are another nasty that can be picked up after sitting bareskinned in a
sauna or steambath.  Sit on a dry towel.
<p>
Unexplained rashes can be a result of makeup, deodorant or sunscreen mixing
with sweat. While sunscreen is vital for outdoor sports, use a waterproof
one.  In general, try to avoid putting extra lotions and things on your body
prior to your workout.
<p>
Always wear fresh workout clothes and change out of them as soon as possible
after you're done.  Sweaty clothes can cause inflamed hair follicles (they
look like acne).    If you're prone to these, use an antibacterial soap in
the shower and dust down with talcum powder to stay dry.

<title> CANDLE MAGIC</title>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<p align=center><h2><b> CANDLE MAGIC</b></h2>
<hr noshade>

Candles have been used for centuries for magic and rituals.   We blow them
out at birthdays and light them at holidays.  They invoke the divine, create
a sense of ceremony and are just plain pretty to look at.   Yet candles do
indeed have a special ability to make wishes come true, because they help
clarify your heart's desire and allow you to focus.   Next time you want to
make something happen in your life, let a candle light the way.  Here are a
few guidelines for making the magic happen:
<br><br>
1) You can use any kind of candle that appeals to you.  White is always a
good choice, but you may want to choose ones whose colors correspond to
specific energies.   Red, for example, connotes passion.   Green brings
growth and good health.  Yellow improves communication and blue creates
harmony and understanding.
<br><br>
2) Before using it, "dress" the candle by rubbing it with olive oil.  This
imparts your special energies to it and forges a psychic link.
<br><br>
3) Create an altar or special place where you can burn your candle and leave
it undisturbed afterwards.  You can add flowers, incense or other symbolic
items if you wish.  
<br><br>
4) Time your candle-burning to correspond to the cycles of the moon.  You can
find them out by looking on the weather page of your newspaper.  To bring
something into your life, do your rituals when the moon is waxing (or
growing).  To rid yourself of something, do it when the moon is waning.
<br><br>
5) Meditate briefly before lighting the candle to help still the mind and
bring your desire into focus.  When you light the flame, state your intention
out loud, in simple, clear terms.  Imagine that you already have what it is
you want in your life.  Watch the flame steadily, but don't stare intently.
 Focus on being receptive and open to what it is you want.
<br><br>
6) Let the candle burn as long as you want, but NEVER leave it unattended.
 Be sure to blow it out at the end of your session.
<br><br>
Repeat the ritual as often as you like, but don't get obsessive.  Candle
burning is a way to help you stay open to the possibilities of life.  It may
seem that your particualr wish didn't come true, but who knows? Maybe its
because something better is coming along.

<p align=center><h2>Fuel For A Workout
</h2>

<hr noshade>
<P>
What you eat and when you eat it can play a crucial role in your performance.  Make your next workout even better by fueling up beforehand with the right foods at the right time:
<P>
1)	Never eat a heavy meal right before a workout.  You should eat any big meal six hours before activity so that it has time to fully digest; then, just "top off" your liver and muscle reserves with a light snack of no more than 500 calories.  This will keep your blood sugar steady once you start to work out.  Avoid fats and heavy foods; they’ll just drag you down.

<P>2)	Eat oatmeal.  A big bowl of the stuff an hour before exercise has been shown to increase the duration of a workout.  High in fiber and low in sugar, it’ll keep your energy on an even keel.

<P>3)	Carb-laden sports drinks help endurance during long workouts of two hours or more, but are best for sports that are non-stop such as cycling or cross-country skiing.  If you stop to rest, the drink will cause your blood sugar to spike, then dip when you begin exercising again.

<P>Smart eating should make even the hardest workout "no sweat"!

<p align=center><h2> Fluid Check
</h2>

<hr noshade>

<P>When you're out jogging or playing tennis, the sweat  pouring off your brow is a good indicator that you're losing body fluids and need to swig some water.  But there are many other exercise occasions when your need for fluids is not so obvious.  Be aware of them, and drink up.

<P>Water, water everywhere and still, you're dehydrated.  <B>Swimming</B> feels cooling and refreshing but believe it or not, you also work up a sweat  It's just harder to feel it, especially if the pool is warm. In fact, the warmer the pool, the more you perspire.

<P>The air whizzing past your body during <B>biking or rollerblading</B> causes sweat to evaporate, so you don't feel hot.  But your body knows better.  The same goes for <B>winter sports</B>, like cross-country skiing. The frosty surroundings can fool you into thinking you're cool as a cucumber -- in reality, your body may be dry as the Sahara.

<P>Even if you're <B>just walking around</B>, you can lose up to three pounds of water in a hot environment and not even notice it. 

<P>Most of us don't drink enough water as it is.  At the point when you start to feel thirsty, you're actually well into the dehydrated stage.  Make your water bottle your best friend  and even if you don't think you need it, guzzle away during the day!

<title> EAT, DRINK....AND BE AWARE </title>

</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Hungry?  Are you sure  about that???One of the most effective ways to drop
pounds is to get in touch with your body's true hunger signals. 
<p>
Most of us eat for  reasons other than hunger;  boredom and habit are two big
culprits.  Or we overeat, never heeding the internal signal to "stop."
  Learning to determine true hunger will allow you to eat when your body
truly needs it,  stop when satisfied and maintain your natural weight without
obsessing about food.
<p>
Before you reach for the bag of Ring Dings, check these signals:
<p>
1) Is there a gnawing in your stomach?  That's hunger.
<br>
2) Are you queasy, light-headed or tired?  That's a sign of low blood sugar,
and a    sign your body needs nourishment.  Even if you don't "feel"
particularly hungry,    you should eat a little something to even things out.
<br>
3) Are you in the middle of doing something else when the thought of food
pops in    to your head?  That's an initial sign that you need to feed.
<p>
Conversely, these clues are not a sign of true hunger:
<p>
1) A growling stomach is just air passing through your intestines.
<br>
2) Cravings for a specific food tend to be emotion-based.  Real hunger
doesn't    demand a certain food over others.  By the way, cravings tend to
fade    after 20 minutes, so ride it out by occupying yourself with something
distracting.
<br>
3) The opportunity to eat something yummy knocks:  you pass a hot-dog, pizza
   stand  or bakery.  Suddenly, you feel an urge to eat.  Easy, kids-- it's
just     another craving (see #2).
<br>
4) You don't feel hungry, but you're eating anyway.  Food has become a
substitute   for something else.  Are you bored or lonely? What is it you
really want? 
<p>
The other hunger signal is knowing when to say "when."   Putting down the
fork often involves separating your head from your stomach.  Pay attention to
how your stomach feels before, during and after eating.  The object is not to
be "stuffed," but to find the level of fullness that's truly satisfying.
 Using the Tight Waistband Test or other outside gauges keeps you out of
touch with your own body signals.  Instead, slow down and pay attention to
how fast you're eating.  Since it takes about 20 minutes for the body to
register satiety, eat more slowly and consciously for a few weeks in order to
determine your own food shut-off point.
<p>
If you still don't feel satisfied after a meal, it could mean the meal wasn't
nutritionally balanced.  Ideally, each meal should provide protein, carbs,
some fat and a mix of tastes and textures.
<p>
So eat, drink, and be aware, and you'll be able to naturally reach your
body's ideal weight!

<hr noshade>
<p>
Give your body the right fuel at the right time, and you'll find your workout gets a real boost!  
<p>
Work out in the morning? Eat a light breakfast about a half-hour before starting. Fruit and a dry bagel is a good choice for replenishing blood sugar and keeping it level after a night's rest.
<p>
If you go for a mid-day or a late afternoon session, eat a snack one hour beforehand. Try crackers with low-fat cheese, an energy bar, yogurt or a piece of fruit.
<P>
For nighttime exercisers, eat your dinner one to two hours before. Focus on low-fat meals that will digest easily. Too much fat or sugar will just make you feel sluggish.
<P>
If you're among the more ambitious and work out twice a day, replenish your energy stores by adding a carb snack to your diet, about 30 minutes prior to your second workout.

<p>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Healthy relationships are vital to a satisfying life, but can be difficult to maintain in the face of real-life problems.  Since the '60's, almost 50% of married couples have opted out of the relationship within a few years -- with devastating emotional, financial and social consequences for everyone involved. 
<p>
Good news, though:  a recent <b>Time</b> Magazine report notes a concerted effort among churches, private counseling organizations and even -- gasp! -- divorce attorneys to get away from the "throwaway marriage" syndrome.
<p>
While not every relationship can or should be saved, the number of couples using some form of counseling to make their marriage healthier is up nearly 3 times from 15 years ago.   The most common areas of conflict are over money, household responsibilities and sex.   All require the same basic thing:  effective communication.
<p> 
Dr. Wendy LeDoux, a clinical psychologist and relationship counselor, says you shouldn't expect your partner to "guess" or "know"  what's bothering you.   Making needs known  and doing it in a non-threatening way is the secret.  <b>Don't  accuse</b>, by using phrases like, "You always..." or "you never..." <b>Be specific</b> about what you want or need, and start sentences with something like "I feel..."   
<p>
Listen to your partner.    <b>Don't interrupt</b>.   Even if you have to set a timer, allow your partner to have their say without jumping in to explain or defend.  Find a middle ground, elements you can agree on, and work from there.

<center><i>"If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will avoid a hundred days of
sorrow."</i>  -Tibetan proverb</center>
<p>
Anger is an extremely powerful emotion, which can have a negative impact on
our relationships and our health.  While some may think "venting" is
healthier than keeping anger in, studies show that both practices resulted in
a death rate two times higher than among those people who choose "reflective
coping."
<p>
Reflective coping just means waiting until you've cooled off, then rationally
discussing what has made you angry.  You acknowledge the anger, but you avoid
the hostility and abuse that can add guilt to the problem.
<p>
Next time you're about to blow, try the ACE method:
<ol>
<li> ASSESS ACCURATELY:    If you feel a fight brewing with someone, make sure
it's not just tension or frustration you're sensing.  Ask if something in
particular need to be discussed.     A lot of yelling escalates from
emotions, accusations and bad timing, moreso than real problems.
<li>CHOOSE CONSTRUCTIVELY:    Be careful with the words you use.  Don't use an
accusatory tone.   Be specific in the issues you're addressing.
<li>EXPRESS EFFECTIVELY:   Think for a second why you're angry. Don't focus on
who's "right" or" wrong";   find the way to make changes in the situation
that's upsetting you. 
</ol>

<h2><b>LEAVE IT AT THE OFFICE
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
</p>
<p>
Most of us are working harder and longer hours, and find it difficult to just
"let go" at the end of the workday.  You're still thinking of that project
that needs to be completed, the meeting tomorrow, those phone calls you
didn't get to.  Subsequently, your  down time at home with the family may
suffer.  
<p>
And yet psychologists note that time with family is crucial to a satisfying
life.  Here are a few ideas on how to "turn it off" at the end of the workday
and reconnect with your private life:
<p>
1) Use the last 15 minutes of the workday to do low-pressure tasks.  Clean
off    your desk,  return one or two calls to people you enjoy dealing with.
   More    importantly, take the time to plan and write down tomorrow's
tasks.  Trying to    remember them will just keep your mind preoccupied all
night.
<p>
2) Make a point of noticing the scenery on your journey home.  Smell the air,
   notice the trees or the sky.  It will help distance you from the workday,
relax you    and remind you of a larger perspective.
<p>
3) When you get home, don't immediately launch into a litany about how tough
  your day was.  Ask your family to also hold off on their demands for a few
    minutes to a half an hour.  Use this time to change clothes, take a
shower or a    walk, enjoy a cup of tea or a glass of wine.  
<p>
4) Establish rituals.  Simple things like family dinners have gotten lost in
today's    busy lifestyle.  Try to create "touchstones" at home that make you
all reconnect.     This can be sitting down once a week to a meal together,
spending an evening    together watching a certain show on TV, etc.
<p>
If you tend to be a workaholic -- and these days, it's difficult to avoid
overworking yourself -- remember the big picture.  Someone once said that,
while lying on their deathbed,  most of us probably won't wish they'd worked
harder.

<title>DISCIPLINING YOUR KIDS:  A CHECKLIST </title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>DISCIPLINING YOUR KIDS:  A CHECKLIST 
</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
</p>
<p>
Probably the trickiest area of parenting is disciplining your kids.    In her
new video, "Parenting for Today",  psychologist Dr. Lee Hausner offers some
tips:
<p>
1) Start young.  It's that much harder to impose discipline on a teenager
when    they didn't receive it earlier.  Once a child understands language,
they can    understand discipline.
<p>
2) Be specific.  Clearly define the behavior you expect, and state the
consequences if they break the rules.  ("If you break curfew, you won't be
allowed to go out the next weekend.")    Most importantly,  be consistent in
enforcing the consequences.
 <p>
3) Connect the consequence to the activity.  If your child doesn't put his
toys away when he's been told to, take them away for awhile.  For teens, loss
of    priveleges such as use of the phone or the car are effective
consequences.
<p> 
4) Choose your "A" list   Pick four or five major rules your kids must
follow.     Stick to what's really important, and don't sweat the type of
clothes they wear or    how loud they play their music.  Plus, don't overlook
the value of rewarding kids   when they cooperate with the rules.

<h2><b>TRUE BLUES 
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
</p>
<p>
"Every great mistake has a halfway moment, a split second when it may be
recalled and perhaps remedied."   - Pearl S. Buck
<p>
When it comes to love, you may have stars in your eyes, but don't have rocks
in your head  about the issue of fidelity.  It's probably the biggest
challenge in any relationship.   Clinical psychologist Dr. Wendy LeDoux
offers some insight on heading off temptation.
<p>
Quite simply, cheating happens because a partner's needs aren't being met.
They themselves may not even realize what those needs are; that's why an
atmosphere of open, honest communication is vital.  Each partner must feel
they can explore and air their darker side, emotions like guilt, anger or
resentment, without being judged by the other.  This is true intimacy.
<p>
As time goes on in a relationship, it's typical to take each other for
granted.  Subsequently, the basic need to feel special may make a partner
"emotionally available" for an affair.  Remember to regularly tell your
significant other that you love them or find them attractive;  don't "assume"
they know it already.
<p>
Remember what qualities attracted you to each other in the first place.   If
those qualities seem more like big "differences"  now,  turn them into
advantages for the relationship.   View them as adding a little spice to
things.
<p>
If an affair does occur, it doesn't spell the end of your relationship.
Focus on the cause, communicate with each other in an honest, direct way and
"try, try again".

<p align=center>
<h2><b>Going to Work...and Liking It
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Most people think work is something they "have" to do...and not something
they necessarily are supposed to like.  But considering how much time each of
us spends at our jobs each day, it's important to view our work as
contributing something meaningful to our lives.
<p>
The ideal situation, of course, is to do work you love.  If you have a job
that you would do even if you didn't get paid for it, consider yourself
fortunate.  For those who don't feel quite so charitable towards their
bosses, here are a few ways to shift perspective and make the workday more
rewarding.
<p>
1) View your company as a live organism to which everyone contributes and is
vital to its growth.  Just because someone works in the corner office
doesn't make them more important than the guy on the loading dock.  Zen
teachings state that manual labor is as vital to consciousness as meditation.
Monks incorporate daily "menial" tasks like scrubbing floors into their
training. 
<p>
2) Lighten up.  Try and find ways to make your job -- or parts of it-- fun.
Approach    tasks like play (why do you think so many executives have
basketball nets on    their trash cans?)
<p>
3) Create a sense of meaning by having a vision of what it is you do.
There's a    story of two men digging a ditch.  When asked what they were
doing, one    replied, "Digging a ditch."  The other replied, "Building a
cathedral."  It's all a    matter of perspective.
<p>
4) Remember the basics of honesty and empathy in dealing with others.   View
your interaction with people as a way to share and help.
<p>
5) Keep the rest of your life vital and active.  Maintain priorities like
family and    friends,  and realize you are more than the person behind the
desk, computer    terminal or cash register.

<title>SHOPPING FOR A THERAPIST</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>SHOPPING FOR A THERAPIST</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
There may be times in your life when an emotional crisis or behavior pattern
gets in the way of living a whole, fulfilling life.  Sometimes it may be
temporary, like the death of a loved one.  Other issues may be long-standing,
such as a pattern of consistently choosing an abusive partner.    At these
times, working with a qualified therapist can help immeasurably in reclaiming
your life.  Here are a few guidelines for finding the right therapist for
your needs:
<p>
1) Acknowledge that you need help.  This is the most difficult step.  If
you're not sure what to expect from therapy, check out  The Consumer's Guide
to Psychotherapy by Jack Engler, Ph.D. and Daniel Goleman, Ph.D. for answers
to common questions.
<p>
2) Identify the specific problem you're facing.  Make a list of what it is
you need to talk about with a therapist:  getting over a bad relationship?
The death of a loved one?  A divorce?   Different problems have specific
approaches to treatment.
<p>
3) Get referrals for several therapists.   Check the phone book for national
professional associations, such as The American Psychiatric Association.
They will provide referrals near you, and can match you with the kind of
therapy that will be most beneficial.  Also check with friends, relatives or
leading figures in the field, such as the head of psychiatry at a local
hospital.  Self-help organizations are another good source.  For example,
Alcoholics Anonymous would most likely know someone in the area that
specializes in therapy related to alcohol abuse.
<p>
4) Request an initial consultation.  This is a no-obligation opportunity to
see if the you and the therapist are a "good fit."    It's a good idea to
meet with at least three professionals before making your decision.  Ask what
their strategy for treatment is, length of treatment,  payment options.  Do
you feel comfortable?  Can they provide a safe, confidential atmosphere?  Are
they honest, non-defensive and empathetic?  
<p>
5) Contract for therapy.  After you've selected the therapist, the two of you
should agree on specific goals for treatment and how you will work together
to reach them.  This is also the time to work out details on payment and
billing.  
<p>
Don't feel as if there's something "wrong" with you if you require therapy.
Rather than burying your emotions, asking for help is a sign that you choose
to be a whole, healthy person.

<title>LIFE-CHANGING DECISIONS</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>LIFE-CHANGING DECISIONS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
It's no surprise most of us agonize over life's bigger issues;  it's hard
enough deciding what to have for dinner.  Switching careers, leaving a
relationship, starting over....these are the kinds of issues that make for a
nagging feeling in the back of our head that we "have to do something."   To
avoid addressing them because of their inherent riskiness is even more
draining,  as we end up denying our true potential.  Consider these points
next time you're faced with a heavy decision:
<p>
1) Always choose to grow.   The opposite of growth is stagnation and
    death.  Think about how changing your situation will help you to expand
your    human experience.
<p>
2) Opt to take risks.  Part of our reason for not taking risks is our fear
that we won't    be able to handle what results --good or bad.  After
weighing all your options,    sometimes you have to jump and trust that your
inner parachute will open. 
<p>
3) Believe you can change.  Don't think you "can't"  because "your situation"
won't    allow for it.  Change is inevitable -- take control of that factor.
<p>
4) Be open to unusual alternatives.  If you really want to work in the Cuban
sugar    cane fields, don't dismiss it because it's not a "normal" job.
What's      ultimately important is what makes you happy; don't let pressure
to conform    affect your decision.
<p>
5) Are you pursuing your dream.... or someone else's?  Do you really like
being a    tax lawyer?  Or did your father always want to be a tax lawyer?
 If you're     unhappy about some aspect of your life, check to see if it's
because you're    living out someone else's fantasy.
<p>
6) Realize you always have a second chance.  So what if your "dream job"
    doesn't work out?   Maybe it wasn't for you after all.  Take your
blinders off and    remember there are many options in the world. Criminals
get a second chance    (and sometimes their own talk show)....why not you?

<title>WHEN YOUR INNER CHILD IS AN OUTER BRAT</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>WHEN YOUR INNER CHILD IS AN OUTER BRAT</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
You've probably heard the term "inner child" a lot lately.  It's the newest
way to define the emotional baggage we've all carried around since...well,
since we were kids. 
<p>
We each have many different sides:  the grown-up side, the professional side,
the childlike side.  However, the way we feel emotionally doesn't change.
 The frustration we felt as a two year old is the same frustration we feel at
forty-- we just cover it up and express it differently.   We may sink into
feelings of hopelessness, overeat, drink too much or lash out at loved ones.
<p>
Your inner child hauls around a red wagon full of memories of every hurt,
frustration, and pain you've ever experienced.  He or she doesn't understand
the incidents and doesn't know that time has passed;  they just know they
still hurt.  As adults, we tend to rely on rational thought to control these
painful memories and emotions.  However, emotions are far more powerful than
logic. The more we deny them, the stronger they get.  If you try to suppress
them, your inner brat will just yell louder.   Kids "act out" in two basic
ways:  they scream until they get attention or they withdraw and wait for
help.  Which is your style?   Do you suddenly have outbursts of rage?   Or do
you lapse into depression?  These may be signals that something needs
attending to.
<p>
Find a picture of yourself, before the age of five.  Carry it with you, get
to know yourself at that age again.  This is your inner child.  This is
essentially who you still are, emotionally-speaking.  Learn to be a good
parent to this child of yours.  Pay attention to what they are telling you
and allow them to express their needs.  Don't automatically tell your child
to "be quiet" (suppressing your feelings);  don't just give in to their
demands that they taken care of right this minute, either (letting your
emotions control you).    Next time you find yourself "acting out",  listen
to what's going on inside of you, what your child is demanding.  Start
teaching your child (yourself) to express those feelings more appropriately
and to wait for the time when that can be done so.   A child must  be taught
that delayed gratification doesn't  mean "never."     If there's something
your inner child wants (and they want it now), patiently tell them they will
get it eventually.  When your inner child is demanding attention,  literally
say to yourself, "I know you're hurting.  I have something else to attend to
now, but I will deal with you in just a little while."  This sends a message
that you aren't ignoring them, but that the adult is in charge.  Just like a
good parent.
<p>
Remember too, that your inner child is not always a problem child -- he or
she is your source of playfulness, too. The more you comfort, nurture and
allow this childlike part of yourself to come out and play,  the more healthy
self-love and self-esteem you'll experience.

<p align=center><h2><b>RELATIONSHIP TIPS </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<p>
A healthy relationship is one of  the greatest  experiences you can have in life...and one of the most challenging.  Relationships force us to grow and learn about life and about ourself.   But because issues of self-esteem and self-worth are part of the package,  its easy to fool ourselves into thinking that a bad relationship is really a good one.   Make a quick check to see where things really stand with you and your partner:
<p>
Imagine a "relationship-o-meter": at one end of the meter is complete
narcissism.  One partner does nothing but take, always expecting their needs to be filled by the other. The narcissistic partner is self-centered and makes no attempt to meet their own emotional requirements when they can manipulate others to do it for them.  
<p>
At the other end of the meter is codependency, where one partner focuses
completely on caring for the other.  The codependent person lives in a
fantasy,  thinking that if they fulfill their partner's needs then the
partner will someday magically get around to meeting theirs.  It never
happens.
<p>
A healthy relationship lies balanced somewhere in the middle. There must be an equal amount of taking and giving between the two partners.  There must also be mutual respect and kindness.  Most importantly, there must be boundaries.  Recognize that your partner is a separate person with their own needs, values and choices to make.   There is a part of him./her that is distinctly separate from the relationship as well.   If you think you must have constant closeness, sharing and togetherness, you'll find things becoming suffocating and boring pretty quickly.

Relationships are a primary area for experiencing growth.  Its important that the relationship make you feel safe enough to express your feelings, make mistakes and be yourself.  Does yours provide that?  Or do you hide your feelings, afraid of what will happen? 
<p>
Remember  that no other person can make your life perfect.  All relationships -- good and bad -- are a reflection of the kind of relationship you have with yourself. If yours are unfulfilling, take a hard look at how you treat yourself and you'll get some startling clues.  Ultimately, the most important person you must learn to love is yourself.

<html><head><title>WALKING TALL</title></HEAD><body bgcolor=#ffffff><img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif"><p align=center><h2><b>WALKING TALL</b></h2><hr noshade><p>Walking seems like the simplest, most natural motion in the world.
 Low-impact, easy-to-do, it's the exercise choice of over 80 million
Americans.   But believe it or not, there are common mistakes that can
decrease it's effectiveness and lead to tension, low back pain and fatigue.
 Take steps to a better workout with this quick checklist:
<p>1) Good posture is critical.  Make sure your ears, shoulders, hips, knees and
   ankles are all aligned.
<p>2) Don't let your head droop; you risk straining your neck muscles. Your chin
   should be parallel to the ground, eyes focused 15 to 20 feet ahead.
<p>3) Overweight exercisers in particular tend to make their stance too wide,
which    causes the upper body to work against the natural stride and slows
you down.     Check your position by walking with your back to the sun, so
that your shadow    falls in front.  If your shadow sways from side to side,
narrow the width of your    stance.
<p>4) You might think you'll cover more ground by taking bigger strides, but
this puts    stress on the lower back and knees.  Keep your step natural: the
distance    reached when you move forward and your foot automatically goes
out to catch    you.  Avoid tilting forward as you walk;  some mistakenly
think this will give them   speed, but it also strains the lower back.  
<p>5) Letting your shoulders slump forward restricts  breathing and strains your
back    and upper body. Align them over your hips. Don't let them scrunch up
around    your ears; stay relaxed.
<p>6) If you speed-walk, don't do "chicken arms" (thrusting your elbows out to
the    sides).  This throws off your rhythm ,restricts breathing and creates
tension in    the shoulders.  Let your arms hang naturally and swing them
back and forth as    if they're in a groove.
<p>7)  Always wear an athletic shoe, not a street shoe, or you could be in for
foot pain.     The shoe should have a half to three-quarters of an inch of
padding in the heel,    and good arch support.  It should b flexible enough
to bend in your hand and    the toe box should allow for the expansion of the
foot during the normal step.
<p>8) Check the wear pattern on the bottom of your shoe to see how you're
landing.  If   you land with a flat foot, you hurt your knees.  If you walk
with toes turned out or    in, your ankles are at risk.  Land on your heel
and roll straight through the ball of   your foot to your toe.
<p>9) Forget the weights.  Walking with hand or ankle weights can throw you off
   balance, and strains the joints.  If you want to burn more calories, pick
up the    pace instead and walk for a longer time.

<title> ARTHRITIS HELP </title>


</HEAD>


<body bgcolor=#ffffff>


<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">


<p align=center><h2><b> ARTHRITIS HELP


</b></h2>


<hr noshade>


    


<P>


			



<P>One in seven Americans suffer from some form of arthritis.   Osteoarthritis
--the kind that causes stiffness and pain in fingers and the weight-bearing
joints of the knees, feet, hips and back is the most common form.  Arthritis
may start to show up around midlife and can become severe enough to warrant
invasive surgery. What can you do to ease the pain -- even halt the
progression of this disease?  Typical treatments involve analgesics like
Tylenol or anti-imflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  While they
may help, they may also irritate the stomach -- sometimes to the point of
bleeding.  Alternative treatments involving supplements, diet and exercise
are showing promising results with far fewer side effects:

<P>1) A major new study showed that taking antioxidants may reduce the
progression and occurrence of arthritis.  To alleviate the symptoms, you need
to take them in food and supplement form.  Experts suggest 200 to 400 IU of
Vitamin E daily, along with 500 to 1,000 mg. of Vitamin C three times a day
(you may want to gradually build to this dosage to give a sensitive digestive
system time to adjust).

<P>2) One recent study in Europe showed that the amino sugar glucosamine reduced
pain as effectively as ibuprofen.  Glucosamines are naturally occurring in
the joints and appear to turn up the body's healing process.  A daily dosage
between  .75 and 1.5 grams of glucosamine hydrochloride tablets is suggested
over four to eight weeks.

<P>3) Acupuncture has proven wonderfully effective in relieving arthritis pain
for many.  Volunteers who had two treatments weekly for eight weeks reported
moderate to marked improvement, and the results lasted even four weeks after
they had stopped.

<P>4) Creams containing capsacin (derived from cayenne peppers) are helpful when
 rubbed on the affected areas. 

<P>5) Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapples and can reduce inflammation.
Try 400 to 500 mgs. three times a day on an empty stomach.  Curcurmin,
another herbal anti-inflammatory,  is comparable to over-the-counter
medications in its ability to ease stiffness.  A recommended dose is 400 mgs.
three times daily.  Both of these supplements are available in health food
stores.


<P>7) A healthy, low-fat diet that keeps unnecessary weight off your joints is
vital.  Some experts feel that fruits and veggies in the nightshade family
 (tomatoes and eggplants) may increase arthritis symptoms.  Try eliminating
them from your diet.

<P>Exercise -- preferably the low-impact type -- is absolutely critical for
arthritis sufferers.  Nothing will make you suffer more than becoming
sedentary.  Keep moving and stretching to maintain your range of motion
...and keep stiffness on the run!

OK, which one of these lurks in your office? 'The Whiner,"  who complains about everything? Or maybe it's the "Know- It- All" holding forth in the coffee room. Maybe you have a "Tank" ruthlessly rolling over everyone who stands in her way? We all have to deal with people who are less than lovable. Here are some ways to make it easier:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>Don't take their behavior or words personally.  Chances are, they act the way they do with everyone. Taking their "slings and arrows" to heart only raises your defenses and can escalate a situation. Distance yourself from it by remembering that you're not the only one that thinks they're a (fill in the blank).
	<LI>Accept that you're helpless to change them. That in itself will provide some relief.
	<LI> Speak up...carefully. It's tempting to explode when someone is unloading on you, but hold your temper. Once you've identified what bothered you about the attack, address the values you feel were violated. Having the courage of your convictions will allow you to rise above the personal offense and handle the situation with more clarity and confidence.
	<LI>Find other ways to blow off the emotional steam.  If someone makes you want to scream--maybe you should. Allow yourself to get the anger out --privately -- then let it go. Write the person a letter expressing all your rage, then burn or  shred it. Pound a pillow (or yell into it). The point is to allow yourself a harmless outlet for the frustration.
	<LI>Define your boundaries. Clearly, let the person know exactly what you will and will not tolerate and why. If they know your limits, they may not be as likely to test them.
	<LI>Mix it up. If certain situations always seem to trigger the same annoying responses, change the environment. Have the meeting over lunch instead of in the boardroom. Drop by their office, rather than relying on a memo. Anything    that can shake them out of their habitual patterns may result in a more pleasant response.
	<LI> Kill them with kindness. The minute you react defensively, their aggression/annoyance level only increases.  Absorb what they dish out(without letting it affect you) and you'll disarm them.
	<LI> Show them you understand. Let them know they've been heard: summarize what they've said and repeat it back; ask questions for clarification or giving meaningful looks (or sounds if you're on the phone) to let them know you're listening.  Most of the time, that's all a difficult person wants  -- the sense that they've been heard and understood.

Relaxation techniques are being increasingly prescribed as a way to treat
that pain in your brain.   One headache clinic found that patients who
practiced relaxation regularly had 45 percent fewer migraines.  Practice this
exercise once a day, and you should have less pain:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Lie down in a dark, quiet room.
<li> Take slow, deep breaths, consciously relaxing your feet, ankles and so on
all the way up through your torso to your head and neck.
<li> Imagine a place that's tranquil (Bermuda's nice this time of day); focus
on that image for at least 5 minutes.

<h2><b>INSTANT MOOD LIFTERS
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
If you're feeling a little blue, don't  give yourself some phony pep talk
Have handy a list of positive actions you can take that will lift your
spirits.   After all, actions always speak louder -- and do more -- than
words. Here are some tried and true mood builders:
<p>
1) Take a quick walk.  Exercise, plus the fresh air, always has positive
affects on    the human spirit.
<p>
2) Spend a little time with a young child.  Their simple outlook on life is a
reminder    that things aren't as bad as you think.
<p>
3) Laugh.  Read a comedy column in the paper, have a book of favorite "Far
Side"    cartoons on your desk.  Learn to find the absurdly humorous in
whatever is    bothering you.   As someone once said, "Don't take life so
seriously, because    you never get out of it alive anyway."
<p>
4) Take a moment to walk in the other guy's shoes.  If someone has upset you,
think about the problems and sorrows in their life.  It won't cure your
depression, but it will allow for some perspective on the situation.
<p>
5) Pretend you're happy.  This may sound silly, but it works.  If you "act as
if", your body responds similarly.
<p>
In many instances, being happy or content is a matter of choice.  In the
words of American sociologist M. Kathleen Casey, "Pain is inevitable,
suffering is optional."

If you're feeling a little stressed or anxious, surround yourself with the
color pink.  Color therapy, like aromatherapy, is proven to have positive
effects on your mood.
Pink, in particular, relaxes the muscles and soothes violent or aggressive
tendencies.
Maybe try painting the conference room before the next annual board

<h2><b>SWING YOUR HANDS FOR HEADACHE RELIEF</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
When they get slammed with stress or a headache, many Chinese practice
something called "Li Shou", or "hand swinging".   You just swing your arms
back and forth, rhythmically for awhile (some Chinese do up to 1000
swings...but you don't need quite that many!).  The swinging helps you
achieve a relaxed state of mind, and the blood shifts from your head to your
hands, reducing the pressure.   Your hands will also 
become warm; gently stroke your face and head in circular patterns to further
ease pain.

<h2><b>A CALMING HERB</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
If you're restless or having trouble sleeping, a dose of the herb Valerian
may help.
It's been used for over 1000 years to soothe rattled nerves and insomnia, and
unlike commercial sleeping pills, won't leave you feeling groggy the next
morning.
<p>
Valerian can be taken in the form of a tea, tincture or added to bath water
for a relaxing soak.  No side effects, other than a slightly pungent smell,
have been reported.  The smell is supposedly attractive to rats, and legend
has it, valerian is what the Pied Piper used to lure the pests out of town.
   It certainly can chase away those nerves.

<html><head><title>DETERMINATION:  The Key to SUCCESS</title></HEAD><body bgcolor=#ffffff><img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>DETERMINATION:  The Key to SUCCESS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Most of us associate the word "determination" with images of Rocky Balboa
training for the fight of his life, or Thomas Edison sweating through
hundreds of failures before perfecting his inventions.  While the picture of
the unique, suffering genius is a dramatic, it's helpful to remember that
 determination is a fully human quality that each of us possesses.  We just
need to wake it up, and let it serve as the fire that fuels our dreams.  
<p>
Determination requires a road map.  Define a goal for yourself.  If you feel
overwhelmed at the prospect of figuring out your life's destiny all at once,
start small.  Allow your inner sense of determination to be honed on things
like training for a mini-marathon, improving a relationship, cooking a better
meatloaf.   Build on these successes as you allow your life's larger goals to
unfold in your heart and mind.  Create a realistic plan; decide what concrete
actions need to be taken.  Then, take those actions!
<p>
Action doesn't necessarily mean rashly quitting your job tomorrow and
settling in to write your novel.  Think of small , productive things you can
do, and do them consistently.    Remember that each action we take has a
consequence in the future.  The athelete's training of  today will influence
his performance at the Olympics next year.   A writer creates a novel one
page at a time.  When it comes to your own dreams, try and take at least 3
positive steps towards its realization each day.
<p>
Focus your energies.    Make a list of everything that seemingly stands
between you and your dreams. What  activities comprise your day?  Do they
support your goals, or do they serve as excuses to avoid them?  The sun,
reflected through a magnifying glass, can start a fire.  Clean out the
clutter in your mind and use your own inner power the same way. 
<p>
As we grow up, we hear an awful lot of "can'ts."  They're meant to protect us
in some cases, but they also cripple our ambitions.  When things get tough,
 be aware of  the voice in your head that says you "can't" and tell yourself
that you can and you will.
<p>
It's important not to confuse "determination" with "obsession."    Even the
most focused person experiences times when their plans just jump the track.
 Don't be discouraged.  Let that those events serve to enrich and teach you,
and always  remember that it is the journey, not the goal, that is ultimately
the most fulfilling.

Tilting your head down to read, work at the computer, or watch TV strains the neck and tires you out.    Bring the material up to your field of vision rather than drooping your head.  The same goes for talking on the telephone: if you crunch your neck down or to the side while using the phone, bring the handset up to meet your ear and mouth or switch to a headset.  You'll avoid future neck and upper back pain, and feel less fatigued during the day.

<title> FINDING MORE TIME
</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2><b> FINDING MORE TIME

</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<p>
Ever feel like you never have enough time?  Just playing "catch up" until you
can snatch a few moments for yourself?  Welcome to the club.   The result of
 all those time management courses is a sense of guilt if we don't get even
more done each day.  Do you need to be more organized?  Or do you just need a
different view of the time you have?
<p>
The concept of "time" is relatively new.  Not so long ago, people built their
lives around the natural rhythms of the day and the seasons.  There was no
clockwatchng, no sense of "next week."  Some cultures still don't know what a
birthday is.  This is considered "present moment thinking". Cultivating this
skill will allow you to get in sync with healthier pace of living (and
ironically, you'll probably find yourself accomplishing more with far less
stress!).

<p>
1) Take frequent breaks to reclaim your power over time. Rather than
continually reacting to outside forces that claim your time and drain your
energy, reconnect with the present moment.  Use a signal , such as a ringing
telephone, as a reminder to slow down and breathe.   If you start to feel
overwhelmed, take a bathroom break to do some deep breathing until you feel
the buzz of your inner engine slowing down.
<p>
2) Carve out a chunk of time each day--at least 15 minutes -- that is
strictly your own.   This time should be completely free of goals or
obligations; its just for you to "be."   Unstructured time is necessary to
clear a space where the soul can grow. Define these boundaries with friends
and family and make sure they respect it.
<p>
3) Create "snow days" once in awhile.  So much of our lives are planned, that
it leaves little room for the unexpected.  Make a date with yourself to take
a day or afternoon in which to be completely spontaneous.
<p>
4) Stop focusing on just the "big stuff" during the day and pay attention to
the ordinary moments.  In our hurry to get on to the next thing, we may miss
the small joys that comprise our life.
<p>
5) Make time for what it is you like to do.  Don't sacrifice hobbies or other
things you enjoy because you think "don't have the time right now."   Even if
you have to write it on your calendar, honor the need to do something for no
other reason than because it's fun.
<p>
6) On a similar note, don't sacrifice vacations.  For the same reason that
small amounts of unplanned time are critical to spiritual and emotional
health on a daily basis, a large block of time free of obilgation and
responsibility helps you reconnect with your sense of time on a friendlier
basis. 
<p>
In many ways, time is largely how you view it.  While there will always be
occasions when we have to "beat the clock",  most days should allow us to
slow down and take things in our own good time.

<title>USE ANGER TO BUILD YOUR SELF-ESTEEM</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2><b>USE ANGER TO BUILD YOUR SELF-ESTEEM
</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<P>
You're mad.  Really mad. You have an overwhelming urge to kick the dog (don't) or poison your boss (double-don't).  Instead, use your anger to create something positive.

<P>To your body, anger is a "fight or flight" response.  Adrenaline courses through your body, your heart races and your muscles prepare to run.  How do you handle such powerful feelings?  Most people tend to either explode or completely withdraw, feeling victimized and powerless.  Neither is very constructive. Next time you get angry, pay attention to the reason for it.  Are you mad because the only reason you didn't get the raise is the lack of a degree?  Do you feel steam coming out of your ears because your best friend is late again?

<P>Take a moment to cool down and identify the thing that has set you off...then take positive action: 

<P>1)	If you're mad at someone, let them know it.  Don't yell or lay blame; state the facts
 calmly ("I'm angry because you're late again and I don't think that's very considerate").  Then offer a plan for future incidents ("Let's agree to a 15 minute window next time. If either of us doesn't make it by then, we can leave with no hard feelings.")  You've just reclaimed your sense of power.

<P>2)	Keep an "anger journal", noting the incidents that set you off.  Think about strategies you can use to handle those situations when they arise again.

<P>3)	Pick an appropriate time for confrontation.  If there's too much going on when it happens, work off the tension of the incident or vent to a neutral friend  before dealing with the issue.  Don't sweep it under the rug -- just handle it when all parties are open to constructively talking.

<P>4)	Use anger as a motivator to achieve. Sometimes a good dose of "I'll show them" is just what you need to go back to school, finish that novel, end a lousy relationship.

<P>So don't get burned by anger -- use that energy to light a fire in your life instead.

<p align=center><h2><b>STRESS AND HEALING
</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    
<P>
Undergoing any kind of surgical procedure is stressful...but you may be your own worst enemy when it comes to the healing process.  Studies have shown that those people who react to stress take far longer to heal. This is because stress hampers the immune system and keeps it from working at its peak. Help the recovery process along by remembering a few things:

<P>1)	Relax.   Investigate techniques such as visualization, meditation or biofeedback to 		allow your body (and mind) to release fear and worry.

<P>2)	Take control.  Anxiety increases drastically when we feel we have no control over a 		situation.  While there isn't much you can do under the knife, think about what you can 		do to help your own recovery -- then do it.  Maybe it's listening to relaxation tapes in 	your hospital bed or doing mild exercises.

<P>3)	Get information...or don't.  Some people like to know as much as they can about their 	procedure and what to expect.  In that case, don't be shy about asking questions and 	requesting information.  Others prefer to just hope for the best.  If that's your style, be 	sure to tell well-meaning friends and family that you don't want to be bombarded with 	information.

<P>4)	Focus on the future.  Think about the outcome of the procedure and how it will help 		you.  Will you be able to breathe easier or move more freely?  Consider how your life 	will be improved because of it.  Think positively!

</b></h2>


<hr noshade>


    


<P>
				   

<P>Taking time out to chill out  is not only good for your health, it’s even better for your mood.  The longterm effects of relaxation breaks have been shown to increase your sense of creativity, inspiration, optimism, love and healing in everyday life.  Try out one of these quick pick me ups for half an hour every day and see if your overall mood doesn’t brighten:

<P>1)	Progressive muscle relaxation.  Tense each muscle group in your body-- face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, abdomen, back, buttocks, thighs, calves and feet -- then let it go limp for 30 seconds, becoming aware of any sensations of lightness or heaviness.  Repeat the procedure on those areas until you feel them release.

<P>2)	Stretching:  An instant energizer!  Reach for the ceiling, try and touch your toes, kneel on all fours and arch your back like a cat.  Listen to your body and stretch slowly, holding the position for a few seconds without bouncing.

<P>3)	Breathing.  Take a slow deep breath in through the nose.  Blow it out slowly through your mouth, exhaling enough to make a candle flame flicker, but not go out.  Repeat several more times.

<P>4)	Imagery.  Close your eyes and take a mini-vacation to a relaxing destination, like the beach or the mountains (no plane reservation required!).  Picture yourself there, but also, hear the sounds around you, inhale the scents.  Make it as detailed as possible and stay with the scene for about 15 minutes.

<P>5)	Meditation.  Learn to still that hamster-wheel in your brain by closing your eyes and focusing your attention on a single word or sound, such as "peace" or "one."  If your mind begins to drift, gently bring it back to the focus.
<P>

<title> KNOW YOUR STRESS STYLE </title>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>

You'd think "stress" symptoms would be easy to spot:  rapid breathing, shortness of temper, clenched jaws, tight muscles, an urge to kick the cat. But there are more subtle manifestations you should be aware of.  
<p>
These days, stress doesn't come and go just when that report is due or you're behind on bills. No sirree -- the kind of stress we 20th century-ites experience is persistent and corrosive. From the garbage trucks banging outside your window at 4 am, to the violence on the evening news, to rush hour traffic and a full workload at the office, our bodies are always reacting to these "mini crises." Unlike the "fight or flight" response in which a sudden stressful situation causes adrenaline to be dumped into our body before levelling out when the crisis ends--ongoing stress wears us down.  
<P>
In longterm stress situations, a more potent hormone called "cortisol" is provided in steady streams, to allow us to weather the tough times. In our ancestors' day, it may have been a drought. Today, it may be a hundred little things piled up day after day. The problem is, if our bodies never get a chance to turn off the cortisol faucet, the same hormone that's supposed to help us begins to erode our immune and cardiovascular systems.
<P>
To give your body a break, learn to recognize the persistent stressors that are always in the back of your mind: money worries? relationship problems? a high-pressure job? a house that's never as tidy as you'd like? Once you've identified them, pinpoint how they make you feel. Here are a few not-so-common symptoms of stress: fatigue, impatience, dry mouth, overspending, back pain, inability to concentrate, depression, exhaustion at the end of the day, apathy, skin rashes, oversleeping, anger, muscle soreness.  
<P>
Now that you know which stress symptoms are yours, here are some ways you can
combat them:
<BR><P>
<OL>
	<LI>Take time for yourself each day.  For 20 minutes (at least), do something you truly enjoy -- read, garden, take a walk. Remember, if you don't take your time, someone will take it for you.
	<LI>Practice deep breathing. Do this not only when dealing with a stressful situation, but several times a day just to re-establish energy and balance. While you're at it, visualize yourself as calm and stress-free.
	<LI>Eat whole foods that will build your body's defenses, and ease up on the caffeine.
	<LI>Get enough rest. It may seem you can't make time for a good night's sleep when you're under pressure, but this is the body's first line of defense. Make 7 to 9 hours a night a priority.
	<LI>Laugh every day.  Find an excuse to grab a chuckle and lighten up.
</OL>
<P>
On occasion, add some herbal help: 
<P>
Anxiety: kava kava, St. John's Wort, skullcap<BR>
Depression: St. John's Wort<BR>
Headaches: Feverfew, meadowsweet, skullcap<BR>
Mood Swings: kava kava, skullcap, linden flower<BR>
Heart Palpitations: Linden flower, motherwort<BR>
<BR>
<P>
Learn to conquer those sneaky stress signals...before they conquer you!

<p align=center>
<h2><b>CREATIVITY 101 
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
</p>
<p>
Creativity is an underused tool in our lives.  As adults, we're conditioned
to believe things "always" work a certain way, and lose a lot of the
unfettered imagination we had as kids.  Creative thinking, however, is
invaluable in problem solving and keeps life fresh and exciting.   A few
hints on recapturing the magic: 
<p>
1) Play "what if?" There's more than one "right" answer.   Learn to look at
situations or problems from many different angles.  
<p>
2) Break your routine.  Drive to work by a different route, read a different
newspaper, eat a scone with your morning coffee instead of your usual bagel.
Even little things can ease us out of a rut.
<p>
3) Brainstorm effectively.  There should be no judging of ideas.   Everything
goes.  Humor also helps open creative doorways.  Dress like Bozo for a
brainstorming session with your co-workers, or make everyone wear fake
nose-and-glasses.    
<p>
4) Play dumb.  Look at the subject like a" beginner", with no preconceived
notions.
<p>
5) Think in opposites. For example,  if you're looking for ways to SAVE
MONEY, dream up the wildest ideas you can for spending  it.  You may spot
a solution within the ridiculous.
<p>
6) Don't try so hard.  Often inspiration comes when you're doing something
completely unrelated, like working out or playing music.  Encourage
creativity to   hit when it will.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>DREAM WEAVERS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
All of us have plans for our lives, but in the day to day grind, few of us
ever act on them.  Thinking about our dreams is easy -- doing something
about making them come true is hard.  Here are a few suggestions on how to
take action towards those long-held goals.
<p>
1. Make a blueprint.  Set aside a few hours with just a pad of paper, a pen
and your thoughts.  Literally draw where it is you want to be, how to
"build" your dream, starting with the foundation and moving upwards.   
<p>
2. Reward yourself.  This is the old "positive reinforcement" trick, but it
works.  Say you've stuck to your exercise goals for the week; do
something nice for yourself, such as getting a massage or buying the shoes
you've been eyeing.
<p>
3. Draw a map.  Just as you need a clear picture of how you're going to
reach a destination when you travel, you need it for other destinations in
life, too.  Make a "starting point" to your goal, then create arrows
jutting out to the points you need to reach  as you go along.  You can do
this for daily goals, or long-term projects.
<p>
4. Mentally "live" the goal. Visualize yourself working towards it,
experiencing the various stops along the way.  Make it real.  Not only
will you energize yourself towards reaching the good stuff, you'll be
better able to cope with the potential pitfalls.

<p align=center>
<h2><b>WAKE UP CALLS</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
After a cataclysmic event -- an illness, a divorce, a death -most of us look
 at our life somewhat differently.  Frequently, such an event serves as a
reminder of how short life is and forces us to examine what it is we really
want to do with our time.
<p>
Some experts in the healing fields  feel that illness is one way the body
expresses the energy not being directed towards your true desires and needs.
 Noted healer Dr. Bernie Siegel likes to think of such events as a "reset
button" that allows us to start life afresh.   But how can you get in touch
with what is truly important to you and find the way to a more satisfying
life experience without waiting for a drastic event?  Here are five tips:
<p>
1) Keep a journal.  Recording your feelings every day is an excellent way of
   getting them out of your system, particularly those that can do harm over
time    (unexpressed rage, frustration, etc.)   One study showed that those
patients who   kept journals had more active immune systems than those who
didn't.
<p>
2) Do some exploring of your unexamined self. This can be done in a therapy
   group or a 12-step program.  The point is to find a forum and support
group that    forces you to look at  what you believe.
<p>
3) Four to six times a day, meditate, pray or listen to quiet music. Consider
these    times "healing intervals" that allow you to slow down and reconnect
with your    higher self. 
<p>
4) Live one hour at a time, and be aware of how you feel during that hour.
   Allow    your feelings to come forth, then take charge of them.  Resolve
to do something    about negative emotions within that time... or let them
go.  
<p>
5) Learn to love your physical body.  Spend 15 minutes a day naked in front
of a    mirror.  Examine the negative body messages you've been telling
yourself all    these years, then change them by addressing your body with
love.  Again, don't   waste precious time on negativity.  If you'd love to go
out dancing, but have    always felt "too fat"-- go dancing anyway!
<p>
Remember, your life is a series of moments that you are in charge of.  Make
the most of them.

<title> KICK-START YOUR DREAMS </title>
<head>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<center>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif"><h2> KICK-START YOUR DREAMS </h2>
</center>
<hr noshade>
<p>
What's on your personal wish list of life?  To write a best-seller?  Travel
through Europe on rollerblades?  Play the cello in a symphony orchestra?
 Dreams keep us going, make life more interesting.  Of course, making them
come true requires some action...but it may not be as overwhelming as you
think.  Here are ten tips to make your own dreams into reality:
<p>
1) Figure out your destination.  Every journey -- even a trip to the mall --
requires a sense of knowing where you're headed.  Otherwise, you'll drive
aimlessly.  Where is it you want to end up in life?  Once you decide that,
you can begin to "think backwards" for the connecting points you need to get
there.
<p>
2) See your dream as already happening.  Winning athletes and performers
successfully use visualization all the time.  Think of this exercise as
"self-fulfilling prophecy" -- if you clearly imagine already having or doing
what it is you really want, your brain goes on automatic pilot to reach that
goal.
<p>
3) Take action-- NOW!  We tend to imagine our dreams as "too big" to ever
really achieve.   But the greatest symphonies were written one note at a
time, the greatest novels written one word at a time. If you're thinking of
moving, start by picking up some real estate guides.  Want to lose weight?
Give up one food, just for today. Read one magazine on a subject you've
always wanted to learn.  Take small steps, and take them consistently.
<p>
4) Do your homework, so you can be ready when Opportunity knocks.  Determine
what it is you need to learn, whom you need to talk to, information you need
to gather,    Don't use "homework" as an excuse for putting off the real
goal, however --set a deadline for completing the info-gathering process. 
<p>
5) Find a mentor.  Learning from their experience (and mistakes) will save
you tons of time.
<p>
6) Create a strategy.  Exactly how do you plan to get from Point A to Point
Z?  Map out each step you must take.  
<p>
7) Take those steps.  Do you want to learn to play an instrument?  Commit one
hour a day or week to lessons or practice.  Keep your personal "appointments"
as religiously as you'd keep a doctor appointment.
<p>
8) Reward yourself.  Most of us save "rewards" for the really big
accomplishments of our life.  But the way to stay on track is to give
yourself a little "attaboy" for the many small steps along the way.  Don't
wait to drop 10 pounds before treating yourself-- celebrate the fact you
stayed away from ice cream for one whole day.
<p>
9) Expect some rough sailing.  Rejection and failure are just part of life.
 Treat them as part of your dream-building process, learn what you can from
the experience...and keep going!  Most people claim they regret what they
didn't do in life, versus any failure encountered along the way.
<p>
10) Be persistent.   And flexible. Becoming a ballerina may take longer than
making a perfect souffle.  But if you find that your dream isn't coming to
fruition, learn to be realistic.  Either downscale it (taking regular dance
classes) or find another one to pursue.  Maybe become an astronaut???

<p>
If you want to change your luck, all you may need to do is redecorate.
That's the philosophy behind Feng Shui ("fung shway"), the Chinese art of
placement.  It's based on the idea of harmony within natural and manmade
environments. The buildings we work in, which way a window faces, even where
we place a chair can positively or negatively affect the flow of life-energy
('Chi"). 
<p>
Look around a Chinese restaurant: notice any fish tanks?  Living things and
water draw positive energy (unless the tank is cloudy and the fish belly-up ;
then the restaurant may become a Donut Hut next month).  Windchimes keep
energy circulating.  Mirrors, considered the "aspirin" of feng shui, are used
to bring light to dark areas, soften sharp corners and reflect good energy
back into a room. 
<p>
If you want to increase your influence at work, place your desk so that you
face the door.  Having your back to it allows bad energy to "sneak up" on
you.  If you can't move the desk, hang a mirror so that you can see the door
behind you.
<p>
To maintain harmony and prosperity,  keep your kitchen neat and clean (easier
said than done for some of us).  The kitchen, particularly the stove, is
considered the "heart" of a home, according to the Chinese. It's best if you
have a clear sight of the kitchen entrance while standing there making
waffles -- if not, place a mirror behind the stove.   
<p>
Will all those mirrors make your home look like a Fun House?  No,  but you
will end up with a happier "feng" house!

<p>
According to feng shui masters, one easy way to improve the positive energy or "chi" within your home is to add thriving green plants. Choose plants that have broad leaves, like a pothos or Chinese money plant. Avoid plants with thorns or prickles, like cactus. Placing blossoming flowers around the
home is another attractive way to activate good "chi."

<title>A New Video from Alan Watts</title>

</head>



<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2>ZEN:The Best of Alan Watts</h2>

<hr noshade>

<p>

<IMG SRC="../../gifs/zen.gif" align=left><b><i>"The rippling waves lull the viewer into a state of blissful calm.  Like a wave itself, the film just flows on by, cleansing as it goes." </b></i>--- Booklist

<p>

Alan Watts is widely considered the West's foremost interpreter of 

Eastern thought. Filmmaker Elda Hartley produced seven films with her 

friend, from 1965 until his death in 1973.  She has combed her archives, 

creating a single program of Alan Watts' finest work. 

<p>

<i><b>ZEN: The Best of Alan Watts</b></i> distills a great teacher's insights 

on:

<ul>

<li><b>The Mood of Zen</b>: the basic teachings, flowing with life.

<li><b>Zen and Now</b>: thoughts on being here, now.

<li><b>Buddhism, Man and Nature</b>: Zen reflects the elegant images of 

nature: the universe in a single garden, the flow of water, the natural rhythms, 

our oneness with nature.

<li><b>Meditation</b>: how to stop the chatter and experience true calm.

</ul>

<p>

This remarkable film can help change your life, whether you know 

nothing about Zen, or have studied it for years.  Like Zen itself, 

there is always something new to discover with every visit with 

Alan Watts.

<p>

Produced by the Hartley Film Foundation.  Elda Hartley, now in her mid 

eighties, has been making films on health, spirituality and 

personal growth since 1965.  Her lifelong goal has been to promote 

an understanding of our interconnectedness that transcends race, religion, 

gender and national boundaries.

<title>One-on-One with Thomas Moore</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2><b>A Conversation with Thomas Moore</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/tmoore.gif" align=left><b><i>"I don't think we can pursue perfection and take care of the soul at the same time.  We would be better off honoring the imperfect family, living the imperfect marriage and enjoying loving and imperfect 
friends."</i></b>--- Thomas Moore, best-selling author of <i>Care of the Soul</i>
 and <i>Soul Mates</i>.
<p>
<br>
Self-acceptance, not self-improvment.  Care, not cure. These are 
the virtues Thomas Moore asks us to rbbber as we search for meaning 
in high-pressured, fast-paced lives.  His unique gift is to rbind 
us we can live soulfully at work, in marriage, as a parent, as a 
child --  in everything we do. He helps us focus on the deeper challenges 
and joys of the soul.
<p>
This Public Television special features Thomas Moore in a relaxed, 
wide-ranging conversation with writer Valerie Andrews.  Drawing insights 
from classical mythology, Renaissance philosophers and his experience as 
a therapist, Moore stresses that "care of the soul" is not about problb 
solving, but about giving ordinary life depth and value.
<p>
Moore urges us to find sacredness in everyday living:  in the reflection 
in a window, in a song, in the company of friends, even in the "meditation"
of washing dishes. He encourages us to "find something that takes you to a 
place that is so much beyond yourself that it is part of your spiritual 
life."
<p>
<i>A Conversation with Thomas Moore</i> can refresh your spirit, helping 
you care for your own soul. 60 mins.WSP 124 <b>$19.95</b>

<h4>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</h4>

<blockquote>
<h5>As an old man walked down the beach one day, he saw a child picking something up from the sand and throwing it into the sea.  The old man asked the child,<br>
"What are you doing?"<br>
"Chucking the starfish," the child replied.<br>
"Why?" asked the old man.<br>
"The starfish washed ashore in the high tide.  If they stay on the beach they will dry out and die, so I'm chucking them back into the ocean."<br>
The old man looked at the child and then at the beach and said, <br>

"There are hundreds of starfish on this beach.  How can what you're doing make any difference?"
<p>
The child bent down, picked up another starfish, pointed to it and said, "It makes a difference to this one," and threw it into the sea.</h5>

The Video Industry AIDS Action Committee <b>(VIAAC)</b> is a national network of volunteers, formed in August 1989, to raise money for HIV/AIDS care and education.  <b>VIAAC</b> was created in response to the exploding demand for AIDS services, in the face of inadequate funding from government sources.
<p>
Participation in <b>VIAAC</b> is open to home video, film, video distributors, game software manufacturers, retailers and employees in associated industries.
<p>
<b>VIAAC </b>raises money for qualifying organizations, both national and community-based, providing quality care to people with HIV/AIDS, which are under-funded by the public sector.  
<p>
Since its inception,<b> VIAAC</b> has distributed funds to over 65 beneficiaries.  Its standing beneficiaries include the Elizabeth Taylor's American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFar), Homestead Hospice & Shelter and AIDS Action Committee.
<p>
It's simply one person helping another.  Call VIAAC for information on how you can help -- 1-800-847-3669.

<b>I, CLAUDIUS</b><br>

<font size=-1>Masterpiece Theater's crowning epic!<br>

Meet the most powerful family of antiquity in this fascinating tale of treachery and 

debauchery.  Starring Sir Derek Jacobi, Sian Phillips, John Hurt and a host of 

distinguished actors, this special 

edition features scenes omitted from the 

original public television broadcast.  Also included is the famed 70-minute documentary, 

The Epic That Never Was, about the ill-fated 1937 film version of <i>I, Claudius</i>, which 

starred Charles Laughton and Merle Oberon.<br>

    Claudius, emperor of Rome, nears the end of his life and commences to write his 

family's history.  The incredible memoir begins before his birth and traces an epic of 

ruthless ambition, shocking debauchery and murderous intrigue set in one of history's 

most 

fascinating eras.  Claudius, the stammering and half-lame grandson of the scheming 

empress Livia, survives amidst corruption and deceit by playing the fool. 

    Finally, he assumes the crown, knowing full well that he will 

eventually be destroyed by those he trusts most. <br>

 Winner of four British Academy 

Awards,

<i>I, Claudius</i> is a true masterpiece!  13 hrs. on seven videocassettes.<br>

"Splendidly acted...An extraordinary achievement." - The New York Times<br></font>

Explore the political life and times of this provocative figure as he unrelentingly dissects how our much-acclaimed democratic freedoms often mask an irresponsible use of power.  His penetrating analysis of the media includes shocking examples of deception in our daily news, and he encourages us to extricate ourselves from this "web of deceit" through a course of "intellectual self-defense."  Joining the controversial discussion are major journalists and critics including Bill Moyers, William F. Buckley, Jr., Tom Wolfe and Peter Jennings. Whether you agree with Chomsky or not, he tirelessly addresses some of the most important issues of our time and raises questions that are essential for anyone living in our complex era.</FONT><BR>"An invigorating introduction to one of the least soporific of American minds."Vincent Canby, The New York Times<BR>2 hrs. 46 mins. on two videocassettes.

Moyers gathers an engaging group ranging from Biblical scholars and translators to composers and psychotherapists for a lively debate on what the Genesis stories mean to contemporary society.  How do current issues like racism, dysfunctional families and environmental responsibility enter into the same forum with issues of faith and the struggle between good and evil?

See how some brilliant kids in need of a shower nearly brought down IBM after the company decided to "buy, not build" their own PC technology.  Watch as Bill Gates, now the richest man in the world, launches Microsoft with Jay Leno and the Rolling Stones, and look ahead to the future of the Information Superhighway.

These lush BBC productions feature two heroines who illustrate Austen's extraordinary grasp of human experience. The beautiful and clever Emma blissfully ignores life's problems, preferring to spend time engineering suitable matches for her friends. Well-meaning but insensitive, she frequently confuses self-gratification for good intentions.  Arguably Austen's wittiest novel, it was the basis for the recent hit movie, Clueless.<P>Persuasion is a portrait of Austen's most mature heroine.  Convinced by her snobbish family that her suitor is unworthy, Anne Elliot has turned down Captain Wentworth's proposal and become a spinster.  After eight years, however, he returns an affluent sea captain, while her family is forced into genteel poverty.  Even as she recognizes her youthful foolishness, Anne struggles to accept that her lover's heart now seems set upon someone else.</FONT><BR>4 hrs. 15 mins. on two videocassettes.

With only one suitable dress to her name, Lillie was determined to conquer high society.  Befriended by notables like Oscar Wilde and James Whistler, she also had a scandalous affair with the future King of England and then his nephew, which resulted in an illegitimate child. Bored with her status as a "professional beauty," Langtry entered the theater, ultimately becoming one of the most famous actresses of her time.  Suddenly, the wealthy benefactors began to disappear,  the press attacked her and she lost her fortune.  Her daughter, discovering the truth of her lineage, disowned her.   With her career at an end, the famed beauty lived out her last years in the south of France, surrounded by memories of her extraordinary life.

Take an extremely rare glimpse at the unorthodox yet powerfully effective methods used by Tibetan Buddhists in healing the body, soul and planet. The Gyuto monks create potent spiritual phenomena and physical changes through their ritual chanting.  Because of the massive world shifts occurring around them, they are allowing certain chants to be heard for the first time.  His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, authorized the filming of the Tantra of Gyuto and provides the introduction to these mysterious ceremonies.

<b>HOW TO THRIVE IN MATRIMONY!</b><br>

<font size=-1>The Marriage Survival Kit<br>

What does it take to stay happily married?  Hosted by clinical psychologist Dr. Wendy

LeDoux, this series provides answers by examining three of the most important issues

married couples face.<br>

	Keeping the Passion explores how to maintain

a vibrant, romantic, and rewarding sexual relationship.  Money and Marriage tackles the

financial management problems that plague at least 25% of all couples.  And Staying

Faithful shows you how to build trust and avoid "being available" for affairs - as well as

dealing with the aftermath of infidelity.  Required viewing for all newlyweds - and

those couples who still want to act like them! <BR> </FONT> 2 hrs. 30 mins. on three videocassettes.

<IMG SRC="../gifs/rountrip.gif" align=left><b>Round Trip</b>

<br>

<font size=-1>

A strong, white light.  Total peace.  Complete love.<br>

Catherine's body gave out after eight years of debilitating illness.  John ran out of oxygen while scuba diving.  Mary had serious complications during childbirth.  Alena's tour bus flipped over, tossing her on the pavement.  Alan's heart fluttered, then stopped, during surgery. <br>





In each case, these men and women left their bodies.  They watched themselves "die."  They were drawn into a great white light, where they felt unconditional love and deep joy.   They all  "came back"  -- reluctantly. <br>





Though their life experiences are quite different, their Near Death Experiences are remarkably similar.  In Round Trip, you'll share powerful, first-hand recollections from five people whose lives have been profoundly changed.  You'll also hear from a philosopher, a parapsychologist and a theologian, who will help you interpret these extraordinary events. <br>





Round Trip sheds light on several timeless questions:

<ul>





<li> What happens when we die?

<li> Does our spirit live on?

<li>Do we meet our deceased friends and relatives?

<li>Is it frightening - or wonderful?

</ul>





Join us on this unforgettable journey. <br>

The concert film that came first and still the best!
<BR>
<B>JAZZ ON A SUMMER'S DAY</B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Before Woodstock, Monterey Pop, The Last Waltz and Gimme Shelter, there was the first and best of all concert films, shot by master photographer Bert Stern at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.
You'll see electrifying performances by legends at the peak of their craft:  Theolonius Monk performing the haunting "Blue Monk", Anita O'Day's scintillating scat "Sweet Georgia Brown" and Chuck Berry's rocking "Sweet Little Sixteen."  Other performers include Louis Armstrong, Dinah Washington and Mahalia Jackson.  Jazz On A Summer's Day is a dazzling display of color photography and rich human observation.  When the film eavesdrops on a pair of lovers jiving at dawn on a rooftop and flies over the ocean to look down on the rich in their yachts, it captures the spirit of another era.

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Did jazz just happen?  How does a piece of music tell a story?  And how can you learn to love practicing? Acclaimed musician Wynton Marsalis hosts this inspired music series for young people.
<P>
Joined by his jazz band, conductor Seiji Ozawa and students from Tanglewood, Marsalis makes learning about music fun. Rousing performances show how Sousa's European-style orchestra ultimately evolved into the New Orleans jazz of Scott Joplin and Satchmo.  Seamlessly moving between composers as diverse as Prokofiev and Gershwin, Marsalis shows how to recognize the musical "clues" that make a piece of music unfold, and compares Ellington's jazz version of "The Nutcracker" to Tchaikovsky's to illustrate the diversity of rhythm.  Joined by famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the two masters share their secrets for  tackling the hated monster of practice.   Marsalis puts the "fun" back into "fundamentals"!

A remarkable woman by any standards, Hildegard of Bingen was even more so during a time when women's choices were extremely limited.   <br>    Given to the church as a child, Hildegard experienced the cloister as a sanctuary where her unique talents could flourish.  She eventually took over the powerful role of Benedictine Abbess, corresponding (and clashing) frequently with the Pope.  An expert herbalist, she wrote medical texts on holistic healing and women's medicine.  Hildegard also developed her musical gift, composing brilliant liturgical chants which still astonish scholars today.  Her inspiring theories about the lifeforce within each of us and the power of the Divine are portholes to the spirit that will guide you in your own journey of personal transformation. </font><br>60 mins.

In conversations that recall his famous interviews with Joseph Campbell, journalist Bill Moyers talks with Smith about the differences and surprising similarities of the world's great religions. <br>Because he has personally participated in all of them, Smith clearly explains beliefs that often puzzle us.  He's discovered the mysteries of multi-phonic chanting with Tibetan Lamas and endured the exhausting practice of silently meditating eight hours a day with a Zen Master.  He has struggled to understand the "intertwining of opposites," which links Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism.  Smith illustrates how the act of prayer serves as "living conversation" between Jews, Christians and their Gods and examines the spiritual vacuum most humans live in today.  Misconceptions about the Muslim world are clarified, and the inspiring principles that guide Islam are held out as a potential bridge to all people. <br>These thought-provoking discussions prove that all religions are windows onto the same transcendent truths.  6 hrs. on five videocassettes. <font size=-1><br>E8822  THE WISDOM OF FAITH   $119.95<br><a href="spirit2.html"><img src="images/more.gif" border=0></a><br><center><a href="http://www.wellmedia.com/formlong.html"><img src="images/orders.gif" border=0></a><a href="feature1.html"><img src="images/xfeat.gif" border=0></a><a href="document1.html"><img src="images/xdoc.gif" border=0></a><a href="misc1.html"><img src="images/xmisc.gif" border=0></a><a href="all1.html"><img src="images/alph.gif" border=0></a></center></body></html>

WHY AM I HERE?</b> <br><font size=-1>The goal is one.  The paths are many. - Hindu proverb<br>From a beggar in Calcutta to a high-powered executive, the same questions arise at some point in both their lives:  <i>Who am I?  Why am I here?</i>  Best-selling author Thomas Moore (<i>Care of the Soul</i>) shows how the great religious traditions of the world strive to answer these mysteries. <br>Incorporating the films of Elda Hartley, noted for her penetrating documentaries of the world's faiths, ordinary Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, Muslims and Sufis discuss their personal quest.  Travel inside a Christian monastery, where the monk reconnects with God through a life of undisturbed silence.  Talk with a former Catholic who has a new identity as a practicing Buddhist monk.  What is the reason behind the Sufi "whirling dervish"?  How have Tibetan Buddhists mystified experts with their unusual chanting methods?  Journey along the many fascinating pathways man uses in his ultimate journey towards a single goal: enlightenment. </font><br>Approx. 60 mins.

The main goal of Zen Buddhism,  satori infuses all of Japanese daily life, from their reverence for nature to their attitude towards business.  You'll visit the Karinsha School of Business Management, which bases it's principles on Zen teachings.  Be part of a bustling Buddhist street festival, and attend a Shinto ceremony inside a factory.

VIAAC CELEBRATES 5-YEAR ANNIVERSARY WITH EXPANDED FUNDRAISIERS AND NATIONWIDE
REACH<br><br>

15 New Beneficiaries Added in 1995<br><br>

As the Video Industry AIDS Action Committee marked its fifth anniversary in
 1995, more than 85 AIDS health-care facilities received grants from the
group's fundraising activities.  From our first beneficiary, Homestead
Hospice in Los Angeles, VIAAC now reaches AIDS agencies in more than 30
states and Canada.  "We are extremely excited about our growth over the past
five years," says newly-elected VIAAC president Jere Rae-Mansfield. "It's a
milestone accomplishment that validates the hard work of an all-volunteer
organization, and each year we are able to give to more AIDS agencies which
still need financial help."  
<br><br>
Since incorporating in 1990, VIAAC's fundraising activities have grown
significantly, adding an art auction and car raffle last year to popular
 annual events such as the silent auction of celebrity memorabilia at the
Video Software Dealers Association's annual convention.   As an example of
VIACC's growth, in 1990 the group disbursed $88,000 to nine AIDS health-care
facilities in seven states.  Now the list totals more than 85  agencies in 32
states.  More than $50,000 has been distributed in Canada through VIAAC
Canada, a separately run satellite organization.  
<br><br>
New fundraisers have contributed greatly to VIAAC's expanded reach,
including, "A Penny For AIDS" (PFA), a national program spearheaded by former
 VIAAC president Len Levy and board member Larry Klingman in 1993.  The
ambitious fundraiser was VIAAC's first effort to include the retail community
by asking video retailers to donate a penny for every sale and  rental
transaction during National AIDS Awareness week, Nov. 24 - Dec. 1.  In its
first year, the PFA campaign yielded more than $88,000 through retail  and
studio contributions. In 1994, headed by Jere and her husband and
steering-committee member, Scott Mansfield, the campaign raised $120,000,
with more than $20,000 in retailer contributions.  In 1995, the campaign
 yielded an additional $100,000.  
<br><br>
Jere organized VIAAC's first Art Auction in 1994, co-sponsored by Beverly
Hills gallery owner Michael Schwartz.  The event put an additional $20,000 in
VIAAC coffers that year and in 1995 contributed another $16,000.  Plans are
already underway for this year's art auction, scheduled for September.  
<br><br>
In addition, in 1994, VIAAC created much excitement with a raffle which
awarded a BMW automobile. The car was generously donated by PDS Fulfillment
 president Bernie Gainey and ticket sales raised more than $48,000.  Our New
York chapter has nearly tripled in size, and through local VSDA events and
the East Coast Video Show, the group has greatly contributed to  VIAAC's
overall fundraising efforts.  
<br><br>
VIAAC Canada was formed as an independent non-profit group north of the
border in January 1994.  The group holds several  fundraising events each
year, including several at the Focus On Video  convention held annually in
Toronto. To date, VIAAC Canada has distributed  more than $50,000 to AIDS
health care facilities.  
<br><br>
VIAAC could not have accomplished this milestone anniversary without the
commitment of its members, past and present.  "Anyone who has ever sold a
raffle ticket or collected a penny at a rental counter for VIAAC shares in
this tremendous milestone," says Mansfield.  "We can only hope VIAAC won't be
around to celebrate a 10th anniversary."  
<br><br>
VIAAC CANADA OFF TO A TRIUMPHANT START
<br><br>
In the past two years, VIAAC Canada has established itself as an important
 part of the Canadian home entertainment industry and a vital source of
 funding for various AIDS-related organizations in Canada. Shelly Davine,
 president of VIAAC Canada, would like to thank and compliment everyone on
the  steering committee for their continuous hard work and commitment.  "It
took us a while to get going, but now we're off and running." In the past
 year, VIAAC Canada donated over $35,000 to Canadian-based AIDS charities and
 was a "Gold Sponsor" of this year's Canadian Foundations for AIDS Research
 (CANFAR) Gala.  
<br><br>
In May 1995, VIAAC Canada raised approximately $3,000 in conjunction with
 "Fashion Cares," a fundraising event sponsored by the AIDS Committee of
 Toronto (ACT). At the event, VIAAC Canada set up a video store boutique and
 sold videocassettes and movie memorabilia. All products at the boutique were
 donated by Canadian-based home video suppliers and distributors.  In
September, VIAAC Canada launched its second annual "A Penny For AIDS"
 campaign and held various fundraising events in conjunction with the Focus
On  Video trade show. VIAAC staffed a booth on the show floor, sold
entertainment  coupon books, soft drinks, and tickets to a World Wrestling
Federation event  and cocktail party. Coliseum Video donated the tickets, and
soft drinks were  donated by PepsiCo Canada. 
<br><br>
In addition, the "VIAAC Band," comprised of video industry representatives,
 performed at the convention's Retail Appreciation Night. At the party, VIAAC
 Canada held a silent auction and total proceeds from the convention totaled
 more than $4,500.  
<br><br>
This fall, VIAAC Canada co-sponsored a screening of the Orion Home Video film
 Jeffrey in conjunction with ACT. In addition, Alliance Releasing generously
 donated 50 cents from each sale of the video Kids in Canada. The group also
 received a generous donation from CFP Distribution, which donated money in
 lieu of corporate Christmas gifts.  
<br><br>
This year, VIAAC Canada has a number of fundraisers lined up, including
 another event with Fashion Cares, the Focus On Video trade show, a
Masquerade  Ball tentatively scheduled for October, and a "New Year's II"
dance scheduled  for February 1997.  
<br><br>
For more information about how to become involved in VIAAC Canada, please
 contact Shelly Davine at 416-928-3175.  
<br><br>
EAST COAST
<br><br>
The East Coast VIAAC committee participated in this year's annual East Coast
 Video Show held at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J. Our booth was
 organized and staffed by Tom and Linda Friedman, and a total of more than
 $1,000 was raised at the event.  
<br><br>
The committee is currently organizing a "Spring Fling" event in conjunction
 with music industry AIDS fundraising group LifeBeat. The plan is to stage a
 summer preview benefit by Memorial Day at a top Manhattan movie theater.  
<br><br>
UPDATES:
<br><br>
VIAAC is pleased to announce that it hit the $100,000 mark in donations in
1995 for the third year in a row.
<br><br>
Last year's highlights included new consumer participation when Borders Books
& Music allowed VIAAC to set up "A Penny For AIDS" barrels for penny
donations from their customers. Many consumers, who heard about PFA through
expanding publicity efforts by Sue Procko Public Relations, made
contributions directly to many of our beneficiaries, including a New York
City beneficiary which received 175,000 pennies. DIMAC Direct, a Farmingdale,
 N.Y.-based direct-mail company, contributed 370,000 pennies to a local AIDS
health-care facility.  Next year, PFA kits containing information about the
campaign, will be sent to all of our beneficiaries.  Press releases about PFA
will also direct consumers to take their personal "piggy banks" to local
agencies if their local retail store is not participating in the campaign.
 Of course, we all hope that there will not be a need for the "A Penny For
AIDS" fundraiser next year, but VIAAC will be there and we expect retailers
and other video companies will continue to pledge their support.  
<br><br>

<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2><b>Quantum Healing: Toward Perfect Health</b></h2><p>
<hr noshade>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/quantum.gif" align=left><b>Featuring Dr. Deepak Chopra</b>
<b><blockquote><i>"The force responsible for healing is within the patient."
</b></i>---- Dr. Deepak Chopra</blockquote>
<font size=+1>You already have the tools you need to be completely healthy.</font>
<p>
Best selling author Dr. Deepak Chopra is uniquely qualified to merge the 
best of Eastern and Western wisdom.  He has studied medicine in his native 
India and earned his M.D. in the United States.  As Chief of Staff at New 
England Memorial Hospital, he witnessed spontaneous cures of seemingly 
terminal illnesses.  Western science does not explain these "mysterious" 
cures, but ancient Ayurvedic wisdom sheds light on our mind's profound 
role in our total health.
<p>
<i>Quantum Healing: Toward Perfect Health</i> examines the partnership 
of the body, mind and spirit in obtaining and maintaining complete 
well-being.  Dr. Chopra explains his compelling, innovative concepts in 
clear, simple terms -- making them easy to apply in everyday life.
<p>
<i>Quantum Healing: Toward Perfect Health</i> also features interviews 
with other pioneers in the field, including Bernie Siegel on healing, 
Elmer Green on biofeedback on Dolores Kreiger on therapeutic touch.
<p>
Produced by the Hartley Film Foundation, in conjunction with The 
Institute of Noetic Sciences. Elda Hartley, now in her mid eighties, has 
been making films on health, spirituality and personal growth since 1965.  
Her lifelong goal has been to promote an understanding of our 
interconnectedness that transcends race, religion, gender and national 
boundaries.

<hr noshade>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/dietfor.gif" align=left><b><i>"Our current diet is a recipe for disaster.  We can do much better."</i></b>
<p>
<b>Host John Robbins, a Pulitzer Prize nominee, turned away from the 
family-owned Baskin-Robbins ice cream business to regain his own health. 
His extensive research on nutrition and food production led him to 
dramatic conclusions on how we can heal our planet  -- and ourselves.</b>
<p>
Most of us consider our diet a strictly personal choice.  We understand 

our eating habits affect our appearance, our lifestyle, our health.  
But do you know how deeply your food choices affect our air, our water, 
our land?
<p>
In simple and startling pictures, John Robbins takes us on a journey 
through the great American food machine.  His controversial findings and 
theories will astonish you.  According to Robbins, a diet based on animal 
products is not only unhealthy for our bodies -- it causes deep and 
lasting damage to the environment.
<p>
While <i>Diet for a New America</i> graphically outlines these problems -- 
it also offers solutions.  Robbins has a vision of hope.  We can make a 
real difference by returning to a caring and conscientious lifestyle.  
Even small dietary changes can have a profound healing influence.
<p>
This remarkable program, first shown on Public Television,
can be your first step toward healthier living.

<b>No jokes. No spandex.  No silly, worthless exercises.  At last, a

<p>

<blockquote><i><b>

	"I wanted to create a practical, results-oriented program

	----  Host Ed Perazone</blockquote> 

Using simple equipment 40 minutes a day, 3 days a week,

you can achieve startling results in minimal time.

Includes aerobic warm-up, stretching, resistance exercises and

cool-down and is especially designed for "fifty-plussers" who

want to remain strong, alert and energetic.

Host Ed Perazone, 64, knows this program works because he designed it 

for himself.  Incapacitated after a serious accident, he created his <b>SSWELL</b> 

("Seniors,Strength and Wellness") program to rebuild his 

body, mind and spirit.

<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/greenwin.gif" align=left><b>
"I believe you can be 'saved' simply by listening to the still, small voice within you."  
				Filmmaker Elda Hartley </b>

<p>
 
 Longtime filmmaker Elda Hartley set out to make a film about aging.  A senior citizen herself,  
she quickly realized she'd make a good subject for her own film.  Green Winter is a highly  
personal, deeply felt reflection on growing old that will appeal to anyone facing a similar  
journey.  
<p>
Elda draws on her decades of experience traveling the world, documenting the great cultural,  
religious and spiritual traditions. Green Winter explores the wisdom of many cultures, offering  
a refreshing range of viewpoints on aging.  For example, you'll meet a 95 year old weaver in a  
community where people routinely live over 100 years.  You'll also see a Hindu cremation  
ceremony on the banks of the Ganges, experiencing an Eastern view of life and death.  
<p>
Closer to home, Elda examines a wide range of everyday issues: retirement vs. continuing  
work, dealing with a spouse in declining health, considering nursing homes and attitudes  
toward death and dying.  
<p>
Green Winter has won several awards, including the Cine Gold Eagle for independent  
filmmakers.  
<p>
Elda, now in her mid seventies, has been making films on health, spirituality and personal  
growth since 1965.  She created the Hartley Film Foundation to further her lifelong goal of  
promoting an understanding of our interconnectedness that transcends race, religion, gender  
and national boundaries..

<title>The Problem With Food</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2><b>The Problem With Food </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/probfood.gif" align=left><b>Honest, sensitive advice on successfully coping with eating disorders.  As seen on Public  
Television.</b> 
  <p>
Eating disorders are more prevalent than ever.  Learn how to identify the warning signs, deal with the causes, and successfully cope with anorexia, bulimia or compulsive overeating.  
<p>
Most eating disorders occur between the ages of 13-25.  They can impede a young person's ability to finish school, find a job or manage the challenges of becoming a mature adult.  The statistics are alarming:  
<ul>
<li>Anorexia nervosa strikes approximately 1 in every 200-250 young women in  
that age group.  
<li>Up to 5% of college women in the United States are bulimic.  
<li>Up to 40% of people who are obese may be binge eaters.  
<li>The incidence of eating disorders is increasing in all socio-economic classes.  
 </ul>
<p>
The Problem with Food examines how real people deal with eating disorders.  You'll meet  
counselors, parents and -- most important -- teenagers and young adults who are dealing with eating disorders every day.  You'll learn from their first-hand experience and see how they are overcoming their problem with food.  
<p>
Remember, there is no single ideal weight that is right for everyone.  However, if you are  
concerned that you or someone you love is indeed suffering from an eating disorder, this  
program can help.  
<p> 
This program was produced as a community service by WQED/Public Television.

<p>
<h4> Introducing <I>Jancis Robinson's Wine Course</I>.  Everything you need to know to enjoy wine.</h4><p>

"<I>Jancis Robinson's Wine Course</I> is thoroughly good television.  Each program tells a fascinating story and the photography is beautiful.  The greatest achievement, however, is to personalize wine-making."  			The <I>Times</i> of London
<p>
"Jancis Robinson is witty, brilliant, authoritative...of all the wine writers in the world today, she may well be the most gifted." 			The <I>Wine Advocate</I>
<p>

This remarkable BBC series will de-mystify the subject for everyone who enjoys wine, but can be intimidated by large wine lists, snooty waiters or "wine snobs."  <I>Jancis Robinson's Wine Course</I> is a beautifully filmed, grape-by-grape introduction to the world of wine.  It's already a critical and popular success in Britain. <p>

You'll see the places and meet the people create the world's great wines.  This five-tape set will teach you all about wine, but Jancis never lets you take it too seriously.  Editor of <I>The Oxford Companion to Wine</I>, Jancis enjoys an international reputation as a writer and expert. She is one of only 194 "Masters of Wine" and the sole British journalist to pass the notoriously difficult exam.  Jancis now writes a regular column for the <I>Wine Spectator</I>  and <I>The Financial Times</I>. <p>

<ul>
<li><b>Tape 1</b>:  Introduction and Chardonnay.  Learn how wine is made and how to taste it.  See why Chardonnay is taking over the world. <p>

<li><b>Tape 2</b>: Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc.  How to store wine - and whether you should.  Meet traditional Bordeaux wine merchants, the new breed in Chile and New Zealand, and the "flying winemakers." <p>

<li><b>Tape 3</b>:  Syrah/Shiraz and Riesling.  Visit Marcel Guigal, who has created wines people will kill for. Then travel to Germany, where the trade can use a really good scandal like the one that saved Austrian wine.  Learn about corks, sweet wines and "noble rot." <p>

<li><b>Tape 4</b>:  Pinot Noir and Merlot. Does wine expresses a particular spot on the globe, or the skills of the people who made it?  What is the louse that's eating Napa Valley? <p>

<li> <b>Tape 5</b>:  Fizz and Grape Invaders. Why does the mixture of gas and wine spell c-e-l-e-b-r-a-t-i-o-n?   See how bubbles get into champagne and how to open the bottle the safe way. Then consider indigenous versus international grape varieties. <p>

<hr noshade>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/parent.gif" align=left><b><i>"Kids need parents, not tall pals."</b></i>
   --- Psychologist Dr. Lee Hausner, who hosts this program, is 
a recognized authority on effective parenting.  She is author of 
"Children of Paradise" and co-author of "Homework without Tears."
<p>
Raising responsible, emotionally secure children in today's world 
is perhaps the biggest challenge parents face. How can you prepare 
for the changes you -- and your child -- will encounter in this 
potentially turbulent period?  How do you stay confident in your 
parent/child relationship?  How do you handle discipline, parenting's 
most difficult job?
<p>
Dr. Hausner, a psychologist with over 30 years experience, offers a 
clear and practical approach to effective parenting.  In this program, 
you'll learn:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Various discipline styles parents use.
 <li>How to communicate more effectively.
 <li>How to set limits and establish consequences.
 <li>How to create your own "Discipline Action Plan."
</ul>
These simple, effective techniques will help you find that delicate 
balance between permissiveness and control.  You'll also hear real-life 
questions from parents, with Dr. Hausner's own personal insights and 
anecdotes.

<p>
Parenting for Today: Who's in Charge? can help you -- as you help your 
children grow into independent, well-adjusted young adults.

<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2><b>Round Trip</b></h2>

<hr noshade>

<p>

<IMG SRC="../../gifs/rountrip.gif" align=left><h3>A strong, white light.  Total peace.  Complete love.</h3>


Catherine's body gave out after eight years of debilitating illness.  John ran out of oxygen while scuba diving.  Mary had serious complications during childbirth.  Alena's tour bus flipped over, tossing her on the pavement.  Alan's heart fluttered, then stopped, during surgery. <p>


In each case, these men and women left their bodies.  They watched themselves "die."  They were drawn into a great white light, where they felt unconditional love and deep joy.   They all  "came back"  -- reluctantly. <p>


Though their life experiences are quite different, their Near Death Experiences are remarkably similar.  In Round Trip, you'll share powerful, first-hand recollections from five people whose lives have been profoundly changed.  You'll also hear from a philosopher, a parapsychologist and a theologian, who will help you interpret these extraordinary events. <p>


Round Trip sheds light on several timeless questions: <p>
<ul>


<li> What happens when we die?
<li> Does our spirit live on?
<li>Do we meet our deceased friends and relatives?
<li>Is it frightening - or wonderful?
</ul>


Join us on this unforgettable journey. <p>

<title>Speaking With Your Angels</title>

</head>



<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2><b>Speaking with Your Angels: A Guide<br>
A One-hour Public Television Special</b></h2>

<hr noshade>

<p>

<IMG SRC="../../gifs/angels.gif" align=left>According to Time magazine, almost 70 % of 
the U.S. population believes in angels.  All 
four major religions recognize angels as messengers from God whose purpose is to guide 
and teach human beings.  

<p>

Speaking with Your Angels: A Guide is a one-hour Public Television special that teaches 
you how to communicate directly with angels through writing.  The program features a 
workshop conducted by Trudy Griswold and Barbara Marx, sisters and co-authors of 
Angelspeake: How to Talk with your Angels, recently published by Simon & Schuster.  
Griswold and Marx, who have been leading these workshops nationally for five years, 
teach that you can receive angelic guidance by following a simple seven-step method: 
pray, breathe, listen, write, accept, inner knowing and trust.

<p>

Speaking with Your Angels: A Guide is a 

practical and inspirational program.  It teaches 
that reaching your angels is as simple as reading a recipe from a cookbook.  The results 
speak for themselves.  You'll see and hear workshop participants discover their angelic 
messages of guidance and love.  

<p>

As co-author Trudy Griswold explained it, "Writing to your angels provides an 
opportunity for people to take an active role in communicating with their angels -- to ask 
for guidance, support or comfort.  And, written communication leaves the person with a 
permanent record of that teaching which can be read and reread.

<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2><b>Who Am I?  Why Am I Here?<br>
featuring Thomas Moore</b></h2>

<hr noshade>

<p>

<IMG SRC="../../gifs/wai.gif" align=left><b><i>"The goal is one.  The paths are many."</i></b>--- Hindu proverb.


<p>

<br>

From a beggar in Calcutta to a high-powered executive in a New York high-rise, the same 
two questions arise at some point in both their lives:  "Who am I?"  "Why am I here?"  

<p>

In this enlightening public television special, best-selling author Thomas Moore 
(Care of the Soul and Soul Mates) shows how the great religious traditions of the 
world strive to answer these mysteries.    

<p>
 
Incorporating the films of Elda Hartley, noted for her penetrating documentaries of 
the world's faiths, ordinary Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, Muslims and 
Sufis discuss their personal quest.

<p>

Travel inside a Christian monastery, where the monk leaves the distractions of the world 
behind  to reconnect with God through undisturbed silence.  Talk with a former Catholic 
who sees no separation between his new identity as a practicing Buddhist monk and his "day job" in the business world.   Jews discuss the sense of a God involved in everything they do, the Agnostic struggles to define an interior life unsupported by any particular
belief, and the Taoist advises, "lighten up!"    What is the reason behind the Sufi 
"whirling dervish"?   How have Tibetan Buddhists mystified experts with their unusual 
chanting methods?  Journey along the many fascinating pathways man uses in his ultimate 
journey towards a single goal:  enlightenment.

<i>Who Am I? Why Am I Here?</i> featuring Thomas Moore runs for

<title>Radiant Life of Hildegard Bingen</title>

</head>



<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2><b>The ancient music, art and poetry of <br>
Hildegard of Bingen  can help you on 
your own quest <br> for a joyful spiritual life in today's world.</b></h2>

<hr noshade>

<p>

<IMG SRC="../../gifs/radlif.gif" align=left>She was a 12th century Rhineland mystic, composer, author, activist and healer -- a 
remarkable woman by the standards of any time.

<p>

In an era when women chose between marriage or the convent, the church represented a 
sanctuary for them to develop their individual gifts.  "Given" to the church as a child, 
Hildegard used the cloister to develop her own creativity.  She eventually became a 
powerful Benedictine Abbess, working (and clashing) frequently with Popes and other 
religious leaders.  An expert herbalist, she wrote medical texts on holistic healing and 
women's medicine.  Convinced of a powerful body/mind/spirit connection, she 
considered the garden, the pharmacy and the chapel essentially a single room.

<p>

At 42, Hildegard began having lucid visionary experiences about our sacred relationship 
to God and the natural world.  She recorded what she experienced in words and images,  
vividly describing a theology that embraced the whole of the natural world, what she 
termed "The Web of Creation." 

<p>

In a stunning example of her versatility, Hildegard also composed brilliant liturgical 
chants for women singers. These compositions still astonish scholars today and are 
performed in this program using authentic 12th century instruments.

<p>

The Rev. Dr. Lauren Artress, Canon of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, provides a 
fascinating historical introduction to this extraordinary woman.    The heart of the 
program is a meditative collection of Hildegard's music, poetic text and luminous 
visions.  

<p>

Join us, and let the work of Hildegard of Bingen open a porthole to the spirit and guide 
you in your own journey of transformation.

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2>The Gospel According to Jesus</h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>

<IMG SRC="../../gifs/gaj.gif" align=left><b><i>"What <u>is</u> the gospel according to Jesus?  Simply this: that the love we all long for in our innermost heart is already present, beyond longing." </b></i>--- Stephen Mitchell, author of  <i>The Gospel According to Jesus</i>.
<p>
<h4> Introducting <I>The Gospel According To Jesus</I>, a new translation and guide to his essential teachings as told throughout America.</h4><p>
<p>
There is no person in the history of the world who has been so famous and so widely interpreted as Jesus of Nazareth.  For two thousand years, beginning with the Gospels, people have tried to capture the essence of his teachings in words, in art, in music -- and in their daily experience.<p>

<I>The Gospel According to Jesus continues</I> this noble quest by focusing on Jesus' own words.  This new, two-hour program is based on poet/scholar Stephen Mitchell's popular Harper-Collins book.  Critics called it "a masterpiece of immense power and permanence" and "a bottomless text, so large-hearted that it can cause one to gasp with wonder and relief."  <p>

The heart of the program is a reading of the essential Gospel by ordinary people.  We took a 10,000 mile "spiritual road trip" to record these teachings on the lips -- and in the hearts -- of modern Americans: rich and poor, young and old, women and men, educated and uneducated, black, white, yellow, and brown.  This real-life "living gospel" will delight <b>believers and non-believers</b> alike.<p>

For the show's concluding segment, we've gathered reflections and comments from all kinds of people, including theologians, philosophers, psychologists, priests, rabbis, Zen masters, Muslim leaders, Native Americans, spiritual healers, conservatives, liberals and skeptics. The questions they ask and the issues they raise may help you on your own spiritual journey.<p>

The Gospel According to Jesus is a film by Emmy award-winning producer/director Norris J. Chumley which Wellspring co-produced. <p>

Many celebrities volunteered their time, since they love this project so much. Participants include: <p>

The Abyssinian Baptist Sanctuary Choir, Maya Angelou, Rev. Calvin Butts, Deepak Chopra, Judy Collins, Ram Dass, Shakti Gawain, Wavy Gravy, Rev. Andrew Greeley, Erica Jong, Sam Keen, Norman Lear, Stephen Mitchell, Estelle Parsons, Mary Kay Place, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Rabbi Zalman Schacter-Shalomi, Brother David Steindl-Rast, Marianne Williamson and many others. <p>

The Gospel According to Jesus is a two-tape set in a slip-case.  It also comes with a reprint of Stephen Mitchell's gospel translation. <b>$29.95</b>.  WSP 0129.<p>

<title>A New Video from Alan Watts</title>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif"><h2>Alan Watts: The Art of Meditation</h2> 
<hr noshade>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/wattsmed.gif" align=left><b>A personal meditation lesson from the great teacher who helped introduce Zen to the West. Also includes a bonus film: <i>Meditation, The Inward Journey.</i></b>
<p>
<dd><b><i>"An entrancing, seriously made film."</i></b> -- BOOKLIST
<p>
<hr width=100 noshade>
<p>
<blockquote><b><i>"Meditation is. ..the art of suspending verbal and symbolic thinking for a time, somewhat as a courteous audience will stop talking when a concert is 
about to begin." </i></b> ---  Alan Watts</blockquote>

Alan Watts is widely considered the West's formost interpreter of Eastern 
thought. Filmmaker Elda Hartley made several films with her friend from 
1965 until his death in 1973.  This captures Watts at his best:  in a 
thoughtful, step-by-step instruction on the meditative disciplines of 
body posture, breath control and concentration.  He leads us to the state 
of relaxation that "stops the chattering in the skull."
<p>
As a bonus, Elda has also included her film "Meditation: The Journey 
Inward," a thoughtful overview of how meditation is practiced by many 
cultures around the world -- Muslim, Buddhist, Sufi, Christian, and 
more.  This short film will give you a deeper understanding of the 
concepts you'll be practicing with Alan Watts.
<p>
Elda Hartley, now in her mid eighties, has been making films on health, 
spirituality and personal growth since 1965.  Her lifelong goal has been 
to promote an understanding of our interconnectedness that transcends 
race, religion, gender and national boundaries.

<title>Explore Japanese Sprituality</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/vidacc.gif">
<h2>Satori</h2> 
<hr noshade>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/satori.gif" align=left><b>In the meditation hall of a Zen monastery in Japan, the Master exhorts his students: 
<p>

<blockquote<b>	"Forget your work.<br> 
		Forget your family.<br>
		Forget everything. <br>
		Just sit."</b></b></blockquote>
<br clear=left>
<p>
<br>
The students, folded in lotus position, sit.  They struggle to empty 
their minds.  They struggle to attain satori.  For long and agonizing 
hours.
<p>
Satori is a sudden flash of intuitive enlightenment -- the spiritual goal 
of Zen Buddhism.  Like the philosophy it seeks to describe, this 
impressionistic film follows the natural rhythm of Japanese life, which 
swings like a pendulum between extrbes.  Now peaceful, now violent  -- 
with images and sounds that alternately soothe and agitate your senses.
<p>
<b>Satori</b> travels an un-Western itinerary.  It explores the Japanese 
approach to life, nature and work.  The camera ranges widely from the 
interior of a monastery to the Shintoist and Buddhist street festivals;  
from the Zen-based Kanrisha School of Business Managbent to a Shinto 
cerbony inside factory walls.
<p>
<b>Satori</b> challenges our Western way of thinking, and raises some 
interesting questions about our own society.  It will encourage the 
Westerner, who lives by force of logic, to explore a more intuitive, 
non-rational approach. <b>Satori</b> may open your mind to a new way of 
thinking -- a new way of being.

<title> DREAM WEAVER</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center><h2><b>DREAM WEAVER</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
    

Dreams have fascinated mankind since the beginning of time.  Ancient cultures
thought that dreams were the way the gods communicated with us.  Some of
history's greatest inventions -- like Einstein's theory of relativity -- had
their genesis in a dream.
<P>
While they may indeed seem mystical, dreams are really just nerve cells
firing in patterns similar to those you have when you're awake. Dream images
are largely symbolic, representing psychological and physiological things
that are going on within us.   They mirror back your deepest hopes and fears,
particularly when something important is on your mind. 
<P>
Dreams are fertile ground for resolving problems if you understand how to use
them.<BR>
There are several techniques you can harness that will allow you to use your
dream states to improve your life:
<P>
1) Keep a dream journal by your bed.  First thing when you wake up -- even if
its at   night -- write them down immediately.    If you always "forget" your
dreams, tell    yourself before you fall asleep that you will remember them.
<P>
2) If you are mulling over some issue, use the power of suggestion to trigger
a    dream related to it.  For example, if you're considering a job change,
tell     yourself during the day that  you will have dream about it that
night and receive    useful information through it.
<P>
3) Be aware of "dreamsigns."  If you often see a flying zebra in your dreams,
keep    track of it.   Then pay attention during your waking state for things
that may    correspond (maybe a zebra painted on the side of a delivery
truck).  Some feel    that if you dream of a specific food -- oranges, for
example -- your body is telling   you that you should eat more of it.  This
does not, however, apply to chocolate    cake!
<P>
4) Learn to "wake up" within the dream. This is called "lucid dreaming" and
allows    you to influence what's going on within the experience.  Practice
asking     yourself, "Am I dreaming?" when you're asleep (again, use the
autosuggestion    technique before sleep to remind yourself to do this).
  Once you recognize that    you are dreaming, allow yourself to explore it
rather than having      it seemingly control you.  For instance, you find
yourself on a beautiful mountain   top, looking down at a peaceful valley.
 Once you recognize that you're     dreaming, anything becomes possible:  you
can tell yourself to fly or have Fabio   show up to enjoy the view with you.
<P>
 Lucid dreaming is particularly useful if you want to practice a skill, such
as your    golf swing.   Use autosuggestion before falling asleep to tell
yourself to dream    about your golf game.  Once you recognize you're in the
dream, pay attention to   what you see and feel;  hopefully, you'll  wake up
with some new insights.
<P>
Learning to recall, interpret and control your dreams takes practice, so be
patient.<BR>
Once you've mastered the art, however, all you have to do to improve your
life is to sleep on it!
<P>

<title>CHEWING THE FAT-FREE FAT</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>CHEWING THE FAT-FREE FAT</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Ever wish you could bury your face in a bag of chips and not feel guilty the
next day?  You and everyone else.  That's why there's such a buzz around
"olestra", a fat substitute that's just been approved by the FDA.
 Originally intended as a cholesterol-lowering drug, olestra was invented 25
years ago.  Failing that test, the manufacturer regrouped and submitted it as
a fat substitute. 
<p>
Olestra works by passing through your body before calories or fat can be
absorbed.
It will be appearing in your supermarket in the form of chips and crackers.
How does it taste?  Most people think the olestra-fried stuff tastes pretty
much like the real thing.  The problem lies a little lower:  some people have
reported digestive problems and stomach cramps after eating olestra.  In
addition, it leaches fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, K and E, out of the
body as it passes through.  The manufacturer claims to have remedied these
problems in newer formulations.
<p>
Olestra may sound too good to be true, and in some ways, it is.  Nutritional
experts warn against thinking you're in "fat city" and can chow down on
unlimited quantities of the stuff.  They advise moderation with olestra
products and emphasize choosing healthier "real" foods over  processed
substitutes in your daily diet.

<h2><b>A GREEN TREAT FOR YOUR FEET!</b></h2>

<p>
Here's a delectable treat for tired, aching tootsies.  Cut up several large,
unpeeled cucumbers and use a blender to whip them into a mushy state.
 Refrigerate the mix until cold.  Take two pans, each large enough to
accommodate a foot, and pour the mix into equal parts.  Then just sit back
and wiggle your bare feet through the mush!

<html><head><title>MELATONIN:  A BEDTIME STORY?</title></HEAD><body bgcolor=#ffffff><img align=left src="../../gifs/newsacc.gif">
<p align=center>
<h2><b>MELATONIN:  A BEDTIME STORY?</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
A hormone called "melatonin" has been making headlines lately as a sort of natural sleeping pill.  Researchers testing it report that it makes people drop off to sleep faster and easier than commercial sleeping aids, and it doesn't have any unpleasant or dangerous side effects.   That kind of news has made a lot of people wake up fast and rush to the health food store.
<p>
But there's still a lot that's not understood about how melatonin works.  It's naturally manufactured in the pineal gland, serving as a sort of alarm clock.  When night falls, the dimming light hits the eye, which transmits to the gland.  Melatonin productivity 
increases, essentially telling the body that bedtime is near.  In the morning, when light begins to creep in,  melatonin production falls off, "waking up" the body.
<p>
As we age, we secrete less melatonin, one reason why older people have a hard time sleeping through the night (and why they're one of the biggest customers for the stuff).
<p>
So far, researchers feel that short term use of melatonin is fairly harmless.  In various studies using different doses of  melatonin, the only side effects  reported were headaches, nausea and chronic grogginess.  Some people reported intensely vivid dreams -- both the good kind, as well as nightmares.  One problem though, as with many natural supplements, is purity and quality control.    Many  melatonin supplements tend to wear off suddenly--so you fall asleep fast, but you also wake up at 3 in the morning.  
<p>
Another aspect of melatonin use is how it affects female reprodutivity.  Women's bodies are finely tuned to the seasons with their differing light levels.  Melatonin is secreted in higher amounts during certain times of the year.   In other animals,  this triggers things like mating and migration.  Researchers are still not sure how use of the supplement will impact on this natural cycle; in fact, some feel melatonin may also be useful as a contraceptive (so what, if you're fast asleep?). 
<p>
Despite skepticism among some pharmaceutical companies, many are engaged in heavy research in a rush to market the first quality-controlled melatonin-based sleep aid.  And for those among us who suffer jet lag or other sleeping problems, that would be an overnight sensation.

<h2><b>TURNING BACK THE CLOCK</b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
With  Medicare in the news,  everyone is aware of the cost of health care for
senior citizens.   For those of us not even close to retirement age, we may
wonder what the future holds for our own health care needs.   But what most
people overlook is the fact that aging doesn't have to mean sick, infirm,
"old and in the way." 
<p>
A message has been sent to older people that they should slow down, take it
easy and forget about vigorous physical activity .  Many of them accept that
message, and so muscles fall into disuse, coordination and balance go, and
bones become brittle.  In fact, 75% of hospitalization cases among the
elderly people are a result of falls.
<p>
Many of our older population are physically 20 years older than they are
chronologically.   Physiologically, there is no reason why people need to
slow down as they age.    The good news is that the body can bounce back from
inactivity.  It literally is "never too late" to start an exercise program.
<p>
Research shows that a balance of  simple aerobic exercise and light weight
training (such as 2-3 pound dumbbells) is a good prescription for almost
every senior.  The weight training is particularly important as it helps
maintain bone density.   Taking calcium or estrogen supplements is not
enough.  Bones get thicker only when they are used.
<p>
Remarkably, a gradual program of just 40 minutes a day, 3 times a week can
show results in an older body in just four weeks.
<p>
Besides the physical benefits of greater energy and body coordination,
working out allows seniors a glimpse of the tremendous physical and mental
potential they still  possess.  In the long term, this "preventive medicine"
will go much farther in reducing national medical costs and improving the
quality of life for the elderly.  Good enough reason to stay on the
Stairmaster as long as you can!

Estrogen has been in the news a lot lately as a sort of "fountain of youth"
pill for women reaching the age of menopause.  But many feel this is only
postponing a natural stage of a woman's life.   Holistic-minded doctors
recommend some natural treatments in dealing with the hot flashes, mood
swings and other physical discomforts of "the change."
<p>
1) For hot flashes, try taking two capsules a day of each of the following
herbs:     dong quai (also known as "female ginseng" for it's mildly
estrogenic     properties), chapparal and damiana.    Chapparal has
antioxidant properties,   while damiana is considered a tonic and female
aphrodisiac.  Take them until     the hot flashes cease altogether.
<p>
2) Keep physically active.  Regular exercise will help fight mood swings, and
keep    your body in general good tone. 
<p>
3) Keep a positive mental attitude.  Don't view this phase as an end to youth
and    sexuality.  Menopause is a natural transition.  Some women have even
said    that without a monthly cycle, they feel as free as they did when they
were kids.
<p>
Choose to view it as a healthy liberation.

<h2><b>The Judges Give Them a "65-Plus"
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
When was the last time you saw a 77- year old man flipping around on parallel
bars?  Or a group of women in their late 60's tumbling or walking the balance
beam? The "U of Agers" think you should see it more often, as this Canadian
gymnastics team  pushes the boundaries of what's physically expected of older
adults.
<p>
The "U of Agers" is composed of 21 men and women between 55 and 77.  Wearing
t-shirts that read "Get Off Your Rocker" or "Go to Health", the group trains
regularly with a coach, mastering the basics of gymnastics.    It's a sport
most of us view as the domain of youngsters, but this team is out to break
the rules.  Touring since 1986,  they demonstrate what's physically possible
for people "their age", even as society (and their children) encourage
seniors to slow down.    One member says, "People think, 'Oh, I'm 65...I
don't do that anymore.'  Well then what do you do if you don't do 'that'
anymore?"
<p>
The Agers are each convinced that keeping physically and mentally active is
the key to maintaining independence in old age.   Even if they can't achieve
the levels of physical performance they had at 25, they still seek activity
for the sheer pleasure of it.   One man states that perfection isn't the goal
for him anymore.  Adding a healthy twist to the slogan, "just do it", he
states "Anything worth doing, is worth doing badly."  For these folks who
would rather cartwheel than play canasta, gymnastics is the surprising
vehicle that helps spread the message  that  "There is no finish line."
<p>

<p align=center>
<h2><b>Power Napping 
 </b></h2>
<hr noshade>
<p>
It's typical to experience low energy levels around mid-afternoon, particulary since many of us are sleep-deprived to begin with.  That's the time many people hit the candy machine or the coffee bar for a pick me up.But researchers say a short nap is far better for you.

If you can manage it, a 15 or 20 minute nap will leave you far more refreshed and alert than anything else.  Avoid sleeping any longer than that, though; you'll just end up groggy for the rest of the day.  Napping too late in the
day can also make falling asleep at bedtime more difficult.

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><BR> <B>House-church members in China </B>say Deng Xiaoping was &quot;an unwitting instrument of God&quot; who helped bring the largest Christian revival in history to China, <I>Compass Direct</I> reported.  Unlike the Cultural Revolution from 1966-1976, when Bibles were burned, churches shut down, and pastors imprisoned, Deng's reforms resulted in less social control.   Deng allowed people to travel from province to province, meaning itinerant evangelism could start again, a Beijing house church leader told Compass.  He also replaced Maoist ideology with a more materialistic philosophy, prompting people to ask spiritual questions such as &quot;am I alive merely to buy a bigger television, or a better refrigerator?&quot; a house-church leader said. <BR> <B>...Deng tried to repress the church.  </B>His combination of freedom and repression provided opportunities for evangelism and challenged the church to grow, house groups leaders say. <BR> <B>...There are about 82 million Christians in China, </B>according to the Hong Kong-based Chinese Church Research Centre.  Under Deng, the church grew from an estimated one million believers in the late 1970s to 50 million by the late 1980s. <BR> <B>...More than 5,000 churches were reopened in the 1980s</B> by the state-dominated Three Self Patriotic Movement, China's official Protestant church.  Most Christians, however, worship away from its influence, in unofficial house churches.  In 1987 the United Bible Societies were allowed to build a printing press in Nanjing, which has since printed 13 million Bibles.  The need for Bibles still remains large.    <BR> <B>...China's religious policy is expected to remain repressive</B>.  Deng's likely successor, Jiang Zemin, 70, has taken an active role in controlling the church in recent years.  He launched a campaign in 1995 to force house churches to register under government control.  More than 300 pastors were arrested in 1996 for refusing to comply, three house church leaders were beaten to death, and long prison sentences were given to those convicted of printing the Bible underground.       </font></p>

"His bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob." 
<BR>
- Genesis 49:24
</I></CENTER>
<BR>
That strength which God gives to his Josephs is real strength; it is not a boasted valour, a fiction, a thing of which men talk, but which ends in smoke; it is true-divine strength. Why does Joseph stand against temptation? Because God gives him aid. There is nought that we can do without the power of God. All true strength comes from "the mighty God of Jacob." Notice in what a blessedly familiar way God gives this strength to Joseph-"The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob." Thus God is represented as putting his hands on Joseph's hands, placing his arms on Joseph's arms. Like as a father teaches his children, so the Lord teaches them that fear him. He puts his arms upon them. Marvellous condescension! God Almighty, Eternal, Omnipotent, stoops from his throne and lays his hand upon the child's hand, stretching his arm upon the arm of Joseph, that he may be made strong! This strength was also covenant strength, for it is ascribed to "the mighty God of Jacob." Now, wherever you read of the God of Jacob in the Bible, you should remember the covenant with Jacob. Christians love to think of God's covenant. All the power, all the grace, all the blessings, all the mercies, all the comforts, all the things we have, flow to us from the well-head, through the covenant. If there were no covenant, then we should fail indeed; for all grace proceeds from it, as light and heat from the sun. No angels ascend or descend, save upon that ladder which Jacob saw, at the top of which stood a covenant God. Christian, it may be that the archers have sorely grieved you, and shot at you, and wounded you, but still your bow abides in strength; be sure, then, to ascribe all the glory to Jacob's God.

"The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power." 
<BR>
- Nahum 1:3
</I></CENTER>
<BR>
Jehovah "is slow to anger." When mercy cometh into the world she driveth winged steeds; the axles of her chariot-wheels are red hot with speed; but when wrath goeth forth, it toileth on with tardy footsteps, for God taketh no pleasure in the sinner's death. God's rod of mercy is ever in his hands outstretched; his sword of justice is in its scabbard, held down by that pierced hand of love which bled for the sins of men. "The Lord is slow to anger," because he is GREAT IN POWER. He is truly great in power who hath power over himself. When God's power doth restrain himself, then it is power indeed: the power that binds omnipotence is omnipotence surpassed. A man who has a strong mind can bear to be insulted long, and only resents the wrong when a sense of right demands his action. The weak mind is irritated at a little: the strong mind bears it like a rock which moveth not, though a thousand breakers dash upon it, and cast their pitiful malice in spray upon its summit. God marketh his enemies, and yet he bestirs not himself, but holdeth in his anger. If he were less divine than he is, he would long ere this have sent forth the whole of his thunders, and emptied the magazines of heaven; he would long ere this have blasted the earth with the wondrous fires of its lower regions, and man would have been utterly destroyed; but the greatness of his power brings us mercy. Dear reader, what is your state this evening? Can you by humble faith look to Jesus, and say, "My substitute, thou art my rock, my trust"? Then, beloved, be not afraid of God's power; for by faith you have fled to Christ for refuge, the power of God need no more terrify you, than the shield and sword of the warrior need terrify those whom he loves. Rather rejoice that he who is "great in power" is your Father and Friend.

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The underground church in Vietnam is growing rapidly</B>, a group of American visitors to Southeast Asia say.  Christians from northern California said the underground churches have doubled in size in just 18 months.  A renewal that started in Saigon reportedly has spread to central and northern provinces as well as to tribal areas. <BR><B>...&quot;Pastors have reported continuous miracles, healings</B>, and deliverances,&quot; one of the Americans said.  &quot;Large numbers of believers now have offered themselves for full time service.  Some have had dreams and visions calling them into distant lands. Some have gone already into Cambodia and Laos preaching the Gospel where other tribal groups exist.&quot; <BR><B>...Vietnamese Christians have started an underground printing press,</B> delivered a thousand Bibles to tribal pastors, and established preaching points in fourteen tribal areas, the American was told. <P> <B>Bible Societies and other Bible translation organizations</B> around the world produced Christian scriptures in 39 more languages in 1996.  This brings the total number of languages in the world that have Christian scriptures to 2,167 -- about one-third of the total known languages, according to the Bible Society in New Zealand. <P> <B>Portugal's parliament rejected liberalizing the country's abortion law.  </B>Lawmakers voted 112-111 against a proposed law that would have allowed unrestricted abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks.  Another bill, which extended the period in which abortions can be carried out in cases of a deformed fetus from 16 to 24 weeks, was approved. <P> <B>Accordion music helps prisoners calm down and turn to God</B>, according to Baptist minister and Salvation Army volunteer Ralph Bailey.  He has been playing at the Middlesex County jail in New Brunswick, N.J. for 40 years.  <I>Amazing Grace</I> is the favorite among inmates, because it deals with a lost soul who finds redemption, said Bailey, 78.  The accordion &quot;seems to reach their souls more quickly than words ever could,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Switzerland's Catholic bishops condemned as sacrilegious</B> a movie poster that depicts pornographer Larry Flynt in a crucifixion pose against the backdrop of a bikini-clad woman.  &quot;It is reprehensible to violate the religious feelings of Christians for whom the person of Jesus Christ is sacred,&quot; the Swiss bishops said.  Their comments came one day after French judges refused to ban the posters for <I>The People vs. Larry Flynt</I> after complaints that they offended Christians.  The poster was rejected by the Motion Picture Association of America. <P> <B>Two former Ku Klux Klan members were given 18 and 19-year prison terms</B> in Charleston, S.C., on Thursday for the 1995 burning of two black churches.  Gary Cox, 23, and Timothy Welch, 24, pleaded guilty to burning Macedonia Baptist Church in Bloomville, S.C., and Mount Zion AME Church in Greelyville, S.C., Reuters news service reported.  They apologized for their acts before they were sentenced, and gave information to federal investigators that led to the arrests of two men for providing flammable liquids used to accelerate the fires.    </font></font></p>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The underground church in Vietnam is growing rapidly</B>, a group of American visitors to Southeast Asia say.  Christians from northern California said the underground churches have doubled in size in just 18 months.  A renewal that started in Saigon reportedly has spread to central and northern provinces as well as to tribal areas. <BR><B>...&quot;Pastors have reported continuous miracles, healings</B>, and deliverances,&quot; one of the Americans said.  &quot;Large numbers of believers now have offered themselves for full time service.  Some have had dreams and visions calling them into distant lands. Some have gone already into Cambodia and Laos preaching the Gospel where other tribal groups exist.&quot; <BR><B>...Vietnamese Christians have started an underground printing press,</B> delivered a thousand Bibles to tribal pastors, and established preaching points in fourteen tribal areas, the American was told. <P> <B>Bible Societies and other Bible translation organizations</B> around the world produced Christian scriptures in 39 more languages in 1996.  This brings the total number of languages in the world that have Christian scriptures to 2,167 -- about one-third of the total known languages, according to the Bible Society in New Zealand. <P> <B>Portugal's parliament rejected liberalizing the country's abortion law.  </B>Lawmakers voted 112-111 against a proposed law that would have allowed unrestricted abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks.  Another bill, which extended the period in which abortions can be carried out in cases of a deformed fetus from 16 to 24 weeks, was approved. <P> <B>Accordion music helps prisoners calm down and turn to God</B>, according to Baptist minister and Salvation Army volunteer Ralph Bailey.  He has been playing at the Middlesex County jail in New Brunswick, N.J. for 40 years.  <I>Amazing Grace</I> is the favorite among inmates, because it deals with a lost soul who finds redemption, said Bailey, 78.  The accordion &quot;seems to reach their souls more quickly than words ever could,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Switzerland's Catholic bishops condemned as sacrilegious</B> a movie poster that depicts pornographer Larry Flynt in a crucifixion pose against the backdrop of a bikini-clad woman.  &quot;It is reprehensible to violate the religious feelings of Christians for whom the person of Jesus Christ is sacred,&quot; the Swiss bishops said.  Their comments came one day after French judges refused to ban the posters for <I>The People vs. Larry Flynt</I> after complaints that they offended Christians.  The poster was rejected by the Motion Picture Association of America. <P> <B>Two former Ku Klux Klan members were given 18 and 19-year prison terms</B> in Charleston, S.C., on Thursday for the 1995 burning of two black churches.  Gary Cox, 23, and Timothy Welch, 24, pleaded guilty to burning Macedonia Baptist Church in Bloomville, S.C., and Mount Zion AME Church in Greelyville, S.C., Reuters news service reported.  They apologized for their acts before they were sentenced, and gave information to federal investigators that led to the arrests of two men for providing flammable liquids used to accelerate the fires.    </font></font></p>

 <b>WASHINGTON</b>--AN AMERICAN ANALYST ON ASIA SAYS U-S SECRETARY OF STATE 
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT'S STOPS IN ASIAN CAPITALS UNDERSCORES 
AMERICA'S VITAL SECURITY INTERESTS IN THE REGION.  V-O-A'S VICTOR
BEATTIE REPORTS DOUGLAS PAAL OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC POLICY CENTER 
SAYS THE TRIP COMES AS RELATIONS WITH CHINA ARE ON THE REBOUND 
AFTER TENSIONS FLARED OVER TAIWAN, HUMAN RIGHTS AND ARMS 
PROLIFERATION:

<P>
 MR. PAAL, A FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIAL IN THE 
REAGAN AND BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS, SAYS RELATIONS REACHED A LOW 
POINT LATE IN 1995.  HE POINTS TO TAIWAN PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI'S
VISIT TO A U-S COLLEGE FOLLOWED BY CHINESE MISSILE TESTS OFF 
TAIWAN AND ACCUSATIONS CHINA SOLD WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY TO THIRD 
COUNTRIES:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><P>
          AT THAT POINT, EVERYONE DREW A BREATH AND SAID, 'ENOUGH,
         TIME TO START TALKING.' AND, SINCE THEN, WE'VE HAD AN 
         EFFORT BY THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA A MORE SYSTEMIC, 
         STRATEGIC DIALOGUE.   
<P>
 </BLOCKQUOTE><P>
 MS. ALBRIGHT'S VISIT TO BEIJING MONDAY CONTINUES THAT DIALOGUE 
WITH THE HIGH-POINT A SCHEDULED PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT LATER THIS

          THERE'S SOME LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN AND
         I THINK MS. ALBRIGHT WILL BE LENDING SUPPORT TO PRIME 
         MINISTER (RYUTARO) HASHIMOTO'S EFFORTS TO GET THAT 
         LEGISLATION THROUGH JAPAN'S DIET.

ON THE STORY.

<P>
 PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE FILED INTO CHINA'S DE FACTO 
EMBASSY IN HONG KONG TO PAY THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO DENG XIAOPING.
THE MOURNERS, INCLUDING POLITICIANS, BUDDHIST MONKS, SCHOOL 
CHILDREN AND ELDERLY MEN AND WOMAN, BOWED BEFORE A BLACK AND 
WHITE PHOTOGRAPH OF MR. DENG. FLOWERED WREATHS DECORATED WITH 
BLACK RIBBONS LINED THE ROOM. SOME OF THE MOURNERS FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT TO HOLD BACK THEIR GRIEF.

 OFFICIALS AT CHINA'S DE FACTO EMBASSY SAY MORE THAN  12-THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE COME TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CHINESE LEADER SINCE 
THE EMBASSY IN HONG KONG OPENED ITS DOORS LAST THURSDAY. THE 
MEMORIAL SERVICE WILL CONTINUE HERE UNTIL MONDAY, THE DAY BEFORE 
MR. DENG'S FUNERAL IN BEIJING.
<P>
 MANY PEOPLE IN HONG KONG HOLD SPECIAL ADMIRATION FOR DENG 
XIAOPING BECAUSE HE IS CREDITED WITH MASTERMINDING THE ONE 
COUNTRY -- TWO SYSTEMS CONCEPT. THE IDEA THAT HONG KONG CAN 
MAINTAIN ITS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEM AND STILL BE 
PART OF CHINA. THE CONCEPT WILL BE PUT INTO PRACTICE JULY FIRST 
WHEN THE TERRITORY REVERTS TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY. (SIGNED)

 <b>MEXICO CITY</b>--A MEXICAN DRUGS BUSTING ARMY GENERAL WHO IS BEHIND BARS 
ACCUSED OF HELPING THE COUNTRY'S MOST POWERFUL DRUGS TRAFFICKER, 
HAS DENIED THAT HE GAVE INTO CORRUPTION.  JAMES BLEARS REPORTS.

<P>
 GENERAL JESUS GUTIERREZ ROBOLLO, WHO IS HEAD OF THE 
NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COMBATTING DRUGS, HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND IS
BEHIND BARS IN MEXICO'S MOST SECURE JAIL- ALMALOYA DE JUAREZ, IN 
THE STATE OF MEXICO.
<P>
 HE IS ACCUSED OF COCAINE TRAFFICKING, GRAFT AND ASSOCIATION WITH 
AMADO CARILLO FUENTES -- ALIAS LORD OF THE SKIES, WHO IS THE HEAD
OF THE JUAREZ DRUGS CARTEL.  AUTHORITIES SAY THAT CARILLO IS THE 
MOST POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS DRUG TRAFFICKER STILL ON THE RUN IN 
MEXICO.
<P>
 THE MEXICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS ACCUSING GENERAL 
GUTIERREZ REBOLLO OF RECEIVING LARGE BUT UNSPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF 
AMERICAN DOLLARS, PLUS CARS AND PROPERTY FROM EDUARDO GONZALEZ, 
WHO THEY SAY IS THE RIGHT HAND MAN OF CARILLO.  THEY ALSO SAY 
THAT THE GENERAL WAS LIVING IN A MEXICO CITY LUXURY APARTMENT 
BELONGING TO THE DRUG BOSS.
<P>
 THE GENERAL HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT FROM HIS PRISON CELL.  HE SAYS
THAT HIS ASSOCIATION WITH MR. GONZALEZ WAS CULTIVATED FOR ONE 
PURPOSE ONLY -- TO LOCATE AND ARREST CARILLO.  AND HE SAID HE HAD
ISSUED THREE ARREST WARRENTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE JUST THAT 
PURPOSE.
<P>
 THIS ASSOCIATION WITH GONZALEZ DATES BACK TO WHEN THE GENERAL WAS
COMMANDER OF THE 5TH MILITARY REGION BASED IN GUADALAJARA, PRIOR 
TO HIS LATEST APPOINTMENT IN DECEMBER.  
<P>
 THE GENERAL SAID THAT HE HAD PAID THE EQUIVALENT OF 13 HUNDRED 
DOLLARS RENT FOR THE APARTMENT OUT OF HIS 48 HUNDRED DOLLAR 
MONTHLY SALARY.  HE ALSO REVEALED THAT EVERY FOUR MONTHS HIS JOB 
BROUGHT HIM CERTAIN FRINGE BENEFITS, BUT THE GENERAL REFUSED TO 
SPECIFY THEM.  HE IS DUE TO ANNOUNCE A MORE DETAILED STATEMENT ON
TUESDAY.
<P>
 THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES ARE OPENLY SKEPTICAL OF THE GENERAL'S 
EXPLANATION ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP WITH A KNOWN ASSOCIATE OF 
MEXICO'S MOST DANGEROUS DRUGS CRIMINAL.  THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 
HAS PUBLICLY DENOUNCED HIM, ACCUSING HIM OF BETRAYING THE LOYALTY
AND HONOR OF THE MEXICAN ARMY.
<P>
 GENERAL GUTIERREZ REBOLLO IS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF MEXICAN 
MILITARY LAW AND ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 22 OF THE CONSTITUTION IF 
FOUND GUILTY, HE COULD FACE THE DEATH SENTENCE.  IT IS HOWEVER, 
MOST UNLIKELY THAT THIS SANCTION WOULD BE CARRIED OUT, ALTHOUGH 
HE COULD EXPECT A HEFTY PRISON SENTENCE. (SIGNED)

 <b>SEOUL</b>--U-S SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT WELCOMES NORTH 
KOREA'S DECISION TO ATTEND A JOINT BRIEFING BY THE UNITED STATES 
AND SOUTH KOREA ON PEACE TALKS.  FROM SEOUL SHIN NA REPORTS ON 
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT'S VISIT TO SOUTH KOREA WHERE SHE ALSO 
DISCUSSED A NUCLEAR POWER AGREEMENT FOR THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

<P>
 U-S SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT SAID SATURDAY 
SHE IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MOVES TOWARD A PERMANENT PEACE ON THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA.  NORTH KOREA HAS AGREED TO ATTEND A BRIEFING BY
THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA ON PEACE TALKS PROPOSED LAST 
YEAR BY PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT KIM 
YOUNG-SAM.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><P>
          OUR TWO PRESIDENTS HAD MET LAST SUMMER AND BELIEVED THAT
         THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO PURSUE PEACE ON THE 
         PENINSULA IS TO HAVE THESE FOUR-PARTY TALKS.  WE BELIEVE
         THAT THE BRIEFING ABOUT THEM IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE, AS 
         I ANNOUNCED, IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD.
<P>
 </BLOCKQUOTE><P>
 NORTH KOREA ANNOUNCED FRIDAY IT WILL ATTEND THE BRIEFING IN NEW 
YORK ON MARCH FIFTH.  THE DECISION CAME ONE DAY AFTER SEOUL SAID 
IT WOULD PROVIDE SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FOOD AID TO THE NORTH 
THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD FOOD PROGRAM.  THE UNITED STATES
HAS PLEDGED AN ADDITIONAL 10 MILLION DOLLARS IN AID.  
<P>
 DURING A JOINT PRESS BRIEFING AFTER TALKS WITH SOUTH KOREAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER YOO CHONG-HA, SECRETARY ALBRIGHT STRESSED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING A 1994 NUCLEAR AGREEMENT ON TRACK.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><P>
          THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND I DISCUSSED THE NEED TO KEEP 
         THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT ON SCHEDULE, 
         INCLUDING THE LIGHTWATER REACTOR CONSTRUCTION DESPITE 
         SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS OF DEALING WITH THE NORTH.
<P>
 </BLOCKQUOTE><P>
 SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER YOO DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN 
NORTH KOREA AS "FLUID" AND "VOLATILE," AND SAID ARMED CLASHES ON 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA MUST BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.
<P>
 U-S SECRETARY ALBRIGHT'S VISIT TO SOUTH KOREA COMES AS 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP REACHES A HIGH 
POINT WITH RECENT CHANGES WITHIN THE RULING HEIRARCHY.  
<P>
 IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS, THREE HIGH-LEVEL POSITIONS IN THE NORTH 
KOREAN GOVERNMENT SAW CHANGES WITH THE DEFECTION OF A WORKERS' 
PARTY SECRETARY, THE DISMISSAL OF THE PRIME MINISTER, AND THE 
DEATH OF THE DEFENSE MINISTER.  
<P>
 NORTH KOREA WATCHERS HERE SAY THE GAPS LEFT IN THE NORTH KOREAN 
LEADERSHIP BY THESE TOP OFFICIALS GIVES DE FACTO LEADER KIM 
JONG-IL ROOM TO FILL THE POSTS WITH A YOUNGER GENERATION THAT IS 
MORE LOYAL TO HIM AND THE MILITARY.
<P>
 DURING HER FIRST VISIT TO SOUTH KOREA AS SECRETARY OF STATE, 
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT MET WITH THE FOREIGN MINSITER, PAID A COURTESY
CALL TO SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT KIM YOUNG-SAM, AND VISITED U-S AND
SOUTH KOREAN TROOPS ON THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE THAT SEPARATES THE

<LI><B>Is this a free service?</B> Yes. Basic entries into the Help Wanted/Classifieds system are completely free of charge. The only charges would be for extended runs, graphic (display) ads, or banner ads.
<P>
<LI><B>How long does my ad run for?</B> Ads are run for a 30-day period from initial entry into the system. Extended runs can be setup for a nominal fee.
<P>
<LI><B>Can I post my ad in multiple sections?</B>  Yes, but you'll have to do it manually (use your BACK function and change the category). We ask that you only place your ads in relevant areas. Since we screen all ads for content, we will detect abuses of the system and remove all ads from a repeated abuser.
<P>
<LI><B>Do you screen ads before they are posted?</B> Yes. In order to preserve standards, quality, and usefulness the staff at GOSHEN screens each ad before it is accepted into the system. Any problem ads are removed.
<P>
<LI><B>Can I use HTML tags in my ads?</B> Yes, however, we have tried to limit the use of tags to font color changes plus bold/italic markup changes. Ads that use other tags will not be added to the system.
<P>
