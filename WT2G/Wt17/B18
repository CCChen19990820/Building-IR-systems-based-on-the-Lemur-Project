<P>
<B>Germany after World War Two was subject to a very strict aid conditionality
under the Marshall Plan. When it became a donor of aid itself,
it gradually introduced conditions connected with its aid. Today,
aid conditionality is accepted as a concept by government, NGOs
and the public.</B>
<P>
Before the role of conditionality attached to German development
aid can be analysed it has to be realized that the Federal Republic
of Germany itself was exposed to severe conditionality during
the Marshall Plan period after World War II. Contrary to general
belief it was not so much the amount of money transferred to the
Western European countries which made this exercise &quot;history's
most successful structural adjustment programme&quot;, but rather
the strict conditionality attached to it. Each recipient had to
sign a bilateral pact with the United States in which they agreed
to balance government budgets, restore financial stability and
stabilise exchange rates at realistic levels. In addition for
every dollar of Marshall Plan aid received, the recipient country
was required to place a matching amount of domestic currency in
a counterpart fund to be used only for purposes approved by the
U.S. government.
<P>
<B>The emerging political conditionality</B>
<P>
When Germany switched from an aid recipient to an aid donor in
the early 1960s, there was a first attempt at political conditionality
by connecting diplomatic relations and development aid with the
nonrecognition of the German Democratic Republic. This was not
successful at all, since in the end the Federal Republic had to
accept that the GDR became a member of the United Nations.
<P>
A second attempt, which was much more in line with international
trends began in the early 1980s when development aid was linked
to human rights and democracy. In 1982 the federal parliament
(Bundestag) stated in a unanimous resolution: &quot;ln its development
cooperation the Federal Republic of Germany regards the implementation
of human rights as an essential goal of the federal government...
those countries
should be especially supported, which try to establish democratic
structures... In states where despotism, intimidation and physical
threat characterize~the relationship between the governing and
the governed only those projects can be supported which benefit
directly the oppressed population.&quot;
<P>
Although two years later the Bundestag adopted again unanimously
guidelines for the federal government stating that the goal for
development cooperation should be to guarantee a life in dignity
(securing basic needs) and to contribute to a higher level of
civil and political rights in developing countries the ministry
for economic cooperation did not really react to these resolutions
and left the human rights policy to a large extent to the foreign
office.
<P>
It was only five years later, when political reforms in countries
with structural adjustment processes seemed to be unavoidable
and especially after the collapse of the socialist states in Eastern
Europe that political conditionality and &quot;help through intervention&quot;
were discussed in Germany. Finally in October 1991, the minister
of economic cooperation, Carl-Dieter Spranger, publicly announced
five criteria for German development cooperation: respect for
human rights, popular participation in the political process,
observation of the rule of law, market friendly approach to economic
development and the recipient government's commitment to development.
Thus the first three criteria constitute a clear political conditionality
based on the respect for human rights and an orientation towards
democracy.
<P>
<B>The administration of the political conditionality</B>
<P>
In order to ensure that the criteria were applied in the country
aid allocations the development policy section developed a
<P>
check list of indicators. As far as the first three human rights
related criteria were concerned it was made sure that all indica
tors were based on internationally codified UN human rights like
freedom from torture equality before the law or freedom of as
sembly so that no recipient country could object on the ground
of being subjugated to German standards. Also in this checklis
there is a clear distinction between the as sessment of the current
status of respect for human rights in a given country and the
tendency in the human rights performance which is considered even
more important.
<P>
The introduction of the human rights criteria for country allocations
also led to an increased support for human rights and democracy
projects, the so called &quot;positive measures&quot;. Especially
the foundations ol the major political parties but also church
organizations and other NGOs have a long tradition of projects
to strengthen the civil society of developing countries like support
for trade unions, chambers of commerce, human rights groups, etc.
Now the ministry also engages directly in such positive measures
like strengthening the legal system, demobilisation and reintegration
of soldiers (Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nicaragua) or decentralisation
and communal development. The Foreign Office is converting a fund
which was formerly used for military aid and training of policemen
into a source for positive measures like supporting free elections,
consulting services for parliaments or seminars on democratic
constitutions.
<P>
The major administrative instrument for the implementation of
a human rights orientation is the country concept. There has been
a major effort to draw up such concepts for about 40 countries.
Besides the usual economic analysis they also have to deal with
social and political conditions and should explicitly refer to
the situation and trends in relation to the five criteria. The
country concepts are the basis for decisions in relation to country
allocations and serve as a basis for government to government
consultations.
<P>
A recent assessment of these concepts by the policy section of
the ministry revealed that the implementation of the new criteria
within the administration is quite a complicated process and will
take some time. It is however hoped that a series of internal
training workshops will improve the quality of the country concepts.
<P>
<B>Conditionality and the German public</B>
<P>
The reception of the new criteria for development aid in the German
public was very positive, the opposition in parliament could only
state that they would watch their implementation and even the
most critical NGOs did not reject the criteria but criticised
the double standards applied in their implementation. Even with
the &quot;ordinary voter&quot; not very much interested inThird
World affairs, this new policy was quite popular under the slogan
that no taxpayer's money should be given to dictators who oppress
their own people or to corrupt regimes, which use development
money for their private purposes. There was no criticism from
the private sector, as far as the general policy guidelines were
concerned, different interests of the business community were
however very relevant at the implementation stage in certain economically
important countries (see below the case of China).
<P>
<B>Some case studies</B>
<P>
As a human rights conditionality in German development cooperation
can only be observed since the announcement of the five new criteria
in October 1991 just a first tentative assessment of the implementation
of this new policy can he given. Already in the country allocations
for the 1992 budget there were a number of changes which exceeded
by far the usually very minor variations. Thus countries like
China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan saw their allocations substantially
reduced either because of human rights violations or because of
excessive arms spending. With Zaire, Malawi, Togo and Haiti development
cooperation was stopped because of very strong human rights violations
and obstruction of the process towards democracy.
<P>
On the other hand countries where civil wars had ended saw their
development aid resumed or newly started (Ethiopia, El Salvador,
Namibia) and countries that had implemented democratic reforms
like Benin, Zambia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Chile had their aid
allocations substantially increased. However for countries like
Turkey, where human rights violations continue and spending on
arms is high, allocations were not changed at all.
<P>
A very instructive case, which shows that aid conditionality can
work, is Kenya. When in 1990 and 1991 the opposition to the repressive KANU one-party
system was mounting and people were more and more demanding a
multi-party system and the respect for human rights, it was the
German ambassador together with his American colleague, who was
openly supporting the drive towards democracy and the application
of aid conditionality. Finally in November 1991 the Western donors
with the exception of France decided during a meeting of the Consultative
Group for Kenya to suspend any quick disbursing aid until the
multi-party system was reestablished, corruption was reduced and
economic reforms implemented.
<P>
Within a few days president Moi announced that article 2a of the
constitution declaring Kenya a one-party state would be abolished
and free elections be held. Although these elections were far
from being fair and although the KANU regime was able to stay
in power, there is no doubt that in comparison to the pre-1991
situation the human rights situation has improved considerably.
<P>
A very interesting case that shows the limits of applying conditionality
in development cooperation is China. After the massacre on the
Tianmen square in June 1989 the German Parliament decided unanimously
that development cooperation should be stopped with the exception
of projects &quot;that directly benefit the population&quot;.
On October 30, 1990 the Bundestag with the majority of the coalition
parties voted for a limited resumption of development cooperation
adding projects &quot;for the protection of the environment and
projects which contribute to the reform of the Chinese economy&quot;.
This change was justified with the necessity for protection of
the environment and with the constructive position of China in
the Iraq conflict.
<P>
Based on the amended resolution of the Bundestag minister Spranger
in November 1991 refused his signature for a special financial
arrangement for a contract for container ships which were to be
built in an EastGerman shipyard, because none of the exceptions
of the Bundestag resolution would apply. After continued criticism
from members of the coalition reflecting mainly massive economic
interests, the majority in the Bundestag in June 1992 cancelled
its resolution of October 1990 enabling the government to finance
the shipbuilding contract on preferential terms. The arguments
were that although the respect for civil and political rights
was very poor the improvement of economic and social rights was
very impressive, that economic reforms would eventually lead to
improvements in the human rights situation, that China was of
high security interest and that other countries were ready to
capture the big export contract. Although the ministry did reduce
its aid allocation for China by DM 40 million, major improvements
of the human rights situation could not be observed.
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
The major experience with the human rights conditionality in German
development cooperation was that this policy can be implemented
with good success in countries which depend heavily on foreign
aid and where economic and foreign policy interests are minimal.
There is little chance for success in economically important or
strategically interesting countries. This has led to severe criticism
in the German public accusing the government of &quot;double standards&quot;.
As a consequence greater &quot;coherence&quot; of all policies
towards developing countries is demanded, which means that development
policy should have a higher priority than economic or security
interests.
<P>
This demand, however, would have to be based on strong political
support in the German public and in important interestgroups.
Although development aspects have in general increased in importance
after the disappearance of the EastWest conflict, other interests
like preservation of jobs or economic development of Eastern Germany
have a much higher priority and will have higher priority for
quite some time.
<P>
The basic question is then: should one accept &quot;double standards&quot;
in relation to political conditionality and try to slowly increase
the number of countries where development orientation has highest
priority orshould one postpone in amore puristway the application
of a human rights oriented conditionality even in those small
countries where it is implementable and wait until such time when
human rights conditionality can be successfully introduced in
all countries? Since such a policy would be at the cost of potential
improvement of human rights and democracy in many countriesthe
answer that human rights and development oriented NGOs in Germany
give is to support the political conditionality where it is sincerely
applied and to to use the &quot;double standards&quot; argument
as political pressure to increase the application of political
conditionality in as many countries as possible.

<B>1 PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA</B>

<P>

When the European Parliament meets in full plenary session on

20 to 24 May in Strassbourg they will find the agenda packed with

aid-related issues.  Included for discussion are

<UL>

<LI>The agreement for cooperation between the EU and MERCOSUR

<LI>A report on rehabilitation and reconstruction in developing

countries (already approved by the development committee this

week)

<LI>A report on the management of food aid and the development

of food security (already approved by the development committee

this week)

<LI>A report on humanitarian aid outside of the EU (already approved

by the development committee this week)

<LI>A communication from the commission to the parliament concerning

the future of economic aid to Jordan and the Ghaza strip

<LI>A report on the fisheries agreement between the EU and Mauritania

<LI>A report on aid for population programmes and policies in

developing countries

</UL>



<P>



<P>

<B>2 BANANAS ESCALATION OF THE CONFLICT</B>

<P>

Controversy still surrounds the commissions proposals for reform

of the banana importation quotas to take account of the accession

of Austria, Finland and Sweden to membership of the union.  The

commission has proposed that the quota be increased by 353,000

tonnes, and that this additional quota be given exclusively to

dollar banana importers.  This denies any of the new quota to

ACP producers and reduces the ACP share of the overall quota (2.553

million tonnes) from 30% to 26%.  The proposal has managed to

please no one.  For the Germans, who are supported by Belgium,

Denmark, Holland and Luxembourg, the increase in quota is not

enough.  They also want to see even more of the overall quota

going to cheap Latin American producers.  On the other side of

the argument, the UK, France, Spain and Portugal are fighting

to maintain the ACPs share of the banana quota.  

<P>

The stalemate is now overshadowed by the fact that the United

States, which has for a long time been complaining about the system

of preferences offered by the EU to ACP banana producers, has

started proceedings to refer the issue to a panel of the World

Trade Organisation.  The American complaint is similar to that

of the Germans.  They want to see a larger quota - up to 2.9 million

tonnes - and greater access for American producers.  Between the

German desire for cheap bananas and the American insistence of

access to the EU market, the ACP quota is looking increasingly

vulnerable.  Mickey Cantor, the United States Trade Representative,

is reported to be very confident of winning at least part of its

complaint.  This would leave the EU liable to pay compensation

to the USA if it did not comply with the ruling of the WTO panel.

<P>

<B>3 FUTURE OF LOME CONVENTION</B>

<P>

The discussions on the future of the Lom&eacute; Convention are

taking place in many different forums.  Some more open than others.

 On the weekend of May 4 to 5 a small group from DGVIII, the development

Commission of the European Union, will travel to Abidjan for a

48 hour informal discussion on what happens after 1999.  They

will spend their weekend in intense conversation with leading

members of the African business and political community in a spirit

of exploring all possible avenues.  Hopefully those of us who

are not members of such elite circles will have a chance to input

to the discussions before everything is signed and sealed.

<P>

<B>4 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE</B>

<P>

The development committee of the European Parliament met in Brussels

this week for two days.  The committee adopted three major reports

on humanitarian aid, food security, and rehabilitation and reconstruction

<UL>

<LI>Humanitarian aid<BR>

The committee adopted the position of the council, which defines

the scope of humanitarian activities and the legal basis

<LI>Food Security<BR>

All food aid should seek to encourage the future self-sufficiency

of the populations in current need

<LI>Rehabilitation and Reconstruction<BR>

covering all areas of rehabiltation and reconstruction, which

should be seen as preparing the way for future development work

in the medium to long term

</UL>



<P>



<P>

Emma Bonino, Commissioner with responsibility for ECHO, spoke

to the committee.  In response to a question about ECHOs approach

to the question of women in emergencies, Ms Bonino said that ECHO

would be producing a report on the subject but that it would only

cover women in refugee situations.  

<P>

<B>5 RWANDA NEGATIVE NGO EVALUATION</B>

<P>

The Rwandan government's project to assess the work of all international

NGOs in Rwanda is nearing completion.  We have seen an early draft

of their report which takes a decidedly negative tone.  NGOs are

criticised for being wasteful, for not achieving their stated

objectives, and for working outside of the government structures,

particularly communal and provincial authorities.  Individual

NGOs are dealt with in detail in the report.  However, the quality

of the criticism is not always very high.  One NGO running a centre

for unaccompanied children is criticised for not sending a child

to a specialist hospital in USA where he could have undergone

intensive heart surgery.

<P>

The committee which produced the report contains a representative

from UNDP and from one international NGO.  However, the process

of research and reporting was largely dominated by the official

Rwandese members of the committee.  Given the recent history of

expulsion of NGOs from their operations in Rwanda, there is some

concern over the use which the RPF government will make of such

a negative report.  Meanwhile <I>Eurostep</I>'s own position paper

on the Great Lakes crisis will shortly be released, following

official endorsement.

<h2>BRITAIN CONTINUES AID TO KURDISH VILLAGES IN NORTHERN IRAQ</h2>

<b>Britain is to provide an aid grant of £1.8 million to rehabilitate villages in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq.  The grant will enable Save the Children to continue their work with Kurdish families returning to their native villages. An estimated 4,000 villages have been destroyed in northern Iraq since 1975.</b><p>


The grant is designed to help villages become self-sustaining: services such as feeder roads, irrigation, drinking water, latrine blocks, schools and clinics will be provided.  Where appropriate flour mills, smithies and mechanical services will also be rehabilitated.  The project will target over 1,770 families, offering each family a voucher worth £150 to be exchanged against goods.  <p>


<h3>NOTE FOR EDITORS</h3>

The ODA's total expenditure on humanitarian aid to Iraqi civilians is over £70 million since April 1991.  This includes over £6.2 million to Save the Children for a variety of projects.<p>

<title>Ethics and Accountability in the African Civil Service</title>
</header>
<hr>
<H3><center><img src="../images/dpmf.jpg"><p></a>
Ethics and Accountability in the African Civil Service</h3>
by <i>Sadig Rasheed</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 3(1) August 1995: pages 12-14</i>
<p>
</center>
<hr>
Measures to enhance ethics and accountability often feature prominently as part of the agenda
of civil service reform in developing and developed countries. In recent years, the debate on
and efforts to curb ethical violations and enforce accountability have intensified in Africa
mainly due to four reasons:
<ul>
<li>the increase in the incidence of unethical practices and lack of accountability;
<p>
<li>the wave of political liberalisation, that engulfed most of Africa since 1989, which has
emboldened a budding civil society into demanding greater enforcement of ethical standards
and the punishment of violators;
<p>
<li>a growing recognition that unethical practices have contributed to the economic difficulties
that many African countries face; and
<p>
<li>the pressure exerted by international donors requiring stricter adherence by African
countries to good governance and the curtailment of waste and squandering of resources.
</ul>
The lack of accountability, unethical behaviour and corrupt practices have become so
pervasive, and even institutionalised norms of behaviour in Africa, to the extent that one may
conveniently speak of a crisis of ethics in African public services. While one could single out
a few countries, such as Namibia and Botswana, in which 'tolerable' levels of corruption
exists, unfortunately the opposite is true in the majority of African countries. Aside from
outright bribery and corruption, patronage, nepotism, embezzlement, influence peddling, use
of one's position for self-enrichment, bestowing of favours on relatives and friends,
moonlighting, partiality, absenteeism, late coming to work, abuse of public property, leaking
and/or abuse of government information and the like are common manifestation of this plight.
<p>
The obvious negative impact of such practices on productivity; the responsiveness, legitimacy
and transparency of governments; the effective implementation of policies; and efforts to bring
about recovery and development in general dictate that concerted action by all concerned must
be taken upon to deal with this debilitating problem.
<p>
Dealing successfully with this phenomenon requires a deeper understanding of its underlying
causes. The various authors who have attempted to give a plausible explanation for the
problem have often singled out one dimension or another as being the most crucial factor.
One maintains, however, that the matter is not that simple and that political, cultural and
economic factors all lie at the root of this multidimensional problem.
<p>
Over time, the state in Africa has evolved as an undemocratic, autocratic and patrimonial
entity. Being essentially a vehicle to execute the unquestioned will and whims of an
unaccountable ruling elite, it became an ideal breeding ground for the very forces making for
unethical behaviour. Even with the transition to greater political liberalisation, overt
paternalism is a quality which the state has yet to effectively rid itself of.
<p>
Because recruitment in the civil service has been and is still very much influenced by
patronage and political factors, the loyalties, commitment and actions of public officials are
often guided and shaped by their primordial loyalties rather than the requirements of impartial
professionalism.
<p>
The sprawling nature of the state, its over- extended control over economic matters and the
licensing and approval powers with which public officials are invested have created greater
opportunities for the abuse of office for self-enrichment.
<p>
The issue whether the economic crisis is the cause or effect of the ethical crisis in Africa is
still hotly debated. Nevertheless, one is of the opinion that while the two crises are no doubt
mutually reinforcing, the rapid deterioration of economic conditions experienced by most
African countries since the 1980s, has further encouraged public office holders, both
politicians and administrators, to seek and obtain rewards in exchange for their services and
weakened their aversion and moral abhorrence to such practices.
<p>
<h3>Can the Situation be Remedied?</h3>
<p>
Repeated attempts have been made over the years to combat corrupt practices and unethical
violations. A common feature of those is the enactment of codes and establishment of
institutional mechanisms to enforce ethical behaviour.
<p>
Nigeria enacted a Code of Conduct in 1975 - which was subsequently incorporated into the
1979 and 1989 constitutions - requiring public officials not to allow personal interests to
conflict with their official responsibilities; not to engage in secondary pecuniary engagements;
not to operate foreign bank accounts; not to ask for gifts; and to declare their assets
immediately after taking office, every four years and at the end of their terms of office. In
1957, Ethiopia enacted a Special Penal Code chapter two of which, under the title "Break of
Trust and Offences Against the Interest of the Government and Public," covered provisions
governing, inter-alia, the receipt of ill-gotten gains, misuse or waste of public property,
forgery of public documents, corrupt practices and acceptance of undue advantage. C&ocirc;te
d'Ivoire established an anti-corruption law and a "Clearance Certificate Against Corruption"
in 1977.
<p>
A variety of bodies have also been established to curb ethical violations. Ghana, Nigeria,
Namibia, Sudan, Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have experimented with ombudsmen.
Nigeria established a Public Complaints Committee in 1975 to investigate complaints against
public officials, and also a Public Accounts Committee in 1966 to assist the legislature in
overseeing the expenditure of public funds. Similar bodies were also established in other
countries, such as the Working People's Control Committee (1987) and the "Special Court"
to try offences related to exploitations, waste, abuse of authority, corrupt practice and
favouritism (1981) in Ethiopia; and the Anti-Corruption Squad (1975), Commission for
Enforcement of the Leadership Code (1973) and Permanent Commission of Enquiry (1966)
in Tanzania.
<p>
In some cases, these initiatives were partially successful in achieving some of the immediate
objectives behind these measures. However, this has not been generally the case. More crucial
has been the fact that the incidence of ethical violation has increased even in countries where
a large number of violators have been investigated and/or punished.
<p>
The salient questions remain: why have these measures been generally unsuccessful, and,
given the extent of the malaise of unethical conduct and the hitherto limited success in dealing
with it, is it realistic to expect that this situation can be remedied?
<p>
In the first instance, these measures have failed because they were introduced in an overall
political and policy environment that was not sufficiently conducive to enable the success of
the measures. When grand corruption is rampant at the top level of government and politics,
the nature of governance has basically remained undemocratic, unaccountable and patrimonial,
and where patronage systems have remained intact, one can hardly expect to enforce measures
against unethical behaviour with any degree of seriousness or that the enforcement systems
and institutions will be left to function without interference. Thus, the nature of the state and
governance and commitment at the highest political level are crucial prerequisites for any
successful drive to curb and punish ethical violations.
<p>
Second, the measures that have been introduced have been partial in nature, focussing mainly
on sanctions. 
<p>
Third, many of the institutions that were established to promote ethics and accountability often
lacked the resources, public visibility, impartiality and public support that are critical for their
success.
<p>
The enormity of the task to deal with corrupt practices and to promote ethics and
accountability in the African public service is not to be underestimated. In spite of  set-backs
experienced in this regard, it is still possible to score gains in a meaningful manner. Central
to this is the need for the dedicated and sustained implementation of comprehensive, broad-
based and self-reinforcing measures - and not merely partial solutions - by the government
and the public to deal with the multi- dimensional nature of the problem, within the
framework of democratic, responsive, transparent and accountable governance.
<p>
A comprehensive agenda to promote ethics and accountability in contemporary African public
services ought to comprise:
<ul>
<li>Fostering and promoting enabling conditions of service to enhance professional and ethical
standards.
<li>Advancing and affirming sound policies on recruitment, training and public personnel
management.
<li>Encouraging public service associations to play a catalytic role in institutionalising
professional values and defending occupational interest.
<li>Promoting a psychology of service in political and public life.
<li>Creating, strengthening and upholding the integrity and effectiveness of public institutions
of accountability.
<li>Cutting down on excessive centralisation and bureaucratisation.
<li>Enacting, improving and effectively enforcing legal instruments, codes of conduct and
regulations promoting ethics and accountability.
<li>Establishing coalitions of business associations and civil society  to expose and fight
corruption.
<li>Mass education campaigns on the extent and cost of corruption and unethical behaviour.
<li>The systematic and impartial prosecution of violators.
<li>Fostering popular participation to ensure the responsiveness, accountability and
transparency of governance.
</ul>
This last element of the comprehensive agenda deserves further mention.
Even the best of safeguards and practices under democratic systems of governance can give
way to abuses -- as the experience of developed countries has repeatedly demonstrated.
<p>
For this reason, a crucial safeguard of high standards of public ethics and accountability in
Africa has to fall on the ability of the citizens and people's organisations and associations to
hold public officials and politicians accountable for their acts and also to ensure that public
institutions fulfil their functions properly and responsibly. The ongoing process of political
reforms in Africa should enhance such opportunities.
<p>
Finally, the international dimension to the ethical crisis ought not to be neglected. Bribery of
public officials in developing countries has often been used by businessmen in developed
countries as a fair and legitimate methods for export promotion. Many governments in
industrialised countries ignore the bribery, some openly promote it and a few even make it
tax-deductible. There is an urgent need to enforce ethical behaviour at the international level
if grand corruption in developing countries - including Africa - as a result of international
business transactions is to be curtailed. In recent years, Transparency International has been
playing an appreciable role in raising the alarm about this problem and demanding that action
be taken to remedy it. Any meaningful progress in this direction would require agreement on
and the strict enforcement of international conventions punishing corruptors; strengthening
international integrity systems; establishing disclosure of external accounts laws; and
repatriation of wealth and payments amassed through international corruption. The
international community is, however, far from any consensus that is likely to institute such
measures.

<H3>D&#233;claration de la pr&#233;sidence de l&#146;UE sur la R&#233;publique centrafricaine</H3>

L&#146;UE est vivement pr&#233;occup&#233;e par le grave foyer d&#146;instabilit&#233; qui existe en Centrafrique. Elle souhaite que les parties en pr&#233;sence &#224; Bangui trouvent les voies d&#146;une solution pacifique.Dans cette perspective, l&#146;Union apporte tout son soutien &#224; la m&#233;diation initi&#233;e par les Pr&#233;sidents du Gabon, du Burkina Faso, du Tchad et du Mali et conduite sur place par le G&#233;n&#233;ral Amadou Toumani Tour&#233;. L&#146;UE appelle les parties en pr&#233;sence a ne pas compromettre le processus d&#233;mocratique initie il y a trois ans en Centrafrique, et a respecter pleinement les principes de l&#146;&#233;tat de droit et de la bonne gouvernance, qui sont essentiels pour le d&#233;veloppement du pays et de ses relations avec l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne.R&#233;f.: Bxl, 10 janvier 1997 - 5125/97 (Presse 2) - P 2/97

<H3>D&#233;claration de la pr&#233;sidence au nom de l&#146;UE sur la situation au Myanmar</H3>

L&#146;UE se d&#233;clare profond&#233;ment pr&#233;occup&#233;e par les informations faisant &#233;tat de la brutalit&#233; avec laquelle la police a dispers&#233; de r&#233;centes manifestations d&#146;&#233;tudiants au Myanmar. L&#146;UE affirme le droit &#224; la libert&#233; de r&#233;union pacifique et &#224; la libert&#233; d&#146;expression et demande &#224; toutes les parties de faire preuve de mod&#233;ration et d&#146;emp&#234;cher toute nouvelle d&#233;t&#233;rioraion de la situation.
<p>
L&#146;UE se d&#233;clare aussi vivement pr&#233;occup&#233;e par les restrictions qui ont &#233;t&#233; impos&#233;es aux d&#233;placements de Daw Aung San Suu Kyi et elle engage le Conseil pour le r&#233;tablissement de la loi et de l&#146;ordre (SLORC) &#224; retirer les barrages routiers des abords de son domicile et &#224; lui accorder une libert&#233; de circulation totale. L&#146;Union europ&#233;enne se d&#233;clare aussi vivement pr&#233;occup&#233;e par des informations persistantes concernant la possibilit&#233; de nouvelles atteintes imminentes &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; personnelle de DawAungSanSuuKyi. L&#146;UE tiendra le SLORC pour pleinement responsable pour le bien-&#234;tre physique de Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.

<H3>D&#233;l&#233;gation chilienne au CES</H3>

Le 14 janvier une d&#233;l&#233;gation du Chili a rencontr&#233; la pr&#233;sidence du Comit&#233; &#233;conomique et social (CES) pour un &#233;change de vues dans le contexte de l&#146;accord cadre de coop&#233;ration sign&#233; en juin 1996 entre l&#146;UE et le Chili.
<p>
Cette d&#233;l&#233;gation a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sid&#233;e par le ministre de l&#146;&#233;conomie, M. ALVARO GARCIA, accompagn&#233; de repr&#233;sentants du minist&#232;re de l&#146;&#233;conomie, du minist&#232;re des relations ext&#233;rieures, du parlement et de la Fondation Eurochile, ainsi que de chefs d&#146;entreprises.
La d&#233;l&#233;gation du Comit&#233; &#233;tait quant &#224; elle compos&#233;e du vice-pr&#233;sident du CES, M. G. REGALDO, de MM. V. CAL (rapporteur de l&#146;avis du CES sur les relations UE/Am&#233;rique latine), P. MARGALEF i MASIA (pr&#233;sident de la section de l&#146;agriculture), A. PEZZINI (vice presidente nazionale, Confartigianato), G. BERNABEI (responsabile coordinamento Attivit&#224; Internazionali della Confindustria) et Sergio E. SANTILLAN CABEZA (rapporteur de l&#146;avis du CES sur les relations UE/Mercosur).


<H3>La politique m&#233;diterran&#233;enne: un des piliers des relations ext&#233;rieures de l&#146;UE pour le CES</H3>

M. Tom Jenkins, pr&#233;sident du Comit&#233; &#233;conomique et social (CES), est intervenu au 2e sommet euro-m&#233;diterran&#233;en des Conseils &#233;conomiques et sociaux et institutions similaires, organis&#233; &#224; Paris ces 21 et 22 novembre.
<p>
Il a montr&#233; que le CES avait particip&#233; activement, au cours de ces dix derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, au processus de construction de nouvelles relations entre l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne et ses partenaires m&#233;diterran&#233;ens. Deux instruments ont principalement &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233;s, a-t-il expliqu&#233;: l&#146;activit&#233; consultative au service des autres institutions de l&#146;UE et la coop&#233;ration avec les milieux &#233;conomiques et sociaux des pays tiers m&#233;diterran&#233;ens.
<p>
Le Comit&#233; consid&#232;re la politique m&#233;diterran&#233;enne comme l&#146;un des piliers des relations ext&#233;rieures de l&#146;UE: d&#233;j&#224; en 1989, il soutenait que, pour affronter de tels d&#233;fis, une offensive diplomatique de grande envergure &#233;tait n&#233;cessaire, permettant d&#146;englober la &#147;grande Europe&#148;, le Bassin m&#233;diterran&#233;en et le Moyen-Orient dans un projet commun de s&#233;curit&#233;, de d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique, de croissance et de cohabitation pacifique: le &#147;Projet de cod&#233;velopement&#148;.
<p>
Le CES a ainsi contribu&#233; &#224; forger l&#146;id&#233;e de partenariat eurom&#233;diterran&#233;en, ayant soutenu l&#146;id&#233;e d&#146;une approche globale de la politique m&#233;diterran&#233;enne dans tous ses avis en la mati&#232;re.
<p>
Le CES avait par ailleurs demand&#233;, d&#232;s 1989, la constitution d&#146;une structure de contact permanent avec les Conseils &#233;conomiques et sociaux nationaux ou avec les organisations socioprofessionnelles des pays tiers m&#233;diterran&#233;ens.
Suite &#224; la D&#233;claration adopt&#233;e lors de la conf&#233;rence interminist&#233;rielle eurom&#233;diterran&#233;enne de Barcelone, dans laquelle le CES avait &#233;t&#233; invit&#233; &#224; prendre l&#146;initiative d&#146;&#233;tablir les liens avec ses homologues et organismes m&#233;diterran&#233;ens, le Comit&#233; a cr&#233;&#233; un groupe de travail charg&#233; de maintenir un contact permanent entre tous ces conseils, d&#146;organiser le Sommet annuel, de coordonner la pr&#233;paration des &#233;tudes th&#233;matiques et de veiller &#224; ce que soient &#233;labor&#233;s des rapports nationaux par tous les pays qui participents au Sommet. Le CES assurera l&#146;animation et la direction de ce groupe de travail, mais aussi la connexion avec les quinze Etats membres de l&#146;UE et la continuit&#233; des relations avec les Etats associ&#233;s de la M&#233;diterran&#233;e. Il assurera &#233;galement les relations avec les institutions communautaires telles que la Commission ou le Conseil de l&#146;UE.

<HR>
<P>
<B>En los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os se ha discutido intensamente
acerca de c&oacute;mo lograr una mayor estabilidad de los proyectos
de desarrollo. A menudo funcionan bien aquellos proyectos que
realizan un aporte reducido al desarrollo de su entorno, porque
ofrecen soluciones aisladas. Por otra parte, los proyectos con
efectos masivos, con el objetivo de inducir el desarrollo, terminan
a menudo en fracasos, debido a su complejidad. En este articulo
se examinan las condiciones que pueden asegurar tanto la estabilidad
como la masividad de los proyectos.</B>
<P>
EI objetivo general de la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo
(CD), de ayuda para la autoayuda, significa para las instituciones
de cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica (CT) tratar de mejorar la
capacidad de solucionar problemas en los pa&#237;ses partenaires. Desde
hace tiempo se discute acerca de cu&aacute;les son los conceptos
e instrumentos adecuados para ello. La necesidad de una reorientaci&oacute;n
de la CT qued&oacute; en evidencia particularmente en las discusiones
que se llevan a cabo desde fines de la d&eacute;cada de los 80
en el Comit&eacute; de Asistencia para el Desarrollo (CAD) de
la Organizaci&oacute;n para la Cooperaci&oacute;n y el Desarrollo
Econ&oacute;mico (OCDE).
<P>
Los principios desarrollados por la OCDE son:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Orientarse por el concepto de desarrollo duradero
<P>
<li>Orientarse m&aacute;s hacia los partenaires 
<P>
<li>Subsidiaridad
<P>
<li>Areas prioritarias: desarrollo institucional, fortalecimiento
de las capacidades de gerencia en los sectores p&uacute;blico
y privado, desarrollo de capital humano
<P>
<li>Poner m&aacute;s &eacute;nfasis en programas y estrategias en
lugar de apoyar proyectos aislados
<P>
<li>Poner &eacute;nfasis en un empleo de medios efectivos y eficiente
<P>
<li>Mejorar la coordinaci&oacute;n entre los dadores y las organizaciones
de ayuda.</ul>
<P>
Ese marco conceptual tambi&eacute;n fue asumido por la CT alemana,
que se esfuerza en tracer concordar los efectos masivos con la
perdurabilidad.
<P>
<B>El problema de la perdurabilidad</B>
<P>
El criterio de la perdurabilidad ha sido objeto de renovada atenci&oacute;n
en los &uacute;ltimos tiempos, tanto en lo que se refiere al desarrollo
en general como a nivel de proyectos concretos. De perdurables
pueden ser calificados los proyectos cuando contin&uacute;an existiendo
despu&eacute;s de su traspaso al partenaire y est&aacute;n en
condiciones de adaptarse a cambios de condiciones.
<P>
Numerosas evaluaciones han demostrado que los proyectos de la
CT tienen una posibilidad de alcanzar los objetivos propuestos
y perdurar siempre y cuando 
<P>
<ul>
<li>el marco de condiciones political, legales, econ&oacute;micas
y socioculturales sea favorable o el proyecto pueda influir sobre
esas condiciones
<P>
<li>el proyecto est&eacute; a cargo de una instituci&oacute;n motivada
y eficiente o que pueda ser fortalecida por el proyecto de tal
forma que se produzca una cooperaci&oacute;n y un traspaso paulatino
de las responsabilidades al partenaire
<P>
<li>el grupo destinatario sea integrado tanto en la planificaci&oacute;n
como en la ejecuci&oacute;n del proyecto
<P>
<li>los recursos a disposici&oacute;n del proyecto se encuentren
en una relaci&oacute;n realista con los objetivos
<P>
<li>se halla fijado un plazo realista (es decir, no muy corto) para
la realizaci&oacute;n del proyecto
<P>
<li>el personal de proyecto, tanto alem&aacute;n como local, est&eacute;
suficientemene capacitado pare realizar las tareas propuestas.</ul>
<P>
La discusi&oacute;n dej&oacute; sobre todo en evidencia que efectos
del proyecto perdurables
s&oacute;lo pueden ser alcanzados con una planificaci&oacute;n
y una ejecuci&oacute;n efectivas. Con 
otras palabras: la perdurabilidad no puede asegurarse con medidas
en la fase final del proyecto o despu&eacute;s de su conclusi&oacute;n
(asesoramiento posterior, envio de expertos de corto plazo).
<P>
<B>El descuidado criterio de significancia</B>
<P>
Desde el punto de vista del desarrollo, no es suficiente que un
proyecto sea realizado efectivamente y muestre tener efectos duraderos.
La cuesti&oacute;n no es si un proyecto realiza un aporte cualquiera
a la soluci&oacute;n de un problema cualquiera.
<P>
Lo que interesa es si un proyecto (o un conjunto de proyectos)
realiza un aporte significativo a la soluci&oacute;n de un
problema definido como particularmente importante en el contexto
de una estrategia de desarrollo. Es decir que debe plantearse
la cuesti&oacute;n de la significancia, o sea determinar en qu&eacute;
medida los &eacute;xitos de un proyecto pueden ser transformados
en impulsos y logros de desarrollo . Esos objetivos se alcanzan
cuando un proyecto:
<P>
<ul>
<li>tiene efectos amplios, sectoriales o regionales 
<P>
<li>realiza aportes estructurales, es decir 
<P>
<li>que apoya reformas estructurales o ayuda a crear una red de relaciones
entre instituciones o entre el Estado y actores no estatales
<P>
<li>tiene car&aacute;cter modelo, es decir que es repetible en otros
sectores o en otras regiones.</ul>
<P>
<B>Exigencias que se plantean a proyectos significativos</B>
<P>
Los proyectos destinados a desplegar
efectos significativos plantean enormes exigencies al proceso
de definici&oacute;n, planificaci&oacute;n y ejecuci&oacute;n.
<P>
<ol>
<li>Si en pa&#237;ses con escaso nivel de desarrollo no existe un marco
de condiciones favorables, los proyectos deben ayudar a crearlas.
<P>
<li>En proyectos con efectos masivos sectoriales o regionales o
con car&aacute;cter modelo debe ser creada a menudo una estructura
institucional adecuada.
<P>
<li>No es suficiente optimizar la estructura interna de proyecto.
Es necesario insertarlo adecuadamente en el entorno
sectorial o regional.
<P>
<li>Los proyectos significantes exigen una
intense cooperaci&oacute;n entre los pa&#237;ses dadores y los paises
receptores y una mejor coordinaci&oacute;n entre los dadores.
<P>
<li>Las exigencias a la planificaci&oacute;n y administraci&oacute;n
crecen con la complejidad de un proyecto.</ol>
<P>
<B>&#191;Perdurabilidad vs. significancia?</B>
<P>
En el m&aacute;s extremo de los casos es posible lograr efectos
perdurables de proyecto (por ej. creaci&oacute;n de un laboratorio
en una universidad), sin que se realice un aporte significativo
a la soluci&oacute;n del problema realmente relevante (por ej.
cubrir las necesidades de investigaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s urgentes
del grupo destinatario m&aacute;s importante, desarrollo de un
interacci&oacute;n entre la investigaci&oacute;n y la pr&aacute;ctica). 
<P>
&quot;Proyectos-islas&quot;, no integrados en el entorno social,
pueden ser muy exitosos. En las evaluaciones de proyectos agrarios
se llega incluso a la conclusi&oacute;n de que los proyectos con
mayor perdurabilidad fueron proyectos exclusivamente monocausales:
cuanto m&aacute;s modestos, m&aacute;s eficaces. Pero, &#191;tienen
relevancia?
<P>
Adem&aacute;s se puede constatar tendencialmente que (en particular
con un entorno tubulento y poco eficaz) la perdurabilidad puede
alcanzarse m&aacute;s f&aacute;cilmente en proyectos con efectos
marginales que en proyectos con objetivos significativos (es
decir, que aspiran a modificar el entorno).
<P>
A partir de esas reflexiones pueden extraerse las siguientes conclusiones:
<P>
La perdurabilidad y la significancia se hallan en una relaci&oacute;n
de proporcionalidad inversa. La perdurabilidad es una condici&oacute;n
pare la signficancia de proyectos: un proyecto que fracasa no
puede ser significante. Por otro lado, la perdurabilidad es m&aacute;s
f&aacute;cil de alcanzar en proyectos poco complejos que en aqu&eacute;llos
que aspiran a modificar su entorno.
<P>
Si se define la perdurabilidad como el criterio de &eacute;xito
m&aacute;s importante en la CT, una de las consecuencias podria ser renunciar tendencialmente a proyectos muy ambiciosos
y por lo tanto, riesgosos. Pero el resultado seria que los proyectos
perdurables s&oacute;lo realizarian aportes marginales a la soluci&oacute;n
de los problemas sociales y econ&oacute;micos del subdesarrollo.
Desde el punto de vista del desarrollo no tiene sendo por lo tanto
renunciar a proyectos ambiciosos.
<P>
La otra consecuencia es concluir que los criterios de significancia
y perdurabilidad
se refieren a diferentes dimensiones de los efectos de proyectos
de desarrollo. Por lo tanto, ambos criterios deberian ser considerados
explicitamente y por separado en el ciclo de proyecto.
<P>
<B>Cortando el nudo gordiano</B>
<P>
En vista de la importancia de ambos criterios  perdurabilidad
y significancia  para la pr&aacute;ctica de la cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo, no queda otra opci&oacute;n que haliar una
relaci&oacute;n adecuada entre ambos. Ello presupone poder limitar
y controlar los mayores riesgos inherentes a los proyectos m&aacute;s
complejos.
<P>
Ello exige por un lado que deben observarse detenidamente los
criterios considerados troy esenciales para una eficiente planificaci&oacute;n
de proyectos (v&eacute;ase arriba). Por otro lado, deberian realizarse
fases de orientaci&oacute;n y sentarse prioridades particularmente
en aquellas &aacute;reas en las que la parte alemana tiene
m&aacute;s que aportar.
<P>
Cumplidas las condiciones mencionadas, la contradicci&oacute;n
entre la significancia y la perdurabilidad parece ser controlable. Y ya es tiempo de transformer la significancia en un criterio
central para la selecci&oacute;n de proyectos, tan importante
como la efectividad, la eficiencia y la perdurabilidad. Ello implica:
<P>
<ol>
<I><B><li>Orientaci&oacute;n hacia la significancia a nivel de proyecto</B></I><br>
<P>
Desde el punto de vista de un pa&#237;s en desarrollo no es deseable
tener muchos
proyectos, cada uno exitoso en si mismo. Lo importante es transformar
&eacute;xitos aislados de proyecto en &eacute;xitos  &quot;sist&eacute;micos&quot;
de desarrollo. En el foco de atenci&oacute;n debe ester la cuesti&oacute;n
de qu&eacute; aporte puede realizar un proyecto al desarrollo
de estructuras en un sector importante.
<P>
<B><I><li>Fomento de sistema</I></B><br>
<P>
Imaginable seria un fomento sist&eacute;mico, con instrumentos
coordinados a diferentes niveles. El objetivo deberia ser una
conexi&oacute;n horizontal entre proyectos al mismo nivel y una
conexi&oacute;n vertical de proyectos en diferentes niveles, por
ej. de proyectos de fomentos de desarrollo institucional con medidas
de asesoramiento al nivel de sistema. El objetivo de realizar
proyectos significantes e integrados en su entorno, que coayuden
al desarrollo de estructuras, lleva a la cuesti&oacute;n de c&oacute;mo
poder influir sobre otras instituciones del entorno o incluso
fortalecer estructuras de instituciones ejecutoras de proyectos
m&aacute;s all&aacute; del fomento cl&aacute;sico de las
organizaciones ejecutoras. Esos intentos de fortalecer la autoorganizaci&oacute;n
social son ambiciosos y tendr&aacute;n &eacute;xito cuando:
<P>
<ul>
<li>existan un c&aacute;lculo realista de costos y sean combinadas
la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica y la financiera
<P>
<li>haya sido previsto tiempo suficiente para la realizaci&oacute;n
del proyecto
<P>
<li>sea transfieran conocimientos desde Alemania en forma continuada,
por ej. a trav&eacute;s del fomento del hermanamiento de ciudades,
programas de becas y acuerdos entre instituciones relevantes (c&aacute;maras,
asociaciones, institutos educativos y de desarrollo t&eacute;cnico.)</ul>
<P>
Cuando esos proyectos logran sus objetivos, pueden realizar un
importante aporte para aumentar la capacidad de resoluci&oacute;n
de problemas en un sector o en una regi&oacute;n. Menos exitosos
son proyectos que hacen las veces de moderadores o intermediadores,
sin que existan antes suficientes actores cualificados. Para los
proyectos de ese tipo es imprescindible la existencia de un marco
de condiciones generales estable en el sector correspondiente
y de actores que puedan actuar estrat&eacute;gicamente.
<P>
Ahora se prefiere la cooperaci&oacute;n con organizaciones no
gubernamentales. Con la esperanza de poder substituir al Estado
d&eacute;bil con actores sociales, se pasa por alto que un desarrollo
sostenido s&oacute;lo es posible con el concurso de ambos y de
un marco de condiciones generales estable.
<P>
<B><I><li>Areas prioritarias por sector</I></B><br>
<P>
Estas reflexiones sugieren una nueva definici&oacute;n de &aacute;reas
prioritarias por parte de la CT alemana. En lugar de una diversificaci&oacute;n
de actividades en varios sectores es necesaria la concentraci&oacute;n
de la cooperaci&oacute;n en dos o tres &aacute;reas. Una estrategia
de ese tipo:
<P>
<ul>
<li>permite la acumulaci&oacute;n de conocimientos en la parse
alemana, lo que facilita llevar medidas hacia el entorno,
<P>
<li>posibilita la complementaci&oacute;n y combinaci&oacute;n
de diversos instrumentos, creando asi efectos sinerg&eacute;ticos,
<P>
<li>a trav&eacute;s de la cooperaci&oacute;n continuada con
los actores nacionales ayuda a fortalecer su capacidad de operar
estrat&eacute;gicamente,
<P>
<li>posibilita la elaboraci&oacute;n de m&oacute;dulos de proyectos,
que pueden repetirse en otros pa&#237;ses,
<P>
<li>facilita la coordinaci&oacute;n entre los dadores aumenta
la transparencia en los receptores.</ul>
<P>
<B><I><li>Desarrollo de un perfil especifico alem&aacute;n</I></B>
<P>
La necesaria definici&oacute;n de prioridades deberia realizarse
principalmente en &aacute;reas en las que la parte alemana tenga
ventajas en relaci&oacute;n con otros dadores. Entre &eacute;stas
se cuentan sectores en los que han sido creadas estructuras ejemplares
en Alemania, con politicas, instituciones, instrumentos y un capital
humano altamente eficientes. Entre esas &aacute;reas se hallan
por ej. la capacitaci&oacute;n dual (te&oacute;rica y en la empresa),
el sector de medici&oacute;n, normalizaci&oacute;n, inspecci&oacute;n
y aseguramiento de calidad, la tecnologia y politica ambientales,
la investigaci&oacute;n y el desarrollo industriales, asi como
formas de cooperaci&oacute;n entre el Estado, el sector privado
y los grupos sociales <I>(public-private partnership) </I>en la
politica econ&oacute;mica.
<P>
Las soluciones aqui esbozadas no pueden ser aplicadas mec&aacute;nicamente
a cualquier realidad, sino que deben ser adaptadas a las realidades
en cada pais y desarrolladas.
<P>
El desarrollo de un perfil alem&aacute;n de oferta en la cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo tendria adem&aacute;s otras ventajas:
<P>
La variedad de intereses de los muchos actores en Alemania y en
los pa&#237;ses partenaires no se seguirian manifestando en un gran
n&uacute;mero de solicitudes y proyectos diferentes. Por el contrario,
seria posible transmitir conocimientos t&eacute;cnicos especificos
intencionadamente en algunos pocos sectores y en el marco de programas.
<P>
Para los pa&#237;ses partenaires seria m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil presenter
solicitudes de apoyo claramente definidas. Las instituciones competentes
se ven a menudo desbordadas a la hora de estimar las posibilidades
de los respectivos dadores.</ol>
<P>
<B>S&#237;ntesis y perspectivas</B>
<P>
La intense discusi&oacute;n de los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os
en torno a la sostenibilidad ha dejado claras conclusiones en
cuanto a cu&aacute;les son
las condiciones de &eacute;xito y los factores de riesgo en la
cooperaci&oacute;n pare el desarrollo a nivel de proyecto. Es
necesario que en el futuro se discuta de la misma manera el criterio
de la significancia. Sobre todo se deberia reflexionar acerca
de las posibilidades de realizar aportes al desarrollo de estrategias
y political sostenibles a nivel sectorial, regional o nacional,
a trav&eacute;s de una CT program&aacute;tica y estrat&eacute;gica.
<P>
Ya existen impulsos en ese sentido. Entre ellos se cuentan los
conceptos sectoriales del Ministerio de Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica,
por ej. en la capacitaci&oacute;n profesional, con el fomento
de la peque&ntilde;a y mediana industria, y en un creciente n&uacute;mero
de conceptos por pa&#237;s, en los que se resaltan la fijaci&oacute;n
de prioridades sectoriales y una politica program&aacute;tica
global.
<P>
La definici&oacute;n de prioridades y la consideraci&oacute;n
de la significancia facilitan adem&aacute;s
<P>
<ul>
<li>una reflexi&oacute;n m&aacute;s sistem&aacute;tica sobre
los conceptos del desarrollo que en el caso de la cooperaci&oacute;n
meramente a nivel de proyecto
<P>
<li>una fructifera competencia entre diferentes conceptos y
una b&uacute;squeda sistem&aacute;tica de soluciones adecuadas
pare cada pa&#237;s
<P>
<li>las iniciativas para una mejor coordinaci&oacute;n de la
cooperaci&oacute;n internacional, considerando los fuertes de
cada uno de los dadores y organizaciones de ayuda.</ul>
<P>
En lugar de politicas paralelas no coordinadas de diversos dadores
en el mismo sector de un pa&#237;s receptor y del consecuente alto
grado de arbitrariedad y desorden a nivel de proyectos podria
intentarse asi conservar el pluralismo institucional, pero canalizado
en un cauce ordenado.

<p>
<H3>UE/Am&#233;rique centrale: approfondir le dialogue de San Jos&#233;</H3>
(Rapport CARNERO GONZALEZ - doc. A4-418/9)
<p>
Tel est l&#146;objectif prioritaire du rapport de M.Carnero GONZALEZ adopt&#233; par le Parlement europ&#233;en. Aujourd&#146;hui, il s&#146;agit de mettre en oeuvre la d&#233;claration de Florence du 21 mars 1996 qui fixe de nouveaux objectifs &#224; la coop&#233;ration UE/Am&#233;rique centrale.
<p>
Bien que des progr&#232;s aient &#233;t&#233; r&#233;alis&#233;s gr&#226;ce notamment &#224; l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne (instauration de la paix dans la r&#233;gion, poursuite du processus d&#146;int&#233;gration r&#233;gionale, soutien aux processus d&#233;mocratiques et au respect des droits de l&#146;homme), il faut &#233;carter les nouvelles menaces et en particulier celles qui r&#233;sultent du ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de pauvret&#233; qui prend &#147;des proportions intol&#233;rables&#148;. Par cons&#233;quent, l&#146;Union doit s&#146;efforcer d&#146;&#233;largir le champ d&#146;action de la coop&#233;ration, notamment via un renforcement de la coop&#233;ration r&#233;gionale, pour r&#233;pondre aux nouvelles aspirations de ces pays et &#147;&#224; des relations &#233;quilibr&#233;es et coh&#233;rentes entre l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne et l&#146;Am&#233;rique centrale, en &#233;vitant de pratiquer un double langage&#148;.
<p>
D&#146;autres propositions sont avanc&#233;es: int&#233;grer une dimension sociale dans la coop&#233;ration, privil&#233;gier les groupes les 
plus vuln&#233;rables de la soci&#233;t&#233; et s&#146;efforcer d&#146;int&#233;grer la soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans cette coop&#233;ration. Il faut aussi intensifier la participation des groupes locaux &#224; la gestion des programmes et mieux r&#233;partir le budget entre les diff&#233;rentes zones g&#233;ographiques.
Quant &#224; la dotation budg&#233;taire, elle doit &#234;tre augment&#233;e et l&#146;accord-cadre de coop&#233;ration doit s&#146;accompagner d&#146;un 
protocole financier, tant pour cet accord que pour les accords futurs de m&#234;me nature. Cet effort doit s&#146;accompagner d&#146;un autre, celui &#147;de la remise au moins partielle de la dette ext&#233;rieure&#148;. 
<p>
Autre piste &#224; explorer, l&#146;extension &#224; l&#146;Am&#233;rique centrale du nouveau r&#233;gime de pr&#233;f&#233;rences g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;es pour les produits industriels dont b&#233;n&#233;ficient d&#233;j&#224; les pays du Pacte andin.
<p>
Bien entendu, l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne doit poursuivre son soutien &#224; la d&#233;mocratisation, &#224; la protection les droits de l&#146;homme ainsi qu&#146;&#224; la consolidation de l&#146;Etat de droit. Pour cela, il convient d&#146;&#233;tablir un programme d&#146;action globale de la PESC pour l&#146;Am&#233;rique centrale.
L&#146;un des objectifs de celui-ci est de lutter contre le ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de l&#146;impunit&#233; et passe par la cr&#233;ation d&#146;un Tribunal p&#233;nal international (TPI). &#147;Ce ph&#233;nom&#232;ne odieux&#148; doit &#234;tre combattu de fa&#231;on d&#233;termin&#233;e car il constitue &#147;une grave violation de la cause des droits de l&#146;homme&#148;. D&#146;o&#249; la demande adress&#233;e &#224; la Commission europ&#233;enne d&#146;&#233;laborer &#147;une Convention internationale contre l&#146;impunit&#233;&#148;.

<H3>Partenariat 1996-2000  UE/Am&#233;rique latine: la CE manque d&#146;ambition</H3>
(Rapport BERTENS - doc. A4-416/96)
<p>
En adoptant le rapport de M. Jan-Willem BERTENS, le Parlement europ&#233;en soutient la communication de la Commission europ&#233;enne sur le renforcement du partenariat entre l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne et l&#146;Am&#233;rique latine. Mais il estime les propositions de la Commission &#147;vagues et peu novatrices&#148;; elles manquent de &#147;perspectives globales&#148; et ne rel&#232;vent pas d&#146;une PESC efficace.
<p>
Et le Parlement de plaider pour un nouveau &#147;dialogue transatlantique&#148; d&#146;envergure en demandant au Conseil et &#224; la Commission europ&#233;enne d&#146;&#233;tablir un programme d&#146;action globale pr&#233;cis et dot&#233; de cr&#233;dits budg&#233;taires suffisants. Paix, d&#233;mocratie et respect des droits de l&#146;homme en Am&#233;rique latine demeurent les vecteurs de toute action de l&#146;Union dans cette zone g&#233;ographique.
Mais il faut aller plus loin et impliquer la &#147;soci&#233;t&#233; civile&#148; en la faisant participer &#224; la mise en oeuvre de cette 
coop&#233;ration par la cr&#233;ation de fora consultatifs. Autant d&#146;&#233;l&#233;ments qui contribueront &#224; combattre la pauvret&#233;
et &#147;les in&#233;galit&#233;s sociales&#148; qui &#147;risquent de provoquer de fortes  explosions sociales&#148;.
Il faut que les futurs accords s&#146;accompagnent de protocoles financiers comportant une augmentation plus substantielle des ressources et impliquant une ouverture n&#233;goci&#233;e et r&#233;ciproque des march&#233;s, sans distinction. 
<p>Enfin, si l&#146;on veut r&#233;ellement contribuer au &#147;d&#233;colage&#148; de ces pays, il faut &#147;les exon&#233;rer d&#146;une partie de la dette externe&#148;.

<H3>OMC Bananes</H3>

(Rapport SANTINI - doc. A4-337/96)<p>
Le Parlement europ&#233;en a d&#233;cid&#233; de renvoyer &#224; sa commission de l&#146;agriculture le rapport de M.SANTINI sur l&#146;organisation commune des march&#233;s dans le secteur de la banane suite au refus de la Commission d&#146;accepter de r&#233;duire le contingent tarifaire de bananes import&#233;es des pays tiers de 2.553.000 tonnes &#224; 2.300.000 tonnes.

<H3>Droits de l&#146;homme</H3>

(Rapport LALUMIERE - doc. A4-400/96)
<p>
Le Parlement europ&#233;en a adopt&#233; le rapport de Mme Catherine LALUMIERE (ARE, F), sur la situation des droits de l&#146;homme dans le monde en 1995/96.
<p>
Le Parlement constate, malgr&#233; les efforts de l&#146;Union, &#147;une recrudescence des violences les plus barbares&#148; et une 
&#147;r&#233;surgence des conflits r&#233;gionaux d&#146;origine ethnique&#148; (Ex-Yougoslavie, Tch&#233;tch&#233;nie, Rwanda, Burundi, Za&#239;re, 
peuple kurde etc...). Certes, l&#146;Union tente d&#146;am&#233;liorer la protection internationale et europ&#233;enne de ces droits mais 
elle a du mal &#224; sortir de ses ambigu&#239;t&#233;s.
<p>
Outre la &#147;faiblesse de la PESC&#148;, le Parlement d&#233;nonce la &#147;difficult&#233; d&#146;int&#233;grer une composante morale dans les relations internationales&#148;. Par cons&#233;quent, l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne doit de toute urgence &#233;tablir une doctrine des droits de l&#146;Homme et se donner les moyens de la mettre en oeuvre.
<p>
Il estime que l&#146;Union doit favoriser une coop&#233;ration internationale efficace en vue de concr&#233;tiser le droit au d&#233;veloppement et d&#146;&#233;liminer ce qui y fait obstacle (amendement GUE/NGL).
(NDLR: Par d&#233;veloppement, on entend le processus global, &#233;conomique, social, culturel et politique qui tend &#224; l&#146;am&#233;lioration constante du bien-&#234;tre de la totalit&#233; de la population et de toutes les personnes sur la base de leur 
participation active, libre et significative au d&#233;veloppement et &#224; la juste r&#233;partition des avantages qui en d&#233;coulent). 
<p>
Il demande &#233;galement que l&#146;Union d&#233;finisse des clauses sociales minimales (travail des enfants, travail forc&#233; ou effectu&#233; dans des conditions d&#233;gradantes) conditionnant la l&#233;galit&#233; des transactions commerciales dans le cadre de l&#146;OMC.
<p>
Tout accord UE/Pays tiers &#147;doit &#234;tre syst&#233;matiquement justifi&#233; par l&#146;existence d&#146;une situation en mati&#232;re des droits de l&#146;Homme conforme aux exigences de l&#146;Union&#148;. Il est indispensable d&#146;adopter &#147;une proc&#233;dure permettant des mesures contraignantes en cas de violation&#148;. Pour agir efficacement, il faut suivre attentivement &#147;chaque situation locale pr&#233;cise&#148;. 
<p>
Mais il faut aller plus loin: l&#146;Union doit se doter des &#147;moyens n&#233;cessaires&#148; pour intervenir dans des missions humanitaires et de maintien de la paix.
<p>
A noter que le Parlement salue les efforts de l&#146;Assembl&#233;e paritaire ACP-UE visant &#224; promouvoir le respect des droits de l&#146;homme et de la d&#233;mocratie dans les pays ACP. Dans ce contexte, il soutient la d&#233;cision de son bureau de 
reporter la r&#233;union de la session pl&#233;ni&#232;re au Togo en raison de probl&#232;mes li&#233;s aux droits de l&#146;homme et &#224; la d&#233;mocratie dans ce pays. Il demande &#224; l&#146;Assembl&#233;e paritaire, sur la base de ce pr&#233;c&#233;dent, de ne pas pr&#233;voir de session pl&#233;ni&#232;re dans les pays o&#249; la coop&#233;ration est suspendue (amendement PPE).
<p>
Dans cette optique, la PESC doit pr&#233;ciser le droit d&#146;ing&#233;rence, les formes de ces interventions et l&#146;ensemble des 
instruments dont elle entend se doter. S&#146;il devait y avoir une &#147;intervention militaire&#148;, celle-ci ne se con&#231;oit que dans le cadre d&#146;un &#147;mandat des Nations unies et sous le contr&#244;le de leurs organes comp&#233;tents&#148;, ceci afin d&#146;&#233;viter toute interpr&#233;tation colonialiste ou imp&#233;raliste (100/95/3).
<p>
Autre proposition pour ne pas d&#233;truire la &#147;cr&#233;dibilit&#233; des droits de l&#146;Homme et celle de l&#146;Union&#148;, agir dans d&#146;autres 
domaines comme le soutien &#224; la d&#233;mocratisation et la reconstruction. Cette d&#233;marche suppose, entre autres 
priorit&#233;s: le soutien politique inconditionnel (y compris financier) aux tribunaux p&#233;naux internationaux actuels avec comme objectif leur transformation en Tribunal P&#233;nal International permanent; le lancement de programmes r&#233;conciliation de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile, de r&#233;habilitation des victimes de tortures, de viols et de chocs psychologiques; une protection sp&#233;ciale pour les groupes d&#233;favoris&#233;s.
<p>
La coh&#233;rence de l&#146;action de l&#146;Union en la mati&#232;re passe &#233;galement par une meilleure coordination Parlement europ&#233;en/Conseil/Commission. Il devrait y avoir un Commissaire responsable des droits de l&#146;homme. Par ailleurs, la Commission est invit&#233;e &#224; renforcer ses services sp&#233;cialis&#233;s et &#224; s&#146;assurer qu&#146;ils travaillent avec ceux du Parlement europ&#233;en. A l&#146;heure actuelle, il n&#146;y a pas de clart&#233; financi&#232;re, car les cr&#233;dits sont &#233;clat&#233;s entre les diff&#233;rentes actions. Cette lacune pourrait &#234;tre combl&#233;e par la pr&#233;sentation au Parlement europ&#233;en d&#146;un document de la Commission europ&#233;enne qui regroupe l&#146;ensemble des cr&#233;dits affect&#233;s aux droits de l&#146;homme.
<p>
En cons&#233;quence, le Parlement demande &#224; la CIG de concr&#233;tiser dans le futur trait&#233; &#147;la comp&#233;tence juridique dont l&#146;Union a besoin en mati&#232;re de droits de l&#146;Homme&#148;. Cette comp&#233;tence est indispensable pour l&#146;adh&#233;sion directe de l&#146;Union aux instruments juridiques internationaux tels que la Convention Europ&#233;enne des Droits de l&#146;Homme du Conseil de l&#146;Europe.

(Rapport KOUCHNER- doc. A4-8/97)
<p>
Le Parlement europ&#233;en, en adoptant le rapport de M.Bernard KOUCHNER, a donn&#233; son avis conforme &#224; l&#146;adh&#233;sion de l&#146;Autriche, de la Finlande et de la Su&#232;de &#224; la 4e Convention de Lom&#233;.

<H3>Role of NGOs in EU-decentralised co-operation: from a seminar to a newsletter<br>The seminar on decentralised co-operation, 6-7 December 1996</H3>
by <I>Debjani Das</I>
<p></CENTER><HR>
<I>More than sixty participants from 54 NGOs in 17 countries came together for two days (6-7th December 1996), to 
discuss among themselves and with members of the decentralised co-operation unit of the European Commission, the role of 
EU-NGOs in strengthening Southern partners in EU-decentralised co-operation. The following is an initial summary of 
its main conclusions, drawing from reports made during the seminar. A fuller report of the Seminar and related 
documentation can be made available upon request.</I>
<P>
<H4>Why the European Commission co-operates with NGOs</H4>
<P>
Does decentralised co-operation mean the same thing to its various 
proponents?
<P>
What should it achieve?
<P>
What are the central issues and dilemmas arising from present practice 
and recent tendencies?
<P>
In the introductory plenary session, dedicated to achieving theoretical 
clarity on the concept of EU- decentralised co-operation, Mr. 
Bernard Ryeland (head of the decentralised co-operation unit, DG VIII of the 
European Commission), recalled the reasons for the EC to sign a contract 
with the Liaison Committee on decentralised co-operation : to mobilise 
NGOs to identify possibilities of support for partners in developing countries, 
to identify political conditions and practical possibilities of intervention 
for NGOs and disseminate concrete procedures on the basis of on-going 
experiences.
<P>
Mr. Ryelandt described some typical cases of decentralised 
co-operation, and mentioned sources of financing, but emphasised that decentralised 
co-operation was not to be seen as a financial tool, but as a &quot;new 
developmental approach&quot; whose key element was grassroots democracy through 
a political and operational dialogue by decentralised agents with 
governments.
<p>
<H4>Issues raised by Southern NGOs</H4>
<P>
Panellists from southern NGOs (George Huggins, Nancy 
Kachingwe, F. Stephen), welcomed this new orientation in EU-co-operation 
towards democracy, and civil society participation in policy dialogue, but 
highlighted critical issues and dilemmas in implementation.
<P>
The changing State-NGO relations (from early &quot;hostility&quot; through a 
&quot;honeymoon&quot; to a more mature basis of critical co-operation) are a measure 
of the changing character of Southern NGOs towards more 
professionalism in service provision, with better 
organised community organisations - oft a product of earlier NGO efforts- 
taking over their earlier activist role.
<P>
Huggins resumed on the Caribbean context: &quot;genuine success&quot; in 
decentralised co-operation will depend on &quot;three inter-related actions&quot;: the 
service-delivery capacity of NGOs, State willingness to provide genuine 
space for NGO participation and EU ability to disseminate information on 
opportunities and resources and co-operate at a local level with NGOs and 
Governments.
<P>
How should bureaucrats be retrained into alternative management 
systems congruent with participatory value premises?
<P>
How should new interfaces(1 - The Commission uses the term &quot;interface&quot; for the co-ordinated structures or platforms within which the range of 
decentralised actors are represented. The existence of such an 
interface is a key condition for setting up a decentralised 
co-operation system -- see the LC Handbook on decentralised co-operation, 
page 28) be involved between civil society 
actors, State and international aid to ensure &quot;participatory&quot; and &quot;sustainable&quot; development? 
<P>
At which level should these interfaces be located and DC actors 
representative of civil society, across different levels, in contexts of conflicting 
agendas and unequal balances of power be identified and involved?
<P> &quot;How should identities be respected and power be shared without 
attempting to convert by allurement or intimidation or co-opt or steal?&quot; 
(P. Stephen)
<P>
Such questions raised at the beginning of the seminar underlined the 
complexities of translating a laudable theory into practice. Participants 
made a strong case for locating these issues in the international political context 
of &quot;globalised exclusion in the North and the South&quot; (P. Tilus), and structural adjustment-related weakening of Southern Governments, as well as 
within their local and regional specificities.
<P>
The seminar was a first step towards evolving coherent responses to 
these challenges.
<P>
<H4>Workshops: &quot;Models&quot; of EU-decentralised 
co-operation under the Lom&eacute; Convention</H4>
<P>
Through workshops on case studies centred on Zimbabwe, 
Senegal, Haiti and other country experiences, facilitated by inputs from 
resource persons from Southern as well as 
EU-NGOs, participants informed themselves on the state of the 
debate on decentralised co-operation in specific contexts and gained 
an understanding on the main issues facing NGOs, practical 
mechanisms in the preparation and setting up of a decentralised 
co-operation system, choices made, and the role of the &quot;interface&quot;.
<P>
The workshops provided a practical information basis on the functioning 
of decentralised co-operation in specific contexts, thus enabling an 
informed discussion on the potentials and constraints of decentralised 
co-operation as the EU-approach to participatory local development. They laid the 
basis for the plenary discussions on the following day on issues facing 
Southern NGOs, and consequences for EU-NGOs in general, and the 
Liaison Committee project on decentralised co-operation in particular.
<P>
<H4>Role of EU NGOs</H4>
<p>
The areas outlined below were identified in which the role of EU-NGOs 
in general and the Liaison Committee project in particular was discussed:
<P>
Sharing of knowledge, understanding and practices of 
decentralised co-operation from an &quot;NGO perspective&quot;, lobbying and 
advocacy, to facilitate dialogue. The specific value-added by EU-NGOs in 
general and the Liaison Committee project on decentralised 
co-operation in particular, lay in providing alternative information to 
official sources, and in communicating outcomes of discussion between the 
Liaison Committee and the European Commission to Southern decentralised 
co-operation actors; Capacity Building of Commission Staff, EU-NGOs, Southern 
Governments and Southern NGOs: While gender and 
centralisation-awareness training of official actors 
was considered crucial to the success of decentralised co-operation, 
this should arguably be undertaken by the Commission rather than the 
Liaison Committee. Capacity building in the South on the other hand 
should, where possible, be entrusted to local support organisations. 
EU-NGOs could play a liaison role in bringing Southern NGOs together to 
approach the EC for ensuring representativeness of the DC-interface and its 
accountability to civil society;
<P>
Evolving monitoring and evaluation systems and developing 
indicators for decentralised co-operation: here an emphasis was laid on 
linking NGO experiences in &quot;participatory development&quot;, &quot;institution 
building&quot;, &quot;NGO-State co-operation&quot; and 
&quot;partnership&quot; to EU-decentralised 
co-operation;
<P>
Notwithstanding the Liaison Committee's primary responsibility to 
the NGO-constituency, the need was stressed for a broad-based 
approach building bridges to other organised civil society actors.
<P>
In the midst of a plethora of suggestions concerning the role of 
EU-NGOs in strengthening their southern partners in decentralised 
co-operation, there was also awareness of the threat posed by the 
decentralised co-operation concept to EU-NGOs accustomed to 
working on a bilateral basis with Southern partners. Put on the defensive, 
EU-NGOs could take refuge in abstractions which did not touch their 
day-to-day work. This reinforced the need for clarity and credibility in 
the conceptualisation and implementation of decentralised co-operation. 
<P>
<H4>A mechanism for sharing information, and encouraging dialogue : The Newsletter on decentralised co-operation</H4>
<P>
Some of the needs articulated, such as the organisation of a 
seminar in the South on decentralised 
co-operation, the setting up of resource centres 
on decentralised co-operation, and capacity building of institutional actors 
cannot realistically be undertaken by the present Liaison Committee project 
on decentralised co-operation. During the next year, the project can however 
organise resource inputs from EU-NGOs when required, in seminars initiated 
in the South by Southern NGOs or other civil society organisations. The 
seminar was a major step in pooling such resources.
<P>
One of the principal mechanisms at the disposal of the Liaison 
Committee project on decentralised co-operation is a NEWSLETTER aimed 
primarily for circulation in the South. This should 
 facilitate dialogue and the sharing of experiences on decentralised 
co-operation among institutional actors, perceived by Southern and EU-NGOs 
as playing a crucial role for the success of decentralised co-operation. 
The newsletter will be launched in March. Six issues are planned on a 
quarterly basis.
<P>
<H4>How far can a newsletter function as a resource centre on decentralised co-operation?</H4>
<P>
The success of the Liaison Committee Newsletter project in 
evolving into a source of alternative information, policy discussion 
and exchange of experiences made in decentralised co-operation 
by NGOs in the South and the EU, with a broad base in civil society, 
will largely depend on the involvement of the 800 NGOs of the fifteen 
EU-platforms of the Liaison Committee, in identifying Southern NGOs 
and other partners to whom the newsletter should be initially sent, 
for feedback, evaluation or information.n
<P>
The organisers take this occasion to thank resource 
persons from GRET and CCFD (France), Movimondo (Italy), FES, EZE 
and DED (Germany), SNV, ICCO and ECDPM (NL), COTA (Belgium), 
as well as Mwengo (Zimbabwe), Search (India), Fonhsud (Haiti), 
SIC (Senegal), Proshikha (Bangladesh), the former 
co-ordinator from CPDC (Barbados), and the decentralised co-operation 
unit of the European Commission, for their contributions.

<HR>
<P>
<B>In May 1994 the Working Group on Participatory Development
and Good Governance  established by the Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) of the OECD met for the  first time. Klemens van
de Sand, head of planning at the German Federal Ministry for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), was elected chairman.
The group  elaborated recommendations for a segment of its tasks
which were adopted at the DAC's  34th High Level Meeting held
in May this year. Van de Sand summarises the group's work  to
date.</B>
<P>
The industrial nation members of the  DAC have never lacked for
statements  on donor coordination. But practice at  developing
country level has often been  different. The sea change in  international
politics in 1989/90 at first  also made little difference to that
 situation. As the DAC's 1994 report  noted <a href="#1">(1)</a>, due to the dramatically
 worsening economic and budgetary  problems in all industrial
nations, &quot;the  commercial pressure on development  assistance
has in fact grown in recent  years&quot;, and thereby the competitive
 pressure on the donors.
<P>
Recently, however, the forces in the  OECD that oppose the overemphasis
of  national egotism in international  relations appear to be
gaining ground. In  contrast to the champions of an  undifferentiated
multilateral approach in  the  1970s and 1980s, they put their
faith  in a &quot;new global partnership&quot; <a href="#2">(2)</a> between  bilateral
and multilateral development  cooperation organizations and their
 government and NGO partners in the  developing countries.
<P>
The most recent expression of this  partnership approach was two
DAC  decisions at cabinet minister level (High  Level Meeting
of May 1996). These were  the report Shaping the 21st Century:
The  Contribution of Development  Cooperation <a href="#3">(3)</a>, and the Policy
Note on  Strengthening Country Level  Coordination for Participatory
 Development and Good Governance <a href="#4">(4)</a>.  The 22 DAC members documented
with  both declarations their will to define  more concretely
the goals and strategies  of development cooperation, and above
 all to coordinate its implementation  where it has practical
relevance:  in country.
<P>
<B>Development strategy for the 21st  century?</B>
<P>
Paradoxically, the new trend of  cooperation can be attributed
to the  same internal economic and budgetary  problems that have
also intensified the  competition among the industrial  nations.
<P>
Even more than the public scepticism  over development aid which
is  increasing everywhere, the funding crisis  that has led to
heavy cuts in development  budgets, above all in the USA, Canada
 and some Scandinavian countries, with  unforeseeable impacts
on the  multilateral system, has moved  development administrations
to reflect  on the future of their cooperation.
<P>
The report on the DAC's one year  <I>exercice de</I> <I>reflexion,
</I>as it was officially  called, contains some points that are
 definitely open to criticism. One may  doubt if it will live
up to its rather  high flown title, Shaping the 21st  Century.
It was, however, a remarkable  achievement that in a situation
which  shows crisis like tendencies, and not  only in the development
policy sector, the  industrial nations were able to agree on 
a comprehensive strategy paper  containing such trend setting statements
 as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Despite disappointments, development policy is also a success
story. (As  proof, the report cites among other  things the &quot;green
revolution&quot;, the  decline in poverty, sickness and birth
 rates in many countries, and an  improved physical and social
 infrastructure.)<P>
<li>Despite foreign trade pressures, the donor community acknowledges
anew and with emphasis that reducing poverty is the paramount
goal of development  policy.<P>
<li>The DAC defines clear indicators  (standard of living,
literacy, access for  girls to the educational system, infant
 and maternal mortality) as the  yardstick of the success of 
development policy. (It thereby  distances itself from the prevailing
 focusing of the debate, including in  Germany, on quantitative
transfer  inputs, which ignores the qualitative  prerequisites
and criteria of success  for development processes.)<P>
<li>At the same time, the DAC  acknowledges the need for an
 &quot;appropriate and calculable&quot; financing,  particularly
in multilateral work, and an  increase in ODA volumes.<P>
<li>Partnership means mainly the  responsibility of the developing
 countries, but no shabby blaming them  for a lack of development
success. The  document emphasises the need for  political action
by the industrial nations  beyond development policy (debt  forgiveness,
trade, etc.).<P>
<li>Partnership and cooperation  presuppose reciprocal obligations
 based on fundamental values (human  rights, participation, social
justice,  protection of natural resources).</ul>
<P>
The entire paper is based on a simple finding: nothing helps development so
much as its success. True, conjured up appeals that it is a question of securing the
future for all people  that, of course, is also in the document  are essentially correct.
But they are obviously not enough to transform the public's lethargy
and scepticism into support for development policy. The
taxpayer must also be convinced that  development assistance works.
<P>
<B>Greater effectiveness by in-country  coordination</B>
<P>
The DAC's awareness that a quite  considerable potential for the
 much quoted &quot;increase of effectiveness&quot;  lies in improved
coordination was a  start point for its second decision, the  Policy
Note on Strengthening Country  Level Coordination for Participatory
 Development and Good Governance.  The document concretises the
strategy  paper in an essential area. Political  agreements between
the donors give  extra weight to their dialogues with the  partner
governments. Concentration and  division of labour tie up fewer
capacities  of all involved, and boost the impact of all  development
projects.
<P>
The background: the changed political  constellation at the beginning
of the   1990s allowed the conclusion to be drawn  that, first
and foremost, bad governance  was responsible for the wretched
 development in parts of Asia, in Latin  America, and above all
in Africa. Putting it  positively, the systems of government 
must be more efficient, more calculable,  more socially responsible
and thereby  more stable. State powers must be  divided and decentralised.
Because  these virtues are also prerequisites for  economic growth
and internal peace, the  German Minister for Economic  Cooperation
and Development (BMZ),  Carl-Dieter Spranger, in 1991 put into
 place the five most important general  development promoting conditions
as  criteria for applying development  cooperation instruments
and funds.
<P>
Right from the start, the BMZ pursued  the strategy of tackling
the reorientation  of development policy together with other 
donor countries instead of a national  go-it-alone. In that approach
it could count  on the commitment of the &quot;like-minded&quot;
 countries, especially in the Netherlands,  Scandinavia, Canada
and the USA. The  finding in the World Bank's Development  Report
of 1990 that reducing poverty was  above all a problem of the
political  balances of power in the developing  countries was
also trailblazing.  (Although in implementing this finding,  the
Bank was hampered not only by its  mandate as a finance institute,
but also   at any rate until James Wolfensohn  became its president
 by its staff's  &quot;economic&quot; orientation.)
<P>
In November 1991 the Council of  Europe drew up a Resolution on
human  rights, democracy and development that  largely corresponded
with the BMZ  criteria and the
conceptual reasoning behind them.  Among other things, at BMZ
pressure the  DAC paid more attention to this theme,  and in December
1993 adopted its  Orientations on Participatory  Development and
Good Governance  (PD/GG). This 30 page document  contains recommendations
for  development policy in the sectors: 1.  Participatory development;
2.  Democratisation; 3. Good governance  (including the rule of
law, public  accountability, control of corruption,  reduction
of excessive arms spending);  4. Human rights.
<P>
At the same time, the DAC High Level  Meeting commissioned a Working
Group  on Participatory Development and Good  Governance, which
was set up for an  initial three years, to process the DAC  members'
various experiences in these  sectors and deduce from them specific
 recommendations for development  cooperation. The working group
focused  on the following five subjects: the role of  civil society
in the democratisation  process; promotion of human rights;  judicial
reform; decentralisation and  &quot;local democracy&quot;; and
coordination  in country, as well as in the Consultative  Groups
(CGs) and Round Tables (RTs)  organised by the World Bank or UNDP.
 In the latter sector, the group completed  its work with the
Policy Note referred to  above.
<P>
<B>Joint country assessments as  basis for cooperation</B>
<P>
The Policy Note defined strengthening  the partner governments'
 self responsibility and promoting their  cooperation with civil
society  organisations (CSOs) as a general  objective for country
level coordination.  Thereby the DAC members assume that  improvements
of the political,  administrative and legal general  conditions,
in particular &quot;through  constructive dialogue rather than
the  adoption of absolute standards or  models&quot;, can be achieved.
<P>
The Policy Note adds that the  foundation for PD/GG discussions
 should be a process of in-country  assessment of the status of
PD/GG  issues as defined in the DAC  Orientations, and which focuses
on the  general conditions not covered by the  World Bank's country
reports. These  assessments should not be produced  solely by
donor organisations in the  developing countries, but together
with  independent research institutes,  especially from developing
countries.  The country assessments are then to be  discussed
with the government and  CSOs, &quot;including those representing
the  poor and less politically engaged, in  order to work out
strategies and support activities which could then be  incorporated in donor
programmes&quot;.
<P>
In countries where institutions and the  capacity to undertake
such reviews are  still lacking, the DAC members' priority  would
be to help build such capacity  both in government and civil society.
 Wherever possible, the members aim to  draw on the expertise
of other  developing countries that already have  the required
capacity.
<P>
<B>NGO networks in developing  countries</B>
<P>
On the need to build the capacity of the  CSOs, the Policy Note
takes up in  condensed form the demands of a  workshop on their
role in the  democratisation process which the  Scandinavian members
of the working  group held in Uppsala <a href="#5">(5)</a>:
<P>
<ul>
<li>In order to establish themselves as  dialogue partners
of not only their  governments but also the donor  organisations,
and influence general  conditions at the macro level, the  CSOs
in the developing countries  must do exactly what the German 
NGOs have just done with the founding  of VENRO (Association of
 Non Governmental Organisations):  build networks.
<P>
<li>The CSOs must determine their own  professional and ethical
standards  and legitimise themselves as  respectable cooperation
partners.
<P>
<li>The DAC members should help CSOs  to develop their professional
efficiency  and thus also their capacity for  dialogue, and share
expertise with  them. &quot; For example, interested donors  and
CSOs could establish  independent funds, managed  cooperatively,
for financing activities  such as information dissemination, 
networking, promotion of public  awareness, and training.&quot;
(This idea  had its origins in a fund set up by  Denmark in Eastern
Europe, but also  in elements of the &quot;self administered 
capital assets&quot; formula of German  Technical Cooperation.)</ul>
<P>
<B>Criteria for NGOs</B>
<P>
The building of networks and  elaboration of criteria for cooperation
 with and among NGOs has  this is  inserted here  played a major
role not  only in Uppsala, but, for example, also at  the BMZ-initiated
&quot;quadrilogue&quot; of  German and Ghanaian NGOs in Ghana
 in July 1995, as well as in Sri Lanka in  May 1996 at a conference
organised by  the Konrad Adenauer Foundation of  representatives
of NGOs, research  institutes and Southeast Asian  governments
on the status of  participation and poverty reduction in the 
policies of the SAARC governments. I regard this discussion as
 exceptionally significant and topical for  several reasons. Almost
all bilateral  donors, and not least also the World  Bank group,
provide more and more  funds for the promotion of the &quot;civil
 society&quot;. The &quot;Micro credit Summit&quot; next  year
is to muster further hundreds of  millions of dollars for this
sector.  Accordingly, NGOs are everywhere  shooting up like mushrooms.
Many are  founded by the established elite only in  order to secure
their accustomed  sinecures and &quot;mop up&quot; the flow of
 money diverted from the government  sector to the NGOs. On the
other hand,  there can be no doubt that in view of the  failure
of governments, new and dynamic  CSOs in many countries, above
all in  Africa and Latin America, offer new hope.  Their role
lies not only in assuming  substitute functions, but especially
in  organising the participation of the poor  and thus challenging
governments to  fulfil their core tasks. Ever more  governments
are responding to this  process of empowerment by attempting 
to regulate the CSOs' scope by laws and  decrees which go far
beyond the  legitimate interests of the state, and  binding NGOs
to activities which are in  accordance with the constitution and
 oriented to public well being. In this  ambivalent situation,
it is in the urgent  interest of not only the donor  organisations,
but also the NGOs, to go  on the offensive in countering the 
threatening degradation of promoting  development through CSOs.
<P>
The current status of the debate  suggests the following general
criteria  for the cooperation of NGOs, not only  among each other,
but also with donor  organisations:
<P>
<ul>
<li>independence from the government;
<P>
<li>democratic and transparent organisational structure;
<P>
<li>broad-based representation among the people;
<P>
<li>open membership;
<P>
<li>responsible, efficient management;
<P>
<li>clear and specific objectives; and
<P>
<li>readiness for cooperation and for  collaboration on structural
reforms.</ul>
<P>
These criteria are not to be treated as  absolute minimum standards,
but as  benchmarks subject to review which are  to be realised
in a dynamic process.  They are to be modified according to the
 type of organisation and purpose  involved or  for finance organisations,
 for example  widened. Thus features  such as &quot;broad-based
representation&quot;  and &quot;open membership&quot; have greater
 relevance for self-help organisations  than for intermediary service
or human  rights organisations.
<P>
With regard to participatory  development, the criterion &quot;readiness
for  cooperation&quot; is especially important. It  demands of
the NGOs that they review  their role in the development process
 and, if necessary, redefine it.  Consequently, the strategic
objective of  getting to grips with the structural  causes of
poverty applies also to the  work of the NGOs. It can then no
longer  be &quot;only&quot; a matter of implementing more  or
less isolated projects at the  micro-level and seeking to alleviate
the  symptoms and impacts of wrong  development. &quot;Social
mobilisation&quot; and  &quot;capacity building&quot; are not limited
to the   still important  task of strengthening  self-help forces
in a bid to satisfy  material needs. What is more important  is
seeing that the poor have influence on  political and economic
power structures.  Building networks and alliances of  NGOs facilitates
such influence, and by  bundling different interests creates more
 clout for the civil sector as a whole.
<P>
This &quot;pattern change&quot; in the NGOs  perception of development
presents an  enormous challenge, especially for  those of the
South. The work of classic  NGOs in many countries is still  characterised
by fragmentation, jealousies and rivalry, paternalism  and the
striving for dominance of more or  less charismatic leading personalities.
 But solidarity among NGOs is a must if  as the counsel for the
poor they want to  have a constructive influence on national 
development policies and oppose the  repression attempts of governments.
<P>
Equally, this principle  which is also  the basis of the Policy
Note  demands  changes in the attitude and behaviour of  the government
and NGO &quot;donors&quot; of the  North. Their current promotion
policies  are part of the problem. So long as the  NGOs of the
South are financially  supported on a narrow project basis,  they
must align their concepts and  organizational structures largely
ad hoc  on the implementation of individual  projects. This means
it is difficult for  them to develop into a driving force of 
structural changes. In this respect, the  innovative forms of
cooperation  addressed in the Policy Note are viewed  as very
important.
<P>
<B>Flexible process</B>
<P>
The Policy Note emphasises in  several places that the coordinating
 mechanisms in the PD/GG sector  should be flexible and adjusted
to the  conditions of each country. The  discussion on PD/GG matters
should be  integrated into existing in country  coordination forums,
such as those  already in place in a number of  countries on certain
sectors or general  conditions. These include strengthening  the
justice system in Haiti, important  political events such as elections,
or  implementing the peace agreements in  El Salvador and Mozambique.
According  to the respective political conditions,  coordinating
bodies could be set up  alternatively or cumulatively between
the  various actors. Between donor-country  embassies and development
 cooperation offices, between donors and  partner governments,
between donors  and CSOs, and  wherever possible   between donors,
governments and  CSOs of the partner country. The Policy  Note
says the primary role of in country  donor groups would be to facilitate
 PD/GG through promotion of dialogue,  exchange of information
and  coordination of external support with  partner country institutions
and groups. It  adds that in polarized situations the  group would
be a donor reference point  for the factual basis of significant
 incidents, thus contributing to  appropriate donor reactions
to political  trends and events.
<P>
However, flexibility does not mean  do-as-you-please. If governments
 adamantly refuse to talk about general  conditions and
participation of CSOs, that will impact on the extent and type
of cooperation on offer to  them. In this respect, the objectives
of country  level coordination (strengthening the self responsibility
and cooperation of CSOs) also imply the conditionality of promotion.
<P>
 <B>Coordination with the World Bank and UNDP</B>
<P>
One of the Policy Note's main concerns is the meshing of the in country
coordination  process with the World Bank's Consultative  Groups
(CG) and the UNDP's Round Tables  (RT). On behalf of the working
group, the DAC  Secretariat evaluated all meetings of the CGs
 and a number of those of the RTs from 1990  on the basis of how
they had handled  problems in the sectors of human rights,  democratisation
and the rule of law. The  finding was ambivalent. On the one hand,
 obstacles to development in the sectors of  human rights and
general conditions were  discussed at almost all meetings, including
 those with Asian countries. On the other hand,  this took place
as a rule without systematic  preparation and follow up. So the
successes  of the donors' united actions, such as the  removal
of the dictatorships in Zambia and  Malawi, and in the peace process
in El  Salvador, remained exceptions rather| than the rule. Especially
recently, complaints have mounted from participants, including
German delegates, that the formal sessions of some CGs are increasingly
 rigidifying into rituals. They also  complain that the informal
meetings on  political and legal general conditions are  surprised
by individual participants with  uncoordinated
 ventures, so that a well founded dialogue  targeted on results
is hardly possible.  The DAC members aim to remedy this  situation.
The Policy Note says: &quot;In view  of the vital connection between
PD/GG  and sustainable development, the  importance of PD/GG in
donors' aid  allocation decisions, and experiences in  recent
CG and RT discussions, DAC  members support, as a medium term 
objective, the systematic treatment of  these issues in CGs and
RTs in a  manner suited to their nature and  importance in each
specific country  context.... Broad-based, in country  consultations
... could lead to the  identification of actions and  commitments
on the part of the partner  country and its donors and of points
 under active debate to be addressed as  a matter of priority.
Presentations (of the  findings) could be made to the plenary
of  the CG or RT meeting by lead speakers  participating in the
in country process.  The output of the CG or RT meeting should
 be monitored through in country  coordination mechanisms and reviewed
 in the next CG or RT meeting.&quot;
<P>
At the High Level Meeting,  UNDP Administrator Gus Speth and the
 World Bank representative emphatically  backed these recommendations.
 However, the World Bank pointed out that  because of its statutes
it had problems  in chairing CG meetings when human  rights issues
were raised as separate  agenda points. In the view of the working
 group, this problem should be resolved  by the participants from
case to case. As  a rule, this can be done by framing the  agenda
adequately (&quot;Good governance&quot;  comes indisputably within
the World  Bank's mandate!). If necessary, a  bilateral donor
could take over the chair  for a time.
<P>
<B>Step-by-step implementation</B>
<P>
The Policy Note's findings,  recommendations and decisions are,
of  course, at the moment only on paper.  True, the DAC members
in Paris  reached consensus at High Level. But  that does not
mean the many sceptics in  the donor capitals and embassies, who
 can cite the practice that has prevailed to  date, no longer
have to be convinced.  One may certainly have doubts about the
 extent to which the in country donor  offices can provide sufficient
qualified  staff to meet the additional requirements.  (The DAC's
&quot;exams&quot; have for years rightly  criticized Germany in
particular for not  staffing its embassies with the right  numbers
of development officers!)
<P>
The goal of achieving binding  agreements in the sector of political,
 legal and administrative general  conditions through institutionalized
 dialogue is certainly ambitious. However,  it appears realizable
if donors proceed  pragmatically, flexibly and at the same  time
systematically, in line with the  recommendations. The DAC intends
to  begin the coordination process at first in  some pilot countries.
Individual donors,  including Germany, have said they are  prepared
to assume ultimate  responsibility for them.
<P>
It also sounds optimistic that the new  trend to coordination
will not be limited to  the OECD. At Germany's suggestion, the
 EU and its members are also testing  systematic and binding forms
of  operational coordination in six pilot  countries. These, however,
relate to  sectors and regions, not general  conditions. The World
Bank is organizing  sectoral investment programmes to be  implemented
by partner governments  and several donors. The particular  appeal
of these programmes is that without coordination they would in
no way  come about. (Thereby, however, the  political and administrative
 preconditions must not be overlooked   as has happened with many
structural  adjustment programmes!)
<P>
Not least, the DAC's decision on joint  assessments of general
conditions and  agreement on reform steps can  contribute to preventing
armed conflicts.  Political and social events will inevitably
 be much more transparent if there is  regular communication between
the  relevant government and social forces.  There will then be
no need to rack one's  brains over new early warning systems.
<P>
Regular communication delivers a  harmonized donor information
base.  That creates the basis for joint strategies  to handle
threatening crises. (Not least,  that was lacking in, for example,
Rwanda  and Burundi!) The Policy Note implies  this point without
going into further  details. The international forum on  Development
Cooperation as Preventive  Peace Policy, organized by the German
 Foundation for International  Development (DSE) and BMZ in Berlin,
 April 912 this year, gave it more tangible  form. The forum recommended
that not only partner governments, but also  opposition leaders
and relevant social  organizations, should be tied in to the 
consultations on crisis prevention.  Together with them, attempts
must be  made from case to case to reach  agreements on specific
measures, and  the monitoring of them. International  conferences
on preventing or mediating  in conflicts would take on a new quality
if  they could fall back on such a  consultation process. This
would apply  both to the preparation and the  implementation of
the findings.
<P>
To return to the opening question, the  conceptional prerequisites
for greater  efficiency in development cooperation  and more joint
action by the donors are in  place. The core of this concept of
 &quot;operational participation&quot; is that  cooperation between
governments and  civil society organizations based on  equality
is an essential element for  structural changes, in both the social
 and government sector. A new quality of  cooperation and partnership
must now  manifest itself in concrete and continual  steps in
in country practice.

<H3>Some Lessons from the Luxembourg experience</H3>

<P>
by <I>Gaston Stronck</I> 
<P>
Full text of an article from <I>DPMN Bulletin, 2(1) April 1994:
pages 10-11</I> </CENTER><HR>

<H4>Historical Setting</H4>

<P>
Luxembourg is a founding member of a number of international organisations
-- e.g. Benelux and the European Union (EU) in the economic field
and WEU and NATO in the political field. The impact of these regional
institutions on the content of national policies has increased
enormously over the half century since the end of the Second World
War. As a consequence Luxembourg has had to establish both formal
and informal administrative processes to ensure that it participates
effectively in the determination of regional policies and their
implementation.
<P>
The Luxembourg experience is presented neither as a model nor
as a set of solutions for implementation in other countries. It
is nothing more than one experience among many. However other
countries may find some elements of the experience to be interesting
and relevant as they confront similar problems.
<H4>Impact on Determination of Regional Policies</H4>

<P>
The potential for any one country to control, or even influence,
regional policy will be limited. It is clear that small countries
such as Luxembourg are likely to carry less weight than larger
countries. Nevertheless this constraint can be reduced if governments
of small countries show genuine commitment to regional objectives
or if they play an active role in the discussion and determination
of regional policies in general or of those policies in which
they have a particular interest. 
<P>
What undermines the ability of any country to have an impact on
regional policies, is when its government is unable to concentrate
on these policies because its concerns are overwhelmingly on domestic
political problems or because it faces strong opposition from
key domestic interest groups.
<P>
The impact of a country on regional policy is also significantly
influenced by the extent to which its government has organised
itself for this purpose. This applies to the establishment of
a capacity to undertake policy analysis, to the development of
effective decision-making processes within government, and to
the creation of a capacity to participate actively in regional
decision-making.
<P>
Having said this, it will be apparent that one general conclusion
of this paper which can be anticipated right now, is that the
national management of regional relations does not differ basically
from normal national management of domestic affairs. If the administrative
system to manage domestic policy is lacking in quality and performance
it cannot be expected that it will be any better in managing regional
policy. Presented more positively, what the paper also concludes
is that a well organised, efficient and motivated national administration
should have no difficulties in coping with the management of regional
cooperation.
<H4>Policy Analysis and Policy Decision-Making</H4>

<P>
The ability to participate effectively in regional decision-making
will depend on adequate preparatory work having been under- taken
within the national administration and on the subsequent effectiveness
of procedures within the administration for reaching agreed policy-decisions
on regional issues. Several factors are important in this regard:
<UL>
<LI>Civil servants can only operate efficiently if they have general
guidelines on policy which are defined at the highest political
level.
</UL>

<P>
 
<UL>
<LI>The clear division of responsibilities between ministries
has to be respected by civil servants. This is particularly important
when these divisions have arisen out of the political negotiations
lying behind the formation of coalition governments.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A high degree of delegation of power from the political level
to the administration.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Coherence in the administrative apparatus which, in its turn,
requires a high degree of administrative tradition and culture.
This cannot, of course, be established in the short run. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Although it is developed as a continuous process, it is not self-generating.
It emerges from continuous attention by governments and senior
civil servants acting in a professional manner. It then requires
determined action in the light of experiences.
<UL>
<LI>Coordination, both formal and informal, is necessary, and
this must be based on a good flow of information. Formal mechanisms
of coordination are necessary but are sometimes too slow and cumbersome.
Thus the crucial importance of informal coordination has to be
stressed and civil servants educated and encouraged to use these
informal procedures.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Where coordination fails to lead to agreement, a process is
required to resolve internal conflicts with credible mechanisms
of arbitration.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>As far as possible, there should be similarity between administrative
procedures at the national and at the regional levels.
</UL>

<P>

<H4>Participation in Regional Decision-Making</H4>

<P>
However efficiently national analytical work and decision-making
might be undertaken, to be effective there must be a capacity
to negotiate effectively at the regional level. The following
factors are important in this regard:
<UL>
<LI>There needs to be excellent knowledge of the institutional
and procedural setting of the regional organisations. For instance,
of particular importance for a member of the European Union is
whether on any issue decision is by majority vote or whether a
veto power exists. If it is the former then concessions and compromises
might be preferable to being out-voted. While a veto power in
principle confers more power on each country and especially on
small countries such as Luxembourg, in practice too frequent a
use of this power will weaken goodwill towards a country and thereby
damage its own long-term interests.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The quality of national administrators in negotiation skills
and techniques is important. Regional negotiations involve extensive
tactical manoeuvring and are typically focussed on technical matters
rather than on issues of broad policy. The competence of individual
negotiators varies not so much between states as between individual
representatives.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Efficient networking between those at the interface between
national and regional bodies. Every civil servant should know
his counterparts in the regional system. In the European Union
regular attendance at meetings of the Council and of the Commission
facilitates this process.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The development of efficient procedures to link the national
administration to the regional organisation. Significant variations
exist in the ways in which governments attempt and are able to
control their inputs into the regional cooperation system. Some
countries, such as Luxembourg, allow their representatives to
work in a fairly loose framework. Other states tend to be reluctant
to negotiation on policy issues below ministerial level. In the
European Union, the permanent representation in Brussels has to
play a key role and with the growth of the workload these mechanisms
have to be constantly improved.
</UL>

<P>

<H4>Implementation of Regional Policies</H4>

<P>
Decision made at the regional level which are not then implemented,
make no sense. Several factors are important in this regard:
<UL>
<LI>The political commitment to regional decisions perhaps disregarding
the more 'technical' details.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Flexibility and loyalty to decisions at the administrative
level by those managing regional cooperation.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Adequate instruments and means to implement regional decisions.
Implementing European Union regulations and directives requires
appropriate administrative skills and in certain circumstances
financial means.<P>
<LI>Coordination through a well organised flow of information.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Systematic and institutionalised monitoring and control of
implementation including recognition of the timetable agreed at
regional level.
</UL>

<P>

<H4>Concluding Comment</H4>

<P>
In the case of Luxembourg, regional cooperation has created no
major change in the style of administrative behaviour because
working with different levels of autonomous decision-centres was
already a central part of the daily life of civil servants. Also
a general openness toward partners, governmental or social, as
well a predisposition to seek a consensus and avoid deep conflicts,
is part of the Luxembourg administrative style which has easily
been applied to the requirements of regional cooperation. A high
degree of administrative skill and experience, including a sufficient
degree of flexibility enables the Luxembourg administrators to
digest the acts of regional cooperation.
<P>
In addition, these administrators are being pushed to modify their
institutional processes by the environment in which they work.
The political leadership and economic and social interests in
regional cooperation also influence them. These interests have
access to information on regional issues and dispose of 'sanctions'
such as the courts or public opinion.
<P>
Thus both the internal motivation of administrators and the environment
in which they work create a dynamic situation which ensures that
they are always digesting new regional issues in an effective
manner. 
<P>
To conclude where we began. The requirements for effective national
institutions to manage regional cooperation do not differ basically
from those required to manage domestic policies. A well-organised,
well-trained and well-motivated national administration should
have no difficulties in managing regional cooperation.<HR>

<B>Alemania quiere ayudar a asegurar el futuro del mundo. Pero
en la pr&aacute;ctica se registra una disminuci&oacute;n de las
prestaciones y un creciente escepticismo entre la poblaci&oacute;n
alemana. Necesarios son m&aacute;s recursos financieros, m&aacute;s
efectividad y eficiencia, m&aacute;s influencia en otras &aacute;reas
pol&#237;ticas y mejores relaciones p&uacute;blicas.</B>
<P>
<B>El origen</B>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n oficial alemana para el desarrollo comenz&oacute;
en 1952 con una participaci&oacute;n financiera en el programa
de ayuda de las Naciones Unidas destinado la cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica con pa&#237;ses del Tercer Mundo, as&#237; como con la
creaci&oacute;n, en 1956, del &quot;Fondo de 50 millones&quot;
 del ministerio de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica para la
ayuda bilateral. A partir de fines de la d&eacute;cada del cincuenta
el Parlamento Alem&aacute;n se comprometi&oacute; con una activa
pol&#237;tica Norte-Sur. El creciente volumen de la ayuda, administrada
por diversos ministerios, y los c&aacute;lculos pol&#237;ticos de la
coalici&oacute;n gubernamental de entonces, condujeron en 1961
a la fundaci&oacute;n del Ministerio Federal de Cooperaci&oacute;n
&eacute;con&oacute;mica (BMZ), del que Walter Scheel fue su primer
ministro. En 1993 se agregaron al nombre del ministerio las palabras
&quot;y Desarrollo&quot;.
<P>
Inicialmente el BMZ no era nada m&aacute;s que un ministerio de
coordinaci&oacute;n. En 1984 recibi&oacute; el encargo de elaborar
los principios y programas de la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo y de la
cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica, y en 1972, bajo la conducci&oacute;n
del ministro socialdem&oacute;crata Erhard Eppler, se hizo cargo
de la cooperaci&oacute;n financiera bilateral y multilateral.
Reci&eacute;n con esa medida la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo se estableci&oacute;
de hecho como &aacute;rea pol&#237;tica aut&oacute;noma.
<P>
<B>Aspectos cuantitativos</B>
<P>
De acuerdo con el volumen de la ayuda oficial para el desarrollo
(AOD), Alemania se ubica entre los mayores donantes (1993: 11,5
mil millones de marcos o bien 8,95 mil millones de d&oacute;lares),
y alcanza, despu&eacute;s de Jap&oacute;n, Estados Unidos y Francia,
el cuarto lugar. Si se calcula, sin embargo, la relaci&oacute;n
existente entre la AOD con el producto social bruto, Alemania
alcanza una posici&oacute;n intermedia entre los 21 donantes que
pertenecen al Comit&eacute; de Ayuda para el Desarrollo (CAD)
de la Organizaci&oacute;n &eacute;con&oacute;mica para la Cooperaci&oacute;n
y el Desarrollo (OECD) (en 1993, con 0,36% ocup&oacute; el noveno
puesto).
<P>
La evaluaci&oacute;n del volumen de la AOD depende del marco de
referencia que se emplee. Si bien las prestaciones p&uacute;blicas
de ayuda para el desarrollo  por ejemplo en relaci&oacute;n con
el comercio exterior que Alemania mantiene con pa&#237;ses en desarrollo
(las exportaciones y las importaciones alcanzaron en 1993 cerca
de 200 mil millones de d&oacute;lares)  resultan m&aacute;s bien
marginales, superaron por otra parte con creces las prestaciones
privadas, que se transfieren a pa&#237;ses en desarrollo bajo las condiciones
que reinan usualmente en el mercado.
<P>
Lo que nadie discute es que Alemania a&uacute;n no alcanza la
meta del 0,7% establecida por las Naciones Unidas para la relaci&oacute;n
entre la AOD y el producto social bruto, meta con la que se volvi&oacute;
a comprometer el gobierno alem&aacute;n en 1992, en la Conferencia
de Rio, pero de la cual se ha alejado paulatinamente en los a&ntilde;os
recientes. El nivel m&aacute;s alto en esta relaci&oacute;n entre
AOD y producto lo alcanz&oacute; Alemania en 1982/1983, cuando
lleg&oacute; al 0,48%. Desde 1990 (0,42 %) se ha venido registrando
una disminuci&oacute;n de la cuota (1993: 0,36%) y para 1995 se
prev&eacute; un 0,32%.
<P>
Pero Alemania no es el &uacute;nico pa&#237;s con cifras semejantes
en el selecto c&#237;rculo de los donantes del CAD. En numerosos pa&#237;ses
donantes los presupuestos p&uacute;blicos de ayuda para el desarrollo
acusan desde hace algunos a&ntilde;os una disminuci&oacute;n,
de modo que con todo derecho puede hablarse de una crisis financiera
de la AOD internacional en general. Si se la mice en relaci&oacute;n
con el promedio del CAD (1990: 0,33%; 1993: 0,30%) puede establecerse
que la disminuci&oacute;n de la cuota alemana entre la AOD y el
producto bruto supera dicho promedio. Para explicar la disminuci&oacute;n
se hace referencia a menudo a que el sector p&uacute;blico debe
ahorrar imperiosamente. Pero no puede perderse de vista que la
importancia de la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo tambi&eacute;n
disminuye relativamente dentro del presupuesto total alem&aacute;n.
Al comparar la parte que corresponde al presupuesto del BMZ  que
comprende la mayor parte de la AOD (ver tabla 1) con el presupuesto
global, se observa que el primero disminuy&oacute; de 2,4% (1989)
a 1,7% (1995) del presupuesto,  el mayor nivel que alcanz&oacute;
fue del 2,6%  y todo hace pensar que no aumentar&aacute; por lo
menos hasta 1998.
<P>
A la cooperaci&oacute;n alemana para el desarrollo pertenecen
tambi&eacute;n  junto a las prestaciones de car&aacute;cter p&uacute;blico
 las prestaciones para el desarrollo dadas por las organizaciones
no gubernamentales (por ej. de las Iglesias, fundaciones u asociaciones),
que provienen de recursos propios y/o de donaciones. En el transcurso
del tiempo &eacute;stas han tenido un volumen que sorprende por
su constancia  de 11 % al 12 % de la ayuda oficial  y es importante
separarlas de las subvenciones que obtienen estas organizaciones
por parte del Estado.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="images/tabla1.gif"></center>
<P>
<B>Qui&eacute;n da ayuda para el desarrollo?</B>
<P>
En la ayuda oficial alemana para el desarrollo hay una considerable
variedad de actores. Ello es v&aacute;lido tanto para el financiamiento
(oferta de los recursos) como para la realizaci&oacute;n (al respecto
ver abajo) de los proyectos. Las prestaciones de la AOD alemanas registradas ante el CAD comprenden:
<P>
<ul>

de la AOD, el BMZ constituye el principal actor.
<P>
<li>Prestaciones de otros ministerios alemanes, sobre todo
del ministerio de RR EE (ayuda humanitaria, ayuda para equipamiento,

y del ministerio de econom&#237;a.

<P>
A ello se agrega la parte alemana que se destina a financiar el
presupuesto de desarrollo de la Uni&oacute;n Europea, los recursos
destinados a reducir el servicio de la deuda y la parte de los
recursos para la atenci&oacute;n de refugiados pol&#237;ticos en Alemania.
La participaci&oacute;n de diversos ministerios en el &aacute;rea
de la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo se halla m&aacute;s
difundida en otros pa&#237;ses donantes (por ej. en Francia y Jap&oacute;n).
<P>
Una especificidad de la ayuda para el desarrollo alemana es el
compromiso que han adquirido con ella los Estados federados, principalmente
en el &aacute;rea de la educaci&oacute;n, aunque desde hace algunos
a&ntilde;os
tambi&eacute;n han impulsado proyectos propios. Junto con los
Estados tambi&eacute;n se comprometen comunas en el marco de hermanamientos
de ciudades y de colaboraci&oacute;n comunal.

<B>Cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral  y multilateral</B>
<P>
La Rep&uacute;blica Federal de Alemania se ve a s&#237; misma en primer t&eacute;rmino
como donante bilateral (la parte de la AOD bilateral - es decir,
de la ayuda que se otorga directamente a los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo -
 dentro del conjunto de la AOD alemana asciende al 70% (Ver tabla
2). Alemania fundamenta esa posici&oacute;n principalmente con
la aspiraci&oacute;n de llevar a cabo, en su calidad de donante
importante, una pol&#237;tica propia de ayuda para el desarrollo. Para
la realizaci&oacute;n de ese objetivo dispone de un aparato diferenciado.
La consigna no escrita pudiera ser la siguiente: &quot;entregar
tanta ayuda bilateral como sea posible y tanta ayuda multilateral
como sea necesario&quot;.
<P>
Alemania es, despu&eacute;s de Jap&oacute;n y de Estados Unidos,
el tercer donante en importancia en la cooperaci&oacute;n multilateral
para el desarrollo (datos de 1993) y ocupa el primer lugar en
lo que se refiere a la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo de
la Uni&oacute;n Europea. Pese a los vaivenes (determinados en
primer lugar por el ritmo de pagos), Alemania ha mantenido el
objetivo anunciado en los a&ntilde;os setenta, es decir, transferir
alrededor del 30% de la AOD en forma multilateral, ha luchado
en las organizaciones multilaterales en ese sentido y abogado
por aplicar reformas que contribuyan a ello. Alemania ha descartado
dar pasos espectaculares (como el retiro de Estados Unidos y
Gran Breta&ntilde;a de la UNESCO). En el per&#237;odo comprendido entre
1950 y 1993, el 41,6% de las prestaciones multilaterales realizadas
por Alemania recay&oacute; en la Uni&oacute;n Europea; el 39,6%
en el Banco Mundial y los bancos regionales de desarrollo; el
14,7% en las instituciones y los fondos de las Naciones Unidas
y el 4,1% en el rubro &quot;otros&quot;.
<P>
Alemania ha respaldado siempre la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo
de la Comunidad Europea y luego de la Uni&oacute;n Europea (en
t&eacute;rminos estrictos, &eacute;sta es una instituci&oacute;n
supranacional y no multilateral), pero nunca ha tomado la iniciativa
a ese nivel, que obedece ante todo a intereses franceses y brit&aacute;nicos
y a iniciativas del Parlamento &eacute;uropeo. A diferencia de
Francia y Gran Breta&ntilde;a, cuya herencia colonial plasma fuertemente
la orientaci&oacute;n regional, Alemania ha mostrado desde el
inicio su preferencia por una mayor globalizaci&oacute;n de la
cooperaci&oacute;n comunitaria para el desarrollo. Dos puntos
de cr&#237;tica alemanes: del Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo fluyen
pocos recursos hacia las empresas alemanas (a diferencia de lo
que sucede con las francesas) y la ayuda de la Uni&oacute;n Europea
tiene escasa eficiencia.
<P>
El gobierno alem&aacute;n exige desde hace tiempo una mejor coordinaci&oacute;n
da la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo en la Uni&oacute;n
Europea, pero no una mayor &quot;comunitarizaci&oacute;n&quot;
de la cooperaci&oacute;n de los pa&#237;ses miembros. (&eacute;sa es
la raz&oacute;n por la cual en el &aacute;rea de la cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica el gobierno alem&aacute;n muestra tantas reservas
pese a los esfuerzos que despleg&oacute; en favor de la Uni&oacute;n
Europea). En este sentido el Tratado de Maastricht, que establece
la complementariedad entre la cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo comunitaria y la bilateral, as&#237; como el precepto
de la coordinaci&oacute;n, se corresponde plenamente con las intenciones
del gobierno alem&aacute;n.
<P>
<B>Aspectos regionales</B>
<P>
A diferencia de Francia y Gran Breta&ntilde;a, cuya ayuda para
el desarrollo reflejan la vinculaci&oacute;n con las antiguas
colonias, y los Estados Unidos, cuya cooperaci&oacute;n para el
desarrollo se concentra regionalmente (en Israel y Egipto)
por motivos de seguridad, el gobierno alem&aacute;n se ha guiado
desde un comienzo por el principio de la apertura mundial de su
cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo. Esta posici&oacute;n, que
se debi&oacute; al principio a intereses de pol&#237;tica exterior
(lucha en favor del reconocimiento mundial de Alemania, impedir
el reconocimiento de la desaparecida RDA), le estamp&oacute;,
sin embargo, a la cooperaci&oacute;n alemana para el desarrollo
la fama de otorgar ayuda seg&uacute;n el principio de la regadera.
<P>
Se ajusta a esta caracter&#237;stica el gran n&uacute;mero de pa&#237;ses
con los cuales la Rep&uacute;blica Federal de Alemania tiene relaciones
de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica. En 1992 exist&#237;an en 150
pa&#237;ses proyectos de cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica en los estadios
de examen, preparaci&oacute;n o realizaci&oacute;n, y se anunciaron
aceptaciones nuevas a solicitudes presentadas por 130 pa&#237;ses para
cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica
(en la cooperaci&oacute;n financiera dichas cifras fueron de 105
y 66, respectivamente).
<P>
Pese a ello, la cooperaci&oacute;n alemana para el desarrollo
muestra una enorme concentraci&oacute;n. En el per&#237;odo 1950-93
el 26% de los pagos bilaterales netos de Alemania en materia de
AOD recay&oacute; en cinco principales receptores (India, Israel,
Egipto, Turqu&#237;a, Indonesia), y el 37% en s&oacute;lo diez
pa&#237;ses. Ello refleja tanto intereses de pol&#237;tica exterior como
geopoliticas.
<P>
La tabla 3 informa sobre la distribuci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n
alemana en materia de regiones. Queda de manifiesto que la parte
del Africa subsahariana se incrementa, mientras que la de Asia
ha disminuido. La parte recibida por los pa&#237;ses menos desarrollados
(LLDC) sufre considerablemente los vaivenes de la ayuda alemana,
y en 1993 correspondi&oacute; aproximadamente al promedio del
CAD. Otros donantes, como la Uni&oacute;n Europea o algunos pa&#237;ses
escandinavos, exhiben una participaci&oacute;n mayor de los LLDC.
<P>
Desde hace algunos a&ntilde;os el BMZ (en gran parte debido a
las exigencias de la comisi&oacute;n de presupuesto) realiza esfuerzos
por reducir el n&uacute;mero de pa&#237;ses receptores y alcanzar una
mayor concentraci&oacute;n regional de la ayuda. El motivo principal
es aumentar la efectividad y la eficiencia de la cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo a trav&eacute;s de su concentraci&oacute;n.
A ello se agrega la intenci&oacute;n de mantener la cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo s&oacute;lo con aquellos pa&#237;ses en donde las
condiciones marco de tipo pol&#237;tico y econ&oacute;mico favorecen
el &eacute;xito de la cooperaci&oacute;n. Paralelamente al esfuerzo
para reducir el n&uacute;mero de pa&#237;ses receptores surge una &quot;graduaci&oacute;n&quot;
de los pa&#237;ses emergentes, que se alejan cada vez m&aacute;s de
la necesidad de recibir ayuda. Por otra parte, han aparecido nuevos
pa&#237;ses que se han convertido en contrapartes de la cooperaci&oacute;n
alemana (Albania, as&#237; como los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo centroasi&aacute;ticos
y cauc&aacute;sicos, y Sur&aacute;frica).

<P>
<B>&#191;Ayuda para el Este a costa del Sur?</B>
<P>
Desde comienzos de los a&ntilde;os noventa la Rep&uacute;blica
Federal de Alemania ha respaldado el proceso de transformaciones
de los Estados de Europa Central y del Este y de
los Estados sucesores de la Uni&oacute;n Sovi&eacute;tica. Es
el principal donante occidental en t&eacute;rminos financieros
(en 1993 comprendi&oacute; cerca de dos tercios de las prestaciones
de todos los pa&#237;ses miembros del CAD). La ayuda oficial alemana
a los pa&#237;ses de Europa Central y del Este,  sin considerar
a los pa&#237;ses centroasi&aacute;ticos y cauc&aacute;sicos, que fueron
recientemente reconocidos por el CAD como pa&#237;ses en desarrollo
, y a Albania alcanz&oacute; en el per&#237;odo 1991-93 cerca de 8.400
millones de d&oacute;lares, lo que representa casi el 40% de la
AOD alemana otorgada a pa&#237;ses en desarrollo. Pero dicha ayuda
no se otorg&oacute; a costa del Sur, pues en su mayor parte no
proviene del BMZ. Aunque es natural que estos montos hayan recargado
el presupuesto federal.
<P>
<B>Principales aspectos sectoriales</B>
<P>
De la tabla 4 se deduce que la infraestructura social y administrativa
y la infraestructura econ&oacute;mica constituyen las principales
&aacute;reas que fomenta la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
bilateral alemana. Llaman la atenci&oacute;n en el per&#237;odo documentado
(1989-93) tres cosas: el peso casi constante de la infraestructura
social, la clara disminuci&oacute;n de la infraestructura econ&oacute;mica
y de los sectores productivos, as&#237; como el r&aacute;pido incremento
del aporte para la disminuci&oacute;n de la deuda y para la ayuda
humanitaria (esta &uacute;ltima contempla sobre todo la ayuda
a refugiados, que tambi&eacute;n se ha incrementado sorpresivamente
en algunos pa&#237;ses donantes).
<P>
La tabla 4 muestra los principales puntos por sector. Pero la
cooperaci&oacute;n alemana para el desarrollo, m&aacute;s exactamente
la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica, act&uacute;a en gran cantidad
de &aacute;reas. Ello obedece, por una parte, a la creciente diferenciaci&oacute;n
en los objetivos de la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo que se practica
desde los a&ntilde;os setenta, pero encierra al mismo tiempo el
peligro de una atomizaci&oacute;n sectorial (regadera sectorial).
<P>
Desde comienzos de los a&ntilde;os noventa el BMZ estima que los
aspectos principales de la cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral para el
desarrollo se sit&uacute;an en las siguientes tres &aacute;reas
claves: la lucha contra la pobreza, la protecci&oacute;n ambiental
y de recursos, as&#237; como la educaci&oacute;n, &aacute;reas que
deben complementarse con la promoci&oacute;n de la mujer. En
estos &quot;aspectos suprasectoriales principales&quot; - que
(con excepci&oacute;n de la educaci&oacute;n) son tareas transversales - deben concentrarse las medidas en favor del desarrollo dentro
de los diversos sectores y &aacute;reas, seg&uacute;n el BMZ.
<P>
Seg&uacute;n datos del BMZ, en los &uacute;ltimos tiempos, entre
el 40% y el 50% de las aprobaciones gubernamentales de proyectos
tuvieron relaci&oacute;n con la satisfacci&oacute;n de las necesidades
b&aacute;sicas (de ellas 13% para proyectos de lucha contra la
pobreza a trav&eacute;s de la ayuda al esfuerzo propio), alrededor
del 30 % con proyectos ambientales
y de preservaci&oacute;n de recursos (1988: 15%), y el 13% con
el &aacute;rea de educaci&oacute;n. Recolectar estad&#237;sticamente
datos con respecto a la pobreza no resulta f&aacute;cil y por
ello genera (algo que no sorprende) todo tipo de controversias.

<B>Instrumentos y condiciones de la cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral</B>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n alemana bilateral dispone esencialmente
de los siguientes instrumentos (se excluye un estudio detallado
por razones de espacio):
<P>
<ul>
<li><I><B>Cooperaci&oacute;n financiera (CF)</B></I>
<P>
Cr&eacute;ditos blancos (de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo
del pa&#237;s receptor, que van desde 0,75% a 2% de intereses, y 30
o 40 a&ntilde;os de plazo con 10 de gracia), o bien subvenciones
(para los pa&#237;ses menos desarrollados) para proyectos de inversi&oacute;n
y programas globales, as&#237; como ayuda en mercanc&#237;as y ayuda para
reformas estructurales; la ejecuci&oacute;n de la CF est&aacute;
a cargo de la Kreditanstalt f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau, KfW).
<P>
<li><I><B>Cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica (CT)</B> </I>
<P>
En sentido estricto: el envio de expertos,
as&#237; como la ayuda en equipamiento por encargo del gobierno federal
alem&aacute;n, en primer lugar a trav&eacute;s de la GTZ (Deutsche
Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Technische Zusammenarbeit). En un sentido
amplio: subvenciones para medidas de desarrollo implementadas
por organizaciones privadas.
<P>
<li><I><B>Cooperaci&oacute;n personal (CP)</B></I>
<P>
Particularmente formaci&oacute;n de personal especializado y de
direcci&oacute;n de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo (gratuitamente),
fundamentalmente a trav&eacute;s de la Fundaci&oacute;n Alemana
para el Desarrollo Internacional (DSE) y de la Sociedad Carl Duisberg
(CDG).
<P>
<li><I><B>Otras formas</B></I>
<P>
Ayuda alimentaria, fomento de la cooperaci&oacute;n de sectores
econ&oacute;micos alemanes con pa&#237;ses en desarrollo, fomento de
las exportaciones de pa&#237;ses en desarrollo.</ul>
<P>
<B>La cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica y la unificaci&oacute;n
alemana</B>
<P>
La unificaci&oacute;n de ambos Estados alemanes implic&oacute;
para la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo un ajuste que fue inferior al registrado
en otras &aacute;reas de la pol&#237;tica, ya que la mayor&#237;a de los
programas y proyectos de desarrollo de la antigua RDA implementados
en el marco de su &uacute;ltimo plan quinquenal hab&#237;an finalizado
o bien no sobrevivieron a la disoluci&oacute;n de la RDA. De los
106 proyectos de la ex RDA, el BMZ continu&oacute; 64, despu&eacute;s
de rigurosos an&aacute;lisis. Adem&aacute;s, numerosas personas
de pa&#237;ses en desarrollo becadas por la RDA continuaron recibiendo
apoyo de la Alemania unificada.
<P>
<B>Estructura org&aacute;nica: caracteristicas, ventajas y desventajas</B>
<P>
La estructura de organizaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n
alemana tiene caracter&#237;sticas singulares en comparaci&oacute;n
con la mayor&#237;a de los donantes del CAD. Sus principales caracteristicas,
entre otras, son las siguientes:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Alemania cuenta con un ministerio propio de desarrollo,
encargado de la fijaci&oacute;n de los principios, el financiamiento
y la planificaci&oacute;n pol&#237;tica, los controles, el manejo y
la coordinaci&oacute;n de todas las medidas de cooperaci&oacute;n,
las negociaciones gubernamentales con pa&#237;ses receptores y la coordinaci&oacute;n
con otros donantes.
<P>
<li>La implementaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
ha sido transferida a dos organizaciones centrales paraestatales
(KfW y GTZ), as&#237; como a numerosas organizaciones paraestatales,
semiestatales y privadas.
<P>
<li>La materializaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n financiera
y de la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica ha sido sesgada en t&eacute;rminos
institucionales por razones de orden hist&oacute;rico.
<P>
<li>La representaci&oacute;n exterior de la cooperaci&oacute;n
econ&oacute;mica alemana en los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo es (en parte
debido a las reservas tradicionales del ministerio de RR EE) m&aacute;s
d&eacute;bil que en una serie de otros donantes, los que han delegado
la planificaci&oacute;n, la realizaci&oacute;n y el manejo de
sus proyectos en parte considerable a representaciones que operan
en el terreno de la cooperaci&oacute;n, y s&oacute;lo ha prosperado
en los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os. Dicha representaci&oacute;n
comprende actualmente 26 encargados de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
adscritos a las embajadas, as&#237; como 24 oficinas de administraci&oacute;n
de proyectos y 30 puntos de servicio de la GTZ. La KfW cuenta
s&oacute;lo desde hace poco tiempo con dos encargados locales
de proyectos (en Cairo y en Nueva Delhi).</ul>
<P>
La organizaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
alemana tiene ventajas y desventajas. Entre las ventajas se encuentran:
<P>
<ul>
<li>La existencia de poderosas organizaciones ejecutoras,
como la KfW y la GTZ, situaci&oacute;n que otros pa&#237;ses donantes
- en los cuales la realizaci&oacute;n est&aacute; en manos de las
autoridades de la cooperaci&oacute;n o bien de agencias - no se
da o se da s&oacute;lo en forma limitada. La importancia de las
organizaciones como las alemanas radica en su flexibilidad. La
KfW y la GTZ han acumulado un alto grado de conocimientos regionales
y sectoriales y tienen en este sentido gran prestigio internacional.
<P> 
<li>La estructura organizativa para la realizaci&oacute;n es
diferenciada debido a que en ella participan numerosas organizaciones
no gubernamentales y del sector privado. Pese a los problemas
de coordinaci&oacute;n, esa estructura genera una suerte de pluralismo,
abre posibilidades de especializaci&oacute;n e incrementa la aceptaci&oacute;n
social de la cooperaci&oacute;n. Una particularidad netamente
alemana la constituyen las cinco fundaciones de los partidos pol&#237;ticos.</ul>
<P>
Por otra parte, la organizaci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n
alemana tiene varias desventajas :
<P>
<ul>
<li>La inadecuada divisi&oacute;n del trabajo entre el BMZ,
por un lado, y la KfW y la GTZ, por otro, lo que determina que
la responsabilidad del BMZ comprenda desde la toma de decisiones
vinculada a cuestiones de principios hasta la planificaci&oacute;n
y el manejo pol&#237;tico (en contraposici&oacute;n al del car&aacute;cter
netamente t&eacute;cnico) de cada proyecto. Esto conduce a una
superposici&oacute;n de tareas entre las instituciones y limita
la capacidad del BMZ para realizar trabajos de tipo conceptual.
<P>
<li>La separaci&oacute;n institucional entre la cooperaci&oacute;n
financiera y la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica, que no se conoce
en esos t&eacute;rminos en la mayor&#237;a de los otros pa&#237;ses donantes
y que genera crecientes obst&aacute;culos para orientarse hacia
formas m&aacute;s globales de
ayuda (ayuda a programas, apoyo a programas de ajuste estructural,
capacity building).
<P>
<li>La representaci&oacute;n exterior comparativamente escasa
de la cooperaci&oacute;n alemana en pa&#237;ses en desarrollo, que
ha sido criticada reiteradas veces por el CAD y que obstaculiza
la planificaci&oacute;n y el manejo adecuados de las medidas en
contacto estrecho con los pa&#237;ses beneficiados.</ul>
<P>
<B>Concepci&oacute;n del desarrollo, objetivos superiores e intereses
propios</B>
<P>
Para caracterizar los objetivos perseguidos con la pol&iacute;tica
alemana de desarrollo
es recomendable diferenciar entre la concepci&oacute;n de desarrollo,
los objetivos superiores y los &quot;intereses propios&quot; vinculados
a la cooperaci&oacute;n (objetivos ajenos a la cooperaci&oacute;n
para el desarrollo):
<P>
<I><B>La concepci&oacute;n del desarrollo</B></I>
<P>
El objetivo de la politica alemana de cooperaci&oacute;n de respaldar
el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico y social de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo
a trav&eacute;s de la ayuda al esfuerzo propio y contribuir as&#237;
al mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida se ha mantenido, en
el fondo, desde el comienzo. S&#237; se ha registrado una modificaci&oacute;n
en los conceptos que se persiguen. La cooperaci&oacute;n se ha
ajustado en principio al cambio registrado en las concepciones
internacionales (simplificadamente: fuerte acentuaci&oacute;n
de la infraestructura econ&oacute;mica y, junto a &eacute;sta,
de la educaci&oacute;n en los a&ntilde;os sesenta, satisfacci&oacute;n
de las necesidades b&aacute;sicas en los a&ntilde;os setenta,
ajuste estructural, di&aacute;logo pol&#237;tico, fortalecimiento del
sector privado en los a&ntilde;os ochenta, concentraci&oacute;n
en la lucha contra la pobreza, la defensa del medio ambiente y
la educaci&oacute;n desde comienzos de los a&ntilde;os noventa).
<P>
Con los nuevos criterios empleados por el BMZ a partir de octubre
de 1991 para otorgar la ayuda (derechos humanos, participaci&oacute;n,
seguridad legal, ordenamiento econ&oacute;mico compatible con
el mercado y el aspecto social, acci&oacute;n estatal orientada
al desarrollo), Alemania di&oacute; muestras de impulsar nuevas
iniciativas en el c&#237;rculo de los donantes. El cambio de las concepciones
no siempre condujo en la pr&aacute;ctica de desarrollo a cambios
fundamentales, sino m&aacute;s bien a ajustes graduales.
<P>
<I><B>Objetivos superiores</B></I>
<P>
 Desde la perspectiva de los objetivos superiores, tradicionalmente la pol&#237;tica alemana de
desarrollo se ha considerado a s&#237; misma (como se sostuvo en los
principios de desarrollo of iciales de 1986) parte integrante
de la pol&#237;tica global de paz. Desde el fin del conflicto Este-Oeste,
el motivo del aseguramiento del futuro de la humanidad adquiere
cada vez mayor importancia, y refleja la creciente percepci&oacute;n
de las nuevas amenazas globales (a trav&eacute;s de da&ntilde;os
ambientales, el aumento de la poblaci&oacute;n, las corrientes
internacionales de refugiados o los conflictos regionales o &eacute;tnicos
que generan efectos internacionales).
<P>
<I><B>Intereses propios</B></I>
<P>
La cooperaci&oacute;n alemana para el desarrollo siempre ha sido
parte integrante del conjunto de las relaciones exteriores y -
al subordinarse al igual que cualquier otra &aacute;rea pol&#237;tica
al precepto constitucional de servir al pueblo alem&aacute;n y
no ocasionarle perjuicios - sirve a los intereses alemanes.
<P>
Decisiva resulta la definici&oacute;n de los intereses alemanes.
Estos pueden referirse tanto a objetivos tan fundamentales
como el aseguramiento de la paz y del futuro, como tambi&eacute;n
a intereses de pol&#237;tica exterior, econom&#237;a externa o de pol&#237;tica
interna muy espec&#237;ficos. En el segundo caso pueden surgir conflictos
con la cooperaci&oacute;n en materia de objetivos. De hecho los
propios intereses concretos siempre han ejercido influencia en
la cooperaci&oacute;n alemana, afect&aacute;ndola en parte (ejemplos:
la Doctrina Hallstein, la detenci&oacute;n del avance del comunismo,
el aseguramiento de la exportaci&oacute;n y de materias primas,
efecto de la cooperaci&oacute;n sobre la tasa de empleo, mejoramiento
de la posici&oacute;n competitive de la econom&#237;a alemana en mercados
de exportaci&oacute;n).
<P>
En comparaci&oacute;n con otros donantes, Alemania tiene una posici&oacute;n
intermedia en lo que se refiere a la relaci&oacute;n entre la
pol&#237;tica de desarrollo y los intereses propios: Alemania Federal
nunca ha subordinado la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo a los intereses
exteriores o de seguridad, como EE UU, o a los intereses comerciales
exteriores, como Jap&oacute;n en el pasado, pero tampoco ha buscado
un perfilamiento claro en materia de desarrollo, como lo han hecho
numerosos pa&#237;ses &quot;like-minded&quot; (por ejemplo, algunos
pa&#237;ses escandinavos y Holanda).
<P>
<B>Los partidos pol&#237;ticos, el Parlamento y la opini&oacute;n publica</B>
<P>
En Alemania la pol&iacute;tica de desarrollo goza de un favorable
consenso b&aacute;sico entre los partidos pol&iacute;ticos establecidos,
en el Parlamento y en la opini&oacute;n p&uacute;blica, pese a
las numerosas diferencias (que se resaltan a veces debido a la
necesidad de perfilamiento pol&#237;tico) y a cierto escepticismo frente
a la pr&aacute;ctica de la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo.
Ese consenso b&aacute;sico representa un capital de considerable
valor, aun cuando la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo, por su propia naturaleza,
tenga una importancia de segundo rango en la percepci&oacute;n
p&uacute;blica de los temas vinculados a la pol&#237;tica interna y
la de asuntos econ&oacute;micos.
<P>
La pol&#237;tica de desarrollo es, para el conjunto de los partidos
representados en la C&aacute;mara Baja del Parlamento (Bundestag),
un tema que no se agota en programas partidarios o electorales,
sino que genera a la vez debates y consultas en el Parlamento,
y que tiene efectos en el asesoramiento y la toma de decisiones
del BMZ.
<P>
<B>Desaf&#237;os</B>
<P>
Para realizar un aporte al aseguramiento global del futuro, la
pol&#237;tica de desarrollo alemana necesita:
<P>
<ul>
a) Un incremento de los recursos financieros a mediano plazo.
<P>
b) Mayor influencia pol&iacute;tica en el sentido de la coherencia
de la pol&#237;tica: en las relaciones con los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo
desempe&ntilde;an un paper importante diversas &quot;pol&#237;ticas&quot;
(por ejemplo, &aacute;reas de la pol&#237;tica exterior, la agricultura,
el comercio, las inversiones directas, el endeudamiento, el medio
ambiente, los refugiados), que no pertenecen al &aacute;rea de
responsabilidad de la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo, pero que son tangenciales
a ella y a veces haste la enfrentan. Estas deben ser analizadas
m&aacute;s a fondo en relaci&oacute;n con sus efectos globales
y su compatibilidad con el desarrollo. El gobierno alem&aacute;n
se comprometi&oacute; en el Tratado de Maastricht con el precepto
de la coherencia.
<P>
c) Un mejoramiento sostenido de la efectividad y eficiencia. El
lo no s&oacute;lo se refiere a las condiciones marco en los pa&#237;ses
contrapartes, por importante que sean, sino tambi&eacute;n a la
estructura de la oferta alemana.
<P>
Los puntos de partida (junto a la coherencia de la pol&#237;tica) son:
liberar al BMZ de  la responsabilidad de los proyectos (con  excepci&oacute;n
del control de los logros, que  debiera m&aacute;s bien ser intensificado),
fortalecer su capacidad para el trabajo estrat&eacute;gico (que
sit&uacute;a al BMZ en condiciones de &quot;ocupar&quot; con mayor
&eacute;nfasis el tema del aseguramiento global frente a los otros
ministerios), concentrar la cooperaci&oacute;n en un menor n&uacute;mero
de pa&#237;ses (eventualmente en coordinaci&oacute;n con otros donantes
en la Uni&oacute;n Europea) y en un menor n&uacute;mero de sectores
en los pa&#237;ses contrapartes, llevar permanentemente perfiles detallados
de los pa&#237;ses como importante instrumento para la conducci&oacute;n
de la cooperaci&oacute;n, ligar m&aacute;s estrechamente (hasta
lograr por &uacute;ltimo la fusi&oacute;n) de la cooperaci&oacute;n
financiera con la t&eacute;cnica, as&#237; como fortalecer la representaci&oacute;n
exterior.
<P>
d) Una determinaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s exacta del papel de la
cooperaci&oacute;n en el conjunto de relaciones con los pa&#237;ses
en desarrollo. La pol&#237;tica de desarrollo es parte indiscutible
de las relaciones de cooperaci&oacute;n con pa&#237;ses y regiones
en desarrollo y puede contribuir a configurarla con sus tareas
e instrumentario particulares.</ul>
<P>
La cr&#237;tica que afirma que la pol&#237;tica de desarrollo, que es fundamentalmente
lucha contra la pobreza, s&oacute;lo se siente comprometida con
los pa&#237;ses menos desarrollados (LLDC) y no se ajusta a las necesidades
de cooperaci&oacute;n de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo m&aacute;s avanzados,
desconoce en muchos sentidos las verdaderas necesidades de los
actores. Por una parte, la pobreza es un problema relevante en
numerosos pa&#237;ses en desarrollo ya avanzados. Por otra, es precisamente
la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo la que puede realizar
ofertas de cooperaci&oacute;n (por ejemplo, asesoramiento en
las &aacute;reas de pol&#237;tica social, laboral, educativa, ambiental
o urbana) que pueden tener relevancia para la lucha contra la
pobreza. Un desarrollo social a la vez compatible con el medio
ambiente de los pa&#237;ses beneficiados interesa tambi&eacute;n a
Alemania (incluso en sentido econ&oacute;mico). 
<P>
Si bien el fomento
activo de las exportaciones alemanas es, por el contrario, un
objetivo legitimo, no constituye una tarea propia de la cooperaci&oacute;n,
por lo que en el Parlamento y ante la opini&oacute;n p&uacute;blica
deber&#237;a presentarse claramente como lo que es, una pol&#237;tica diferente
que, en caso de ser necesario, debe contar con recursos financieros
propios.

<title>A Governance Approach to Civil Service Reform</title>
</header>
<hr>
<H3><center><img src="../images/dpmf.jpg">
<p>
A Governance Approach to Civil Service Reform:<br>Notes from a Consultative Meeting,
Maastricht, 27-28 June 1994</h3>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: page 7</i>
</center>
<p>
<hr><p>
Immediately before its 1994 Round Table, ECDPM and the World Bank's Africa Technical
Department organised a meeting
of senior public servants from Ghana, Guinea, Tanzania, and Zambia. They examined the utility
of the 'Governance
Approach to Civil Service Reform' proposed by the World Bank; and reviewed the effectiveness
of Institutional
Environmental Assessment (IEA), as used in the Gambia, in relation to their own reform
programmes.
<p>
Among other things, discussions focused on two essential processes. First, the process by which
external agencies
and host governments consult on the adoption of the governance approach; and second, the
process by which host
governments consult with other actors and stakeholders in promoting the use of the approach.
<p>
<h3>Donor - Government Consultation</h3>

It was stressed that careful sensitisation is needed before adopting the approach. In ongoing
reform initiatives, the
approach may help energise and give new direction to the reform process, but its methodology
cannot be imposed,
especially from the outside. In the process, consultation is used to build ownership, and a sense
of shared conviction
between donor and recipient, rather than a sense of imposed conditions from outside. Ghana's
present reform
programmes were cited as an example of partnership where the donor community - in this case
the World Bank -
provided expertise on techniques and approaches but were kept at 'arms-length.' Ultimately, it
is planned that the
Bank, acting as a facilitator, will gradually work itself out of a job.
Consultation between Governmental Institutions and Stakeholders
<p>
Participants emphasised that consultation between donor and government is not in itself
sufficient to secure
acceptance of a reform process. To build consensus and support, it is essential to ensure
understanding and
acceptance of the approach within the country -- at both political and administrative levels.
<p>
Politicians should be fully sensitised on the nature of the governance approach. This avoids
possible rejection, allays
fears they may have, and allows facilitators to anticipate necessary modifications. It is also
important to ensure that
different parts and levels of the public service are involved in elaborating the approaches to be
used -- since they are
most affected by changes, and most involved in their implementation.
<p>
It was stressed also that the general public needs to be aware of the implications of reform,
especially where
significant retrenchment is likely. Consultation and debate is particularly important where
extended families depend
on family members employed in the public sector.
<p>
Finally, it was considered necessary that reforms are designed within a broader social and
economic context in which
negative outcomes of reform, such as unemployment, can be dealt with.

<P>
<B>The general objective of development cooperation, to provide help
for self help, means for Technical Cooperation (TC) above all improving
the capacity of the partner countries to solve problems. Ways
of further developing the concepts and instruments to be applied
to this end have long been discussed at international and national
levels. The need for a reorientation of TC has in particular become
clear in the deliberations of the OECD's Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) since the end of the 1980s.</B>
<P>
The thrust of the principles developed by the DAC for such a realignment
is clear <a href="#1">(1)</a>. The most important headings are: orientation on the
concept of sustainable development; stronger orientation on the
partners; subsidiarity; forming points of main effort in the areas
of institutional development/strengthening of management capacities
in the public and private sectors/human resources development;
stronger orientation on strategy and programmes instead of individual
projects; emphasis on an effective and efficient use of funds;
and improving coordination among the multiplicity of donors and
aid organisations.
<P>
These guidelines also largely define the framework for a further
conceptional development of German TC. This and the following
article on this crucial problem area will illustrate how important
 but also how difficult  it is to take the route recommended by
the DAC. Upfront is one question: to what extent is the call for
a stronger orientation on strategy and programmes  thus a TC aligned
on broad impacts or significance  compatible with the demand for
a TC that is also sustainably effective.
<P>
<B>Sustainability in development cooperation</B>
<P>
The professional development policy debate of recent years has
above all paid great attention to the criterion of sustain&quot;ability. This has been related not only to the development process
as a whole, but also to project oriented cooperation. With regard
to the project level, one can see that the results of the discussions
have been used above all, and rightly so, to further define the
requirements for effective project planning and implementation.
<P>
Monitoring of impacts over many years has in particular shown
that TC projects up to their handover have a chance to achieve
their targets and have sustainable impacts precisely if:
<P>
<ul>
<li>the general political, legal, economic, sociocultural and
institutional framework conditions which impact on the project
are favourable, or that the project  within the bounds of necessity
 can influence them;
<li>the project is placed with an executing agency which is
either already motivated and efficient, or can be sufficiently
strengthened by the project; here it is of crucial importance
to achieve a partnership cooperation, involving a step-by-step transfer
of responsibility to the project executing agency;
<li>the target group is tied in closely to the project in both
the planning and implementation phases;
<li>the resources available to the project are realistic in
terms of its target;
<li>a realistic, i.e. not too short, time horizon is foreseen
for implementing the project;
<li>the qualifications of the German and local project staff
are up to the task.</ul>
<P>
The intensive discussion on sustainability has above all made
clear that in the final analysis sustainable project impacts
are achievable if an effective project planing and implementation
is ensured.
<P>
<B>Different concepts of sustainability</B>
<P>
There is, however, in no way unanimity on the definition of sustainability.
Thus, a cross section analysis by the Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development on the sustainability of TC projects
discusses three different concepts of it:
<P>
<ul>
<li>sustainability exists when the targeted project impacts
remain robust for the target group after the project has been handed
over to them;
<li>sustainability is not determined by what is preserved from the
project but by what the project gets under way;
<li>sustainability can also be achieved when, first, horizontal
spill overs from the project occur in neighbouring regions/sectors,
or, secondly, the project idea or approach takes root at a higher
decision level as the basis or part of national standards or national
policies and thus assumes the role of a model.</ul>
<P>
Under the conditions of a rapidly changing project environment,
the first definition is in many cases too narrow. Just as during
a project's life cycle its goal and targeted output must often
be adjusted to a changed environment, this is also mostly required
after the end of the project. Therefore it is precisely those
projects that have enabled the executing agency independently
to adapt the project conception to changing framework conditions
which should be rated as sustainable.
<P>
The gist of the third definition addresses the broad impact of
projects, and is therefore too wide. Even projects with modest
objectives and small impacts, but which the executing agency can
continue or develop further on its own bat, are to be identified
as sustainable. The two dimensions of sustainability and broad
impact should therefore be analytically carefully held apart,
and sustainability understood in the sense of the first two definitions.
<P>
<B>Neglected criterion of significance</B>
<P>
In view of the developmental stimulus, however, it is not sufficient
to ensure that a project will be implemented effectively and sustainable
impacts are achieved. Indeed, the decisive question is not whether
a project makes some contribution to solving one of many problems.
Rather, it is about to what extent a project, or a bundle of projects,
makes a significant contribution to solving a problem that in
the context of a specific development strategy is recognised as
particularly urgent. The question of significance thus asks to
what extent project successes are converted into palpable development
stimuli and successes. This is the case when a project:
<P>
<ul>
<li>has broad impact, e.g. it triggers tangible stimuli in
a sectoral or regional context;
<li>or contributes to structure building, e.g. it supports important structural reforms or deepens interlinkage
between institutions or government and nongovernment actors;
<li>or has a model character, i.e. it can be replicated in
other sectors or regions.</ul>
<P>
Of the total of 26 projects we included in a series evaluation,
only a few met one of these requirements. In other words, the
criterion of  &quot;significance&quot; was hardly explicitly made
an agenda, although we tried to consider only such projects whose
conception suggested they had potential for significance.
<P>
<B>Demands on significant projects</B>
<P>
Projects planned to develop significant impacts, however, make
particularly high demands on the process of project identification,
planning and implementation.
<P>
First, particularly in countries with a low development level,
one cannot as a rule presume that they have sufficiently favourable
framework conditions. Rather, these must be co designed by the
projects.
<P>
Secondly, in projects with sectoral and/or regional broad impacts
or model character, an efficient executing agency or a strong
executing organisation structure must often be built up first.
<P>
Thirdly, it is not sufficient to optimise the internal structure
of a project; rather, this must be purposefully and actively embedded
in the sectoral and/or regional context.
<P>
Next, orientation on significant projects requires every time
more intensive cooperation between the recipient and donor countries,
as well as better harmonisation among the donors. The latter is
above all necessary so that development cooperation makes a sustainable
and significant contribution to strengthening the capability of
the national actors in the partner countries to draw up strategies.
<P>
Finally, the demands on project planning and the project management
generally grow in line with the increasing complexity of a project.
<P>
<B>Sustainability versus significance?</B>
<P>
In the most extreme case it is possible to achieve sustainable
project impacts (e.g. an installation in a permanently functionable
university laboratory), without contributing significantly to
solving the real problem (e.g. covering the most urgent research
needs of the most important target group, putting in place close
interaction between R&amp;D and application).
<P>
Thus, &quot;project islands&quot; not interlinked with their environment
can definitely be sustainable. Evaluations of sustainability in
agricultural projects found, in fact, that &quot;projects with
high sustainability were almost exclusively monocausal ones: the
more modest they were, the greater impact they had&quot;.
<P>
The same goes for the trend that, particularly in a turbulent
and inefficient environment, sustainability is easier to achieve
in projects with marginal impacts than in those aimed at significance,
or influencing and changing the environment.
<P>
The following conclusions arise from these considerations:
<P>

<ul>
<li>Sustainability and significance will often have a tense
relationship. On the one hand, sustainability is the prerequisite
for significant project impacts. A project that founders cannot
be significant. On the other hand, sustainability is apparently
easier to achieve in less complex, more modest projects than in
those targeted on significance. If the sustainability of TC projects
is to be seen as the most important criterion of success, demanding
and thereby risky  projects will be more likely to be passed up.
The effect of that would be that sustainable projects would contribute
only marginally to solving social and economic development problems.
Thus, in developmental terms, it does not make sense to resolve
the tension between significance and sustainability by rejecting
demanding projects;
<li>The criteria significance and sustainability relate to
very different dimensions of the developmental effectiveness of
projects. Accordingly, both criteria must every time be explicitly
considered in the project cycle.</ul>
<P>
<B>Resolving the tension zone</B>
<P>
In view of the relevance of both significance and sustainability
for development cooperation planning practice, it is important
to come to a balanced relationship between them. That presupposes
in particular that the greater risks linked with more complex
projects can be effectively limited and controlled.
<P>
Limiting the sustainability risk requires on the one hand attention
criteria which today are seen as essential for effective and efficient
project planning and implementation (see above). Further important
 starting points, in order to reduce the  risks of failure of
significant projects, are  above all the purposeful use of  orientation
phases and an  unambiguous establishment of key  areas of bilateral
TC.
<P>
Given the prerequisites identified  above, the tension inherent
in a TC  focused on both significance and  sustainability appears
to be largely  manageable. In this respect, it is time for  the
criterion of significance to be seen as  equally crucial in project
selection as  effectiveness and sustainability.  Specifically,
this means:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Orientation on significance at  individual project level: Seen
from the  developing country, the main problem is  not to acquire
as many effective  development projects as possible.  Rather,
it is about how individual project  successes can be transformed
into  tangible &quot;systemic&quot; development  successes. This
question particularly  applies to the few developing countries
 in which there is no lack of effective  projects of the international
donor  community. Nevertheless, the  developmental contribution
of the  manifold project activities is limited, and  in fact above
all because the projects  often integrate into their environment
only  very insufficiently. Therefore the more  relevant developmental
question of a  project's possible contribution to  structure building
in an important area  must be moved front and centre. The still
 frequent practice of overemphasising  the internal perspectives
of  often small   projects must be overcome.
<P>
<li>System promotion: The ultimate  answer to ensuring significance
in an  inefficient but important sector would be  to abandon point for point
approaches in  favour of promoting a  programme related structural
reform of  broad TC impact. A system promotion  which built on
harmonised promotional  instruments would be conceivable. As far
 as possible at the same time, the  following should be targeted:
<P>
<ul>
<li>
horizontal interlinkage of individual projects;
<li>vertical interlinkage of projects at different levels,
e.g. of projects to promote  institution building with consultancy
 measures at the system level.</ul>
<P>
The objective of implementing  structure building projects that
are as  significant as possible and purposefully  integrated in
their environment leads to  the question of how, beyond the  classical
promotion of an executing  agency, other local institutions or,
in fact,  executing organisation structures can be  strengthened.
Such attempts to enhance  the capability for social self organisation
 are demanding. In the light of the initial situation, which as
a rule is  characterised by a low efficiency of the  relevant
intermediary government and  private institutions and weak interaction
 between them, such projects are above  all successful if:
<P>
<ul>
<li>a realistic specification of costs and  quantities is taken
as a basis, and, if  necessary, TC and Financial  Cooperation
(FC) are combined;
<li>a sufficient time horizon is planned;
<li>and, as far as possible, a continuous  and spreading transfer
of knowhow  from Germany is organised, s&ugrave;ch as  by the
promotion of partnerships,  cooperation agreements between  important
institutions or scholarship  programmes.</ul>
<P>
When such projects are successful  they can make an important
contribution  to increasing problem solving capacities  in a sector
or region. Projects which are  to carry out moderating and interlinkage
 functions, without enough efficient actors  already on hand,
are less successful.  Projects aligned on interlinkage  presuppose
more or less stable  framework conditions in the respective  sector
and require actors capable of  drawing up strategies.
<P>
Bad experiences in cooperation with  less efficient government
institutions led  recently to a reorientation in selecting  project
executing agencies. Preference  is now given to working with NGOs.
 However, hopes of being able to  substitute weak government institutions
 by mobilising social actors overlook the  fact that durable development
remains  dependent upon both, as well as the  building up of stable
framework  conditions. Projects aiming at  significance should
take account of this  correlation.
<P>
<li>Setting of key areas: These  considerations suggest a clear
setting of  key areas for German TC. Only a  long term commitment
in, say, two or  three policy fields or sectors instead of  scattering
project activities over many  sectors:
<P>
<ul>
<li>enables the accumulation of sectoral  knowhow on the German
side which  facilitates the embedding of individual  measures
in the project environment;
<li>permits the supplementing and  combining of different instruments
and  thereby the creation of synergy effects;
<li>contributes through continuous  cooperation with the recipient
side to  strengthening national actors'  capacities to draw up
strategies;
<li>strengthens the know-how and donor  profile of the German
side, and allows  the elaboration of project modules  which can
be replicated in other  countries;
<li>facilitates coordination of donors;
<li>reduces administrative effort on the  German side;
<li>enhances transparency on the recipient side.</ul>
<P>
<li>Development of a pronounced  German offer profile: The required
 establishment of key areas should  consciously be carried out
mainly in  fields in which, compared with other  donors, the German
side has special  strengths in offers, i.e. &quot;comparative
ad  advantages&quot;. These include in particular  those areas in
which exemplary  structure have been created in  Germany, so that
by international  comparison German policies,  institutions, instruments
and human re  sources exhibit special efficiency. That  applies
to such important fields as dual  vocational training, MSTQ (metrology,
 standardisation, testing and quality  assurance environmental
technology  and policies, industry related R&amp;D and  use of
productive forms of cooperation  between the government, the private
 sector and social group (public-private  partnership) within the
framework of  economic policies which are oriented  on dialogue.
<P>
Of course, the policies and institutions developed for our specific
conditions  over many years cannot simply be  transferred to developing
countries.  Rather, a more significant contribution to  structure building in the partner-countries is only to be expected when  the
problem-solving capacity that we  have developed is adapted to
prevailing  initial situations and developed further  by continuous
and growing own efforts.</ol>
<P>
<B>Summing up and outlook</B>
<P>
The intensive discussion on  sustainability in recent years has
brought  important clarifications of the question of  the conditions
for success and risk  factors for effective development  cooperation
at project level. In particular,  it has sharpened the focus on
the  demands on effective project  implementation. A similarly
intensive  debate must also be held in future on the  criterion
of significance. In particular,  thought should be given to the
 possibilities of contributing to the  development of sound strategies
and  policies at sectoral, regional or national  level through
a strategy-related and  programme-oriented employment of TC  (and
possibly FC) in the partner-countries.

<ul><center><h1>The razor's end</h1>

<p>

<font size=+1><i>Have the old women had their way?...<br>
The Chief's revelation... <br>
National campaigns snowball...<br>
The hands that made 
the cut...</i></font>

<p>

<font size=-1>Left: 'For my health I refuse excision.'<br> This product of a strong government campaign<br> is one of many impressive health-education posters<br> to be found on the walls of Sabtenga's clinic.</font>
</center></ul><hr width=80%>
<br clear=left><p>
<font size=+2>O</font>f all the issues that perturbed me as I returned to the village this time, the one that worried me most of all was female genital mutilation - the traditional practice in some African societies of removing a girl's clitoris in preparation for womanhood and marriage. I was also well aware that this is a subject with a rare power to fascinate Western readers by its sheer horror. In a magazine built on the idea of connecting people across the cultural and economic Grand Canyon how was I to handle this most alienating of issues? 
<p>
There is something of a voyeuristic, negative element to this preoccupation of 'enlightened', anti-sexist Westerners with clitoral excision. Somehow, debarred from all the other reactionary notions about African savagery, our morbid fascination and 'politically correct' moral outrage becomes all the more extreme. Some campaigners have reacted to this by launching a defence of the practice as a part of indigenous African tradition over which Westernization is riding roughshod. 
<p>
Let's try to dispense with morbid fascination but also agree that excision itself is indefensible - it not only deprives women of sexual pleasure but causes them all kinds of pain and health complications. Girls regularly end up disabled and even dead as a result of the 'operation' or infections caused by it.
<p>
But my worries, as I returned to the village, were much more concrete. Mariama was the first woman in the village to stand up against the traditional practice and refused to have her daughters mutilated. Ten years ago her two daughters Memnatu and Aseta were still unharmed but I was by no means confident that they would have remained so. There have been plenty of documented cases where the older women of a village (who are generally responsible for the act) have taken matters into their own hands and used a razor on a girl. In 1993, for example, Ouagadougou teacher Isabelle Ilboudo sent her five-year-old daughter Vanessa on holiday to her family village - only for Vanessa to be sent back to the capital excised by outraged aunts.
<p>

<p>
<font size=-1>One of the saved.  Aseta's fourth journey to the pump this afternoon ends in a shimmering curtain of water.  <a href="268_coca.html">The scar by her nose tells a tale...</a></font>
<p>

Even if the old women had not intervened, I wondered if Mariama's eldest daughter Memnatu, who would now be of marriageable age, might have been forced to capitulate to the tradition in order to find a marriage partner. In some parts of Burkina Faso excision actually doesn't happen until the wedding day itself, when the bride is cut in the bush, honoured in a ceremony and then returns to her husband to consummate the marriage.
<p>
So it is with great relief that I find neither Memnatu nor her sister Aseta have been mutilated. But it isn't until I interview the traditional Chief of the village that I discover what a revolution has occurred here these past ten years. I ask the Chief about his attitude to excision fully expecting him, as official guardian of tradition in the community, to be gung-ho for it, as everyone was in 1985. 	
<p>
Instead he gives a remarkable answer. Up until seven years ago, he says, he thought this a good thing. But after hearing government campaigns on the radio and listening to the case made by local women like Mariama, he came round to thinking it an unhealthy practice which causes women pain and danger in childbirth. Since then he has not only stopped it happening to his own youngest daughters but has also held two public meetings to campaign against it.
<p>
I can hardly believe my ears. I naturally came to the village in hope of finding success stories that might lighten people's general gloom at the African condition. But never in my wildest dreams did I expect such a transformation as this. As Mariama and I retreat from the Chief's concession I ask her if this is really true.
<p>
'Yes, it's true,' she says. 'Excision doesn't happen here any more.'
<p>
But that's wonderful, I burble, telling her how proud of herself she should be. And so she should - as the first woman to stand against the tide she can take a great deal of credit for the change. 
<p>
Of course the Chief could have been just telling me what I wanted to hear - as he certainly did on another issue (see Page 16). But over my weeks in the village the revolution in attitude is confirmed. There seems to be nothing taboo about the subject: everyone agrees excision no longer happens. When I ask a lively women's meeting about the issue, for example, one woman pipes up 'If I tried to do it to my daughter now she'd have me put in prison!'
<p>

<p>


As this indicates the change has not come about entirely through grassroots pressure from below. It is also a response to national education campaigns which have their roots in Sankara's Revolution. Sankara was the first of the country's leaders to take a stand against genital mutilation, calling the campaign 'a just and noble struggle' which aimed to emancipate women. In 1985, just before my first visit to the country, activists called for the abolition of excision during National Women's Week. This led directly to a national seminar in 1988 and ultimately to the production of a TV documentary with the World Health Organization called Ma fille ne sera pas excisee (My daughter will not be excised). The National Anti-Excision Committee was launched formally in 1990 by President Compaore, and this runs 
regular awareness meetings as well as producing TV and radio broadcasts. 
<p>
The unanimity with which the practice is now condemned in the village is quite staggering - I almost want to find someone who disagrees to prove I am not the victim of some huge whitewash. I find it in the person of the old Imam, Umaru Tanaguda, who doggedly sticks to his position that neither woman nor man can be a Muslim unless they have been circumcised - it is for him a question of purification. But even the most devout members of his community have now moved beyond him and accepted that there is no connection between Islamic faith and female excision - the practice was never advocated in the Qur'an. Adama, for example, the husband in our film ten years ago, is himself a marabou, a kind of lay preacher, who teaches Islamic law in his own home. Yet he too has abandoned the practice so that Rasmatu, who was born while I was here ten years ago, has escaped mutilation.
<p>
If there are still excisions going on in the village then they happen clandestinely. In the nearby town, Garango, I meet a nurse who says that he does still encounter excision - but in only about ten per cent of girls. This is still too high, of course, but it is a pretty remarkable shift from the near 100 per cent of ten years ago. And perhaps the most telling thing of all is that the excisions are now happening in secret. Ten years ago the shame and stigma was on those who still had what was seen as 'the female penis' and who were thus not real women. The reversal is extraordinary.
<p>
I am determined to meet one of the old women who used to carry out the operation to see if she has accepted the new orthodoxy. Coca Maloni, who is profiled below, performed excisions up until three years ago - a chilling thought given the state of the enfeebled, shaking hands which held the razor blade so recently. Even more terrifyingly, she says she had always believed that the clitoris was a worm that would burrow back inside the girl and do internal damage if it were not cut out. But three years ago she'd been persuaded that it was a bad and unnecessary practice - she mentions official radio campaigns as a key factor in convincing her and the other old women that they should stop. We can lament the ignorance that governed her practice of excision over all those years - but we should also appreciate the humility with which she has accepted, at the very end of her life, that she has been mistaken.
<p>
Almost everyone I talk to in the village is against excision on health grounds rather than on those of sexual pleasure - and this is undoubtedly the right tack to have won the support of traditional religious and community leaders. But the sexual benefits for all concerned will also be enormous. Sexual intercourse is often very painful for excised women not just because of scarred tissue but also because the removal of the clitoris (and often the labia minora too) means that the vagina is not lubricated by arousal. Some women do report experiencing pleasure when the scar of their clitoris is touched but in practice the experience of sex is inevitably one of endurance for women. This is by no means an advantage for the man - though excision probably originated out of the need for husbands to be sure of their wives' fidelity. Burkinabe men who experience sex with an unexcised woman soon realize that her pleasure and active participation gives them much more enjoyment as well.
<p>
The idea that sexual pleasure will now be possible for all these girls and young women who would have been denied it before is fantastic. It shouldn't be underestimated in itself as a force that will propel this generation of women towards greater equality with their menfolk. Nothing changes in Africa? Don't you believe it!

<H3>Le s&eacute;minaire sur la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e : Le r&ocirc;le des ONG dans la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e: d'un s&eacute;minaire &agrave; un bulletin d'information</H3>
<i>par Debjani Das</i>
<p></CENTER><HR>
<p>
<I>Plus de soixante participants repr&eacute;sentant 54 ONG de 17 pays se sont 
rassembl&eacute;s pendant deux jours les 6 &amp; 7 
d&eacute;cembre 1996, pour discuter entre eux et avec les membres de l'Unit&eacute; Coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e de la Commission europ&eacute;enne du r&ocirc;le que jouent les ONG europ&eacute;ennes pour renforcer leurs partenaires au Sud dans la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e de l'Union europ&eacute;enne. Le document ci-dessous est un premier aper&ccedil;u de ses conclusions principales, tir&eacute; des rapports r&eacute;dig&eacute;s pendant le s&eacute;minaire. Un rapport plus complet du s&eacute;minaire et les documents qui s'y rapportent 
peuvent &ecirc;tre obtenus sur demande.</I>
<p>
<h3>Les raisons pour lesquelles la CE coop&egrave;re avec les ONG</h3>
<ul>
<li>La coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e 
signifie-t-elle la m&ecirc;me chose pour ses divers 
partisans?
<li>A quoi devrait-elle parvenir?
<li> Quelles sont les questions essentielles et les dilemmes suscit&eacute;s par les 
pratiques actuelles et les tendances r&eacute;centes?
</ul>
<p>
Lors de la s&eacute;ance pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re 
d'ouverture, consacr&eacute;e &agrave; pr&eacute;ciser le concept 
de coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e de l'UE, 
Monsieur Bernard Ryelandt (Chef de l'Unit&eacute; Coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e (DG VIII) de la Commission europ&eacute;enne), a 
rappel&eacute; les raisons qu'avait la Commission 
de signer un contrat avec le Comit&eacute; de Liaison sur la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e: 
il s'agit de mobiliser les ONG pour d&eacute;terminer les possibilit&eacute;s d'appui 
aux partenaires dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement, d'identifier les 
conditions politiques et les possibilit&eacute;s pratiques d'intervention des ONG et 
de diffuser des proc&eacute;dures concr&egrave;tes 
sur base d'exp&eacute;riences en cours.
<P>
M. Ryelandt a d&eacute;crit quelques cas typiques de coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e. 
Il en a mentionn&eacute; les sources de financement. Cependant, il a insist&eacute; 
sur le fait que la coop&eacute;ration 
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e ne devait pas &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme 
un instrument financier, mais comme une &#171;nouvelle approche du 
d&eacute;veloppement&#187;, dont l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment central &eacute;tait la 
d&eacute;mocratie &agrave; la base par le biais d'un 
dialogue politique et concret entre les agents d&eacute;centralis&eacute;s et les gouvernements.

<h3>Questions soulev&eacute;es par les ONG du Sud</h3>

Les intervenants repr&eacute;sentant les ONG du Sud (George Huggins, 
Nancy Kachingwe, F. Stephen) ont bien accueilli cette nouvelle orientation de 
la coop&eacute;ration de l'UE vers la 
d&eacute;mocratie et la participation de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile 
dans le dialogue politique. Cependant ils ont mis en lumi&egrave;re les questions sensibles 
et les dilemmes relatifs &agrave; la mise en 
oeuvre. Le changement des relations Etat-ONG (passage d'une &#171;hostilit&eacute;&#187; initiale &agrave; une coop&eacute;ration critique sur une base plus m&ucirc;re via une &#171;lune de miel&#187;) t&eacute;moigne du caract&egrave;re &eacute;volutif des ONG du 
Sud vers plus de professionnalisme dans la fourniture de services, d&eacute;passant 
ainsi leur r&ocirc;le activiste initial. On assiste 
aussi &agrave; une meilleure structuration des 
organisations communautaires, r&eacute;sultant souvent des efforts ant&eacute;rieurs des 
ONG. Huggins a encha&icirc;n&eacute; sur le contexte 
des Cara&iuml;bes. Le &#171;v&eacute;ritable succ&egrave;s&#187; de 
la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e d&eacute;pendra 
de &#171;trois interactions&#187;: la capacit&eacute; des 
ONG en mati&egrave;re de prestation de services, 
la volont&eacute; &eacute;tatique d'offrir un 
v&eacute;ritable espace &agrave; la participation des ONG et 
la capacit&eacute; de l'Union europ&eacute;enne &agrave; 
diffuser l'information sur les opportunit&eacute;s et les ressources, ainsi qu'&agrave; coop&eacute;rer 
au niveau local avec les ONG et les gouvernements.
<ul>
<li>Comment reconvertir les bureaucrates &agrave; de nouveaux syst&egrave;mes de 
gestion conformes aux principes de la participation?
<li> Comment d&eacute;velopper de nouvelles interfaces entre les acteurs de la 
soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, l'Etat et l'aide internationale 
pour veiller &agrave; ce que le d&eacute;veloppement 
soit &quot;participatif&quot; et &quot;durable&quot;?
<li> A quel niveau situer ces interfaces, comment identifier et impliquer 
les acteurs de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e repr&eacute;sentant la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, aux diff&eacute;rents niveaux, dans un contexte d'ordres du jour contradictoires et d'&eacute;quilibres des forces in&eacute;gaux? (La Commission utilise le terme &#171;interface&#187;<I> pour les </I>structures coordonn&eacute;es ou plates-formes au sein desquelles l'ensemble des acteurs d&eacute;centralis&eacute;s 
sont repr&eacute;sent&eacute;s. L'existence de cette interface est une condition essentielle 
pour mettre en place un syst&egrave;me de coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e 
-- voir manuel de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e du CL, page 28).
<li> &quot;Comment respecter les identit&eacute;s 
et partager le pouvoir sans essayer de convertir par la s&eacute;duction 
ou l'intimidation, la cooptation ou le vol?&quot; (P. Stephen)</I>
</ul>
<p>
Ces questions soulev&eacute;es au d&eacute;but 
du s&eacute;minaire ont soulign&eacute; la 
complexit&eacute; qu'il y a &agrave; mettre en pratique une 
th&eacute;orie louable. Les participants se sont 
efforc&eacute;s de situer ces questions dans le 
contexte politique international de 
l'&#187;exclusion globalis&eacute;e au Nord et au Sud&#187; (P. 
Tilus) et de l'affaiblissement des gouvernements du Sud r&eacute;sultant 
de l'ajustement structurel, ainsi que dans le cadre de leurs sp&eacute;cificit&eacute;s locales 
et r&eacute;gionales.
<P>
Le s&eacute;minaire a &eacute;t&eacute; une premi&egrave;re 
&eacute;tape vers l'&eacute;laboration de r&eacute;ponses 
coh&eacute;rentes &agrave; ces d&eacute;fis.
<P>
<h3>Ateliers: &#171;mod&egrave;les&#187; de coop&eacute;ration 
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e de l'UE sous la Convention de Lom&eacute;</h3>

Au cours d'ateliers portant sur des 
&eacute;tudes de cas (exp&eacute;riences au Zimbabwe, 
au S&eacute;n&eacute;gal, en Ha&iuml;ti et dans d'autres 
pays) et gr&acirc;ce aux contributions des 
personnes ressources du Sud et des ONG de l'UE, les participants se sont inform&eacute;s 
de l'avancement du d&eacute;bat sur la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e dans des 
contextes sp&eacute;cifiques. Ils ont acquis une compr&eacute;hension des 
probl&egrave;mes principaux qui se posent aux ONG, 
des m&eacute;canismes pratiques dans la pr&eacute;paration et la mise en place 
d'un syst&egrave;me de coop&eacute;ration 
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, des choix effectu&eacute;s et du r&ocirc;le 
de l'&#187;interface&#187;.
<P>
Les ateliers ont apport&eacute; un fonds d'informations pratiques sur 
le fonctionnement de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e dans des 
contextes sp&eacute;cifiques. Ils ont ainsi permis une 
discussion &eacute;clair&eacute;e sur les potentiels et 
les contraintes de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e comme approche de 
l'UE en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement 
local participatif. Ils ont pos&eacute; les bases de 
discussion pour la s&eacute;ance pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re en ce 
qui concerne les probl&egrave;mes rencontr&eacute;s par 
les ONG du Sud, ainsi que les cons&eacute;quences pour les ONG de l'UE en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et 
pour le projet du Comit&eacute; de Liaison sur la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e en particulier.
<h3>R&ocirc;le des ONG de l'UE</h3>

Le r&ocirc;le des ONG de l'UE en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral 
et le projet du Comit&eacute; de Liaison en particulier ont &eacute;t&eacute; discut&eacute;s dans 
les domaines suivants:
<P>
L'&eacute;change des connaissances, la compr&eacute;hension et les pratiques de 
la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e dans 
une &#171;optique ONG&#187;, le lobbying et le plaidoyer pour faciliter le dialogue. 
La valeur ajout&eacute;e sp&eacute;cifique des ONG 
de l'UE en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et le projet de coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e du Comit&eacute; 
de Liaison en particulier sera de compl&eacute;ter par un autre type d'information 
les sources officielles et de communiquer les r&eacute;sultats de la discussion entre le 
Comit&eacute; de Liaison et la Commission 
europ&eacute;enne aux acteurs de la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e au Sud.
<P>
Renforcement de la capacit&eacute; du personnel de la Commission, des gouvernements et des ONG du Sud. Si la formation des acteurs officiels &agrave; la prise en compte des questions de 
genre et de centralisation a &eacute;t&eacute; 
consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme capitale pour la r&eacute;ussite de 
la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, on 
pourrait soutenir qu'elle devrait &ecirc;tre entreprise 
par la Commission et non par le Comit&eacute; de Liaison.
<P>
D'autre part, le renforcement de la capacit&eacute; au Sud devrait, lorsque 
possible, &ecirc;tre confi&eacute; aux organisations 
locales d'appui. Les ONG de l'UE pourraient jouer 
un r&ocirc;le de liaison, c'est-&agrave;-dire regrouper les ONG du Sud 
lorsqu'elles s'adressent &agrave; la Commission 
europ&eacute;enne afin d'assurer la repr&eacute;sentativit&eacute; 
de l'interface de la coop&eacute;ration 
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e et sa responsabilit&eacute; vis-&agrave;-vis de la 
soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile.
<P>
Mettre en place des syst&egrave;mes de suivi et d'&eacute;valuation et d&eacute;velopper 
des indicateurs pour la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e: ici l'accent a &eacute;t&eacute; mis sur  le fait de corr&eacute;ler les exp&eacute;riences 
des ONG en mati&egrave;re de &#171;d&eacute;veloppement participatif&#187;, de 
&#171;renforcement institutionnel&#187;, de &#171;coop&eacute;ration 
ONG-Etat&#187; et de &#171;partenariat&#187; &agrave; la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e de l'Union europ&eacute;enne.
<P>
Malgr&eacute; la responsabilit&eacute; premi&egrave;re 
du Comit&eacute; de Liaison vis-&agrave;-vis des ONG membres du r&eacute;seau, la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; 
d'une approche plurivalente &eacute;tablissant des ponts vers d'autres acteurs de la 
soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile organis&eacute;e a &eacute;t&eacute; soulign&eacute;e.
<P>
Parmi la pl&eacute;thore des suggestions concernant le r&ocirc;le des ONG de l'UE 
pour renforcer leurs partenaires au Sud dans le domaine de la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, il y a &eacute;galement eu 
une prise en compte de la menace que constitue le concept de 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e pour les ONG de 
l'UE, habitu&eacute;es &agrave; travailler sur une 
base bilat&eacute;rale avec leurs partenaires du 
Sud. Sur la d&eacute;fensive, les ONG de l'UE pouvaient trouver refuge dans des 
abstractions qui ne touchaient pas &agrave; leur travail quotidien. D'o&ugrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; 
d'une clart&eacute; et d'une cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; dans 
la conceptualisation et la mise en oeuvre de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e.
<P>
<h3>Le bulletin d'information sur la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e: 
un m&eacute;canisme pour diffuser l'information et encourager 
le dialogue; </h3>

Certains des besoins comme l'organisation d'un s&eacute;minaire au Sud 
sur la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, la mise 
en place de centres de ressources sur la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e et 
le renforcement de la capacit&eacute; des acteurs institutionnels ne peuvent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;alistement entrepris par le projet actuel du Comit&eacute; de Liaison sur la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e. Au cours de 
l'ann&eacute;e prochaine, le projet pourra 
cependant organiser des contributions de la part 
des ONG de l'UE lorsque n&eacute;cessaire, pour des s&eacute;minaires organis&eacute;s au Sud par 
des ONG du Sud et d'autres organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile. Le s&eacute;minaire 
a constitu&eacute; une &eacute;tape importante 
pour mettre en commun ces ressources.
<P>
L'un des m&eacute;canismes principaux dont dispose le projet du CL sur la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e est un 
bulletin d'information destin&eacute; essentiellement 
au Sud, afin de favoriser le dialogue et le partage d'exp&eacute;riences entre les 
acteurs institutionnels que les ONG du Sud et de l'UE consid&egrave;rent comme 
essentiels pour r&eacute;aliser la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e. Ce bulletin 
d'information d&eacute;marrera au mois de mars. Il est 
pr&eacute;vu de faire para&icirc;tre six num&eacute;ros trimestriels.
<P>
<h3>Dans quelle mesure un bulletin d'information peut-il 
faire office de centre de ressources sur la 
coop&eacute;ra-tion d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e?</h3>

La r&eacute;ussite du bulletin d'information du Comit&eacute; de Liaison en tant que source 
alternative d'informations, de discussion politique et d'&eacute;change 
d'exp&eacute;riences dans le domaine de la 
coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e par les ONG du Sud 
et l'UE, avec un large soutien dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, 
d&eacute;pendra consid&eacute;rablement de l'engagement 
des 800 ONG des quinze plates-formes du Comit&eacute; de Liaison. Il 
conviendra d'identifier les ONG du Sud et les 
autres partenaires &agrave; qui le bulletin 
d'information devrait &ecirc;tre envoy&eacute; en premier lieu, 
en vue de recueillir leurs r&eacute;actions ainsi 
qu'&agrave; des fins d'&eacute;valuation et 
d'information.

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID has been working in Kenya since 1974. Projects in six development areas are now reaching
more than 330,000 people. The principal goal of all these projects is to eradicate poverty by working
directly and in partnership with some of Kenya's poorest and most deprived people.

<p>The focus of much of ACTIONAID's work in Kenya is on helping poor communities to organise
themselves so they can develop and manage initiatives to improve their own lives. Specific support is
provided in savings and credit schemes, developing income generating skills,  improving access to
drinking
water, formal and non-formal  education and preventative health care. 

<p><b>In Kenya, ACTIONAID has:</b>

<p><ul><li> helped more than 53,000 people in the development area of Kyuso gain access to clean,
safe
water.

<p><li>established savings and credit groups in rural Ikanga so that farmers can take loans to buy
ploughs
and oxen, needed to increase agricultural productivity.

<p><li>worked with displaced and local communities in Kapsokwony, following tribal clashes in the
region,
facilitating reconciliation between groups and helping families rebuild their homes.

<p><li>created a network of community-based health workers in the slum district of Kariobangi,
Nairobi,
providing services such as immunisation, growth monitoring, family planning and treatments for
diarrhoea.

<p><li>supported local organisations such as the Nairobi based Know AIDS Society who provide
counselling
and public information on HIV/AIDS.

<P>
Parallel to the widespread decrease of aid resources provided
by donor countries to developing countries in recent years, debate
and research on how to make aid more effective has become a major
concern of policy makers and donor aid administrators. Usually,
it is suggested that decades of development assistance have at
best produced marginal results in terms of improving development
levels in the South. Little mention is made of donors' policy
shortcomings and the negative impact of these on efforts aimed
at reforming and redefining development cooperation in order to
enhance aid effectiveness. The policy parameters and operating
frameworks of existing aid policies continue to inhibit higher
degrees of aid effectiveness. In many donor countries opinion
polls indicate waning public support for development aid.
<P>
Increasingly, the moral case for aid is called into question and
deeper world market integration tends to be seen as the panacea
to continued economic decline and social destabilisation in the
South. Against this background, cooperation between donor and
recipient actors is faced with a dual uphill struggle. First,
fewer resources can be mobilised to meet growing developmental
needs. On the other hand, to organise and manage development policies
and programmes in a results oriented manner, grows more difficult.
The threat of further aid cuts and of further drops of public
support for providing aid become ever more real. A closer look
at the organisational complexities and political constraints under
which development cooperation is expected to perform effectively
may help to improve current aid management approaches.
<P>
<B>Towards conceptual clarity</B>
<P>
At first sight, catchy definitions of what constitutes effective
aid might appear attractive to use, in particular with regard
to economic indicators. The term &quot;aid effectiveness&quot;
is easily used in the same vein as &quot;efficiency&quot;, &quot;significance&quot;
or &quot;impact&quot; of aid. At times, obsession to measure and
demonstrate the results of aid supported development processes
can be observed among policymakers and administrators on the donor
side. Still the understanding of aid and its effectiveness as
being part and parcel of a cooperation relationship between donor
and recipient side parties, is scarcely embedded in practice.
To determine how to make aid more effective requires more than
a quick impact analysis of an individual and perhaps even isolated
development project, Consequently, defining the concept of aid
effectiveness needs to take into account at what levels cooperation
is focused on. To strive for sustainable and effective modes of
development cooperation will entail the need to combine recipient
ownership of the development process with donor accountability
concerns.
<P>
Performance expectations cannot be exclusively placed on the recipient
while donor interests, their aid management systems and procedures
remain unchanged.
<P>
An extended and more analytical, process oriented definition should
take into account four main aspects of aid effectiveness:
<ul>
a) effective aid must relate to the building and/or strengthening
of incountry aid management capacity;
<P>
b) to maximise the degree of aid effectiveness, local ownership
of the aid process is essential: from setting of priorities through
policy formulation and implementation on to the evaluation stages
of the process;
<P>
c) increasing recipient side capabilities to take charge of aid
relationship, will need to be combined with arrangements to meet
legitimate donor accountability concerns;
<P>
d) aid effectiveness is a twofaceted objective: its realisation
is equally dependent on increased transparency of donor motives
and on dropping of non-developmental, political and economic aid
objectives of donors.
</ul><P>
In addition a broader range of stakeholders in the aid relationship
needs to be actively involved: extending beyond accountable government
and implementing agencies, to include democratic institutions
and organisations of civil society and of the private sector.
<P>
Applying any definition of aid effectiveness without disaggregating
macroeconomic data and taking into account country specificity
will only lead to unhelpful generalisations about aid and its
effectiveness. It would seem more appropriate to adopt working
definitions against which to assess effectiveness of aid resources
at a countryspecific level. On such a basis one could expect to
arrive at more reliable indicators of how well aid resources contribute
to improving developmental standards and meeting exiting needs.
<P>
<B>From definition to success  key requirements</B>
<P>
Having reached agreement between the recipient and donor on what
should constitute effectiveness of aid is only a starting point.
Embarking on democratic, peaceful and participatory patterns of
economic and social development must follow: to arrive at significant
and lasting improvements in many of the least developed countries
will be a long-term process. This being said, it is crucial to
design and implement such forms of development cooperation which
involve a wide range of recipient side actors, not only from the
government side but also from civil society at large. Seen as
a process of increasing inclusion of intended beneficiaries of
aid, the commitment to decentralise as well as entrust aid and
its management grows in importance.
<P>
To fully capture Third World development realities, policy frameworks
inspired by neo-liberalist type of development concepts and theories
are grossly inadequate. The views and positions on aid articulated
in the World Bank and the IMF, or in many if not most bilateral
aid administrations in OECD countries, represent only one side
of today's international cooperation, namely the donor side. The
major weakness to point out with respect to this locus of debate,
is a profound under-representation if not even a total absence
of recipient experiences and perceptions on aid in general and
on its effectiveness in particular. There should be little doubt
that ignoring or not actively identifying and involving such perceptions,
leads to strongly donor-driven aid.
<P>
To circumvent recipient side insights and views on strengths and
weaknesses of aid strategies and mechanisms, will result in limited
local commitment and sense of ownership over the aid process.
Mutual decisionmaking between donors and recipients remains a
rare policy approach. Aid procedures that are based on local management
and less controloriented donor roles in the aid process are still
exceptions in development cooperation.
<P>
Structurally, in terms of the policy environment within which
development aid is expected to function, the overriding policy
framework is generally based on structural adjustment policies
(SAP). But the underlying conclusion made by proponents of SAPs
that these policies induce aid effectiveness, has yet to be proven
valid. It must suffice at this point to emphasize that there is
no a priori relationship between world market integration under
structural adjustment and sustainable development in poor countries.
Aid to these countries which is solely intended to reinforce fundamentally
uneven and unequal patterns of world market integration should
at be scrutinised critically.
<P>
Some central issues need to be addressed in the course of improving
aid and its effectiveness:
<ul>
<li>institutional dimensions of aid relationships require strong
policyattention, both on the donor and the recipient side;
<li>capacities to effectively identify and formulate aid priorities
need to be strengthened in recipient countries;
<li>local capacities to sustain reform efforts must be reinforced.
</ul><P>
<B>Levels of intervention</B>
<P>
If the design of aid and the terms upon which it is provided to
a developing country are largely determined by the donor, the
aid relationship can be characterised as essentially hierarchical.
Recipient side views will rarely surface, as they are either not
identified, or not well formulated. Possibilities of a recipientled
development strategies can be limited. Unless scope is provided
to the recipient side actors to assume responsibilities, aid effectiveness
is likely to remain low or fluctuating, and the sustainablility
of donor aid efforts will remain doubtful.
<P>
National planning processes and courses of national development
in recipient countries should be seen as most effective where
they are led under local responsibility and control. To arrive
at this ideal situation, gaps need to be reduced and closed at
the various intervention levels.
<P>
Donor aid resources provide valuable support for this process.
Their effectiveness in meeting long-term objective of aid will
need to be assessed on the basis of how well they perform at the
different levels. Individual donors will expectedly perform differently
at the various levels. What will prove to be the ultimate test
for effectiveness is how well the donor aid performance accomplishes
the broader objectives of development cooperation and how well
it induces sustainable results.
<P>
In the analytical framework outlined here, development cooperation
would seem to be confronted with the effectiveness gaps at the
<ul>
<li>structural level: international trade and investment patterns,
debt problems and world market integration processes appear as
longterm constraining factors upon aid and its effectiveness;
<li>policy level, dialogue and partnership in development
cooperation are instrumental factors in precluding planning and
coordination gaps with regard to policy analysis and formulation;
<li>institutional level is where pertinent capacity gaps
exist: capacity development efforts of donors and technical assistance
measures play an important role in addressing weaknesses in aid
effectiveness within a country's institutional setting; 
<li>finally, at the level of aid projects (programmes), it
is generally the lack of sustainability of aid interventions which
causes development activities to falter once donor support decreases
or stops. In addition to technical cooperation, financial and
material inputs serve to maintain project momentum and goal realisation:
the issue of how to develop local capacity sufficiently in order
for indigenous organisations to continue project activities initially
supported by donor aid, remains the most important issue to address
at this level.</ul>
<P>
<B>Fostering aid effectiveness</B>
<P>
In recent years donor aid budgets have been reshuffled, while
having decreased in real terms. Geographical redistributions of
reduced aid budgets have been accompanied by the need to accommodate
rising emergency needs.
<P>
Additional resources to meet these needs have not been forthcoming:
in general, aid budgets destined for developmental purposes have
been under severe pressures while urgent humanitarian needs have
added to the drain on resources.
<P>
Donor and recipient development efforts are too often isolated
from one another, or poorly coordinated. They fail to address
<P>
managerial and implementation bottlenecks. Crosssectoral linkages,
as well as interdisciplinary approaches to aid problems are only
slowly gaining ground. It is increasingly obvious, that decisions
on aid issues are subjected to concerns outside of the responsible
ministry: finance ministers, economics ministers and unfortunately
even defense ministers have a strong say in how much aid is to
be provided, where it is to be concentrated and under what terms
to be utilised. Inside of recipient countries, large portions
of national budgets are allocated to non-development priorities
with little or no impact on alleviating urgent poverty problems.
<P>
Development cooperation may make the biggest impact and be executed
most effectively where donors and recipients agree upon multilevel
aid strategies. To give an example: building a road to a remote
rural area may well be done in an effective project manner: it
is equally important to have a functioning transport authority
in place to ensure maintenance of the roads. If this authority
operates within a nationally defined infrastructure policy, best
in accord with national trade and investment priorities, then
the effectiveness of the projectlevel road building programme
has a good chance of being high.
<P>
Institutional changes to set the stage for a profound reform process
in development cooperation are needed. Reprioritising national
budgets to reflect identified in-country development needs may
be one step. Setting up policy evaluation and formulation units
can be complimentary measures. Deregulating markets and investment
rules may serve to please donors, but dumping of cheap products
which strangle local production efforts may easily result. Regional
cooperation, including intensified SouthSouth cooperation can
provide some counterbalance. There are only a few areas where
changes in the current system of development cooperation can occur,
with a view to better manage the complexities of aid and the social,
cultural, economic and political backgrounds against which they
take place. The will and commitment to take policy action in both
donor and recipient countries, through the broadest range of stakeholders
and institutions as possible, will be the test for genuine efforts
at improving development relations between North and South and
organising cooperation effectively.

Loud rave music boomed out from two parked lorries.  Children played in sand on the road.  People danced, drank, painted designs on the road, even stripped naked - all in the name of opposing 'car culture'.<p>

They are part of a growing movement - in Britain and abroad - which is forcing governments to confront the problems of an unsustainable economy.

<b>German development cooperation is in a difficult phase. The Federal
government claims its aid is contributing to securing the global
future. But this is confronted by declining financial commitments
and a growing scepticism among the German public about the success
of development cooperation as a whole. So Bonn's development policy
is facing several challenges. It needs more money, sustainable
improvement of its effectiveness and efficiency, more influence
on other policies, intensive public relations, a more realistic
portrayal of the impacts development cooperation can achieve,
and a more precise determination of its role in Germany's relations
with developing countries.</b>
<P>
Germany's Official Development Assistance (ODA) began in 1952
with a financial contribution to a UN programme to support the
economic development of Third World countries. In 1956, the Foreign
Ministry set up a DM 50 million fund for bilateral aid. And at
the end of the 1950s the Bonn Parliament came out for an active
North south policy. The growing volume of aid, handled by various
federal ministries, as well as party politics within the conservative liberal
coalition government of the day, led to the establishment of the
Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ) in 1961. Liberal
Free Democrat Walter Scheel was its first minister. In 1993, the
words &quot;and Development&quot; were added to its name.
<P>
Initially, the BMZ was a coordinating ministry. In 1964, it was
given competence for development cooperation principles and programmes,
as well as for Technical Cooperation (TC). In 1972, under minister
Erhard Eppler, its remit was expanded to cover bilateral and multilateral
Financial Cooperation (FC). It was only then that development
policy was established de facto as a separate policy.
<P>
<B>Quantitative aspects</B>
<P>
Measured against absolute ODA volumes, Germany is one of the world's
largest donors (1993: DM 11.5 billion, or US$ 6.95 billion). It
ranks fourth after Japan, the USA and France. But Germany's ODA-GNP
ratio positions it midfield among the 21 donor country members
of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC). In 1993,
with an ODA-GNP share of 0.36 per cent, it came ninth.
<P>
Assessment of the ODA volume depends upon the frame of reference.
Germany's ODA appears marginal when compared, for example, with
its trade with developing countries (1993: exports plus imports
totalled about DM 200 billion). This is also the case when Bonn's
ODA is measured against its transfers to Germany's new eastern
Lander (states) of about DM 150 billion a year. These have recently
often been used as a yardstick. But on the other hand, German
ODA has to date exceeded private flows to developing countries
at market conditions.
<P>
No-one disputes that Germany has not yet achieved the UN's 0.7
per cent ODA GNP target, to which the Federal government again gave the nod
at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Nor that Bonn has in recent years
dropped further away from it. The German ODA-GNP ratio reached
its high water mark in 1982/83 with 0.48 per cent. But since 1990
(0.42 per cent), its ODA share has fallen steadily. In 1993 it
was 0.36 per cent, and it dropped to 0.33 per cent in 1994.
<P>
True, Germany is not the only DAC donor with declining ODA-GNP
ratios. The ODA budgets of numerous other countries have been
squeezed for some years, justifying talk of a financial crisis
in international development assistance. But the drop in Germany's
ODA-GNP ratio is disproportionately large when measured against
the DAC average (1990: 0.33 per cent; 1993: 0.30 per cent). Bonn
blames public spending constraints for the fall. But development
cooperation's diminished political status in the Federal budget
must not be overlooked. BMZ's share of the budget, which covers
most of German ODA (see Table 1), dropped from 2.4 per cent in
1989 to 1.7 per cent in 1995 (its top share was 2.6 per cent),
and will probably hardly increase to 1998.
<P>
German development cooperation includes not only ODA, but also
development assistance by NGOs, such as churches, foundations
and associations, from their own funds and donations. Over the
years, they have accounted for an amazingly constant equivalent
of 11-12 per cent of ODA, which should be differentiated from
the subsidies these organizations receive from the government.

<B>Who provides aid?</B>
<P>
German ODA's actors are very diverse. This applies to the financing
(provision of funds), as well as the implementation of projects
and programmes. The German ODA reported to the DAC embraces:
<P>
<ul>
<li>BMZ development assistance totalling more than 70 per cent of ODA, making it the most important actor;
<P>
<li>development assistance of other Federal ministries, above all the Foreign Ministry (humanitarian aid,
materials and equipment assistance, cultural cooperation, contributions
to UN organizations); the Ministry of Education, Science, Research
and Technology; and the Ministry of Economics; and
<P>
<li>development assistance of the federal states (Lander) (study
place costs for students from developing countries, and own cooperation
measures).</ul>
<P>
In addition, there are Germany's contributions to the EU's development
budget, debt servicing relief, and part of the expenditure on
political refugees in Germany. The involvement of several ministries
in development cooperation is more
marked in some other donor countries than in Germany, for example,
in France and Japan.
<P>
A peculiarity of German development cooperation is the developmental
commitment of the L&#228;nder. They are involved primarily in the education
sector, but for some years have also promoted their own projects.
German municipalities also engage in developmental activities
in the context of partnerships and local government cooperation.
<P>
<B>Bilateral and multilateral aid</B>
<P>
Germany perceives itself first and foremost as a bilateral donor.
Its bilateral ODA
accounted for 70 per cent of its overall development assistance
to 1993 (see Table 1). Bonn bases this above all on its claim,
as one of the major donors, to operate its own development policy.
It says it has specialised and differentiated instruments for
implementing this policy. But it has also in recent years increasingly
criticized the lack of efficiency of multilateral cooperation.
Its unwritten guideline could read: &quot;As much bilateral aid
as possible, as much multilateral aid as necessary.&quot;
<P>
After Japan and the USA, Germany is the third largest financial
supporter of multilateral cooperation (as at 1993), and ranks
first on the EU development aid league table. Over the years,
Bonn has fulfilled its intention, declared in the 1970s, to earmark
about 30 per cent of its ODA for multilateral cooperation. This
is despite fluctuations which were due primarily to the payment
cycle. Germany has also collaborated steadfastly in multilateral
organizations and pressed for reforms. And it has renounced spectacular
steps such as the withdrawal of the USA and Britain from UNESCO.
From 1950 to 1993, 41.6 per cent of Germany's multilateral ODA
went to the European Community or Union, 39.6 per cent to the
World Bank and the regional development banks, 14.7 per cent to
UN organizations and funds, and 4.1 per cent to others.
<P>
Germany has always supported EC or EU development cooperation
(strictly speaking, the EU is a supranational, and not a multilateral,
institution), which above all had its roots in French and British
self interests, as well as European Parliament ventures. Not least,
Bonn has been the main financial contributor. But it has never
played a leading role as an initiator. In contrast to France and
Britain, whose colonial legacy has strongly influenced the regional
alignment of EC/EU development cooperation, Germany has from the
start preferred a more global approach to it. Bonn has also criticized the European Development Fund's
disproportionately low level of procurement orders to German contractors
compared with French companies, and the inefficiencies of EU aid.
<P>
The federal government has for a long time advocated better coordination
of EU development cooperation, although not a stronger communalising
of the member countries' individual aid programmes. Germany therefore
appears to be more reserved in the development cooperation field
than might be expected because of its intensive efforts for political
union. In that respect, the Maastricht Treaty, which lays down
that EU and bilateral development cooperation should be complementary,
corresponds completely with the Federal government's intentions.

<P>
<B>Regional focal points</B>
<P>
The development cooperation of France and Britain reflects their
ties to their former colonies. US aid is concentrated on Israel
and Egypt for security policy reasons. In contrast, Germany's
assistance was from the beginning guided by the principle that
it was open to the world. This was in line
with Bonn's foreign policy interests; a striving for worldwide
recognition and preventing international acceptance of the GDR.
But it also stuck the then West Germany's aid with the label of
being based on the principle of &quot;something for everyone&quot;.
<P>
This type-casting hits the mark in terms of the great number of
countries with which the Federal Republic fosters developmental
relations. In 1992, German Technical Cooperation (TC) projects
were either being appraised, prepared or implemented in 150 countries.
And new TC commitments had been made to 130 countries. The corresponding
figures for Financial Cooperation (FC) were 105 and 66 countries.
<P>
However, German development cooperation is clearly concentrated.
During the period 195093, 26 per cent of Germany's net bilateral
ODA disbursements were made to the five most important recipient
countries (India, Israel, Egypt, Turkey and Indonesia), and 37
per cent to the 10 most important countries. This reflects foreign
policy and geopolitical interests.
<P>
Table 2 shows the regional distribution of German aid. It makes
clear that sub saharan Africa's share has increased, while Asia's has declined. The share of least developed countries (LDCs)
fluctuates considerably, and in 1993 equalled about the DAC average.
Other donors such as the EU or some Scandinavian countries have
greater LDC disbursements.
<P>
The BMZ (not least due to pressure from the Parliamentary Budget
Committee) has for some years been trying to reduce the number
of recipient countries and achieve a stronger regional concentration
of German aid. The main motive is to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of cooperation by bundling it. The BMZ also intends
to foster development cooperation only with partner countries
whose political and economic general conditions favour successful
cooperation. The effort to downsize the number of recipient countries
is in line with the &quot;graduation&quot; of threshold countries
who &quot;grow out&quot; of development aid. On the other hand,
other countries have become new German development cooperation
partners (Albania, the Central Asian and Caucasian developing
countries, and South Africa).
<P>
<B>Aid for the East at the cost of the South?</B>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Germany has been the leading
western donor in financially supporting the transformation process
of the Central and East European countries and the successor states
of the former Soviet Union. In 1993, it accounted for about one third
of the official aid of all DAC member countries. German official
aid to those countries, without the Central Asian and Caucasian
states which the DAC has meanwhile recognised as developing countries,
as well as Albania, totalled about US$ 8.4 billion in 1991 93.
The disbursements thereby accounted for almost 40 per cent of
Bonn's total ODA to developing countries. But they were not made
at the cost of the South. Most of the money did not come from
the BMZ's budget, but of course it increased the general spending
burden of the Federal budget.

<P>
<B>Sectoral focal points</B>
<P>
Table 3 shows that social and administrative infrastructure and
economic infrastructure are the two main promotion sectors of
German bilateral development cooperation. Three things are noteworthy
in the period covered (1989-93). These are the more or less constant
weighting of social infrastructure, the distinct decrease of economic
infrastructure and the productive sectors, and the sharp increase in the share of debt relief
and humanitarian aid. The latter was above all aid for refugees,
which has also risen markedly in some other donor countries.
<P>
But while Table 3 presents a picture of sectoral focal points,
German aid, or more precisely its TC, is involved in a great number
of individual areas. This is a result of the growing differentiation
of development policy goals since the 1970s. But it bears the
inherent risk of over fragmentation, or becoming a sectoral &quot;wateringcan&quot;.
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the BMZ has defined as priorities
of bilateral cooperation the three &quot;key areas&quot; of alleviating
poverty, protection of the environment and resources, and education,
supplemented by the promotion of women. Developmental measures
in the various sectors and areas are to concentrate on these priorities
which, except perhaps for education, are cross-sectoral tasks.
<P>
According to the BMZ, 4050 per cent of the government's recent
commitments relate to projects of satisfying basic needs (these
include 13 per cent for alleviating poverty by help for self help),
about 30 per cent relate to environmental and resources projects
(1988: 15 per cent), and 13 per cent to the educational sector.
Gathering statistics on alleviating poverty is not easy, and it
has therefore, not surprisingly, also given rise to controversy.
<P>
<B>Instruments and conditions of bilateral cooperation</B>
<P>
Germany's bilateral development cooperation has essentially the following instruments (space limits
preclude a more precise breakdown):
<P>
<ul>
<li>Financial Cooperation (FC): favourable credits (depending
on the development level of the partner country, interest rates
of 0.75 per cent or 2 per cent and 40or 30year terms of maturity
with 10year periods of grace), or grants (LDCs) for investment
projects and programmes, as well as aid in kind and structural
adjustment aid. Implementation: Reconstruction Loan Corporation
(KfW);
<P>
<li>Technical Cooperation (TC): strictly speaking, the provision
of experts and materials and equipment assistance on behalf of
the federal government, primarily by the GTZ (cost-free). In the
broader sense, subsidies for the developmental activities of private
project executing organizations;
<P>
<li>Personnel Cooperation (PC): in particular, advanced training
programmes for specialists and executives from developing countries
(cost free), organized mainly by the German Foundation for International
Development (DSE) and the Carl Duisberg Society (CDG); and
<P>
<li>Other forms: food aid, promotion of the cooperation of German
industry with developing countries, and promotion of the latter's
exports.</ul>
<P>
<B>Development cooperation and German unification</B>
<P>
Unification of the two German states meant for Bonn's overall
development policy less of a task of adjustment than in other
political sectors. Most of the former GDR's development programmes
and projects implemented as part of its last Five year Plan had
ended in 1989/90, or had not survived the dissolution of the GDR
structures. After examining former East Germany's 106 projects,
the BMZ continued 64 of them. Moreover, numerous scholarship-holders
from developing countries who were studying in the GDR continued
to be promoted in the new L&#228;nder in eastern Germany.
<P>
<B>Organizational structure</B>
<P>
In contrast to those of most other DAC donor countries, the organizational
structure of German development cooperation has, among other things,
the following characteristics:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Germany has its own development cooperation ministry which
has competence for: laying down the principles, and the financing,
planning, controlling, steering and coordination of all development
policy measures; government negotiations with recipient countries;
and coordination with other donors;
<P>
<li>implementation of development cooperation is assigned to
two central, parastatal organizations (KfW, GTZ), as well as to
numerous other parastatal, semigovernmental and private organizations;
<P>
<li>implementation of FC and TC is institutionally separated
for historical reasons;
<P>
<li>not least due to the traditional reservations of the Foreign Ministry,
the local representation of German development cooperation in
developing countries is weaker than that of a number of other donors.
The latter have to a great extent delegated the planning, implementation
and management of their projects to on site development cooperation
offices. German representation has only in recent years taken
on a more marked form. At present, it encompasses 26 officers
of development cooperation seconded by the BMZ to German embassies,
24 project administration offices and 30 small project service
offices of the GTZ. The KfW has had two local project representatives
(in Cairo and New Delhi) since only recently.</ul>
<P>
<B>Strengths and weaknesses of organizational structure</B>
<P>
The organization of German development cooperation has advantages
and disadvantages. The advantages include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>the existence of strong project implementing organizations
such as the KfW and GTZ. The other donors, where implementation
is incumbent upon development cooperation authorities or agencies,
either do not have such organizations or only to a limited extent.
The KfW and GTZ can work more flexibly than a cooperation authority.
They have also accumulated a great deal of regional and sectoral
professional knowledge, and in this respect enjoy international
repute; and
<P>
<li>the very differentiated organizational structure of implementation,
involving the participation of numerous NGOs and organizations
of German industry and commerce. Despite coordination problems,
these structures deliver pluralism, offer possibilities for specialization,
and tend to increase the public's acceptance of development cooperation.
The five foundations of the political parties are a German peculiarity.</ul>
<P>
On the other hand, the organization of German development cooperation
also has several disadvantages:
<P>
<ul>
<li>the inadequate division of labour between the BMZ on one side
and the KfW and GTZ on the other. This results in the BMZ's competence
ranging from decisions on principles to the levels of developmental (in contrast to specialist-technical) planning and management
of every individual project. It also leads to overlapping of work
between the institutions and cramps the BMZ's capacity for conceptional
work;
<P>
<li>the institutional separation of FC and TC, which is unknown
to most other donors. In view of the trend to more comprehensive
forms of aid (programme assistance, support of structural adjustment
programmes, capacity building), the split is also causing increasing
difficulties; and
<P>
<li>the relatively weak local representation of German development
cooperation in developing countries. The DAC has repeatedly criticized
it, and it also hampers the adequate planning and management of
activities in close contact with partner countries.</ul>
<P>
<B>Developmental concept, paramount goals, self-interests</B>
<P>
In order to characterize the intents of German development cooperation,
it is useful to differentiate between the developmental concept,
paramount goals and &quot;self interests&quot; (nondevelopment
cooperation objectives) linked with it:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Developmental concept: the declared goal of German development
policy  to support economic and social development in the recipient
countries by help for self help, and thereby contribute to improving
living conditions  has basically not changed since it began. What
has changed are the concepts in pursuit of that goal. German development
cooperation has in principle gone all the way with the changes in
international developmental concepts over the years. Expressed
in very simple terms, these saw strong emphasis on economic infrastructure
and education in the 1960s; on satisfying basic needs in the 1970s;
on structural adjustment, policy dialogue and strengthening the
private sector in the 1980s; and concentration on poverty alleviation,
the environment and education since the beginning of the 1990s.
Germany assumed a certain role of initiative giver among the donors
when the BMZ introduced its new allocation criteria in October
1991. These identified human rights, participation of the people,
rule of law, a market friendly and social economic order, and government
action oriented on development as priorities, of which the first
three are explicitly political benchmarks. The change in the concepts
(which in the view of the administration is sometimes too rapid)
does not in the nature of things lead every time to fundamental
changes in developmental practice, but rather to gradual adjustments.
<P>
<li>Paramount goals: Traditionally, German development cooperation
has always been perceived in Bonn as part of a global peace policy
(which is still enshrined in the Federal Government's &quot;Basic
Principles of Development Policy&quot; of 1986). Since the end
of the East west conflict, the motive of securing the future of
humankind has come increasingly to the fore. That reflects growing
awareness of the new global threats posed by environmental degradation,
population growth, international refugee flows or regional and
ethnic conflicts with cross-border impacts.
<P>
<li>Self interests: German development cooperation has always been
integrated in the network of overall foreign relations. Like every
other political sector, it is subject to the Constitutional imperative
to benefit the German people and avert danger to them, and therefore
also has to serve German interests.</ul>
<P>
The definition of German interests is thereby decisive. They can
relate either to such basic goals as securing peace or the 
 future, or to quite specific foreign policy, 
foreign trade or domestic political interests. In the second case, conflicts of objectives can arise in development cooperation. In fact, concrete self interests have
always influenced and partly also impaired
the practice of German development cooperation. Such as the Hallstein Doctrine
(the rundown of diplomatic relations with countries which recognized former East
Germany), the checking of Communism, securing exports and raw
materials, creation of domestic employment by securing procurement
orders from ODA, and improving German industry's competitive position
in important export markets.
<P>
Compared with other donors, when it comes to the relationship
between development policy and self interests Germany stands midfield.
It has never subordinated its development cooperation policy to
foreign and security interests so blatantly as the USA has done,
or, like Japan in the past, to foreign trade interests. But on
the other hand, Germany has also never sought such a distinct
developmental profile as various &quot;likeminded countries&quot;,
for example some Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, have
done in the past.
<P>
<B>Development policy among political parties, parliament and public</B>
<P>
Germany's development policy enjoys a positive consensus among
all the main political parties, parliament and the public, despite
many differences (which are also partly a matter of style for
political &quot;show business&quot; reasons) and some scepticism
over the practice of cooperation. This is a great developmental
asset, even if development policy has naturally less importance
in political and public minds than domestic and economic topics.
<P>
Development policy is an agenda for all parties represented in
the Bundestag. Not only for their manifestos and election campaigns,
but also for parliamentary debates, question times and, not least,
in consultations and decision taking on the BMZ budget. Parliament's
development policy debate is carried out intensively in the Development
Policy Committee, whose influence on the practice of cooperation
is, however, less than that of the Budget Committee.
<P>
According to opinion polls, the great majority of Germans (in
both the old and the new L&#228;nder) endorses development cooperation,
even in hard economic times. This positive basic attitude is also
reflected in their great readiness to make donations, which they
have shown for decades. Furthermore, the polls show:
<P>
<ul>
<li>an increase in awareness of the interdependence of the developments in the
North and South;
<P>
<li>overestimation of not only the quantitative significance but also the possible impacts of development cooperation;
<P>
<li>low awareness of government development cooperation compared with the work of NGOs; and
<P>
<li>growing scepticism over the practice of government development
cooperation, which is based on reports of failures, doubts about
the &quot;feasibility&quot; of the aid, and suspicion that it
is only an &quot;alibi&quot; to camouflage the pursuit of economic
selfinterests.</ul>
<P>
<B>Challenges</B>
<P>
A development policy that claims to contribute to global securing
of the future needs the following to remain credible at home
and abroad:
<P>
a) in the medium term, an increase again in funds;
<P>
b) more political influence in the sense of political coherence.
Many policies play a role in relations with developing countries
(e.g. in the areas of foreign policy, agriculture, trade, direct
investment, indebtedness, environment, refugees) which are not
part of the domain of development policy, but which touch upon
it strongly and in part counteract it. These policies must be
reviewed more intensively for their global impacts and developmental
soundness. In the Maastricht Treaty, Germany acknowledged the
imperative of coherence.
<P>
c) a sustainable improvement of effectiveness and efficiency.
This applies not only to the general conditions in the
partner countries, as important as they are, but also the aid
delivery on the German side.
<P>
Lines of approach, besides greater political coherence, are: relieving
the BMZ of responsibility for projects (except for the evaluation
of results which, rather, must be intensified); strengthening
its capacity for politicalconceptual work (which will also enable
it to &quot;occupy&quot; the agenda of global securing of the
future even more intensively among the Bonn ministries); concentrating
development cooperation on fewer countries (perhaps in agreement
with other EU donors) and also fewer sectors in bilateral cooperation;
consistent fostering of the country strategy papers as an important
developmental management instrument; closer cooperation (and finally
merging) of FC and TC; and strengthening of foreign representation.
<P>
d) a more precise definition of the role of development cooperation
in the overall network of relations with developing countries.
Development policy is undisputedly part of German cooperation
relations with developing countries and regions, and with its
special terms of reference and instruments can make an important
contribution to shaping them.
<P>
The criticism that a development policy which feels itself obliged
to alleviate poverty is only something for the LDCs and cannot
cope with the cooperation needs of advanced developing countries
misses the point in many respects. On the one hand, poverty is
also a relevant problem in many of the latter countries. And on
the other, it is precisely development cooperation that can make
them interesting offers (e.g. advisory services in fields such
as social, labour market, education, environment or urban development
policies). These offers have a great deal to do with alleviating
poverty, and are ones with which development cooperation, compared
with other German cooperation policies, have advantages. A social
and environmentally sound development of the partner countries
is in Germany's including in the economic sense.
<P>
But although active promotion of German exports is a legitimate
concern, it is not a task of development cooperation. It should
therefore be represented vigorously in parliament and among the
public as a policy in itself, if necessary also with a view to
appropriate funds.

<h3>
New Internationalist Issue 269</h3>
<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="NIinfo.html">  New Internationalist</a></i>
<hr>
<center>Techno Passion</center><p>

<font size=+1><i>New technology arouses strong passions.  Will it solve our problems, create new ones or make a very little difference at all? Here's a view or two on the technology that's likely to be shaping human life in the year 2025...</font></i><p>
<hr width=75%>

<center><h2>EASY DRIVING </h2></center>

Lean, clean, lightweight vehicles powered by hydrogen or electricity and which can drive themselves will get the 2025 traveller from A to B. Hydrogen cars have already been developed by several companies and vehicles can be equipped with sensors to monitor the road and surrounding vehicles. The'driver' will be able to sit back and read a book while a computer accelerates, breaks and steers. A single lane of an automated highway could carry at least 6,000 vehicles per hour, three times more than a conventional highway. Accidents would be reduced by at least half. Fuel-saving initiatives -like car pooling and fast tracks for cars with four or more passengers - already exist and could be extended. The gas-guzzling, fossilfuel burning vehicles that wreaked environmental havoc in the twentieth cewntury will be consigned to the museum.<p>


<i>Fat chance! If motor companies already have the technology for eco-friendly vehicles why aren't they making them? 'cos it's more profitable not to change. They'll use fossil fuel till world resources run dry! And by then we can say goodbye to the ozone layer....</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left>

<center><h2>FRIENDLY BUILDINGS </h2></center>

The buildings in which the 2025 citizen will live and work are likely to be eco-friendly and quiet. Reflectors, skylights and high-tech systems that pipe sunlight deep inside will reduce the need for artificial lights. The sun will be the main source of energy. Electricity will be produced by solar photo-voltaic cells, integrated into facades or roofs. People will be able to buy power from the local utility and sell power back to it, depending on need and the time of day. Super-insulated buildings will be able to heat themselves, making use of waste heat from occupants, lights and appliances. Simple remedies will make a comeback: like planting vegetation around buildings to retain heat in the winter and cool in the summer.<p>


<i>Excuse me, but how are homeless people in Bombay, Manila, London or New York going to benefit from your lovely eco-friendly architecture? Perhaps the arches will have eco-friendly under-bellies? Perhaps the 2025 street will have plusher gutters?</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left>


<center><h2>SMART INFORMATION</h2></center>

There will be a worldwide, broadband network of networks based on fibre optics. All kinds of communication -face to face, voice to voice, person to data, and data to data -will be available to any place at any time from anywhere. Education on a worldwide basis will be at a higher level and more accessible. Hand-held computers will be the norm. Money in the form of physical currency will have long been replaced by'smart' cards. Communications vocabulary will be part of the language as people'televote','teleshop','telework', tele-everything and mind their 'netiquette' during virtual encounters. Crime will be increasingly sophisticated, economic and computer-based.<p>


<i>And what about direct human contact? What about maintaining real, physical communities? Are we all going to be E-dropping, E-mail-swapping computer nerds, surfing in cyberspace instead of spending time on our real relationships, in our real communities? And is everyone going to have equal access to this information? Pull the other one!</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left>

<center><h2>DIET FOR HEALTH</h2></center>

Genetic engineering will have had a profound effect on medicine. By 2025 all human ailments that have a genetic link will be identified and mapped. Direct targeted interventions for disease control will be the norm. But controversy is likely to rage over whether genetic engineering should be used to change or'enhance' people's capacities, and those in favour will be up against the powerful holistic medicine movement. Foods for human consumption could be more diverse as a result of agricultural genetics, with crop plants developed so that each part is usable. But the prospect of dangerous, genetically-engineered organisms being accidentally released into the environment is a hazard 2025 citizens will have to live with. In the richer countries vegetarianism will ahve become the norm - for health, environmental and ethical reasons. For carnivores with a conscience, 'Nanotechnology' will have provided the answer: by redesigning the cellular structures it will be possible to turn hay into steak without involving a cow.<p>


<i>'Controversy is likely to rage'. Too bloody right! What multinational corporations are going to control biotechnology? And who is going to control them? They are already richer and more powerful than national governments. And now we are going to let them take control of the genetic stuff of life itself? You can keep your veggie beef, thankyou!</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left>
 
<center><h2>SENSITIVE CITIES</h2></center> 

The city of 2025 could be'sensitive', almost biological. Built into its structures -bridges, roads, buildings -will be'sensors' that respond to changes in heat, light, noise or electromagnetic fields. A bridge, for example, would have sensitive fibre'nerves' that could feel structural deterioration, cry out a warning and even take reparative action. It might be made of self-repairing concrete, for example. Noise pollution could also be combated. As sound travels in waves it could be cancelled out by superimposing on it an identical wave of opposite phase. Acoustic wallpaper could cut out the sound of noisy neighbours. This will be useful as the cities of 2025 are likely to follow the traditional European models with high densities combined with plenty of green space rather than the low-density, automobile-dependent sprawling cities of US and Australia.<p>


<i>So are we to get our bridges and walls to have our feelings for us as we live in our quiet, solipsistic cocoons, oblivious to neighbours and other'disturbances'? What if the neighbours are calling out for help -or warning us of danger? Is the artificial to become more biological, at the cost of the biological (us humans, for example) becoming artificial?</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left><p>


<center><h2>NATURAL ENERGY</h2></center>

Wind farms and solar ranches will appear in the landscapes of the 2025 world. The Thar Desert in India, the Sahara in North Africa, La Ventosa in Mexico and the US Great Plains will be ideal locations. The electricity they generate will be fed into grids when demand is high and used to produce hydrogen when low. But most people will produce their own energy locally, using photo-voltaic cells. Hydrogen will replace natural gas as supplies of the latter level off or are kept in the ground to reduce carbon emissions. Hydrogen is light, abundant and when combined with oxygen to produce heat or electricity the main emission is water. The technology to produce hydogen -electrolosis- has been around since the nineteenth century. By 2025 the idea that energy should be produced from non-renewable and pollution sources will be anathema.<p>


<i>What about the resistance? Governments and industry have such a huge vested interest in using non-renewable energy sources that they subsidize these to the tune of billions. And if households do generate their own energy, what's that going to do to energy jobs?</i><hr width=80%><p><br clear=left>

<center><h2>SAFE AND SOUND</h2></center> 

Remote-sensing will warn of impending natural disasters, earthquakes, landslides and flooding. Worldwide weather reporting will be routine, detailed and accurate. Biotechnology -which will be a booming industry by 2025 -may be used to help break down the awful residue of hazardous wastes left by the twentieth century. 'Smart' non-lethal weapons that halt aggressive acts will have replaced lethal weapons for peace-keeping and policing.<p>


<i>Biotechnology will be a source of danger -not security! Sure, non-lethal weapons are nicer -but there will always be people wanting to use lethal ones. The real issue is: what are we going to do about inequalities of power? What are we going to do about a worldwide culture of militarism? What answers has technology got for  that, I ask you?!!!</i><hr width=80%><br clear=left><p>

<H3>The Cross-Border Initiative</H3>

<P>
by <I>Ali Mansoor</I>
<P>
Full text of an article from <I>DPMN Bulletin, 2(1) April 1994:
pages 8-9</I> </CENTER><HR>

<H4>Objectives and History</H4>

<P>
The Cross-Border Initiative (CBI) aims to facilitate private investment,
trade and payments between the countries of East and Southern
Africa and the Indian Ocean which are members of the PTA, SADCC,
and IOC. By so doing it is hoped to move these regional groups
towards increased economic integration.
<P>
The CBI was jointly launched in early 1992 by the African Development
Bank (ADB), the European Commission (EC), the IMF and the World
Bank with financing from the US, Swiss and Canadian governments.
The Initiative reflects extensive discussions between the co-sponsors,
the relevant regional institutions and public and private sector
representatives of most of the Eastern and Southern African States
(Burundi, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius,
Namibia, Reunion, Rwanda, Swaziland, South Africa (in observer
status), Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe).
<P>
The first phase consisted of a desk study that proposed terms
of reference for work by national Technical Working Groups (TWGs).
The TWGs were appointed by interested governments and had equal
representation from the private and public sectors. The second
phase began in June 1992 in Mauritius where representatives of
the TWGs from 15 countries finalised these TORs. In November 1992,
the representatives of the TWGs synthesised their various proposals
into a Common Program of Action (CPA) that would be used as the
basis for a Concept Paper. This paper would propose how governments
could implement the CPA with donor support and under the auspices
of the PTA, SADC and IOC. The Concept Paper was modified  by a
meeting of senior officials in Brussels in June 1993 and then
endorsed without further changes by a Ministerial meeting in 
Uganda in August 1993. As of January 1994, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius,
Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe have invited the co-sponsors
to initiate discussions on implementation.
<H4>Institutional and Managerial Aspects that Contributed to the
Success of the CBI</H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Involvement of the private sector</B>. Right from the outset,
the focus was on finding out from the private sector what was
hindering cross-border economic activity. This active participation
of the private sector kept the proposed package practical, avoided
ideological pitfalls, and helped to overcome some initial resistance
by some of the regional organisations. In Mauritius for example,
private sector representatives demanded that the regional organisations
should recognise their failure to eliminate barriers to private
intra-regional economic transactions and  that they rally around
the CBI. The one weakness has been the insufficient involvement
of the international private sector, but that is now being remedied
by instituting a dialogue with organisations such as the Group
of Seven and the European Roundtable (organisations regrouping
European firms interested in assisting the development of Africa).
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Local support to the TWGs</B>. The initial enthusiasm of
individual TWG members could have declined with competing demands
on their time. To avoid this, a local resident was hired to provide
the services of a secretariat to the TWG. This consultant also
undertook research required by the TWG and put together various
documents including the final report. As a local resident, the
consultant could be integrated into the TWG structures and was
aware of cultural and political sensitivities. Moreover, since
the consultant was responsible to the TWG and not to the co-sponsors,
any work was requested, digested and approved by the TWG. Thus,
the output reflected the consensus of the group and, to the extent
that the TWG was chosen in a representative manner, a wider social
consensus. A foreign 'expert' making the same recommendations
would not have had the same impact. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Gradual consensus building</B>. Asking local businessmen
and public officials to discuss problems and possible solutions
in the TWGs allowed the development of consensus at the national
level among key economic agents and decision-makers. Furthermore,
the TWGs are an embryonic pressure group for implementing the
required reform package recommended by the group. Local participants
bring an awareness of areas where reforms need to take account
of social sensitivities and administrative bottlenecks.
</UL>

<P>
 
<UL>
<LI><B>Involvement of all  players -- domestic, regional and international</B>.
The initial co-sponsors have been reinforced by an intense dialogue
with regional and pan-African organisations. At the regional level,
an intensive dialogue was undertaken with regional and pan-African
organisations to ensure that the package was acceptable to all.
It is noteworthy that the OAU and  have endorsed the CBI despite
their condemnation of variable geometry in general and the UEMOA
initiative in particular. This outcome reflects their close involvement
in the process as well as the pressures for realism and pragmatism
exerted on the process by the private sector. In dealing with
the problems of economic fragmentation in Africa, there is sufficient
common ground and a large enough agenda that a role for all relevant
organisations can be found.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>An agenda set by the most interested parties: the private
sector in consultation with government</B>. Dialogue, consensus
building and sharing out responsibilities are the foundations
upon which the CBI is built. This internalisation of the process
has allowed a compromise between the measures that the private
sector perceives as desirable and those the government sees as
politically feasible.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Loose mechanisms and arrangements for coordination within
a clearly specified framework</B>. With a large variety of domestic,
regional and international institutions, coordination of efforts
could have been a nightmare. A flexible structure was chosen where
broad principles were developed by a small  Steering Committee
(SC) drawn from the co-sponsors. The SC guided the process and
incorporated reactions and inputs from all parties. From the desk
study through to the Concept Paper, this approach worked because
the inner core was able to gauge the common ground and maintain
group consensus in identifying and moving. While a general time
frame and broad directions for reform were identified at the outset,
the SC was flexible in moving down the path from initial TORs
to recommended reforms. As the process moved closer to implementation,
the SC became more formalised with a more structured agenda and
timetable for its own actions.
</UL>

<P>

<H4>Weaknesses of the Process </H4>

<P>
The main weaknesses of the process are common to all efforts at
institutional development and not necessarily linked to the institutional
arrangements set up under the CBI. They essentially rest on the
need for any organisation to rely on the interaction of people
each of whom has his/her own institutional roles. Addressing such
problems requires close monitoring, much of which could be undertaken
through the secretariats of the PTA, SADC and IOC. Unfortunately
these organisations are not structured to play this role. Under
the CBI, resources are available to help them play a stronger
monitoring role to help address some of the shortcomings. These
include:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Insufficient internalisation</B>. The CBI has only succeeded
superficially in developing the required social and institutional
consensus for the required reforms. This reflects the difficulty
in ensuring that information flows properly within and across
organisations and gets properly internalised. Thus many of the
actors end up representing personal as much as institutional positions.
For example, even though Zambia would benefit significantly from
only marginal reforms, it has had difficulty in developing an
implementation strategy due to a change of TWG Chairman. Similarly,
due to inadequate internal information flows, key units of the
concerned ministries are not sufficiently aware of the implications
of the CBI. Even though the Cabinet discussed and endorsed the
Concept Paper, many officials seem willing to go along only until
an issue of direct concern to their area of competence arises.
Moreover, internalisation by the sponsoring agencies has suffered
from similar difficulties. This is particular true in the IMF
and World Bank where the institutional culture has a traditional
antipathy for regional as opposed to multilateral measures and
given internal organisation set up to deal on a case by case basis
with national governments.</UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Competing issues</B>. Another difficulty is the short attention
span of key policy-makers also need to deal with other, often
more pressing issues. For example, at the last Consultative Group
meeting for Kenya, mobilisation of donor financing for the adjustment
programme crowded out the CBI with its programme of medium term
reforms.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Maintaining focus and consistency</B>. In implementing
the agreed reform package, it has been difficult to maintain the
focus of the decision-makers. The TWG is only an advisory body
and weak internalisation has complicated the task of putting the
reforms on the agenda of senior policy-makers. Given weak internalisation,
the required decentralised approach (on a country by country basis)
that is a strength of the CBI can also be an Achilles heel. Policy-makers
(and the donors working with them) find it hard, in such a context,
to see the linkage between national and regional goals.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Changing balance of power</B>. The TWGs were often appointed
without any real belief that their recommendations would filter
through to national policy-making. As the CBI enters the centre
stage to be considered by policy-makers, the relevance and role
of the TWGs changes. Internal rivalries arise over who should
represent various institutions on the TWG or indeed there are
attempts to circumvent the TWG with other institutions. This disrupts
the process and delays the development and implementation of the
reform package.

<P>
<B>Foreign donor agencies should gradually hand over project responsibility
to domestic management. Presence of expatriate staff is to be
reduced to short-term assignments to strengthen local self-reliance.
These are some conclusions by the author from working in a development
project on Conservation Tillage (Contill) in Zimbabwe.</B>
<P>
Development cooperation is frequently being criticized for lack
of sustainability and effectiveness in improving living conditions
in the so called underdeveloped world. Some critics have even gone
further, charging that the Western concept of development cooperation
has, and still is, contributing to underdevelopment. Local bureaucracies
and the expatriate staff working for the multitude of international
organizations and donors have also been under similar crossfire for gross inefficacy
and alleged development-tourism and country-hopping and project-hopping
respectively. Recently, some of this fundamental criticism has
been echoed in a much publicized conference keynote address by
the World Bank's Vice President for Africa E. W. K. Jaycox. He argues
that the implementation-style characteristic of Western development
cooperation is undermining the institutional and human capacity building
needs of most African countries.
<P>
This painful self-reflection from within the 'development fraternity'
comes at a time when the Western countries are increasingly plagued
by economic woes and, at the same time, faced with the colossal
task of helping restructure the economies of their former Cold
War rivals. The resultant budgetary constraints not only pose
a tremendous challenge for their development organizations such
as the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), but they
also provide a unique chance for reconsidering cooperation concepts
and project implementation.
<P>
It is quite clear that projects have to become truly effective
in empowering the locals to find their own solutions to overcome
poverty and to achieve environmental sustainability. Although
seemingly self evident, it also needs to be stressed that this
process of developing self reliant project approaches has to begin
with genuinely listening to and really involving the local people.
Equally important, in order not to respond to the new challenges
with outmoded reactions, this process also needs to commence with
vision creation in collaborating agencies. In fact, the present
challenges faced by both North and South call for a different
way of looking at what progress and development is all about.
<P>
Although a lot of development projects stand like ruins because
they were 'doing development' rather than assisting in development,
some projects have succeeded in contributing to the empowerment
of people, even if only to a relatively small degree. In fact,
since people only learn from experience, some projects obviously
even have to fail. The response to failure should not be to throw the
entire approach on the scrap yard, but rather to reform it. This
needs to begin with freeing development cooperation of its Western
notion of exclusive correctness. What is required are flexibility,
perspectives, and iterative self reflection. Static approaches
stand no lasting chance in development cooperation, nor in any
other field of human interaction. Development cooperation, needs
to be embedded into a process of genuine giving and taking thereby
providing advantages for both sides and making nobody a loser.
With regards to the Contill project, the following process was
agreed upon during a joint planning exercise:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Expatriate project staff retires contrary to present project
agreement in favour of short term assignments (back stopping);
<li>Domestic project staff become fully responsible for project
implementation according to a mutually agreed plan of operation
(adjustable through project cycle management);
<li>Direct support to domestic project staff for further postgraduate
studies at the University of Zimbabwe in line with project goals
(thus harmonising work requirements and personal aspirations);
<li>Institutional support of the University of Zimbabwe through
the involvement of overseas scholars;
<li>Local GTZ project administration office provides services with
regards to project finance, staff training, and future project
agreements (decentralisation provides more flexibility in the
implementation of projects).</ul>
<P>
Through the implementation of this process, GTZ will show that
she is serious about building in expatriate redundancy; as should
happen in development cooperation. AGRITEX, on the other hand,
will have a sufficiently strong technical and managerial structure
to provide an enabling environment for her professionals and thus
ensure the sustainability of the project.
<P>
<B>General outlook</B>
<P>
It is clear that the process outlined for the Contill project
is time and location specific with respect to the above proposals.
Therefore, there should be no rigid blueprint for technical cooperation.
However, the process itself can be replicated in any project provided
the domestic conditions are favourable. Apart from a trusted relationship
all that is then required is a mutual readiness to pursue flexible
modes of project implementation. These should allow the management
to incorporate new ideas and adopt new concepts and strategies
for their cooperation when and if required. Surely, the challenge
of a successfully implementated technical cooperation process
is to achieve active, joint, learning-by-doing.

Partnership in Development Cooperation: Editorial</h3>
by <i>Stanley Please</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: pages 2-3</i>
</center>
<hr>
There is widespread agreement that donor financial and technical assistance can only promote
economic and social development if the projects, programmes and policies which it supports are
'owned' by recipient countries. Yet the association in sub-Saharan countries of massive flows of
donor assistance with poor and, in some instances, disastrous economic performance, has led to
the equally widespread call for greater 'accountability' of assistance to legislatures and to
electorates in donor countries. This call is made notwithstanding a recognition that it would
almost inevitably imply greater donor intrusion in recipient countries and therefore a weakened
sense of 'ownership'.
<p>
It is this dilemma and the danger that it will set in motion a vicious downward spiral of aid
effectiveness, that led ECDPM to devote its 1994 Round Table Conference to the subject of
'Partnership in Development Cooperation: Combining Recipient Responsibility with Donor
Accountability.' A full report contains the introductory speech by Louk Box, Director of ECDPM
and the keynote speeches by Simba Makoni, former Secretary General of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and by Jan Cedergren, Deputy Director of the Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA).
<p>
This issue of the Bulletin reproduces papers which were presented by some of the other
participants at the Round Table. They have been selected to provide varying perspectives on the
issue of partnership in development cooperation. They have also been selected on the grounds
that they effectively address the challenge which Louk Box presented to participants in his
introductory speech, namely: "to focus on practical ways to improve partnership taking into
account real life constraints;" and "to provide operational guidance on how to do it better." He
further laid down three preconditions for meeting the challenge: first, there should be "no
taboos" on raising any relevant issue; second, participants should "refrain from defensive
attitudes;" and third, participants should concentrate on "practical and feasible management
approaches."
<p>
Jos&#233; Filipe Fonseca from the Embassy of Guinea Bissau in Brussels captured this spirit
of the Round Table in his contribution. He attributes the failure of partnership to the combination
of the weakness of recipient African countries and the arrogance of donors. However, he
emphasises that the weaknesses he has in mind are not simply the economic and technological
weaknesses of African countries nor even their institutional weaknesses although all of these are
very important. He is more troubled by the moral weaknesses of country leaders. He is equally
troubled by the arrogance of donors who "are always so convinced that only they have the right
ideas." More modesty and a greater willingness by donors to share responsibility for mistake is
essential, he believes, for improving the partnership relationship.

This frank and hard-hitting analysis of the problem by Fonseca set the tone for the whole of the
Round Table discussion. To capture the flavour of these discussions, Fonseca's contribution is
followed by a selection of quotations from the discussions.
<p>
The methodological note by Rogerio Pinto provides a useful guide for moving beyond the mere
repetition of the buzz words commitment and ownership to something more practical. He
emphasises that 'commitment' is simply associated with the "intent of the leadership" whereas
'ownership' is concerned with "the players who will determine implementation." He concludes
that: "you can have commitment without responsible ownership, but you cannot have responsible
ownership without commitment." He presents a brief description of Institutional Environment
Assessment (IEA), a procedure by which ownership can be both assessed and improved. Its
success, however, is dependent on governments being willing to bear the additional costs
involved, and donors being willing to amend their own internal operational procedures.
<p>
The distinction between the roles of political leaders and of technocrats in the policy process is
also emphasised by Derick Brinkerhoff. He is concerned that technocrats treat policy-making
as a "linear process" with an emphasis on "first-best prescriptions" rather than recognising that
it is a "political and interactive process" in which "consensus building around second and third-best solutions is required." From this analysis he outlines a procedure called Implementing
Policy Change (IPC) which USAID has developed in its operations in several countries. As with
Pinto's IEA procedure, IPC is designed to ensure both national commitment and ownership of
policies and programmes and to develop a partnership relationship with donors. He illustrates
the use of IPC by reference to his own practical involvement in its application in Zambia.
<p>
In his introductory speech, Louk Box had asserted that the issues facing the Round Table were
as relevant to NGO's as they were to official multilateral and bilateral donors. Hugh Goyder of
Actionaid acknowledges this in his contribution. In it, he emphasises that while partnership
continues to be the guiding philosophy of NGO's, "most NGO's have faced real difficulties about
making the concept fully operational." The national pressures to be more accountable and to
introduce new concerns over the environment, gender, etc., make it "difficult to be accountable
to the communities with whom we are working." He then presents Actionaid's experience in
facing up to this problem: do not rush into financing but let projects emerge from community
action; appoint local staff living and working in the project area; work through local government
and local communities rather than national governments; do not over-burden field workers with
excessive reporting requirements. From this experience he draws possible lessons for official aid
agencies.
<p>
There were those at the Round Table who were markedly less optimistic about the chances of
reforming the aid relationship towards an improved sense of partnership. They argued that it is
necessary to be less idealistic and more pragmatic; to recognise that the "forces in favour of
inertia within long-standing bureaucratic systems" are strong and pervasive. This quote is from
the contribution by Steven Tabor who drew lessons from experience with donor involvement in
agricultural research. Despite the "largely unchanging needs for new technologies to address
rural poverty and country food requirements," donor involvement has been short-sighted, biassed
towards unsustainable physical facilities, and subject to unnecessary donor-promoted policy
changes. Tabor argues for a much less ambitious approach for the 1990's. This would be an
approach in which particular partnership arrangements are negotiated where "a good fit can be
found between a country's needs and a donor's assistance instruments." Any longer term
partnership relationship would "be more a product of serendipity (i.e. a happy accident) than of
deliberate policy."
<p>
It is clear from all these papers that participants both recognised the importance of the
ownerhsip-accountability dilemma posed by the Round Table and that they had taken seriously
Louk Box's request that they focus on practical conclusions emerging from their experiences. Of
course, there was persistent reference in discussions to the difficulty - some would say
impossibility - of generating anything approaching a partnership of equals when the economic,
technological, professional, institutional and political power of donors and/or recipients is so
unequal.
<p>
SIDA is clearly one of the few donors willing and politically able to explicitly recognise and
address this inequality. Through its 'Changing Roles' policy, SIDA is deliberately attempting to
fashion its strategic and operational relationships with the recipients of its assistance in a manner
which will prevent, or at least mitigate, the adverse impact of this inequality on the ownership
of projects and programmes by the recipients. It recognises that this is risky, but SIDA asserts
that unless ownership is genuinely with the recipient, the risks of failure are even greater.
<p>
But while the SIDA strategy makes eminent sense for partnership relationships between
countries where both the donor and the recipient country place economic and social development
policy high on their list of political priorities, is it relevant to the many other donor and recipient
countries in which - sadly - this is not the case? The Round Table, perhaps understandably, did
not focus on these country differences.
<p>
But what is more worrying is that donors do not differentiate their operational procedures to any
marked extent as they apply to 'good' performers and to 'bad' performing recipient countries. If
the partnership concept is be nurtured, there must be a greater willingness by donors to move
towards the SIDA strategy in their relationships with those countries which are struggling
seriously with their horrendous economic and social problems. These countries should generate
sufficient confidence to permit the ownership of policies to be clearly in the hands of the
government.
<p>
Certainly the high profile conditionalities associated, for instance, with World Bank structural
adjustment lending and with their overtones of domestic economic policy being run from
Washington, are highly undesirable and counter-productive.
<p>
However for other recipient countries, such high profile conditionality might, at least for a
limited period, be very desirable. This would be particularly the case where, after a period of
economic and/or political disaster, there is a need to build up confidence between donors and
recipient countries. Once confidence is established, increasing movement towards partnership
becomes possible and desirable.
<p>
A final reflection on the Round Table returns to the first of the two keynote addresses which
launched the proceedings -- that of Simba Makoni: "Genuine partnership," concluded Makoni,
"will result not just, not even mainly, from good institutions and procedures, but rather from a
clear community of interest, strong political will and commitment, and honesty and sincerity."
Donors on their part must not simply "blame incompetent or corrupt host governments" and, for
their part, these governments "must take their destiny in their hand to determine what help they
need and to say 'no' to that which they do not need."

<P>

<B>Small but excellent - this is how Switzerland likes to present
itself and its development assistance. With barely 1.5 billion
Swiss francs of official development assistance (ODA), it is just
not possible to move mountains. The Swiss do not even try. Rather,
they emphasize quality. Other policy concerns, however, interfere
with this concept, such as their position on flight capital.</B>
<P>
In regard to the terms of its aid, there is no doubt that Switzerland
is one of the most generous donors: Almost 100 percent of all
aid is given in the form of grants (since 1988, bilateral assistance
has consisted exclusively of non repayable grants; no loans are
provided). Assistance is more or less unconditional, and the instruments
are very flexible. Although Switzerland pursues its own foreign
trade interests through mixed financing (8% of ODA, or 1 % of
Third World exports), even the usually faultfinding NGOs acknowledge
that the bulk of assistance is decidedly oriented toward development.
Proof is in the selection of partners, predominantly low income
countries, and the concentration on rural development and food
security.
<P>
<B>Volume of Swiss aid</B>
<P>
In the past, however, the Swiss were not exactly the most generous
donors. Until the end of the eighties, their relative total contributions
were at the lower end of the donor list (in 1970, ODA was only
0.12% of GNP, 1980 only 0.24%). Thanks to high growth rates, the
DAC (Development Assistance Committee) average was met for the
first time in 1991, and again increased to 0.46% in 1992. However,
downward movements are anticipated and it is not very likely that
the goal for 1995 of at least 0.4% will be reached. Despite good
intentions on the part of the government  the federal council
 to increase the volume of development assistance in future years
by 8 per cent annually, parliament  the council of states and
the national council  again applied the budget brake. In view
of its deep economic recession even rich Switzerland must economize.
<P>
At any rate, the Swiss have a bad conscience. This was obvious
during the 700th anniversary celebration of the confederacy in
1991, when 700 million francs in excess of ODA appropriations
were approved for debt relief. (Even commercial banks contributed).
The extremely active NGOs had gone all out with their publicity
campaign and submitted a petition signed by 250 000 Swiss citizens,
which asked the federal assembly to be generous. Furthermore,
creative approaches ensure that the population's willingness to
donate to development projects continues (0.06% of GNP). However,
the social consensus that more needs to be done for the South
quickly comes to a stop when the Swiss economy airs its concerns
as to fair foreign trade, opposition to the bank secrecy act,
or asylum policy. When in doubt, the confederates are in favour
of cautious restraint.

<B>Guidelines of Swiss aid</B>
<P>
Political guidance is provided by the 1976 federal law on international
development cooperation and humanitarian aid. The department for
development assistance (DEH) in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs
operates on this generally accepted basis. It channels approximately
80 per cent of Swiss ODA. In implementing its measures mostly
small projects  the DEH cooperates closely with consulting firms
and NGOs.
<P>
While the image of the DEH is that of a basic needs oriented helper,
the civil servants at the BAWI, the federal agency for foreign
trade, are generally looked upon as representatives of domestic
export interests, which are realized through mixed financing and
balance of payments assistance. For a long time, responsibilities
were clearly separated due to division of labor and dissimilar
lobbies. Recently, these lines have been blurred because of coordination
pressures and personnel changes. The new head of the DEH, Walter
Fust, is a known expert in Swiss trade promotion. Nevertheless,
there can be no question of a general change of direction, since
personnel was also transferred from the DEH to the BAWI. Besides,
the political direction is determined by the cabinet and parliament,
after all.
<P>
Given the relatively low ODA volume and the modest staffing of
development agencies, it is only logical to concentrate assistance
in a few priority countries. About 70 per cent of bilateral assistance
goes to 19 countries where the Swiss work predominantly in regions
and sectors which are not already pervaded by other donors. It
is hardly surprising that the effort to find a niche literally
led to the mountains to develop dairy farming and small industries.
Traditionally, Nepal, Pakistan, Bolivia, Peru, Rwanda, and Madagascar
have been priority countries, where rural projects have been quite
successful.
<P>
Regionally, Swiss aid is increasingly concentrated in Africa (40%),
followed by Asia (30%), and Latin America (12%). Since the nineties,
a small amount of ODA funds has been given to Eastern European
countries for humanitarian purposes (Albania and the former Yugoslavia).
<P>
Sectorally, the Rio Conference on Environment and Development
in 1992 was responsible for a shift in favor of environmental
protection. Environmental impact studies are now required for
all projects. Furthermore, food security, education, handicrafts,
and small industry are preferred project sectors. Following the
trend of other international donors, more attention is devoted
to migration, the war on drugs, and AIDS. Conditionality is openly
supported, which was manifested in the highly selective allocation
of the &quot;anniversary contribution&quot;. Switzerland rewards
efforts on the part of the recipient countries toward &quot;good
governance&quot; (in a rather vague sense) and observance of human
rights, although it is quite aware of its limited leverage.

<B>Organization of Swiss aid</B>
<P>
Both aid agencies are responsible not only for ministerial decisions,
but also for their implementation (the DEH for one third of its
projects). Institutions comparable to the German KfW (Reconstruction
Loan Corporation) or GTZ (German Agency for Technical Cooperation)
have not been established. The higher education sector cooperates
with federal institutions, as for instance the Confederate Technical
University in Z&#252;rich with the Development Institute in Geneva.
Usually, the implementation of projects is subcontracted to consulting
firms and NGOs. This cooperation is facilitated not on only by the
transparent personnel structure but also by the multi year budgets
of the federal council, which are flexible as to spending priorities
and include conditional credits approved by parliament. (Although annual appropriations;
i. e. cash payments, cannot be carried over to the next fiscal
year, a loss of funds is usually avoided by shifting expenditures
between programs).
<P>
Conceptionally, the DEH is fully committed, particularly in regard
to its country programs. The first one was introduced in 1988
for Bangladesh. These programs utilize the findings of regular
evaluations. The goal is to link technical cooperation (of the
DEH) with balance of payments assistance (of the BAWI).
<P>
<B>No country quotas for Swiss aid</B>
<P>
Swiss missions and local coordinating agencies play an active
role in project planing, which makes it unnecessary to adhere
to specific quotas. Countries do not receive general promises
of assistance. Planning is done by sector. Project proposals take
into account local potential sustainability, and help for self help.
In Switzerland, these are more than just slogans that sound good.
<P>
Fast and efficient humanitarian aid is definitely one of Switzerland's
strongest attributes. It builds on the vast experience and professionalism
of the Swiss Disaster Relief Corps. Food aid, on the other hand,
has been very controversial, since the domestic agro lobby has
not been very concerned about its negative impact on the recipient countries. Still, relief
organizations are trying to follow a sensible distribution policy
within the framework of food-for-work projects.
<P>
Relief agencies and other NGOs are quite involved in Swiss development
cooperation. Since 1980, ODA funds for NGOs have quadrupled. It
is no coincidence that the NGOs are better known among the general
public than the public aid agencies. To name only the largest
organizations: The Swiss Red Cross and Caritas provide mainly
humanitarian aid; Helvetas, Swissaid as well as the religious
organizations &quot;Bread For Brothers&quot; and &quot;Fasting
Sacrifice&quot; provide primarily development assistance. The
importance of these NGOs becomes clear when one considers that
they implement about one third of bilateral technical cooperation.
Swissaid, whose international reputation equals Oxfam's, does
not manage any projects, but receives DEH subsidies in the form
&quot;block grants&quot;. Several NGOs have pooled their resources
to solicit donations and publicize their activities, which has
a positive impact on the coordination of aid measures as well.
<P>
<B>Multilateral aid</B>
<P>
Notwithstanding the negative referendum on joining the United
Nations, aid agencies are not averse to working with multilateral
organizations. For many years, Switzerland has contributed cash
and special services to UN institutions, particularly to UNDP
and UNICEF. With its positive vote in 1992 to join the World Bank
group and the IMF, the electorate finally sanctioned this already
well established cooperation (although many NGOs pleaded for a
no vote). Even before joining, Switzerland was allowed to participate
in World Bank tenders, since Washington was very aware of the
great importance of the Swiss credit market. The fact that Switzerland
profited from this relationship as well as from the orders it
obtained was instrumental for the yes vote.
<P>
Aside from such profit calculations, aid agencies feel obligated
to provide multilateral assistance. For example, they co financed
structural adjustment programs and readily participated in IDA
replenishments. Switzerland is also involved with the regional
banks of the IFAD.
<P>
A big question mark remains concerning Switzerland's ties to Europe
after the negative referendum on joining the European Union (EU),
which made it less likely that the desired membership in the EU
would be approved in the near future. Will Switzerland join after
all in the nineties and accept all the rights and obligations
that go with membership? These will probably be more stringent
after the likely entry of all the Nordic nations. Or will Switzerland
continue to go it alone, under the motto &quot;small but excellent?&quot;
<P>
Relative to its affluence and capacity, the development policy
of Switzerland is actually too small and certainly not excellent
in general. Much remains to be desired relevant to trade policy,
since Switzerland is even more protectionist in the agricultural
sector than the EU states. And the Swiss financial world, despite
all its lip service in the wake of the Marcos accounts affair,
does not give any indication that flight capital is returned to
where it is so urgently needed. With all due respect to Swiss
neutrality non partisanship is a questionable attitude in view
of the global conflict situation.

<BR>no. 24, f&eacute;vrier 1997</H3>
<H3>Quest-ce que le FERN?</h3>
FERN (EU Forest Programme of the World Rainforest Movement)<br>
20 Keltenlaan 1040 Brussel, Belgique<br>
Tél: + 32 2 7333653 / Fax: + 32 2 7368054 / E-mail: <A HREF="mailto:spettman@gn.apc.org">spettman@gn.apc.org</A><p>

<p>
La destruction des forêts tropicales est devenue un problème majeur au cours de la dernière décennie. De nombreuses ONG ont étudié ce problème, mais jusquil y a peu, aucune dentre elles nétait active à léchelle de lUE. Etant donné que lUE jouit dune grande influence sur le commerce mondial des produits sylvicoles et quelle représente, avec ses Etats membres, le plus grand donateur des pays dotés de forêts tropicales, le FERN a été créé afin de combler cette lacune.
<p>
Le FERN - qui nest pas un acronyme - a été fondé en 1995 et sest assigné les objectifs suivants:
<UL>
<LI>surveiller les activités de lUE liées à la sylviculture
<LI>développer la coordination entre les ONG en matière sylvicole
<LI>faciliter la contribution dONG précises à léchelle de lUE
</UL>
Le FERN concentre principalement ses travaux sur la politique commerciale et la politique de laide de lUE, en particulier lorsquelle concerne les forêts tropicales, et a établi des liens étroits avec dautres ONG qui travaillent dans le domaine de lenvironnement et du développement.

<H3>Les activités du FERN</H3>

A partir du mois de janvier 1996, le FERN a publié Forest Watch, un bulletin mensuel qui informe un plus large public des activités sylvicoles de lUE. Un groupe de travail forêts de lUE a également été créé et réunit des ONG de différents Etats membres travaillant sur les questions sylvicoles. 
<p>
Dimportants représentants des différents Etats membres se réunissent deux fois par an en compagnie de représentants dONG internationales telles que Greenpeace International, WWF International, World Rainforest Movement et Friends of the Earth.

<H3>Les réalisations</H3>

Le FERN a joué un rôle fondamental dans la discussion pour obtenir que la transparence et le caractère comptable soient bien reflétés dans la réglementation sur la ligne budgétaire forêts tropicales adoptée récemment. En 1996, la contribution du FERN a été capitale pour ladoption de deux résolutions du Parlement concernant le barrage de Bakun en Malaisie et les mines dans lEtat dAmazonas, au Venezuela. Le FERN a également apporté sa contribution à de nombreux débats parlementaires.

<P>
<b>Hardly any other industrial nation has given its development policy
a higher status in its overall foreign policy than Sweden. In
many questions of concept, Sweden has been the opinion leader,
advocating for example a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism
and socialism. The bourgeois government which came to power in
1991 started to change this line and reduced development aid.
Even after the Social Democrats' return to government in 1994,
the old line was not fully restored.</b>
<P>
Sweden has concentrated considerable human and financial resources
on development cooperation since the 1970s and set high benchmarks
of quality for its inputs. In doing so, the country did not aim
at being a model of self sufficient modesty: Sweden's claim to
leadership in quality was above all asserted offensively during
Olof Palme's time as head of government. And in the North south
dialogue the country frequently took stances which deviated decisively
from the mainstream dominated primarily by the USA.
<P>
These efforts to shape a high developmental profile won Sweden
worldwide respect, but not always agreement. Other countries appreciated
the fact that discussions of conceptual issues in Sweden at all
levels political, administrative technical and scientific methodical
were tackled quickly and competently. But the ideological background
of Sweden's development policy, expressed above all in its preference
for socialist models in the Third World, in its partisanship keeping
its distance from the Superpowers for the nonaligned countries
and the Group of 77, and not least in its claim to be &quot;pure&quot;
and free from economic interests, was either viewed critically
or rejected.
<P>
This negative response of other donor nations and the developing
countries excluded from Swedish cooperation could not be explained
solely by the fact that Sweden's orientations also always implied
criticism of other donor and recipient nations. The latter also
suspected that in practice Swedish policy on the South was not
as pure as it was made out to be. Indications and tangible proof
of this cropped up time and again. The Bofors scandal revelations
of deep Swedish involvement in the arms trade with the Third World
was a decisive milestone in this regard. It was also crucial because
it stirred up a great deal of suspicion among the Swedish public
about the model character of Sweden's relations with the South.
<P>
<B>Gradual changes in the Swedish profile </B>
<P>
In the autumn of 1991 a bourgeois government took office in Sweden
which propagated a marked departure from the country's &quot;third
way&quot;. By that it meant not only a fundamental revision of
the capital-labour relationship and social, fiscal and financial
policies, but precisely also a reorientation of foreign policy.
Political slogans such as the &quot;End of International Utopianism&quot;
and the necessary &quot;Europeanization of Foreign Policy&quot;
led people to expect that this reorientation would mean a shifting
of focus at the cost of Stockholm's relations with the South.
True, with the Social Democrats' return to government in 1994
these tendencies were in fact weakened. But they were by no means
reversed.
<P>
What does this mean for Sweden's development policy? Can one expect
Sweden to abandon its established positions? Will it let its high
profile deteriorate? Will Sweden cease to give orientation to
others, and will its function as a model even be reversed? Does
this mean that the current trends in international cooperation,
ranging from stagnation to recession, may even be strongly accelerated
by a change in Swedish development policy?

<P>

<p>

Upfront, one should note that Sweden's claim to be an international
model was not only rhetoric. It really did lead to a high level
of performance in development cooperation. The performance indicators
applied by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) leave
no doubt about that. Since the mid1970s, Sweden has put at least
0.8 per cent of its Gross National Product into development cooperation
as ODA (see Table 1) and thus been a member of the top group of
donors. Its grant element has long been 100 per cent, and this
was not reduced by the introduction of mixed credits at the beginning
of the 1980s (only the interest subsidy is counted as ODA). Traditionally,
Stockholm has taken a relaxed approach to tied aid, and only slightly
less than 20 per cent of bilateral assistance is linked to deliveries.
Because of that the return flow rate is relatively low, which
has drawn continual criticism from the Swedish association of
industries since the 1970s. Sweden reacted early and to a relevantly
great degree to calls for a relaxation of tying funds to specific
projects (by introducing sector programmes, financing imports
and assisting balances of payments). It also did the same in response
to pressure to finance costs in local currencies and fund recurring
costs. Sweden was in the vanguard in introducing country programming,
and on planning security (commitments over several years) and
project design (&quot;recipient orientation&quot;), went a long
way to meeting developing countries' wishes. New directions in
development cooperation the inclusion of NGOs, policy on women,
environmental policy, democracy and human rights were adopted
early in Sweden's developmental programme and implemented consistently.

The Swedish development cooperation administration has long had good prerequisites for a close and continual dialogue with the recipient governments. These are its focus on about 25 main recipient countries, its decentralization
in the form of local representation in those countries, its commitments over several years, and its
programming arrangements. Not least, Swedish development cooperation is
greatly respected due to its multilateral components, which stand out for their
scale and constructive involvement, above all in the UN area. These are the salient
features of the Swedish development cooperation profile. But a closer look at it
shows that it has long manifested signs of latent erosion. The environment for a
development policy which lays claim to international leadership had already
changed in the 1980s. The liberal and con servative parties, and
above all the association of industries, had always opposed
a radical development policy. The ruling Social Democrats took account of this
criticism not only in the sense of political bargaining, but also because of their con viction that development
policy should be based on a broad public consensus. The
most important adjustments made in the past decade (see Table 2) were:
<ul>
<li>limiting the competence and increasing control of the implementing agency SlDA (Swedish International
Development Authority) which was seen even by some Social Democrats as too radical, too highhanded, and inefficient;
<li>limiting the country frameworks (firm multi-year commitments to about 25 main recipients) in favour of sectoral or cross-sectoral programmes which are also open to other recipients;
<li>setting up other organizations and instru ments, above all the BITS organization
for mixed credits and technical aid, especially for cooperation with advanced
developing countries which are also of interest to Swedish industry, including Central and Eastern Europe;
<li>cutting back the share of multilateral ODA, linked with a more critical attitude towards the UN organizations and drawing closer to the World Bank and region al banks.</ul>
<P>
With these systematic and gradual adjustments, the Swedish government and development administration have avoided the abrupt changes which, if they had clung to the radical patterns of the 1970s, would
have been forced on them at the latest by the political changes which emerged
towards the end of the 1980s. With the collapse of the socialist
systems in Eastern Europe and the Third World two crucial reference points of a third,
radical way in Sweden's policy on the South disappeared for good.
And the coincidence of the acceleration of the European integration
process with signs of erosion of the Swedish economic and social
model made resisting a &quot;Europeanization&quot; of Sweden's
foreigns policy untenable.
<P>
<B>No model change but increased pressure to adjust</B> 
<P>
As Social Democratic governments had anticipated the necessary
adjustments to the international environment, there was no reason
for a real development policy change after the switch of government
in 1991. But there were drastic changes in aid volumes and in
disbursements to some of the traditional main recipients. Cuts
were made by the conservative government with the approval of
the Social Democrats which meant that even after the government
changed again in 1994, they could not be reversed. However, the
cutback in volume, part of a severe government restructuring package,
was at 14 per cent relatively mild and left the ODA-GNP rate at
0.9 per cent. But disbursements to individual countries were slashed
drastically. Compared with the inputs of 1990/91, those to Tanzania
plunged by 23 per cent, to Mozambique by 38 per cent, to Vietnam
by 47 per cent, and to Zambia by a swingeing 58 per cent. By contrast,
during the same period other major recipients such as India and
Zimbabwe enjoyed distinct increases. These were clear signals
to the governments of these long-time partner countries.
<P>
But the &quot;losers&quot; will also remain top recipients, even
though the rules of the game had changed. The narrower group of
partners has now been defined by three year country strategy papers
replacing the country programmes elaborated for selected recipients.
Countries covered by these so far are Botswana, Namibia, Sri Lanka,
Tanzania, Vietnam, Zambia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya,
Lesotho, Nicaragua and South Africa.
<P>
Besides these budgetary changes, there are highly detailed approaches
to overhauling the developmental programme and organization. They
feature new priorities for economic growth, new relationships
between the market and government, continuation of the structural
adjustment policy led by the World Bank and IMF, strengthening
of institution building, support for democracy and human rights,
more stringent monitoring of the use of funds by and effectiveness
of Swedish implementing agencies and developing country administrations.
These are all programme points which, although rendered in terms
unusual for the Swedish style of doing things, in fact only signify
accentuations and not real innovations.
<P>
Traditionally, the most important implementing organization by
far was the SIDA, responsible for disbursing a good 50 per cent
of the total funds and about three quarters of the bilateral transfers.
These ratios have remained stable since the mid-1980s. But there
has been a shift within the SIDA budget in the relation between
framework commitments to main recipient countries on the one hand
and other SIDA programmes on the other. This ratio was still 75:25
at the beginning of the 1980s; now it is 60:40 (see Table 2).
The SIDA has also made some changes to its organization and instruments
following pressure from parliament and the government. It assigned
a coordinator for population questions, and appointed senior advisors
for environmental, health and family planning issues. In addition,
the SIDA was told to intensify its monitoring of effectiveness
and spending. This has resulted in the introduction of a target oriented
planning system, a more systematic evaluation, an annual performance
report to the government, and a manual on controlling corruption
in the employment of funds in recipient countries. In terms of
instruments, a further expansion of non-project-tied aid is foreseen.
However, after integrating import financing and assistance with
balances of payments, most of this aid will be allocated outside
the country frameworks.
<P>
Besides the traditionally strongly promoted social sectors (one third
of the SIDA disbursements in 1993/94), the focal points of bilateral
cooperation are to be environmental protection, technical infrastructure,
and promotion of administrative efficiency and democracy. In addition,
disaster aid, with almost one quarter of the disbursements, is
being given an ever more important status in the SlDA's range
of inputs. In 1993/94 third of these funds flowed into European
crisis regions, mainly former Yugoslavia. The SIDA disburses about
10 per cent of its funds via NGOs.
<P>
BITS has competence for technical aid and mixed financing in the
cooperation with the more economically advanced recipient countries.
In addition, since 1995 Sweden has run an experiment in also allocating
ODA credits via BITS with a grant element of 80 per cent. Since
1990, this institution has also had an additional field of activity
in Central and Eastern Europe. About one quarter of Sweden's very
diverse aid for this region, which has meanwhile grown to an annual
volume of 1 billion SEK, is disbursed by BITS to support the change
in the political systems and for environmental protection. (By
definition, these programmes are outside ODA).
<P>
The promotion of Swedish direct investment and transfer of knowhow
by Swedish industrial companies was reorganized before the change
in government. Competence for these programmes now rests with Swedfund
International AB and Swedecorp. The Swedish Agency for Research
Cooperation with Developing Countries (SAREC) which, besides BITS
and Swedfund/Swedecorp, is responsible above all for the cooperation
with non programme countries, remained entrusted with scientific
cooperation. After the change in government in 1994 profound changes
in the organization of Swedish development administration were
once again in the offing. The various implementing organizations
the SIDA, SAREC, BITS and Swedecorp were integrated into one body.
The integration of SlDA's local representations in recipient countries
into the respective Swedish embassies was completed earlier.
<P>
<B>The EU question</B> 
<P>
The developmental dimension of Sweden's entry into the European
Union is also being discussed intensively in Sweden. Linked with
its application for membership, a foreign ministry working group
had analysed these implications together with representatives
of social groups. The ministry's official conclusion was that
EU membership would not demand a significant change of course
in Sweden's development policy. The Swedes regard the EU's development
policy as altogether compatible with their basic line, and hardly
expect any impacts on their bilateral aid. But on the other hand
they have also made it clear that Sweden will want to have a weighty
voice in questions of EU development policy concepts. Hence one
can assume that in the developmental field as well, Sweden's &quot;Europeanization
of foreign policy&quot; will not mean that it will renounce its
salient positions. Especially if its Nordic EU partners, Denmark
and Finland share these positions.

The workers wereaccused of forming a "counter-revolutionary" group, and of organizing twopeaceful demonstrations in Changchun during the pro-democracy movement. InNovember 1990 Tang Yuanjuan, as the alleged leader of the group, was sentenced to20 years' imprisonment. <P>In April 1991 Tang Yuanjuan was transferred to theLingyuan No.2 Labour-Reform Detachment of Liaoning province. He was assigned to aspecial squadron of political prisoners jailed during the crackdown on thepro-democracy movement. At least 13 of these prisoners were reportedly subjectedto torture and ill-treatment during 1991 and 1992. <P>In May 1991 Tang Yuanjuan wasamong 11 political prisoners who were severely beaten for refusing to acknowledgethat they were "criminals". After the beating, Tang Yuanjuan and others weretaken to the "correction" unit. <P>There, these prisoners were stripped naked andrepeatedly given shocks with high voltage electric batons on the head, neck,shoulders, armpits, stomach and the inside of the legs. When the electric batonused against Tang Yuanjuan ran out of power, a guard wearing leather boots kickedhim. Two of his ribs were broken as a result. <P>Similar incidents of tortureoccurred during the following months. The Chinese authorities subsequently deniedthat the prisoners had been tortured and claimed that the allegations had beeninvestigated, but provided no evidence of this. <P>Tang Yuanjuan was diagnosed in1990 as suffering from tuberculosis and hepatitis. His family has repeatedlyappealed to the authorities to release him on bail for medical treatment - -permitted under Chinese law. The authorities have refused. They claim theillnesses he suffers from have "stabilized". However, in early 1995 Tang Yuanjuanwas reportedly complaining of persistent upper abdominal pain. <P>AmnestyInternational is urging the authorities to launch a thorough and impartialjudicial investigation into reports of torture at the Lingyuan No.2 Labour-ReformDetachment. It is also calling for the immediate and unconditional release ofTang Yuanjuan as a prisoner of conscience. <HR><A HREF="china2.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="cchina.gif">Previous page</A><p><hr><a href="../index.html"><img align=bottom src="../amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif"> Amnesty International Home Page</a><br clear=all><hr></BODY></HTML>

<h2>Yes, VSO is not a relief agency sending emergency supplies.</h2>


VSO aims to work in long term sustainable development. Most volunteers go overseas for two years. Teaching and training people in developing countries is what VSO does and this takes time. The need is not simply for another 'pair of hands'.  In reality, without a skill to offer you are just another mouth to feed. Volunteers always use the skills they are trained in. You have to be able to contribute positively.

<CENTER><H3>Address by Mr. Carl B. Greenidge<BR>

Deputy Secretary General of the ACP Group<BR>

at the <A HREF="../liaison/ln17e.htm">1996 General Assembly for European NGOs</A><BR>

Brussels, 18-19 April 1996</H3></CENTER>

<HR>

<P>

Distinguished Guests,

<P>

President Agostinho Jardin Gonzales,

<P>

Honourable Commissioner,

<P>

Ladies and Gentlemen,

<P>

It is a profound honour for me to have the opportunity to address

members of this 22nd General Assembly of the Liaison Committee

of Development NGOs to the E.U. It is also a great pleasure for

me to be able to start by congratulating this Forum for the continuing

interest it and its constituents have shown in the evolution of

ACP-EU relations over the years and in the assiduous and tenacious

manner in which it has worked on this issue and collaborated in

the struggle to negotiate and implement a better and more effective

Convention of Lome.

<P>

The work of NGOs is especially important and welcome in a world

which could be aptly portrayed by Albert Camus' observation that

&quot;too many people have decided to do without generosity in

order to practice charity&quot;. How fitting that quip is in the

world of development aid today.

<P>

Being specially appreciative of the work of the NGOs I am heartened,

although not surprised, to find that the programme for the meeting

includes a Workshop on the Future of the Lome Convention. That

debate is one of many being conducted among and between the Lome

partners. Some of these debates also concern the IGC which will

set the scene for much of Europe's future policies.

<P>

In this regard, I wish to commend the Liaison Committee of European

NGOs for the analysis and recommendations conveyed in the Position

Paper which it presented to the Reflection Group.

<P>

Our own work on the Future of Lome in this area is at a very preliminary

stage but several factors can already command a general consensus.

<P>

The Convention, in spite of its weaknesses, has been of great

benefit to ACP States. They would have been considerably worse

off without it. The financial transfers  and Commodity Protocols

constitute the most obvious testimonies to this assertion.

<P>

In response to a number of changing trends within Europe and elsewhere,

some elements of the Convention will have to be modified after

the year 2000. The Group recognises this and is prepared to contribute

to helping to fashion and implement pertinent modifications which

will help to keep the Convention &quot;alive&quot;.

<P>

Having said that, it also needs to be observed that the ACP Group

is not of the view that the Convention has to be radically re-written

or reconceived. Since there have been assessments of implementation

and constraints to implementation the future Agreement should

adequately reflect these as should the workings of the Institutions

and Organs of the Convention.

<P>

Liberalisation and globalization per se need to be supported by

resources to ACP countries because without it those States with

inadequate infrastructure, low educational levels, inappropriate

technology and limited managerial capacity will find themselves

increasingly marginalised. Poor countries attempting to cope with

liberalised market conditions need to be supported with adequate

levels of aid, technical assistance, improved market access and

debt relief.

<P>

The tendency to declining levels of official aid flows runs contrary

to this imperative. Coherence between aid policy and liberalisation

conditionalities is necessary if inequalities are not to be a

by-product of policies.

<P>

The need for additional aid for those countries such as net food

importers, which are likely to be losers as a result of the Uruguay

Round was recognised in the final report of the GATT. However,

the proposed modality for addressing the problem is far from satisfactory.

One cannot help feeling in this context that Bagehot was right

when he observed that, &quot;poverty is an anomaly to rich people.

It is very difficult to make out why people who want dinner don't

ring the bell&quot;.

<P>

The priorities of the ACP, the  like international trends, will

be changing too. In the light of African experiences since the

1980s there is a growing pre-occupation with food security and

political stability. Mr Chairman, the policies of some EU States

and some of the policies embraced by the EU as members of some

multi-lateral financial institutions have contributed to both

of the foregoing problems.

<P>

And yet in other spheres and at the Community level there has

been a commitment to food security and political stability in

ACP States. There is, in other words, a lack of coherence in some

policies. It is necessary to ensure that development policies

are not always require to give way to strategic and foreign policy

considerations as well as defence industry needs.

<P>

Mr Chairman, the position paper to which I have already made reference

dealt quite appropriately with the problem of human rights and

democracy. I would only wish to endorse the need for the Lome

partners to consider and agree on clear criteria concerning breaches

and consistent rules for tackling those countries infringing the

accepted standards. The rules should seek not merely to penalise

States but to facilitate movement along the broad and complicated,

spectrum of practices representing acceptable behaviour.

<P>

It has been said that &quot;creditors have better memories than

debtors&quot;. When we look at the debate on external indebtedness

it is hard not to conclude that this is the main reason for international

failure to resolve the problem of indebtedness of least developed

countries. In this regard, it is instructive to juxtapose the

EU treatment of debt during the course of the recent Mid-Term

Review of the Lome Convention alongside the plight of ACP debtors

as portrayed by the IBRD/IMF. In the course of the latter's analysis

of debtors they identified 20 States which have unsustainable

or near unsustainable debt burdens. Of those 20 countries classified

as heavily indebted poor countries with such burdens only 2 were

non-ACP.  18 of the 20 countries with unsustainable or nearly

unsustainable debt burdens were ACP States.

<P>

This, I might add, should be considered against a background in

which Africa alone undertook some 8,000 rescheduling between 1980

and 1992.

<P>

Mr Chairman, I believe it was William Blake who contended that,

&quot;one law for the lion and the ox is oppression&quot;. The

weak or specially disadvantaged need, in other words, appropriate

programmes, even in the case of debt.

<P>

Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, the ACP Group recognises the

significance of two related factors in the process of development,

namely the import of investment in trade and growth and the imperative

of competitiveness in international markets. Some ACP countries

have been able to identify and exploit  niche markets and new

product lines thereby expanding their share of trade with the

E.U. This success has enabled some ACP countries to embark on

the diversification of their economies.

<P>

That economic diversification depends on further investment if

it is to be sustainable. If investment in many of our countries

is to be expanded significantly and rapidly foreign, savings will

need to be attracted so as to supplement domestic savings. However,

Europe's investment in ACP has tended to be problematic because

it is generally :

<P>

 i) very narrowly concentrated by country;

<P>

 ii) and by sector and in this regard usually focuses on the supply

of raw materials such a soil; and is

<P>

 iii) not attracted to the production of manufactured and processed

goods especially if they are directed at the EU market.

<P>

This brings us back to the issue of coherence : at one level in

the Convention there is a very wide range of  instruments for

facilitating investment; at the private level there is concentration

of investment, which further accentuates differentiation among

the poor countries. Yet EU policy is supposed to have a poverty

focus.

<P>

At the same time some States are seeking to reclaim aid policies

for national governments. Many national aid policies are increasingly

concerned to channel aid to regions and countries where trade

(meaning export) prospects are greatest and where returns on investment

is most lucrative.

<P>

Again the result is to channel resources to the few areas where

resources are already flowing and to further marginalise those

without.

<P>

It would seem then, Mr Chairman, that these are six of the areas

in which improvements can be effected in EU policies so as to

be of benefit to ACP States.

<P>

We hope that with the support and understanding of the NGOs the

importance of these points can be brought to bear on the EU so

that the necessary changes can be effected.

<P>

Like the famous beer adverstisement, NGOs are in a position &quot;to

reach parts which others cannot reach&quot;. We have had over

the last 20 years dramatic evidence not only of how effective

NGOs can be in both informing and influencing public opinion in

donor countries but in dragging unwilling governments to fashion

and implement policies. The best examples have been in the field

of humanitarian aid and disaster relief.

<P>

That capacity of the NGOs to influence opinion in donor countries

is to date employed in only a limited way to influence opinion

on aid ideology. The potential is there to help stem the tide

of so-called aid fatigue.

<P>

Mr Chairman, latterly the role and significance of NGOs have enjoyed

an enormous boost as a result of new thinking in aid ideology.

The latter recognises the virtue of other partners in civil society

and places great weight on the desirability of NGOs as a channel

for assistance to developing countries. This trend, which almost

constitutes euphoria, is evident if one looks at the financial

resources flowing to NGOs. In recent years NGOs involved in international

emergency relief  received some us $ 8 b. Annually. Through these

NGOs, funds were channeled to some 300 million victims. In 1995

relief agencies bought more than 7,000 vehicles and chartered

over 500 ships and 1,000 aircraft. In 1995, there were an estimated

165 NGOs attempting to operate in Kigali alone. When one realises

just how much political power such resources places in the hands

of a few hundred individuals it is sobering. Few commercial enterprises

have control over such a large quantum of resources.

<P>

Yet, in the words of World Aid, &quot;few business of this size

are run as incoherently&quot;.

<P>

NGOs therefore need to put their houses in order. Chaotic rivalry,

lack of coordination, the absence of enforceable rules and supervision,

all threaten their viability.

<P>

I do not propose to dilate on these problems or pitfalls here

Mr Chairman; many are well-known especially after the dramatic

events surrounding the  case of Rwanda. Suffice it for me to urge

that NGOs seek to bear in mind the following points. I trust that

you will not find these observations presumptious, Mr Chairman,

they are intended to facilitate good organisational relations

:

<P>

 i) NGOs are not substitutes for governments. If conflict with

recipient governments is to be avoided and tensions minimised

there is virtue in recognising a division of labour between NGOs

and governments. That division of labour should be informed by

the fact that governments have a mandate to an electorate or a

constituency other than that of the ngo, in the recipient country;

<P>

 ii) NGO &quot;agendas&quot; should be generally non-political

and politically non-partisan in sensitive situations or those

characterised by conflict so that their activities may be most

effective;

<P>

 iii) NGOs should not try to manage their activities without respecting

some basic principles about organisational management  including

the deployment of  qualified/experienced/appropriate human resources.

If they are to survive  the euphoria phase therefore they should

avoid biting off more than they can chew however tempting the

prospect of more responsibilities and easy resources may be. Be

modest in your ambitions.

<P>

Mr Chairman, Honourable Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, please

allow me in closing to once more express my sincere wishes for

fruitful deliberations during the 22nd General Assembly.

<P>

I thank you.

<b><li>Small Business in Transition Economies</b><br>
<b>Promoting enterprise in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union </b><br>
<i>Edited by Jacob Levitsky</i><br>
With the collapse of the communist central planning regimes throughout Eastern
and Central Europe and the vast areas of the former Soviet Union, there has
been a trend towards building up a significant private sector and encouraging
dynamic growth in the emerging markets of national economies. The donor
agencies have responded by developing aid programmes to help in the creation
of a strong private sector and more specifically to help in the development of
small and medium enterprises (SME). Venture capital investment, loan guarantee
funds, business innovation centres, technical exchange visits and regional
trade fairs are being set up in a region of the world where banking and
marketing facilities are more often in short supply than technical
sophistication.<p>

This book looks at some of the experiences of SME projects carried out in the
various countries in the region. Four themes considered of central importance
to SME development -financial support, technical and management services,
favourable policies conducive to SME development and the involvement of
international donor agencies - are examined. These themes are illustrated
through case study material presented at a major international conference in
Budapest. These case studies describe and share the experiences of
organizations and individuals involved first-hand in all aspects of small and
medium enterprise development. <br>

<b><li>Export Marketing for a Small Handicraft Business (second
edition)</b><br>
<i>Edward Millard</i><br>
Small-scale handicraft producers often lack adequate marketing experience or
support structures, particularly for exporting. Written in plain, jargon-free
language, this book provides vital information to help producers export more
effectively. Keeping the perspective and situation of small-scale handicraft
exporters in mind, it covers many aspects of exporting: how to reach and
maintain contact with customers, designing and production for overseas
markets, presentation and packaging, quality control, supplying to
specification, and the various formalities and documentation involved in
exporting. First published in 1992, the book has been extensively revised and
updated for this new edition.<br>

<b><li>Road Maintenance and Regravelling using Labour-Based Methods
(ROMAR)</b><br>
<b>Handbook and Workbook</b><br>
<i>Claes-Axel Andersson, Andreas Beusch and Derek Miles</i><br>
Written for the owners or managers of small construction businesses, the ROMAR
books provide both the management and technical advice needed in order to make
a success of routine maintenance and regravelling as a business activity. The
handbook and workbook can be used together by reading the chapter in the
handbook and then working through the examples in the workbook.<p>

The first part of the books deal with the principles and include the
following: a summary of technical considerations and engineering standards for
earth and gravel roads, and introduction to choosing appropriate road
construction and maintenance technology, soil mechanics, equipment and the
major operations in a typical labour based road projects using a case study of
one of the most successful labour-based road programmes in Africa.<p>

The second part looks at putting those principles into practice - how roads
deteriorate and how to manage maintenance contracts, how to carry out
regravelling projects, pricing and bidding for road maintenance contracts and
how to build up detailed prices for a bill of quantities. With particular
reference to labour-based projects, advice is included on how to manage
people, covering team building, communication, training, motivation,
incentives and how to ensure good discipline and morale. <br>

<b><li>Women in Micro and Small-Scale Enterprise Development</b><br>
<i>Edited by Louise Dignard and Jose Havet</i><br>


This book brings together contributions from both practitioners

and researchers in the field of women in micro- and small-scale

enterprises (WMSEs), in order to provide a detailed analysis of

current knowledge, and guidelines towards improved practice.  



Women's role in enterprise development is now acknowledged as

crucial, and a sense of urgency seems to beset all practitioners

in the field.  However, this eagerness in the sphere of practice

has not been matched by equal efforts in research, so there is

a danger that entrenched positions on good practice are adopted

without research evidence being available to support them. 

Policy prescriptions and programme implementations may therefore

be based on narrow and partial evidence.



The book presents the complexity of women's situations in WMSEs,

and the importance of the issues being addressed and will thus

be useful to all those working in the field of small enterprise

development.<br>

<b><li>The Multilateral Development Banks</b><br>

The multilateral banks are powerful forces in the international

community, providing loans of more than $250 billion to

developing countries over the last half-century.  The best-known

of these, the World Bank, has been studied extensively, but the

'regional development banks' are little understood, even within

their own geographic regions. Drawing on case studies, the

authors respond to some basic questions: have the regional

development banks in fact been effective agents of development? 

Have they been mere clones of the World Bank, susceptible to that

agency's weaknesses, as well as its strengths?  The authors also

assess each institution's ability to take on the emerging

challenges of the development agenda, including such issues as

governance, military spending, and the need for gender-sensitive

development strategies.

It is small in comparison with the two development banks above

it - the Inter-American Development and the World Bank - but some

of the advantages of smallness, as well as the proximity to and

continuity of relations with the partner countries are

demonstrated in this study.<br>

<b><li>Solar Energy for Rural Communities<br>
The case of Namibia</b> <br>
 <i>Gil Yaron, Tani Forbes Irving, Sven Jansson</i><br>
In Namibia, as in many developing countries, a high proportion of rural
communities lack access to the national electricity grid. A major reason for
this is the fundamental problem of providing a service which cannot recover
its costs to areas of low population density. <p>

Yet rural households, small businesses, school and clinics have energy needs
which are not currently being met. Where traditional forms of energy supply
are used, such as wood burning, there have been increasing problems of
environmental degradation. <p> 

Little use has been made of solar energy to meet the needs of rural
communities. This book investigates the potential for photovoltaic and, to a
lesser extent, other solar energy technologies to meet these energy needs. In
order to do this the authors investigate issues such as the impact on rural
development economic viability and consumer willingness to pay, social
acceptance, and technical performance of alternative solar energy options.
Namibia is the focus of attention here, but the methodology adopted and a
detailed review of international experience make this book relevant to all
those interested in solar energy for developing countries.<br>

<b><li>The Cutting Edge: Small Business and Progress</b><br>
<i>Ernst A. Brugger, Jane Nelson and Lloyd Timberlake</i><br>
The text is divided into three main parts: the first introduces small
businesses and discusses their role in achieving sustainable development, the
second focuses on assistance for small businesses and the final section
discusses their role in future development.  The points made in the text are
complemented by many short accounts of individual companies
and entrepreneurs drawn from countries throughout Latin America.  This book
includes texts in Spanish and English and is illustrated with many
photographs.<p>
  
The first section argues that small is not beautiful and that small businesses
are often environmental polluters.  However they are significant players
within the development process and, therefore, need to be encouraged and
supported.  Small businesses within both the formal and informal sectors are
responsible for a large proportion of GDP and an
estimated  30-40 per cent of employment in Latin America.  The authors argue
that successful small businesses are an essential component of local economic
growth and that their increased prosperity will assist and offer opportunities
for those on low incomes in the surrounding area.<p>

 However, small businesses face a number of problems, in particular a lack
of access to credit and to technology and expertise, and the fact that
government rules and procedures favour larger companies.  These problems are
discussed and illustrated in the second section.  The final section discusses
the importance of securing investment in small
businesses in order to effectively reduce poverty within Latin America.<br>

<b><li>The Flexible Economy<br>
The Causes and Consequences of the Adaptability of National Economies
</b></b><br>
<i>Edited by Tony Killick</i><br>
The accelerating pace of global change demands that economies must be 
adaptable.
Economies which are flexible flourish, as in Eastern Asia. Inflexible 
economies stagnate, as in communist Eastern Europe and Africa. However, even
though adaptability governs the long-term development of economies, economists
have had little to say  about the nature and
determinants of economic flexibility. This book redresses that 
situation. The contributors address the key theoretical and empirical issues,
using a wide range of country studies. <br>

<b>ODI Special Report </b><br>
<b><li>Crisis or Transition in Foreign Aid? </b><br>
<i>Edited by Adrian P Hewitt </i><br>
Has the end of the Cold War caused a crisis in official aid, already 
beset by budgetary cuts, challenges on effectiveness and so called 'donor
fatigue'? Or is the problem specific to a few
donors, while others move ahead with more constructive policies, 
stronger and broader-based public support, and larger programmes? This Special
Report assesses the current position in ten of the leading donor countries
(UK, USA, Canada, Japan, France, 
Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark) and looks to the future role
of foreign aid.  <br>

<li>IMF Programmes in Developing Countries Design and Impact</b><br>
<i>Tony Killick </i><br>
Do IMF policies help Developing Countries? As linchpin of the global 
financial system, the International Monetary Fund provides balance of payments
support, chiefly to developing
countries, conditional on strict remedial policy measures. Its approach to
policy remains highly controversial, however. While the Fund claims it has
adapted, critics allege its policies are harshly doctrinaire, imposing
hardships on already poor people.  For the critics, the half-century of its
existence is 'fifty years too long' and radical change is essential. This book
examines the arguments, tracing the extent of Fund adaptation, presenting
major new evidence on the consequences of Fund programmes, and considering its
future role. <br>

<li>IMF Lending to Developing Countries Issues and Evidence </b><br>
<i>Graham Bird, University of Surrey</i><br> 
The International Monetary Fund was created to centralise the 
management of the global monetary system. As international financial markets
evolved, the richer countries turned to other, more flexible sources of
finance and IMF lending became almost exclusively focused
on the developing world. And yet the IMF has been widely criticised 
for its lending role in developing countries, with some arguing that it should
not be lending to all and others claiming that net reverse flows since the mid
1980s suggest that the Fund has abrogated its
responsibilities. This book provides the first detailed theoretical 
and empirical analysis of Fund lending and concludes that key changes are
needed if the Fund is to realise its full potential for assisting developing
countries. <br>

<b><li>Monetary Policy in Developing Countries </b><br>
<i>Sheila Page </i><br>
In this, the first book to analyse the interaction between monetary 
policy, the financial sector and the rest of the economy in developing
countries, case studies of three African and three Asian countries are
complemented by special studies of the role of the informal sector and
the relationship between monetary policy and exchange rate management. 
Country studies include statistical background on the economies and their
financial sectors, and use econometric tests to establish what stable
relationships can be assumed in the financial sector. <br>

<b><li>The Adaptive Economy</b><br>
<i>Tony Killick</i><br> 
All economies need to adapt if they are to achieve reasonable rates 
of development. This book analyses the principles of adjustment policy, with
special reference to small low-income countries. Subjects covered include:
relationships between economic development and
structural flexibility; determinants of economic flexibility; 
strategies and principles of adjustment policy; the socio-economic context of
adjustment policies; the use of the exchange rate; adjustment in agriculture
and industry; and policies for financial sector adjustment. <br>

<b>ODI Special Report <br>
<li>Africa's Multilateral Debt, A Modest Proposal</b><br>
<i>All Party Group on Overseas Development </i><br>
Many African countries now see the lending policies of the World Bank 
and the IMF as an impediment to development rather than a help. What is the
truth behind this perception?
Should the international financial institutions now reverse their 
policy of refusing to reschedule or write off bad debts? Are our own
governments bailing out the IMF and the World Bank with scarce bilateral aid
to keep debts current and if so should the donors be prepared to continue? The
Working Party has drawn up a framework of 
recommendations after meeting representatives of all points of view   banks,
creditor and debtor governments, as well as the international financial
institutions and independent experts. <br>

<b><li>How Developing  Countries Trade: The Institutional Constraints </b><br>
<i>Sheila Page </i><br>
Over the last fifteen years there have been dramatic increases in 
both private and public intervention in international trade. Traditional
barriers to market-based trade such as commodity cartels and tariffs have been
augmented by new developments such as the rise of regional trade blocs and the
growth of intra-firm trade. This book argues that these changes are large and
persistent enough to have an impact on total 
development performance, and on the performance of both individual countries
and sectors. It illustrates this with a wealth of theoretical arguments,
empirical evidence and country studies.<br>

<b>ODI Special Report<br>
<li>World Trade Reform: Do Developing Countries Gain or Lose?</b><br>
<i>Sheila Page and Michael Davenport </i><br>
The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations reduced barriers to trade in 
all economic sectors, with the largest changes in  food and clothing. An
unprecedented number of activities and government policies related to trade
will come under international regulation for the first time, as the move from
GATT to the World Trade Organization creates a new 
institution with stronger powers as well as wider responsibilities. For the
developing countries the effects of this new international framework are
increased because their special privileges are defined more precisely, but
also more narrowly. Estimates of the consequences have varied from
massive gains to crippling losses. <p>

This Special Report analyses the 
changes and where possible quantifies them. It sets out their impact on a
range of countries at different stages of development. Finally it considers
how the new trading system may need to evolve to meet its increasing
responsibilities. <br>

 Environmental Recovery in Kenya </b><br>
<i>Mary Tiffen, Michael Mortimore and Francis Gichuki </i><br>
Pessimism about population growth and environmental deterioration is 
not borne out by transformation of the semi-arid Machakos District, Kenya.
This area was characterised by soil erosion and frequent food shortages
between 1930 and 1960, but had greatly improved by 1990. Combining the
findings of physical and social scientists from ODI and the University of
Nairobi, Kenya, this study uses conventional data, oral history and the
photographic record from 1937. It concludes with an explanation of the
contribution of population growth to economic and social development,
technology change and environmental sustainability under the right policy
conditions, highlighting the role of investment by 
small farmers. <br>

<b><li>Microfinance and Poverty Reduction</b><br>
<i>Susan Johnson and Ben Rogaly</i><br>
Small scale financial services, such as savings and credit facilities, are increasingly seen 
as effective means of poverty reduction. Microfinance and Poverty Reduction, a 
new book published by Oxfam in conjunction with ACTIONAID, examines the 
successes and pitfalls of such schemes across the globe and the lessons learnt, 
promoting debate around the issue.

<P>The book will be launched at the Microcredit Summit, Washington on 3 February. The 
panel of speakers at the launch will include the authors; Tom Dichter, independent 
microcredit expert, and Alfonso Castillo from URAC, Mexico. It will be chaired by 
Nigel Twose, Programme Development Director, ACTIONAID.

<P>Although  microfinance can increase incomes and contribute to household and 
individual security, the authors emphasise that credit is not a panacea for eradicating 
poverty. The continuing debate about the issue and different approaches are 
highlighted in case studies from the UK, Mexico, Pakistan, Ecuador and The Gambia.       

<P>The book recommends an overall approach to deciding whether, and in what ways, 
small scale financial interventions can be useful and relevant to poor people in different 
contexts.  <br>

<b><li>NGO Performance and Accountability<br>
Beyond the magic bullet</b><br>
NGOs are the main agents of relief in developing countries and the channel
through which much foreign aid is spent. This book follows on from the
original study by Edwards and Hulme on maximising NGO's effectiveness (Making
a Difference).   It examines how NGOs demonstrate and account for their
successes and failures. It makes a critical evaluation of the performance of
NGOs in third world development and proposes a range of alternative methods
and approaches to increase their effectiveness. The book argues that many NGOs
are fundamentally weak in this area and  that unless performance is improved,
confidence in their ability to deliver aid efficiently will be eroded.<br>

<b><li>The Advance of African Capital<br>
The Growth of Nigerian Private Enterprise</b><br> 
<i>Tom Forrest</i><br>
The Advance of African Capital provides the most detailed, most extensive
account of medium- and large-scale African business yet published. Up-to-date
and comprehensive, it examines the growth of private enterprise in Nigeria,
giving profiles of the country's key entrepreneurs. Combining ethnographic and
historical perspectives, it examines the strategies and patterns of
development employed by business people from the colonial period to the
present day. Through a series of highly readable case studies, it builds up a
broad picture of the various forms of capital accumulation and sectoral
advances in trade, transport, manufacture, agriculture, finance, and other
services, setting them all within the context of changing economic
opportunities, shifts in power and policy, relations with foreign capital, and
attitudes towards private business and the state. Not only an invaluable
digest of Nigeria's business activity, this important study also challenges
existing views about African enterprise and is highly relevant to
policy-makers concerned with economic development.<br>

<b><li>Ranching and Enterprise in Eastern Botswana<br>
 A Case Study of Black and White Farmers</b><br>
<i>Isaac Ncube Mazonde</i><br>
Botswana's economic development has been extraordinary in Third World terms,
yet little is known about how different social groups have adapted to the new
economic opportunities. This comprehensive account studies a key group of the
new entrepreneurs: the ranchers. It describes their changing life styles,
their construction of personal and social space, and the way they have adapted
to state-initiated political and economic change, showing through a series of
case studies how ranching has grown from being the preserve of white settlers
to include Botswana and other African farmers as well. The relationship
between ranching and communal land tenure, and the effect of Botswana's Tribal
Land Grazing Policy are analysed in detail, while the careers of non-elites,
the practice of bordermanship, labour relations and the management of multiple
enterprises and risks are also covered. This book will appeal to Africanists,
development planners, historians and anthropologists.

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID began working in Sierra Leone in 1988. Programmes in two development areas are now
reaching more than 80,000 people. 

<p>In Kambia ACTIONAID has been working through village groups to reduce poverty by providing seed
credit to farmers, improving access to clean water and environmental sanitation and rehabilitating
schools. In Sella Limba work has focused on improving food security by helping farmers with seed
credit and agricultural training.

<p>The rebel war has devastated Sierra Leone's economy, disrupted community life and affected the
livelihoods of most people. As a result, while ACTIONAID is working on long-term development goals
with communities in these two areas, this is necessarily combined with emergency and rehabilitation
work as the situation demands.

<h3>Examples of ACTIONAID's work In Sierra Leone</h3>
<b>ACTIONAID:</b>

<p><ul><li>worked with communities in Kambia and Sella Limba in digging new wells and rehabilitating
old ones so that 59 villages now have wells and pumps, and two trained well-caretakers for each
village. Adequate sanitation is also important for the communities' good health. More than 3,000
people now have latrines in their homes.

<p><li>is making seed available to farmers on credit to ensure that even following a poor harvest
they have some to plant for the next season. Advice is also provided on improving land management for
better soil conservation. The building of safe seed stores means families no longer have to sleep on
their crop to protect it from pests and thieves.  

<p><li>concentrated on increasing communities' capacity to organise themselves and take complete
responsibility for development initiatives. In 1995 there was a marked increase in these initiatives
with communities managing construction of schools, arranging payment of teachers' salaries and
building literacy centres with little or no direct input from ACTIONAID. During 1996, the seed credit
programme is being handed over to community management.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. EU COUNCIL CALLS FOR CEASE-FIRE IN ZAIRE AND

EXPRESS CONCERN OVER RWANDA AND BURUNDI</FONT></B>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The EU General Affairs

Council last Monday 20 January launched an appeal to all parties

involved in the fighting in Eastern Zaire to declare a cease-fire

and, most importantly, keep it. The Council confirmed in its conclusions,

the need to respect Zaire's territorial integrity as well as those

of other countries in the region and its support to the mediation

efforts being undertaken by African leaders. The Council also

welcomed the confirmation from Zairian authorities that elections

will be held this July, called for the EU electoral unit to be

speedily set in place in Kinshasa and for the prompt appointment

of the head of the Unit. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> On Rwanda, the Council confirmed the EU's willingness

to help reintegrate the remaining refugees but said it was shocked

by the assassination of three Spanish volunteers working in humanitarian

organisations in Rwanda (see below). Concern was also expressed

over the 'serious degradation of the political climate in Burundi'

and the EU called for all parties involved to rapidly begin negotiations

to reach a 'lasting institutional consensus'. The Council concluded

by stressing the urgency of the need to hold an international

conference in the region under the aegis of the United Nations

and the OAU. <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. MRS BONINO SUPPORTS NGOS DECISION TO EVACUATE

THE RUHENGERI AND GISENYI AREAS AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF THREE

SPANISH VOLUNTEERS</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid,

 Mrs Emma Bonino, last week lent her support to the NGOs and international

humanitarian organisation's decision to evacuate the Ruhengeri

and Gisenyi areas. The decision was taken after the assassination

of three Spanish volunteers in the area. Manuel Madrazo Osuna,

Flores Sirera Fortuny and Luis Valtuena Gallego had been working

for Medicos del Mundo on a project financed by the European Community

Humanitarian Aid Office, ECHO. Mrs Bonino described the NGOs'

decision as 'inevitable' and stated, &quot;This sudden worsening

of the security situation also within Rwanda causes the greatest

concern and requires the international community to make a rapid

decision. ... No assistance to the population can be envisaged

without adequate protection.&quot; </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Later in a debate on the issue at the European Parliament,

opened by Spanish MEP Carnero Gonzalez, the new chair of the Parliament's

Foreign Affairs Committee (see below), British MEP Tom Spencer,

said everything had to be done to protect the staff of humanitarian

organisations on the ground. He said that the issue had to addressed

urgently by the authorities in the host countries as well as by

the representatives in the international community.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTS  NEW MEMBERS FOR

ITS COMMITTEES</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The re-forming of Committees in the European Parliament

began in earnest last week. Several of the Committees will retain

the same chairperson such as: </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>- the Committee on Budgets chaired by Detlev Samland,

German Social Democrat; </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>- the Committee on Women's Rights chaired by Nel

van Dijk, Greens, Netherlands; and </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>- the Committee on Budgetary Control chaired by German

Christian Democrat Diemut Theato. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Among the Committees that have chosen new chairpersons

are: </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>- the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and

Defence Policy where British Conservative Tom Spencer replaces

Gerardo Fernandez-Albor of the Spanish EPP Group; </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>- the Committee on External Economic Relations where

Luciana Castellina, Italian member of European United left Group

succeeds Belgian Liberal Willy De Clerq and;</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>- the Committee on Development and Co-operation where

French Socialist Michel Rocard takes over from Bernard Kouchner

who has joined the European Radical Alliance Group. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>British Conservative Lord Plumb should remain chairman

of the European Delegation at the ACP/EU Parity Assembly.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> By the end of last week only two of the groupings

had not been formed. These were:</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>- the Security and Disarmament Sub-Committee where

Dutch Liberal Jan Bertens is expected to keep his position as

chairman and; </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>-the Human Rights Sub-Committee of which French EPP

member Andr&eacute; Soulier is likely to succeed German Christian

Democrat Marlene Lenz. <B> </B></FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EC OFFICIAL CONFIDENT ON EVE OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS

WITH SOUTH                                 AFRICA</FONT></B>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Mr Philippe Soubestre,

the Interim Director of the European Commission's Directorate

General for Development Co-operation and chief EU negotiator in

the EU's trade talks with South Africa expressed his optimism

on the outcome of the talks just before he left for Pretoria last

Thursday. Mr Soubestre denying being disappointed over the slow

pace of progress said, &quot;The sooner the agreement is concluded

the better, but some aspects must be examined meticulously, notably

those affecting South Africa's neighbours.&quot; Mr Soubestre

declared, &quot;The two parties are now prepared to negotiate

and to create the climate of confidence needed to make progress

towards the common objective of a balanced agreement.&quot;</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Mr Soubestre described the EU's proposal of the

free trade area with South Africa as 'the best compromise possible

between the will to conclude an ambitious agreement going beyond

the GSP and the necessity of reconciling in the best way possible

South Africa's interest, the Union's internal constraints and

respect for WTO rules'. He added that South Africa also stood

to benefit from 'qualified accession' to the Lom&eacute; Convention

and that the European Programme for reconstruction and development

in South Africa has a substantial budget (500 million ECU for

1996-2000).</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Mr Soubestre's optimism sharply contrasts reports

of the South African government's misgivings on the agreement.

<P>

<B>1. <I>EUROSTEP </I>FISHERIES CAMPAIGN</B> 

<P>

The Eurostep fisheries campaign was officially launched on 28

May with a very successful demonstration in front of the Council.

The Senegalese delegation, with representatives from Novib and

the Eurostep Secretariat, met the Italian Chairman of the Development

Council, spoke in front of the Development Committee at the European

Parliament, and met MEPs and officials from the DGXIV and DGVIII.

They presented their case as well as the report of a study on

the EU Fisheries policy with the West African countries, particularly

Senegal.

<P>

<B>2. FISHERIES</B> 

<P>

The European Commission is calling for a 40% reduction in fishing

activity in the Northwest Atlantic where certain fish stocks risk

being completely exhausted. The Commission has identified five

categories of fishing, one of which contain the concluded agreements

on stocks. These involve resources in third country and international

waters (beyond 200-mile limit).

<P>

<B>3. DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL - 28 MAY</B> 

<P>

The Development Council under the Presidency of Mr. Rino Serri,

Italian Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, adopted a settlement

and three common positions, UK blocking of conclusions or political

resolutions.

<UL>

<LI>The Council formally adopted the regulation on humanitarian

aid. This will provide a legal base for the activities of ECHO

which have developed to a very large extent (about MECU 750 in

1995). It also assigns clear objectives and general criteria for

humanitarian aid. It sets the procedures for implementation of

humanitarian actions conducted in co-operation with NGOs and aid

programmes financed by the Community.

<LI>The Council approved its &quot;common positions&quot; on the

3 regulations from &quot;Latin American and Asian LDCs&quot;,

&quot;fight against AIDS&quot; and &quot;environment and sustainable

development&quot;. For these three items, the UK delegation did

not bring into play its reserve in principle, arguing that the

qualified majority applied (in reality unanimity was required,

the Council having amended the Commission proposal on the controversial

item of comitology, without its agreement).

<LI>Links between emergency aid, aid to rehabilitation and long-term

development. A broad consensus was reached on the need for a link

between these three aspects of development aid which presupposes

that NGOs be involved in development action, even beyond emergency

situations.

<LI>Environmental impact assessment of development projects and

programmes. The Council held a political discussion on this subject

but did not adopt a resolution

<LI>Follow-up to Horizon 2000 resolution. The Council discussed:

a) operation coordination in the light of experience gained on

the ground, without adopting conclusions, still because of British

reservations. b) coherence between development policy and the

other Community policies at the request of the Danish delegation.

<LI>Decentralised cooperation. The Council held a discussion and

will approve conclusions as soon as possible.

<LI>Migration and development. The Council discussed the links

between certain forms of assistance to poor countries and the

increase in migratory flows.

<LI>Conflict prevention in Africa. The Council showed itself to

be largely in favour of the Commission's approach that recommends

an overall and voluntarist approach that integrates early prevention

of violent conflicts in the EU's policy for development cooperation.

</UL>



<P>

<B>The Great Lakes Region; the chocolate directive</B> 

<P>

During lunch, the ministers discussed the situation in the African

Great Lakes Region in order to draw up a first report. They expressed

their concern - notably about the situation in Burundi - and welcomed

the work accomplished by EU envoy, Mr. Ajello, whose mandate will

certainly be extended. They also expressed their support for UN

and OAU initiatives in favour of peace, and stressed that the

Union is willing to give maximum aid (whether emergency aid or

participation in reconstruction effort after peace is restored).

The cease-fire in Burundi and the creation of a control mechanism

for the movement of weapons remain, however, in the minister's

opinion, essential conditions for national reconciliation, the

establishment of lasting peace and the deployment of effective

humanitarian aid.

<P>

At the request of different delegations, the Council also tackled

the question of modifying the chocolate directive. Belgium, supported

by France, Spain and the Netherlands, stressed the need to take

into account the interests of LDC cocoa producers.

<P>

<B>4. GREAT LAKES REGION</B> 

<P>

European Commission President, Jacques Santer, and Development

Commissioner, Joao de Deus Pinheiro met former United States President

Jimmy Carter in Brussels for an exchange of views on the situation

in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Mr. Carter explained his

initiative aiming to bring about a negotiated settlement of the

conflicts in the region and said he would continue to work to

make the EU more directly involved in the peace process. The goal

is to organise a summit of the Heads of State of Rwanda, Burundi,

Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire with the participation of the EU, the

UN and the OAU. He also launched the idea of establishing a demilitarised

zone in Zaire along the border with Burundi and Rwanda to help

combat arms trafficking and to accelerate the return of refugees.

President Mobutu recently showed a positive interest in the idea.

<P>

<B>5. BURMA</B> 

<P>

The question of Burma was raised at the Development Committee

of the EP by Mrs Kinnock, PES,UK on 28 May. A representative for

the Commission said that despite the problematic incidents that

have occurred in Burma, the European Union would not break its

dialogue with the country. On the contrary, his feeling was that

the European Union would increase the dialogue with Burma as it

did after Tiananmen with China. Mrs Kinnock replied that this

was not necessarily the best example to give.

<P>

As far as economic sanctions were concerned, the representative

of the Commission doubted whether it was a good idea and questioned

whether all 15 countries of the Union would agree on that point.

<P>

On 30 May Mrs Kinnock asked for the situation in Burma to be discussed

at the meeting of the Development Committee in July (22-24 July)

for two or three hours.

<P>

It was agreed it would be one of the items on the agenda.

<P>

The British government has vetoed the EU statement on current

events in Burma. Contrary to statements from Dutch government

officials over last week-end, the blocked statement was not published

last Friday in Rome. The European Union has therefore not commented

on the crisis in Burma. Great Britain has come with its own statement,

followed by Germany and Denmark.

  <h1> CHINA-DENG OBITUARY: The Long March is Finally Over </h1>

<ADDRESS>   By IPS Correspondents </ADDRESS>
<strong>BEIJING, Feb 20 (IPS) - China's last imperial dynasty had not yet  
fallen when Deng Xiaoping was born in 1904.  </strong><P>
   But the country had already flirted briefly with Western-style  
modernisation with the 100-days reforms of 1898. The reigning  
Empress Dowager was then determined not to let Western-oriented  
intellectuals ''threaten'' China's feudal institutions again. <P>
   Deng, the paramount Chinese leader died Wednesday in Beijing of  
Parkinson's disease at the age of 92.  <P>
   His death was announced by the Central Committee of the Chinese  
Communist Party, which called on the Chinese nation to unite under  
the leadership of President Jiang Zemin and continue with the  
policy of reforms ''for the building of a strong, prosperous,  
democratic, civilised and socialist China.   <P>
   State radio and television broadcast his death every hour,  
eulogising Comrade Deng. Authorities also announced the creation  
of a funeral committee of 450 members led by Party leader Jiang. <P>
   The chief architect of China's almost 20-year economic  
liberalisation programme, was born to a prosperous landowner in  
Paifungcun village in Guangan County, Sichuan province. <P>
   Almost nothing is known about his upbringing, though his Red  
Guard critics in the 1960s said he had been a ''protected child''.  
His early teen years were spent under the umbrella of his  
stepmother, his father's third wife. <P>
   After a few months of preparatory school in Chongqing, Deng  
left China at the age of 16 and with a group of more than 100  
Chinese teenagers began a work/study programme in France. He later  
said he never really went to school in France though he did  
briefly attend several secondary schools. As an unskilled worker,  
Deng held jobs in factories such as the Renault works near Paris. <P>
   Soon after arriving in France in late 1920s, Deng became active  
in the worker-student movement. He joined the Chinese communist  
youth league in 1922 and the Communist Party in 1924.  <P>
   Deng went underground when French police cracked down on  
Chinese communist students and deported their leaders in 1925. He  
left France in January 1926 to escape arrest, made his way home  
via the former Soviet Union and was assigned a series of party  
jobs on his return to China. <P>
   The early 1930s saw a bitter conflict between pro-Moscow  
faction leaders in the Chinese Communist Party and those like Deng  
who firmly stood behind the young maverick revolutionary, Mao  
Zedong, who founded the People's Republic of China in 1949. <P>
   In 1932, Deng was named director of the Party's central  
committee but was purged the following year for supporting Mao's  
policies. This was the first of the purges that Deng had to face  
in his tumultuous political career. <P>
   Still, Deng's infallible faith in Mao saw him take part in the  
Long March that began in October 1934 when Mao's revolutionary  
peasant force was kept on the move for more than a year across  
rural China then embroiled in a civil war with nationalist  
elements. <P>
	Subsequently, Deng held a series of party and military posts,  
including political commissar of the 129th Division of the Eighth  
Route Army that won key campaigns in the communists' power  
consolidation in the war against the Kuomintang and Japanese  
forces. <P>
   In the last years of the Civil War (1945-49), Red Army units  
under Deng's supervision achieved major victories in taking  
control over Nanjing, capital of the Kuomintang government,  
Shanghai and crossing the torrential Yangtse River. <P>
   Deng entered the Party's elite circle when he was elected to  
the central committee at the Seventh Party Congress in 1945 -  
where Maoist thought was firmly inscribed in the Party  
constitution and Mao's power became virtually absolute. <P>
   After Liberation in 1949, Deng was appointed the first party  
secretary and political commissar for south-west China, making him  
that region's most powerful figure. Three years later, he was made  
vice-premier and Party secretary general. He was elected to the  
Politburo and into its standing committee in 1956. <P>
   In the next two years, Deng was a leading figure in the  
crackdown on intellectuals in the ''anti-rightist campaign''. He  
called for the elimination of ''bourgeois intellectuals'' who  
advocated ''the so-called freedom of the press, freedom of  
publishing and the freedom in literature and the arts.'' <P>
   This was the first time Deng publicly expressed hardline  
political tendencies when confronted with popular calls for  
liberalisation of the system, China observers say. <P>
	Such political conservatism was later echoed against the  
Democracy Wall campaign of the 1970s and before the bloody army  
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989  
when hundreds of students were killed,  <P>
   Initially, Deng's ability to lie low and speak only at the  
opportune moment helped him survive the political turmoil between  
the late 50s and early 70s -- an era of deadly purges under Mao's  
direction. <P>
	For example, he did not oppose the Great Leap Forward in 1958,  
until its disastrous effects were clear. Later, he said that Mao  
was ''overly enthusiastic at the time of the Great Leap Forward''  
and that ''the rest of us were overly enthusiastic as well''.  <P>
   In the early 1960s, Deng did try to remedy the setbacks of the  
period when, with then President Liu Shaoqi, he urged economic  
reforms similar to those he later adopted in the late 70s and  
early 80s. <P>
	Justifying a return to individual farming and a wage incentive  
system, he said: ''It makes no difference if the cat is black or  
white, so long as it catches mice it is a good cat.'' <P>
   Such apolitical practicality soon lost him favour with Mao who  
launched the decade long Cultural Revolution in 1966 in a  
successful attempt to regain the initiative in a power struggle.  
Deng was quickly labelled the ''second greatest capitalist roader  
in the party'' after President Liu. <P>
   In 1967, Deng was stripped of his posts and sent to a re- 
education camp, where he found himself waiting on tables in a  
Party canteen. Two years later, he was banished to Jianxi  
province, where he, his wife and his elderly stepmother lived in  
an abandoned army camp and raised their own pig and vegetables.  <P>
   Deng worked half-days in a tractor factory until 1973, when he  
was allowed to return to Beijing and regain his seat on the  
Central Committee. By 1974, Deng was entrusted to deliver a key  
address at the United Nations on Mao's 'Theory of the Three  
Worlds'. This was at a time when then Premier Zhou En-lai was  
trying to rebuild China's world image. <P>
   But it was not long after that Deng was again under ideological  
attack -- this time from Mao's ex-actress wife Qiang Qing and her  
ultra-leftist supporters. <P>
	Three months after Zhou's death in January 1976, Deng was held  
responsible for a commemorative demonstration in Tiananmen Square.  
He was again removed from his posts - Deng's third fall from power -  
though not so serious as the 1967 one. <P>
   After Mao's death later in 1976, Deng was cleared of any  
connection with the Tiananmen incident and his posts restored. At  
the important third plenary session of the 11th Central Committee  
in December 1978, Deng's political policies became the Party's  
predominant theme. <P>
   He attacked radical Maoists for preaching ''blind faith'' and  
phoney Marxism''. He asserted that ''practice is the sole  
criterion for truth'' and put forward the slogan gleaned from  
Mao's prolific writings: ''Seek truth from facts''. <P>
   In the following years, Deng eased out Hua Guofeng, Mao's  
nominal successor. In 1981, he gained Party approval for a re- 
evaluation of Mao.  <P>
   Deng once said that he did not like Mao's ''patriarchal  
behaviour.'' Mao ''really behaved in an unhealthy and feudal  
way'', Deng was quoted telling a foreign journalist in 1980.  <P>
   But he made a distinction between the ''political errors'' of  
Mao and the ''crimes'' of Lin Biao (Mao's former defence minister  
and once-favoured successor). Deng saw to it that Mao's wife and  
his closest followers were tried and sentenced to life  
imprisonment for their ''crimes''. <P>
   In 1983, Deng also launched a three-year ''rectification''  
campaign to purge leftist activists from the Cultural Revolution  
and re-educate the rank-and-file in his doctrine and policies. <P>
   By 1982, Deng had begun a thorough restructuring of the State  
Council and its ministries and in two years cut the military's  
manpower by over one million -- or one-fourth of its size. <P>
   Previously, he had announced a reform package for the rural  
economy in December 1978. A comparable programme for the urban and  
industrial sectors began in October 1984. These reversed Mao's  
programmes and redefined Marxism, in a way that befuddled his  
admirers and enraged orthodox Marxist critics.  <P>
   By 1985, Deng managed to rejuvenate the top levels of the Party  
and government with younger, better educated leaders who were  
nominally committed to his programmes.  <P>
   During this time, Deng started calling publicly for senior  
Chinese politicians to step aside from day-to-day Party activities  
to make way for the fresh talents to ''steer the country''. It was  
a signal that he intended to step behind the curtains, but still  
continue to control the Party's workings. <P>
   But he was to keep a high profile for another four years,  
overseeing displacement of his own chosen few in the ranks, such  
as party chief Zhao Ziyang, for supporting the student-led pro- 
democracy movement in 1989.  <P>
   But the manner in which the 1989 pro-democracy activists were  
suppressed generated enough heat within the country and overseas  
to curb Deng's sponsored reforms for a few years until late 1992. <P>
   The Tiananmen Square incident also hurt Deng's image as a  
benign Chinese patriarch who favoured relative political freedom  
over Maoist-style autocratic control, and accelerated the process  
of his much-awaited decision to ''retire'.'  <P>
   In November 1989, the official press carried Deng's ''letter of  
resignation'' to the Party Central Committee. ''In 1980, I had  
already proposed that...lifetime tenure (of holding senior Party  
posts) should be abolished,'' he wrote. ''In the past few years,  
many old comrades have withdrawn from their leading positions one  
after the another.'' <P>
   Despite giving up all his posts, Deng wrote that his life  
''still belonged to the Party and the state'' and that even after  
his ''retirement'', he would ''remain loyal to the cause of the  
Party and the state''.  <P>
   The moment had come for Deng Xiaoping, who had just turned 85,  
to manoeuvre himself into the post of communist China's paramount  
leader, which had been vacant since Mao's death.  <P>
   Since November 1989, Deng has been China's behind-the-scenes  
emperor, surfacing only rarely in the early 90s. At the time of  
his death, he had not been seen in public for three years. <P>
   His chosen leadership, headed by President Jiang Zemin, has  
continued to enforce market-style changes, gradually demolishing  
the centralised economic control China has known since 1949.

It covers an area of 945,166 km2 (about 42 timesthe size of Britain). Tanzania is bordered by Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundiand Zaire, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. Dar es Salaam is the capital,although a new, central city, Dodoma, is projected to become capital bythe end of the century.<BR><BR>Tanzania's name signifies the union between Tanganyika and the two islandsof Unguja and Pemba, which with several other smaller islands constituteZanzibar.<BR><BR>Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania cover a vast, flat plateau which rises to about1,500m from a narrow coastal belt. The region is famous for the 20 millionyear old Great Rift Valley which cuts a deep trough up to 2,000m deep throughthe plateau from the Dead Sea to Mozambique.<BR><BR>East Africa's highest mountains are volcanic in origin, created by the sameforces which created the Rift Valley. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountainin Africa, is the most recent of these. Ngorongoro Crater is the collapsedcaldera of a volcano. One active volcano remains in Tanzania - Ol DoinyoLengai.<BR><BR>Tanzania is bordered by three great lakes: Lake Victoria in the north, LakeTanganyika to the west and Lake Nyasa to the south-west. Lake Victoria isthe source of the Nile.<BR><BR><H3>Climate</H3>Most of Tanzania has a tropical climate with regional variations. The coastalbelt and Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika are hot and humid while most of theinterior is hot and dry. October to April are hotter than May to Septemberwith November to May being the rainy season.<BR><H3>Economy</H3>77% of the population live a subsistence lifestyle in the countryside. Maize,millet (sorghum) and cassava are the staple crops, along with rice. Theyare used to make a stiff dough called ugali (oo-gar-ly). Ugali or rice,is eaten with green leaf vegetables, meat: beef, chicken or goat or fish.Avocados, apples, bananas, mangoes, passion fruit, pears, pineapples, onions,plantain, tomatoes, carrots, red beans, peanuts and sugar cane are grown.Many farmers keep cattle, for milk and meat, and goats and chickens.<BR><BR>The country's major exports are coffee, cotton, cashew nuts, sisal, tobacco,tea and diamonds. Zanzibar and Pemba export cloves and other spices. Gold,tin and coal are also mined.<BR><BR>External debt: US$ 4.6 million<BR>Debt service as % of exports of goods and services: 30<BR><BR><h3>Culture</h3>The country has a rich culture of music and dancing with many ceremonies.Carving, pottery and weaving are traditional crafts still practised to providegoods for everyday life, with many local variations in design.<BR><BR><HR>&copy;Copyright: UNICEF 1996 <HR><a href="index.html" target="_parent"><IMG SRC="unicef_pix/unicef_logo2.gif"WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="36" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=bottom>Unicef Home Page</A><HR></BODY></HTML>

<TR><TD><B>After meeting at the Hammersmith Unemployed Workers' Centre at 10 o'clock on Sunday the 5th of May 1996 the campaigners were given a <a href="happen.html">leaflet</a>.  Then a convoy consisting of two coaches full of campaigners, tat lorries and travellers left for the first planned site.  After successfully claiming the land the coaches returned to collect everyone else and the location of the site was publically released.

<P>

Work started as soon as people arrived at about 10:30 Sunday morning.  Between then and Sunday afternoon the reception, the kitchen, a peat bog toilet, pathways, and more had been constructed by many willing hands.

<P>

A spokesperson for The Land Is Ours (George Monbiot) spoke to the local police immediately after arriving at the site.  The police stated that the occupation was a civil matter and not crimimal and this means that the matter didn't involve the police it was just between the occupiers and the land owners, Guinness.  Guinness portray themselves as being concerned with the environment which we felt would be good news for us.

<P>

Octavia'sThe local residents and shop owners were given a <a href="locleaf.html">leaflet</a> about the occupation. They were asked to take part in a survey which asked them what they thought of the occupation and the future use of the land.  Most of the residents are not opposed to the occupation as they do not agree with future plans to build a Safeways superstore on the site which they feel would increase traffic on an already over-busy road.

<P>

KitchenA health and environment inspector from Wandsworth Council found no fault with the site when he visited it on Wednesday the 8th.  Saturday the 11th was an open day at the occupation and hundreds of local people attended our meeting and showed their support.  Lots of activities were put on and a similar day was planned for Sunday the 12th.

<P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

An "Order by Consent" was asked for, which meant that people would be allowed to stay until Guinness finally decide to use and develop the land which will not be in the near future.  It looked promising that they would agree but unfortunately they refused the order on Monday the 13th.

<P>

George Monbiot was summoned to court on Wednesday the 15th of May.</B>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. ECHO'S NEW DIRECTOR SPELLS OUT HIS INTENTIONS

TO MEPS</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The new Director of the European Community Humanitarian

Office, ECHO, Alberto Navarro, presented his plans before the

Development Committee of the European Parliament last week. Mr

Navarro confirmed that at a political level he was in agreement

with his Commissioner Emma Bonino, stressing that ECHO's purpose

was not to compensate for the lack of political solutions or will

in a region in crisis because humanitarian assistance could never

replace preventive diplomatic actions. He stated that in the near

future, ECHO's priorities would continue to be intervention in

Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire and in the former Yugoslavia and Caucasus

as well as assistance to women and children in Afghanistan. Mr.

Navarro added, that for the first time, the Commission will, in

February, present the Council with a strategic plan of ECHO's

activities.  </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The Director responded to the criticism of the rigid

nature of ECHO's agreement concluded with the 170 NGOs responsible

for implementing European aid on the ground, stating that ECHO

undertook to show flexibility and openness towards NGOs within

the limits of the rigorous financial management inherited from

his predecessor. He added that the framework/agreement, which

has been extended to May, will be reviewed this year. In response

to the MEPS queries on the cost of running ECHO, he emphasised

that in 1997 ECHO had been allocated a budget of  650 million

ECU. This corresponds to only 2% of the agriculture budget.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. ECHO COMMISSIONER IN ZAIRE EVALUATE OBSTACLES

TO THE RESUMPTION OF HUMANITARIAN AID</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> ECHO Commissioner, Emma Bonnino, is off on a four

day trip to Zaire today. She will assess the humanitarian situation,

logistical needs and the problems that need to be resolved to

allow aid to reach the Eastern part of the country. She is accompanied

by a delegation from ECHO and will visit Kinshasa and Kinsagagni

as well as the refugee camps recently set up in the region. Before

her departure, Mrs Bonino stated that she was counting on the

co-operation from the Zairian authorities to guarantee access

to the hundred thousand ill and starving refugees recently located

by NGOs.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR MORE INTEGRATED

HUMANITARIAN AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES           </FONT></B>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>MEPs from the Development

Committee this week called for greater co-ordination of humanitarian

aid between the Community and its Member States, the UN Agencies

and the regrouping of external services of the EC. The MEPs on

the basis of the Raimondo Fassa Report called for the following

reforms: 1) the integration of diplomacy and humanitarian intervention

capacity with commercial and development aid policies in the Common

Foreign and Security Policy 2) the creation of a European Corps

made up of civilian and military units, in co-operation with the

WEU, responsible for peace keeping/making operations; 3) the creation

of a European research centre for the active prevention of crises;

4) the setting up of a permanent international criminal court;

5) fuller social participation and integration of local populations

to encourage democracy; 6) European monitoring of arms exports

and; 7) a clearer definition of the conditionally of European

aid. </FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>In a separate debate

on the work of the ACP/EU Joint Assembly, the Development Committee

called for an improvement of EU/ACP co-operation. On the basis

of a report prepared by Ms. Monica Baldi (Italy, UPE), the Committee

called for a) the European Development Fund to be incorporated

into the general budget to ensure EP scrutiny; b) the continuation

of the assessment of the right of intervention; c)the inclusion

of the Joint Assembly in discussions and negotiations on the future

of EU/ACP co-operation. </FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EP CALLS FOR THE DENIAL OF ASYLUM IN THE COMMUNITY

TO TERRORISTS FROM MEMBER STATES</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> MEPs adopted a report on the fight against terrorism

by an overwhelming majority yesterday. The report drafted by Christian

Democrat Vivian Reding called for, inter alia, nationals of Member

States accused of terrorism to be denied the right to asylum or

refugee status in other Member States. This was with the aim of

introducing in the EU Treaty, &quot;effective principles for close

co-operation in the field of judicial assistance, as a crucial

component in  the fight against terrorism and other forms of organised

crime.&quot;<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>5. EUROSTEP MEETINGS WITH TOP OFFICIALS ON THE

GREEN PAPER</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The Chair of the Eurostep Steering Committee, Sabina

Siniscalchi of Mani Tese, along with fellow Eurostep members Phil

Bloomer and Brendan Gomerly of OXFAM UK and Simon Stocker - Director

of the Eurostep Secretariat, met with DG VIII Commissioner, Joao

de Deus Pinheiro, on 23 January 1997. The objectives of the meeting

were: to present Eurostep as serious player in discussions on

the future EU-ACP relationship; to press the main issues on the

Eurostep agenda for these debates; to establish a stronger political

entry into the Commission; and to offer help facilitate possibilities

for debate and consultation following the Green Paper.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Later on 28 January, Eurostep, the EC Liaison Committee,

APRODEV and Voice were invited to a meeting with Danish Minister

of Development Paul Nielsen and members of the Danish Foreign

Affairs Committee for an exchange of views on the future of EU

development policies in general and the Commission's Green Paper

in particular.  Eurostep was represented by Brita S. Nielson.

In that period, millions of people have been victims of these grave crimes but only a handful of cases have been tried by national courts.<p>The human rights organization stated that the two ad hoc international criminal tribunals established by the security Council for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia were a major step forward. These tribunals need continued support from all UN member states, but they are only a temporary stop gap.<p>"There is no justification to have temporary tribunals for permanent problems. It is now up to the General Assembly to establish quickly a permanent court which would try suspects in all countries," Amnesty International said.<p>The organization urged world leaders to agree that the General Assembly should agree to convene a conference and preparatory meetings in 1996 to draft a statute for such a court at the earliest possible date. <p>A permanent international criminal court would not be able to try every person suspected of such crimes, but it could act whenever national courts were unable or unwilling to do so. It would send a powerful signal to all those who think they are above the law and free to commit grave human rights violations with impunity. Governments should also show they are politically and financially supporting the two ad hoc tribunals. <p>"World leaders should comply with UN Security Council resolutions requiring all UN member states to cooperate with the two ad hoc tribunals by gathering evidence and transferring suspects to those tribunals," Amnesty International said.<p>"It is deeply shocking that only 12 out of 185 UN member states have adopted the necessary legislation more than two years after the establishment of the tribunal for former Yugoslavia. Further more, only three states have adopted such legislation nearly one year after the establishment of the tribunal for Rwanda." In many countries without such legislation, suspects cannot be arrested and transferred to the tribunals. <p>Amnesty International has declared that there could be no lasting peace in either Rwanda or former Yugoslavia without justice. It is, therefore, essential to bring to justice those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and serious violations of humanitarian law. They should not benefit from any special amnesty law or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them from	any criminal proceedingsor sanction.<p>The organization has also called upon the leaders to ensure that the tribunals have adequate resources and to ensure that the current financial crisis facing the UN wouldn't interfere with the current work. <p>"Today, the world's governments have a rare opportunity to enhance the system of international justice. Last year's UN General Assembly once more postponed the decision on launching the court. This year is crucial," Amnesty International said. "This opportunity must not be lost." <p><p><br>_______________________________________________________________________________ <p>If you are a UK based journalist and require further information please call the AIUK Press Officeon 0171 814 6248 or e-mail <ul>bdooley@ai-uk.gn.apc.org<br>rbunting@ai-uk.gn.apc.org.</ul><p>If you are reading this page within the UK and require further information or more informationabout AIUK contact the AIUK Information Office on 0171 814 6200 or e-mail<ul> jdarcy@ai-uk.gn.apc.org<br>tholanda@ai-uk.gn.apc.org <br>aharris@ai-uk.gn.apc.org</ul><p>If you are reading this page outside of the UK and require further information about Amnesty,please contact your <ahref="http://freenet.carleton.ca/freenet/rootdir/menus/social.services/amnes ty/further/international/">local section</a> or the <a href= http://www.io.org/amnesty/overview.html">International Secretariat </a>of Amnesty International.<p><hr><a href="index.html"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif">Amnesty International UK Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<h3>Why is Finland involved in development cooperation?</h3></center>

<hr>

<p>


The primary motive for our involvement in development cooperation is a desire to help those in less fortunate circumstances than ourselves, and thereby to promote peace and prosperity throughout the world.<p>





A deepening concern for the future of our planet has emerged alongside the conventional sphere of development cooperation in recent years. More attention is being paid to global issues, from poverty and development problems to population growth and environmental protection. Refugeeism resulting from political instability, armed conflict and natural disasters has emerged as another critical problem. Crises of a global scale can only be solved through cooperation between industrial and developing countries.<p>


<hr size=3>


<ul>


<li><h4>Objectives</h4>





Development cooperation is that part of foreign policy through which Finland strives





<ul><li>to promote sustainable development and well-being in developing countries


<li>to contribute to the establishment of peace, equality, democratic conditions and human rights in these countries and


<li>to further interaction between Finland and developing countries.</ul><p>





<hr size=3>





<li><h4>Principles</h4>


The states, international organizations and other bodies with which Finland is engaged in development cooperation must commit themselves to the following three objectives:


<ol>


<li>to reduce the wide-spread poverty in developing countries


<li>to combat global threats to the environment by helping the developing countries to solve their environmental problems and


<li>to promote social equality, democracy and human rights in the developing countries.<p></ol>





The main principle of Finland's development cooperation is that a developing country is responsible for its own development. Thus the donor's role is always merely a supportive one. <a href="strategy.html">The strategy for Finland's development cooperation</a> in the 1990s was adopted in 1993.<p>





</ul>


<hr size=3>





<h3>How much public funds are spent on development aid</h3>





Finland attained the UN target level for development aid (0.7% of GDP) in 1991. The same year, the Government began cutting funds allocated for development cooperation. In 1992, appropriations were cut to 0.4% of GDP. The aim is to restore the level of appropriations to 0.7% of GDP as soon as the economic recovery so permits.


<hr size=3>


<h3>How much Finland spends on aid compared to other countries</h3>





In 1993, disbursements for official development cooperation corresponded to 0.45% of GDP, which was below the level of the other Nordic countries (Denmark 1.03%, Norway 1.01%, and Sweden 0.97%).





Cuts in funding have entailed a marked downscaling of activities. Only one in four of the 200 bilateral development cooperation projects under way in 1992 could be continued as originally planned. Other projects have had to be scaled down, rescheduled, postponed or suspended. Very few new projects have been launched. Finland has substantially reduced its contributions to UN development programmes and funds. Finland's contributions to the international financial institutions have likewise declined.








<h4>Official development aid of some OECD countries as a percentage of GDP in 1993</h4>


<pre>


Country		% of GDP


Denmark		1.03


Norway		1.01


Sweden		0.97


The Netherlands	0.81


France 		0.63


Finland		0.45


EU average	0.42


OECD average	0.29

<B>1 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ACCEPTS DEAL WITH MOROCCO</B>

<P>

On Friday 7 June the European Parliament voted to accept the Euro-Mediterranean

agreement with Morocco.  The vote is seen as a great dissapontment

to many who were hoping for a clear rejection of the deal on the

grounds of the human rights situation in Morocco.  The basis of

the debate was a report to the Parliament which advised that the

agreement has great political and geostrategic importance.  Mr

Bernard Kouchner said in the debate that a 'yes' given hesitantly

would be more useful in the long run than an outright rejection.

 Although only the Greens and European United Left groups actually

voted against the agreement (65 votes against compared to 263

for), most of the members who spoke voiced some criticism of the

situation in Morocco.  MEPs criticised the continuing human rights

abuses and the failure of Morocco to give constructive support

to the settlement of the conflict in Western Sahara, an initative

started by the United Nations.

<P>

The vote was overshadowed by the recent history of the expansion

of the European Union's agreements with its neighbours, especially

the free trade agreement with Turkey which was approved by the

Parliament in December last year.  A similar logic was applied

on that occassion where the Parliament felt that engagement would

be more useful than rejection.  

<P>

<B><a href="reality.htm">REALITY OF AID</a></B>

<P>

The 1996 edition of <I>Reality of Aid</I> will be launched on

Monday 17 June.  The report aims to give a critique from an NGO

perspective and has a growing reputation as an accessible reference

for information and trends in official developlent aid and donor

policies.  The central theme for the 1996 <I>Reality of Aid</I>

is the eradication of poverty.

<P>

Key points highlighted in the report include the continuing reductions

in the aid budget of major donors and the difference between the

rhetoric and reality of donor policies.  Although every donor

(except the USA) has reaffirmed its commitment to the UN aid target

of 0.7% of GDP within the last five years, 8 out of 21 donors

cut their aid as a percentage of GDP in 1995.  

<P>

Figures published for the first time in 1995 reveal almost unbelievably

small expenditures on basic education (0.1% of total aid) and

basic health (0.3%).  The average amount spent by donors on water

and sanitation is just 4%.

<P>

<I>Reality of Aid</I> is published by Earthscan for Eurostep and

ICVA.  Not only is it being lauched simultaneously in Brussels

and Washington on Monday, but there will also be launches in many

other places including the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Australia,

Canada, Vietnam, Nepal, Zimbabwe, Fiji and India.  It is designed

so that agencies can disseminate the report as widely as possible

and use it as an advocacy tool to highlight dwindling aid budgets

and the impact on the poor.

<P>

<B>3 EURO - AFRICA SUMMIT FOR AID</B>

<P>

The idea of a summit meeting between European and African countries

has been put forward as a means of revitalising the interest of

the european public in the EU's aid policies.  The suggestion

came from European Development Commissioner Jaoa de Deus Pinheiro.

 He said that the meeting, to be held in 1997, would throw open

the debate over the future of the Lom&eacute; convention and encourage

'people-driven' renegotiation.  Mr Pinheiro also hoped that the

Commissions green paper on Lom&eacute;, to be published in October

this year, would have a similar effect.

<P>

The Commission is evidently worried by the Eurobarometer poll,

which was mentioned in the PAF two weeks ago.  This survey of

the opinions of people across Europe showed that 'helping people

in poor countries in Asia, Africa, and South America' had slipped

down the list of priorities.  

<P>

<B>4 CONFERENCE ON RELATIONS BEYOND LOME IV</B>

<P>

Today is the last day of a conference on the future of relations

between European Union and ACP countries.  The conference is organised

in Maastricht by the European Centre for Development Policy Management

and started on Wednesday of this week.  The idea was to provide

an interface between the EU Commision and representatives of member

states with the views of all others interested in the negotiations

including NGOs, private sector, university etc.

<P>

<B>5 SOCIALISTS OPEN DEVELOPMENT DEBATE</B>

<P>

On 11 July the Socialist Group of the European Parliament is beginning

a series of talks with representatives from developing countries

over the European Union's development policy.  The discussions

will include issues such as the future of the Lom&eacute; convention,

the targetting of EU assistance to the poorest countries etc.

 These talks will continue until October of this year and will

culminate in some sort of socialist summit meeting, the exact

nature of which has not yet been announced.

<center><h3>A SAMPLE 'ENDPIECE' FROM NEW INTERNATIONALIST</h3>


<h1>Scotch on the Rocks</h1>

<p>

<font size=+1><i>Or from Highlands to low life - <b>Alison Napier </b>was near the end

of the journey.</i></font></center>
<hr width=80%>
<p>



Brian lived in the Highlands, in a cottage, near a village - a

popular village with big, old houses turned into big, old

hotels. Tourists came and stayed in the village that became a

town. They watched the Highland Games and bought souvenir

programmes, and back in the hotel with oak staircases and red

carpets and antlers on every wall they drank tea and ate

shortbread. 

<p>

Before lunch there'd be a guided walk through a gate, Hotel

Patrons Only, down a path by a stream, ice-cold like Cola, brown

and frothy. They'd creep and stumble and gingerly step over

rocks and puddles. Wet ferns and bracken slapped their legs, the

midges were out, so thank God we could turn back for lunch, for

Scotch broth and venison roast. At night a performance, a

concert, a ceilidh, a great deal of whisky, a great deal of

whisky. And a traditional English breakfast next morning.

<p>

This is where Brian lived - a wee boy in long grey shorts and a

shirt and a pullover and a cap, scrambling along tracks, over

boulders, up trees, up hills, hiding near the railway line to

watch the trains, only three a day mind you, and fewer now. His

father worked the signals at the station in the village, and he

drank a lot and hit his wife and sons, but couldn't remember

after, and his mother kept her head down and gritted her teeth

and bore children as her mother had done before her. An ordinary

family. Brian went to school and did his lessons, an ordinary

boy who hummed and whistled and swished the tops off the bracken

with a stick.

<p>

Twenty years later, wife and kids and job and house behind him,

Brian was living in London, a hostel full of big old staircases

and hundreds of beds. Residents Only. A Victorian workhouse in

fact, for the derelicts, the dossers, the winos, the losers, the

drunks, the scroungers, the beggars, the wasters, the outcasts,

the scum, and there are only two rules you know, no alcohol and

no fighting on the premises and it's your choice.

<p>

Oh God, it's Brian again - lurching up to the office hatch with

narrow red eyes and thick speech we cannot translate, not even

I, and we share a common tongue. 'Go to bed, Brian,' we say with

one voice, scarcely glancing up from the Situations Vacant pages

in the newspaper. Just go to bed. 'Bed' is a

six-feet-by-two-feet bench with a thin stained mattress, a sheet

and a blanket, in a cubicle eight feet by four feet that smells

of disinfectant and urine, with hardboard walls that do not

reach the ceiling and a door that does not lock. Please. Go to

bed.  

<p>

He has bumped into the cigarette machine and is kicking it.

Perhaps it will work now, it's been jammed for days. He is

rubbing his eyes with the backs of his hands, sobbing and crying

and swearing and running crazily to the Gents where he locks

himself in, the only private space there is. Brian, I call.

Brian. 'Leave me alane. Leave me alane the lo' o' yiz.' The

crying stops. I hear the sound of vomiting. Then crying again,

quieter. I tiptoe away.

<p>

Another night, at half past two, we hear this god-awful singing

in the street, loud and tuneless, 'oh flower o' Scotland, when

wull we see yer like again, who fought an' died fur yer wee bit

hill an' glen, an' stood against them...', verse after tuneless

verse, what a performance, I can hear people opening windows,

people shouting, the phone rings and it is someone in the posh

flats opposite: 'shut him up or I'll call the police'. The sound

of breaking glass. From their balconies they are throwing down

milk bottles at him, oh if only they had thrown flowers, oh

Brian why are you always drunk, on cider and extra-strong lager

and a great deal of whisky, a great deal of whisky.

<p>

His friend Fred says that Brian can't remember singing or being

dragged inside, so don't mention it, he'll be awful embarrassed.

<p>

I move on, get a better job, a nicer room in a smaller city. The

hostel is closed and may be sold, prime office space in Central

London. Some who lived there are homeless and some who worked

there are jobless, and I hear about George and Jimmy and John

from Australia and oh yes that drunk Brian, he jumped under an

Inter-City 125 train. The London to Edinburgh 125. The London to

Edinburgh 125. The London to Edinburgh 125.

<p>

So I drank a great deal of whisky, a great deal of whisky, and

wandered away and hid by the railway line to watch the trains,

heading north.

<B>1 EUROPEAN UNION SUMMIT IN FLORENCE</B>

<P>

The European Heads of State and Government who attended the European

Council meeting in Florence over the weekend several issues external

relations.   When Africa was brought up the situation in the Great

Lakes Region dominated the discussion.  The Council pushed the

long standing EU position which is to call for the organisation

of a regional conference under the joint auspices of the UN and

the OAU to address the root causes of the conflicts.  There was

also support and encouragement for the EU Special Envoy to Great

Lakes Regions and for the efforts of former President Nyerere

in his endeavours to find a peace acceptable to all.  There was

also some discussion of the idea to organise a joint EU-African

summit aimed at strengthening peace and democracy in Africa. 

This idea was first put forward my European Commissioner Pinheiro

last month.

<P>

The European Council expressed the great importance it attaches

to the Mediterranean dimension of the European Union and approved

of the progress made so far under the Declaration on the Euro-Mediterranean

partnership from Barcelona 1995.  On Asia, the recent summit of

Asian and European Leaders in Bangkok was saluted by the European

Council.  The efforts of China to restructure its economy were

also noted.  The European Council made a point of stressing its

desire to see the further development of the rule of law and more

committed respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. 

It feels that the present policy of a constructive dialogue with

China is the best way to achieve this progress.

<P>

In a separate statement before the summit got under way, the Italian

Presidency of the EU issued a statement on the Great Lakes Region

and in particular on Burundi.  The ideas expressed included those

later endorsed by the European Council together with an appeal

to the Heads of State who signed the Cairo and Tunis Declarations

to comply with the undertakings they gave at those meetings

<P>

<B>2 ECONOMIC RECOVERY CONFIRMED IN AFRICA</B>

<P>

The African Continent showed signs of recovery in 1995, according

to the latest report from the United Nations body - the Economic

Commission for Africa (ECA).  GDP growth across the whole of the

continent was 2.4% in 1995, compared to 2.1% in 1994 and a miserable

0.7% in 1993.  2.4% still is not a great deal.  With the headline

figure for growth at 2.4%, the claims for a recovery seem a little

overstated.  However, a more encouraging piece of news was that

the record of the 33 poorest countries in the region have improved

dramatically.  In 1995 the average growth rate for these countries

was +2.4, compared to -2.4% in 1993 and -1.6% in 1994.

<P>

Commodities prices were relatively high in 1995, which resulted

in an increase of 11.1% in export earnings over 1994.  Another

sector which performed very well was the manufacturing industries,

which grew by 4.12%.  However, the agricultural sector, which

accounts for the daily work of most of the continents people,

was dull with a growth of just 1.5%.  This average figure obscures

regional variations including the serious loss of production in

the southern african region, which was down 7% on 1994.

<P>

The idea of a recovery looks even more limited in scope when you

consider that the population of Africa is increasing at 2.9% per

year.  Therefore the 2.4% growth in the economy represents a fall

in 

<P>

GDP per capita.  However, the results are encouraging in so far

as they are heading in the right direction.  The full text of

this report will become available on the internet in the near

future.  You can pay the ECA a visit at their webb site - http:/www.sas.unpenn.edu/African_Studies/ECA/AfEcMenu.html

<P>

<B>3 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKS OUT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS</B>

<P>

During its Plenary session in Strasbourg last week, the European

Parliament adopted a total of nine resolutions on human rights

issues.  The highlights  were

<P>

I) East Timor - EP condemns military oppression and calls for

the immediate release of all political prisoners.   The European

Commission in invited to draw up a report on the situation in

East Timor and on human rights violation in Indonesia.

<P>

ii) Nigeria - the EP invited the AU to isolate Nigeria politically.

 Following the killing of Mrs. Abiola the Parliament voted in

favour of an increase in the sanctions against Nigeria and for

the release of all political prisoners.

<P>

iii) Burma - The EP strongly condemns the abuse of human rights

in Burma and especially the new law approved by slorc banning

the National League for Democracy.  

<P>

iv) Burundi - The Parliament strongly condemned the killing of

three Swiss members of the International Committee of the Red

Cross and demanded an in-depth and objective inquiry into their

deaths.  However, the European Parliament urged the Commission

no to close its delegation to Burundi and to maintain its humanitarian

aid.  They also called for the creation of an international force,

the implementation of the Carcassone plan, and the provision of

assistance to re-establish a legal system.

<P>

Other resolutions dealt with China, Turkey, Belarus, and Chile

with one further resolution criticised a member state of the EU

- namely Britain - for its detention of a radical Sikh journalist

called Raghbir Singh Johal.  The Parliament called on the British

Government to either prove his complicity in cases of international

terrorism or to release him immediately.

<P>

<B>4 A NEW FISHERIES DEAL FOR MAURITANIA</B>

<P>

In the face of growing concern and campaigning action over the

effect of EU fishing deals on the development of poorer countries,

the EU and Mauritania initialed a new five year fisheries agreement

on 20 June which will come into effect on the first day of August

this year.  The agreement allows for a staggering 150% increase

in the authorised tonnage from 76,050 to 184,392.  The price to

be paid to the government of Mauritania for these access rights

is 266.8 million ECU over the five year period.  53 MECU will

come from contributions form the fishing boats themselves.  The

rest is from European tax money.  

<P>

The deal does not include rules for compulsory off-loading in

Mauritania, thereby denying the opportunity to develop a local

fish processing industry to benefit from the increased exploitation

of Mauritania waters.  There will be a brief two month biological

rest period of two moths in September/October to allow fish stocks

to be replenished.

<P>

<B>5 OED FIGURES FOR OFFICIAL AID </B>

<P>

Some new figures published by the Development Assistance Committee

of the OECD shows a continued drop in the level of official development

aid (ODA) during 1995.  At 0.27% of the GDP of  aid giving countries

this is the lowest level of aid since the United Nations adopted

the target of 0.7% in 1970.  Only the Netherlands increased its

assistance in 1995.  France continues to be the G7 member with

the highest ODA/GDP ration but here there was a reduction of 12%

in real.  

<P>

The headline figure for total ODA stood at $59 billion in 1995,

a drop of 9.3% in real terms. <HR>

<H1><CENTER>BRITISH AID BACKS CHINESE AIRPORT CONTRACT </CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
4 December 1995 <BR>
<B><BR>
The ODA is to provide an aid grant of up to &#163;8.4 million in support
of a Siemens Plessey contract to supply &#163;22.5 million of British goods
and services for the now international airport at Nanjing, China. Tho grant
comes from the Aid and Trade Provision budget. The balance of the total
project cost, some &#163;139 million, vall be raisod by the Governmentof
China. </B><BR>
<BR>
A new international airport is being built south of Nanjing, the capital
of Jiangsu Province, to replace the existing airport, which is unable to
meet the projected traffic demands of the city.<BR>
<BR>
Nanjing is an important economic centre, with major electronics, automobile
and chemical industries. It is planned that the city should also be developed
as a research and development centre for new technologies. Transport and
communications, and the new airport in particular, are seen as vital to
such expansion.<BR>
<BR>
It is expected that the new airport will bring times-savings for passengers,
boost export and tourist earnings and raise revenue from users. <BR>
<BR>
The contract will include:
<UL>
<LI>the design of the new airport's operating systems; <BR>
<BR>
<LI>the supply and installation of equipment and spare parts;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>and the transfer of technology for the operation and maintenance of
the systems and equipment installed. 
</UL>
<BR>
To ensure the successful operation of the project, the ODA is also providing
up to &#163;l million to train local staff in airport operations and management,
and for environmental management and land use plans. <BR>
<BR>
<B>NOTES FOR EDITORS </B><BR>
<BR>
1 . Under the terms of the arrangement, the ODA grant will meet 35 per cent
of the cost of the &#163;22.6 million UK contract. The balance of 66 per
cent to be financed on commercial terms. <BR>
<BR>
2. The UK banks West Merchant Bank Limited and Standard Chartered Bank are
providing the &#163;22.6 million loan, supported by the Export Credits Guarantee
Department. <BR>
<BR>
3. This is the largest ATP grant made under the &#163;55 million Third Concessional
Financing Arrangement between Britain and China signed in September 1994.
A Fourth Concessional Financing Arrangement was announced by the Foreign
Secretary in October 1995 for a total contract value of up to &#163;l00
million.<BR>
<BR>
4. The contact at Siemens Plessey is Mr Keith Damen (Tel: 01202 486344)

<br>
<font size=+1>The following is the transcript of <b>'Credit Where It's Due'</b>, a television programme made by Word-Pictures in conjunction with Worldview International Foundation.  <br>
<b>OneWorld Online</b> thanks Arne Fjortoft for his kind permission to broadcast this WIF/Word-Pictures report.</font>
<hr>

<p>
<center><h1>Micro-loans</h1></center>
Micro-loans - very small amounts of money, sometimes no more than a few rupees or taka, loaned to people who cannot afford to offer banks property as collateral -  are of key importance in alleviating poverty. 
<p>
The Grameen Banking system was founded by Dr Mohammed Yunus in 1976 to provide micro-loans to poor people excluded by the conventional banking system - which believes, mistakenly, that poor people are bad credit risks. 
<p>
Women, in particular, have been rejected as customers, by bankers who still see women as 'only housewives' - ignoring the enormous value of women's work, not only in the home but also outside it as agricultural and industrial workers.

<p>
Two decades later, at the <a href="beijing_intro.html#banking">Fourth World Conference for Women</a> in Beijing, there are suggestions that the World Bank is thinking of following in Dr Yunus' footsteps. The Bank is, at last, considering lending amounts of $100 and up, rather than $10,000 and up - and lending to women.
<p>
It should not be forgotten, however, that - for many people using the Grameen Banking system - $100 is a small fortune rather than a small loan. 
<p>
<hr><p>
<font size=+1><b><i>TITLE SEQUENCE</i></b></font><p>


<b>Dr Yunus:
<ul>What we are trying to do is to demonstrate that <i>the bankers are wrong!</i> All banks should give loans to poor people.  If banks are not doing [that], then new banks should be created so that everybody can take loans. 
<p>
We are demonstrating that poor people can take money, take credit, pay back [at a] 98%-plus repayment rate - which can change their own life. They don't have to depend on anybody. They're not asking for any mercy from anybody. <i>They simply need a fair chance, and fair deal, and justice. </i></b>

<font size=+2><b>CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE </b></font><br>
<font size=+1>Dr Yunus and the Grameen Bank</font></center>
<p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>


Woman's voice:
<ul>
Bangladesh has some of the richest soils in the world - but most of us can't benefit from that fact. Out of the 100 million people in our country, 60 million of us own no land at all. Just 8% of the families own nearly half the crop-land - and they keep all the profits. 

Our families just work the land for them, and they pay us next to nothing. 
<p>
We would prefer to buy land and become independent farmers - but where could we get the credit? If we borrow money from the rich, they force us to repay our debt at impossible times; they're blackmailing us into selling them at a loss everything we own. 
<p>
<i>So they end up with everything - and our families with nothing. And the more inequality there is, the more our fate will slide into their hands. </i>
<p>
As for banks! The only time we ever got credit out of a rich man's bank was when Mohammed Yunus came to visit our village, many years ago.
</ul>


<b>Dr Yunus: </b>
<ul>
<b>In the beginning I didn't think about [creating a] bank: all I was trying to do was to take a loan from the bank for poor people in the village that I met. 

But the bank was very reluctant.  They thought it was impossible to lend money to poor people. 
<p>
Ultimately, the only way I could find to get this loan was to offer myself as a guarantor.  
<p>
So I became a guarantor, and took the money from the bank, and gave the money to poor people.  And I took the responsibility of collecting it back, and paying it back to the bank.  And it worked beautifully! 
<p>
That was in 1976. It was working well, so I got very excited and wanted to expand it to give more people similar loans - to show that poor people can take money and pay it back. And they did.</b> 
<p>
</ul></ul>


Woman's voice: 
<ul>
So Dr Yunus began Grameen Banking, which means "village" banking. We're neighbours - we know and trust each other - so we take turns being guarantors for one other, just like Dr Yunus used to. 
<p>

We meet in the village in groups - and now there are Grameen Banks in over 30,000 villages. We, the people of Bangladesh, are solving our credit crisis ourselves.
<p>
</ul>

<b>Dr Yunus: 
<ul>The present banking system is not just, because it only lends money to a very privileged group of people, not the people at the bottom.  So this is what we are dramatising, what we are demonstrating - and we are proving that what we are saying is right. 
<p>
It is happening in Bangladesh, it is being done in many other countries with similar results.  So now it will be very difficult for the banking system, the traditional banking system, to ignore what we have been saying.
<p>
</ul>
</b>

Woman's voice: 
<ul>

Women like us are traditionally supposed to live a very secluded life, always inside the house. 
<br>
In some villages, prayers being offered in a mosque would stop  if a woman passed by. And people said that insects would damage the crops in a field that a woman had walked through.
<p>
 So can you imagine women being allowed to go inside a conventional bank? Much less <i>run </i>the bank, like in Grameen!
<p>
</ul>

<b>Dr Yunus: 
<ul>My allegation against the existing banking system is that it is basically an anti-women institution: it doesn't lend money to women. 

 If you take all the borrowers of a bank together, you only find 1% of [those borrowers are] women.
<p>
So when I began I wanted to make sure that I don't make the same mistake.  So we are trying to achieve an equal number of both men and women. 
<p>
We noticed very remarkable things happening in the families where we lend money to the women.  In those families more benefits are coming than in the families where we gave money to the men.  
</ul>
<p></b>
<hr width=40%>
<center><i><b><font size=+2> The Population Issue </font></b></b></center>
<p>
<br>

<p>

Woman's voice: 
<ul>
Something that hurts us is people from abroad blaming our children for our hardship. They want us to be forbidden to have more than one or two children. 
<p>
Why don't they blame rich families? The rich make us poor - their children hoard and waste such a lot. But people from the North think they are experts on the realities of our life. 
<p>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1><i> INTERVIEW</i></font></b>
<p>
<b>Dr Yunus is interviewed by a senior executive from UNFPA (the United Nations Fund for Population Activities): </b>
<ul>UNFPA interviewer: May I say to you... that I think there could be reason to be restrictive when it comes to the number of children in Bangladesh -  the realities are such...
<p>
<b>Dr Yunus:  I don't believe in that...</b><p>
UNFPA interviewer: You don't believe... <p>
<b>Dr Yunus: I don't believe in that... no.</b>
<p>
UNFPA interviewer:  No.  That's interesting for those who listen to us also.
<p>
<b>Dr Yunus: I don't think [the] number of people is [the] problem. </b>
<p>
UNFPA interviewer:  You don't think so.
<p>
<b>Dr Yunus: 
The problems are the institutions, because when [people can] take care of themselves, they can take care of the number of children.  They are wise people.  People are not stupid! </b>
</ul>
<p>
<hr width=40%>
<p>



Woman's voice: 
<ul>
Dr Yunus  doesn't believe that people have to be poor.  He told us that poverty could easily and quickly be wiped out if people like us had the freedom and the confidence to do things our own way... instead of a few rich families deciding how everything should be run - usually to their advantage, not to ours.
<p>
</ul>

<b>Dr Yunus: 
<ul>I see [the] alleviation of poverty as a do-able proposition. 
<p>

We can remove poverty from the surface of the earth <i>only if we can redesign our institutions</i> - like the banking institutions, and other institutions; if we redesign our policies, if we look back on our concepts, so that we <i>have a different idea of poor people</i>. 
<p>
Because at present poor people are looked upon as if they have to be dependent on somebody's handout, on somebody's mercy. They are NOT looking out for somebody's handout, they are NOT looking out for somebody's mercy. <p>
 <i>They want their legitimate due - and they can handle the rest themselves. They can pull themselves out of poverty.  </i> 
</b>
<p>
</ul>

Commentary: 
<ul>
Grameen Banking has now spread all over the world. Over 40 countries have taken it up: 
not only poorer countries like Sri Lanka but rich ones like France, Norway and the United States. President Clinton is a Grameen fan. 
<p>
For Dr Yunus, credit is as fundamental a human right as the right to freedom of speech, food, shelter, health, or education.
<p>
</ul>


<b>Dr Yunus: 
<ul>Credit is a human right that should be treated as a human right. If credit can be accepted as a human right, then all other human rights will be easier to establish.  
</b>
<p>
</ul>

"In future the question will not be: 'Are people credit-worthy?' but rather:  'Are banks people-worthy?' "

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID began work in The Gambia in 1979 and now has three programme areas. They are all linked
by the common aim, best summed up by the word tesito  or self-help. 

<p>ACTIONAID now works in partnership with more than 178,000 people in 500 plus villages helping them
to tackle their needs in practical and lasting ways. 

<p>While each area faces its own difficulties, one problem is shared by all: inadequate food supply.
Drought and persistent poverty have forced people to cut down forests for fuel and over-work the
land. This leads to poor yields and low incomes, locking families into a downward spiral of debt and
deprivation.

<h3>Examples of ACTIONAID's work in The Gambia</h3><b>ACTIONAID has:</b> 

<p><ul><li>provided assistance to households and communities in developing income generating
projects. These include bee-keeping schemes, river fishing, and vegetable gardening with many of the
projects run by women. 

<p><li>supported visits by healthcare workers to rural villages to monitor children's development and
teach mothers simple, effective ways of treating potentially fatal diseases such as diarrhoea.
ACTIONAID is also training village-based healthworkers to teach villagers about preventative
healthcare. It is developing the skills of traditional midwives and, by constructing latrines and
sinking new wells, working to improve sanitation and hygiene.

<p><li>supplemented the government education programme  by building schools, training teachers and
supplying basic equipment such as chalk, pencils and books.

Si la petite taille du Cap-vert, la dispersion de son territoire

sur de nombreux &icirc;les et &icirc;lots, son climat sah&eacute;lien

en butte continuellement &agrave; la s&eacute;cheresse et &agrave;

l'aridit&eacute; du sol, sa faible population - moins d'un demi-million

d'habitants - expliquent sa grande pauvret&eacute; et exigent

pour sa survie et son d&eacute;veloppement une aide importante

de l'ext&eacute;rieur, ce sont les efforts consentis par ce petit

pays pour assainir son &eacute;conomie, et profiter au maximum

de l'aide ext&eacute;rieure qui lui ont valu une attention particuli&egrave;re

des bailleurs de fonds. Ce n'est pas par hasard que la Commission

europ&eacute;enne a d&eacute;cid&eacute; l'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re

d'augmenter de 7% - soit un surplus de 1,7 million d'ECU - sa

dotation au Programme indicatif national de ce pays dans le cadre

de la Convention de Lom&eacute; (Lom&eacute; IV, premier protocole

1990-95, 7&egrave;me FED). Le Cap-vert avait d&eacute;j&agrave;

engag&eacute; la quasi-totalit&eacute; des 23 MECU qui lui avaient

&eacute;t&eacute; allou&eacute;s, signe d'une administration soucieuse

d'utiliser pleinement l'aide re&ccedil;ue.

<P>

<H3>Quand le r&eacute;alisme est un luxe</H3>

<P>

 Imaginez qu'une &icirc;le habit&eacute;e par une population de

cent soixante mille habitants, l'&icirc;le de S&atilde;o Vicente,

o&ugrave; est situ&eacute;e Mindelo, la deuxi&egrave;me ville

du pays avec 70.000 habitants, ne poss&egrave;de aucune source

d'eau potable. Avant, l'eau arrivait par bateau de l'&icirc;le

voisine de Santo Ant&atilde;o. Cette ville s'est actuellement

&eacute;quip&eacute;e de plusieurs unit&eacute;s de dessalement

de l'eau de mer, la plupart venant d'Isra&euml;l, qui l'alimentent

&agrave; cent pour cent. La fourniture d'eau comme celle d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;

est g&eacute;r&eacute;e par la soci&eacute;t&eacute; publique

Electra qui avait b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; dans le cadre

du FED (Fonds europ&eacute;en de D&eacute;veloppement) d'une aide

de la Commission europ&eacute;enne pour augmenter ses capacit&eacute;s

en &eacute;lectricit&eacute; en se dotant, de trois &eacute;oliennes

de fabrication danoise qui fournissent &agrave; elles seules 13

% de la consommation non industrielle de l'&icirc;le. Le dessalement

de l'eau de mer, les &eacute;oliennes, toutes solutions consid&eacute;r&eacute;es

ailleurs comme irr&eacute;alistes. Pour cent soixante mille personnes

sans une goutte d'eau, le r&eacute;alisme est parfois un luxe.



<P>

Si l'&icirc;le de Santiago qui abrite la capitale Praia n'est

pas aussi d&eacute;pourvue de sources naturelles d'eau, ses ressources

hydriques sont loin d'&ecirc;tre suffisantes pour son approvisionnement.

L'un des projets financ&eacute;s r&eacute;cemment par l'Union

europ&eacute;enne a pris en charge l'am&eacute;lioration des r&eacute;seaux

de distribution d'eau, l'assainissement et le drainage des eaux

pluviales. Ces travaux concernent entre autres le recyclage des

eaux us&eacute;es que l'&icirc;le ne peut se permettre de perdre.

Le point faible du Cap vert est certainement le manque d'eau.

Son point fort, sans conteste, le dynamisme de sa population.



<P>

A la D&eacute;l&eacute;gation de la Commission au Cap-vert, on

consid&egrave;re que les interventions &agrave; Praia, relatives

&agrave; la distribution et &agrave; l'assainissement de l'eau

et ceux de soutien aux quartiers pauvres de la capitale menac&eacute;s

de surpeuplement parall&egrave;lement au d&eacute;peuplement d'autres

r&eacute;gions du pays, sont symboliques de la volont&eacute;

de l'UE de tenir compte simultan&eacute;ment de cette faiblesse

et de cette force, et sont repr&eacute;sentatives de la vocation

de l'aide communautaire dans ce pays. De fa&ccedil;on g&eacute;n&eacute;rale,

cette aide se concentre sur les infrastructures - production et

distribution d'eau et d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;, am&eacute;nagement

urbain - d'une part et sur la formation et la sant&eacute; d'autre

part.

<P>

Le centre historique de Praia, &quot;le Plateau&quot; riche d'une

belle architecture coloniale et n&eacute;o-classique est en train

de perdre beaucoup de ses constructions abandonn&eacute;es par

des propri&eacute;taires incapables de les entretenir. L'aide

communautaire s'est port&eacute;e sur ce patrimoine en perdition.

Elle serait insuffisante pour financer la r&eacute;novation du

Plateau, mais &agrave; l'instar du gouvernement capverdien qui

a maintenu dans un tr&egrave;s bon &eacute;tat les b&acirc;timents

administratifs ou de l'exemplaire r&eacute;novation du si&egrave;ge

du Centre culturel fran&ccedil;ais, la Commission va probablement

prendre en charge la r&eacute;novation d'une superbe b&acirc;tisse

du si&egrave;cle pass&eacute;e, la &quot;Casa Cor-de-Rosa&quot;

pas seulement pour la restaurer mais pour en faire le coeur d'un

projet plus global de formation de professionnels du b&acirc;timent

&agrave; la restauration, et d'incitation &agrave; la sauvegarde

du centre historique, destin&eacute; &agrave; servir d'exemple

pour les futurs acqu&eacute;reurs, institutions, entreprises et

particuliers, parmi ces derniers, les &eacute;migr&eacute;s qui

alimentent en grande partie l'entreprise du b&acirc;timent.

<P>

La Communaut&eacute; a financ&eacute; une &eacute;tude de sauvegarde

du Centre historique de la capitale qui a servi de guide &agrave;

la Municipalit&eacute; de Praia. Un projet d'un million d'Ecu,

entrant dans le projet global d'am&eacute;nagement de la ville

de Praia, en cours actuellement, aide celle-ci &agrave; r&eacute;aliser

une op&eacute;ration pilote, la restauration d'un &icirc;lot,

dont le but premier est la formation de techniciens capverdiens.

Encore dans le domaine de la formation, ont &eacute;t&eacute;

r&eacute;alis&eacute;s les travaux de construction de l'Ecole

technique de Praia. La phase suivante, d'un montant de pr&egrave;s

d'un million d'ECU doit financer la fourniture d'&eacute;quipements

et la formation d'enseignants. 

<P>

Toujours dans le cadre du projet global d'am&eacute;nagement de

la ville de Praia, un projet du FED d'un montant d'1,3 million

d'ECU est consacr&eacute; &agrave; l'am&eacute;nagement d'une

zone destin&eacute;e &agrave; accueillir un site industriel. Un

projet d'&eacute;lectrification rurale dans les environs de Praia

s'est vu allou&eacute; &agrave; la fin de l'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re

un budget d'un million et demi d'ECU. Il b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera

&agrave; une population de sept mille cinq cents personnes vivant

dans les trois centres ruraux les plus peupl&eacute;s de l'&icirc;le

de Santiago. La r&eacute;alisation technique des travaux sera

confi&eacute;e &agrave; l'entreprise publique Electra, le priv&eacute;

se chargeant de la fourniture d'&eacute;quipements et de la surveillance

des travaux.

<P>

<H3>La &quot;capverdianit&eacute;&quot; comme ressource</H3>

<P>

Les dirigeants du Cap vert insistent r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement

sur la richesse que constitue ce qu'ils appellent la capverdianit&eacute;

pour un pays aussi pauvre que le leur. De fait, ce pays, malgr&eacute;

des moyens limit&eacute;s d&eacute;ploient beaucoup d'&eacute;nergie

et d'ing&eacute;niosit&eacute; &agrave; &quot;cultiver&quot; sa

culture. Deux projets financ&eacute;s dans le cadre du Programme

indicatif national de ce pays et totalisant un demi-million d'ECU

concernent deux longs m&eacute;trages cin&eacute;matographiques,

ils devront contribuer &agrave; rompre l'isolement des &icirc;les

en faisant mieux conna&icirc;tre sa culture et son peuple &agrave;

l'&eacute;tranger. Le premier film tourn&eacute; durant l'ann&eacute;e

1995 &quot;Ilheu de contenda&quot; constitue le premier long m&eacute;trage

de fiction du Cap vert. C'est l'oeuvre du r&eacute;alisateur Le&atilde;o

Lopes inspir&eacute; de l'ouvrage d'un autre enfant du pays, Teixeira

de Sousa, centr&eacute; sur l'histoire du Cap vert et la gen&egrave;se

de son identit&eacute; nationale. La participation du FED (environ

250 mille ECUS) correspond &agrave; 14% du montant total de la

production. Ce film est actuellement diffus&eacute; dans certains

pays europ&eacute;ens. C'est &agrave; quelques milliers d'ECU

pr&egrave;s la m&ecirc;me participation qui est prise dans une

autre production, d'un r&eacute;alisateur portugais cette fois,

Francisco Manso, mais bas&eacute;e sur un roman d'un auteur capverdien,

Germano de Almeida &quot;O testamento do Sr. Napuceno&quot;, dont

le tournage se faisait sur l'&icirc;le de S&atilde;o Vicente au

moment de notre visite. Ce film est financ&eacute; pour moiti&eacute;

par des producteurs portugais, les autres coproducteurs sont fran&ccedil;ais

et belge. 

<P>

Parmi les autres projets du FED r&eacute;alis&eacute;s r&eacute;cemment

ou en cours de r&eacute;alisation, on peut retenir celui d'am&eacute;lioration

des infrastructures routi&egrave;res (3 MECU) des &icirc;les de

Santiago, S. Nicolau et Maio et un programme de micror&eacute;alisations

d'un million d'ECU. En plus du Fonds europ&eacute;en de d&eacute;veloppement,

Le Cap Vert a re&ccedil;u, dans le cadre de la Convention de Lom&eacute;,

d'autres financements, dont 700.000 ECU au titre des transferts

Stabex pour les pertes subies dans le secteur de la banane durant

l'ann&eacute;e 1994.

<P>

<H3>Dessine-moi un micro-climat </H3>

<P>

La faiblesse de la production qui ne couvre qu'une petite partie

de la consommation rend imp&eacute;rative l'aide alimentaire ext&eacute;rieure.

La derni&egrave;re intervention du Budget Aide alimentaire de

la Commission se chiffrait &agrave; pr&egrave;s de deux millions

d'ECU. D'autres lignes budg&eacute;taires sp&eacute;ciales interviennenet

comme celle de&quot;Droits de l'Homme et d&eacute;mocratisation

dans les PVD.&quot;

<P>

Pour un voyageur &eacute;tranger attentif, l'une des r&eacute;alisations

les plus int&eacute;ressantes du Cap Vert est le progr&egrave;s

du reboisement sur un sol tellement ingrat. L'un de ces aires

de reboisement, d'une superficie de cinq mille hectares r&eacute;alis&eacute;

de 1990 &agrave; 1994 sert justement de base &agrave; un projet

r&eacute;gional de diffusion du savoir-faire accumul&eacute; dans

ce domaine au Cap Vert. Des stages de formation ont permis &agrave;

des techniciens et &agrave; d'autres personnes impliqu&eacute;es

dans la reforestation dans les pays du Sahel d'apprivoiser les

m&eacute;thodes qui ont fait leurs preuves ici. La production

et la diffusion d'outils p&eacute;dagogiques - livres, affiches,

films, etc - compl&egrave;tent le projet. Le Cap Vert est parvenu

depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance &agrave; d&eacute;cupler sa superficie

bois&eacute;e, c'est vrai qu'il &eacute;tait parti de peu, mais

les conditions climatiques &eacute;tant si difficiles, ce r&eacute;sultat

peut s'assimiler &agrave; un exploit. On se met m&ecirc;me &agrave;

esp&eacute;rer l'apparition de micro-climat. Dans l'&icirc;le

de Santiago, sur certains de ces nouveaux espaces verts, les canards

sauvages qui avaient disparu depuis longtemps sont revenus. Il

ne faut pas prendre un canard sauvage pour un enfant du bon Dieu,

mais on peut r&ecirc;ver.

Coop&eacute;ration UE-Kenya</h2>

<p>

<H4>par <i>Debra Percival</i></H4>

<P>

<h4>Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>le Courrier ACP-UE</i><br>no. 157,

mai-juin 1996: pages 35 - 36</h4>

<h5>(N.B.: Ce texte peut diverger quelque peu de la version originale)

</h5><a href="../index_uf.htm">page EUFORIC</a><br>

<a href="http://europa.eu.int/en/comm/dg08/dgviii.htm" target="_top">page DG VIII</a>

<br>



</center><hr>

<B>Les domaines prioritaires de la coop&eacute;ration entre l'Union

europ&eacute;enne et le Kenya ont &eacute;t&eacute;, au fil des

diff&eacute;rentes Conventions &agrave; partir de Lom&eacute;

I en 1975, le d&eacute;veloppement rural et l'autosuffisance alimentaire,

de m&ecirc;me que, dans une moindre mesure, l'&eacute;nergie,

le commerce et l'industrie, la sant&eacute; et l'&eacute;ducation.

Le programme des micror&eacute;alisations a traditionnellement

&eacute;t&eacute;, lui aussi, un volet important de cette coop&eacute;ration

et la onzi&egrave;me tranche vient d'en &ecirc;tre annonc&eacute;e.

</B>

<P>

Etant donn&eacute; qu'il tire la plus grande partie de ses recettes

&agrave; l'exportation de produits tels que le th&eacute; et le

caf&eacute;, le Kenya a largement b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;

du Stabex, ce syst&egrave;me qui contribue &agrave; compenser

les pertes subies par les grands secteurs d'exportations agricoles

lors d'une chute des prix sur les march&eacute;s mondiaux.

<P>

Au niveau r&eacute;gional, le r&eacute;seau routier, qui permet

aux voisins du Kenya d'acc&eacute;der au port de Mombasa, reste

un domaine prioritaire de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement

de l'UE, le Kenya lui-m&ecirc;me trouvant &eacute;videmment son

compte dans ce contexte.

<P>

L'assistance communautaire au Kenya a &eacute;t&eacute; touch&eacute;e

depuis 1991 par les tensions politiques survenues dans les relations

de ce pays avec la Banque mondiale et le FMI. Lors de la r&eacute;union

du Groupe consultatif en novembre 1991, les donateurs ont d&eacute;cid&eacute;

de suspendre leur aide &agrave; d&eacute;boursement rapide au

Kenya car ils n'&eacute;taient pas satisfaits des progr&egrave;s

accomplis en termes de droits de l'homme, de bonne gestion de

l'Etat et de r&eacute;forme &eacute;conomique. Cette d&eacute;cision

signifiait la perte d'un apport d'aide &eacute;valu&eacute; &agrave;

40 millions de dollars par mois. Cette situation s'est r&eacute;percut&eacute;e

sur l'assistance de l'UE dans le cadre de projets visant &agrave;

l'ajustement de l'&eacute;conomie, et plus particuli&egrave;rement

la r&eacute;forme du secteur des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales que devaient

soutenir Lom&eacute; III et IV. Les relations se sont am&eacute;lior&eacute;es

au cours de l'ann&eacute;e 1993 mais l'avancement des r&eacute;formes

structurelles reste sous haute surveillance, et une attention

particuli&egrave;re est accord&eacute;e aux droits de l'homme

et aux questions de d&eacute;mocratie.

<P>

<B>Lom&eacute; I et II</B> 

<P>

La plus grande partie de l'allocation de 72 millions ECU octroy&eacute;e

au titre de Lom&eacute; I (1976-1980) a &eacute;t&eacute; consacr&eacute;e

au d&eacute;veloppement rural et &agrave; l'&eacute;nergie, et

notamment au vaste projet de l'Upper Tana Reservoir (26,3 millions

ECU). Un montant de 20 millions a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;

au MIDP (Machakos Integrated Development Programme), destin&eacute;

&agrave; am&eacute;liorer le rendement agricole, la gestion de

l'eau et du sol et le niveau g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de vie. On

peut citer, parmi les autres projets, le renforcement des services

relatifs aux animaux dans la Province littorale, l'appui aux ateliers

ruraux et la contribution &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des conditions

de vie &agrave; Kawangware et dans la Mathare Valley dans l'agglom&eacute;ration

de Nairobi.

<P>

Le Kenya a &eacute;t&eacute; le principal b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire

ACP des pr&ecirc;ts de la BEI (Banque europ&eacute;enne d'Investissement)

au titre de Lom&eacute; I. Un montant total de 53,6 millions lui

a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute; dans ce contexte en vue du

financement du barrage de Masinga, de la Kenya Tea Development

Authority, de la Development Finance Corporation et de l'Industrial

Development Bank, entre autres.

<P>

Les micror&eacute;alisations ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&egrave;s

le d&eacute;part une composante majeure de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement

de l'UE au Kenya. Il s'agit de projets bas&eacute;s sur l'auto-assistance

: l'ex&eacute;cution en incombe &agrave; la population locale

mais le financement est largement assur&eacute; par l'UE. Un montant

de 2,4 millions ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute; aux micror&eacute;alisations

dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; I avec une priorit&eacute; pour le

mat&eacute;riel et l'&eacute;quipement scolaires, les petits projets

d'irrigation et les projets li&eacute;s &agrave; la distribution

de l'eau.

<P>

Les principaux projets r&eacute;gionaux d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s

au titre de la premi&egrave;re Convention ont port&eacute; sur

la construction d'une liaison routi&egrave;re entre Lodwar (nord-ouest

du Kenya) et Juba au Soudan, ainsi que sur le renforcement du

r&eacute;seau d'aviation civile et de t&eacute;l&eacute;communications

couvrant les &icirc;les de l'Oc&eacute;an indien, la Corne de

l'Afrique et l'Afrique de l'Est.

<P>

Un montant de 88 millions ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;vu

dans le cadre du Programme indicatif national (PIN) de Lom&eacute;

II pour la p&eacute;riode 1980-1985. Il a notamment servi &agrave;

la poursuite du MIDP tandis qu'un projet de grande envergure &eacute;tait

entrepris en vue de la r&eacute;habilitation de la production

de riz au Kenya occidental (Province de Nyanza), dans les vall&eacute;es

mar&eacute;cageuses du district de Kisii. L'objectif &eacute;tait

l'expansion des terres agricoles dans cette r&eacute;gion particuli&egrave;rement

peupl&eacute;e. Les pr&ecirc;ts de la BEI se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s

&agrave; 47 millions ECU au cours de cette m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode.

Les fonds r&eacute;gionaux ont &agrave; nouveau &eacute;t&eacute;

ax&eacute;s sur le transport avec une priorit&eacute; &agrave;

l'am&eacute;lioration du Corridor du Nord qui relie Mombasa avec

l'Ouganda, le Rwanda, le Za&iuml;re et le Soudan. Une aide au

titre &quot;r&eacute;gional&quot; a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute;

fournie &agrave; des projets de recherche destin&eacute;s &agrave;

lutter contre les insectes migrants d'Afrique de l'Est ainsi qu'&agrave;

des campagnes contre la mouche ts&eacute;-ts&eacute;.

<P>

<B>Lom&eacute; III : lenteur d'ex&eacute;cution</B> 

<P>

Le PIN de Lom&eacute; III (1985-1990) affectait 128 millions ECU

aux programmes et projets de d&eacute;veloppement, ainsi que 7

millions suppl&eacute;mentaires &agrave; une facilit&eacute; sp&eacute;ciale

d'all&egrave;gement de la dette. Ce PIN a &eacute;t&eacute; consacr&eacute;

&agrave; 80 % au d&eacute;veloppement rural, et plus particuli&egrave;rement

&agrave; la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire et l'auto-suffisance

- le solde de 20 % allant &agrave; des projets dans le secteur

du commerce, de l'industrie, du transport et des communications.

<P>

La mise en oeuvre a &eacute;t&eacute; laborieuse. Le programme

de soutien au secteur des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales (23 millions

ECU) a &eacute;t&eacute; suspendu, l'avancement des r&eacute;formes

&eacute;tant jug&eacute; trop lent. Un projet de recensement du

cheptel et la mise en oeuvre d'un projet agricole de base &agrave;

Isiolo ont &eacute;galement enregistr&eacute; certains retards,

bien qu'ils semblent aujourd'hui bien repartis.

<P>

Le KARI (Kenya Agricultural Research Institute) pourrait b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier

d'une partie du solde de Lom&eacute; III mais des &quot;conditionnalit&eacute;s

sectorielles&quot; pourraient &ecirc;tre appliqu&eacute;es aux

futurs versements. Elles s'inscriraient dans la rationalisation

pr&eacute;vue par le programme de r&eacute;forme &eacute;conomique

de trois ans publi&eacute; en f&eacute;vrier en collaboration

avec le FMI et la Banque mondiale.

<P>

Les versements au titre de la neuvi&egrave;me et de la dixi&egrave;me

tranche du programme de micror&eacute;alisations se poursuivent

en d&eacute;pit de retards importants et de l'annonce d'un r&eacute;examen

&quot;financier et technique&quot; dans ce domaine. Les pr&ecirc;ts

de la BEI au Kenya dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; III concernent

notamment la modernisation du port de Mombasa, le d&eacute;veloppement

du secteur du th&eacute;, l'appui au secteur industriel et l'am&eacute;lioration

de la distribution d'eau &agrave; Nairobi.

<P>

L'un des grands projets r&eacute;gionaux de Lom&eacute; III a

&eacute;t&eacute; la r&eacute;habilitation de 103 km de l'axe

routier entre Nairobi et la fronti&egrave;re ougandaise. Des ressources

d'un montant de 50,9 millions ECU ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;bloqu&eacute;es

&agrave; cette fin dans le cadre du programme national et r&eacute;gional.

<P>

<B>Lom&eacute; IV va de l'avant</B> 

<P>

Le PIN de 140 millions ECU d&eacute;cid&eacute; pour le Kenya

au titre de Lom&eacute; IV a &eacute;t&eacute; revu en 1995 avec

la signature d'un protocole d'accord tenant compte des nouvelles

r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques entreprises par le gouvernement.

Cette r&eacute;orientation a eu pour cons&eacute;quence principale,

comme d&eacute;j&agrave; indiqu&eacute;, de r&eacute;orienter

les fonds vers la remise en &eacute;tat des routes (voir article

&agrave; ce sujet en page 34). Les domaines cl&eacute;s touch&eacute;s

par l'actualisation du programme - allant jusqu'&agrave; l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance

de Lom&eacute; IV, &agrave; savoir l'an 2000 - sont la conservation

des ressources naturelles, le d&eacute;veloppement des ressources

humaines, l'appui au secteur priv&eacute; et le support institutionnel.

<P>

Plusieurs projets avaient toutefois &eacute;t&eacute; approuv&eacute;s

avant la signature de ce protocole d'accord. Ils portent notamment

sur une phase pr&eacute;paratoire dans le secteur routier (1,69

million ECU), sur une contribution &agrave; la r&eacute;habilitation

des tron&ccedil;ons Mukuyu-Isebania et St Austin-Kabate (4,97

millions ECU), sur la protection et la gestion de la for&ecirc;t

indig&egrave;ne (4,4 millions ECU), sur le programme de conservation

des &eacute;l&eacute;phants et de la faune et flore sauvages (4

millions ECU), sur un programme culturel swahili (1,99 million

ECU), sur le r&eacute;tablisessement de services-conseils (1,95

million ECU), sur des micror&eacute;alisations (5,5 millions ECU)

et sur une contribution du PIN aux programmes r&eacute;gionaux

(8,7 millions ECU).

<P>

Parmi les d&eacute;penses r&eacute;cemment approuv&eacute;es figurent

un programme de promotion commerciale g&eacute;r&eacute; par l'Export

Promotion Council (4 millions ECU), un programme de sant&eacute;

familiale (11,45 millions ECU), des r&eacute;parations urgentes

sur la liaison routi&egrave;re Nairobi-Mombasa (2 millions ECU),

des subventions au d&eacute;partement charg&eacute; de la gestion

des projets (1,45 million ECU) et &agrave; la KIPPRA (1,98 million

ECU), un programme de d&eacute;veloppement touristique (2 millions

ECU), un fonds pour le d&eacute;veloppement des communaut&eacute;s

locales (12,5 millions ECU) et un projet de promotion des micro-entreprises

(6 millions ECU). Les cr&eacute;dits de la BEI au titre de Lom&eacute;

IV ont &eacute;t&eacute; largement affect&eacute;s &agrave; ce

jour au d&eacute;veloppement des entreprises priv&eacute;es.

<P>

Enfin, toujours au titre de Lom&eacute; IV, des fonds r&eacute;gionaux

ont &eacute;t&eacute; allou&eacute;s &agrave; des projets routiers

suppl&eacute;mentaires, &agrave; la r&eacute;insertion de ressortissants

africains qualifi&eacute;s dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et &agrave;

l'intensification de la lutte contre le SIDA/VIH et les maladies

sexuellement transmissibles. Cette derni&egrave;re action a inclus

la r&eacute;novation de la clinique sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e

dans les MST au centre de Nairobi, ainsi que la mise en place

de services de laboratoire et de conseils. Deux projets &eacute;taient

&agrave; l'&eacute;tude au moment de mettre <I>Le Courrier</I>

sous presse : l'aide &agrave; l'agriculture dans les r&eacute;gions

infest&eacute;es par la mouche ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; (1,5 million

ECU) et le financement d'un r&eacute;seau agro-forestier sur les

hauts plateaux d'Afrique orientale (1 million ECU).

<P>

<B>Le Stabex</B> 

<P>

Le Kenya a re&ccedil;u pr&egrave;s de 127 millions ECU entre 1987

et 1993 au titre du Stabex mais l'acheminement de ces fonds vers

des projets ad&eacute;quats a &eacute;t&eacute; retard&eacute;

par les changements de politique &eacute;conomique survenus depuis

1991. Les ressources du Stabex seront d&eacute;sormais orient&eacute;es

vers les routes secondaires, les recherches relatives au caf&eacute;,

les travaux d'&eacute;lectrification et l'assistance technique.

<P>

Outre l'aide qui vient d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;crite, l'UE a octroy&eacute;

au fil des ann&eacute;es des montants importants &agrave; des

ONG op&eacute;rant au Kenya. La Commission a soutenu toute une

s&eacute;rie de projets dans ce contexte, notamment dans le secteur

de la sant&eacute; et de l'&eacute;ducation. Le Kenya a &eacute;galement

b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; d'allocations majeures en termes

d'aide alimentaire.

Coop&eacute;ration Mali - UE<br>

Routes et ajustement</h2>

par <i>Theo Hoorntje</i>

<h4>Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>le Courrier ACP-UE</i><br>no. 159,

septembre-octobre 1996: page 28</h4>

<h5>(N.B.: Ce texte peut diverger quelque peu de la version originale)

</center><hr>

<P>

<B>Pour la p&eacute;riode 1990-95, avec 151,7 millions d'&eacute;cu

(MECU), les montants inscrits au  Programme indicatif national

(PIN) du 7&egrave;me Fonds europ&eacute;en de d&eacute;veloppement

(FED) - c'est-&agrave;-dire l'aide aux projets - ont repr&eacute;sent&eacute;

chaque ann&eacute;e environ 1,5 % du PIB et 13 % du Programme

d'investissement public du Mali. Quant aux fonds acquis hors PIN

- aides exceptionnelles, Stabex, capitaux &agrave; risques de

la Banque europ&eacute;enne d'investissement (BEI) et facilit&eacute;

d'ajustement structurel - ils se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave;

87,2  MECU pour ces cinq ann&eacute;es.</B>

<P>

 En 1995, l'appui au programme d'ajustement structurel a repr&eacute;sent&eacute;

5,4 % du d&eacute;ficit de la balance des paiements courants et

7,8 % du d&eacute;ficit budg&eacute;taire. Tous instruments confondus,

le montant des d&eacute;cisions de financement prises par la Commission

au cours de l'ann&eacute;e derni&egrave;re a atteint 42 MECU tandis

que celui des d&eacute;boursements s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve &agrave;

40 MECU.

<P>

 Le taux d'engagement primaire du PIN (7&egrave;me FED) est pass&eacute;

de 76 % en d&eacute;but d'exercice &agrave; 92 % en fin d'ann&eacute;e,

ce qui signifie que la presque totalit&eacute; des ressources

programmables disponibles est maintenant affect&eacute;e &agrave;

des projets et programmes. Quant aux taux d'engagement secondaire,

c'est-&agrave;-dire la traduction des  projets/programmes en march&eacute;s,

devis et contrats, elle est pass&eacute; de 33 &agrave; 45 % en

fin d'exercice.  Les taux de d&eacute;boursement demeurent donc

faibles (32 % des ressources disponibles).

<P>

<B>Orientations</B>

<P>

 La r&eacute;partition des interventions dans les diff&eacute;rents

secteurs est la suivante:

<ul>

<li>Routes (29 % du total);

<li>Appui &agrave; l'ajustement structurel (20 %);

<li>D&eacute;veloppement rural /Environne-ment (14 %);

<li>Appui au secteur priv&eacute; (12 %);

<li>D&eacute;centralisation (9 %);

<li>Sant&eacute; publique (9 %);

<li>Hydraulique (4 %);

<li>Education/Culture (3 %).</ul>

<P>

 On peut donc constater que l'aide communautaire se concentre

en priorit&eacute; sur les infrastructures routi&egrave;res -

entretien des routes et d&eacute;senclavement. L'appui &agrave;

l'ajustement structurel vient en deuxi&egrave;me position qui

contribue au financement des d&eacute;penses courantes du budget

de l'Etat, un accent particulier &eacute;tant mis sur l'am&eacute;lioration

des recettes fiscales et douani&egrave;res et une plus grande

efficacit&eacute; de la politique de sant&eacute;.

<P>

 Dans d'autres domaines, comme le d&eacute;veloppement rural,

l'aide communautaire tente &eacute;galement de consolider les

acquis des actions ant&eacute;rieures, notamment par le d&eacute;veloppement

de fili&egrave;res rizicoles et d'&eacute;levage qui devraient

am&eacute;liorer l'approvisionnement du march&eacute; int&eacute;rieur

 et les possibilit&eacute;s d'exportations. En mati&egrave;re

d'environnement, l'objectif est de contribuer &agrave; la gestion

durable des ressources naturelles par les utilisateurs de base

que sont les agriculteurs, &eacute;leveurs, etc.

<P>

 Le soutien au secteur priv&eacute;, quant &agrave; lui, se fait

au travers d'actions dans les domaines de concentration et le

programme d'appui &agrave; un &eacute;tablissement financier 

(Cr&eacute;dit Initiative SA), r&eacute;cemment cr&eacute;&eacute;

en vue de la promotion d'octroi de cr&eacute;dits aux PME, s'ins&egrave;re

parfaitement dans l'objectif global de la croissance &eacute;conomique.

<P>

 Dans le cadre de la r&eacute;forme administrative, priorit&eacute;

est donn&eacute;e au processus de d&eacute;centralisation qui

vise &agrave; favoriser l'&eacute;mergence de nouveaux centres

de d&eacute;cision locaux - qui devraient &agrave; terme devenir

les acteurs cl&eacute;s dans la mise en oeuvre et le d&eacute;veloppement

des projets - et &agrave; doter ces instances d&eacute;centralis&eacute;es

des moyens n&eacute;cessaires pour remplir ces nouvelles missions

de service public.

<P>

 Dans le domaine de la sant&eacute;, la contribution de l'aide

communautaire s'est concr&eacute;tis&eacute;e par une participation

au projet PSPHR, financ&eacute; par d'autres bailleurs de fonds

et se concentre, dans un premier temps, sur les infrastructures

et la politique des m&eacute;dicaments essentiels.

<P>

 Dans le secteur de l'hydraulique, les actions visent au renforcement

des infrastructures de l'hydraulique villageoise, notamment dans

les cercles de Bankass et Koro.  Un programme de pompes solaires

a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; mis en oeuvre dans les r&eacute;gions

de Mopti et de Koulikoro.

<P>

 Pour ce qui est du secteur de l'&eacute;ducation et de la culture,

outre un programme de reconstruction d'&eacute;coles dans le nord

du pays, la Commission a pu apporter son appui &agrave; la r&eacute;alisation

d'une douzaine de productions cin&eacute;matographiques.

<P>

 Sur les ressources non programmables, les interventions ont concern&eacute;

un appui suppl&eacute;mentaire &agrave; l'ajustement structurel,

le Stabex, les reliquats du 5&egrave;me FED, les projets de la

BEI (Cmdt, Huicoma, Cr&eacute;dit Initiative-SA, Sadiola) et des

actions d'urgence dans les r&eacute;gions du nord du pays o&ugrave;,

malgr&eacute; un contexte difficile, les programmes n'ont jamais

&eacute;t&eacute; interrompus.

<P>

 Enfin, l'aide communautaire est pr&eacute;sente dans les programmes

r&eacute;gionaux comme la lutte contre la peste bovine, la r&eacute;habilitation

des routes, la formation et l'information &agrave; la protection

de l'environnement.

<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by</i> <a href="oda_info.html">Overseas Development Administration</a>
<hr>
<h2>Learning for life</h2>
<p>
Kamala's parents in Andhra Pradesh cannot help with her homework. Like almost half the people in this part of India they are illiterate. But six-year-old Kamala has opportunities her parents never had. She goes to school regularly now thanks to the ODA's largest education project - the Andhra Pradesh Primary Education Project. 
So far over 3,000 classrooms have been built and over 165,000 teachers have been trained and there are signs that fewer children are dropping out of school. 
<p>
Over the last decade many developing countries have spent their money on more immediate needs. But education, especially literacy, is one of the cornerstones of development.  Skills like literacy and numeracy change the way people see their world and help them to learn about vital issues such as health, political and social life, and the environment. 
<p>
A good basic education also equips people for further training and fulfilling work and enables them to play a more constructive role in the community. Educated girls and women can make informed choices about how many children they really want. 
In 1994, about half the world's children had had less than four years in primary school. Millions of people in developing countries do not learn to read or write. Dilapidated schoolrooms, badly trained teachers and poor learning materials hold children back even when they do attend class.  
<p>
The ODA is working harder than ever to help developing countries overcome these problems.  In 1993/94, total aid for education came to £117 million. This money is distributed according to a new global policy on education. Its driving force is support for basic education for children and adults.<p>
<p>
<b>New projects agreed under the policy include:</b>
<p>
<ul><li>in Zambia, a £12 million project aimed at raising standards of education in primary and secondary schools
<p>  
<li>in Egypt, a £2.5 milllion adult literacy project aimed specifically at women.
</ul><p> 
The ODA works, in concert with other donors, to help improve national education systems. It aims to help countries find ways of reaching the whole population, including disadvantaged groups like  young girls and people living in remote areas.
<p>
The ODA also funds training ranging from teaching to car mechanics, either in Britain or in developing countries. In 1993/94, the ODA supported the studies of over 10,000 overseas students in Britain. Although it is not a priority within its overall education policy, the ODA also helps universities and institutes overseas as well to improve their performance or management, or  increase the number of women students.
<p>
<b>Books</b>
<br>
Books - classroom basics - are in such short supply in some countries that 'book famines' are common. Britain helps keep book supplies steady in developing countries in several ways. 
<p>
The ODA gives some books directly to developing countries to fill specific gaps - several thousand college-level agricultural textbooks, for example. For a few decades the ODA has also supported the Educational Low-priced Books Scheme, which sells British textbooks at low prices to overseas students, and Book Aid International (formerly the Ranfurly Library Service) which distributes a broad range of donated books free to developing countries. 
<p>
In 1993/94 the ODA gave £216,000 and £15,000, respectively, to these programmes.
<p>
The British Council manages most of the ODA's education and training projects. It also receives a large grant to pay for its other activities in support of ODA's mission.
<p>
<b>Adult literacy</b>
<br>
Learning to read and write can often lift adults out of poverty to a new status, income and independence. The ODA funds many projects that encourage adult literacy, ranging from distance learning for people in isolated areas with no schools, to support for non-governmental organisations working at community level. 
<p>
In Malawi fewer than half the girls enrol in school and there is one teacher for every 80 pupils. The ODA is working closely with the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank on a seven year project to improve the availability of primary school education for girls and generally raise the quality of education.  
<p>
British experts help developing countries to write, produce and publish their own textbooks that meet local needs. In Jamaica, for example, teams of teachers on the Secondary Schools Textbook Project are writing materials for pupils who have difficulty reading English. Textbooks cover mathematics, English, science and social studies. Britain supports similar projects in Sierra Leone and Jordan.

All were detained because they had joineda pro-independence demonstration. Among them was Ngawang Choekyi, a 25-year-oldnun. She was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and sent to Drapchi prison.<P>Since then Ngawang's sentence has been increased by eight years. She was one of14 nuns who were tried again in 1993, while still serving their sentences, forhaving composed and recorded pro-independence songs in prison. She is not due forrelease until 2005. <P>The songs were recorded on a tape recorder smuggled into theprison. The tape was then circulated secretly in Tibet. On the tape the 14 nunsannounce their names and dedicate a song or poem to their friends and supporters."All of you outside who have done all that you can for us in prison, we aredeeply grateful to you and we will never forget you," sings one nun. "We arebeaten and treated brutally," sings another, "but this will never change theTibetan people's perseverance." <P>The authorities apparently considered thedistribution of the tapes to be "spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda", anoffence which normally carries a maximum of five years' imprisonment, but can bepunished by longer sentences when the accused are considered to be"ring-leaders".<P>Women make up about one third of the political prisoners known tobe held in Tibet. The number of women political prisoners has reportedly tripledin the past three years. In 1994 there were apparently 68 women prisoners inDrapchi, compared with 23 in 1991. All but two are nuns arrested for stagingsmall-scale independence demonstrations. <HR><A HREF="china4.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="cchina.gif">Previous page</A><p><hr><a href="../index.html"><img align=bottom src="../amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif"> Amnesty International Home Page</a><br clear=all><hr></BODY></HTML>

<TR><TD><B>When I became involved in the Pure Genius occupation I was working for a Borough Council's Engineering Consultancy and living in a squat in Hackney. I am opposed to the building of the Newbury Bypass and had been actively involved in the protests along the route. I heard of plans to occupy a derelict site in the city for a week and was interested  as it presented the opportunity to demonstrate a positive side of the direct action movement. 

<P>

Different groups spend much of their time in retrospective campaigning to stop this or that development. Often because another part of our disappearing natural wealth is threatened and too few people cared to take action early enough. So we get TV pictures of protesters up trees whilst the police, industrialists and politicians talk about the cost to the country of the action as if the protesters were committing treason.

<P>

Politicians and business people are great at giving lip service to the need for sustainability yet are apparently unwilling to take the actions necessary to move towards it.... It is only the actions of politicians that have the means to pass laws controlling the boundaries of business...... And it is increasingly only multinational or very large business that controls the resources which can  effect change on the scale necessary. 

<P>

It is generally excepted that much environmental destruction is caused directly or indirectly by the way we globally consume resources. The cities of the world are the places with the highest resource and energy consumption. If unchecked  unwise lifestyles will sooner or later lead to more and more global crisis, getting closer and closer to the homes of even the very rich. As societies and individuals we must produce huge changes in patterns of consumption.  

<P>

In urban areas these changes could come in the form of developments which are more people centred, that encourage the use of sustainable transport and energy systems, the recycling of materials and that reduce the costs of living to communities by cycling more of their wealth within themselves and therefore stop it disappearing into the global money market upon which it needs to be replaced by wages from artificial jobs which only increase consumption. The planning system allows for this to happen. But it is so often manipulated by land owners and developers who's interests are simply to make the largest profits possible.

<P>

This is why The Land Is Ours campaign's occupation of a derelict urban site highlighted so well the farcical nature of the current planning and economic systems and the lack of real will within influential companies to put sustainable ideas into practice..... To occupy a site with nothing of interest to anyone on it, that had been left empty and inaccessible for many years due to the fact that the owners simply wished to make a profit from it was a great idea..... That the developers who where employed had chosen to try and force planning permission through for an unwanted carpark and supermarket, the cheapest type of things to build for the largest returns, brilliant....The fact that the site was in a rare, prime riverside location in a European capital city and hence should be the perfect place in which to demonstrate the ideas of forward thinking sustainable urban development, an opportunity which had been ignored by the council planners, the city planners, the owners and the developers, Genius. After all it is so much easier to carry on doing what you have always done.

<P>

There are many other people who have chosen to have lifestyles which put into practice the ideas of sustainable living. By their very nature these low income, high quality lifestyles need the attention  and time of the folk involved which often means they can give less time to long term occupations and protests than they would wish. People could plan to be involved in this protest for a short period of time and be seen to be supporting a change in attitudes towards urban development and the manipulation of peoples possible futures which are so often dictated by the short sighted actions of those who hold the financial power for change in our cities. 

<P>

I decided to help out..... After the initial meetings, publicised in newspapers,  groups of people willing to take on various tasks had formed. I was to help with the buildings and materials gathering. There were about ten of us working on this when we could between work and other commitments. Different groups identified their needs, Jacqueline with her van, Brendan myself and others were out searching for sources of useful things as requested.  The date was set for the occupation and I had a vague idea of the sorts of materials that could be found and might be useful. The material gathering team had drop off points around the city and folk were out scanning the streets from the top decks of buses looking for piles of waste wood from demolitions. 

<P>

Octavaia's

We needed to build a big structure as a focus for the village. It was agreed to build a round house to take two hundred people. A simple sketch and a little thought and I had a list of timber sizes and lengths we were looking for and fixings we would need to hold it together safely. The building had to be flexible and able to be erected on hard or soft land as we still didn't know were we were going. Other buildings would have to be built from whatever was available. There was very little money to be spent, most of that would go on transport and food, some on the compost and materials for the gardens.

<P>

I was evicted from the flat I had been squatting with three friends, we had just started decorating. This gave me more opportunity to try new bus routes to work. Another friend offered the floor of a spare room, whilst moving our stuff round in a camper van the engine caught fire under our belongings. The fire extinguisher from an Indian takeaway saved the day, the omens were good, there were three weeks to go.

<P>

The wood for the roundhouse was finally located, Brendan had been bringing in bits from a mysterious source but there wasn't enough. Then on a bus up the A40 I spotted it, a huge pile from the demolition of the houses to widen the road. A quick visit from Jacqueline and I, some negotiations with the contractors and we had a truck load delivered to our storage space.   

<P>

We were still faced with a transport problem. I have not owned a vehicle for four years and there was only one, very busy, van between us and the piles for collection were growing, skips were going unemptied. Then late one evening the phone rang "I hear you need a van ?" a cheery voice said " If you can get to Norfolk its all yours for a few weeks.  My name's Ken." This was a problem, I was one of the few people that could drive but I was working every day and most of the other time was tied up with sorting out the materials for possible building work and preparing the timber for the roundhouse. I phoned back to try and get him to drive over to London, a yo-yo of telephone conversations followed, at last two days later it was resolved. Ken would come to help in a few days time. I slept well that night..... until the phone rang at four in the morning. It was Ken back from a night out celebrating his birthday, drunk and apologetically dialing the wrong number. Who was this weird guy? 

<P>

In the next few days I watched our piles of tat grow in our central storage. There was now a team of us working on the wood, Steve, Brendan, Gary, Nick and I sawing, shaping and piling a few hours here a few hours there. Yurt frames began to take shape as Anja provided the instructions to us. Spirits were high but there was no where near enough materials to provide shelter for the hundreds of people expected  and to deal with their waste. Jacqueline's van was increasingly busy with food and gardening materials. She was constantly collecting at any free moment in her own busy life. Piles of pallets and plastic barrels for bins were appearing day by day. 

<P>

Ken arrived bringing energy and enthusiasm he was the one of the many great people I would meet in the next few months. With the increased capacity to shift things the piles increased. Old sleepers arrived, plastic sheet from scaffold companies around the city, more pallets, plywood, guttering and pipe for the gardens. At last I felt we had what we needed to be sure the first few days would be constructive. Other people started to arrive with their contributions. The truck and coaches were arranged for moving everything in to the site. I had arranged the occupation week off work and was happy things were going to plan.

<P>

May 4th arrived and many other people gathered at the battlebridge. The truck was carefully loaded with all the materials for the roundhouse, gardens and the most essential composting toilets, the two vans were full to their weight limits with food, yurts, plastic sheet, tools and a scaffold tower. Travellers vehicles took still more things. There was still piles to be moved but they would have to wait for a second journey assuming we got in to the site.... Wherever it was. 

<P>

The material gatherers retired to the pub for a well earned rest. I just had to sleep, get up and find the meeting place on time in the morning.         

<P>

When I arrived at the small green in Hammersmith the next morning there were hundreds of people milling around. What was happening? Where were we going? Who knew what coach to get on?  Portable phones were stuck to ears and some sort of raffle was going on. It turned out this was tickets for the coaches. Slowly they were filling, but where was the truck with the materials in that I was supposed to get a lift in? Had the police decided to stop it as they had with other demonstrations in the past?, surely not.... 

<BR>

At last a phone rang, it was just coming down the road, London's great road network was just working as normal.

<P>

The convoy moved off, leaving still more people for second coach journeys. I could see bicycles moving amongst the traffic, waving at the coaches, excited faces peered through windows smiling. Passers by looked on, something not quite normal was going on. The vehicles headed south. I was apprehensive but excited, it was happening.... I was about to suffer a shock. 

<P>

We moved through Hammersmith, down towards the river and into Putney across the bridge. This was all familiar to me as I worked on a contract for the local council here. The coaches turned east along the south of the river, I began to have an uneasy feeling about possible destinations. Sure enough my worst fears were about to be confirmed. Wandsworth bridge appeared in front of us. As we pulled onto the roundabout I could see the coaches parked in front of the site and people getting out. We were waved past in the truck and into the gateway. Excited, smiling people looked up at the cab directing us on, happy laughter rose above the noise of the passing traffic...  Shit, I thought, I can see the office from here.

<P>

There was no time now to dwell on this. A brief welcome to the site and a meeting time was set. The back of the truck was opened and the unloading began. Piles of different timbers and materials that had taken three weeks to accumulate were reformed in seconds by masses of willing hands. I was kept busy making sure colour coded parts were all stacked together, meanwhile all around many more people were exploring the site. It was quite beautiful, behind the timber hoarding it had been forgotten and the scrubland was dotted with trees, shrubs and flowers almost like a secret garden. There was a sense of peace there, hidden from the busy road with the sounds of the river to one side. In the weeks to come I would often find this calm after the chaos of the city.

<P>

Unloading over, there was a little time before the meeting to find a place for the roundhouse. I thought that there was to be a short discussion about where to erect the different structures. But as I looked for the place that felt best to focus the village on I could see a huge dome already rising above the heads of it's builders. Meantime Steve, Gary and I found our spot. It was large enough for the roundhouse and left space all around for an outer circle of homes. There was a space to the west which was grassy and raised up perfect for watching a play or band in the roundhouse. I guestimated where the centre pole should go and scratched a cross in the ground.      

<P>      

The meeting started, various points were raised, where campers should pitch tents, which areas were to be left for wild life, where was potentially dangerous, phone locations for emergencies. There was a great level of excitement, we were here and in, the police had visited and had no problem, the site was owned by Guinness and was due to become a carpark and supermarket but the developers couldn't get planning permission and were taking it to a public enquiry. This was good news for me. If the site had been owned by the council I would have had big problems, If it had been granted planning permission I would also have a lot of explaining to do on the way to the dole office. I still had to go back to work in a weeks time where I was sure my colleagues would be very interested in what was going on.

<P>

In retrospect I think that more time should have been given from the start to laying out the site. There was a great momentum from different groups of people who all wanted to get on with erecting buildings and laying out gardens. But as most of the longer term dwellings had yet to be built and at this stage few people knew if they would be staying for longer than a week things just kept appearing here and there. In the longer term this was to mean that there was too much distance between different parts of the site and therefore it would be harder to keep an eye on everything and people would not be living or working so closely together. 

<P>

Back at the roundhouse site we began to dig the hole for the central post, the only bit which needed to go into the ground. Amazingly we had picked a point between two huge chunks of concrete a foot from each other with another piece about four foot down making the perfect foundation. Soon the post was up and by the end of the day the central section of the building was nearing completion. Steve and I spent much of the next three days working with a small group to get the rest of the frame up. Plywood was cut and nailed on the central roof and a tarpaulin formed temporary walls. Old light fittings found in Ken's van were nailed to four of the eight posts and filled with candles. As the sun set over Wandsworth bridge directly in front of the one open side it cast a golden light into the building. To me it took on the air of a temple, peaceful and calm with people sitting happily talking up plans for the rest of the site, playing music and reading poetry. 

<P>

The outer section began to appear, eleven more posts with beams and rafters leaving only the space where the sun came through in the evenings. From the roof there was a great view of the rest of the site. A fair few people had left after the bank holiday Monday but more were arriving every day drawn by the TV and newspaper coverage. There were Yurts, benders, tents, buses and wooden frames for houses. People carrying gardening equipment, plants and children. TV cameras and journalists appeared as if by magic out of bushes grabbing anyone passing. I began to feel a little frustrated by the lack of privacy and the constant questioning. Talking to other people they were having the same experiences, in the middle of carrying a large piece of wood from the wood pile or wheeling a barrow full of soil to a garden someone would stand in front of you and ask "what are you doing?" as if it wasn't obvious. 

<P>

I had ventured into the council office's on the Tuesday to confess my involvement in the occupation and to test the water amongst the staff. I believed in my motivations for being part of the protest but still had a strong responsibility to the people of the borough and to my colleagues who had given me their trust and whom spent their time working hard to provide services to the people of Wandsworth. I didn't want them to feel I was somehow doing something which would harm the people of the borough. Especially when my motives were to draw attention to the manipulation of local council's by big businesses which so often happens, putting profits in front of community and more and more creating a world in their own image which the rest of us have to live with.

<P>

Things were OK. The ruling conservative councillors (who had been busy selling off parks and graveyards for building on ) were not very happy to say the least. However my bosses felt there was no conflict of interest as it was private land. Many council workers were enjoying seeing the councillors getting wound up and finding the whole thing very amusing. I still had a job to go back to .....

<P>

Things on the site buzzed on. There was a shortage of plywood for the walls of the roundhouse. Early morning trips to local waste disposal sites soon turned up the required wood. Ken and I would set off before the city had woken and use the empty roads to do a round trip taking in a load of skips and three waste sites. Later the roads were a nightmare and trips could take hours. The local DIY superstore proved to have friendly managers and big skips. 

<P>

Unlike the next door building site. The £150,000 to £450,000 flats being built by the river were obviously going to benefit many of the locals! Especially the (not) local developer (offices in the city, investments world-wide), the multinational contractor, the labourers (very few of which turned out to be local) and the local prospective Tory councillor  who would gain some wealthier residents in this generally poor part of the Borough. The site manager refused to let us take the waste wood from the skips, it being much more useful in landfill sites. Fortunately the night watchman was much more reasonable.

<P>

I now had time to work on a home for myself. I had been to the meetings held for people who might want to stay on after the protest finished, I was homeless, though with the security of friends and family to stay with if I needed to. The site was local to my work and my contract had some time to run. I am not fond of cities but as I had planned to be around until my job finished and as I had come to feel a responsibility for the local area through my work I decided I would stay. I found some pine trunks which had come from near Newbury and looked around for other materials, there were a few pallets. Later that day the frame had taken shape. It was to be a small pyramid with two floors. The design was simply the easiest way of using the materials lying around. The bed space upstairs was small and could be insulated easily, the downstairs was big enough to work and live in. Not the greatest flat in London but the rent was cheap and the garden magnificent.

<P>

I was waking early with the first light and watching the river and the wildlife on the site. Foxes came and went, birds sang and butterflies danced. I sat one morning in the compost toilets taking a morning dump with the sunlight filtering through the plastic walls along with distant city noises. It was more than halfway though the week and I was happy with the progress. Still seated I pulled the plastic aside to watch the Butterflies in the Buddlia and found the lens of a video camera and the channel four film crew smiling at me "could you tell us what you are doing now"..... It sort of summed up much of the first week.

<P>

Another thing that stood out was the failure of much of the media to realise that what they were watching was people who were used to living a certain way, co-operatively instead of competitively, spontaneously meeting and organising what to do next based on immediate resources and a desire to communicate and draw from our collective knowledge. I remember one early article which said "the protesters met and organisers read prepared speeches" what actually happened was we met and people stood up and talked as they thought necessary at the time. 

<P>

On the Friday night I left and took a bus to Oxford to draw a plan of the site on a friend's computer. I worked through the night to prepare a plan of how the site could possibly develop in the future with workshops and homes for local people, riverside cafes, a circular bus route and recreational spaces. It was intended to stimulate discussion amongst local people who were invited to an open day on the Saturday. 

<P>

What we had created was a low impact temporary settlement. I thought to create a sustainable, ecological urban development needed a realistic view that only a minority  of people would be content to live for long on the site as it had become. For me the main point was to get people thinking of ways to use this valuable space for the benefit of as many people as possible in ways that demonstrated the accepted ideas for planning sustainable cities: renewable energy generation (we had obtained a small wind generator for the site), public transport favoured over the private car, easy pedestrian and cycle access and buildings that were built as much as possible by those who were to live in them (making them cheaper, creating a sense of community by working together, providing work and cycling as much finance as possible back into the local economy).

<P>

I returned on Saturday lunch time to find a transformation. The wind generator span on the roof of the roundhouse above solar panels, the walls were finished, thin branches formed patterns in the windows and more candle holders made from reclaimed copper pipe spiralled around the central post. Gardens were full of plants and seedlings had already begun to sprout. The irrigation system for the gardens was working. Locals wandered around the site and a party spirit  was building up. That evening was the high point of the occupation for me. The efforts of so many different people had come together and created a truly unique place in the heart of a city.  Bands played late into the night as two hundred people danced inside the roundhouse. 

<P>

All that remained to do on the Sunday was to fit a lock to the small gate which had been chosen as the future entrance and present the keys to the people who had decided to stay on and the local people who had supported the occupation and were to hopefully become part of any future community. Steve and I got on with it finishing minutes before the ceremony. 

<P>

I was apprehensive about the future. I was homeless, living on the site would be insecure and I couldn't really expect to have many valuable belongings. Things had been going missing already, whilst many of the local children found the site fascinating some found it an easy place to nick things from. This had however had the interesting effect of drastically cutting crime and vandalism on the local estates. Worst of all I realised that many of the wonderful people whom I'd lived and worked with through the week would now be going back home. I also had to go back to work.

<P>

A new time was about to start and after the highs of the week and the energy and expectations that had been created it would be hard to hang on to the sense of community which had grown. Already people were arriving who had had no part in creating the space. They were homeless and needed a place to be, they were also unaware of some of the motivations behind the protest. They were joining those of us that wanted to stay, many who were also homeless but had shared experiences together.

<P>

It had always been known that after the protest week the village created would be left to those who wished to live there and would provide a place for the city's homeless. It would also be important to maintain the good relationship with the locals that had been developed. It was a big thing to ask of the residents, after all "the land is ours" so how do you ask someone to respect a place and what do you do when they refuse to do so?       

<P>

Those of us who had decided to stay had drawn up a list of things we felt should be respected by ourselves and new arrivals. Many people didn't want to impose rules and regulations on themselves, I felt and do still feel that boundaries have to be set for communities to live together. They have to deal with how you intend to live around each other and how you will treat the world  you live in. They provide a basis upon which to deal with conflicts that may arise. Maybe one of the problems that our society faces now is that its laws have evolved over long timescales and too much emphasis is now placed on those that focus on restricting individual freedoms and not enough on those that protecting what is there for us all from the interests of more powerful organisations. This has led to a widespread disrespect for all boundaries and a loss of recognition of why they were there in the first place. When governments and companies or their representatives can seemingly do what they wish, changing the rules if they don't suit them why shouldn't an individual?   

<P>

At the end of the second week I left for two days to have a break and think about the future. When  I returned there was a huge difference about the place, so many familiar faces were gone strangers sat around the fire with cans of beer. I felt lost and hurt in some way, as if you had returned home to find your family had undergone a transformation. It was unfair of me to feel this, many of the people there were fine just unknown at the time. It was the change from hundreds of people buzzing with enthusiasm to sixty trying to figure out what to do now that really caused this uncomfortable sensation. 

<P>

There were still about thirty people from the first few weeks and I soon settled down. I worked for two or three days a week and spent the rest of the time working on projects for the site or getting on with the rest of my life. The immediate problems now were the threat of eviction, what to do about the public enquiry into Safeway and Guinness's unpopular plans for the site, how to encourage and present alternative plans for the site and how to continue to create a good place to live amongst all these pressures. The eviction hearings were out of my hands. The advisory service for squatters was dealing with our defence as best it could. 

<P>

I could go and meet with Guinness, which small parties of us did on  three or four occasions. At these meetings I tried my best to communicate to their representatives the potential benefits of adopting a sustainable green development strategy for the site. Imagine one of the largest green developments of any major European capital, making a truly positive contribution to altering the face of our cities. Something politicians and various international bodies assure us is vital for the future.

<P>

Guinness pride themselves as a company on their environmental record. Indeed they have helped many worthwhile causes and support the Guinness housing trust. Their products whilst being mainly legal drugs are less harmful in production than many other industries.  However they suffer from the same, I believe, mistaken viewpoint that afflicts so many multinational companies caught up in their own financial momentum; That by encouraging people to consume more and more of their products and buying up and stamping out smaller competitors fuelling the profits for their shareholders, whilst giving a little to charities, they are somehow helping the world. As opposed to increasing the already unsustainable levels of consumption in the developed world and stopping badly needed finance from cycling in local economies. They didn't want to listen. As one of their directors said to me, typifying the attitudes of big business globally "We abdicated responsibility for the site in 1989 when we turned it over to the developers." To them it represented nothing more than an investment with a better rate of return than a bank.

<P>

I could also help in the presentation of objections to the government inspector at the planning public enquiry. There were already five local groups who objected to the proposals as well as the council planning committee who had already rejected two schemes. A small group of us formed and started to examine the plans. We drew upon the governments planning policy guidance notes (PPG) which are published under code numbers and titles, PPG7 for example deals with development in rural areas. There was also special guidance for Thameside development and the council's own Local plan. 

<P>

It is useless to object to any planning application on the grounds that you don't like it. For an objection to be successful you must prove harm will come from the proposal based upon the guidance given in PPG's and a few other official documents. Planning is a complex and seemingly dull area of bureaucracy and it is no surpass that so many unwelcome schemes get permission when large companies can employ specialists to force them through. Whilst most people objecting will be facing the system for the first time and be lost in a maze of paperwork. I had never been involved firsthand in  any of this stuff, though I had some idea of the process. To be honest it did my head in.  

<P>

Fortunately other people had more experience and provided  guidance. I spent the evenings either in the local pub using the light to read endless dull documents to counter the proposed traffic scheme or at friend's houses typing my proof of evidence. According to Safeway's engineers 700 new carparking spaces were not going to encourage more traffic in the area nor make the already dangerous roads worse. I asked traffic engineer friends for advice and used my own judgement to represent Safeway's  own traffic surveys in a less rosy light. At the same time I helped prepared our own planning application for the site which we finally presented on the day the enquiry opened. I was busy at work and becoming more tired due to the amount I had taken on.

<P>

The enquiry was to last for two weeks. I attended nearly every day with a few other people, except when I had to work. Finally my turn to give evidence came. I read the summary I had prepared and sat waiting to be cross examined by Safeway's lawyer. It was thankfully short, he questioned my qualifications. I wasn't a pure traffic engineer. Fortunately I was sure of the validity of my arguments and managed to give firm answers to his questions. I don't know how worried I looked. Mostly I felt angry that people like him are paid huge amounts by companies to argue for the most harmful of developments whilst the public usually have to rely on volunteers or overworked council officials. The true meaning of "the land is ours" for me is our right to have our voices heard and to be represented on an equal footing to the developers and planning specialists. We are all guardians of our country and its future should not be held in the hands of those who can be bought.

<P>

We produced flyers to encourage local people to come and have their say. Several hundred turned up for the special session which we persuaded the inspector to hold in a local church hall and I got to present a petition against the supermarket plan signed by several thousand more. This was an uplifting evening for me as I had started to doubt if people could be bothered to try and express their views. Most I had talked to didn't know they could influence decisions or were too busy trying to get by, caught up in the struggles of their own lives. Some simply didn't give a shit. Many did however, people I had never seen were there to reject the plans and ask for better schemes to be considered.    

<P>

As I write this I have no idea if we succeeded to block the proposal as the inspector has yet to report. If we did then for me the occupation did something for the people of Wandsworth as well as the first week's protest had done something to highlight the many abuses of our shared land by faceless profit hungry organisations. Our planning application was rejected by the council. 

<P>     

Back on the site many people had little idea what was going on. Some were alienated by the idea of the communal meetings so didn't come. Others were far to drunk to care. Some had other problems of their own. As more of London's homeless found the site or were sent by churches or shelters so the hardships of living there had increased. Most of my friends from the first weeks were trying to get on with building homes and gardens. Many supporters from all over the country came to visit and help during the days. But increasingly I came to feel we were being overwhelmed by the needs of those less able or unwilling to sort themselves out. At night the local drunks would come to hang out, a few folk had serious drug problems, some had mental health problems.... I finally found time to finish my home.

<P>

Basically we were facing the same problems as much of society, more concentrated in the cities and more so on the streets. We had failed to stop people who would not or could not respect the place or themselves from coming in and there were too few with the skills or the energy to confront it. It was obvious by the praise from visitors that this was not so obvious from the outside. Maybe I was simply too sensitive about my home and ideals. There were certainly still lots of good times and on the whole it was amazing how well a large group of strangers were getting on in hard circumstances...                     

Those of us who cared for the site and had invested time in it, including many of the later arrivals, were increasingly tense. The threat of eviction was constantly there and we had no more legal avenues left. The fact was many people now on the site didn't seem to care about this. They had to many problems of their own and being moved on was a normal part of existence. The late night visitors didn't care anyway as it was just another place to hang around when it was gone they could find another.

<P>

For me communicating with the local people and getting them to participate in the future of the site was the only way I had ever seen to take the protest further and to provide any possible security to those who wanted to stay on. I was increasingly finding it frustrating that so many site residents took no interest in welcoming visitors or communicating with the local people. Even so there were still a core of regular visitors from the local estates some of whom worked on improving the site some who used it as a place for recreation. The weekly "open" days usually went well and the arts and music provided much needed energy to those who were struggling behind the scenes to tidy up before the events. 

<P>

For me though it was becoming harder to face both the supporters from off site and those who were working so hard within it. My contract had finished and I had to come to terms with my own needs and desires. On the positive side there had been no eviction despite having lost the court battle. There were new people arriving who wanted to make the place work. There was a diverse community forming on the land. A developer had expressed interest in buying the site for housing and small business. Though I was unsure if he truly appreciated sustainable principles he was at least listening. I had some part time work and could get another contract if I wanted to, though this would be in another part of the city. I had a home I was happy to live in and good friends on the site and elsewhere in the city. 

<P>

On the down side I felt that after the excitement of the protest and the enquiry many local people had increasingly been alienated by the behaviour of some people. There was an increased level of conflict between those who's interests were a little broader than self and those who just wanted a fire and a beer. Occasional fights had broken out between drunks. My home had been broken into by one of the local teenagers and a friend and I had lost some belongings. Losing the stuff was OK but the fact that It was so easy to do and that most of the locals knew those of us living there had very little was upsetting. 

<P>

Mainly I had to recognise that I have a deep dislike for city life and that long-term I had no intention of staying there. This led to me being unwilling to forcefully express my opinions to the other residents who were happy to live within the city. If I was not to be a part of the place whatever the future held then I could only offer advice and accept the decisions of others. Worst of all I could no longer face the supporters and friends who wanted so much for the place and saw the good things that were going on as I was unsure if enough residents were now still aware of the reason the site existed. I had no energy left to confront the selfish elements of our community who were abusing the good will of the local people and all those who had put so much effort into creating the place to start with. Thankfully others did.

<P>

Kate a friend who had helped at the start of the occupation had asked Mike Feingold a top permaculture teacher to visit and hold a two day workshop. This was a great event. There were a fair number of people who had been continuing to practice the techniques of permaculture on the site since the first protest week. Many others who had arrived had little idea of green sustainable lifestyles and had been mainly unwilling (or unable) to listen to those of us who did. Visitors had received as much information as they wanted but I think many of the new residents thought that the people they met when they arrived were just hanging around and  didn't have any worthwhile knowledge to share. Or they felt threatened by anyone who wanted to discuss ways of living with them. Mike, being an "expert" was listened to by more people and it was incredible how talking stopped, faces turned and eyes lit up as he explained how people all over the world have taken wasted land and a long term way of thinking and turned them into an ecological livelihood. The silence followed by gasps that greeted his slides of places transformed not by Governments, developers and big business but by people who worked together for a sustainable green future was for me the perfect communication of the vision so many people had shown during the first week.          

<P>

Several more weeks passed. The stress to all of not knowing if or when we were to be evicted showed. Occasionally tempers frayed.  I withdrew more from active involvement in the social life of the site. I was exhausted and only wanted to spend my time with friends. I was also increasingly unhealthy and run down. Whereas in the past I had enjoyed running around the place helping to build new things now I mainly wanted to be left alone or with friends who bounced back the energy I shared with them. I still couldn't decide if I wanted to stay or leave. I had shared so much with so many wonderful people who were still there and felt unable to leave those I cared for who had given me so much. Finally I left for a break to decide my future plans. I wasn't going to live on the site again. 

<P>

I returned for a few days after two weeks and was glad to see friends getting on with life and to be able to view the site from a different perspective. However for me it was enough, the place felt better than I remembered but I had decided to put my efforts into somewhere that had more chance of being there in ten or a hundred years time where the weight of corporate finance was less likely to march the bailiffs in to further increase their profits.  For me the site had failed to have a collective vision of its future that was strong enough to move towards.                

<P>

Land rights and land use issues command a lot of attention when they occur in other countries. Their effects on the environment are noted and publicised. In the South American rainforests, mining, fossil fuel exploration and the actions of homeless people driven off their land into the forest by huge landowners have long been recognised by large sections of the public in Europe as damaging to the environment. People are horrified to hear of the corruption and manipulation of legal processes which goes on in the name of business and economics. 

<P>

Why then do we allow (often the same) large wealthy organisations to control and manipulate land use in our own countries ? Maybe because the inequities in the distribution of wealth between very rich and poor are less obvious here, there are fewer very poor and there is a welfare system to assist those at the bottom of the pile which blurs the edges of the problem. Maybe because it is hundreds of years since the land here was divided and enclosed. Maybe because we have a system of strong established planning Laws and very few people know or care how they work. Maybe because developments of the scale that we have become accustomed to require the resources and expertise only available in such organisations and we are not offered and, as a society, do not yet want an alternative?   

<P>

The protest gave me a greater insight into the social problems of our and other nations. It also gave me a still greater respect for those who spend their lives dealing with them. However I remain convinced that they are symptoms of the greater problems of greed and over consumption which have developed over centuries.

<P>

The future  must be shaped by us all working towards ways of having satisfying, stimulating lives that respect and maintain the diversity of life on the planet and provide for our needs. This does not necessarily mean having a "job" in the traditional sense, simply to supply the money to buy our desires. A sustainable secure future is one where our education and knowledge of the interactions and processes in nature are enhanced by our skills and technology to provide for our needs and give time for the social interactions which support our sense of self and reduce our insecurities. 

<P>

There is a beautiful  world to share, not to be denied to people because they have to participate in an economic roundabout the proceeds of which are siphoned off to the financial elite before they can even start to buy their bit of it. If the pure genius occupation did nothing else it housed and fed sixty people over four months close to central  London, with no more social problems than are seen on any estate, for a cost of around four thousand pounds. Or, putting it another way, less than £20 a person a month. So when we are told there simply isn't the money to educate our children or develop alternative sustainable cities maybe we will start to question supermarket profits in the hundreds of millions and  developers and financiers speculating with billions of pounds worth of land whilst manipulating the planning system and forcing us all to live with the results?

<I>Les pays donateurs membres du <a href="33cad.htm">Comit&eacute; d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement</a>
subissent des pressions budg&eacute;taires qui compromettent s&eacute;rieusement
l'effort financier inetrantional en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement.
La coop&eacute;ration est pourtant plus que jamais une n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
pour de nombreux pays, surtout en Afrique.</I> 
<HR>
<P>
En 1995, la s&eacute;curit&eacute; de l'humanit&eacute; demeure
encore hors de port&eacute;e. Plus d'un milliard de personnes
vivent dans une extr&ecirc;me pauvret&eacute;. Certes, d'apr&egrave;s
les statistiques de 1994, l'&eacute;cart entre les besoins de
financement et les ressources financi&egrave;res disponibles ne
s'est pas accentu&eacute; : la somme des apports financiers aux
pays en d&eacute;veloppement (PED) atteint le niveau record de
59 milliards de dollars, soit une progression de 3 milliards par
rapport &agrave; 1993. En termes r&eacute;els, toutefois, le montant
total de l'aide publique reste inchang&eacute;. Les contributions
financi&egrave;res r&eacute;elles se sont accrues dans treize
pays membres du Comit&eacute; d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement (Cad),
de l'Organisation de coop&eacute;ration et de d&eacute;veloppement
&eacute;conomiques (OCDE) mais ont diminu&eacute; dans huit autres.
Apr&egrave;s s'&ecirc;tre stabilis&eacute;e, la part de l'aide
publique au d&eacute;veloppement (APD) dans le produit national
brut d&eacute;cro&icirc;t et n'atteint que 0,3 % en 1994. En revanche,
le tassement des programmes bilat&eacute;raux de pr&ecirc;t et
l'augmentation de la part des dons dans l'APD totale est significative.
<P>
<H3>Demandes d'aide</H3>
<P>
Pourtant, poursuivre la politique d'aide est indispensable &agrave;
plusieurs titres. D'une part, l'APD reste vitale pour de nombreux
PED, notamment les plus pauvres d'entre eux, qui ont vu leur situation
se d&eacute;t&eacute;riorer au cours des derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies.
Pour augmenter leurs capacit&eacute;s, il est fondamental qu'ils
investissent dans la formation, la sant&eacute;, la d&eacute;mographie,
la gestion des affaires publiques, le financement des infrastructures,
etc. Or, les investissements du secteur priv&eacute; prennent
principalement le chemin des pays et des secteurs les plus dynamiques
du monde en d&eacute;veloppement, tandis que les dons priv&eacute;s
servent surtout &agrave; r&eacute;pondre &agrave; des besoins
humanitaires imm&eacute;diats. D&eacute;gager des ressources substantielles
pour la coop&eacute;ration s'av&egrave;re donc une priorit&eacute;
pour &eacute;pauler les pays et les peuples qui, comme en Afrique,
op&egrave;rent des transformations en profondeur de leur syst&egrave;me
&eacute;conomique et politique.
<P>
En second lieu, la coop&eacute;ration constitue un v&eacute;ritable
investissement. Des progr&egrave;s incontestables sur le plan
du bien-&ecirc;tre &eacute;conomique et social ont &eacute;t&eacute;
enregistr&eacute;s : plus de deux milliards de personnes ont vu
leur revenu s'accro&icirc;tre, leur esp&eacute;rance de vie s'allonger,
leur &eacute;ducation et leur acc&egrave;s aux services essentiels
s'am&eacute;liorer. L'aide a contribu&eacute; &agrave; jeter les
fondements de la r&eacute;ussite &eacute;conomique de nombreux
pays autrefois pauvres : au cours des trente derni&egrave;res
ann&eacute;es, les taux de croissance les plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s
ont &eacute;t&eacute; enregistr&eacute;s dans le monde en d&eacute;veloppement.
En particulier, certains pays d'Asie et d'Am&eacute;rique latine
ont vu leur niveau de vie s'am&eacute;liorer rapidement gr&acirc;ce
&agrave; l'augmentation des courants d'&eacute;changes et des
apports de capitaux et de technologie. La coop&eacute;ration a
favoris&eacute; l'&eacute;mergence de nouveaux partenaires &eacute;conomiques,
source de dynamisme, qui offrent aux pays du Nord de nouvelles
possibilit&eacute;s d'&eacute;changes, d'investissements et de
cr&eacute;ation d'emplois. Depuis 1990, les d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s
ouverts par les PED aux &Eacute;tats membres de l'OCDE se sont
accrus de 50 %. La coop&eacute;ration pour le d&eacute;veloppement
se r&eacute;v&egrave;le donc un investissement essentiel pour
l'avenir.
<P>
<H3>Restrictions budg&eacute;taires</H3>
<P>
Malheureusement, les d&eacute;cisions budg&eacute;taires prises
r&eacute;cemment dans plusieurs grands pays donateurs ne laissent
gu&egrave;re de place &agrave; l'optimisme. Mais &agrave; d&eacute;faut
d'augmenter le volume de l'APD, les donateurs peuvent accro&icirc;tre
l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide, avec &agrave; la cl&eacute; de
nombreux d&eacute;fis &agrave; relever. Ils commencent d'ailleurs
&agrave; se rendre compte &agrave; quel point le manque de coordination
a entrav&eacute; la r&eacute;ussite des programmes de coop&eacute;ration.
Renforcer la coordination internationale exige en priorit&eacute;
que chaque donateur, gouvernement ou institution, am&eacute;liore
sa propre gestion de l'aide et assure la coh&eacute;rence des
diff&eacute;rents instruments de coop&eacute;ration (humanitaires,
politiques, &eacute;conomiques) dont il dispose.
<P>
Dans son rapport 1995 &#171;Coop&eacute;ration pour le d&eacute;veloppement&#187;,
le Cad montre d'ailleurs que les pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s
comme les PED &eacute;voluent dans leur mani&egrave;re de traiter
les probl&egrave;mes de d&eacute;veloppement. Leur conception
de la croissance &eacute;conomique fait une place beaucoup plus
large au capital humain et social, c'est-&agrave;-dire aux aptitudes
des individus, des groupes et des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s enti&egrave;res
&agrave; apprendre, &agrave; s'adapter et &agrave; coop&eacute;rer.
La communaut&eacute; internationale est en passe de cr&eacute;er
un cadre nouveau pour la coop&eacute;ration. Elle met de plus
en plus l'accent sur la dimension sociale du d&eacute;veloppement
durable et sur l'interd&eacute;pendance croissante des nations
et des peuples. Elle prend conscience que l'int&eacute;gration
dans les &eacute;changes internationaux d&eacute;pend beaucoup
des efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s au plan interne, du sens des
responsabilit&eacute;s des dirigeants et de l'existence d'une
puissante soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile. Il devient essentiel de
poss&eacute;der un syst&egrave;me &eacute;conomique et politique
ouvert. Dans le m&ecirc;me temps s'op&egrave;re une red&eacute;finition
de la notion fondamentale de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, qui repose
d&eacute;sormais davantage sur les besoins et pr&eacute;occupations
de l'&ecirc;tre humain ainsi que sur la qualit&eacute; de l'environnement.
<P>
Le Cad tente de donner corps &agrave; cette vision commune et
d'envisager quelle pourrait &ecirc;tre la structure de la coop&eacute;ration
au si&egrave;cle prochain. Il souligne en particulier que les
strat&eacute;gies de d&eacute;veloppement doivent &ecirc;tre accept&eacute;es
par la population des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et refl&eacute;ter
les priorit&eacute;s de chaque &Eacute;tat. Selon le Comit&eacute;,
&#171;en dernier ressort, ce sont les PED eux-m&ecirc;mes qui
doivent prendre en main leur propre d&eacute;veloppement.&#187;
Or pour le moment, il est difficile de trouver un PED qui ait
mis en place une strat&eacute;gie de d&eacute;veloppement dont
il serait le v&eacute;ritable propri&eacute;taire et qui servirait
en m&ecirc;me temps de cadre pour coordonner les actions des donateurs.
<P>
<H3>Des pistes pour l'avenir</H3>
<P>
En tout &eacute;tat de cause, la coordination doit &ecirc;tre
renforc&eacute;e au niveau national &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
des PED. C'est la raison pour laquelle le Cad a d&eacute;cid&eacute;
de regarder les interventions de l'ensemble des donateurs dans
la perspective du pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, de &#171;retourner
le t&eacute;lescope dans l'autre sens&#187;. Cette m&eacute;thode
de terrain permettra de mieux distinguer quelles sont les interventions
pertinentes.
<P>
La coop&eacute;ration Sud-Sud et les partenariats triangulaires
entre donateurs et PED pourraient &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre
renforc&eacute;s. Plusieurs membres du Cad encouragent d&eacute;j&agrave;
des programmes de ce type : les &Eacute;tats-Unis, le Japon ou
les pays scandinaves financent la formation d'experts d'un PED
dans un autre, sensibilisent de nouveaux donateurs d'aide (Cor&eacute;e
du Sud, Mexique, R&eacute;publique tch&egrave;que et Turquie),
afin qu'ils augmentent et am&eacute;liorent leurs programmes de
coop&eacute;ration.
<P>
La question de la coh&eacute;rence entre les programmes de coop&eacute;ration
et les autres politiques qui concernent les PED se pose depuis
longtemps mais les n&eacute;gociations du cycle d'Uruguay lui
ont donn&eacute; une importance croissante et elle doit &ecirc;tre
au centre des d&eacute;bats internationaux. Dans cette perspective,
le Cad s'attache &agrave; identifier et &agrave; renforcer les
mesures de coop&eacute;ration susceptibles d'am&eacute;liorer
la capacit&eacute; des PED &agrave; s'ins&eacute;rer eux-m&ecirc;mes
dans les circuits &eacute;conomiques internationaux. Le Cad suit
notamment de tr&egrave;s pr&egrave;s les n&eacute;gociations en
cours en vue de la mise en place d'un accord multilat&eacute;ral
sur l'investissement, qui sera &eacute;galement ouvert aux pays
non membres de l'OCDE. La coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale,
qui n'en est qu'&agrave; ses d&eacute;buts, est un autre chantier
tr&egrave;s important pour l'avenir. Des initiatives int&eacute;ressantes
existent en Am&eacute;rique latine avec le March&eacute; commun
du C&ocirc;ne Sud (Mercosur) ou en Indochine avec la Commission
du M&eacute;kong, qui rassemble les pays riverains du fleuve.
<P>
Les programmes t&eacute;l&eacute;vis&eacute;s ou les grands titres
des journaux demeurent souvent pessimistes et parfois alarmistes
sur le futur de certains PED. Ils n'ont peut-&ecirc;tre pas compl&egrave;tement
tort, mais ne traduisent qu'un aspect de la r&eacute;alit&eacute;
: ils occultent d'autres tendances dont un bon nombre, malgr&eacute;
les incertitudes, sont encourageantes. Les sch&eacute;mas traditionnels
de coop&eacute;ration pour le d&eacute;veloppement sont en train
d'&eacute;voluer et leurs chances de succ&egrave;s s'am&eacute;liorent.

<P>

<B>1. SADC/EU SIGN NEW REGIONAL INDICATIVE PROGRAMME FOR SOUTHERN

AFRICA </B>

<P>

 Stefan Smidt, European Commission Director-General for Development

and Kaire Mbuende, Executive Secretary of the South African Development

community, SADC, signed a Regional Indicative Programme worth

121 ECU last Tuesday in Windhoek at the EU SADC ministerial conference.

The Programme seeks to promote the development of infrastructures

and services, trade, investment and finance and promotion of intra-regional

exchanges of information and macroeconomics issues. An annex to

the Programme providing additional funds from the European Investment

Bank, EIB, for regional investment projects in the areas of energy,

water supply, telecommunication, transport, industrial development

and the strengthening of the private sector was also signed by

Mr Mbuende and EIB Financing Director Louis Biancarelli. 

<P>

 Dick Spring, the Irish Foreign Minister and EU Council President

described the SADC region as, &quot;one of the top ten most important

markets of the future&quot; adding, &quot;the region has the potential

to make an important contribution to the development of Africa

as a whole&quot;.

<P>

<B>2. EU ENVOY EXPRESSES HOPE FOR RWANDAN REFUGEES</B>

<P>

 Mr. Aldo Ajello, the EU's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region

voiced his hope that positive results would emerge from the new

approach set out in Geneva last week by the UN High Commissioner

for Refugees and countries assisting the 16 million Rwandan refugees

in Zaire and Tanzania. Mr Ajello who is currently on tour in the

Great Lakes Region stated that the action plan could only be successful

if there is co-operation between the international community and

interested countries, especially those directly concerned. He

added &quot;the human, financial and political cost is no longer

bearable&quot;. 

<P>

<B>3. EU THROWS ITS WEIGHT BEHIND EAST AFRICAN SUMMIT ON PEACE

IN BURUNDI</B>

<P>

 The European Union has pledged that it will do all it can to

move the peace process forward in Burundi as the leaders of Ethiopia,

Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire prepared for a summit

on Burundi on 12 October in Tanzania. The region's leaders are

considering whether the sanctions they imposed on Burundi after

the military coup this year should be extended or eased.

<P>

 The EU main contribution so far has been in backing Central and

East African nation politically and providing humanitarian and

financial to the countries in the region. Since 1995 the EU has

pledged 5.5 million ECU for health programmes, 2.4 million ECU

for the country's treasury, 700 000 ECU for human rights and democracy.<B>

</B>The EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner has also appealed to

European lawyers to help restore Burundi's judicial system after

appeals from the Bujumbura government, but so far no European

lawyers have gone to the region. 

<P>

 Current EU proposals stop just short of sending personnel to

the region. Last month at a meeting with Tanzanian ex-president

Julius Nyerere, the UN-appointed mediator for the region, Dick

Spring, President of the EU Council of Ministers ruled out the

possibility of sending EU peacekeepers to Burundi. He stated that

there was no military solution to the problem. The Commission's

own office in Bujumbura is only manned by secretaries as the delegates

wait in Europe for security conditions to improve. 

<P>

<B>4. EU PRESIDENCY STOPS SHORT OF PRAISING POLITICAL REFORMS

 IN GAMBIA</B>

<P>

 The Irish Presidency of the EU on 15 October published a declaration

on the political reforms in Gambia. The Union welcomed the peaceful

passing of  presidential elections and congratulated the Provisional

Independent Electoral Commission (PIEC) for its role in the elections.

It however, voiced its regret &quot;that recommendations drawn

by the PIEC ignored and that conditions which would have ensured

free and fair elections were not met.&quot; 

<P>

 The Declaration called on the Gambian authorities to &quot;take

all necessary measures so that parliamentary elections due on

11 December 1996 meet the guidelines established by PIEC.&quot;

<P>

<B>5. EU CONTEMPLATES FURTHER SANCTIONS AGAINST BURMA UNDER CFSP</B>

<P>

 The EU Council President and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring

told the Irish Parliament last week that the European Union is

considering imposing further sanctions on Burma after the Burmese

government's lack of response to the EU's legitimate concerns.

 Mr Spring said that the issue had been raised by the Common Foreign

and Security Policy, CFSP, working group and the Commission was

considering the suspension of trade benefits Burma enjoys under

the Generalized System of Preferences. This comes after Mr. Spring's

meeting with Burma Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw in parallel with

the UN General Assembly on 26 September. Mr. Spring added that

the EU has also asked a special UN working group on arbitrary

detention and imprisonment to be allowed into Burma to investigate

circumstances surrounding the death of Danish Consul, Mr. Nichols

and for the UN Commissioner for Human Rights to take action on

the situation in Burma. 

<P>

<B> </B>The situation in Burma will be discussed on 22 and 23

October at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. 

<P>

<B>6. EU HUMANITARIAN OFFICE SHORTLISTS 18 TV AND RADIO REPORTS

FOR ITS AWARDS</B>

<P>

 The Selection Committee of TV and Radio Awards of the European

Community's Humanitarian Office shortlisted 18 TV and radio reports

for rewards. The ECHO awards are given to best reports on humanitarian

subjects. Emma Bonino, the European Commissioner explaining the

practice stated, &quot;with daily reports of humanitarian crises,

and concern about the loss of Iraq and Burma, to name but three

- a 'victim' can appear as just another face, another statistic.

Documentary reporting brings these statistics and faces to life,

making their fears and concerns real (...) This is why the ECHO

awards were created, to recognise the vital role that is played

by broadcasters in bringing to the public awareness issues and

situations which would otherwise go largely ignored.&quot; 

<P>

 A judging panel will meet in Brussels on 7 November  to choose

the winners who will be presented with their awards on 9 December

in the presence of  Emma Bonino and Irish President Mary Robins.

<P>

<B>7. ATD/FOURTH WORLD PRESENT REPORT ON POVERTY ON WORLD ANTI-POVERTY

DAY&quot; IN BRUSSELS</B>

<P>

 Last Thursday, 17 October,  ATD/Fourth World presented the General

Report on Poverty at a procession titled World Anti Poverty Day.

The Report was drawn up at the request of the Belgian government

and published at the beginning of the year. The ATD, who sponsored

the procession,  recalled the message its founder, Father J. Wresinski,

gave before 100 000 persons demonstrating for human rights in

Paris in 1987: Slavery has been abolished. Poverty can be abolished

also.&quot; The United Nations has proclaimed 1996 the &quot;International

Year for the Abolition of Poverty&quot;

<B>1 <I>EUROSTEP</I> FISHERIES CAMPAIGN GOES PUBLIC</B> 

<P>

<I>Eurostep</I> will stage a public event in front of the European

Council offices in Brussels on Tuesday 28 May the day of the meeting

of the Development Council. The purpose is to raise awareness

of the fisheries issue and of the <I>Eurostep</I> campaign. The

delegation, which includes three representatives of the fishing

community in Senegal, will present a report to the Chairman of

the Development Council. The report &quot;The Fight for Fish:

Towards Fair Fisheries Agreements&quot; has been produced by NOVIB

and is now available in both English and French. After a one hour

demonstration on the street the party will move off to the <I>Eurostep</I>

office for a press conference.

<P>

Over the following two days the delegation will have a packed

schedule of engagements which includes an address to the Development

Committee of the European Parliament, and high level meetings

at both DG VIII and DG XIV.

<P>

<B>2 THE FUTURE OF THE LOME CONVENTION</B> 

<P>

The working group on the negotiations for the future of Lom&eacute;

beyond the year 2000 is meeting in the <I>Eurostep</I> office

today. Meanwhile, the Commissioner for relations with ACP countries

and South Africa Mr. Joao de Deus Pinheiro has been dropping hints

about the current thought processes within the Commission. At

a press conference on 21 May Mr. Pinheiro gave the results of

a public opinion survey on how Europeans perceive developing countries.

The survey - called the Eurobarometer - shows that the place of

development cooperation in the list of priorities of European

people has fallen since the last survey in 1991 (it is now in

tenth place). However, the good news for Mr. Pinheiro is that

the public do seem to believe that the EU is a particularly appropriate

institution to work in this domain. The public ranked development

cooperation fourth in their list of privileged fields of action

for the EU. The three areas felt even more appropriate for a European

level response were relations with the countries of Central and

Eastern Europe, the fight against unemployment, and defense policy.

<P>

As for the thought processes leading up to the end of Lom&eacute;

IV, Mr. Pinheiro confirmed that the reflection group which has

been established in the Commission will be producing a green paper

by the end of October. However &quot;the green paper will not

be a book of answers but a book of questions&quot; he said and

he gave examples of the question which were being asked -

<UL>

<LI>What will be the impact of the private sector in development?

<LI>Will the same cooperation instruments be applied to all countries

and to all geographical areas?

<LI>Should one separate the Caribbean and the Pacific from Sub-Saharan

Africa?

</UL>



<P>

Following presentation of the green paper the Commission will

work towards adopting a formal communication in 1997. The actual

negotiations for the new convention will begin in 1998.

<P>

<B>3 GREAT LAKES DEVELOPMENT MEETING</B> 

<P>

The United Nations Non-Governmental liaison service in Geneva

reports in its magazine <I>GO Between</I> that there will be a

governmental level conference in Kinshasa on June 10 to 14 to

discuss development projects for the Great Lakes region. NGOs

are welcome to attend the proceedings, as are regional

<P>

cooperation institutions, the private sector, and investors. The

conference will bring together the governments of Burundi, Rwanda,

Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire.

<P>

We do not have any further information to give you except that

the official UN contact for the conference is the Multinational

Programming and Operational Centre of the United Nations Economic

Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, telephone + 251 1 515 827,

fax + 251 1 515 907.

<P>

<B>4 HABITAT II</B> 

<P>

The United Nations Conference on Human Settlements - otherwise

known as Habitat II - will be taking place in the first two weeks

of June in Istanbul. The Women's Environment and Development Organisation

(WEDO) based in New York has formed a women's caucus to focus

efforts to influence the discussions at the conference. The caucus

has been lobbying the conference preparatory process in order

to influence the agenda and is offering facilities at Habitat

II itself including daily de-briefings and a special &quot;super-coalition

tent&quot; for 500 people to be a home from home for the conference's

women. They will give an orientation to the women's caucasus process

at the outset of the conference on Sunday 2 June at the NGO forum

in Istanbul. You can contact them in New York - telephone + 1

212 759 7982 or fax + 1 212 759 8647

<P>

<B>5 Health</B> 

<P>

Following on from last week's alternative PAF, we are glad to

say that the health of Peter Bastogi continues to improve. He

is now able to breathe without the help of a respirator and is

left with a much reduced infection. This is good news. <HR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. EU HUMANITARIAN AID FOR REFUGEES IN FORMER

YUGOSLAVIA<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission's Humanitarian Office, ECHO,

has approved a humanitarian aid package worth 85 million ECU for

refugees, displaced persons and vulnerable groups in the former

Yugoslavia (Bosnia, Croatia, Federal Yuigoslav Republic). The

programme which is primarily made up of food, hygiene supplies,

shelter and psycho-social assistance for the most vulnerable people

is to be implemented by NGOs, UN specialised agencies as well

as the Commission. The Commission will also assist in the reconstruction

of housing and basic social infrastructures in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

This is in order to encourage refugees and displaced persons to

return to original homes.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>According to the Commission almost one million people

are still displaced within Bosnia-Herzegovina while a million

others are refugees outside the country. The figure in Croatia

is 350 000. The ECHO programme in collaboration with the United

Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slovenia will focus

on the needs of the peoples of Eastern Slovenia. Within the Federal

Yugoslavia aid will go to the estimated 500 000 Croatian and Bosnian

refugees. <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. COMMISSION ADOPTS GREEN PAPER ON FUTURE OF

ACP/EU RELATIONS<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission last week adopted its &quot;Green

Paper&quot; on the reassessment of EC/ACP relations. The Commission

deems it necessary to encourage wide debate on the relationship,

as the Lom&eacute; 1V Convention - the main framework of co-operation

between the two groups, nears its end in the year 2000.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The Paper raises the following pertinent issues -

a) whether the present vast diverse ACP grouping of states should

be maintained, giving that the grouping is neither an economic,

political or geographical entity; b) improving competitiveness

and reinforcement of the private sector; c) the role and workings

of the State; d) how the current system of trade preferences to

improve the ACP States ability to profit from the system. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The underlying points running throughout the Paper

are i. the need for greater efficacy or in other words a results

based approach to co-operation; ii. a greater role for the civil

society and the creation of 'investment friendly' environment;

iii. the differentiation of response to the different needs of

the ACP States receiving aid. This implies more flexible aid instruments

and 'positive discrimination' for the least developed countries.</FONT>

<P>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>In line with its reorganisation and rationalisation

of management, the European Commission has reshuffled a number

of its senior officials and made a few new appointments in top

positions. Steffen Smidt the former Director General of Development

becomes Director General of Personnel replacing the retiring Frans

de Koster and Director General for Information and Culture, Collette

Flesh, becomes Director General of the Translation Service. Michel

vanden Abeele the former head of Commissioner Karel van Miert's

cabinet replaces Heinrich von Moltke as Director General for Business

and Tourism Policy who resigned after a series of fraud allegations

in his department.<B> </B>The former Spanish representation to

COUNTRIES <BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>A delegation of Swiss Members of Parliament met with

Renato Ruggiero, Director General of the World Trade Organisation,

WTO, on Monday 2 December, to present an open letter expressing

their wish that the WTO makes the marginalisation of poor countries

the top priority at the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference

from 9-13 December. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The letter calls for the halving of all trade barriers

facing the least developed countries by the year 2000. The MPs

also say that the participation of NGOs is important in providing

broad support for the WTO and call for further steps to be taken

to allow NGOs to participate more fully in the WTO's work. The

Parliamentarians' letter, in addition, calls for the creation

of a WTO parliament composed of individual members from the parliaments

of WTO member countries.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Finally the MP's emphasise the need for evidence

that WTO trade regulations are of benefit to all and have no adverse

effects on poorer countries and the environment. They argue that

if the rich countries are the prime beneficiaries of WTO trade

regulations resulting in an increase in global disparities in

wealth, the legitimacy of the work of the WTO will be undermined.

<hr>

<B>Introduction</B>

<P>


In the light of the profound changes which have taken


place since 1989 in the developing countries, Europe and Denmark,


the Government decided in 1993 to prepare a new strategy for the


Danish development policy towards the year 2000. 'Me result of


this work is an extensive strategy paper which was presented to


the Folketing (The Danish Parliament) on March 22, 1994. A translation


of the executive <U>summary</U> of this paper is presented below.


<P>


The problems facing the developing countries and


the instability of international relations increased throughout


the 1980s and the early 1990s. At present, the poorest developing


countries have not overcome the econon3ic crisis of the early


1980s, which requires reform and structural change of state controlled


economies and autocratic political systems. For Sub-Saharan Africa


the 1980s were, in most aspects, a lost decade.


<P>


At the same time, the end of the Cold War fundamentally


changed the rules of the game for international co-operation.


The emergence of economically, ethnically and politically unstable


new states has given rise to increased local and regional tensions


- in several cases with far reaching international consequences.


<P>


In addition, considerable economic growth in a number


of developing countries in East Asia along with improved prospects


for countries in South Asia and Latin America have shown that


the course of development can be changed and that it is possible


to break the vicious circle of poverty.


<P>


For the industralized countries these developments


erect new demands for engagement, cooperation and development


assistance. As a growing number of local problems become regional


and global in character, there is an increasing need to face the


challenges - and to face them in partnership with developing countries


and the newly emerged states. Poverty, the environment, population


pressures, migration and local conflicts all stress the importance


of international solidarity and closer international co-operation.


We do have a responsibility to engage in changing the course of


development, not least in Africa, with the aim of turning the


1990s into the decade where the foundation for economic growth


and social equality was established.


<P>


Denmark has, as a small country, a vital interest


in sustaining international co-operation. A social and humanitarian


tradition has given us the experience that enable us to face these


international challenges. Through our membership of the UN, the


European Union and as a Nordic country, we have a strong basis


for a constructive and effective effort.


<P>


Denmark has a long tradition with international development


co-operation. Our experience has shown how difficult it is to


find sustainable solutions to complicated and often deeply rooted


problems of development. In certain instances, development efforts


have let to tangible results. Other efforts, however, never worked


as expected. The quality requirements to our development assistance


are ever growing, and greater efforts are being made to ensure


that the funds of the Danish development assistance are not misused


or diluted into large bureaucracies. We have a commitment to help


the poorest, and we must, for this reason, be certain that the


assistance we give, actually reaches the most vulnerable groups


of the population.


<P>


One precondition for the ability of Danish development


assistance to comply with these high standards is the continuous


adjustment of our policies in accordance with ongoing changes,


both in the countries we are co-operating with, and inside Denmark


herself. Development co-operation can not be static, but must


adapt to the ever changing environment.


<P>


In recent years, we have learned, for one thing,


the lesson that development co-operation must be looked upon in


a broader, foreign policy perspective involving our overall relations


with developing countries. This applies particulary to the questions


of human rights and democracy, women in development, the environment,


trade policies, debt etc.


<P>


During the 1986-88 period, the first strategic planning


process for Danish development assistance was undertaken. The


result of this process was an Action Programme which in 1989 served


as input to a debate in the Folketing from which decisions regarding


future directions of the development assistance were established.


These recommendations have since then, supplemented with subsequent


parliamentary decisions, guided Denmark's development policy.


<P>


The present strategy is written in line with the


main recommendations of 1989 Plan of Action. 'This means, that


the overall objectives of the Danish development assistance will


be maintained in the future. Especially, the principle of an overall


volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) at one percent


of the Gross National Product persists including an approximately


even distribution between bilateral and multilateral assistance.


<P>


Within this framework the strategy provides a new


orientation and a revised set of guidelines for a dynamic Danish


development policy towards the year 2000.


<P>


The intention of the strategy is not to give an overall


exposition of every aspect of Danish development co-operation.


Instead, the strategy highlights the relevant aspects of the developments


from recent years, which are also expected to be central for our


development policy in the years to come.


<P>


During 1993, two special working groups dealt with


the Danida co-operation with Danish non-government organizations


and with Danish enterprises. The results of this work have been


incorporated into the present strategy.


<P>


Interest in, knowledge of, and collaboration with


developing countries are deeply rooted in the Danish society.


There is, therefore, a strong commitment in the society to development


co-operation. This, in itself, is an important prerequisite for


a Danish development assistance of the highest quality. During


the working process of this strategy, we have drawn on this engagement


and incorporated the knowledge and experience of various interest


groups. Having this in mind, I would like to take this opportunity


to thank the long list of people who contributed - in an essential


and most valuable manner - to the process that has culminated


with this strategy.

<P>


Minister for Development Co-operation


<P>


<hr><p><B>1. Background</B>


<P>


Very much has changed in the world over the last


five to six years. Major political balances have shifted, power


blocks have been dissolved and new states have emerged. New growth


centers have developed, trading agreements have been reached and


regional integration processes are increasingly gaining momentum.


<P>


A lot, however, remains the same. Poverty and underdevelopment


still affects large parts of the world and every fifth person


on earth live in absolute poverty. Despite this, there are positive


tendencies in most developing countries. But unless concerted


efforts are made to initiate comprehensive reforms and maintain


a significant level of development assistance, the development


towards the year 2000 indicates a worsening of the situation in


Sub-Saharan Africa.


<P>


Poverty is behind some of the most fundamental problems


of all developing countries in the years ahead. This applies to


well-known problems such as widespread social deprivation, persisting


population growth, environmental degradation at the local, regional


and global level as well as wars and conflicts. It also applies


to more recent problems such as the growth in migration both locally


and globally, increasing ethnic intolerance and fundamentalism,


and the spread of AIDS to large parts of the population in some


of the poorest countries.


<P>


As a small country, Denmark has a vital interest


in expanding international co-operation. A social and humanitarian


tradition has learned us the experience necessary to face these


international challenges. Through our membership of the UN, the


European Union and as a Nordic country, we have a strong basis


for a constructive and effective effort.


<P>


It is against this background that the &quot;Strategy


for Danish Development Policy Towards the Year 2000&quot; has


been drawn up.


<P>


<B>2.</B> <B>The Strategy's Main


Points</B>


<P>


<B>2.1</B> <B>Development Assistance


Policy towards the year 2000</B>


<P>


In recent years a growing recognition of the inverse


relations between some of the problems involved in international


development co-operation has emerged.


<P>


In many developing countries poverty problems, environmental


degradation, over-utihzation of natural resources, poor health


conditions and high population growth rates in combination produce


a negative dynamic. Lack of economic growth in the poorest, mostly


African, countries has weakened the opportunities for sustainable


improvements in the living conditions among the poorest. At the


same time, failure to integrate these groups into the development


process has, in itself, curbed development and economic growth.


A weak administrative capacity, characterized by inadequate and


incompetent leadership, corruption, ethnic conflicts and religious


intolerance, contibute to accentuating the problems.


<P>


In this situation the overall development policy


has to include a variety of instruments. These will range from


political dialogue on democratization and human rights, over well-targeted


assistance progranmes in key sectors, to special programmes aimed


at strengthening the collaboration between organizations and companies


in Denmark and in the developing countries.


<P>


The primary scope of this strategy is to translate


the overall objectives of Denmark's foreign policy and development


co-operation programme into a progressive and cohesive Danish


development policy based on mutually reinforcing components.


<P>


The strategy is conceived with due attention to the


problems of the developing countries and it attempts to identify


areas which are matching, in which Denmark possesses the preconditions


for, and interest in, a qualified effort.


<P>


The strategy is based on five basic principles:


<ol>


<li>Danish development policy encompasses all our


relations with developing countries, economic and political as


well as multilateral and bilateral. The official development assistance


is a central instrument in the development policy.


<P>


<li>The development policy is flexible and must continuously


be adjusted <B>to </B>new international challenges. The ability


to react quickly and coherently to new situations and react effectively


with emergency relief and other efforts is an integral element


of the development policy.


<P>


<li>Danish development co-operation is rooted in the


commitment to combat the poverty affecting large groups of the


population in many developing countries. 'This is done by providing


official development assistance aimed at developing socially balanced


and ecologically sustainable economic growth.


<P>


<li>Danish development assistance is directed towards


the needs of the developing countries. The priorities and conditions


for Denmark's development policy are reflected in the choice of


co-operation countries, organizations and sectors. Furthermore,


they are reflected in the dialogue with the recipient countries


holding responsibility for specific development activities.


<P>


<li>Development co-operation affects large parts of


the society - both in Denmark and in the recipient countries.


Voluntary and professional organizations, business and industry,


research institutions and public sector institutions comprise


a resource base, that makes qualified diversified Danish assistance


efforts possible. Non-governental actors therefore, must be actively


involved in the formulation, organization and implementation of


Danish assistance efforts.


</ol><P>


<B>2.2</B> <B>The General Perspective


of the Strategy</B>


<P>


Danish development policy is an integral part of


Danish foreign policy, in which the main objectives are: promotion


of common security, the promotion of democratic government and


human rights, the creation of economic and social development


and ensuring ecologically sustainable development The following


objectives have been laid down for Denmark's official development


assistance:


<P>


&quot;The objective of Denmark's official development


assistance to developing countries is through co-operation with


governments and public authorities in these countries to assist


endeavours aimed at achieving economic growth, thereby contributing


to ensuring social progress and political independence, in accordance


with the aims and principles of the United


<P>


Nations Charter and, in addition, through cultural


co-operation to promote "mutual understanding and solidarity."

<P>


Against this background, the overall perspective


of the Strategy for Danish Development Policy Towards the Year


2000 will be to assist developing countries in their efforts to


achieve sustainable development based on the improvement in living


conditions through socially balanced economic growth and with


respect for political independence. Equal and free opportunities


for the individual, in accordance with the aims and principles


of the United Nations Charter, and, in addition, to promote mutual


understanding and solidarity through cultural co-operation.


<P>


The efforts of Danish development assistance will


be organized to promote:


<ul>


<li>production, a socially balanced economic growth


and social justice;


<li>the development of human resources;


<li>pluralistic civil societies and respect for the


individual;


<li>the protection of the global environment and sustainable


exploitation of natural resources;


<li>global and regional co-operation, as well as


<li>cultural co-operation and understanding between


peoples.</ul>


<P>


Fulfillment of these goals will be conditional on


development activities showing due consideration to the respective


contributions of both women and men, together with the utilization


of development assistance in a mutual relationship between bilateral


and multilateral efforts.


<P>


<B>2.3.</B> <B>Poverty Orientation</B>


<P>


Poverty orientation constitutes a fundamental principle


for Danish development assistance.


<P>


The poverty alleviation strategy for Danish official


development assistance may be condensed into three main points:


<ul>


<li>the promotion of sustainable and socially balanced


economic growth;


<li>the development of the social sector, including


the promotion of education and health services as prerequisites


to the development of human resources;


<li>promoting Popular Participation in the development


process, the development of a society based on the rule of law


and good governance as prerequisites to stability and economic,


social and political progress.


</ul><P>


In the weakest countries, the problem of poverty


can only be resolved if the efforts of individual countries are


supported by official development assistance from a range of donor


countries. Denmark will Participate in and contribute to this


co-operation, and will, at the same time, continue its efforts


aimed at increasing the overall volume of official development


assistance of other industrialized countries in accordance with


the established UN targets.


<P>


The implementation of the general poverty alleviation


strategy in the Programme countries will be an integral component


of the formulation of country strategies and will appear explicitly


in these.


<P>


The formulation of specific poverty strategies will


be based on the preconditions prevailing in the individual recipient


country, thus varying from country to country.


<P>


<B>2.4. Cross-cutting themes</B>


<P>


A number of cross-cutting themes will be pursued at all levels within the assistance programme. In addition to


poverty alleviation three such themes have been identified: The


role Of women in development, environment and Promotion Of good


governance and human rights. is that they constitute aspects of


assistance common to all these areas while at the same time act as independent development


assistance areas.


<P>


In most developing countries, women play a critical


role in development. Not only as producers but also as bearers


Of social responsibility and bringing up the next generation.


Danish development assistance emphasizes <B>strengthening of the


role of </B>women in <B>the development process </B>In spite of


concerted efforts over many years, aimed at improving the situation


of women in developing countries, the results are few and scattered.


The global picture continues to show major differences in men's


and women's opportunities and living conditions within almost


all sectors.


<P>


In connection with specific development assistance


efforts, gender aspects will be analyzed. At the same time plans


and goals will be formulated with a view to improving the situation


of women in developing countries and promoting their involvement


in the development process.


<P>


At the operational level emphasis will be placed


on identifying specific goals for women's involvement in the development


process. In the preparation of policy papers, check lists and


other simple aids, steps will be taken to assure full integration


of women's interests throughout the project-cycle.


<P>


In relation to the environment, work will be carried


out at local, national, regional and global levels. To promote


sustainable development in the Danish programme countries, Denmark


will intensify efforts to incorporate the recommendations of the


Rio-conference (UNCED) into Danish development policy. In addition,


Denmark will ensure that environmental aspects are fully incorporated


into Denmark's poverty oriented development assistance.


<P>


Environment Impact Assessments will be undertaken


in all relevant development activities and institutions promoting


sustainable use of natural resources.


<p>

At the same time, Denmark will contribute to strengthening environmental protection and collaboration at regional


and global levels, i.e. by


<UL>


<li>creating incentives for individual developing countries


to engage in the formulation and implementation of regional and


global environmental agreements and programmes;


<li>committing financial and professional assistance


to regional environmental institutions, and


<li>implementing technical environmental studies and


pilot projects in programme countries.</ul>


<P>


The promotion of <B>democratization and human rights


</B>constitutes the last cross-cutting theme. The improvement


of human rights based on respect for <B>the </B>individual is


a goal in itself. It contributes - together with popular participation


in the decision-making processes - to the development of a stable


society.


<P>


Practical assistance to specific human rights and


good governance activities in developing countries will be supported


at all levels. Particular emphasis will be placed on creating


positive incentives for development <B>towards </B>democratic


government and respect for human rights.


<P>


A close and open dialogue with recipient countries


on economic, social, professional and political questions is an


integral part of Danish development co-operation.


<P>


This dialogue will also include questions on the


advancement of human rights and popular participation in the development


process. Continued violation of human rights and lack of interest


within the programme countries to enter into a dialogue on these


issues will be reflected in the extent and character of Danish


development assistance.


<P>


<B>2.5</B> <B>Bilateral Assistance</B>


<P>


The strategy provides for a further concentration


of Danish bilateral assistance efforts.


<P>


Danish development assistance will be concentrating


on fewer countries, and at the country level, on fewer sectors.


<P>


Bilateral development co-operation will concentrate


on activities in 20 programme countries. In connection with the


phasing in and out of programme countries, however, bilateral


co-operation may be extended to a total of 25 countries.


<p>

Due to Denmark's limited human and financial


resources, both bilateral and multilateral assistance will be


utilized selectively and in areas where Denmark has good prerequisites


to contribute.


<p>

Assistance to programme countries can, based


on the individual country's particular circumstances, embrace


all sectors and types of assistance.

<P>


A country strategy will be drawn up for each programme


country. This strategy will be updated on a regular basis.


<P>


Traditional project assistance will, to the widest


possible extent, be <B>concentrated </B>within selected sectors


or sub-sectors. The financial and human resource investments required


to conduct a qualified dialogue with recipient countries make


it essential that our efforts in individual programme countries


are concentrated in a <B>limited number of sectors.</B>


<P>


<B>Collaboration sectors </B>will in individual


countries be selected in accordance with the needs of the recipient


country. Within <B>this </B>framework emphasis will be placed


on areas where the Danish resource base has a strong basis for


supporting and implementing <B>the </B>assistance efforts.


<P>


Assistance within a sector will, to the extent


possible, take the form of <B>sector programme assistance, </B>which


will include broadly based assistance to activities within a given


sector or sub-sector. For example, education and training, running


costs, maintenance and new investment, as well as in the form


of budget assistance.


<P>


At the same time, a portion of Danish governmental


development assistance will continue to be contributed as <B>programme


assistance </B>in the future. This is done to support the implementation


of balanced structural adjustment programmes and to promote economic


growth in countries committed to the implementation of necessary


adjustments. A comparatively large portion of programme assistance


will, within a few years, be contributed in the form of <B>debt


relief.</B>


<P>


Besides activities to promote democratization and


human rights, it will be possible, to a limited extent, to continue


the implementation of innovative <B>projects, </B>outside predetermined


sectors. These projects must be of limited duration and be capable


of establishing a model for similar bilateral activities.


<P>


To ensure sustainability of individual development


activities, assistance will be arranged taking account of <B>the


</B>broad sectoral perspective and in <B>committed co-operation


</B>with the recipient country, which will take overall responsibility


for the <B>activities implemented.</B>


<P>


The changed emphasis of Danish development assistance


efforts implies increased assistance to <B>capacity building </B>in


institutions in recipient countries responsible for sectoral planning,


administration, budget and auditing.


<P>


Increased emphasis on capacity building and increased


local responsibility will be followed up by the gradual reorientation


of <B>personnel assistance. </B>To improve sustainability increased


emphasis will be placed on local advisers supported by short-term


consultants.


<P>


As part of <B>the </B>country strategy process


special efforts will be made to expose areas, where <B>Danish


advisers </B>can participate to promote improved utilization of


local resources in the planning and implementation stages of development


assistance projects.


<P>


Overall, efforts will be made to concentrate bilateral


assistance in the following assistance forms:


<ul>


<li><B>General Programme Assistance, </B>in


the form of balance of payments assistance, in kind assistance,


debt relief, and the like, to support broader socioeconomic reforms.


<li><B>Sector Programme Assistance, to </B>support


developments and reforms within a limited number of sectors or


sub-sectors, for example, within the health service.


<li><B>Project Assistance, </B>which


in the case of pro e co-operation countries will be limited to


minor projects, that are obviously newly created and can act as a model for


similar activities. In addition, projects which, in all developing


countries, can render assistance to the promotion of the democratization


process and human rights. Added to this is the Danish Associated


Financing scheme.


<li><B>Personnel Assistance, </B>is to be reorganized with greater utilization of local advisers and


the short-term deployment of Danish consultants.


<li>Sector programme assistance, assistance towards running


costs, more local responsibility and increased utilization of


local advisers will imply changed conditions for the achievement


of <B>immediate and visible results </B>of assistance, and for


the direct control with local use of Danish funds. A possible


short-term decline in effectiveness and visible results must be


expected to be counterbalanced by development activities becoming


more sustainable with the improved local anchoring. Therefore


they will become more effective, in the final analysis, compared


to projects implemented by posted experts who cannot achieve the


same level of local anchorage.</ul>


<P>


Recipient countries' increased responsibility and


involvement in the preparation and implementation of development


assistance will be followed up by reinforced efforts to <B>strengthen


institutions </B>in recipient countries, responsible for budgeting,


accounts and expenditure control. This strengthening of local control and auditing will be balanced by a reduction


in the direct control of Danish officials on Danish financed activities.


<P>


To strengthen the <B>administration and control


</B>of development assistance, top Priority will be given to assisting


central administrations and local authorities in recipient countries.


For example in the form of institution building, support to increasing


administrative and organisational efficiency as well as strengthening


<B>of </B>auditing and control organs.


<P>


At the same time access to <B>inspection and auditing


</B>of Danish supported programmes will be maintained. This will


also signify to authorities in recipient countries that abuse


of Danish development assistance resources will result in consequences


for the future of development assistance co-operation.


<P>


Besides Programme co-operation countries, bilateral


assistance will be confined to special areas: assistance <B>to


</B>Promote democratization and human rights, associated financing


and transitional assistance. Bilateral assistance will also be


awarded under the terms of the new Special International Environmental


and Catastrophe Facility.


<P>


Assistance to Promote <B>democratization and human


rights </B>will be awarded to a broader selection of developing


countries in accordance with prevailing income limits.


<P>


<B>Associated Financing </B>will only be awarded


to countries with a GNP of less than 2,160 US$ per capita.


<P>


Provisional <B>transitional assistance </B>will be


awarded to create or recreate preconditions for economic and social


development in countries which are undergoing basic social restructuring,


usually in connection with the termination of armed conflict or


transition from a centrally controlled economy to a market based


economic system. Transitional assistance will be awarded for a


limited period and will be used selectively. Assistance will predominantly


comprise product supply, assistance to multilateral programmes


or programmes implemented by non-governmental development organizations,


supplemented by bilateral democratic efforts. cf section 3.2.2.


<P>


In addition, <B>Danish non-governmental development


organizations </B>can engage in assistance in a wide range of


countries and sectors according to their own specific priorities.


<P>


<B>Regional assistance </B>will only include bilateral


and multilateral assistance to interstate or non-governmental


regional institutions and organizations, as well as assistance


to regionally oriented activities in Programme countries. This


implies that bilateral governmental assistance activities outside


programme countries, which formerly comprised Part of the bilateral


regional programme, will be phased out. Bilateral co-operation


outside programme countries will only occur to the extent it is


estimated as reasonable in relation to the administrative costs


associated therewith.


<P>


<B>2.6 Multilateral Assistance</B>


<P>


The <B>fairly equal division </B>of Danish development assistance between Multilateral and bilateral assistance is maintained.


<P>


The Danish contribution to multilateral assistance


will concentrate, to a greater extent, on activity areas highly


Prioritised by Denmark. It will to a lesser degree be based on


the contribution levels within the individual organizations.


<P>


During the preparation of multilateral assistance


emphasis will be placed on <B>prioritizing and concentrating </B>policy


and Professional efforts, both between organizations and within


individual Organizations. At the same time, attempts will be made


to Promote co-operation and clear division of work between the


multilateral organizations involved,


<P>


TOP Priority areas will be assisted through intergovernmental


or nongovernmental Organizations, which - on a case-by-case basis


- are estimated to be in the best Position to administer development


assistance to the areas concerned. Consideration of Denmark's


<B>relative </B>size compared to other donors and <B>the load


division principle </B>will not be decisive in the allocation


of multilateral assistance.


<P>


Efforts to secure <B>Danish appointments </B>to


international organizations will be reinforced.


<P>


In the UN, Denmark will actively contribute to


the development of new <B>operational assistance </B>types, that


can form part of the civil component of UN peace keeping and conflict


preventive efforts.


<P>


In relation to development policy, Denmark will


co-operate within the framework of <B>the European </B>Union.


This will include a contribution to drawing up common development


policies and assistance through the development of a more cohesive


EU policy towards the developing countries, encompassing development


assistance and foreign policy, as well as trade, environment and


agriculture policy areas.


<P>


Denmark will work to maintain <B>Africa in focus


</B>also in terms of European development assistance efforts.


<P>


In relation to dialogue with the World Bank and


other international financial institutions on the formulation


of <B>structural adjustment programmes, </B>Denmark will attempt


to ensure that combating <B>poverty </B>and protecting especially


vulnerable groups, comprise an integral element of the banks'


activities, and that they are broadly anchored in recipient countries.


<P>


As a follow-up to the World Bank's and other multilateral


donors' work in Danish programme countries, and to contribute


to a <B>strengthened dialogue </B>between recipient countries


and multilateral donors, especially in relation to structural


adjustment programmes, initiatives will be taken in 1994 to hold


a number of regional symposiums. The participants will be experts


and decision makers from both Danish programme countries and multilateral


organizations.


<P>


One or more <B>trust funds </B>will be established


with The Global Environmental Facility and/or the World Bank with


a view to <B>co-financing </B>activities within high priority


assistance areas, that are comprised in the organizations' ordinary


project portfolios.


<P>


In addition, a number of <B>strategic funds and


contributions </B>will be established <B>to </B>assist the development


<B>of </B>multilateral organizations' work within high priority


areas. Earmarking Danish contributions will also be employed in


relation <B>to </B>assistance to increase the effectiveness and


reform endeavours of individual organizations.


<P>


Compared to present levels, the extent of <B>multi-


bilateral co-operation </B>with multilateral agencies will be


reduced. In the future multi- bilateral arrangements will be concentrated,


to a greater degree, on those organizations and sectors where


experience has proved positive.


<P>


The new <B>Special International Environment and


Catastrophe Facility </B>means that, in the long-term, a proportional


increase in catastrophe relief, financed under development assistance


arrangements, is not expected. In the coming years however, a


certain increase is expected as part of the more development oriented


and broad-spectrum emergency relief efforts.


<P>


<B>2.7 Crisis Efforts</B>


<P>


Efforts will be stepped up to safeguard the essential


relationship between short-term emergency relief efforts and long-term


development assistance, by, among other methods, the utilization of various


forms of <B>restructuring assistance.</B>


<P>


In relation to crisis situations of a more permanent


character there will, to the greatest possible extent, be a conversion


of efforts from traditional short-term emergency relief comprising


supplies from outside, to a more <B>broad-spectrum </B>assistance,


which as far as possible is based on social structures in the


recipient country.


<P>


Options available to relief organizations to develop


emergency relief Programmes in the <B>grey areas, </B>between


emergency relief and more long-term assistance will be expanded.


<P>


In close co-operation with authorities involved


and private emergency relief organizations, a new initiative will


be taken to establish an &quot;international <B>humanitarian capacity&quot;,


</B>comprised of volunteers from various professional groups,


who, on a short notice, can be deployed in support of Danish or


international relief efforts.


<P>


To avoid that longer term crisis efforts in non-programme


countries developing into small, semi permanent assistance programmes,


individual efforts will be organized in such a way that they do


not require a permanent Danish presence over and above emergency


relief and restructuring assistance for a <B>limited period.</B>


<P>


A survey will be initiated, in co-operation with


Private emergency relief organizations and Danish industry, to


determine the steps that can be taken to engage Danish business


and industry and increase the volume of <B>Danish supplies </B>in


connection with international relief efforts.


<P>


<B>2.8 Thematic Priority Areas</B>


<P>


The strategy aims at strengthening Danish efforts


on three thematic priority areas: population, trade and debt relief


<P>


 As part of upgrading Danish efforts in the <B>population


area </B>a sector strategy will be formulated on this topic in


1994.


<P>


The strategy will focus on activities of assistance


which aim at strengthening the women's and the families' possibilities


of <B>choosing </B>the number of children they want as well as


their spacing.


<P>


In the area of <B>trade policy </B>Danish efforts


will include: the promotion of greater cohesion in EU's development


policy and EU's trade and agricultural policies. In relevant trade


policy fora, Denmark will contribute to breaking down barriers


that hamper developing countries' exports of manufactured products


and thereby counteract diversification of their production systems.


In addition, efforts will be made to increase the integration


of developing countries in the international trading system.


<P>


Through development assistance Programmes Denmark


will support the <B>internationalization </B>Of developing countries'


enterprises. In addition, training programmes and education in


business and commerce, which contribute to the promotion of internationalization


of business and industry, will be granted.


<P>


In the area of <B>debt relief </B>Danish efforts


will include:


<ul>


<li>when the need arises, supplementary contributions


to <B>multilateral arrangements, </B>which aim at helping Denmark's


programme countries repay and service debt to multilateral financing


institutions, of which Denmark is a member, and


<li>in instances where a Programme country is heavily


burdened with debt to multilateral institutions, of which Denmark


is a member, to award <B>bilateral contributions </B>towards interest


payments and reimbursements, possibly including total repayment.</ul>

<P>


<B>2.9 Co-operation with the Resource Base</B>


<P>


The strategy recommends a closer co-operation between


the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the many elements of Danish


society, that in various ways co-operate with developing countries.


Provision is also made for strengthening the co-operation between


various non-state actors.


<P>


Intensified co-operation with the <B>resource base


</B>implies that interested parties from business and industry


and development organizations, as well as other parts of the Danish


resource base, will be involved in the formulation of new <B>country


strategies.</B>


<P>


In relation to the formulation of strategy agreements


with Denmark's programme countries, provisions have been made


for additional efforts to develop and strengthen partnership initiatives


or <B>&quot;twinning arrangements&quot;. </B>Where such partnership


arrangements open a perspective for broader participation and


establishment of co-operation relations between the professional


environment and institutions in programme countries and Denmark,


the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively encourage


the involvement of those institutions and professional groups,


with particular prerequisites for such involvement.


<P>


<B>3. The strategy's Implementation and Follow-up</B>


<P>


Denmark has formulated an ambitious goal for its


development policy. Relative to the needs of developing countries


and the overall economic relations between industrial and developing


countries, Danish development assistance is - still - very limited


in quantitative terms. This makes it difficult to establish a


direct causal linkage between development policy goals and the


effects of Danish development efforts.


<P>


<B>Evaluating </B>the direct


and indirect effects of individual activities and programmes,


fully or partly financed by Denmark, will therefore be the most


important instrument in evaluating the annual fulfilment of development


policy objectives.


<P>


Implementation of the strategy's main elements


will be the subject of <B>overall assessment in 1997.</B>


<P>


Global distribution <B>and utilization of Denmark's


bilateral assistance must </B>comply with a number <B>of broad


spectrum objectives. </B>These goals will apply globally over


a number <B>of years, but not necessarily for </B>individual programme


co-operation countries, <B>or in specific years.</B>


<P>


The strategy is reflected in the rolling-five-year-plans


which will include comprehensive analysis of the strategy's implementation


status, beginning in 1996.


<P>


Within the framework of the overall development policy


a number of priority areas will be selected in relation to <B>multilateral


co-operation. </B>At the mid-term review of the strategy implementation


in 1997, it will be established to which extent these priority


areas, in practice, have been managed, taking into account:


<ul>


<li>the distribution of multilateral assistance between


organizations, utilization of the administrative resources of


the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in <B>the </B>process of


continuous follow-up of co-operation with multilateral organizations,


and


<li>the establishment of and resource injection to


strategic, goal-directed funds in individual multilateral organizations.


<li>the evaluation of the increased involvement of


the Danish Resource Base in assistance co-operation must begin


by determining whether or not the quality of Danish assistance


efforts has been strengthened. Moreover, the effect will depend


on the quality of country strategies and sector assistance programmes,


that will bear bilateral assistance, and which will be formulated


in dialogue with the Danish resource base.</ul>

EU-LDC Trade and Capital Relations Network<br>Annual Workshops</h2>
E-mail: <a href="mailto:memedovic@NEI.NL">Dr. Olga Memedovic</a></center>
<p>
<hr><p>
The annual workshop deals with a topical issue which is considered crucial for a strategic relationship between EU-LDCs. During the early 1990s the transformation in the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) was one of the most important developments in this area. The issue has raised considerable concern among participants and economists in LDCs: Could trade and capital flows between the EU and the CEECs offer a substitute to interactions between the EU and LDCs, or could these flows be complementary to EU-LDC relations? The first workshop (May 1994) focused on this theme from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. Sector studies were included as some trade policy instruments are sector or product specific. Country studies highlighted differences in economic and political leverage. Papers were presented by academics from Europe and LDCs. Each paper was discussed by two speakers, a policy maker and a person with an academic background. Important topics of the workshop were trade creation and trade diversion as well as how trade and investment flows are affected by trade preferences. Most of the papers presented at the First Annual Workshop (May 1994) were published in January 1996 by Kluwer Academic Publishers as a volume titled Transition in Central and Eastern Europe Ñ Implications for the EU-LDCs Relations. This volume is the start of a new series dealing with the EU-LDC relations.
<p>
The 1995 Workshop of the Network focused on the topic: Globalization of Labour Markets - Challenges, Adjustment and Policy Response in the EU and LDCs. To the classical driving forces of migration such as poverty, oppression and war, yet another is being added: globalization. With the increasing economic interdependence between countries migration has become one of the important links. Many LDCs accept migration of their workers to developed countries because it reduces the pressure on their labour market, and remittances increase capital flows to the country. On the other hand, some of the developed countries see migration as a threat to their  employment and system of social security. Participants of the 1995 Workshop gave a broad view of the problem which developed and LDCs are facing in connection with the globalization of labour markets. The proceedings and the summary of the discussions of the 1995 Workshop are positively assessed by anonymous reviewers and will be published by the same publisher as the second volume titled: Globalization of Labour Markets - Challenges, Adjustment and Policy Response in the EU and LDCs. The forthcoming book consists of 11 chapters by scholars from the EU, the CEECs and LDCs which are presented in four parts: 1) Conceptual Issues; 2) Exporting Goods or Labour: Experiences of and Consequences for LDCs; 3) Private Sector Response; and 4) Policy Response in the EU and LDCs. This will be the second volume in the EU-LDC Trade and Capital Relations series. The publication is scheduled for the end of 1996.
<p>
The 1996 Workshop of the Network focused on the topic: External Resources for Development - With Particular Emphasis on the Role of the EU. Recent years have witnessed a sharp decline in developed countries spending on development assistance (aid). Yet, at the same time, many LDCs have demonstrated an ability to attract foreign private capital. They have abandoned development strategies based on active state intervention in allocating resources and promoting growth and have turned instead towards outward-oriented development strategies based on openness and an increased role for market forces. This latter strategy relies on a dynamic and expanding private sector to increase economic growth and efficiency and generate employment and income, but it also requires structural adjustments (i.e. upgrading private sector-led growth, creating an appropriate environment for enterprises, an efficient banking sector and efficient government) for which external financial and technical support is necessary. 
<p>
The end of the Cold War (in 1989) also triggered new demands on aid budgets. New thinking about development issues, liberated from the constraints of competing ideologies, has seen the emergence of the new paradigm of sustainable development. This is considered to be an integrating process of political and economic stability, good governance, capacity building, improved technical cooperation, human resource development, reliance on market forces, concern for the environment and promotion of the private sector. Such a catalogue of change has brought into sharp focus the issue of aid effectiveness and the measurement of results obtained through development assistance from the perspective of both the donors and the recipients. 
<p>
The goal of the 1996 Workshop was to contribute to the thinking about the prospects of official development assistance, and other official and private capital flows. Important questions raised during the workshop were: How can foreign resources be optimally targeted to stimulate development and how can they best be evaluated in terms of their results? What should LDCs do to benefit most from external resources (official and private)? What are the determining factors of external resource supply?
<p>
The programme comprized three sessions. Session I gave an outline of the theoretical and conceptual issues and the analysis to date. Within this session two papers were presented: one dealt with Private Finance and Development Issues and the other concentrated on Whether or Not Aid can Eliminate Aid Dependence? Session II focused on External Resource Supply and was divided into two subsessions: a) The Extent and Structure of External Resource Supply and b) Determining Factors of External Resource Supply. The latter had four short papers including: Dilemmas in Donor Aid Strategies; The Effectiveness of Development Aid; Determination of Private Capital Flows, and South-South Cooperation and External Resource Flows. Session III focused on Regional and Sectoral Patterns of External Resource Supply - Emphasis on Effectiveness of External Resource Supply to Different Regions.
<p>
In each session papers were presented by academics from Europe and LDCs. This was followed by a discussion by two (three) speakers, a policy maker and a person with an academic background from the developed countries and from LDCs. The Management Team of the Network succeeded in attracting high level academics and policy makers to participate in the workshop programme by either presenting or discussing paper. The Management Team has also tried to find good balance between academics and policy makers as well as a sufficient representation from the various LDC regions. Currently the editors are preparing material from the Third Annual Workshop (May 1996) for reviewing and assessment for publication during 1997. This will be the third volume in the EU-LDC Trade and Capital Relations Series.
<p>
At the Third Annual Meeting of the Network Steering Committee, held on 15 May 1996, it was decided that the 1997 Workshop should focus on the topic: <A HREF="w4.htm">Multilateralism and Regionalism in the Post-Uruguay-Round Era: What Role for the EU</A>? the Workshop will be held on 12-13 May 1997 in Rotterdam.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=1> </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=2>DEVELOPMENT

CO-OPERATION FALLS FURTHER BEHIND AS AN EU PRIORITY AS EUROPEAN

PARLIAMENT 1997 BUDGET CUTS MONEY FOR  CO-OPERATION</FONT></B>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The adoption of the EU

budget at its second reading by the European Parliament, EP, on

12 December may confirm the fears of many involved in international

co-operation of the relegation of development co-operation to

matters of lesser importance by the European Union. The EP in

line with its quest for austerity adopted an uncharacteristically

slim line budget for 1997 and there were hardly any differences

between the first and the second reading. Unfortunately, development

co-operation seems to be the sector which has been sacrificed

to achieve the near 0% growth in the budget over last year. (See

table provided in the last two pages of the PAF)</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Despite lobbying from the NGO community (Mr. Brinkhorst,

rapporteur of the budget committee,  received more than 200 letters

from NGOs), the Budget Committee agreed on the figure of 160 MECU

+ 36 MECU in reserve for co-finnancing of NGOs. This 36 MECU in

reserve would only be released after agreement by the Development

Committee. The Committee wants to have more control on this reserve

and will set up the conditions, be more strict and limiting. The

conditions will be set on the basis of reports from Reylandt,

(we do not know what the criteria will be yet). The DGVIII B/2

has to give a report to the Development Committee before May 1997

on how the funds are to be used.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> In the table the 'M' in the second column means

that those lines have been merged with the co-financing line,

so they will be administrated by the DGVIII. There is also a significant

reduction in the funds for rehabilitation. The Council had wanted

to decrease it to 50 million ECU, while the Parliament demanded

75 million and the 62.5 million represent the compromise between

the Council's proposal and the Parliament's. The B7-321 (Rehabilitation

in Southern Africa) is also part of the reserve. The B7-611N (Role

of women in development) has been created by the Parliament; it

should include the B7-633.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The rest of the sectorial budget lines are the same

as in 1996. There is a huge increase for the MEDA line, but the

line for NGOs has been suppressed. Concerning the Central and

Eastern Europe line, there is a new line for ex-Yugoslavia, which

is quite substantial. The B7-6008N is a line created to repatriate

the refugees with temporary asylum in Europe.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> On the whole it has been a quite difficult year

in the fight to maintain a decent level of funding for development.

NGOs need to be on the alert in the coming years. Member States

are trying to reach the level demanded of them to enter the EMU

system, which means that in the future there will be less money

for development. NGOs will have to step up the pressure on the

national governments. The Development Committee will start working

on the budget early in the next year.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>  Although the budget for 1996 has been entirely

allocated, there are still some problems in its provision. The

general conditions for funding have not been settled yet. There

are some advances from the Dutch government, who are planning

to take some decisions on this issue during their Presidency.

NGOs in Luxembourg will be pushing this issue during Luxembourg's

Presidency<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. BUDGET COMMITTEE REJECTS PARLIAMENTARY VOTE

ON ALLOCATION FOR TURKEY</FONT></B>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>In a major development

since last week's adoption of the budget, the Budget Committee

on Tuesday 17 December overruled the total allocation of 62 967

million ECU for Turkey under the MEDA programme.  The allocation

which came from two different budget lines had been agreed on

in the vote on the budget and had angered many MEPs who protested

Turkey's continuing poor human rights record and interference

from the Council and the European Commission. The European Parliament

has now threatened to freeze the entire budget for Turkey under

the MEDA programme if the European Commission does not bow to

its demands for the creation of a joint committee for approving

individual programmes in the MEDA package. The EP wants to examine

each programme to determine if it would benefit Turkey, and if

so to block it. Turkish officials have reacted saying that the

cut in funding will not hurt Turkey. They however concede that

the symbolic significance is great as it puts Turkey in a worse

category than Algeria and Syria who continue to receive money

from the EU. &quot;To compare us with those regimes is ridiculous

.... We are being treated pretty badly&quot; said a Turkish diplomat.

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTS EU URGE TO PAY GREATER

ATTENTION TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND CALL FOR A EU HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> With the adoption of its annual report on human

rights the European Parliament has asked for greater clarification

on aid conditionality so as to avoid  ambiguity in future agreements

with the likes of Turkey and Russia. Rapporteur Cath&eacute;rine

Lalumi&egrave;re, President of the Radical Alliance Group, said

that  preventive diplomacy requires international control of the

arms trade and a code of conduct for European Companies carrying

out activities in Third Countries. Mrs. Lalumi&egrave;re criticised

the council for its hesitations on human rights infringements

in Bosnia, Rwanda, Chechnya, Zaire, China and Turkey. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The EP report asked the ACP-EU Joint Assembly not

to schedule plenary sessions in countries where co-operation is

suspended. It also outlined EU priorities for 1997  as - support

to the international tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,

establishment of democratic institutions in former Yugoslavia;

the inclusion of systematic rape to the list of war crimes; the

launching of programmes for reconciliation of civil society; confirmation

of European programmes in for reconstruction and development in

South Africa, the Near East and Bosnia Herzegovina.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>   During a debate on the report several MEPs criticised

the Union's attitude on human rights. As Jan Bertens, a Dutch

Liberal,  put much of the argument being made succinctly, &quot;economic

interests must never prevail over human interests&quot;. Mr. Jose

Barros Mouta expressed his hope that the year 2000 would be proclaimed

as the Year of Human Rights by the Union. In defence of the Union,

Hans van der Broek, Commissioner for External Affairs said that

a network designed to gather necessary information for conflict

prevention was currently being set up. He stated however, that

a code of conduct could not be imposed on European multinationals

and that even though he thought that every year should be a Year

of Human Rights, he had recommended the proclamation of 1998 to

be European Year of Human Rights in line with the fiftieth Universal

Declaration on Human Rights. <BR>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DEBATES THE FUTURE OF DEVELOPMENT

CO-OPERATION</FONT></B>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>On Tuesday 17 December,

in a debate largely centring on the European Commission's recent

Green Paper on the future of EU-ACP co-operation, the European

Parliament's Development Committee discussed the future of the

EU's development co-operation with the EU Commissioner for Mr

Joao de Deus Pinheiro and other development experts.   </FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Pinheiro, expounded

on some of the Green Paper major themes such as the need for more

conditionally in aid provision and the need to develop a new political

partnership between the two regions. He cautioned however, that

the Green Paper in no way pre-empts the Commission's future position

on the ACP-EU relationship but was rather a document to encourage

debate. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Among those invited to provide constructive criticism

on the Paper was Mr Claude Cheysson who is a former Commissioner,

French Minister, European Parliamentarian and one of the negotiators

of the first Lom&eacute; Convention. Mr. Cheysson outlining his

misgivings about the Green Paper criticised the increased emphasis

on conditionally, warning that the Commission would have to be

very careful in implementing this policy as it could easily be

misconstrued as a case of the EU taking the decisions sovereign

African countries have to take. He added that political dialogue

between the two groups should be promoted to the fore and as much

as possible the identity of the poor African countries should

be preserved. Commenting on the general view of the difficulty

of maintaining equality of the partners in the ACP-EU relationship,

Mr. Cheysson compared the Lom&eacute; Convention to the US's Marshall

Plan after  the second world war which according to Mr. Cheysson

achieved success because of the equality of partnership between

Europe and the USA.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Mr. Pinheiro's sudden departure following Mr. Cheysson's

speech, provided a humorous point for discussion giving that Mr.

Pinheiro had said earlier that he was ready to openly discuss

issues raised in the Green Paper.<B> </B>Others present however

remained to express their views on the issues. The Netherlands

Foreign Minister Mr. Pronk reassured the MEPs that the forthcoming

Dutch Presidency would carefully listen to the requests of ACP

countries. Mrs. Kinnock of the Socialist group criticised of the

lack of co-ordination between the EU's policies in other sectors

with its development policies while Lord Plumb of the Christian

Democrats lamented on the lack of progress on the EU's Common

Foreign and Security Policy. Several speakers called for the European

Development Fund used to finance the Lom&eacute; Conventions to

be included in the regular EU budget. <BR>

<title>Newsflash 1996 - Cattle Crisis: Britain's BurgerGate and Yaks in Yushu</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<center><h2>Cattle Crisis: <br>Britain's BurgerGate and Yaks in Yushu </h2></center>

<p>
Two simultaneous cattle crises are driving farmers to despair in two very different parts of the world. In Tibet, an unexpectedly prolonged winter has meant that a thick blanket of snow still lies heavily in regions that should, by now, have had stalks of spring grass appearing between light sprinklings of snowflakes. 
<p>
The yaks are starving to death. In some regions, like Yushu province, as many as 80% of the yak herds have already died, reducing the nomads who depend on these herds as their sole source of income to desperation.
<p>
Not that much information, however, is available via the world's media about the plight of these farmers who live - even in good years - on the edge of survival. The big cattle crisis is the one in Britain.
<p>
Here, the problem appears in reverse: cows that should have been killed many years ago were not.  Several scientists had argued since the early 1980s that 'mad cow disease' (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE) might be dangerous not only to cattle but also to humans. They feared a possible link between BSE and a new strain of the human brain affliction Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD).
<p>
Although no-one knew what, if any, the link might be, these scientists believed there was enough evidence to give cause for serious concern - and that the public should therefore be warned of the possible danger until clearer answers were found. 
<p>
Beef, in their view, could not be considered innocent until proven guilty: it had to be treated as suspicious until it was exonerated.
<p>
Britain's Conservative government, however, repeatedly took the opposite line, that BSE did not jump species from cows to humans - though the government's critics claimed that it has chosen put the interests of its supporters in the beef industry before its duty to protect public health.
<p>
One Minister, John Selwyn Gummer, unforgettably fed his small daughter a hamburger in front of the cameras to prove how confident he was that eating beef was perfectly safe. It was a smash-hit photo-opportunity - but one he might well be regretting since the revelations that have been emerging over the past few days. 
<p>
On Thursday 21 March, Ministers were forced to announce that 10 patients had been identified as suffering from a new and aggressive form of CJD, where the most likely cause was consuming beef. The Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg tried to calm the public outcry with the reassurance that extra new measures would be implemented to cut out all risk of infected meat from reaching the public - but it has been reported that as many as 40% of the slaughterhouses visited by food inspectors in lightning raids last autumn were failing to implement even the old, basic measures. 
<p>
Revelations of a Watergate-like cover-up have also shocked the British public.  On Saturday 23 March, the Guardian newspaper reported that: <p>
<i>'Whitehall knew for six years that beef from BSE-infected cattle might kill humans. Nothing was done. Except that experts who warned of deaths were vilified, had their funds cut or lost their jobs. Others were burgled and threatened, one man's home was burned.'</i>
 <p>
Among these scientists was Dr Harash Narang, a world expert in BSE. According to journalist Sarah Boseley, Dr Narang had established back in 1988 that BSE's infectious agent was linked to DNA. If he turned out to be right, this means, terrifyingly, that the infectious agent would be present in the best steak, freely available on supermarket shelves, as well as in the offal that had been officially banned.
<p>
He also began to create a same-day test that would detect infection in live cows - an invaluable device, says Boseley, since the Ministry of Food and Farming's tests could only work on slaughtered animals. Dr Narang applied for a MAFF grant to research his test - and:
<p>
<i> 'All seemed fine until he suggested that he would collect bovine heads from the local abbatoir rather than wait for MAFF to send him samples of BSE brains. Narang believes that MAFF officials suddenly saw an abyss opening at their feet. If Narang conducted random tests, the true proportion of cattle infected with BSE - and heading for butchers' shops - would become clear... There was no grant. 
<p>
Strange things happened to Dr Narang during this time... His car tyres were slashed five times, his brakes tampered with and his Newcastle flat broken into and his research papers messed up.'</i>
<p>
Stephen Dealler, a consultant microbiologist at Burnley Hospital, produced alarming data that eating any beef was risky - but says his fndings were brushed aside by Seac (the government's committee for investigating BSE). He says of Dr Narang's work:<p>
<b><i> 'His test worked in front of me. He is the guy who could have saved us.'</i></b>
<p>

It now appears that as many as a quarter of Britain's 11 million cattle may have to be killed, at a cost estimated at some 8 - 12 billion pounds (US$ 12 - 18 billion). It would have been far cheaper - as well as far more public-spirited - for the British government to have followed the Irish government's example and killed fewer cattle earlier.
<p>

<p>
STOP PRESS: McDonald's, the fast food chain, which has consistently maintained that its beef products are safe, has now announced that it is suspending the use of British beef in its burgers.

<P>

<B>1. REDEPLOYMENT OF  COMMISSION'S OVERSEAS STAFF</B>

<P>

 In accordance with the shift of interest in the European Union's

external relations the European  Commission is to complete its

redeployment exercise of delegation staff from various African

Caribbean Pacific (ACP)  countries to Asia, the Mediterranean

and Eastern Europe by the end of the year. This is intended to

reinforce offices in areas it now considers to be of increasing

importance to the Union. 

<P>

 Despite the efforts of Development Commissioner Joao de Deus

Pinhero to resist the downsizing of ACP delegations, 23 'A'Grade

posts in the ACP countries the are being redeployed to countries

such as New Independent states in Eastern Europe, Algeria and

Jordan from the Mediterranean and Bangladesh, India and Thailand.

Five of these posts however will  be used to strengthen the Commission's

activities in Southern Africa. 

<P>

 This exercise is a reflection of  the Union's current review

of its traditional ties with ACP countries and it's increasing

focus on Eastern Europe Asia and the Mediterranean. According

to senior Commission officials the redeployment is also a part

of a fundamental review of the breakdown between its permanent

and local staff in its 126 offices around the world. The Commission

is facing growing pressure from the European Parliament to reduce

its running costs and it believes that increasing the number of

local staff it hires would not only reduce its external relations

budget but also free full-time EU staff from more mundane tasks.

The Commission will however have to take account of the negotiations

taking place at the Intergovernmental Conference.  

<P>

<B>2. MEPS CRITICISE COUNCIL AND COMMISSION'S DECISIONS ON DEVELOPMENT

BUDGET</B>

<P>

 Members of the European Parliament Committee on Development and

Cooperation have criticised the European Council and European

Commission's decision to cut the co-operation budget for the Third

World by 10% in Strasbourg.  According to the members of the Committee

cuts will reduce humanitarian aid by 2.49% and other cooperation

measures by 13.35%. 

<P>

 Furthermore the Development Committee stated that the least developed

countries were being unduly penalised at the expense of other

more developed countries. The European Union is set to increase

its spending on the MEDA programme (Euro Mediterranean partnership)

from 400 to 800 million ECUs in its 1997 budget. The Development

Committee called for this money to be reallocated to the poorer

areas of the world in Africa and for MEPS to oppose heavy cuts

in the co-operation budget.

<P>

 The Development and Cooperation Committee's demand come as EU

governments aim to cut the Union's external budget by 15%.

<P>

<B>3. EUROPEAN UNION WELCOMES OUTCOME OF CONGRESS AGAINST SEXUAL

EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN</B>

<P>

 The European Union stated its approval of the Declaration agreed

to at the World Congress of Against the Commercial Exploitation

of Children held in Stockholm from 27 to 31 August. The Declaration

emphasised the need  for partnerships between governments and

international organisations to be forged in order to prevent the

sexual exploitation of children. 

<P>

 The Union, on its part, stated its intentions to press ahead

with its efforts to put an end to what it called 'modern day slavery'

and have the traffic of human beings be declared a criminal offence

internationally.

<P>

<B>4. EU OFFICIALS REMAIN CAUTIOUS ON SITUATION IN THE GREAT LAKES

REGION</B>

<P>

 Mr.Ajello, the European Union's special envoy to Great Lakes

region in Africa expressed  his continuing anxiety over the political

situation in Bujumbura in talks with Mr Joao Pinhero on for development

on Monday, 16 September. Mr Ajello made his conclusions after

talks with political leaders and international observers including

the President of the Hutu guerrilla movement, CNCD, and the US

state department.  He stated that in spite of the changes by the

Buyoya regime towards democratic normalization the political situation

in Burundi is still a cause for concern.

<P>

 This comes after the Commission delegation was called from Bujumbura

for consultation and Mr.Pinhero's call for the suspension of aid

to Bujumbura following the 25 July coup d'etat. Although the EU

has not at yet forrmally suspended aid to Bujumbura, with the

exception of humanitarian assistance, EU aid is not reaching Burundi

because of the embargo by countries in the region. The situation

in the region will be reviewed at the forthcoming General Affairs

Council on 1 and 2 October.

<P>

<B>5. EU TO CLARIFY POSITION FOR FIRST WTO MEETINGS AT INFORMAL

SESSION IN DUBLIN</B>

<P>

 EU Trade Ministers are meeting with Irish minister Enda Kennedy

in preparation for the forthcoming  World Trade Organisation (WTO)

scheduled on the 9 and 13 December in Singapore. The ministers

aim to come up with common positions and guidelines on the following

issues to be on the Singapore agenda. 

<P>

<ul>

<li>the problem of ensuring third countries respect of Uruguay Round

Undertakings for opening markets to Community exports.

<P>

<li>the problem of the maintenance of the momentum of the liberalisation

of world trade in sectors excluded from the Uruguay round.

<P>

<li>whether EU wants new multilateral negotiations on the liberalisation

of  World trade

<P>

<li>if new international rules are needed in the area of competition

and investment

<P>

<li>whether greater importance should be attached to the environmental

and social aspects of international trade.</ul>

<h3>APARTHEID'S LEGACY OF POVERTY</h3>
<hr>
For generations, institutionalised racism - for the last 50 years through the vicious system of apartheid or separate development - and economic policies favouring the white minority interacted to form an economy characterised by serious structural weaknesses and a deep divide between the affluence of a privileged few alongside the extensive poverty and social deprivation of the majority. 
<p>
The apartheid system also discouraged the systematic collection of key social and economic data, especially those relating to the black majority; thus, the accuracy of key economic statistics remains seriously in doubt. This presents the incoming government with problems in designing social and economic programmes for the new South Africa. It also means that the poverty data available are only approximate.
<p>
Today, South Africa is inhabited by about 40 million people. According to the racial classification used in the census, some 76% of the population are categorised as black, 13% as white, 8.5% as coloured, and 2.5% as Asian. Around 8% of the population, the vast majority of them white, account for 90% of personally-owned wealth. In contrast, between 30% and 50% of the population, almost all of whom are black, live below the poverty line. 
<p>
A quarter of blacks live in what were termed the 'independent homelands' of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei and Venda, another third in the so-called 'non-independent homelands', comprising Gazankulu, KaNgwane, KwaNdebele, Kwazulu, Lebowa and QwaQwa. The remaining 42% live mainly in townships on the outskirts of the major metropolitan areas, their number swelling daily with rural migrants. One third of black urban households have incomes below the minimum income level, but the ratio rises to some 83% of households in the 'homelands'. 
<p>
The apartheid system controlled not only where people lived but their every movement (through the infamous pass laws). Almost 2 million blacks officially designated as 'homeland' residents are migrant workers. An additional three quarters of a million people commute daily to work, often taking many hours to travel. About one third of all formally employed black men live apart from their families. 
<p>
In aggregate, it is estimated that
<p>
<ul><li>one in four blacks in South Africa live in squatter camps or crude temporary housing;<br>
<li>over 40% of blacks have no access to clean water; - about 50% of blacks are illiterate and one in four children are not in school; and<br>
<li>only some 10% of rural blacks have access to basic sanitation, and only 5% have access to electricity.<br>
<li>poverty afflicts proportionately more women and girls than men and boys.
</ul><p>
In the 15 year period to 1992, state spending on black education has risen by 15% a year, compared with increases of 9% for coloureds and only 3% for whites. Yet, today, the poorest 50% of the population still receive only about one fifth of total state spending on education, health, housing and social welfare. 30% of state spending on secondary schooling, 65% of state spending on university education, and 75% of capital expenditure on tertiary education goes to whites.

<HR>
<P>
<b>
Britain's traditionalism, its ties to its former colonies and
its chronic economic problems explain its contradictory image
as a mediumlevel donor, yet one which continues to play a dominant
role in multilateral organizations.</b>
<P>
Britain's development aid policy has been shaped by three radical
historical changes which have determined the country's policy
as a whole, and its foreign policy in particular:
<ul>
<li>its relative economic decline from a 19th century world power
to its present position as a European power;
<li>the breakup of what had been the world's largest colonial
empire and the formation of the Commonwealth; and
<li>its entry into the European Community following a lengthy
and controversial national decisionmaking process, together with
the renunciation of a special role in world politics.
</ul><P>
Because of their colonial past, contacts with the Third World
are a part of everyday life for the British people. But deeper
knowledge of it and more serious interest in it is limited to
the very active and relatively large 'development community' (NGOs,
individual MPs, academics, scientists and journalists). Most of
the British people regard themselves as 'not so well off', which
accounts for their relative lack of developmental commitment.
<P>
On the other hand, British academics and government experts, with
their background of experience gained during the colonial days,
have from the start greatly influenced and occasionally dominated
the international debate on development policy. They are very
much present in most multilateral institutions, providing direct
consultancy services to the governments of many developing countries.
<P>
During a phase of colonial development, which can be dated as
beginning in the 1930s, many concepts which were to reappear in
the years following the colonies' independence were discussed
and tested. After the Second World War, the Colombo Plan, elaborated
under British direction and proclaimed in 1950, can be regarded
as the starting point of Britain's development cooperation efforts.
It resulted in many years of successful cooperation between industrialized
members of the Commonwealth and the countries of South and Southeast
Asia.
<P>
<B>Development institutions</B>
<P>
Since 1964 there has been a central British development cooperation
authority, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), whose
status and administrative arrangement have frequently changed.
But its mandate, internal structure and staff have remained largely
stable. Since the Conservatives came to power in 1979 the ODA
has been attached to the Foreign Office as a semiautonomous 'development
wing', headed by one of the FO's three secretaries of state. In
the previous five years it was the Ministry of Overseas Development
under a minister without portfolio.
<P>
In addition, two other ministries are substantially involved in
the planning and management of development cooperation. These
are the Exchequer, with responsibility for the budget and links
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Ministry of
Trade and Industry, responsible for UNCTAD and GATT/WTO. But the
latter ministry sees its development policy function as in particular
promoting Britain's export industry through the Aid and Trade
Provision (ATP), a mixedfinancing instrument.
<P>
The differentiated system of decentralization is a British peculiarity.
The pure administration of development cooperation is handled
by the aid sections of Britain's embassies (with seconded ODA
officials in important recipient countries). There are five regional
Development Divisions, in Bangkok, Barbados, Lilongwe, Nairobi
and (since 1993) Pretoria, as well as a country office in Bangladesh.
All of these have sectoral experts who, depending on the extent
of the projects manage bilateral development cooperation in their
area of responsibility largely on a decentralized basis. They
support the London headquarters in planning, implementing and
monitoring, especially in programme aid and structural adjustment
measures. In addition, consultation and coordination are handled
by the Regional Advisory Group in Fiji and the Dependent Territories
Regional Secretariat in Barbados.
<P>
Other implementing institutions with long experience of the Third
World include the Crown Agents (procurement authorities), the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (similar to Germany's DEG),
the British Council, as well as respected research organizations
such as the Overseas Development Institute or the Institute of
Development Studies.
<P>
The ODA's cooperation with British NGOs has been intensified in
recent years, but is still comparatively modest. During 1993/94
the Joint Funding Scheme disbursed &#163;29 million in enbloc
grants to five established NGOs, as well as project subsidies
of up to 50 per cent to numerous others. Britain's four development
services, including NGOs, were subsidized with about &#163;20
million for the employment of their 2,000 development aid workers
in 55 host countries.
<P>
<B>Quantitative trends</B>
<P>
Until the Thatcher government took over in 1979 there was a high
degree of continuity in Britain's development cooperation in applying
instruments, the quality and quantity of aid provided, and regional
alignment on the Commonwealth, despite several changes of government
and corresponding changes in organizational structures. But since
then there have been pronounced changes. Development cooperation
is under pressure from two sides:
<P>
&#183; as a result of the government's saving and consolidation
policy, the development cooperation budget shrank in real terms
for many years. The real volume of development cooperation during
the 1990s has also been below that of 1979. The official development
assistance (ODA) share of GDP has also dropped. In 1978/79 Britain's
ODAGDP ratio was 0.49 per cent, but is now 0.31 per cent (see
Table 1).
<P>
&#183; against the backdrop of British industry's diminished competitiveness,
the companies and the Ministry of Trade and Industry have increasingly
pushed development cooperation as an export promotion tool. Thus,
strict tieing of aid applies not only to the ATP mixed credits,
but essentially to overall project assistance and most of the
programme aid.
<P>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<caption><b>Table 1 : Quantitative trends</caption></B>
<tr><td><td>1978/78<td>1983/84<td>1989/90<td>1993/94

<tr><td>Total flows in US$bn<td>25.0<td>11.3<td>7.0<td>10.1
</table>
<P>
Noteworthy is the decline in total financial flows to developing
countries since 1978/79, which is mainly the result of greatly
reduced new bank credits and simultaneous repayment of old debt,
especially in Latin America. By far the greatest part of aid is
provided as grants, so that Britain is consistently among the
leading donor countries in terms of grant element. The multilateral
share of aid has increased from 30 per cent in the 1970s to almost
50 per cent in the 1990s, mainly due to contributions to the European
Development Fund.
<P>
In bilateral aid, great value is placed on programme assistance.
As a rule, it is granted in close conformity with IMF standby
agreements and World Bank structural adjustment loans. Technical
Cooperation, which under the British system consists mainly of
seconding experts to recipient countries and paying the costs
of foreign students and trainees in Britain, accounts at times
for almost 50 per cent of bilateral ODA. Currently, it is being
revised in favour of local specialist staff and increased employment
of shortterm experts.
<P>
<B>Concentration on important recipient countries</B>
<P>
As before, British development policy is characterized by a strong
affinity for former colonial areas, whereby developmental links
are only one element of close economic and political ties.
<P>
About 70 per cent of bilateral aid still flows to Commonwealth
countries. About 4050 per cent of regional ODA is concentrated
on the 10 most important recipients, which traditionally include
India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi and, since recently,
once again Uganda. The shift in geographical distribution from
Asia to subSaharan Africa is shown in Table 2.
<P>

<P>
<B>Trends in concepts and practice</B>
<P>
The last comprehensive government document on British development
policy was its White Paper of 1974. Since then there have been
many stepbystep conceptional and practical changes. At present,
for example, the focus is on implementing the resolutions of the
UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de
Janeiro in 1992. Seven Agenda 21 goals were formulated which have
since become obligatory for Britain's bilateral and, so far as
possible, multilateral development cooperation. These include
liberalizing economies, increasing production capacity, promoting
good governance (administration, the legal system, democracy),
alleviating poverty, the promotion of education, health, family
planning and women, and securing the environment.
<P>
The changes at the conceptional, as well as the practical, level
of development policy, have always been evolutionary in Britain.
That is, they have been about making efforts to accept the international
debate on development strategy, but at the same time not allowing
the gap between expectations and the reality imposed by political
tensions to become too great. As a result, Britain's development
policy has to date maintained a comparatively high degree of credibility.

(DIE) from1976-86. Since1991, he heads a section for development
policy in the German Development Service (DED) in Berlin.

<h2>VSO is not a relief agency sending emergency supplies.</h2>


VSO aims to work in long term sustainable development. Most volunteers go overseas for two years. Teaching and training people in developing countries is what VSO does and this takes time. The need is not simply for another 'pair of hands'.  In reality, without a skill to offer you are just another mouth to feed. Volunteers always use the skills they are trained in. You have to be able to contribute positively.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. HUMANITARIAN ACTION IN GREAT LAKES REGION IS

NOT ENOUGH SAY PARTICIPANTS OF EU MINISTERS OF DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION

MEETING <BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>A special meeting of the European Union's Ministers

for Development Co-operation was held on Thursday 7 October to

discuss the ongoing crisis in the Great Lakes region. Irish Minister

Joan Burton who opened the session asked the participants to consider

the following key issues - access to the vulnerable populations

following an agreement between the Rwandan, Zairian and rebel

forces; effective delivery of humanitarian assistance to the refugees,

promotion of a safe and dignified return of the Rwandan refugees

in Zaire; ensuring the short-term aid does not create an unsustainable

camp situation and not contradict the political goals of attaining

greater regional stability.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>At a press conference later in the day Mrs Burton

stated that the Meeting had confirmed the absolute urgency of

the setting up of corridors to allow the safe return of Rwandan

refugees in Zaire as all participants were concerned about the

serious risk of an epidemic that the refugees currently faced.

EC Commissioner for Development, Joao de Deus Pinheiro stated

that the means and resources were available but the major problem

remaining was how to get the means and resources through to the

victims. Mr. Akashi, Deputy Secretary General for the UN's Humanitarian

Aid Department described the situation in the region as &quot;a

humanitarian calamity without comparison&quot;. He added that

the political questions such as who would get the aid through,

who would protect the corridors and where the corridors would

be situated will have to be addressed as pledge of humanitarian

assistance was just not enough. Mr Akashi hinted that a neutral

multinational force could contribute towards a more comprehensive

approach.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The participants provided further details answering

questions on the state of affairs in the region. On sending a

neutral force Mrs Bonino, EC Commissioner for Humanitarian assistance

said that clear conclusions had been reached at the Regional summit

in Nairobi and the case had now been referred to the UN Security

Council. She said that it was now up to the Security Council to

set up the mechanisms defined in Nairobi. Mrs Ogata, the UN High

Commissioner for Refugees, confirmed that the Rwandan authorities

had agreed to open up safe corridors through Rwanda and the remaining

concern was for the Zairian section.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The EU Ministers later adopted a resolution calling

for the UN Security Council to react immediately to the Nairobi

proposal in setting up safe corridors and a neutral international

force. According  to Mrs Burton the question of the composition

of the neutral force was not discussed at great length at the

Meeting as this was an issue for the Security Council to discuss.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission earlier on Wednesday said

it will release a further 25 million ECU for humanitarian aid

in the region. The Commission, which has been following events

in the region through the &quot;Crisis Cell&quot; set up by the

European Commission Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has already released

540 million ECU for humanitarian aid in the region since November

1993.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The EC also stated that it will insist on the setting

up of &quot;humanitarian points of reference&quot; such as the

known position of refugees; the precise identification of available

stocks; the transport routes for distribution of stocks and rapid

contacts with Member States which are willing to provide material

and transport for humanitarian action. <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT CALLS FOR REFORMS

OF EU'S CFSP AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>After the seventh meeting of the Intergovernmental

conference totally dedicated to issues surrounding the Common

Foreign and Security Policy last week, Klaus Haensch the European

Parliament, EP, president, said at a press conference, that the

CFSP has to be &quot;identified by a person who has a sufficiently

long mandate. .. someone within the Commission.&quot; According

to Mr Haensch this idea had little support and another alternative

was for an eminent politician to front CFSP but this idea had

also been received coolly. Mr Haensch also stated that if the

EU does not have military instruments it would not be able to

have a long term credible CFSP. On the EU'S external economic

relations, Mr Haensch said that the Parliament would like to put

an end to disjointed EU foreign policy and that article 113 had

to be widened to include services direct investment and intellectual

property. Mr Haensch however, conceded that realisation of these

proposals will be a long term process requiring a step by step

approach.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. EU SENDS INQUIRY MISSION TO BURMA AS IT TIGHTENS

SCREWS SLORC REGIME<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Manuel Marin, Vice President of the European Commission

announced on Wednesday 6 November that the Commission will be

sending an inquiry mission to Burma in the near future to check

up on the Burmese regime (SLORC)'s action on the practices on

forced labour in the country. This inquiry could lead to the suspension

the benefits of the generalised system of preferences for Burma.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Last week the EU Council decided to impose new sanctions

on Burma, namely the ban on entry visas to the EU for senior SLORC

and military officials and their families and suspension of high

level bilateral government visits. These measures were taken because

of the Burmese government's refusal to respond to EU and UN concerns

over human rights violations in the country. Earlier this week

the Burmese foreign minister announced that Burma is planning

retaliatory sanctions against the EU. <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EUROPEAN VESSELS ACCESS TO FISH IN SENEGALESE

WATERS SUSPENDED AS EU/ SENEGAL NEGOTIATIONS OVER A NEW AGREEMENT

THE BREAKDOWN<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The fishing activities of European vessels in Senegalese

water have been suspended following the breakdown in negotiations

between the EU and Senegal on a new fisheries protocol in Dakar

last week. This fallout especially concerns financial compensation

paid by the EU as a counterpart for fishing rights in Senegalese

waters. Senegal is demanding 18 million ECU a year as a financial

counterpart while the EU has proposed only 10 or 12 million ECU.

Senegal has also asked for the EU fishing quota to be reduced

to 10 000 gross barrels from 13 500 in a previous fisheries protocol

signed in 1994.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>No date has been set for the resumption of negotiations

and most European vessels will now seek to redeploy in waters

of neighbouring countries with whom the EU has signed agreements.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>5. LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO RECEIVE AID FROM

THE COMMISSION TO PARTICIPATE IN MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE IN SINGAPORE

<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The European Commission will make funds available

to the least developed countries in order to enable them to participate

in the first Ministerial Conference in Singapore. The Commission

will provide 50 000 ECU which will cover at least 20 % of total

costs necessary for the participation of the Ministers and a second

officer from the least developed countries. The Commission hopes

that this financial support will help the least developed countries

to take an active role in the Singapore Ministerial Conference.

The Conference will be held from 9 to 13 December. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>6. COMMISSION'S GREENPAPER ON LOME ALMOST READY

</FONT></B>

Commission's Greenpaper on the future of the Lom&eacute; Convention

will be submitted to the full Commission within the coming two

weeks.<BR>

<center><b>The Legal Problem of Humanitarian Assistance</h1><p>
<h3>Florentino Ruiz Ruiz</b></h3></center><P>
<center><h4>Summary of an article published in <I>Afers Internacionals</I>, no. 28</h4></center>
<hr>
<p>
The donating of assistance to those people in grave need presents the case for
examining the contents of what is known as humanitarian assistance, for
determining its field of application, for looking at those to whom it is
addressed and at those who are able to offer it. Also, given that this
assistance is capable of being offered in very different situations, of putting
both peace and international security in danger or of dealing with events which
have nothing to do with it, both the General Assembly of the UN as well as the
Security Council have shown how they are related in determined circumstances.
The assistance can be offered by governmental institutions or dependents of
international organizations such as through Non-

Governmental
Organizations putting forward new questions about the principle of non-

intervention.
Furthermore, in those cases in which assistance cannot be offered with the
consent of the territorial State, or, in the case of armed conflict, of the
contending sides, its very effectiveness necessarily involves the establishment
of some system of protection for those who offer assistance, and to try and
assure the arrival of help to those to whom it is destined.<p>
<p>
Conceived and shaped by the Resolutions of the General Assembly with respect to
state sovereignty, the offering of humanitarian assistance does not mean that
it does not imply limits to the sovereignty of the States and that the need to
make it effective does not impose obligations upon them, which as they regard
guaranteeing basic human rights such as the right to life or physical well-

being
can, for their connection with the latter, constitute obligations erga omnes.
In any case, it is a developing institution, as well as with regard to its
legal consequences, whose real effectiveness must advance by way of identifying
rights which are harmed in the case of the offer for assistance being refused
or impeded it and the consequences which such interference carries with it.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. DENMARK CONSIDERS THE INCLUSION OF COUNTRIES

LIKE BANGLADESH, NEPAL AND VIETNAM TO LOME CONVENTION</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> According to information from Copenhagen, Danish

Minister for Development, Mr Paul Nielson, has called for countries

like Nepal, Vietnam and Bangladesh to be included in the Lom&eacute;

Convention. Mr Nielson called for a Community policy based on

the criterion of poverty as well as OECD recommendations adding

that the historical links between certain EU Member States and

former colonies should no longer be the foundation for EU development

policy. &quot;Some better-off states within the Lom&eacute; Convention

should receive less aid, but could, in exchange benefit from more

trade guarantees and greater access to the European Union markets&quot;

said Mr Nielson. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Earlier Mr Nielson, along with a Danish delegation,

met with the ACP Committee of Ambassadors in Brussels. The Committee

led by Mr Youssouf Ouedraogo, Ambassador of Burkina Faso and President-in-Office

of the Committee and Mr Lingston, Ambassador for Trinidad and

Tobago and Chair of the Sub Committee on 'future relations with

the ACP', met the Danish ministers to discuss fundamental issues

relating to the EU/ACP partnership and to identify areas in which

the ACP/EU partnership 'must adjust to world geopolitical realities'.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Mr Nielson and Mr Jorgen Estrup, Chair of the Danish

Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, informed their partners

of the ongoing reflection in Denmark on the Commission's Green

Paper and development co-operation in general. They announced

that a conference involving all the Danish participants in development

co-operation will be held this year on 14 March in Copenhagen.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Denmark  is the first EU Member State to take the

initiative to begin an open and informal debate with the ACP countries

on the future of the EU/ACP relationship, in response the Green

Paper's efforts to encourage debate and dialogue on the issue.

<BR>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. FIRST ACP HEAD OF STATES SUMMIT ON POST LOME

IV TO BE HELD ON 6-7 NOVEMBER IN LIBREVILLE</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The ACP Committee of Ambassadors have set a date

and venue for the first ACP Heads of State summit solely devoted

to the future of ACP/EU relations. The summit will be held on

 6-7 November 1997 in Libreville, Gabon. The idea for the summit

was conceived in Mauritius at the end of the signing of the revised

Lom&eacute; IV Convention and it will serve as an essential stage

of the discussion process in the run up to negotiations on a new

framework for the ACP/EU Co-operation in 1998. In accordance with

Mauritius Declaration, the summit will &quot;examine development

issues in an appropriate political framework and finalise the

strategy that must underpin future ACP/EU relations&quot; from

the point of view of the ACP countries. The summit will be preceded

by an extraordinary council of ACP foreign ministers and ministers

responsible for the Lom&eacute; Convention on 4-5 November in

Libreville. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. PINHEIRO CALLS ON AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO SPEED

UP CONFLICT PREVENTION MECHANISMS AND REGIONAL CO-OPERATION</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EC Commissioner responsible

for the ACP and South Africa, has appealed to African political

leaders to speed up conflict prevention and regional co-operation

mechanisms in order to create an environment conducive to stability

and economic growth.  Mr Pinheiro, on his first official visit

to East Africa, made this appeal during talks with the Heads of

State of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and the Secretary General of

the Organisation for African Unity, OAU, on the current tensions

and conflicts in the region. The Commissioner recalled that the

principles of good management in public matters and the respect

for human rights are key elements of EU development co-operation

policy. He emphasised the EU's efforts in promoting lasting peace

and stability in the Great Lakes region through the work of its

envoy to the region, Aldo Ajello. Mr Pinheiro expressed his hope

that an international conference on the Great Lakes region will

be held, organised under the auspices of the UN and the OAU.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. DAC COMMENDS EUROPEAN COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE

TO LDCs BUT CALLS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF TRANSPARENCY AND CONTROL</FONT></B>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The Development Aid Committee,

DAC, of the OECD praises Community development policy for its

&quot;distinctive and ambitious goals&quot; but notes that the

EC still has a lot of progress to make on the road to control

and transparency, in its annual report &quot;Development Co-operation&quot;,

published on 5 February. In a chapter devoted to the Community,

the DAC states that the EC has &quot;introduced improved procedures

for designing and managing projects and upgraded the evaluation

programme&quot;. It adds that, concerning management, emphasis

had been placed on transparency and progress in country strategy.

This is expected to improve the focus and coherence of aid programming

at country level and the integration of different EC aid instruments

and policies. However, it states that &quot;the Commission needed

to strengthen further both its in-house and contracted capabilities

to plan, manage and implement its new generation of projects&quot;

adding that it would be advantageous if one independent and credible

evaluation unit covered the entire EC ODA programme. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The report recalls that Community aid to developing

countries increased from USD $ 4.8 million in 1994 to USD $5.4

billion in 1995 and that the Community is the second donor body

after the World Bank. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of Community

aid is still the greatest (56% of ODA) but is decreasing compared

to that to the Mediterranean countries in North Africa and the

Middle East (16% of bilateral ODA) and Latin America (10%). The

share of aid for emergency and humanitarian aid greatly increased

from 1% in 1988/89 to 14% in 1994.  </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> On the whole, world public aid for development co-operation

continues to decline. Payments by DAC countries to developing

countries and multilateral organisations fell by 9% in real terms

in 1995. In total, ODA accounted for less than 0.27% of the global

GNP of DAC member countries in 1995. The largest fall in ODA is

recorded in the USA where it represents only USD $ 2 per inhabitant

per month as compared to USD $ 12 for France and USD $14 for Denmark

and Norway. <BR>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>5. EU WELCOMES SUCCESS OF AFRICAN MEDIATION IN

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The Dutch Presidency on behalf of the European Union

published a declaration on Wednesday welcoming the success of

African mediation efforts in putting an end to the recent conflict

in the Central African Republic. The Declaration stated, &quot;The

Union would like the successful African mediation in settling

the conflict in the area of Central Africa, mediation undertaken

under the impetus of the Heads of State meeting at the Ouagadougou

Summit of December 1996, to be an encouraging example for on-going

mediations in other situations of conflict..&quot;<BR>

VSO is an international development agency, sending volunteers to share their skills with other people so they can make their own way in the world. Being a volunteer isn't backpacking. It's usually a two year commitment to living and working in the local community. Volunteers are professional individuals with an ability to pass on their skills to others.

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Chinese Dissident Wei Jingsheng Jailed</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="823308" alink=#d9d919 vlink="#FF7F00">
[ONEWORLD NEWS SERVICE]
<p>
<b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>


<h2>Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng jailed for 14 years</h2>


<p>

<b>Wednesday 13 December</b><p>

The Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng was jailed for 14 years last night, after being found guilty of conspiring to overthrow the Chinese government.<p>

The judges took a mere five hours to reach their decision.  The Chinese government had claimed that the trial would be open, but diplomats and journalists were prevented from entering the courtroom.<p>

The trial, at the Intermediate People's Court in Beijing, was carried out under heavy security, as police roped off the area around the building.  Wei faced the death penalty if convicted.<p>

Wei Jingsheng is regarded as the leader of China's fragmented and disillusioned dissident movement, most of whose members are now either in jail or in exile abroad.  He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this year.<p>

Although relatively unknown within China, Wei is well-known around the world for his uncompromising criticism of the country's Communist government.  He has described China's ageing paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, as a dictator in the worst tradition of Chinese emperors.<p>

Wei Jingsheng - who had been a Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution - first fell foul of Chinese government repression in 1979, when he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for counter-revolutionary activities.<p>

At that time he was active in the Democracy Wall movement - named after the large political posters put on a wall at the side of Beijing's Tiananmen Square - and called for a 'fifth modernisation' of democracy to accompany the 'four modernisations' of economic development.<p>

Wei was released from prison in September 1993, after serving nearly all of his 15 year sentence - much of it in solitary confinement.  He was rearrested in April 1994 and held incommunicado for 19 months before being officially charged with sedition on 21 November 1995.  Wei Jingsheng has spent only 6 months in the last 16 years as a free man.<p>

The verdict of his trial is being seen as a sign of the Chinese government's determination not to give ground on the human rights issue.  This attitude was encouraged earlier this year by the United States' decision to renew China's most favoured nation trading status despite continuing human rights violations.<p>

Wei has himself condemned the attitude of Western governments and business leaders, whose interests he said would ultimately be harmed by their lack of interest in pushing for democratic reform in China.<p>

<h1 align=center>INDEX INDEX C-E</h1>

<h4>CAMBODIA</h4>

Six men charged with incitement on August 14 for distributing leaflets critical of the government (Index 5/1995, p81) were released from prison on 18 September, after the charges were dropped. On August 28 King Sihanouk had written to the prime ministers asking that they be given an amnesty.<p>


It was reported on 2 October that the Thai-owned International Broadcasting Corporation (IBC), Cambodia's only independent television station, is to be taken over jointly by the Ministry of Defence and a new Thai company. Co-defence minister Tea Bahn said: 'We will use the channel to broadcast military news, training and exercises.' (Human Rights Task Force)<p>


On 6 October the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of Chan Rotana (I<i>ndex </i> 2/1995, 5/1995), editor of <i>Samleng Yuvachan Khmer   </i>(Voice of Khmer Youth). The court also agreed to a prosecution request to change the charge from article 62 (misinformation) to article 63 (defamation). Rotana's original sentence, of a year in prison and a 5 million riel (US$2000) fine, was upheld, even though defamation carries a lesser penalty than misinformation. (Reuter, Human Rights Task Force)<p>


On 13 October the Court of Appeal also upheld the conviction for defamation of Thun Bun Ly, editor of <i>Odum K'tek Khmer </i>(Khmer Ideal) (<i>Index </i>5/1995). He was ordered to pay a fine of 5 million riel (US$2000) or be imprisoned for one month. The newspaper was ordered to shut in two months. The charge stemmed from a letter to the editor on 30 October 1994, which referred to the prime ministers as 'barking'. Thun Bun Ly said he would have printed a retraction had the government asked for one. (Reuter, Human Rights Task Force)<p>


Cambodia's two prime ministers have asked a court to press criminal disinformation charges against Michael Hayes, publisher of the English-language <i>Phnom Penh Post </i>(<i>Index </i>5/1995, p81). Hayes has received no formal notification of the charges and First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh has said he does not wish to close the paper down. (Reuter, <i>International Herald Tribune </i>)<p>


Three truck-loads of men armed with poles and axes broke into the offices of the paper <i>Serei Pheap Thmey </i>(New Liberty News) on 23 October. They ransacked the offices, destroyed equipment and injured an office worker, Dour Bunma. Police who arrived at the scene while the attack was in progress reportedly did nothing to intervene. (Human Rights Task Force)<p>


Recent publication: <i>The War Against Free Speech </i>(HRW/Asia, September 1995, 15pp); <i>Impunity in Kampot </i>Province (AI, October 1995, 10pp)<p>


<h4>CANADA</h4>

In September the Supreme Court ruled that the Tobacco Products Control Act (1988), which bans most forms of cigarette advertising and promotion, violates tobacco companies' constitutional right to freedom of expression. (<i>Financial Times</i>)<p>


Stephane Beaudoin, a cameraman with CHOT television in Hull, Quebec, was jailed for contempt of court on 19 September after refusing to name a source before a preliminary hearing in an assault case brought against a Hull police officer. He was freed on 22 September after the defence lawyer agreed to retract his question to Beaudoin, freeing him from the obligation to reveal the source. (CCPJ)

<h4>CHILE</h4>

Protests that marked the 22nd anniversary of the military coup that toppled President Allende erupted into violence on 11 September. Police used tear gas and water canons to disperse thousands of protesters in central Santiago and outside the cemetery where Allende is buried. Officials said the protests were stronger than usual owing to recent tensions between the military and the civilian government. (Reuter)

<h4>CHINA</h4>

Xin Hong, who had been held for eight months for 'leaking state secrets' to her son, exiled police official Gao Peiqi, was released from detention in May. (AI)<p>


Dissidents and their relatives were subject to police surveillance and detention over the period of the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing. Qi Zhiyong, a Beijing resident, was detained without warrant on 28 August. Xu Shuiliang was served a 15-day detention order on 5 September in Nanjing. Wang Zhihong, wife of Chen Ziming (<i>Index </i>4/1995), was ordered to move to the jail where her husband is imprisoned on 29 August, and stayed there for about a month. Yan Huili, wife of Zhang Xianliang, was also moved from her home in Shanghai and sent to her husband's labour camp. During the conference Wang Lingyun (mother of dissident Wang Dan) and Zhu Hailan were kept under 24-hour surveillance and told to report their telephone conversations to police. Huang Xiang and his wife Zhang Ling were not allowed to go to Beijing and Jiang Qisheng was called in for questioning daily. (AI)

<p>
Liu Gang, released from prison in June, was sentenced to 15 days' detention in Liaoyuan for breaching parole conditions. The 13 conditions imposed on Liu included a requirement to report his 'thoughts and activities' to the police every week. Liu was released after 10 days and since then he and his family have been under police surveillance. Christian activists Gao Feng and Liu Fenggang were detained in Beijing in early August in connection with the Liu case - a draft appeal on behalf of the dissident was found at Gao Feng's home and confiscated.

At the NGO forum running alongside the UN Conference, Tibetan delegates were subject to especially heavy surveillance. They were routinely followed and their movements and exchanges were filmed by plainclothes police. NGO video footage of interviews with Tibetan women was confiscated by staff at the Shan Hu Hotel. At a workshop organised by Tibetan women, police attempted to seize a video on forced abortions and sterilisations in Tibet, but lost the tape after a scuffle with members of the audience. The forum's official newspaper - <i>Forum '95 </i>- disappeared for a day in early September after it criticised the arrangements at the forum and carried material from an organisation that had not been granted a licence to publish. Chinese-language materials on the global lesbian movement were seized from the lesbian tent at the forum by Chinese Organizing Delegates. (<i>Guardian, Independent, Sunday Times</i>)

<p>
Private businessmen were prohibited from joining the Communist Party in mid-September. In response to criticism that this could hamper careers, Beijing suggested that collective enterprises could still be considered for membership. Individual businessmen who do not hire staff are still eligible. (Reuter)

<p>
Film director Zhang Yimou was reportedly advised by Beijing officials at the end of September not to attend the New York film festival, where his <i>Shanghai Triad </i>was to be the opening film. China had complained about the inclusion of a US-made documentary, <i>The Gate of Heavenly Peace</i>, about the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. A year ago, Zhang was banned from working on <i>Shanghai Triad</i>, from working with foreign film companies for five years and from attending any international film festivals, after the unauthorised screening of his film <i>Lifelines</i> at the 1994 Cannes film festival, where it won two awards. The sanctions against him were reversed, however, after he submitted a 'self-criticism' about sending the film to Cannes without permission, saying that the fact he had not gone to Cannes himself was 'an expression of his attitude and of his respect for the examination departments' and that he had no desire to undermine 'the image of the country'. (<i>International Herald Tribune</i>, Reuter, <i>Lien Ho Pao, Ming Pao</i>)

<p>
The first Sundance film festival to be held in China took place between 5 and 12 October. The event was a showcase for US and Chinese independent films, all of which were allowed to be screened uncut. However some Chinese film makers voiced concern that if restrictions on the number of foreign films China imports each year are lifted, it could seriously threaten the local film industry. (Reuter)

<p>
Chen Ziming (<i>Index </i>4/1995) went on hunger strike on 13 October at Beijing No 2 prison in protest at his continued imprisonment, the confiscation of his property, the freezing of his bank account, and the authorities' refusal to allow him medical attention: he is suffering from cancer. On 22 October Chen's wife, Wang Zhihong, was detained by police after family members staged a sit in at a Beijing park. Police also prevented several foreign journalists from covering the protest. (Reuter, SWB, <i>South China Morning Post</i>)

<p>
At least 10 leading signatories of pro-democracy petitions circulated in May (<i>Index </i>4/1995) remain in detention but only one, Deng Huanwu, has been charged and tried. The detainees include Liu Xiaobo, Wang Dan, and Liu Nianchun. (AI)

<h4>COLOMBIA</h4>

Hernando Valencia Villa, who resigned in August as deputy attorney-general in charge of human rights, flew to Madrid on 1 September, where he was granted political asylum. He had received death threats after calling for the dismissal of General Alvaro Velandia, who is linked to the murder in 1987 of M-19 militant Erika Bautista. On 11 September President Samper ordered Velandia to be dismissed, the first time a military general has been removed for human rights violations. (Reuter)

<p>
On 20 September unidentified gunmen killed at least 24 people and injured another five in a massacre outside the town of Apartado, in the region of Uraba. Banana workers, most of them members of the local Hope, Peace and Freedom party, were forced from a bus which had been stopped by a makeshift roadblock and then shot. President Samper immediately introduced emergency measures in the area, allowing police to conduct arrests, summary searches and seizures without warrants. On 3 October another similar attack in Uraba left two banana plantation workers dead. (Reuter)

<p>
On 24 September Jesus Emilio and Luis Tiberio Galvis Barrera, members of the Community Action Movement of Aguachica, (MACA), were stopped by a heavily armed group of men, some wearing the insignia of the Counter-Insurgency Task Force, while travelling by road from the village of Yeura, department of Cesar. They were later found tortured and beheaded. Later the same day an armed group, believed to be the same one that abducted the Galvis brothers, ransacked the communal shop in the village of La Morena, municipality of Aguachica, and reportedly killed the local police inspector, Emelda Ruiz. (AI)

<p>
Antonio Jose Cancino, President Samper's lawyer, was attacked and wounded on 27 September on his way to his office in Bogot. One Administrative Department of Security (DAS) agent was killed and two members of the bodyguard corps injured in the attack, which followed death threats against the lawyer who is defending Samper against charges that his presidential campaign was funded by drug cartels (<i>Index </i>5/1995). (Reuter)

<p>
A new paramilitary organisation called the Henry Perez Group issued a letter in early October, threatening the lives of 23 union leaders and politicians in Barrancabermeja who it claims are linked to various left-wing insurgent groups. (SWB)

<h4>COTE D'IVOIRE</h4>

On 20 September the government issued a decree banning 'all marches and sit-ins' for a three-month period. The ban comes at the beginning of the presidential election campaign, to be followed by legislative and municipal elections later this year. Access for opposition political parties to the national media has also been restricted. (A19)

<p>
The offices of the <i>Nouvel Horizon </i>newspaper group were destroyed by fire on the evening of 16 to 17 October. The fire, which appears to have been set deliberately, followed violent demonstrations on 16 October by opponents of the government calling for a boycott of the presidential election. (RSF)

<h4>COSTA RICA</h4>

On 4 August the body of David Maradiaga, head of communications and campaigns for the Costa Rican Ecology Association (AECO-Friends of the Earth), was discovered in the city morgue nearly three weeks after he disappeared. The authorities claimed that Maradiaga had been there since 14 July. Maradiaga had been working on a campaign against the Canadian mining company Placer Dome, currently negotiating exploration rights over a rich, tropical forest zone with the governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Maradiaga's death adds to the series of suspicious deaths of Costa Rican environmentalists. On 7 December 1994 a fire in the home of two AECO members, Oscar Fallas and Maria del Mar Cordero, killed them and their director, Jaime Bustamant. (<i>Latinamerica Press</i>)

<p>
On 25 August Andres Borrasse Sanaou, the publisher of <i>La Prensa Libre</i>, was ordered to pay 5.6 million Colons compensation in a case brought by Carlos Campos of the Union of Small Atlantic Flower Growers. Campos objected to claims in the paper that the union was undergoing militarisation. Borrasse has said he will appeal. (IAPA)

<h4>CROATIA</h4>

A new election law, passed in September, reduces the number of seats in Parliament from 138 to 127, of which only 28 will be elected by direct district vote and 12 will be elected by party lists among registered voters working abroad. The threshold for entry to Parliament is raised from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of the total vote. The number of seats reserved for the Serbian minority is reduced and the Bosnian Muslim minority - Croatia's second largest ethnic minority - has no guaranteed representation at all. Opponents of the law say it favours the ruling Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ). (OMRI)

<p>
On 8 October an election coalition of five opposition parties protested Croatian Television's decision to treat them as a single entity and not five separate parties, thus limiting them to only one block of free airtime. The opposition Croatian Social Liberal Party also protested a television ban on its promotional videos, which have also been banned by the company that owns most of the country's cinemas. Unbalanced news coverage and curbs on television access have been criticised by observers from the Washington-based National Democratic Institute, which has expressed concern over the fairness of the elections. (OMRI, Reuter)

<h4>CUBA</h4>

Independent journalists Rafael Solano and Yndamiro Restano (<i>Index </i>4/1995) were interrogated by state security officials in Havana on 15 September. Their families were warned that the state could not take responsibility for any future violent action against them because of their 'illegal activities'. (CPJ)

<p>
On 19 September the new Independent Press Bureau of Cuba (BPIC) issued its first press release. Several journalists working for the Bureau, run by Yndamiro Restano, have been warned by police that they must find work with a state organisation or face prosecution for 'dangerousness'. On 3 October Roxana Valdivia, BPIC's Camagey correspondent, was detained by state security agents for twenty hours. Her equipment and documents were confiscated and she was ordered to return to Camagey and to abandon her professional duties in Havana. Since Valdivia's release her telephone line has been cut. On 4 October Maria de los Angeles Gutierrez, the Bureau's accountant, was detained by security forces for several hours and told to find another job. She was detained again on 12 October. On 7 October BPIC journalist Olance Noguera was given a similar warning by police in Cienfuegos. And on 10 October Hector Peraza Linares was picked up by police in Quiricam and threatened with a charge of 'vagrancy'. (AI, RSF, CPJ)

<h4>EGYPT</h4>

Youssef Chahine's popular film <i>al-Muhajer </i>(The Emigrant) (<i>Index </i>1/1995, 2/1995, 3/1995) was banned for the second time on 31 August on the grounds that it contravenes Islamic rulings about depiction of prophets. The film was first banned in November 1994 after a case was brought against it by an Islamist lawyer. Chahine successfully appealed against the ban in March but a counter-appeal was subsequently filed. (Reuter)

EL SALVADOR

A draft bill before Congress would allow only the attorney-general's office to release information to the press about legal cases. The bill would make it a criminal offence for any other official - such as a judge or police officer - to issue such information, and for any media outlet to publish it. It is feared that the measure could be used to withhold information pertaining to cases of government corruption. (IAPA)

<h4>EUROPEAN UNION</h4>

On 5 October the EU Social Affairs Council called on European publishers, broadcasters and advertisers to end sexual stereotyping in the media. A non-binding resolution adopted by the Council said that 'advertising and the media can play an important role in changing attitudes in society by reflecting the diversity of the roles and potential of women and men'; that stereotypes can harm mental and physical health; and that the media must find new ways to portray men and women. The resolution was criticised by the European Newspaper Publishers' Association for 'introducing censorship'. (Reuter)

<h1>About Index</h1>

<i>Index on Censorship </i>was founded in 1972 by Stephen Spender. Its aim was, and still is, to protect the basic human right to free expression. Over the past years <i>Index </i>has reported on censorship issues from all around the world and has added to the essential debates on those issues. Each issue of <i>Index </i>contains a list of attacks on free expression Ñ compiled country by country. These lists remain as extensive today as they were in the early days of <i>Index. </i>They are a trenchant and harrowing reminder that continued vigilance is essential.
<p>

The list of writers who have contributed to <i>Index </i>is an impressive testimony to its continued importance. They include Vaclav Havel, Nadine Gordimer, Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Arthur Miller, A S Byatt, Aung San Suu Kyi, Noam Chomsky, Julian Barnes, Dubravka Ugresic, Ronald Dworkin, Umberto Eco, Jack Mapanje and Naguib Mahfouz. <i>Index</i> is also a forum for new writers of whom the world will hear more.
<p>

But perhaps the most telling testimony is that which we receive from readers in those countries where censorship is a life and death issue. <i>Index </i>operates an assisted subscriptions programme which allows readers in South America, Africa, Asia, and the former Communist countries to receive the magazine free of charge. The letters which we receive from readers in these countries are a telling demonstration of the magazine's importance.

&quot;[<i>Index]</i> is greatly respected in our country.<br>&quot;
<i>Human Rights Organisation, Colombia</i>
<p>

&quot;I would like to thank you for this great offer which I'm unable to keep to myself but keep on offering to others who don't receive to also enjoy and see what goes on in other parts of the world. This has created more effort in self-expression.&quot;<br>

&quot;<i>Index</i> has taught me a lot of things. 1. Respect peace. 2. Not to forget history. 3. Respect human rights. 4. To learn for future development.&quot;<br>

<i>Index </i>is supported by its associated charity Writers and Scholars Educational Trust. It is funded by subscriptions and donations from individuals and foundations. A year's subscription to <i>Index </i>costs just £36 (£42 overseas, $50 USA). There is a special student rate of £25 or $35 world-wide.

Amnesty International believes she is a prisoner ofconscience. <P>The "important state secrets" were allegedly divulged in fourarticles Gao Yu wrote for two Hong Kong publications. They reportedly concernedstructural reforms within the Chinese Communist Party and civil service system,and other political issues. The court verdict against Gao Yu does not indicatethat the alleged "state secrets" concerned matters of national security. Chineselegislation on "state secrets" is vague and the meaning given to "state secrets"very broad. It covers matters that would be the subject of public scrutiny inother countries and goes far beyond what is needed to protect national security.<P>Gao Yu was arrested on 2 October 1993. Her final trial was held in secret, andneither her husband nor her lawyers were notified in advance, as required by law.This followed a series of grossly unfair judicial proceedings. She was triedthree times in 1994. Each time the court found that the evidence against her"still needed to be verified", which means it was insufficient for conviction.Each time, however, instead of releasing her, they returned her case to theprocuracy for further investigation. Finally, on 10 November 1994 the BeijingIntermediate People's Court sentenced her to six years in jail. <P>Gao Yu is nostranger to political imprisonment. As a prominent intellectual in the 1989pro-democracy movement, she was one of the first to be arrested following thecrackdown on the protests. She was held without charge or trial for 15 months andher time in prison devastated her health. <HR><A HREF="china3.html"><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="cchina.gif">Previous page</A>\<p><hr><a href="../index.html"><img align=bottom src="../amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif"> Amnesty International Home Page</a><br clear=all><hr></BODY></HTML>

<I>Les conditions pos&eacute;es &agrave; l'octroi de l'aide (respect
des droits de l'Homme, d&eacute;mocratisation, bonne gestion &eacute;conomique)
puisent davantage leur l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; dans l'histoire
que dans le droit.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Dans la perspective d'un monde global, lib&eacute;r&eacute; des
clivages id&eacute;ologiques, l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement adopte
de nouveaux modes d'intervention. Elle est d&eacute;sormais officiellement
li&eacute;e &agrave; la r&eacute;forme de l'&Eacute;tat b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
selon quatre axes : respect des droits de l'Homme, d&eacute;mocratisation
des institutions politiques, adoption d'une v&eacute;ritable &#171;gouvernance&#187;
&eacute;conomique et r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;penses militaires.
<P>
<H3>Une entreprise ambitieuse</H3>
<P>
C'est la premi&egrave;re fois qu'une telle tentative de r&eacute;former
le comportement et le fonctionnement des &Eacute;tats a lieu hors
d'un contexte de guerre. La seule entreprise d'envergure comparable
remonte en effet &agrave; la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale
avec la refonte des institutions et pratiques politiques au Japon
et en Allemagne. N'&eacute;tant pas aujourd'hui en position de
vainqueur, les &Eacute;tats et les institutions internationales
qui veulent promouvoir ces principes doivent convaincre les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
de la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; de leur projet.
<P>
La plupart des agences de d&eacute;veloppement soulignent le caract&egrave;re
&#171;universel&#187; et non culturel des normes qu'elles pr&ocirc;nent.
En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, les conditionnalit&eacute;s s'appuient
sur des bases juridiques variables et leur histoire est faite
d'interpr&eacute;tation et d'application <I>ad hoc</I>.
<P>
La conditionnalit&eacute; des droits de l'Homme est de loin celle
qui repose sur le corpus l&eacute;gal le plus solide, &eacute;tabli
par un grand nombre de trait&eacute;s internationaux et r&eacute;gionaux.
A l'autre extr&ecirc;me, la r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;penses
militaires irait &agrave; l'encontre du principe de non-intervention
dans les affaires d'un &Eacute;tat souverain. La d&eacute;mocratie
appara&icirc;t comme une norme internationale hybride : elle ne
fait l'objet d'aucun trait&eacute; international sp&eacute;cifique,
mais en revanche l'arsenal juridique d&eacute;velopp&eacute; par
les organisations internationales en faveur des droits de l'Homme
d&eacute;fend les composantes m&ecirc;me d'un r&eacute;gime d&eacute;mocratique
(libert&eacute; d'expression, participation politique et droit
des peuples &agrave; &eacute;lire leurs dirigeants).
<P>
Les principes de <I>good governance</I> &eacute;conomique et de
r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;penses militaires contiennent des
&eacute;l&eacute;ments normatifs importants mais ne disposent
d'aucune base juridique. Cr&eacute;&eacute;s par les organisations
financi&egrave;res internationales et en compl&eacute;ment des
plans d'ajustement structurel, ils &eacute;ludent la question
de leur l&eacute;galit&eacute; en s'appuyant sur le besoin de
rationaliser la politique &eacute;conomique. Ces objectifs s'inscrivent
dans un discours d'&eacute;conomie du d&eacute;veloppement qui
occulte les conditions politiques de leur r&eacute;alisation :
la gouvernance suppose un gouvernement fort et responsable, capable
de mener des r&eacute;formes parfois douloureuses, de lutter contre
la pr&eacute;dation des ressources publiques et d'assurer la participation
effective de tous. De m&ecirc;me, les d&eacute;penses militaires
devraient &ecirc;tre jug&eacute;es en fonction de besoins raisonnables
en mati&egrave;re de s&eacute;curit&eacute; interne ou externe.
Mais le d&eacute;bat porte uniquement sur le pourcentage des richesses
nationales qui constituerait la norme des &#171;bonnes d&eacute;penses
militaires&#187;.
<P>
<H3>Des principes d&eacute;j&agrave; anciens</H3>
<P>
Contrairement aux id&eacute;es re&ccedil;ues, ces conditionnalit&eacute;s,
au moins les trois premi&egrave;res, ne sont pas une nouveaut&eacute;.
Les droits de l'Homme sont au centre de la vie politique internationale
depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale, avec une accumulation de textes
et de conf&eacute;rences. Certains pays ont li&eacute; leurs relations
diplomatiques au respect de ces droits, comme les &Eacute;tats-Unis
depuis 1960 ou l'Allemagne depuis 1980. N&eacute;anmoins, dans
le contexte de la guerre froide, les gouvernements ont rarement
appliqu&eacute; ces principes. Seule la force de l'opinion publique
a permis d'initier des mobilisations internationales. L'action
d'Amnesty International en est l'illustration la plus &eacute;clatante.
Ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, cependant, les engagements
bilat&eacute;raux et surtout multilat&eacute;raux en faveur des
droits de l'Homme se sont multipli&eacute;s. Les r&eacute;solutions
des Nations unies sur l'Irak ou Ha&iuml;ti t&eacute;moignent d'un
recours croissant &agrave; l'arsenal juridique disponible.
<P>
La pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence d&eacute;mocratique fait &eacute;galement
partie des politiques occidentales depuis 1945. En particulier,
elle a marqu&eacute; le transfert du pouvoir lors de la d&eacute;colonisation
des ann&eacute;es 1960. La d&eacute;mocratie &eacute;tait presque
totalement absente durant la p&eacute;riode coloniale, mais au
moment de l'ind&eacute;pendance l'id&eacute;e de l&eacute;gitimation
par les &eacute;lections semblait incontournable. Cette attitude
est devenue la r&egrave;gle des Nations unies lors des accessions
&agrave; l'ind&eacute;pendance. Les &eacute;checs r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;s
de ces exp&eacute;riences ont toutefois d&eacute;courag&eacute;
chercheurs et politiques de promouvoir la d&eacute;mocratie. Aussi
le d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique a-t-il pris le pas sur
le d&eacute;veloppement politique dans la r&eacute;flexion sur
l'avenir des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s du tiers monde. Au d&eacute;but
des ann&eacute;es 1990, cependant, la d&eacute;mocratisation s'est
&agrave; nouveau impos&eacute;e comme norme de &#171;bon comportement
de l'&Eacute;tat&#187; pour les bailleurs occidentaux. Les nouvelles
d&eacute;mocraties, les consultations &eacute;lectorales de l'Est
et du Sud ont b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; d'un fort soutien
financier et logistique. Cet enthousiasme s'est &eacute;mouss&eacute;
&agrave; partir de 1993 devant les d&eacute;viations de certaines
transitions et la r&eacute;ticence des &Eacute;tats asiatiques
&agrave; adopter des normes per&ccedil;ues comme un produit culturel
occidental. Ces r&eacute;sistances ont conduit les donateurs &agrave;
adopter une attitude plus prudente. L'Allemagne, qui conditionnait
juqu'alors son aide &agrave; la nature du r&eacute;gime politique,
s'est align&eacute;e sur la pratique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de
&#171;condition positive&#187; o&ugrave; l'aide r&eacute;compense
les &eacute;volutions favorables &agrave; la d&eacute;mocratie.
<P>
Le terme de gouvernance, quant &agrave; lui, a &eacute;t&eacute;
popularis&eacute; par les travaux de la Banque mondiale &agrave;
la fin des ann&eacute;es 1980, mais des principes voisins &eacute;taient
expos&eacute;s d&egrave;s les ann&eacute;es 1960. La d&eacute;finition
apolitique de la Banque satisfait la plupart des bailleurs occidentaux,
car elle donne une direction et une l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; nouvelles
&agrave; des programmes de coop&eacute;ration de plus en plus
d&eacute;cri&eacute;s. Mais elle n'&eacute;nonce pas de strat&eacute;gie
claire pour atteindre l'objectif de bonne gouvernance.
<P>
<H3>Multilat&eacute;ral contre int&eacute;r&ecirc;t national</H3>
<P>
Le principe de r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;penses militaires
est la v&eacute;ritable nouveaut&eacute; des ann&eacute;es 1990.
Introduit par le Fonds mon&eacute;taire international en 1991,
il a ralli&eacute; certaines chancelleries occidentales. L'Allemagne,
les &Eacute;tats-Unis, le Japon et la Su&egrave;de ont adopt&eacute;
ou renforc&eacute; des mesures destin&eacute;es &agrave; limiter
l'aide aux pays trop gourmands d'armes. Mais leur port&eacute;e
est affaiblie par le comportement de certains &Eacute;tats occidentaux,
qui consacrent &agrave; l'armement un volume budg&eacute;taire
important. En outre, le principe de r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;penses
militaires se heurte aux traditionnelles ventes d'armes occidentales
dans le tiers monde et au soutien des budgets militaires du Sud
par l'aide &eacute;conomique.
<P>
La l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; des conditionnalit&eacute;s appara&icirc;t
en somme plus historique que juridique. Mais l'histoire m&ecirc;me
de ces principes souligne leur limite. Les efforts multilat&eacute;raux
se heurtent en effet &agrave; la persistance de strat&eacute;gies
diplomatiques particuli&egrave;res au sein du bloc occidental.
Les agences d'aide reproduisent ces diff&eacute;rences nationales,
d'o&ugrave; une application des normes de la conditionnalit&eacute;
et une gestion des relations avec les pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
au gr&eacute; des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts nationaux. Il reste enfin
&agrave; convaincre les &Eacute;tats en d&eacute;veloppement que
ces nouveaux principes n'entament pas plus leur souverainet&eacute;.
L'intervention ext&eacute;rieure risquerait autrement de cr&eacute;er
des changements artificiels, destin&eacute;s davantage aux donateurs
qu'aux soci&eacute;t&eacute;s locales.

<TR><TD>
Le Japon est le seul pays au monde dont la Constitution interdit
la d&eacute;tention de mat&eacute;riel militaire. Si son arm&eacute;e
s'est finalement d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e avec la b&eacute;n&eacute;diction
am&eacute;ricaine, l'opinion publique japonaise est rest&eacute;e
tr&egrave;s attach&eacute;e &agrave; ce principe et s'est toujours
oppos&eacute;e &agrave; ce qu'il soit modifi&eacute;. Depuis la
fin des ann&eacute;es 1970, des propositions de loi ont par trois
fois sugg&eacute;r&eacute; de lier formellement l'aide japonaise
et les d&eacute;penses militaires des &Eacute;tats b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
Finalement, en avril 1991, trois conditions ont &eacute;t&eacute;
pos&eacute;es &agrave; l'octroi de l'aide nippone : le niveau
des d&eacute;penses militaires, la production de moyens de destruction
de masse et la participation au commerce des armes.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR MULTINATIONAL

FORCE</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Members of the European Parliament on Wednesday 13

November approved of a resolution calling for the creation of

humanitarian corridors and the immediate set up of a multinational

force to ensure the safe passage of aid. The MEPS want an embargo

of arms exports to the region and a general disarmament of the

civilian population in the region.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Hory of the Radical party

stated that the mandate of the multinational force should not

allow it to strengthen the Zairian regime and protect its corrupt

army who are prone to pillaging and looting. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>EC Commissioner for Humanitarian Relief Emma Bonino

commended Europe on speaking with a single voice on the issue

stating, &quot;those preventing the sending of a force are on

the other side of the Atlantic.&quot; But she noted that without

a military force ,total unanimity could not save lives. According

to Mrs Bonino the multinational force should be given the mandate

to deliver basic goods protect the refugees and humanitarian material

and personnel, and facilitate the voluntary return of refugees.

On the urgency of the situation Mrs Bonino stated that &quot;If

a decision is not taken immediately, the force that will end up

on location will have nothing else to do bury the dead. .... And

what anger, frustration and shame we shall have to bear.&quot;

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The European Parliamentarians paid tribute to Mrs

Bonino's efforts to resolve the crisis while acknowledging that

the international community would have to bear some responsibility

for the crisis. Mrs Francisca Sauquilo a Spanish socialist wondered

why the EU was not using its capacity to act but rather trailing

the United States and Canada.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2.ACP EU REPRESENTATIVES ADOPT DECLARATION TO

REFORM DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION <BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>ACP and EU representatives last week adopted a final

declaration on the future of ACP-EU cooperation following their

20th annual meeting organised by the Economic and Social Committee.

The representatives recognised the need to adapt cooperation to

globalisation of the economy and to foster conditions for a new

sustainable convention that will ensure economic growth, prevent

crisis and upgrade the wellbeing of the populations. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The main principles proposed for the new Lom&eacute;

Convention after the year 200 are given below:</FONT>

<OL>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>The new convention aims to a) preserve the principles

of equality and the partnership of the lom&eacute; Convention;

b) promote good administration , human rights democracy and the

state of law; c) take in account the Maastricht Treaty on European

development policies, as well as the Uruguay round d) adopt a

more flexible approach to development cooperation reflecting the

different social and economic development of the ACP states. 

<BR>

</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>In order to reach theses aims the declaration

calls for an increase in the active participation of economic

and social partners<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. ANTI DISCRIMINATION CLAUSE IN THE TREATY IS

WRLCOMED<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Anti discrimination and anti-racist representatives

from organizations in EU Member states, Starting Line, welcomed

the &ccedil;&ccedil;&agrave;!&ccedil; last week with the Irish

prseidency in Dublin. Irish Minister for Equality, Mr. Mervyn

Taylor informed the meeting of the Presidents proposal to include

the anti-discrimination clause. The Starting Line representatives

recalled their own proposal backed by almost 300 Union organizations

as well as the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia,

Kahn Commission. The proposals will allow the EU to adopt legal

and other measures to by a qualified majority too early to determine

what kind of clause would be acceptable to all member states.</FONT>

<TITLE>The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=FFFFFF>
<a href="machel2cw.html"></a>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> 
The <A HREF="http://www.unicef.org/graca">Impact of Armed Conflict on Children</A> is the result of a
two-year process of research and consultation undertaken by Gra&ccedil;a Machel, the
Secretary-General's Expert on the subject and a former Minister for Education in Mozambique. 
<P>
Millions of children are caught up in conflicts in which they are not merely bystanders, but targets. Some
fall victim to a general onslaught against civilians; others die as part of a calculated genocide. Still other
children suffer the effects of sexual violence or the multiple deprivations of armed conflict that expose
them to hunger or disease. Just as shocking, thousands of young people are cynically exploited as
combatants.
<P>
The report says that in the past decade, around 2 million children have been killed in armed conflict, three
times as many have been seriously injured or permanently disabled, and countless others have been
forced to witness or even to take part in horrifying acts of violence.
<P>
As a result, says the report, children are being denied the protection promised them in the <A
HREF="http://www.unicef.org/crc">Convention on the Rights of the Child</A>. War violates every right of a
child &#151; the right to life, the right to be with family and community, the right to health, the right to
the development of the personality, and the right to be nurtured and protected.

The idea was raised , after successfully occupying a disused airfield the previous year,  to stage an urban occupation in the south-east. The Land Is Ours campaign were acting as a canopy for the occupation. Regular open meetings were being held for active people to get involved. A rough agenda was set and a short list of possible sites was narrowed down to one with two more sites situated nearby if that failed.  

<P>



May 5, was the beginning of the week long planned occupation where a sustainable eco-village with, gardens for growing food, yurts for kitchen and living spaces, compost toilets and roundhouse as a communal space were to be built. All of this following Agenda 21 that was set at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. All of this was to attract the media who would spread the land issues that we were raising to a wider audience. 

 <P>

Being early May there were plenty of activists floating about, with all of the on route evictions completed on the Newbury by-pass, and the Rainbow Centre cleaned out a few months before. In a convoy of coaches, tat lorries, living vehicles, cars and bikes we all set off from Hammersmith into the unknown. One coach was virtually full of eager media peoples all thinking they've got the prime scoop. Upon arrival, a  few of them slipped into the director's chair and tried unsuccessfully to give orders as if it was a soap opera. Brendans house

They had to be reminded that it was really happening! Within the first week a lot had been achieved, more than expected. The media loved it, the locals loved it, everybody loved it. Except of course the land owners Guinness and the Wandsworth Council. Situated in the heart of Tory territory, the eco-village was used as a slander match between the Tories and Labour councillors. Using it as a prop for their wider issues in their little games of power. The local community were generally supportive, and glad to see the land being used productively. Their support and involvement probably enabled us to stay the time we did. Guinness and the Wandsworth Council wanted us off from day 1. They didn't really need this sort of publicity on their doorstep. A much needed green space was provided for the locals to get actively involved. Kids being kids, couldn't keep away. The inquisitiveness drew them like a magnet. gradually their parents would dawdle over to investigate where their kids are spending so much time. And to satisfy their own curiosity, I'm sure. 

<P>

Summer holidays fast approached and the thought of the local kids from the battle-zones of the estates, terrorising the village became a reality. It was easy pickings for the thieves that swarmed us all summer. After a lot of compromising , people being banned, and finally violent clashes, the thieving became minor.

<P>

The makings of a mish mash community was in motion. Gardens lush with fresh vegetables appeared randomly across the site. The roundhouse stood grand with the kitchen always nearby, as a focal point of the site. Weekly meetings were held here to try and sort out, mainly domestic, issues arising on site. A lot of positive resolutions came of these as did insults, threats of violence until total disruption beyond any chance of continuing.

<P>

The kitchen was forever buzzing with vegetables being chopped , boxes of organic produce being dropped off from the local wholesalers. The fire was constantly dancing with the regular kettlewatchers sorting out the world's problem on their arses. For odd reasons the kitchen was constantly being altered, relocated until finally being  dismantled and a more permanent wooden structure was built over a weekend.

<P>

Dwellings constructed of all materials imaginable had sprung up out of nowhere. Some possibly even landing from above. Physically there was a village community catering for the basic needs of the people within. Obviously the heart of the community being the people which consisted of all walks of life.

<P>

The village could have been a condensed reflection of this consumerism society that we live. There were a lot of problems which were compassionately taken on board. There were times when the atmosphere was really calm and chilled out. Like a small festival in motion. Other times it was total mayhem with violence and drug abuse thriving. The space was there, as a gift from the gods in this urban jungle. People will perceive it how they want to, as we all live in our own reality. and Living vehicles pulled on and off constantly until a limit was set. I don't think there was ever a figure put on the limit. It was a case of pulling on and if a vehicle had recently pulled off then there must have been space. No-one was turned away and everybody was given the opportunity to involve themselves and be a part of the community. At one stage in the height of summer it was like a camping ground. People opting for a bit of fun, adventure or lazy days to escape from the tedious domestic life.

<P>

Every month or so there was an eviction scare, a tip-off from a source. Usually unknown. On one occasion it was the practical joke of a local kid ringing up saying that the troops were on their way to evict. People swallowed it and went into full panic stations. No questions were asked, not even as to who the caller was. It was all very entertaining to witness. Shortly afterwards all would be forgotten and people got on with what whatever they were doing. The threat of eviction loomed over our heads for nearly 3 months. The owners finally getting their full possession order from the High Court in early August. This didn't seem to deter people from getting on with their living, contributing here and there to the community. The security of our existence there was created by those who wanted to believe it to be. There was always from day 1, the one who would say ,'But you're going to be evicted anyway'. Attached to this was an attitude that would hinder people from trying to make things happen. This is true to an extent, an eviction is imminent. Time is always there and its precious. The more we could establish ourselves and gain positive recognition and support from the local community the greater our chances of staying longer. This was a viewpoint adopted by many.

<P>

For whatever reasons the sheriff decided to evict, I`II probably never know. The signs were telling and in your face to see. For whatever we were trying to achieve on site it probably never looked that way towards the end of summer. Our local Support was dwindling and complaints arising. The local kids became extinct on site, parents worried about their safety among the violence and drug abuse.

<P>

Concrete tip-offs were flustering in from all sources. Instinctively I knew that this was the one. It all seemed plausible at that moment. It was a short lived dream that was swamped with the problems that society won't deal with or fail to recognise. This burden became too great and the final straw was placed to break the camel's back.

<P>

Guinness with all their cronies had planned a finely executed invasion from all directions. Evicting everyone in a few hours and by the end of the day they had transformed a thriving community , surrounded by lush wildlife, into churned up soil and mounds of debris where the houses and other structures once stood. Later this was turned into sawdust until not even a blade of grass existed. An alarmed fence was erected complete with razor wire to simulate a prison camp.

<P>

Living there, I don't really know what kind of an impact it had on people, our initial aim was to highlight the failure of the current planning system has on peoples access to common land and their exclusion from the decision making  in the planning process. For all it's madness, the village infested itself into people's own dreams. People were healed and healing others. It was like a huge adventure playground for little and big kids, with no rules. A place where people could be and allowed to have fun.

It centres on a beach divine, a self-proclaimed 'prophet by birth and by inclination', who fleeces his 'customers I mean worshippers well, customers, if you like' by playing on their gullibility. Brother Jero is a vicious little man, a liar and a sneak, forever manipulating those around him. But Brother Jero has a weakness: the 'Daughters of Discord', one of whom is currently tormenting him: 'Goes to swim over there and then waits for me to be in the midst of my meditation before she swings her hips across here, flaunting her near-nakedness before my eyes...' He tries it on with her before the day is out and gets a hiding for his pains, but he's presently confronted with a more pressing problem, which is how to get his assistant certified insane in order to evade the relatively insignifant debt he owes the poor man's wife. He succeeds, 'And so the day is saved'.<p>How much of contemporary Nigeria are we to read into this play? Or, rather, how much does the Federal Military Government of General Sani Abacha want us to read into it? On 27 February, a scheduled performance of The Trials of Brother Jero at the National Theatre in Lagos was suddenly cancelled owing to 'a technical fault' even as the audience queued outside. The following day, Fezi Productions, the company concerned, attempted to stage the play at a local secondary school. This time they were visited by members of the State Security Service (SSS), who proceeded to arrest the director, Israel Eboh, the technical director, Albert Odulate, and a third person, Richard Bruce. All three were taken to the SSS headquarters, put in seperate rooms, and asked to write statements about any other Soyinka play they had performed. Additionally, Israel Eboh was (in his own words) 'told to sign an undertaking stopping the show', before they were released. The irony in all of this, and the reason for staging this particular Soyinka play, is that The Trials of Brother Jero also happens to be a set-text in secondary schools throughout the country, which would seem to put the authorities in something of a quandary.<p>On the other hand, it might not have mattered much which of Soyinka's plays was being performed. 'Wanted Dead or Alive: The Junta Guns for Soyinka' was the cover story of a recent issue of Tell (5 March), the weekly magazine of no fixed abode since last Christmas when its editor, Nosa Igiebor, was taken into custody, where he currently remains. Soyinka himself, who has vowed to 'cripple this administration', even to the extent of temporarily abandoning literature, said in a recent interview that he was one of three Nigerians that the government is 'terrified' of. The other two Chief Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the annulled elections, and Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, a retired general of considerable political ambition are currently in detention, the one for treason, the other for supposedly planning a coup. According to the article in Tell, Soyinka might by now have been executed (as Yar'Adua so nearly was) but for his timely flight into exile. Writers are judicially murdered in Nigeria, as we all discovered when Ken Saro-Wiwa and his fellow Ogoni activists were hanged last November following a rigged trial.<p>The government, for its part, has openly accused the country's only Nobel laureate of being behind two unexplained bomb blasts and the crash of a presidential jet in which General Abacha's eldest son was killed: 'His utterances that he will cripple this government is a matter to be taken seriously, so people should talk to him. Those who know what triggered off the civil war in Nigeria (in the late sixties) will know that what Soyinka is presently doing was exactly a replica of what triggered off the civil war.' Thus the ever-garrulous Minister for Special Duties, Alhaji Wada Nas, in an interview he gave The Guardian newspaper (30 January) in the wake of the three incidents. As Soyinka himself retorted on the BBC: 'I think this regime has actually reached the stage of acute dementia. It's entire propaganda service has gone Goebbelsian.' <p>And that, after all, is the whole point about this government, in power now for just over two years. Lacking credibility either at home or abroad, it functions only as government-by-propaganda, which is why the economy is going to hell. At every turn the government tries to convince us that it seized power in order to save us from a fate worse than death, and at every turn Soyinka, with his unrivalled access to the hated Western Media and its 'orchestrated campaign of calumny' (to quote the even more garrulous Dr Walter Ofonagoro, the Minister for Information and Culture), pours scorn on a dictator who, 'totally lacking in vision', is 'prepared to reduce Nigeria to rubble as long as he survives to preside over a name...'<p> Brother Jero, in Soyinka's play, lives to fight another day; but: 'Ingrate! Monster! I curse you with the curse of the Daughters of Discord. May they be your downfall. May the Daughters of Eve bring down ruin on your head!' Thus his former mentor, whose land he stole in order to set up in business, and whose words continue to rankle, spoiling everything. It seems that Abacha, the man of war, is not so visionless that he doesn't understand the power of the word.<p><hr>©Copyright: Index on Censorship<hr><p><b>Send us your views</b><a href="mailto:indexoncenso@gn.apc.org"><img border=0 src="index_pix/red_button1.gif"></a><p><TABLE BORDER=6><TR><TD><a href="index.html">Back to INDEX Home Page</a></TD></TR></TABLE><hr></body></html>

<B>1. ACP/EU JOINT ASSEMBLY PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR LOME CONVENTION

AFTER THE YEAR 2000</B>

<P>

<B> </B>The ACP/EU Joint Assembly on Tuesday 1 October invited

 EU and ACP political leaders to launch a broad public debate

on the future of co-operation between the ACP and the EU after

the year 2000. A report by the Joint Assembly's rapporteur on

the subject, Mr. Firmin Jean-Louis, described the continuation

of co-operation between the EU and ACP (with some necessary adjustments)

after the Lom&eacute; IV expires in the year 2000 as vital. This

is due to the past Lom&eacute; Conventions' successful contribution

to the North-South dialogue. 

<P>

 Among the issues that should be considered in the debate are

the specific natures and particularities of the various ACP countries,

the involvement of non-governmental bodies in financial and technical

co-operation, the encouragement of regional co-operation amongst

the ACP countries and the fostering of private initiative in the

development process. 

<P>

 Mr. Firmin Jean Louis earlier noted that ACP-EU co-operation

had so far not resulted in great improvements of the socio-economic

situation in most ACP countries. 38 ACP countries are still listed

among the 47 poorest countries in the world. He called for increased

partnership between government, civil society and local organisations.



<P>

 Mr. Richard Cheltenham, a Barbados representative, voiced his

hope that the Lom&eacute; Convention facilities STABEX and SYSMIN

will be maintained, stating that the Convention should not be

revised downwards. Mr. Francis Wurtz, a French representative,

 called for aid to be focused on self-sufficiency in food, technological

transfers for processing raw materials and development in infrastructure

that will foster development. He urged the EU and its Member States

to work towards the cancellation of the ACP debt. He also stated

that the European public should be made aware that lasting growth

in Europe is dependent on development in Third World countries.



<P>

<B>2. DISPARITY BETWEEN EUROPE'S TOP DECISION MAKERS AND THE GENERAL

PUBLIC IN THEIR OPINION OF THE EU</B>

<P>

<B> </B>A  first-time survey of Europe's top decision makers carried

out by <U>Eurobarometer</U> has revealed a great difference between

how decision makers and the general public view the EU. 94% of

the decision makers defined as elected politicians, high level

civil servants, business and labour leaders, the media, academics

and religious and cultural leaders consider EU membership as advantageous.

The strongest support for the EU among decision makers was found

in Germany (98%) and the weakest in Sweden (84%). Amongst the

general public the EU's strongest support was in Ireland, Italy

and the Netherlands (75%) and weakest in Austria and Sweden with

27% and 29% respectively. 

<P>

 Decision makers and the general public also differed on what

they considered priority issues in the coming years, with the

former stating the establishment and maintenance of peace as the

main priority followed by fighting unemployment, while the general

public considered fighting unemployment over the maintenance of

peace as the top priority. On the issue of a single currency,

85% of  decision makers are pro monetary union while only 53%

of the general public want a single currency.

<P>

<B>3. ACP/EU JOINT ASSEMBLY CALLS FOR COMMUNITY POLICY ON IMMIGRATION</B>

<P>

 The ACP/EU Joint Assembly on Monday 30 September condemned immigrant

policy that puts an emphasis on xenophobia and the mistrust of

foreigners. The Joint Assembly urged the European Community to

establish a common immigrant policy recognising basic rights to

housing, freedom of speech, freedom of association, reuniting

of families, education and protection against discrimination and

arbitrary deportation. 

<P>

 The Assembly called on the Union and its Member States to increase

aid to ACP states and create a healthy environment that would

discourage migration from the ACP countries to Europe. It also

urged ACP and EU Member States to introduce harsher penalties

for all those who exploit immigrants and take advantage of  their

precarious situation. 

<P>

<B>4. EU HUMANITARIAN COMMISSIONER ATTACKS SILENCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS

VIOLENCE IN AFGHANISTAN</B>

<P>

 Emma Bonino, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid,

has attacked the silence from the UN, the USA and some EU Member

States such as Sweden on the violation of human rights and restriction

of the rights of women in Afghanistan after the Talibans seized

power. On Wednesday, 2 October she appealed to the EU and the

UN to react on the matter and described the issue as one of western

hypocrisy. Mrs Bonino stated &quot;if such a situation occurred

in Sudan or Iran, the reaction would be different&quot;. She added,

&quot; When a situation of violation of human rights continues,

there is a major risk that this will result in humanitarian crisis,

together with a political crisis&quot;. 

<P>

 Last July the Commission approved of a 7 million ECU aid package

for public health projects, mine clearance and for financing of

part of the World Food Programme in Afghanistan. Mrs. Bonino expressing

her concern a bout distribution of this package, stated that &quot;Since

11 September, not a single convoy has been able to get through

to Kabul&quot;. 

<P>

 

<P>

<B>5. WESTERN SAHARAN REFUGEES TO RECEIVE 6.5 MILLION ECU FROM

EU </B>

<P>

<B> </B>The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO has granted

an aid package of 6.5 million ECU to the Western Saharan, refugees

in Algeria. The aid will assist some 150 000 people displaced

by the fighting between the Polisario Front and the Moroccan army.

The greater part of the package will be used to finance food,

and medical aid (5 million ECU). The rest will go towards the

repair of public buildings destroyed in recent floods.

<center><h1>Whose Future?</h1></center>



<font size=+1><i>The future isn't what it used to be', a wit once observed. <b>Vanessa Baird</b> takes a critical look at what 'the future' is becoming.</i></font><p>
<hr>
<p>


Five minutes to four. A bit ahead of myself. Time to kill. Check the door. No 70. Look out for tell-tale signs. A small totemic figure hanging from the doorbell. Seems promising. Feeling nervous. <br>
She leads me into her consulting room, apologizing for the smell.'My last client was a chain-smoker.' I'm overwhelmed not by the smell of smoke but of incense. 
'I don't go up as far as 2025,' she had told me on the phone. Never mind. It's the process of looking into the future - or futurism - that I'm interested in. My motives are initially journalistic. <p>
<font size=-1>Picture: Today's actions, tomorrows world.  Looking ahead helps to see the damage we are doing now.</font><p>

Anna Sandham, Tarot reader and astrologer, lays out four cards, each dealing with a general area: Spirit, Law, Earthly Matters, Romance. I choose the card relating to the area I wish to explore. I surprise myself by choosing'Spirit'. She lays the rest of the cards face-down in an arc before me and tells me to pick 13.
When I have picked them and
handed them to her she takes the first card, lays it down and interprets it.<p>




I know it is easy to find connections if you are looking for them  - but one after another the interpretations are uncannily resonant for me. After a while I realize that although I've come to have my future told only some of the cards actually relate to the future. Some relate to the past but most relate to very personal things that are submerged in the present. 
This, she explains, is because we are working largely in the realm of the unconscious. It is this that will affect the future. Afterwards I realize that a simple future projection would have been quite meaningless; that the'future' cards make sense only in the context of the'past' and the'present' cards. To separate past, present and future doesn't feel relevant or meaningful. <p>

Later I read something by W Warren Wagar, the New York State University historian and futurist. He puts it in a different way:'Standing in the middle of a river looking upstream one sees the past. Standing in the middle of the river gazing downstream one sees the future. But it is always the same river.'<font size=-1><b>1</b></font><p>

<h3>Crossing boundaries </h3>
Twentieth-century physics is also telling us that rigid past, present and future divisions are not as real or useful as our timepieces suggest.  
Before Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity in 1915 space and time were thought to be fixed. Einstein's theory got rid of this idea and showed that space and time were dynamic.<font size=-1><b>2</b></font><p>

Although this radical insight shook up the Western scientific world, it would not have been so strange to many people less thoroughly conditioned by modern scientific rationalism. Within traditional cultures there is a regular crossing of time boundaries. A peasant woman in the Peruvian Andes will talk freely and easily about hearing <i>los ancianos </i>- the spirits of the past who inhabit the mountains - advising her on what to do in the future. Spirits are notoriously disrespectful of time-boundaries - and if spirits are part of your daily conceptual framework you probably have less regard for those boundaries too.
Within these traditions there is nothing weird or wacky about trying to see into the future: it is simply another way of reaching the gods. Whether reading the entrails of a sacrificial animals in Ethiopia or visiting a voodoo priest in Haiti, the attempt to divine the future is usually for moral and spiritual guidance. <p>

In more secular societies ruminating on the future has usually been driven by intellectual curiosity and playfulness. It has been especially fertile ground for writers, whose works have ranged from fictional ideal worlds - or utopias - to popular Sci-Fi. The former enabled thinkers like Thomas More or William Morris to criticize obliquely their own societies while suggesting alternatives. Such imaginative, fictional approaches to the future have proved to be about as reliable - or unreliable - as more plodding 'probable' scenarios. In fact, that's one reason we chose to ask eight fiction writers to help us look at the world in the year 2025 in this issue of the NI.<p>

But in recent years looking into the future has become more serious - 'factual', philosophical and commercial. Eager to gain academic recognition, those who study the future now argue that their subject has its place alongside others like history or geology. In their own defence futurists claim to study alternative futures just as historians study alternative pasts.<p>


<h3>Beware, beware </h3> 
It sounds fair enough, but prophecy - like history - is powerful stuff. Facts can be manipulated easily enough in the present to constitute lies. With the future the prophet has an even freer hand. <p>




Even George Orwell, creator of that most famous futuristic dystopia or 'reverse utopia' 1984, came to the conclusion that futurism pandered to fear and cravings for power.<font size=-1><b>3</b></font> <p>

This rings particularly true in a century that has seen charismatic leaders such as Hitler, Mussolini and Haiti's Papa Doc Duvalier propagating their version of the future. The fascist leader needs to create a convincing vision to mobilize people to do things they might otherwise find morally repugnant. The end has to be convincingly conjured to justify the means - even if it involves genocide. If a particular group of people are the problem, the source of fear and insecurity, they must be removed. Once people have escaped into the easy solution they can be easily dominated by it - as in Rwanda and the former Yugoslav republics today.<p>

Historian and futurist, Warren Wagar concedes: 'Virtually all totalitarian regimes of our century have been informed by a past-centred or future-centred ideology that tells their hapless subjects precisely what the past ordains or what the future demands.' <p>

This happens, he says, when people take a'too rigid view of time, imagining they know more than they do'. They end up'devaluing present life and happiness in the name of some imagined past or future felicity'.<font size=-1><b>1</b></font>   It is a bit reminiscent of the Queen of Hearts' comment in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> :'The rule is jam tomorrow, jam yesterday - but never jam today.'<p>

Fascism is not the only political force to conjure future visions in a manipulative way. Max Dublin, who has become one of the fiercest critics of futurism since working as a strategic planning consultant to the Canadian Government, states:'Prophecy is a basic tool of ideology, Left or Right, East or West.'<font size=-1><b>4</b></font><p>

The USSR preached that communism would lead to a glorious future of a classless, egalitarian society - with plenty of promised jam. The US pointed to a different future of repeated conflict with the'evil empire' in order to stoke up Cold War fever and justify feeding its rapacious
military-industrial complex. A favoured activity of Cold War planners was to work on imagined'wargames' which explored options for'contained' nuclear war.<p>

<h3>Whose business? </h3>
Today the Future is a booming business, especially in North America and Japan. With the millennium around the corner think-tanks, research groups and consultants are peddling their prophecies hard and fast to planners and policy-makers. Many claim their methods are'scientific' and they rely heavily on computer projections. And more and more policy-makers are using their work. <p>

Dutch futurists Henk Becker and Joseph van Doorn observe that today:'A policy-maker either uses the results of a futures research project to beat his [sic] opponents or his opponents attack him by using futures research and he needs to have this kind of research available to hit back.'<p>

The title of a recent futurist conference in Toronto says it all: <i>Getting to the future first!</i> Newt Gingrich, right-wing Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives takes such things to heart. He has hand-picked the US's most famous pop-futurist Alvin Toffler as a close adviser. Toffler's ideas are useful to Gingrich - especially the idea that there is going to be a great radical leap into a'Third Wave' and this will involve dismantling a great part of government. Gingrich interprets this to justify his own hostility to state intervention in the economy and to welfare safety nets for the poor.<p>

This alliance of politics and prophecy is nothing new. In the first century BC the Roman Senate would not make a move without consulting the book of the Sibyl, a famous collection of prophecies made by an inspired woman. Today, reports churned out by futurists serve the same function. Unfortunately, they are not churned out by inspired women - or inspired men for that matter. Instead they are produced by Western technocrats (mostly white and male) using state-of-the-art computer technology. Despite these sophisticated machines, Michael Marien, US editor of <i>Futures Survey</i>, thinks the quality of futures study has actually declined in the past 20 years. And computer projections, he says, have not helped.'You have to start off with an assumption and if that is wrong then the whole thing will be wrong.'<p>

Most commercial futures research assumes that competition and domination will go on being the way the world is ordered. Tacit assumptions are made based on things remaining as they are - only'more so' in whatever direction the trend is stretched. The effect is not to broaden horizons but actually to narrow down options.<p>

The fact is that these prophecies say a lot more about who has produced them than about any likely future. You can see how this works by looking at future projections from the last century when there was a firm belief that hot-air balloons were to be the transport technology of the twentieth century. Many of our current obsessions with'virtual reality' may prove to be as inappropriate and risible to future generations.<p>

<h3>Reclaiming the future </h3>
So does that mean that trying to glimpse the future is a waste of time - and a dangerous one at that? <p>

If it means passively following the technology fads and self-interested forecasts of big business and its political allies, then yes. But it need not be that. Looking ahead can sometimes help us to think more clearly and imaginatively. It can shed light on the present and help us make the changes now that will affect the future. <p>

Teacher Noel Wilson works with teenagers in Australia and the UK and gets them to depict what they think the 


world will be like in 30 years. After collecting examples from 600 students he was able to see a clear pattern emerging. Over half of the drawings showed computers and robots in block houses, skyscrapers and domes. Most revealed landscapes of bleak devast-ation. Nearly all were negative and dehumanised. Most had no human presence at all.<font size=-1><b>5</b></font><p>

What's so worrying about this sense of hopelessness - which other teachers and researchers confirm is the norm - is that it produces passivity and a sense of fatality. The despair itself becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
Joanna Macy addresses this in workshops and in her book <i>Despair and Personal Power in the Nuclear Age. </i>For a start, she teaches that feelings of pain for our world are natural and healthy and only morbid if denied. Information alone, she says, is not enough and unlocking repressed feelings can release energy and clear the mind. Unblocking pain for the world, she concludes, reconnects us with a larger web of life.
This is all good therapeutic stuff. In imagining the future we can get in touch with our deepest fears and desires. Then the positive work of imagining alternative scenarios and thinking about how they might be achieved can begin.<p>

In another project, when 400 young people from different backgrounds and from different continents focused on how they would like the world to be, two images kept recurring in their utopias. One was'boundarylessness' - a free flow of people, thought and activities unimpeded by occupational or political or national barriers. The other was of a'bright, clean green world with clear blue oceans'.<b>5 </b>
If there is one area where changes we make now <i>will</i> affect the future it is in our relationship to the environment. Because environmental damage is happening gradually it's possible to ignore it. But if we ask ourselves what will happen if current trends are not reversed - holes in the ozone layer, global warming, water pollution and the accumulation of toxic and nuclear waste - then things look grim indeed. Unless you believe that technology or'market forces' will get us out of this mess (not a wise bet), then there is no choice but to start taking the environment seriously. 
Unlike most catastrophes in the making, the eventual collapse of the environment is one we can safely predict - before the suffering actually hits. But can we learn to act now for the future?  <p>

David Hicks, Director of the Global Futures Project at Bath College of Higher Education in England, is making a start. He gets his students to imagine what'sustainability' would look like in the North, in the South and globally. And then he challenges them to think about what needs to be done to achieve it.<p>

And there are lots of possibilities. We can start the move from fossil fuels and nuclear power to safe renewable sources of energy like solar or wind power. We can introduce an environmental cost in our economic calculations. We can start moving to a philosophy of sustainability as opposed to lemming-like economic growth at whatever cost to the environment. We can adopt an approach of responsibility and stewardship towards our planet rather than exploitation. <p>

This may seem like pie-in-the-sky. After all, since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 most governments have shown that their actual - though unprofessed - commitment is to keeping things as they are.<br>
And the futures research that politicians and corporations choose to use is unlikely to tell them to stop what they are doing and think about the earth. A report called <i>The Highly Probable Future: 83 assumptions about the year 2025</i>, sponsored by 18 American and European multinationals, is typically woolly on the subject of the environment. The report concludes:'Global environmental management issues will be institutionalized in multinational corpor-ations as well as through the United Nations and other supranational entities.' It goes on to assert:'The multinational corporation will be the world's dominant business form.'<font size=-1><b>6</b></font><p>

This is not the future that many of the world's peoples want or are prepared to have decided for them. Resistance is growing everywhere. Environmental activists from Bangladesh to Brazil, from Kenya to Canada are challenging governments and corporations and gaining increasing popular support. When the Nigerian Government recently turned its guns against its own Ogoni people to make way for petroleum drilling by the Anglo-Dutch multinational Shell Oil, international protest was quickly mobilized by activists using global e-mail and other networks. And the scale of recent anti-road-building protests in Britain has taken everyone by surprise. More and more people around the globe are recognizing that we cannot 'tinker' - or build - our way out of the problems we have created for ourselves and future generations  Our relationship with the planet will need to change radically. <p>

It's now just five years to the turn of the century and a new millennium, traditionally a time of great upheaval. Astrologers are gearing up for it. The planets will be lined up in Taurus (a powerful Earth sign) in the year 2000. According to Anna, my Tarot-reader, it could mean two things: either we will embark on a new way of relating to the earth; or we will obstinately cling to our old ways. Which is it to be? <p>

The kind of world we will have in a few decades depends on our capacity to start making big changes now. In this sense, the future is present.<p>

<html><head><title>Gold Mining Press Release</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="panos_info.html"> Panos </i> </a><hr> <table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td align="right">Panos Press Release May 1996</td></tr><tr><td>
<h2>Gold Mining - weighing up the costs</h2></td></tr></table> 




As demand for gold hits an all-time high, more and more cash-strapped countries are opening their doors to gold-mining interests. A new report published by the Panos Institute examines whether the increased demand for gold can benefit the development of Third World countries. <p> 

The Panos report - <b><a href="brief19.html">The Lure of Gold: how golden is the future?</a></b> - highlights the need for tight economic and environmental measures if developing countries are to benefit from gold-mining. It warns that <i>"without new safeguards the lustre of gold may well turn out to be as illusory for developing countries as the fabled El Dorado."</i><p> 

More than 70 countries - 31 in Africa - have now changed their mining laws to attract foreign investment, many offering a host of incentives, including reduced taxes and the lifting of foreign ownership restrictions. With international creditors banging at their doors, the appeal of boosted production and export earnings can be strong. On the ground mining creates jobs for the under-employed and unemployed and can help develop infrastructure.<p> 

<i>"The problem is that the economic rewards of mining - jobs, schools, roads and power plants - are often outweighed by other costs. One important step would be to develop mining policies which ensure a fair share of profits go to local communities, as well as protecting the environment and miners" </i>says Nigel Cross, executive director of the Panos Institute.<p> 

Demand for gold is higher than ever before - 3,642 tonnes in 1995 as against the previous record of 3,573 tonnes in 1992. Transnational corporations and an aggressive new breed of 'junior' mining companies are now rushing to stake their claims to gold in new territories such as Ecuador, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Laos and Central Asia.<p>


Predictions are that in 20 years about half of global production will come from territories used or claimed by Indigenous Peoples.<p> 

Most forms of gold-mining can have severe environmental and health costs - caused, for instance, by the use of cyanide and mercury in the gold-production process. Each year 80-100 tonnes of mercury is discharged into the Amazonian river system. Blood tests on the Kayap&oacute people show that 25% have high levels of mercury.<p>

Worldwide around 10% of gold is now derived from small-scale mining, and it is estimated that this sector now produces up to 20% of Africa's gold. But although the proceeds could be invested in local communities, the fact that the industry is largely illegal and unregulated means that most earnings leave the country. The use and development of non-polluting technologies, as well as training and government backing, are badly needed to support the small-scale sector.<p> 

<b>Notes to editors:</b><p>

For further information contact Juliet Heller or Shelina Thawer, on Tel 0171 278 1111. Roger Moody, author of the Panos report report, is available for interviews.<p>

The 20-page report, <b><i>The Lure of Gold: how golden is the future?</b></i> is available from the Panos Institute. Price: 5.00 including p&p.<p> 

The Panos Institute is an independent non-profit organisation working for sustainable development.<p>

<center><h1>WOMEN OF THE WORLD</h1></center>
<h3>Films for the Fourth World Conference on Women:  Beijing, September 5-13 1995</h3>


The Fourth World Conference on Women, being held by the United Nations in Beijing this September, is a chance for the world to take stock of just what women have achieved in the last 10 years  - and just how far, in all too many areas, they still have to go.
<p>

As just some examples, women work twice as many hours as men - but earn only one per cent of the world's wealth. Of the one billion adults in the world who can't read or write, two thirds are women. And eighty per cent of all refugees are women, or the children who depend on them.
<p>


TVE is offering a wide-ranging package of films - the majority made by Southern women directors - for broadcast in September to coincide with, and to raise awareness of, the Beijing Conference. These unique programmes focus on women's lives around the world, in all their colour and diversity: from the turbulent history of women's lives in China over the last 50 years - told through the story of four generations of women in one family - to a moving account of Guatemala's 45,000 war widows who are no longer prepared to live their lives invisibly; from a chilling investigation of the widespread sterilization of women in Brazil, and the culture that forbids them more humane methods of family planning, to the triumpant tale of women in India who are confronting the demons of 'arak' - the local village alcohol - as a result of education and literacy classes. <p>

 <center></center><p>



<h2>The WOMEN OF THE WORLD Programmes</h2>

The programmes available in the <b>Women of the World</b> series fall into the categories set out below. TVE holds all the rights to this package of programmes so if you are interested in purchasing them for broadcast or non-broadcast use please contact TVE's Distribution Office to request an order form.
<p>

Electronic Mail: <a href="mailto:tve-dist@tve.org.uk">tve-dist@tve.org.uk</a></b>

<p>

<b>Women's Hour - </b>five 52 minute documentaries, made by women directors from the developing world - China, Vietnam, Palestine, India, Nigeria, and Brazil - and presenting audiences around the world with their own, unique perspective on gender;<p>


<b>Short Stories - </b>a series of six 10 minute news features on background issues on the Beijing agenda, also made by women directors, with an introduction from Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme;
<p>

<b>Beijing Features - </b>four 20-30 minute short documentaries and a series of five minute films from around the world on issues on the Beijing agenda;
<p>

<b>Beijing 'Spots' - </b>a series of 21 one-minute public service announcements, or 'spots' - on the status and condition of women worldwide.  



<h2>WOMAN'S HOUR  <font size=-1>5 x 52' documentaries</font></h2>			

<b>HALF THE SKY </b>is a timely exploration of the dramatic changes within the lives of four generations of women in the Xie family over the last 50 years in China - an appropriate subject for a film set in the country that is hosting the Beijing conference. Produced by Chinese director Sun Shuyun for  the UK's Channel Four, this 52 minute film takes its title from Chairman Mao Zedong's dictum that 'women are half the sky -  and absolutely the equal of men'.
<p>

<b>HANAN ASHRAWI - A WOMAN OF HER TIME </b>is an intimate portrait of the woman who played a key role in negotiating the Palestinian/Israeli peace accord. Directed and produced by award-winning Palestinian director Mai Masri, the film explores Hanan Ashrawi's early family life, her first encounters with the PLO, and her struggle to reconcile the demands of her public persona with her role as wife and mother - in a region where democracy has so far had little impact on the status of women.
<p>

<b>RISING ABOVE - WOMEN OF VIETNAM </b>is an exploration of the dynamics of sexual politics in Vietnam, directed by Lebanese filmmaker Heiny Srour, with Vietnamese associate producer Thu Ngyen. Women fought alongside men as equals in the Vietnam war; now the revival of Confucianism and the spread of market forces are conspiring to relegate them once again to the role of second class citizens.
<p>

<b>THE PREFERRED SEX ... THE DESIRED NUMBER </b>is a provocative documentary that provides a candid insight into women's reproductive health and status in Nigeria and India. Produced by Daniel Riesenfeld, the documentary is made up of two stories: Nigerian director Ngozi Onwurah examines the tradition in Nigeria of honouring a woman's ability to bear more than ten children, while Indian director Manjira Datta investigates the preference for male babies in India, and the tragic case of Lali Devi who poisoned herself and two of her girl children because she could not conceive a boy.
<p><center></center><p>



<b>LIBERATION (VENTRE LIBRE) </b>deals with issues of reproductive rights, illegal abortion and the promotion of sterilization as a family planning method for even teenage girls in Brazil - a country with the highest rate of unsafe abortions in the world. Brazilian director Ana Luiza Azevedo has a made a graphic film which tells the intimate stories of women who - with no access to safe family planning services - risk their lives and health to avoid having more children.

<a name="short"></a>
<h2>SHORT STORIES  <font size=-1>6 x 10' documentaries</font></h2>			

Introduced by UNEP's Executive Director, Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, these features focus on some of the <i>Critical Areas of Concern on the Platform for Action </i>due to be agreed in Beijing. They look at problems of domestic violence and substance abuse in the Caribbean; women's empowerment through an innovative fish farming project in Fiji; a women's literacy programme in Andrah Pradesh, India, which inspired a state-wide anti-liquor campaign; women as victims of militarization in Guatemala, where there are 45,000 war widows; women negotiating for their own health care provision in the new democracy of South Africa; and women caught up in the global drug trade in Hong Kong.

<ul><b>A Little Learning Goes a Long Way</b><br>
Napur Basu's film looks at rural women in the state of Andra Pradesh who first got together when they enrolled on a national literacy programme - and are now waging a state-wide campaign against the sellers of  'arak'- the local alcohol.
<p>

<b>Domestic Violence in the Caribbean</b><br>
Domestic violence in the Caribbean is on the increase and women - as both carers, and the victims themselves of violence - are at the centre of the struggle to combat the problem. Judith Laird's film uses drama and 'rap' music to show how Caribbean women are  challenging the problem head on.
<p>

<b>A Healthy Start</b><br>
South African society is undergoing momentous changes - amongst these, the debate over a new national health policy. Sandra Herrington's film follows a group of women fighting to ensure that their needs and experience were included in the decision-making process.
<p>

<b>Teach a Woman How To Fish and...</b><br>
In the overpopulated island of Fiji, women have long ensured their survival by subsistence fishing, involving long hours of work in precarious conditions. Amelia Simmons' film shows that a new initiative ensuring a greater role for women in the decision-making process has had a profound affect on their lives both in the waters and out!
<p></ul>
<center></center>


<ul>
<b>Footprints of Sorrow:  Widows of Guatemala</b><br>
In Guatemala there are 45,000 widows - mostly uneducated women who have lost their husbands as a result of decades of political violence. Claudia Acedevo's stirring film shows that the women are now fighting back, demanding that their rights as indigenous women be recognized and that human rights violations be brought to an end.
<p>

<b>Migrant Workers in Hong Kong</b><br>
In the 1990s over three million workers - mostly women -  left the Philippines to go and work as migrant workers in the Middle East, Singapore and Hong Kong. Anastasia Edwards' film looks at the lives of the Filipino 'amahs' who have decided to take the plunge and find work in the financial mecca of Hong Kong.
</ul>

<h2>BEIJING FEATURES</h2>		


<ul><b>Little by Little </b>(25 minutes) focuses on reproductive health as the key factor in both the empowerment of women and in sustainable development. In Ghana, Nepal and Bolivia, director Chris Walker's films shows women taking small but crucial steps to improve their lives and their health. 
<p>

<b>Almost Like Fire</b> (20 minutes) traces a journey home to the Philippines by development worker Fely Villareal. On the island of Cabugao she finds how women have revolutionised their lives by breaking cultural traditions and setting up their own fishing enterprises.  'In the past my symbol for this island was women crying quietly at night, but now they are free.' Other encounters are less encouraging with women from the overcrowded slums speaking about the constant threat of domestic violence. 
<p>

<b>Rites of Passage: Four Stories of Survival</b> (24 minutes) follows four teenage girls as they come of age and traces the personal cost of this transition. In Nicaragua, Aleyda is addicted to glue-sniffing and is slipping into a life of prostitution; in India, Tarranum has been taken out of school to be married off; in Jamaica, Natalyn is 14 years old and seven months pregnant, and in Burkina Faso Adjara faces the prospect of female genital mutilation - seen by local women as essential if a woman is to enter married life.
<p>

<b>Science for Survival</b> (50 minutes) is set in India and investigates rural women's knowledge of traditional crop seed varieties. Spearheaded by ecologist and ex-nuclear physicist-turned-activist Vandana Shiva, a people's movement in India has grown up in opposition to what it regards as 'reductionist' Western science. The film explores Vandana Shiva's ideas that putting 'the feminist principle' back into science will give poor countries back control over their own destinies.</ul>
<p><ul></center>
<br clear=all></ul><br> <p>


<ul>

<b>5-Minute Project </b>(10 x 5 minutes) was born from Women Empowering Communication, a conference which took place in Bangkok in 1994, where producers made initial commitments to prepare stories. Women from over 20 countries are participating in this global video project and the end result will be a video anthology that covers the issues most important to them. They will represent their points of view in five-minute segments - both documentaries and dramas. Other videos show how women gain confidence and raise their self-esteem by learning to value the work they do - often in innovative ways.
</ul>

 <h2>BEIJING SPOTS  <font size=-1>21 x 1' spots</font></h2>				

From the provocative and stylish opening graphics - accompanied by a saucy wolf-whistle - to the final title announcing the Beijing conference, these 'spots' offer a snapshot of gender, power and ownership in 1995 - five years before women were promised equality.

<p>The ACP/EU Joint Assembly, co-chaired by the UK Conservative Lord Plumb and Sir John Kaputin (Papua New Guinea), will open its autumn session in Luxembourg 23 September.</p>

<p>Between 23 and 27 September, MEPs and their colleagues of ACP States will discuss the reports by Jean-Louis Firmin (Haiti) on the future relations between EU and ACP countries, the situation in specific countries (Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, Sudan, Somalia and Western Sahara), the development of relations between the EU and South Africa, the results of the Conference on the information society, the very controversial EU draft directive on cocoa and its consequences for producer countries among ACPs and the EU regulation on bananas.</p>

<p>A hearing will take place on Wednesday 25 September on Climate Change and Small Island Countries. </p>

<p><b>2.	IGC/AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</b></p>

<p>According to Amnesty International, the IGC should provide the opportunity to place the respect for and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the heart of legal basis of the Union. Rather than making new declarations, it should ensure that the existing ones are put into practice through providing new instruments with the European Union framework. AI makes four concrete recommendations:</p>

<OL>

<LI>The IGC should introduce a human rights impact assessment for all important decisions under Common Foreign and Security Policy.<P>

<LI>The Member States should undertake to fully respect international instruments such as the Conclusions of the UNHCR Executive Committee and the Handbook of the UNHCR on Procedures and Criteria for determining Refugee Status.<p>

<LI>The Treaty of Rome should be amended to allow accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.<p>

<LI>The IGC should also provide the opportunity to establish a framework of transparency and accountability at EU level in the field of military, security and police transfers. An EU Code of Conduct on Arms Trade would be a good first step in that direction.<p>

</OL>

<p>At a more general level, Amnesty calls for the principles of transparency and accountability to be incorporated in the EU treaties as a fundamental basis for all activity and recommends that a right of information for the public matters concerning EU human rights issues be provided in the Treaty itself.</p>

<p><b>3.	EU/WTO/BANANAS</b></p>

<p>A World Trade Organisation arbitrarian panel has begun examining the complaint lodged by the United States and four Latin American producer countries against the Union banana import system. According to the legal advisers for the Caribbean exporter countries, notably the  European representative of the Caribbean Banana Exporters Association (CBEA), the US argued that only government representatives should be admitted to the hearing, thus excluding the legal advisers from the session, and "further infringing upon the right of Caribbean producers to defend themselves, when 60% of their export earnings are in danger". The CBEA also warned of the "economic disaster" facing its producers should the European scheme be judged illegal.</p>

<p><b>4.	GENERAL AFFAIRS INFORMAL</b></p>

<UL>

<LI>EU governments expressed their "absolute opposition" to US Helms-Burton legislation punishing European for profiting from Cuba. No nation, they said, should unilaterally impose its laws to others. But rather than carry out their threat to ask for a WTO arbitrarian panel on the dispute, ministers appeared to agree to postpone such action until after the US election.<p>

<LI>The Irish presidency reiterated its pledge to have a draft text of the revised Maastricht Treaty ready to give to Dutch officials when they take over the EU presidency. Foreign ministers set 5 October as the date for a mini-summit in Dublin, which Spring said would be an occasion for top-level reflection on IGC matters.<p>

<LI>Led by Belgium, ministers agreed to promote an EU-wide initiative to combat sexual abuse and the exploitation of children. They agreed that their governments would begin work immediately on proposals to be discussed by the EU justice and interior ministers at their informal meeting in Dublin on 27 September. The Commission also said it would present a proposal at that meeting.<p>

</UL>

<p><b>5.	EU/CITIZENS</b></p>

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID began work in Uganda in 1981. Today work in four development areas is reaching a
population of more than 180,000 people. Communities in all four areas are getting the support they
need to develop the management structures needed to take control of their own development. 

<p>As the capacity of these community groups increases, the need for ACTIONAID's input decreases.
Programme activities include development of adult and child literacy, primary healthcare,
agricultural production, access to clean water and improvement of sanitation.  

<p><h3>Examples of ACTIONAID's work In Uganda</h3>
<b> ACTIONAID has: </b>
<p><ul><li> developed a distance learning scheme for primary school teachers which has now been
extended across Uganda by the Ministry of Education. Called MITEP (the Mubende Integrated Teacher
Education Programme), 900 teachers participated in the original scheme, 80 per cent of whom had had
no formal training.

<p><li> supported the development of TASO (The Aids Support Organisation), the first community-based
HIV/AIDS organisation in Uganda. Approximately 10 per cent of the population is affected by HIV/AIDS,
with the biggest group between the 16-40 age range. Through the Strategies for Action programmes,
ACTIONAID continues to support grassroots organisations providing counselling and services to people
affected.

<p><li> helped farmers whose production is hampered by declining soil fertility, prevalence of crop
disease and lack of access to markets. Discussion with local people helps identify the best strategy
for development, whether through establishing savings and credit groups, better storage facilities or
training in new techniques.

<P>

<B>1. BURMA</B>

<P>

The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Thursday afternoon

which calls for economic sanctions against Burma. The motion on

the political situation and human rights abuses in Burma welcomes

recent decisions of Carlsberg and Heineken to withdraw all investments

from Burma.

<P>

The motion also calls on the European Council to respond in full

to Aung San Suu Kyi's request that the EU implements economic

sanctions against the SLORC with the establishment of a trade

boycott, the cessation of tourism and the withdrawal of investment

in Burma by European Companies. Aung San Suu Kyi specifically

addressed the EP through a video, taped in Rangoon last week,

and smuggled out of the country by the Burma Center of the Netherlands.

The Burmese people will not suffer from economic sanctions, she

said.

<P>

At the General Affairs Council  of the 15 July, the Ministers

criticised Burma's government for suppressing democracy movements

there, but did not agree to Danish demands for sanctions against

Rangoon. EU governments said they did not want to impose sanctions

on Burma without UN backing.

<P>

Forty-six organisations based in thirteen European countries and

in the United States of America call today for economic sanctions

against Burma. The organisations endorse a petition in support

of the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament. A number

of member organisations from Eurostep, Aprodev and Euro-Cidse

have signed this petition.

<P>

On 24 July, a small demonstration will be held in front of the

Parliament Building at 8h30. Afterwards, the Burma group will

present the case at the Development Committee of the European

Parliament. The purpose of this meeting is to provide the Committee

with information and analysis of current political and economic

developments. After the meeting a press conference has been organised.

A follow-up meeting will be held at Eurostep from 14h00 to 18h00

on the European strategy with all NGOs who will be there.

<P>

<B>2. RULES OF PROCEDURES </B>

<P>

The European Parliament finally adopted this week the new rules

concerning the MEP's financial interests and the conduct for lobbyist.

<P>

The new rules aim to close the loopholes in the present arrangements

for the Parliament's 626 MEPs.

<P>

In future they will have to make a personal, detailed declaration

of their professional activities, any other paid functions or

activities and financial or staff support they receive from anywhere

except the Parliament. Nonetheless, they do not have to say how

much they earn. These details will be kept in a register, which

will be updated annually and open to the public.

<P>

In future, lobbyist will have to sign a register and comply with

a code of conduct in exchange for a pass granting them regular

access to MEPs and assistants. The code will be drawn up by the

Parliament's rules committee after the summer holidays.

<P>

The code is expected to take as its starting point the guidelines

which the institution's quaestors already require regular visitors

to respect. That 13-point set of instructions is directed at embassies,

consulates, representations of states and regions, commercial

organisations and public affairs practitioners dealing with EU

institutions.

<P>

As MEPs continue to bring more transparency into their own dealings,

they are also facing demands to clarify the status of their assistants,

many of whom live in Belgium in a legal twilight.

<P>

<B>3. CFSP</B>

<P>

The European Parliament, for which the external perception of

CFSP could be improved by giving a single Commissioner all competencies

in matters of external action, deplores the fact that the Commission

had presented no proposal for joint action to the Council, and

stresses the importance that the Commission should exercise its

right of initiative in the field. As for the Council, the EP regrets

that it had had insufficient recourse to the instruments provided

for by the Treaty as regards the role of Parliament in CFSP as

well as criticising the &quot;apparent confusion&quot; in the

use of common positions and joint actions. The EP therefore calls

on the Council to inform it regularly on developments in CFSP

and to consult it as a preventative measure on common positions

and joint actions that it intends adopting.

<P>

The Union is growing in size and in its institutions, Gay Mitchel,

Minister of State, observed on behalf of the Irish Presidency.

Its role as regards external relations is much greater that was

the case for the other presidencies, he observed. CFSP has to

evolve too and <I>Member States have vote to design CFSP institutions

to suit any foreign viewpoint, but to suit the evolution of the

Union</I>. In this context, the Union has to consider security

in its wider sense, including for example the fight against drugs.

Neutral countries would have a role to play in this context. The

WEU Treaty expires in 1998, but there needs to be exploration

of the role neutral countries could have within its framework:

the institutions have to show imagination.

<P>

Next Monday, 22 July, the negotiators of the CFSP will meet in

Brussels, and the Irish Presidency will bring new proposals on

the table.

<P>

Speaking for the Commission, Hans van den Broek, noted a &quot;dire

need&quot; for action, for instruments and political will.

<P>

<B>3. EU/ASEAN</B>

<P>

The European Commission is hoping to widen the Union's links with

Asia by moving quickly to reinforce ties with India and Pakistan.

<P>

External Relations Commissioner, Manuel Marin, will visit Pakistan

on 20 July before heading for Indonesia to hold talks with foreign

ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Brief visits to Malaysia and Thailand will follow.

<P>

Before leaving for Pakistan, Marin said he wanted to expand the

Euro-Asia dialogue by either inviting India and Pakistan to the

London summit or by creating a separate &quot;political platform&quot;

for relations between Europe and South Asia.

<P>

Seeking to smooth ruffled feathers in Pakistan for example, Marin

says that instead of looking at negative measures such as sanctions,

he hopes to cooperate with Islamabad on eliminating child labour.

<P>

Unless South Asian countries made faster progress in developing

closer regional ties, said Marin, they could not secure a region-to-region

dialogue with Europe. But he promised that bilateral ties with

individual countries would be strengthened.

<P>

<B>4. PETER BASTOGI</B>

<P>

Despite that Peter is still in hospital, he is recovering slowly

but surely from his meningitis. He will probably come out next

week.

<P>

<B>5. PAF HOLIDAYS</B>

<P>

The PAF will have some rest and reappear again at the beginning

of September. We wish you all a  wonderful holiday.<HR>

The decade bydecade summary of UNICEF's activities clearly shows the changes in attitudeand approach taken by the 'First World'  towards 'development' in the 'Third'.<BR><BR>Many people are confused or angered by the use of terms like: developingcountries, less developed countries, developed countries, third world, north/south.These are all shorthand terms to express the discrepancies of wealth andstandard of living which exist between the fully industrialised countriesof Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand and countries in LatinAmerica, Africa and Asia.

<font size=3 face=helvetica,arial><b>LIVING WITH DISASTER</b></font><br>

<font size=3 face=helvetica,arial>Over the past 20 years, four million people have been killed in natural
disasters. Drought, floods, earthquakes, typhoons and hurricanes have in some way disrupted the lives of
close to half the population of the planet. A conservative estimate of the cos of repairing the damage to
affected communities runs at US$40 billion per annum - almost as much as the rich countries provide in
development assistance every year. <p>


However, relatively inexpensive investment could reap huge rewards in reducing human suffering and
reconstruction. Creating seed banks for when crops fail; building earthquakes resistant housing; and
teaching people how to quickly set up small-scale enteprises in the aftermath of disaster are among
hundreds of cost-efficient containment measures which can work in even the poorest countries.<p>


To mark the launch of the 1996 World Disasters Report, TVE, in association with Intermediate
Technology, has produced four, 10' news features and a 26' documentary focusing on the untold stories
of disaster. Filmed in Colombia, Peru, the Philippines, Bangadesh and Zimbabwe, our crew has revisited
sites that made world television news coverage in the 1990s. Dramatic rights-cleared archive footage of
disasters is mixed with accounts of how local communities have bounced back.<p>
 

<b>Ordering Information:</b><br>

<small>VHS VIEWING COPIES OF THE LATIN AMERICA, PHILIPPINES AND BANGLADESH FEATURES WILL BE
AVAILABLE AT THE END OF MARCH 1996; THE ZIMBABWE FEATURE AND THE 26' DOCUMENTARY WILL BE
AVAILABLE AT THE END OF APRIL 1996. TV STATIONS MAY EDIT THE FEATURES TO SUIT THIR OWN
BROADCAST STRANDS AND ACCESS TO CAMERA TAPES CAN BE PROVIDED TO STATIONS THAT WANT TO
MAKE THEIR OWN VERSIONS.</small>
</font>
<p>


<font size=3 face=helvetica,arial><b><a href="../er/index.html">EARTH REPORT</a></b></font><br>

<font size=3 face=helvetica,arial>Starting on the 31st March, BBC World television will be transmitting a
weekly environment and development series introduced by David Attenborough whose Life on Earth,
Trials of Life and Secret of Life of Plants series are among the most popular BBC progrmming of all time.
<p>


Jointly produced by TVE with WWF International, Earth Report consists of 52 x 5' news features for
broadcast to BBC viewers in Asia, the Gulf, Africa and Europe. Arabic and Japanese versions will be made by
the BBC. Spanish versions will be beamed from Mdrid by ATEI to Latin America starting in the summer.<p>


Topics to be aired include: a new method of farming that can help save the Mountain Gorilla; the
ecological catastrophe enveloping the Black Sea; how banditry can be linked to desertification; improving
health care in Guatemala and Guinea Bissau; and ecolabelling for Indonesian hardwoods.<p>
 

In addition to the BBC and ATEI broadcasts, TVE and WWF will send out the programmes in packages of 25
to their respective broadcast networks around the world.</font><p>


<font size=3 face=helvetica,arial><b>AFRICA EXPRESS</b></font><br>

<font size=3 face=helvetica,arial>Africa Express is a new eight part series presenting Africa from an African
perspective. African reporters cover the stories which illustrate the life and culture of their continent
south of the Sahara. A TVE/Channel 4 and SABC co-production, the Africa Epress stories leave aside the
Western news agenda for a refreshingly different view of events in Africa. <p>


Reviewing the first episode, the UK's daily newspaper, The Guardian reports: "Good for Channel 4 UK and
the producers for commissioning a magazine which shows the real Africa rather than the endless white
man's tales of famine and war. This, they thought,would explode the myth that it's full of squabbling
tribes who spread deadly sexual diseases and would swindle their own grandmother. So far so good."<p>

Coop&eacute;ration UE-Samoa occidentales<br>

Priorit&eacute; aux services d'utilit&eacute; publique</h2>

par <i>Myfanwy van de Velde</i>

<h4>Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>le Courrier ACP-UE</i><br>no. 159,

septembre-octobre 1996: pages 43-44</h4>

</center><hr>

<P>

<B>La coop&eacute;ration entre les Samoa occidentales et la Communaut&eacute;

europ&eacute;enne remonte &agrave; 1975, date d'adh&eacute;sion

de ce pays &agrave; la Convention de Lom&eacute;. Le secteur de

l'&eacute;nergie a &eacute;t&eacute;, d&egrave;s le d&eacute;part,

le principal b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire des fonds programmables

(4,6 millions d'ECU au titre de Lom&eacute; I et 6 millions d'ECU

au titre de Lom&eacute; II) avec le financement du Projet hydro&eacute;lectrique

de Samasoni &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es 1970 et du projet

hydro&eacute;lectrique de Sauniatu au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es

1980</B>.

<P>

 Un programme regroupant 260 micror&eacute;alisations a &eacute;t&eacute;

parall&egrave;lement financ&eacute; en vue du d&eacute;veloppement

de l'&eacute;levage de volailles et de porcs, ainsi que de la

p&ecirc;che ; il englobe 96 villages sur les &icirc;les principales

d'Upolu et Savai'i. Un montant suppl&eacute;mentaire de 890.000

ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; attribu&eacute; &agrave; la Western Samoa

Development Bank sous la forme d'une ligne de cr&eacute;dit destin&eacute;e

&agrave; accro&icirc;tre sa capacit&eacute; de pr&ecirc;t. Par

ailleurs, &agrave; l'&eacute;poque o&ugrave; les exportations

de coprah &eacute;taient encore importantes, la Communaut&eacute;

a financ&eacute; des installations de stockage et de manutention

de l'huile et des tourteaux de coprah (900.000 ECU).

<P>

 Outre l'aide programmable, les Samoa occidentales ont re&ccedil;u

12 transferts du Stabex d'un montant total de 9,3 millions d'ECU

en compensation de la chute des exportations de coprah, de bois,

de bananes et de cacao entre 1975 et 1984.

<P>

 La valorisation du potentiel hydro&eacute;lectrique consid&eacute;rable

de ce pays s'est poursuivie au cours de Lom&eacute; III, et les

Samoa occidentales ont effectu&eacute; des progr&egrave;s majeurs

vers l'autonomie &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique. Alors qu'en 1980,

pr&egrave;s de 78 % de l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; &eacute;taient

produits par des installations au diesel, cette proportion atteignait

26 % &agrave; peine en 1986. Le volume des importations p&eacute;troli&egrave;res

destin&eacute;es &agrave; la production d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;

a diminu&eacute; &agrave; 36 % au cours de la p&eacute;riode 1982-86.

Ce volume a encore &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;duit suite &agrave;

la construction de la centrale hydro&eacute;lectrique d'Afulio

(Lom&eacute; III et IV), ce qui permet d'importantes &eacute;conomies

en termes de devises. Ce projet - cofinanc&eacute; par la Banque

asiatique de d&eacute;veloppement, la BEI, la Banque mondiale

et la Western Samoa Electric Power Corporation - couvre la construction

d'un r&eacute;servoir de 10 millions de m&egrave;tres cube, d'un

canal d'amen&eacute;e et d'une centrale &eacute;lectrique, ainsi

que l'installation de l'&eacute;quipement m&eacute;canique et

des lignes de transmission. Il a sensiblement am&eacute;lior&eacute;

la qualit&eacute; de l'approvisionnement &eacute;lectrique sur

l'&icirc;le d'Upolu.

<P>

 D'autres travaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;s gr&acirc;ce

aux fonds de Lom&eacute; IV en vue de la distribution d'eau en

r&eacute;gions rurales : un plan directeur et une &eacute;tude

d'am&eacute;nagement ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s

pour plusieurs zones rurales, et une campagne de sensibilisation

de l'opinion publique &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'utilisation

rationnelle des ressources hydriques est pr&eacute;vue parall&egrave;lement

&agrave; l'avancement des travaux d'infrastructure.

<P>

 Enfin, un programme d'un million d'ECU a &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;

au financement de micror&eacute;alisations visant &agrave; r&eacute;nover

l'infrastructure des communaut&eacute;s rurales en mati&egrave;re

de distribution d'eau, de sant&eacute;, d'&eacute;ducation, de

tourisme, d'agriculture et de p&ecirc;che.

<P>

 Les versements du Stabex au titre de Lom&eacute; III (1985-1989)

et de Lom&eacute; IV (1990-1994) se sont respectivement &eacute;lev&eacute;s

&agrave; 11,1 et 5,7 millions d'ECU. Ces paiements ont &eacute;t&eacute;

effectu&eacute;s au titre d'une indemnisation des pertes subies

par l'huile et autres produits &agrave; base de coprah, ainsi

que des pertes encourues par les exportations de f&egrave;ves

de cacao et de bois brut.

<P>

 Outre cette aide non remboursable, la BEI a octroy&eacute; depuis

1981 un total de 9 millions d'ECU environ sous la forme de capitaux

&agrave; risque, principalement utilis&eacute;s dans le cadre

des projets hydro&eacute;lectriques de Sauniatu et d'Afulio.

<P>

 Une somme suppl&eacute;mentaire de 660.896 d'ECU a &eacute;t&eacute;

allou&eacute;e au titre d'une aide d'urgence aux Samoa occidentales

suite &agrave; un incendie de grande envergure sur l'&icirc;le

de Savai'i en 1983, et suite aux cyclones d&eacute;vastateurs

Ofa et Val en 1990 et 1991.

<P>

 La programmation de la tranche suivante du financement communautaire

dans le cadre du 8&egrave;me FED n'est pas encore termin&eacute;e

mais tout porte &agrave; croire qu'elle donnera la priorit&eacute;

&agrave; l'extension et &agrave; la modernisation du r&eacute;seau

de distribution de l'eau.

<p align=justify><b>1.	MASSIVE CUTS TO THE EU DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION BUDGET</b></p>

<p align=justify>The European Union is in the middle of the 1997 EU Budget procedure. The Council has proposed massive cuts of 289 MECU to development cooperation expenditure (53% of the overall cut in external relations and a 13% decrease compared to the 1996 Budget). The cuts are particularly evident when one looks at individual development cooperation budget lines - budget lines focused on cooperation measures decrease by 27%; the NGO co-financing line decreases 13.8%; rehabilitation in development countries decreases 23.4%; and other lines such as women and development and landmines are deleted. The amounts cut from these budget lines have been transferred to the EU's MEDA programme (Measures to accompany the reforms to the economic and social structures in the Mediterranean non-member countries) - the Council proposes 842 MECU (a 109% increase) to be allocated to this line.</p>

<p align=justify>The draft budget cuts a total of 546.8 MECU from various existing external relations' budget lines. The agreed ceiling on external expenditure allows at most 312.3 MECU of this reduction to be re-instated. In addition to the re-instating of nearly 300 MECU that amendments tabled at the EP Development Committee will propose, it is expected that amendments by the EP's other two external committees will seek the re-instatement of other budget lines.</p>

<p align=justify>The Development Committee will table amendments to reinstate 1996 budget amounts for development cooperation. To do this they will most likely propose 234.5 MECU be taken from the proposed MEDA line increase and redistributed to developing countries. The MEDA line would then still be increased to 607.5 MECU (51% increase over 1996).</p>

<p align=justify><b>2.	THE GREEN PAPER AND THE LOME CONVENTION</b></p>

<p align=justify>The battle to revamp the lom&eacute; Convention, the trade and aid agreement linking the European Union to 70 ACP states, starts in autumn. European Commissioner Jo&atilde;o de Deus Pinheiro will trigger the long-awaited public debate on the future of the Convention by publishing a Green Paper in October. Comments will then be sought from EU and ACP governments, the European Parliament, NGOs, academics and business leaders.</p>

<p align=justify>Under the convention's rules, negotiations on its future must open at least 18 months before the pacts runs out. To keep this calendar, the Commission will ask ACP and EU representatives to give their views on the future of the convention in the first half of 1997. Pinheiro will then drawn up a formal negotiating mandate for ministerial approval at the end of 1997. Negotiations will open officially with the ACP group in September 1998.</p>

<p align=justify>The Commission says it is going into the difficult debate with a completely open mind. But it will not be easy.</p>

<p align=justify>"Poor nations are loosing their economic significance to us", says Dieter Frisch, a former Commissioner director-general for development. "There is a growing feeling that development policy has not achieved a great deal, especially in the very area where most aid has been directed: Africa. This provides enough pretext to cut development aid at a time of budgetary constraints". Frisch argues that the spirit of North-South partnership and dialogue engendered by the Lom&eacute; Convention are worth preserving.</p>

<p align=justify>The ACP states have not worked out a joint position on the future of Lom&eacute;. But while critical of some aspects of the convention, most ACP representatives insist that the pact should be preserved.</p>

<p align=justify>"The Lom&eacute; Convention has made a significant contribution to alleviating poverty and providing jobs", says Lingston Cumberbatch, current 'president' of the ACP group of ambassadors in Brussels. "What we want to see is a good and effective convention which encourages investments in the ACP states and supports the private sector".</p>

<p align=justify>ACP representatives also say they want a new Lom&eacute; Convention which is "user-friendly and non-bureaucratic". The ACP business leaders argue that the convention is much too complex and technically complicated".</p>

<p align=justify>The Commission's Green paper will look closely at the issue of "differentiation": i.e. suggestions that instead of working with an unwieldy group of  70 ACP nations, the EU should hammer out separate agreements with ACP regions or even sub-regions.</p>

<p align=justify><b>3.	EU-ASEAN RELATIONSHIP</b></p>

<p align=justify>When ten Asian presidents and prime ministers met 15 EU leaders for a summit in Bangkok six months ago, a lot of promises were made by the Europeans while Asian talked about finally finding a seat on the international scene.</p>

<p align=justify>Now they are getting down to business and discovering that things are not that easy. The two sides disagree on many principles and most details. Quarrels over human rights are straining political closeness and spats over labour standards are hindering trade talks. Disappointment with each other and broken ranks on either side are now becoming increasingly evident.</p>

<p align=justify>But trade is, and will continue to be, the crux of the relationship which is bringing Europe closer to China, Japan, South Korea and the nations of Southeast Asia. The two sides also have a political forum in which to discuss security matters -the Asian Regional Forum (ARF)- which is growing in importance almost daily.</p>

<p align=justify>With some 425 million people and high economic growth (its members' combined average annual growth rate is 7.25% - three times that of the Union), the ASEAN bloc also controls some of the world's most crucial shipping routes.</p>

<p align=justify>"Effective recognition of ASEAN's leading role should push the European Union to make it a focal point of its political presence in Asia", said External Relations Commissioner Manuel Marin. Calling for yearly meetings of political experts in fields such as maritime safety, nuclear capacity, drug trafficking and peacekeeping, the Commissioner continues: "Despite many contacts and important programmes, we are witnessing a regrettably static application of our agreement".</p>

<p align=justify>The ARF already provides a forum for discussion on subjects such as nuclear weapons and landmines with all the major players on the Asian continent. It groups foreign ministers of the EU, China, Japan, Russia, the US, India and ASEAN, and Pakistan has applied to join.</p>

<p align=justify>Two events rattled participants at the ARF's July ministerial meeting in Jakarta. But they also demonstrated how important its members perceive the forum to be.</p>

<p align=justify>Arguing that their status as nuclear powers gave them reason to be there in a capacity distinct from that of the EU, the UK and France applied to join, angering their Union partners.</p>

<p align=justify>Subsequently, when Myanmar (Burma) was admitted to the forum, EU governments protested over Rangoon's political and human rights record. Having returned home from the Bangkok summit with the understanding that Europeans would not preach to Asians, the latter were upset by what they saw as Union backtracking.</p>

<p align=justify>Burma is just as divisive an issue within the EU itself. As both France and the UK have economic interests in Burma, they would probably reject the sanctions that other EU partners have already hinted at, and the Union looks set to continue wrestling with Burmese rights problems as it has for years with Indonesia over East Timor.</font></p>

<ul><center><h1>Burden of dreams
</h1>

<p>

<font size=+1><i>An emotional arrival...<br>Three children too many... <br>One of two wives in a second-best marriage...<br> Houses changing shape<br> - is that progress or a problem?</i></font>
<p>
</center></ul>
<font size=-1>Mariama with her seventh child, two-year-old Rasinatu,<br> something of an indulged favourite with both mother and father</font>
<hr width=70%><p>
<br clear=left>
<font size=+2>A</font> teenager is leading me through the two kilometres of open country that separate the outlying district of Bidiga, where I am to live, from the centre of Sabtenga. I need his guidance. I thought I would remember my way but I haven't a clue which path to take. To Westerners the word 'village' conveys a clump of houses clustered around a road or central square. That doesn't begin to conjure up Sabtenga, whose 5,000 inhabitants sprawl over a vast area, each living in complex warrens of huts, yards and passageways called concessions. These concessions can house anything between 10 and 100 people - they can be a bit like a village in themselves and are separated from the neighbouring concession by anything from twenty to hundreds of metres of rough, baked earth.
<p>
Identifying Mariama's concession would have been just as impossible, though I recognize the huge tree at its entrance as I pass. This is dressed not only in leaves but in wrinkled skin - hundreds of bats hang from its upper branches and burst into alarming life every evening the moment the sun takes its leave of the horizon.
<p>
To tell the truth I am a bit nervous - I am approaching the key moment in this whole adventure, since it was Mariama's insights that opened the door for me on the life of the village ten years ago. She is pleased to see me and gives me an enthusiastic kiss but after that I think neither of us knows quite what to do. She looks a touch more careworn - but nowhere near as much as I do (a soldier at the airport looked at the fresh-faced photo in my passport and then back at me about five times in half-feigned incredulity). 
<p>
We sit down in her courtyard and exchange the most basic news while she pummels at some millet for the evening meal - the everyday staple in the village is a thick, sticky millet porridge or t, chunks of which you dip into a thin vegetable sauce. Her younger children pull at and clamour round her as she works.
<p>
Ah yes, those younger children. When I was here ten years ago Mariama told me clearly that she didn't want any more than the four children she then had. It was a matter of some urgency for her since the traditional period of grace for a mother after the birth of a child was coming to an end - she knew that Issa, her husband, would soon be resuming his visits to her hut. The familiar sickness and swelling would follow as inevitably as night follows day. She knew they had pills to stop pregnancy in the capital but what use was that here? I remember feeling desperate to think of some way out for her but without contraception her only hope was to persuade Issa that another child would not be a good idea.
<p>
The inevitable happened and she now has seven children. She is unusually lucky that all her babies have survived - her co-wife Alia, for 
<p>
example, lost four of her seven children. But there is a flipside to this luck: Mariama is an active, intelligent woman who feels besieged by her smaller children and who is desperately conscious of the burden of feeding so many. 
<p>
'I wanted to stop at four,' she tells me the next day when we are a bit more used to each other again. 'But it wasn't possible. First Issa didn't want to stop. And second there were no pills in the village.' It seems contraceptives only became available a year ago - and even now they are used by only 12 women.
<p>
Mariama's story seems to scotch one myth about population: the one which says that people without contraceptive technology will find some natural method of their own. True, the Bissa had evolved a method of birth spacing through the husband's sexual abstinence for two years after the birth. But in this case a woman who was absolutely convinced that she didn't want more children was unable to prevent their coming. 'It's children that drain a woman and exhaust her,' she says. 
<p>

<ul><font size=-1>Issa takes a break from building work on another new house in the concession.</font></ul>
<hr width=60%>
<p>

But for Issa the drain on his wife counted less than the potential help in the fields later on - the traditional peasant argument in favour of more children. Now, ten years and three children later, he is finally convinced that another mouth to feed would be bad news. So perhaps Mariama's tired body will get some rest. But it's a sad, sad thought that she's been subjected to so much.
<p>
I think Issa always knew he was getting an unusual package when he took Mariama as his second wife. She says he understood from the start, even as a man who had to live and die by farming his own land, that Mariama would not work in the fields - that she never had and never would. What he was getting instead was a woman of ability and outspokenness - qualities other men would not necessarily have valued in a wife and which won her election to the village's Committee for the Defence of the Revolution, established by Sankara to challenge the conservative power of rural chiefs.
<p>
When I first met her she was 28: tall and slim, still young despite her four children and with a face so infused with life that it looked all the time as though she were poised on the brink of laughter. All the same, she made no bones about telling me how hard she found life in the village, which she contrasted with her childhood memories of rain and plenty in the nearby town of Garango.
<p>
Her father had served as a soldier with the French in Vietnam and gained financial security as a result. And he had marked that in the traditional fashion by taking four wives, so there had always been plenty of brothers and sisters around to play with. He was also a devout Muslim - and this turned out to have a profound impact on the course of his daughter's life.
<p>
By the time Mariama was 17, the traditional age for a Bissa woman to marry, she had fallen in love with a young gendarme in the town. But it was a doomed affair. The fact that he was from a Catholic family might not have presented an insuperable obstacle - Catholics and Muslims live happily cheek by jowl in the village and, provided the woman (never the man) is prepared to adapt, marriages between the communities are not uncommon. But the gendarme was an atheist and Mariama's father absolutely ruled out the idea of a son-in-law who did not pray. She did not even think of standing out against her father's judgement: the marriage she preferred was simply not to be.
<p>
Instead she had no alternative but to marry another, older suitor who already had one wife. It could have been much worse. Issa was a quiet man of 30 whom she knew would be steady and never beat her. Besides, there was at first the excitement of cosmopolitan Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire. But after two years Issa's father died and they had to return to Sabtenga so he could become head of the family. It is still a source of regret that they did not have time to build up more savings to underpin their lives as subsistence farmers.
<p>
This notion of material comfort as something that comes from Cote d'Ivoire or Ghana is ubiquitous in the village. The community lives by subsistence agriculture - people grow enough millet to see them through the year during the rainy season that stretches from May until the harvest in September. Surpluses can be sold to raise cash but surpluses are rare. Instead young men still follow the model set when the French used what is now Burkina Faso as a pool of forced labour for the resource-rich coastal areas. They set out in search of work on the plantations or in the cities. Some never come back. Some go just during the dry season when no useful work can be done in the fields. Some build up a nest-egg to the point where they can return and set themselves up with a wife (or three).
<p>
It's odd witnessing the effect of such cash infusions over a long period. If I were visiting Sabtenga for the first time now I would probably just be struck by the hardship of subsistence life. Yet having known the village ten years ago I can't help but be struck by signs of material progress that I hadn't really expected to find. 
<p>
Ten years ago, for example, I was desperately aware of people's backbreaking labour in the fields. They walked kilometres to reach their fields then bent double to hack at the bitter earth with their dabas (small hoes). 'Can't they get any help at all with this work?' I remember thinking, being more used to Asia, where oxen pulling ploughs are the norm. 
<p>
To my surprise, the ox and plough have now arrived in Sabtenga. By no means all households have them - and Issa and Mariama are among those who cannot yet afford them. But many households do have oxen, as well as donkey carts in which to bring the harvest back from the fields - a significant advance for women, who used to carry it in vast bundles on their heads. Those who have managed to buy an ox can also cultivate a much larger area, which is especially important when the fertility of the soil is declining. The other family I knew best ten years ago was that of Zenabou and Adama, about whom we made our film. They now have no less than 12 oxen and in material terms are pulling away from their neighbours.
<p>
As this suggests, a gap between 'rich' and 'poor' is beginning to open up within the village - and as in all societies, the awareness of your own poverty becomes more painful when someone else's relative prosperity is staring you in the face. 
<p>
Even the houses now testify to this. Ten years ago people lived as their foreparents had since time immemorial - in concessions composed of small round huts with conical thatched roofs. I certainly had no thought that this traditional housing was likely to change. Yet it has. 
<p>
They are still building with mud, which is softened with well-water then poured into a mould to form a brick that hardens in the sun for a day. When they have enough bricks they use mud as mortar and build up a rectangular house which is roofed with sheets of corrugated iron. 
<p>
I am used to decrying corrugated iron as a terrible sign of Westernization in a tropical clime - it is an expensive, industrially produced item which invites rather than repels the heat. But you have to listen to what the villagers say. They know full well that corrugated iron makes their houses hotter. But it will not leak during the rains as even the best thatch is liable to - and it will last for fifteen years instead of just two. Even more to the point, the high-quality straw traditionally used for roofing is becoming impossible to find in the bush.
<p>
If I come back in another ten years I may well find only donkeys in thatched huts. That will certainly be so if the villagers have any choice in the matter, since only the lack of money to pay for corrugated iron stands in their way. As a result the village will look altogether less picturesque to Western eyes. But people will probably be happier in homes which are more spacious, more durable and, sad to say, more free from the connotation of poverty now attached to the traditional houses.
<p>
Mariama is certainly in no doubt. A box topped with corrugated iron might seem to us a questionable improvement. But to her it would be a palace. She has vivid, longing dreams about living in it - literally her dream home.

After being approved by the Beijing High People's Court, the executions were carried out "in recent days".<p>Chinese police are also sweeping Beijing, expelling jobless rural arrivals and taking activists into custody, in preparation for the conference, according to Amnesty International.<p>"Will the Fourth UN Conference on Women be remembered for contributing to improvements in human rights of women worldwide, or for the human rights violations against Chinese citizens committed in the name of 'safeguarding the capital's public order'?"<p>Further human rights violations should not be tolerated in China's preparations for a conference that will discuss the status and rights of women, according to Amnesty International, which will raise protest about this crackdown with the Government of China and governments attending the conference.<p>In the continuing crackdown before the conference, which will run from 30 August to 15 September, authorities briefly detained Beijing resident Tong Zeng after he organised a news conference for women forced into prostitution for soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. The news conference was stormed by police as an old Chinese woman was relating her experience as "comfort woman". <p>Tong was later released, reportedly ordered to leave Bejing, and warned not to attend the NGO Forum, where he is registered through his China Research Center for Aging. <p>The "public order" crackdown in the run-up to the women's conference occurs against the backdrop of continuing repression of political dissent since the end of May, Amnesty International said. About half of the 50 dissidents detained around the last 4 June anniversary of Tiananmen events are believed to be still in detention. <p>One dissident recently released after six years of detention, Liu Gang, issued an open letter to Chinese authorities complaining that police are harassing him and his family. Liu has said that authorities beat him during his years in prison. Other dissidents recently taken into custody include Liu Fenggang and Gao Feng, two Christian activists with close ties to the dissident community <p>"Amnesty International is alerting all those who plan to attend the conference that China's so-called efforts to 'safeguard the public order' for their arrival limits the full diversity of opinion represented at the conference," the organization said.<p><hr>©Copyright: Amnesty International - 16 AUGUST 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif">Amnesty International Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<html><head><title>Children First - Beijing - A Wasted Effort?</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#333366" vlink="#3399ff" text="#000000"><img src="../unicef_pix/unicef_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="../unicef_info.html"> UNICEF </i></a><hr><h3>BEIJING - A WASTED EFFORT?</h3><h4>Vanessa Redgrave, UNICEF's Special Representative for the Performing Arts, outlines UNICEF's hopes for the Fourth World Conference on Women.</h4>      This summer my granddaughter, age three, was playing in a park with a boy of the same age when he ordered "Clean the house, do all the ironing, make sure everything is ready when I get back from work.  OK?"  She replied, "No, I'm going to work too!"<p>     It's probably a typical story.  It shows us that whilst progress has been made in gender equality, much more still needs to be done.    The media, however, seems on the whole reluctant to accept this, preferring instead to trumpet the end of feminism and herald the dawn of a new age of equality. <p>      More concerned with disagreements about the location of the forum for non-governmental organisations, it is questionnable whether the media really understands why the Fourth World Conference on Women is so vital.  Do women themselves understand?  I was unaware until recently of some of the statistics which catalogue the shocking situation of women and girls - that 70% of the children in the world not attending school are girls, that 500,000 women still die each year from pregnancy and childbirth, or that because of sex-selective abortions or infanticide an estimated 100 million fewer women are alive today than could be expected.  As we look around we see the conditions of women at work growing worse in all countries.  Increasing unemployment means more and more young girls on the street.  Domestic violence continues to blight women's lives in rich as well as poor countries.  Look around.  It is not hard to justify the need for this Conference. <p>     We have to stress that these are not just issues for women.  Women's struggle for rights and justice (for this is what equality means) are issues of concern to all.  When world leaders meet in Beijing to set an agenda for the advancement of women into the next century, they will be discussing issues ranging from poverty to armed conflict, from the environment to media distortions and stereotypes.  If half the world's population continues to be denied the chance to participate fully in all areas of public and private life, it is not only individual lives that are affected, but the future of entire nations. <p>     Beginning from birth, girls in many parts of the world experience the "apartheid of gender".  Their fundamental rights - to nutrition, health care, education, to work at a trade or profession, to vote, even to survive are restricted or denied.  The apartheid of gender has many faces and many manifestations.  In South Asia, for example, neglect of girls means they have markedly lower survival rates.  In some countries, girls spend as much as 80 per cent more time than boys doing domestic tasks.   Girls and women continue to contribute a great deal to economic development, but their contributions go undervalued or unrecognised.<p>     Nor is the apartheid of gender  exclusive to poor countries.  The  situation for women in industrialised countries remains troubling.  In European countries long-term unemployment rates tend to be higher for women.  Women's jobs are increasingly segregated at the lower end of the labour market and most low-paid workers in the European Union are women.  The Women's National Commission in the UK has stated that "female poverty is a fundamental cause of inequality in the UK".  In many countries women remain under-represented in decision-making bodies such as parliaments and ministries.<p>     When Carol Bellamy speaks on behalf of UNICEF at the Beijing Conference she will be speaking for an organisation which places progress towards equality and equity at the core of its guiding principles and goals.  She will be stressing the need to look at the whole life cycle of girls and women.  Because the apartheid of gender begins for girls at birth, and in some parts of the world even before birth, UNICEF uses this "life-cycle perspective" to identify persistent forms of discrimination at each stage, and formulate appropriate programmes and projects to tackle them. <p>     UNICEF bases its work on gender equality on international law, as well as the Plan of Action agreed at the World Summit for Children in 1990.  At the World Summit for Children, national leaders  agreed that "girls must be given equal treatment and opportunities from the very beginning".  They also agreed to "work to strengthen the role and status of women."  10 of the Summit's 27 goals for the year 2000 relate specifically to the needs of girls and women. <p>      The Convention on the Rights of the Child, now ratified by 176 of the world's 191 countries, is another important tool.  It demands that its comprehensive standards for protecting children and ensuring their survival and development apply to all children without discrimination on any basis,  including gender.  UNICEF also supports the universal ratification of the 1993 UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  Children's and women's rights are inextricably linked.  Ensuring that all children's basic rights are safeguarded and needs are met builds a strong foundation for women's rights.  Similarly, eliminating discrimination against women will accelerate global progress in child survival and development.<p>     The foundation for any change in the situation of women has to be education.  It is the key to new opportunities in employment and political participation.  Educated women marry later, and have fewer and healthier children.  Addressing gender inequality in education is particularly important because it undermines the struggle for equality in almost all other fields.<p>       On every level and in every sphere of life women need equal access and full participation in decision making if gender equality is to be a reality.  Worldwide, women hold just 10 per cent of all parliamentary seats      (and only 9 per cent in the UK).  At the United Nations, including UNICEF, women are still far from having an equal role in leadership and decision making.  In the world of work and business, the gender gap widens dramatically as one progresses up the ladder of responsibility and power.  Violence against women and girls needs to be tackled with far greater effort.  Gender oppression, racism, poverty and political repression are all forms and faces of violence, and all affect women and girls disproportionately.  Domestic violence has been recognised as a severe global problem, from the least to the most developed countries.  The proliferation of armed conflicts is taking a brutal toll on civilians around the world, with women and children the main victims of atrocities.  We have all read the terrible reports of the use of rape as an instrument of war, from former Yugoslavia to Rwanda.  Sexual exploitation of girls and women, including sex tourism and child pornography, is a massive global violation of law and human rights.  Female genital mutilation affects some 2 million girls each year.  All these forms of gender-focused violence must be ended, as called for by the Convention on the Elimination of Violence against Women.<p>     What will the World Conference on Women be able to do about this?  Will it be just another talking shop where world leaders can make empty promises they forget as soon as they step on the plane home?  It doesn't have to be.  Since the World Summit for Children in 1990 UNICEF and its partners around the world have been monitoring progress towards the goals agreed for the year 2000.  Significant progress has been made, and UNICEF has seen the value of setting goals which can be used to mobilise action on every level.  Without time-bound goals that are concrete and can be monitored, international commitments will not be implemented.  Without these mechanisms the most inspiring  words will remain just that - words.  The Platform of Action agreed on at Beijing must be followed up in each country by concrete action plans for gender equality and equity.<p>     The voices of women are being heard on all the issues to be discussed at Beijing.  What is more important, they are starting to have an impact.  How much more equal the struggle for human progress would be if women didn't also have to fight against gender oppression.  Let us grasp this opportunity to end it, once and for all.<p><hr>©Copyright: UNICEF 1995<hr><a href="../index.html" target="_parent"><img src="../unicef_pix/unicef_logo2.gif">UNICEF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. MILITARY ACTION STILL REQUIRED IN ZAIRE - EMMA

BONINO</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>European Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino

reiterated her appeal for military action in Zaire on Tuesday

25 November. She expressed her exasperation over the situation

describing the inability of military chiefs and political leaders

to appraise the conditions, location and the number of people

in distress as &quot;amazing&quot;. Mrs. Bonino said that the

&quot;only straightforward answer to the problem is to organise

a military intervention for assessment in the area.&quot; She

stressed that the international community could no longer tolerate

that the destiny of hundreds of thousands of innocent people be

determined in the absence of international action or relief. Mrs

Bonino had earlier on in the week raised the poignant question

of how many refugees lives should be endangered to merit military

action asking whether the figure 700 000 refugees or a million

was enough to justify action.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Also earlier on Monday the EU Council of Foreign

Ministers meeting on Monday 25 November said that they still felt

an international force was needed to assist the refugees in East

Zaire. France and Spain recalled their willingness to contribute

men to the force, however, British Foreign Minister cautioned

that it was difficult to take any action without an overall view

of the situation. The Council also welcomed the European Commission's

decision to provide a Community contribution from ECHO for the

UN Trust Fund and stressed on the need for the early convening

of an international conference on peace and stability in the region

under the auspices of the Organisation for African Unity and the

UN.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>On the same day the Rwandan government announced

that it will not permit the use of its territory by a multinational

force and added that it viewed military intervention as unnecessary

in contradiction to the advice of the head of the Medecins Sans

Frontieres mission in Kigali.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. EU DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL APPROVES OF WIDE RANGE

OF DEVELOPMENT RESOLUTIONS INCLUDING MEASURES CONCERNING CRISIS

IN ZAIRE</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The EU Development Council approved a wide range

of items on Friday 22 November with the main focus centring on

the persistent crisis in the Great Lakes Region. On this issue

the Council backed the urgent implementation of the UN Security

Council resolution to convey aid to East Zaire and facilitate

free return of refugees to their countries of origin. The Council

also adopted a joint action which calls for voluntary contributions

supporting African participation in a multinational force. A budget

of 15 million ECU is envisaged for this action. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Other items adopted were a) a Human and Social Development

Co-operation policy geared towards the development of man with

particular emphasis on poverty alleviation and sustainable development;

b) a conclusion on anti-personnel mines calling for the implementation

of mine clearance operations, the immediate cessation of the use

and marketing of anti-personnel mines and the creation of an international

planning strategy; c) conclusions on recommending the idea of

equality between men and women in crisis prevention, emergency

aid and rehabilitation; d) conclusions calling for the assessment

of humanitarian aid granted since 1991 in the light of the Court

of Auditors report to be presented before the end of the year.

Readers interested in obtaining copies of the press release of

the Council Meeting can contact the nearest Council office or

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. MANUEL OREJA REPORTS ON THE IGC </FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>In his latest report of the proceedings of the InterGovernmental

Conference, EC Audio-visual Commissioner, Marcelino Oreja said

that the recent Heads of State and Governments reaffirmed the

determination to conclude the Conference by the end of June 1997.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>On the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP,

little progress has been made, the recent Foreign Ministers Meeting

on 28 November failed to resolve a single one of the issues considered

to be stalling progress, i.e. the definition of the objectives

and the structures needed to conduct those policies and the voting

procedures in the Council of Ministers. According to Mr. Oreja

the lack of progress is due to insufficient trust between the

Member States and between them and the Commission. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>On the issue of defence, the Union envisages bearing

a share of peacekeeping and humanitarian operation responsibilities

in other parts of the world. Co-operation with NATO will also

continue. Mr Oreja, however said that a more effective solution

for the foreign policy problem, which is a vital aspect of the

conference, will have to be sought. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Finally a schedule for forthcoming IGC events is

included in Mr. Oreja's report. Readers interested in copies of

the report and schedule for the next two months can contact Marcelino

Oreja at the European Commission, Rue de la Loi 200, 1040 Brussels.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. UNHCR FOLLOW UP TO CONFERENCE ON REFUGEES</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>In the follow-up to the <I>Regional Conference to

Address the Problems of Refugees, Displaced Persons, Other Forms

of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees in the Commonwealth

of Independent</I> <I>States and Relevant Neighbouring States,

</I>the UNHCR, has initiated a number of activities to involve

national and international NGOs in monitoring the progress made

after the Conference. The principal area of focus will be the

sharing of information among governments, NGOs, the media and

the general public and the enhancement of NGO participation in

the follow-up to the Conference. A directory and database of NGOs

concerned with the refugee problem in the former Soviet Union

is being set up to provide information, including the UNHCR/IOM

bulletin <I>CISCOF NEWS,</I> to the relevant NGOs. All interested

institutions should contact Kirsti Floor, UNHCR Policy Officer

(NGOs) CIS Conference Regional Bureau for Europe to ask for a

questionnaire for the database and further information. <BR>

The government pledged to ensure that no one would lie sick or die merely because of poverty. As the medical community began to embrace the idea more and more, the NHS became the envy of the world. But, instead of demand tailing off as the general health of the nation improved, it steadily increased over the succeeding half century with each pharmaceutical breakthrough, and the utopian vision was blighted by escalating costs, rising expectations and the needs of an ageing population. Funding the service became a political issue and the patients were those most immediately affected.

But is it really necessary? Although it is customary among Jews, Muslims and Africans, some people believe it is done not because of reasons of hygiene or good health but rather because it identifies the male with the rest of the tribe. As well as looking at the moral and ethical questions surrounding the custom, the programme reveals its dangers.

"We actually found a baby price list," says reporter <b>Emily Buchanan,</b> who travelled to Paraquay to investigate the fast expanding baby trade between the West and the developing world. The team found that of 600 babies sold to childless American and British couples each year, some 400 have been removed from their natural mothers by trickery or pressure. "In one case, a woman was told her husband had been involved in a serious car accident," says Buchanan. "She rushed to the hospital, and the woman who had come with her offered to hold her baby. The mother went to make enquiries, and found her husband hadn't been admitted at all. But when she returned, the woman - and the baby - had gone." Many others, mainly young and poor, are talked into giving up their new-born infants by "midwives", who get commission for every child they secure. These women scour the country looking for suitable victims, often telling them the babies will go into state care, rather than being sold to foreign families. Would-be "purchaser" parents are reluctant to confront the issues - or to talk on camera. "You can understand their position," says Buchanan. "Many of them are desperate for children, having tried fertility treatment and having spent a lot of time and money applying through Paraguayan channels."</ul><p><li><h3>Ths Shadow of a Gunman - BBC2, 8.55pm</h3><ul>A dreaming poet is mistaken by a romantic young girl for an IRA gunman on the run in this production of <b>Sean O'Casey's</b> famous play.</ul><p><br><a name="sun"></a><h3>SUNDAY 8th OCTOBER<img src="../owo_logos/online_logotv&radio_line.gif"></h3><li><h3>Link - ITV, 10.15am</h3><ul><b>Sian Vasey</b> looks at how children's books deal with disability, plus ballroom dancing for wheelchair users.</ul><p><li><h3>Everyman - BBC1, 10.40pm</h3><ul><b>Everyob</b><br>Ten years on from the Church of Engliand's "Faith in the City" initiative to tackle inner city problems, this special programme confronts leading Christian voices with a nightmare vision of Britain - seen from the bottom of the social and economic ladder, where young people are trapped in a cycle of hopelessness, alienation, boredom and addiction.</ul><p><br><a name="mon"></a><h3>MONDAY 9th OCTOBER<img src="../owo_logos/online_logotv&radio_line.gif"></h3><li><h3>Cutting Edge - Ch 4, 9pm</h3><ul><b>Fighting for Breath</b><br>Filmed during this year's long, hot summer in Britain, tonight's documentary follows the lives of four seriously ill patients living in Birmingham, and reveals new research into the condition that links asthma with poverty.</ul><p><br><a name="tue"></a><h3>TUESDAY 10th OCTOBER<img src="../owo_logos/online_logotv&radio_line.gif"></h3><li><h3>The Sahara Project - Ch 4, 2.25am (Weds morning)</h3><ul>Third in an eight-part drama series about scientists seeking an alternative energy source for Europe.</ul><p><br><a name="wed"></a><h3>WEDNESDAY 11th OCTOBER<img src="../owo_logos/online_logotv&radio_line.gif"></h3><li><h3>Dispatches - Ch 4, 9pm</h3><ul>The acclaimed current affairs series, winner of a host of prestigious awards including the Royal Television Society's award for Best Current Affairs programme last year, returns for its ninth season, promising a series of incisive and topical investigative reports from Britain and around the world.</ul><p><li><h3>Under the Blue Flag - BBC World, 9.05pm  GMT</h3><ul><b>The Great Disaster</b> <br>The first in the four-part 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary series examining some of the themes that test the UN analyses the complex Rwandan emergency.

While Bewick and Crockett had not broken the law at that time, they were both punished for their actions by the General Medical Council. Neither can see anything wrong with what they did. Crockett asks what parent would not pay for a kidney if it would save his child's life, while Bewick asks why, if it is acceptable for the recipient to send the donor a thank-you card, or a present of a holiday, is it unacceptable to give cash?</ul><p><br><a name="fri"></a><h3>FRIDAY 24th NOVEMBER<img src="../owo_logos/online_logotv&radio_line.gif"></h3><li><h3>Children in Need - BBC1, 7pm</h3><ul>Pudsey's back with <b>Terry Wogan</b> to bring news of this year's fundraising extravaganza. <b>Sue Cook</b> takes a look at how your money is helping needy children, and <b>Gaby Roslin </b>presents <i>Celebrate Children, </i> a series of short films.</ul><p><li><h3>A Taste of Africa - Ch 4, 8pm</h3><ul><b>Tanzania</b><br><b>Dorinda</b> visits the Chagga people of Kilimanjaro where she cooks a four course meal with bananas in each course.</ul><p><br><a name="sat"></a><h3>SATURDAY 25th NOVEMBER<img src="../owo_logos/online_logotv&radio_line.gif"></h3><li><h3>Asia Two - BBC2, 10am<img src="../tvandradio/tvandradio_pix/whats_yes.gif"></h3><ul>A series of Asian cultural shows.<p><b>10am - Chanakya</b><br>Continuing the epic saga set in ancient India.

<I>La m&eacute;fiance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des Etats pr&eacute;dateurs
africains incite les donateurs &agrave; contourner l'&eacute;chelon
&eacute;tatique, au risque de se cantonner dans des actions locales.
Le d&eacute;veloppement ne passe-t-il pourtant pas aussi par un
v&eacute;ritable partenariat avec des gouvernements africains
r&eacute;nov&eacute;s ?</I>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Courrier de la Plan&egrave;te : Quel bilan faites-vous de l'aide
au d&eacute;veloppement de l'Afrique ?</B> 
<P>
<B>Mamadou Diouf : </B>Le continent africain a re&ccedil;u un
volume d'aide extraordinaire. Mais quand on rapproche les financements
per&ccedil;us des actions envisag&eacute;es et des r&eacute;sultats
obtenus, il est clair que l'on n'a pas atteint les objectifs globaux
qui avaient &eacute;t&eacute; fix&eacute;s. Les r&eacute;ussites
ne concernent que des actions tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;cises. On
peut d'ailleurs se demander si les interventions de coop&eacute;ration
ont &eacute;t&eacute; bien choisies. Des ann&eacute;es 1960 au
premier choc p&eacute;trolier, les pays donateurs n'ont pas eu
une approche &eacute;conomique de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement,
mais une approche morale : nous avons colonis&eacute; les pays
africains, qui sont &eacute;conomiquement faibles, nous devons
les aider &agrave; corriger cette faiblesse et leur donner un
nouveau d&eacute;part. C'&eacute;tait un discours excessivement
optimiste. Les pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s imaginaient que les
ressources consacr&eacute;es &agrave; l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
&eacute;taient intarissables et pourraient rapidement repr&eacute;senter
1 % du produit national brut. Dans la perspective d'un d&eacute;collage
en l'an 2000, on pensait qu'il fallait cr&eacute;er un cadre favorable
au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et que les questions
d'in&eacute;galit&eacute;s sociales et de d&eacute;mocratie se
r&eacute;gleraient ensuite d'elles-m&ecirc;mes. Dans cette optique,
l'aide a privil&eacute;gi&eacute; la formation des cadres, la
construction d'infrastructures et finalement le soutien des Etats,
de l'administration et des institutions. Elle n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute;
analys&eacute;e sous l'angle &eacute;conomique. On n'a pas pr&eacute;vu
qu'une partie de l'aide serait d&eacute;tourn&eacute;e.
<P>
<B>CdP : En quoi l'aide a-t-elle chang&eacute; de nature ?</B>
<P>
<B>M. D. : </B>La vision actuelle de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
est plus pratique. L'objectif est de renforcer la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile, de favoriser le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;,
de restaurer l'environnement. Les plans de rattrapage nationaux
sont abandonn&eacute;s. Mais surtout, les donateurs refusent d&eacute;sormais
de soutenir des dictatures. Auparavant, ils estimaient que la
d&eacute;mocratie viendrait apr&egrave;s le d&eacute;veloppement
; ils consid&egrave;rent aujourd'hui que les deux vont de pair.
Mais les donateurs ont sous-estim&eacute; la complexit&eacute;
des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s africaines, caract&eacute;ris&eacute;es
par un contraste entre la multiplicit&eacute; des enjeux politiques
et la faiblesse consid&eacute;rable des institutions.
<P>
<B>CdP : Comment expliquez-vous cette &eacute;volution ?</B> 
<P>
<B>M. D. : </B>Un facteur important de ce changement est la d&eacute;mocratisation
des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s occidentales depuis trente ans et leur
m&eacute;fiance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'Etat. Un nombre croissant
d'acteurs participent &agrave; la d&eacute;finition et &agrave;
l'utilisation des ressources publiques. Les opinions publiques
des pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s exigent aujourd'hui que les
programmes d'aide soient li&eacute;s au respect de certains crit&egrave;res
par les Etats b&eacute;n&eacute;ficaires : condition des femmes,
pr&eacute;servation de l'environnement, application des droits
de l'Homme, etc. Les Canadiens, par exemple, refusent de contribuer
&agrave; des projets dont 20 % au moins des financements ne sont
pas directement destin&eacute;s &agrave; des femmes. Un second
facteur est l'activit&eacute; des organisations non gouvernementales
(ONG), apparues d'abord dans les pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s,
puis plus r&eacute;cemment dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement.
Ces ONG ont acquis une capacit&eacute; &agrave; recueillir et
diffuser des informations, &agrave; capter des ressources et &agrave;
les utiliser sans passer par le canal des Etats. La coop&eacute;ration
n'est plus un t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te entre gouvernements
; les acteurs se sont beaucoup diversifi&eacute;s. Pour continuer
&agrave; recevoir une assistance financi&egrave;re, les gouvernements
africains ont d&ucirc; ainsi s'adapter &agrave; la sensibilisation
de l'opinion publique et accepter parfois les conditions impos&eacute;es
en &eacute;change de l'aide.
<P>
<B>CdP : La coop&eacute;ration pour le d&eacute;veloppement pourrait
donc d&eacute;sormais se passer de l'Etat ?</B> 
<P>
<B>M. D. : </B>On se trouve face &agrave; une contradiction. D'un
c&ocirc;t&eacute;, l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement exige de renforcer
la coordination de l'ensemble des interventions, t&acirc;che que
seul l'Etat est capable d'accomplir. De l'autre, elle impose de
se passer de l'Etat, qui s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; un
v&eacute;ritable pr&eacute;dateur de ressources aux d&eacute;pens
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et du secteur priv&eacute;.
Faut-il, &agrave; cause de l'&eacute;chec de la premi&egrave;re
g&eacute;n&eacute;ration de politiques d'aide, abandonner toute
approche globale du d&eacute;veloppement ? Les donateurs ont &eacute;t&eacute;
d&eacute;&ccedil;us par l'action des Etats africains. Constatant
qu'ils ne repr&eacute;sentent pas la soci&eacute;t&eacute; enti&egrave;re,
mais uniquement les groupes qui les ont accapar&eacute;s, ils
ont voulu s'adresser directement aux b&eacute;n&eacute;ficaires
de l'aide. D'o&ugrave; la croissance des ressources mises &agrave;
disposition des ONG. Aux Etats-Unis, dans une dizaine d'ann&eacute;es,
elles g&eacute;reront de mani&egrave;re autonome entre 40 et 60
% de l'aide. Ce faisant, les donateurs sont pass&eacute;s d'une
action macro-&eacute;conomique &agrave; des interventions micro-&eacute;conomiques.
A mon sens, en contournant totalement l'&eacute;chelon &eacute;tatique,
on risque de mener des politiques sectorielles de lutte contre
la pauvret&eacute; et non pas une politique d'ensemble d'aide
au d&eacute;veloppement. Par ailleurs, les donateurs estiment
indispensable que les populations s'approprient les projets de
coop&eacute;ration. Lorsqu'il s'agit de b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
tr&egrave;s isol&eacute;s, dans un espace g&eacute;ographique
r&eacute;duit, cela ne pose pas de probl&egrave;me particulier.
Mais d&egrave;s que l'on s'attaque &agrave; des probl&egrave;mes
collectifs, l'id&eacute;e d'appropriation pose la question de
la d&eacute;finition de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.
Or qui, sinon l'Etat, est susceptible d'agir au nom de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral ? C'est pourquoi, plut&ocirc;t que de tenter
de se passer de l'Etat, il vaut mieux l'aider &agrave; s'amender
et &agrave; jouer un r&ocirc;le plus positif.
<P>
<B>CdP : La multiplication des ONG au Nord comme au Sud ne constitue-t-elle
pas en fait un jeu de dupes, une partie des ONG d&eacute;pendant
directement des Etats &agrave; qui elles garantissent un certain
anonymat ?</B> 
<P>
<B>M. D. :</B> Je suis effectivement certain que plus les donateurs
dispenseront leur aide par le truchement des ONG, plus les Etats
africains cr&eacute;eront des ONG pour r&eacute;cup&eacute;rer
ces ressources. Les gouvernements sont des acteurs comme les autres,
capables d'inventer des strat&eacute;gies nouvelles pour s'adapter
au changement. Les structures &eacute;tatiques en Afrique sont
suffisamment solides pour surmonter des situations difficiles.
Les interlocuteurs restent les m&ecirc;mes, seules les institutions
changent.
<P>
<B>CdP : Dans ces conditions, l'aide n'est-elle pas contre-productive
? Ne vaut-il pas mieux la supprimer en &eacute;change d'une ouverture
des march&eacute;s du Nord, comme le r&eacute;clament l'Asie,
l'Am&eacute;rique latine ou le Maghreb ?</B> 
<P>
<B>M. D. : </B>On ne peut pas envisager de supprimer l'aide tant
que la question de la dette n'est pas r&eacute;gl&eacute;e. Les
deux probl&egrave;mes sont intrins&egrave;quement li&eacute;s.
Et m&ecirc;me si on annulait la dette, suspendre l'aide aurait
un co&ucirc;t humain et mat&eacute;riel extr&ecirc;mement &eacute;lev&eacute;.
Les Africains sont-ils pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; assumer cette responsabilit&eacute;
? Peuvent-ils se trouver une place dans le monde ? Le probl&egrave;me,
c'est l'absence de perspectives claires. Cela tient surtout aux
carences de la formation. Les Africains instruits sont nombreux,
mais leur &eacute;ducation est souvent totalement inadapt&eacute;e
aux besoins de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Elle ne leur permet pas
de comprendre les probl&egrave;mes de l'Afrique, de saisir sa
complexit&eacute; et de proposer des solutions internes. Or pour
construire l'avenir des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s africaines, il
faut puiser dans la tradition et non dans la pens&eacute;e moderne.
<P>
<B>CdP : Qu'est-ce que l'Afrique peut proposer aux pays donateurs
en &eacute;change du maintien de l'aide ?</B> 
<P>
<B>M. D. :</B> Dans la situation actuelle, la seule chose qu'elle
puisse offrir &agrave; l'Europe est une tentative de freiner les
flux migratoires en stabilisant les populations dans leur r&eacute;gion
d'origine. Mais une coop&eacute;raton fond&eacute;e sur des peurs
a peu de chances de durer. Je pense que cette question soul&egrave;ve
un faux probl&egrave;me. La coop&eacute;ration ne se pose pas
en termes de contrepartie. C'est justement ce qui la distingue
de l'&eacute;change &eacute;conomique. Si l'Afrique pouvait &eacute;changer
d'&eacute;gal &agrave; &eacute;gal avec l'Europe, elle n'aurait
plus besoin d'&ecirc;tre aid&eacute;e.

 <h1> ASIA-CHINA/DENG: Long Shadow Casts Over The East, West and South </h1>

<ADDRESS>   By Richard S. Ehrlich </ADDRESS>
<strong>BANGKOK, Feb 20 (IPS) - The world at large will be closely  
watching developments in the post-Deng era, but China's shadow  
cast longest across an Asian region with inextricable political,  
economic and cultural links to the world's most populous nation. </strong><P>
	The expected jockeying for political power in Beijing and even  
the manner in which the Communist Party lays to rest paramount  
leader Deng Xiaoping, will be closely followed from Taipei to the  
east Asia, to Hanoi in the south-east and Delhi in the south. <P>
	Deng, the architect of China's economic reforms launched in the  
late 1970s and early 1980s, died Wednesday from Parkinson's  
Disease at the age of 92. At the time of his death, he had handed  
over the reins of power to Jiang Zemin, but remained a stabilising  
factor in Communist China. <P>
	Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, will be wary  
that a power struggle could see Jiang trying to curry favour with  
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and hardliners in the Communist  
Party by resorting to aggression as opposed to negotiation in the  
stalemated reunification process. <P>
	Taiwan's own army was put on the alert Wednesday after news broke  
of Deng's death. Last year, in March, China's military staged a  
series of war games across the Taiwan Strait. <P>
	Other potential hotspots are on the Mainland itself, in western  
and north-west China, where calls for autonomous rule have till  
now been kept under the lid by a regime that tolerates no form of  
dissident behaviour. <P>
	Tibet's self-exiled Dalai Lama, for example, has often predicted  
a possible Soviet-style breakup of China after Deng's death. Any  
rupture in Beijing's control may force a loosening of China's grip  
on Lhasa, and pave the way for fuller autonomy for Tibetans. <P>
   ''Tibet is an occupied country,'' the Dalai Lama said last  
year. ''I cannot destroy this fact. But this does not mean that I  
am seeking independence. I am ready to work and live with the  
Chinese. So, I am seeking genuine self-rule.'' <P>
   The Dalai Lama's elder brother, Gyalo Thondup, began  
negotiating with Deng in 1979, resulting mostly in a stalemate. <P>
   Across the border in South and South-east Asia, the possibility  
that foreign relation and economic policies pursued during Deng's  
period at the helm, may be affected, will be of particular  
concern. <P>
	The army-backed junta in Burma (also known as Myanmar) has  
depended heavily upon Deng and other Chinese leaders for military  
aid, to ward off demands for democracy by Nobel Prize laureate  
Aung San Suu Kyi, who has the international community on her side. <P>
   Burma spent hundreds of millions of dollars during the 1990s,  
buying Chinese helicopter gunships, armoured vehicles, field guns,  
assault rifles and patrol boats, and will be hoping such powerful  
support from Beijing continues. <P>
   Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) political  
party will be hoping otherwise, particularly since Deng has also  
served as a ruthless model for Burma's military on how to crush  
domestic dissidents and international criticism -- yet still  
attract international investment. <P>
   Further east, in Vietnam, one of the world's last stable  
Communist regimes, a close eye will not only be kept on political  
developments in China, but as well as how Beijing disposes of  
Deng's corpse. <P>
   Vietnam's independence leader, Ho Chi Minh, is in a crystal  
sarcophagus in Hanoi. China duplicated that form of reverence and  
placed its former strongman, Mao Zedong, in a sarcophagus in  
Beijing. Both nations copied the technique from the way Moscow  
entombed Stalin's body. <P>
   The elderly communist leadership in Hanoi will thus now be  
scrutinizing Deng's funeral ceremony, and the resulting power  
shifts, for clues to how communist hierarchies should best deal  
with such transitions. <P>
   During the more than 1,000 years of relations between the  
Chinese and Vietnamese, the two nations have fought wars, became  
military allies, and invaded each other's territory. With both  
countries now hot on the economic reform trail, they have opened  
their borders to increased trade. <P>
   But they still eye each other with suspicion because both  
countries seek wider influence in South-east Asia and face an  
unresolved dispute over key islands in the South China Sea. A host  
of South-east Asian nations face similar territorial disputes. <P>
   In the South Asian context, there is the long-standing border  
dispute involving India. Some officials in New Delhi feared Deng  
was maneuvering China's navy to gain access to the Indian Ocean,  
via Burma's ports. As a result, India will be focusing on moves by  
China's military now that Deng is gone. <P>
   A chunk of previously held Indian territory, known as Aksai  
Chin, is also a coveted prize. Aksai Chin provides China with the  
only main highway directly linking troubled Tibet with  
independence-minded Xinjiang Province in north-west China, where  
Muslim Uighurs recently staged bloody protests against continued  
Chinese rule. <P>
   Thailand, meanwhile, has capitalist concerns about the post- 
Deng era. <P>
   Thailand's economy has suffered a melt-down in recent months,  
with a plunging stock market, slumping real estate sector,  
flattening export figures, and a government nervously denying that  
the Thai currency may have to be devalued. <P>
   Many Thai corporations have large investments in China, and  
will be hoping that Deng's death will not result in any woes for  
Thai businessmen. <P>
	Many Thais are actually Thai-Chinese, and have recently begun  
visiting southern and coastal China to see the places their  
ancestors fled. <P>
   A surge in ''Chinese pride'' has recently swept middle and  
upper class Thai society, which has traditionally kept mum about  
such ethnic diversity because Thailand is obsessed with projecting  
an image of social conformity. <P>
   Joint-projects between China and other South-east Asian  
nations, including Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the  
Philippines, will also be tracked to see if the post-Deng  
investment climate causes delays, cutbacks, or other forms of  
hostility to foreign linked deals. <P>
   Those nations also have large, commercially successful, Chinese  
communities who are alternately suspected of being pro-communist,  
pro-China, or, ironically, too pro-capitalist.

<HR>
<I>Si l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide est &agrave; l'odre du jour
de la coop&eacute;ration, les crit&egrave;res d'&eacute;valuation
divergent entre bailleurs de fonds et b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
Renforcer la concertation devient donc une urgence</I>.
<HR>
<P>
Avec la fin de la guerre froide et le souci croissant de rigueur
budg&eacute;taire dans les pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s, les
ann&eacute;es 1990 marquent un tournant pour l'aide &agrave; l'Afrique.
Auparavant, beaucoup d'actions men&eacute;es au nom de l'aide
au d&eacute;veloppement relevaient essentiellement de pr&eacute;occupations
g&eacute;opolitiques, tr&egrave;s &eacute;loign&eacute;es des
questions fondamentales de d&eacute;veloppement. Ces motivations
existent peut-&ecirc;tre encore dans le contexte actuel, mais
devraient rev&ecirc;tir un caract&egrave;re moins primordial.
<P>
La r&eacute;flexion sur l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide publique
au d&eacute;veloppement (APD) a longtemps privil&eacute;gi&eacute;
le point de vue des bailleurs de fonds. Dans leur optique, l'aide
&eacute;tait efficace quand elle remplissait son objectif ou contrat
initial en fonction de crit&egrave;res principalement quantitatifs.
Les analyses actuelles cherchent d&eacute;sormais &agrave; se
placer sous l'angle des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires de l'aide.
Elles s'int&eacute;ressent &agrave; la vision que les diff&eacute;rents
partenaires (&Eacute;tat, organisations non gouvernementales,
entreprises, commer&ccedil;ants, etc.) ont de l'APD et de la nature
de leurs relations avec les organismes donateurs. Simple en apparence,
cette d&eacute;marche soul&egrave;ve en r&eacute;alit&eacute;
un certain nombre d'interrogations qui compliquent le champ de
la r&eacute;flexion. Qui sont les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
de l'aide ? Quels crit&egrave;res permettent de distinguer une
aide efficace d'une intervention inefficace ? Enfin, pourquoi
certaines actions sont-elles plus efficaces que d'autres ?
<P>
La fili&egrave;re de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement rassemble
plusieurs cat&eacute;gories d'acteurs, du bailleur de fonds au
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire final en passant par le ma&icirc;tre
d'ouvraget et le ma&icirc;tre d'oeuvret. Les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
eux-m&ecirc;mes forment un ensemble h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;ne.
Il peut s'agir du consommateur, du producteur ou du commer&ccedil;ant
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant par exemple d'une mesure de lib&eacute;ralisation,
ou encore du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire non vis&eacute; au d&eacute;marrage
du projet. Ainsi, dans le cas de l'aide alimentaire vendue sur
le march&eacute; alors qu'elle devait &agrave; l'origine &ecirc;tre
distribu&eacute;e gratuitement, le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
devient le &#171;client&#187;. Ces destinataires de l'aide disposent
d'un pouvoir de n&eacute;gociation plus ou moins affirm&eacute;
vis-&agrave;-vis des donateurs. Conna&icirc;tre la position de
chacun d'entre eux permet de mieux comprendre les causes des &eacute;checs
et des succ&egrave;s des op&eacute;rations de coop&eacute;ration.
<P>
<H3>Des crit&egrave;res relatifs</H3>
<P>
Donateurs et b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires n'&eacute;valuent pas
l'efficacit&eacute; d'une action selon les m&ecirc;mes crit&egrave;res.
Par exemple, dans l'optique du donateur, la m&eacute;canisation
des exploitations agricoles permet d'intensifier l'agriculture
et d'encourager ainsi le d&eacute;veloppement de la production
tout en assurant la fertilit&eacute; des sols. Le producteur,
en revanche, peut consid&eacute;rer que les capacit&eacute;s de
production suppl&eacute;mentaires fournies par le tracteur lui
permettent d'accro&icirc;tre la surface cultiv&eacute;e, m&ecirc;me
si cette course &agrave; la terre provoque &agrave; terme une
grave d&eacute;gradation des sols. De la m&ecirc;me mani&egrave;re,
l'aide &agrave; l'installation d'infrastructures hydrauliques
dans des villages peut avoir un effet positif sur la commercialisation
des produits agricoles, alors que le donateur ne recherchait pas
explicitement cet effet. Pour d&eacute;terminer la qualit&eacute;
d'un projet selon le point de vue du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire,
prendre en compte les diff&eacute;rentes attentes des acteurs
de la fili&egrave;re aide est donc n&eacute;cessaire.
<P>
L'efficacit&eacute; d'un programme d'aide d&eacute;pend de multiples
facteurs. Le degr&eacute; d'appropriation du projet (<I>ownership</I>)
par les intervenants de la fili&egrave;re de l'aide est une cause
importante de r&eacute;ussite ou d'&eacute;chec des programmes.
La p&eacute;rennit&eacute; du projet suppose que le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
prenne en charge le suivi financier de l'activit&eacute; et que
les acteurs directement concern&eacute;s aient une certaine responsabilit&eacute;
dans le projet. L'id&eacute;e de p&eacute;rennit&eacute; ne signifie
pas accoutumance au soutien ext&eacute;rieur, mais &agrave; l'inverse
prise en charge du programme par les nationaux apr&egrave;s le
d&eacute;part du bailleur de fonds. Encore faut-il que son d&eacute;sengagement
soit annonc&eacute; suffisamment t&ocirc;t et que la faiblesse
des ressources financi&egrave;res de l'&Eacute;tat n'entrave pas
la poursuite du projet. Prenons le cas des syst&egrave;mes d'information
sur la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire au Sahel : la continuit&eacute;
est assur&eacute;e sur le plan des comp&eacute;tences techniques
locales, mais sur le plan financier, en revanche, l'&Eacute;tat
a beaucoup de mal &agrave; prendre la rel&egrave;ve des bailleurs
de fonds. Outre la question financi&egrave;re, la p&eacute;rennit&eacute;
de l'activit&eacute; est ainsi li&eacute;e aux &#171;effets d'apprentissage&#187;
: si l'aide conduit par exemple les techniciens locaux &agrave;
&eacute;laborer eux-m&ecirc;mes des comptes nationaux, &agrave;
d&eacute;velopper une capacit&eacute; d'analyse autonome, les
autorit&eacute;s politiques nationales disposent alors de meilleures
bases de n&eacute;gociation avec les bailleurs de fonds.
<P>
L'appropriation signifie en outre que les acteurs locaux, notamment
les administrations, int&eacute;riorisent les projets. Trop souvent,
ceux-ci r&eacute;pondent avant tout aux pr&eacute;occupations
des donateurs, d'o&ugrave; le manque de motivation des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
et la faible efficacit&eacute; des programmes d'aide. A ce titre,
la phase de conception d'un projet est &eacute;clairante. L'efficacit&eacute;
de l'aide peut &ecirc;tre compromise par l'absence de dialogue
constructif entre donateurs et b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires. Le
mode des relations est parfois celui de la r&eacute;crimination
mutuelle, comme dans le cadre des programmes d'ajustement structurel
(PAS). Les gouvernements se plaignent du poids excessif de la
conditionnalit&eacute; et du manque de coordination entre donateurs
; les bailleurs de fonds d&eacute;noncent le manque de parole
des pouvoirs publics et leurs d&eacute;faillances qui les condamnent
presque &agrave; intervenir davantage.
<P>
Le succ&egrave;s de l'aide tient &eacute;galement &agrave; la
qualit&eacute; de l'assistance technique. Cette &eacute;vidence
acquiert une force croissante au moment o&ugrave; les donateurs
cherchent &agrave; am&eacute;liorer l'action de l'&Eacute;tat
en r&eacute;formant les administrations &eacute;conomiques et
financi&egrave;res. Les responsables nationaux sont en effet sensibles
&agrave; la comp&eacute;tence du conseiller technique, &agrave;
sa capacit&eacute; d'adaptation et d'&eacute;coute des besoins
du pays.
<P>
<H3>Aider un peuple malgr&eacute; lui ?</H3>
<P>
L'aide est &eacute;galement plus efficace lorsqu'elle r&eacute;pond
&agrave; une demande claire des responsables politiques. Au Burkina
Faso, par exemple, l'Institut de la statistique produit des informations
&eacute;conomiques de qualit&eacute; car il existe une demande
forte &eacute;manant de son minist&egrave;re de tutelle. L'assistance
technique et les outils de pr&eacute;vision financ&eacute;s par
les donateurs se r&eacute;v&egrave;lent dans un tel cas d'autant
plus efficaces. Tant qu'un projet n'est pas correctement ins&eacute;r&eacute;
dans l'administration, ses chances de succ&egrave;s sont faibles.
<P>
L'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide peut &ecirc;tre entrav&eacute;e
par des objectifs initiaux contradictoires. Ainsi, les PAS cherchent
&agrave; r&eacute;duire les d&eacute;penses budg&eacute;taires
gr&acirc;ce notamment &agrave; la suppression des subventions
aux engrais ; or cette mesure va &agrave; l'encontre d'un autre
objectif initial qui est d'encourager l'intensification de l'agriculture.
<P>
Les projets sont &eacute;galement plus &agrave; m&ecirc;me de
r&eacute;ussir lorsque les acteurs de la fili&egrave;re peuvent
les contr&ocirc;ler et les &eacute;valuer, lorsqu'on peut les
adapter aux changements et les modifier en fonction des erreurs
pass&eacute;es. Au Burkina Faso, on est ainsi pass&eacute; de
vastes projets mis en oeuvre dans le cadre de l'am&eacute;nagement
des vall&eacute;es des Volta &agrave; des projets plus modestes.
Il est en revanche d&eacute;solant de voir des projets dont l'inefficacit&eacute;
est manifeste &ecirc;tre reproduits dans diff&eacute;rents pays.
C'est le cas des programmes d'appui aux petites entreprises en
Afrique ; toutes les &eacute;valuations concluent &agrave; l'inefficacit&eacute;
d'un soutien financier sous forme d'octroi de cr&eacute;dits,
mais les bailleurs et les &Eacute;tats persistent &agrave; accorder
ce type d'aide. Notons d'ailleurs que peu de gouvernements se
sont dot&eacute;s de m&eacute;canismes efficaces d'&eacute;valuation
<I>ex-post</I> des projets d'aide, s'en remettant plut&ocirc;t
aux analyses faites par les donateurs.
<P>
L'&eacute;volution du contexte dans lequel un projet est mis en
oeuvre exerce une influence suppl&eacute;mentaire sur son efficacit&eacute;.
La rentabilit&eacute; d'un programme de motorisation des exploitations
agricoles est ainsi tributaire des prix de vente des produits
de ces exploitations. Sym&eacute;triquement, un projet d'am&eacute;lioration
des recettes fiscales peut &eacute;chouer en raison de la situation
&eacute;conomique et non &agrave; cause de sa mauvaise conception
initiale.
<P>
Concernant le r&ocirc;le des ONG, le d&eacute;bat reste ouvert.
Sont-elles r&eacute;ellement plus efficaces que les &Eacute;tats
? Force est de constater qu'il ne peut y avoir de r&eacute;ponse
unique et tranch&eacute;e. Certaines actions mises en oeuvre par
des ONG ont des effets catastrophiques, &agrave; cause de leur
manque de professionnalisme, de l'opacit&eacute; de la gestion,
etc. D'autres, &agrave; l'inverse, sont positives car les ONG
sont plus proches des populations locales et r&eacute;pondent
&agrave; leurs besoins r&eacute;els.
<P>
Prendre en compte les effets indirects d'une intervention permet
&eacute;galement d'accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&eacute;. On sait
assez bien &eacute;valuer les effets d'un projet sur les acteurs
de la fili&egrave;re &eacute;conomique. En revanche, peu d'analyses
permettent de calculer l'impact d'un programme sur l'environnement
socio-&eacute;conomique, d'identifier les externalit&eacute;s
positives ou n&eacute;gatives. Par exemple, la r&eacute;novation
d'une route, dont le but premier est de favoriser l'&eacute;coulement
d'une mati&egrave;re premi&egrave;re, peut avoir des effets indirects
sur le commerce r&eacute;gional, l'implantation d'autres activit&eacute;s
&eacute;conomiques, etc.
<P>
<H3>Le risque d'effets pervers</H3>
<P>
Dans la m&ecirc;me logique, tout projet devrait tenir compte des
effets pervers qu'il peut induire. L'aide peut modifier le rapport
des prix de certains biens (comme le prix des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales
import&eacute;es par rapport au cours des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales
locales) ou de certains facteurs de production (r&eacute;mun&eacute;ration
trop &eacute;lev&eacute;e du personnel local impliqu&eacute; dans
un programme par rapport &agrave; celle pratiqu&eacute;e dans
l'administration). Elle peut &eacute;galement accro&icirc;tre
l'accoutumance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de produits fournis par
l'&eacute;tranger ou la d&eacute;pendance vis-&agrave;-vis des
financements, du personnel, etc. d'origine externe.
<P>
Pour conclure ce tour d'horizon de l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide,
retenons plusieurs id&eacute;es. Tout d'abord, il convient d'&eacute;viter
les simplifications outranci&egrave;res sur les causes de l'efficacit&eacute;
ou de l'inefficacit&eacute;. La r&eacute;ussite ou l'&eacute;chec
d'un projet ne peuvent &ecirc;tre &eacute;clair&eacute;s que par
un faisceau de questions. La qualit&eacute; de la relation et
de la coordination entre le donateur et le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
reste une cl&eacute; du succ&egrave;s d'un programme. Malheureusement,
la concertation demeure limit&eacute;e et artificielle. Une approche
positive des programmes d'aide exige au contraire que les bailleurs
de fonds et les administrations nationales se posent conjointement
les questions fondamentales. Dans le contexte actuel de d&eacute;sengagement
des donateurs, cela contribuerait certainement &agrave; am&eacute;liorer
l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide.

NGOs lobby IGC on development issues</h2>
<h4>by <i>Debra Percival</i>
<p>
News item from <i>The Courier ACP-EU</i><br>No. 156, March-April 1996</h4>

<hr>
The Brussels-based Liaison Committee of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), the European umbrella body for development NGOs, is lobbying for greater 'coherence' between the EU's development policy and other policies, such as agriculture. This is one of the key elements in a statement* drawn up for the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) of EU leaders.
<p>
It is widely acknowledged that significant reforms of EU institutions will be on the agenda of the IGC. The NGOs, however, are fearful that development policy may be left out of the discussions. It is worth recalling that the Maastricht Treaty introduced reforms in this area. Title XVII, on development cooperation included commitments to promote:
<p>
- the sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them;
- the smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy;
- the campaign against poverty in the developing countries.
<p>
But the NGOs regret that Maastricht has 'not led to any decisive improvement in the impact of the Union's development programmes on the intended beneficiaries.' An example of such lack of coherence, they say, is the harm done to local producers by 'dumping' of EU subsidised beef on West African markets.
<p>
The ICG, they argue, provides an opportunity to place relations with the developing world 'nearer the centre of Europe's legal and institutional foundations'. They add that it could be used to eliminate the 'contradictions' arising from practices in other important fields of Union policy, which, they insist, undermine the effect of agreed and established development policy. The NGOs believe that it is important to reiterate the basics of Community development policy at the level of the European institutions. This is necessary, they argue, to avoid a further 'shift' in priorities towards the Commonwealth of Independent States, Central and Eastern Europe (where some countries are already candidates for EU accession) and the Mediterranean.
<p>
The report points out that 'many of the (Union's) potential new members currently have little involvement in development cooperation focused on Africa, Asia and Latin America' and that they are 'mainly concerned with their own economic transformation.'
<p>
The paper's main recommendation to the IGC is that there should be a strengthening of Title XVII of the EC Treaty to include references to women and development, 'partnership', the budgetisation of Lom&#233;, emergency aid, rehabilitation and disaster preparedness, and coordination with international bodies.
<p>
It also calls for better conflict prevention, with the creation of a 'conflict planning cell' and the implmentation of an arms export policy.' The first step towards an effective policy in respect of the arms trade would be for the EU Council of Ministers to make export controls subject to a joint action procedure, with the adoption of an enforceable code of conduct involving 'the highest levels of control.'
<p>
The text underlines the need for coherence, not only with agriculture policy, but also in the context of areas such as immigration and asylum policy. It recommends a progressive transfer of competences to the Union in the latter fields with a view to establishing common policies that are based on realistic limits and humanitarian considerations.
<p>
European development NGOs will hold a think-tank on scenarios for development policy and the IGC on April 19-20, directly following their annual general assembly. A Summit of EU leaders to launch the IGC will be held in Turin, Italy, on March 29 1996.

<h2 align=center> ACTIONAID Ireland</h2>


ACTIONAID Ireland was established in 1983 as an independent Irish non-governmental development
organisation (NGDO). It supports long-term community development work through operational partners in
Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda and is affiliated to ACTIONAID in the UK.
<p>

The money donated by individual supporters, the Irish government and the European Union funds vital
work in education, health, water, food security, community organisation and income generation. 
<p>

ACTIONAID Ireland also aims to increase awareness of the poor in the developing world through
development education in Ireland. Two resources have been produced to this end (with the assistance
of the National Committee for Development Education):
<p>

<ul><li>The Transition Year Option Guide to Kenya explores the cultures of Kenya and Ireland.

<li>Kids Like Us looks at the lives of Kenyan and Irish children through a cross-curricular book,
photopack and culture kit. 
	Suitable for 10-13 year-olds.
</ul>
Influencing key decision-makers at national and international fora to take account of the needs of
those in poverty forms another part of ACTIONAID Ireland's work. The organisation has consultative
status (category two) with the Economic and Social Council in the United Nations.

Italy: orientations for a new development cooperation policy</h2>

<hr>
In 1995, the Italian Government updated the aims of its development policy to take account of its commitments under the Maastricht Treaty, international trends, the evolution of Italy's own foreign relations and the domestic budget situation.
<p>
The underlying goals of the country's cooperation policy remain largely unchanged. These include participating in international efforts aimed at helping developing countries, contributing to the fight against poverty and pursuing humanitarian objectives. The Italian authorities stress that budget restraints at home should not interfere with the pursuit of these goals although they are looking to integrate their activities more closely with those of the broader international community. Understandably they are also keen to focus on countries or regions whose situation may impact directly on Italy's own security. In this regard, they plan to concentrate their efforts in defined geographical areas which include the Horn of Africa, Southern Africa, ex-Yugoslavia, Albania and the eastern Mediterranean.
<p>
Italy's new emphasis on coordination and complementarity within the EU (and indeed with other donors), is very much in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty on European Union. So too is its express desire to improve the transparency and efficiency of the aid that it makes available. In this context, the government is updating its procedures for identifying and implementing development initiatives - the latter to include a 'project cycle' model setting out the different phases for correct management.
<p>
In concrete terms, the Italian authorities plan to focus their support on a number of key areas namely, environmental protection, democraphic stabilisation, regional integration, education, the fight against drugs/organised crime and the fight against AIDS.

<H3>La plate-forme autrichienne du Comit&#233; de liaison ONGD-UE se pr&#233;sente</H3>

<P>

<HR>

<P>

Peu apr&#232;s l&#146;adh&#233;sion de l&#146;Autriche &#224; l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne le 1er janvier 1995, la plate-forme UE des organisations non-gouvernementales de d&#233;veloppement autrichiennes (ONGD) a &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233;e. A cette &#233;poque, les ONGD autrichiennes les plus importantes s&#146;&#233;taient d&#233;j&#224; unies dans le cadre d&#146;un groupe de travail de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement efficace, l&#146;AGEZ. 

<p>

C&#146;est ce groupe qui prit l&#146;initiative qui d&#233;boucha sur la fondation d&#146;une plate-forme UE afin de jeter les fondements d&#146;une repr&#233;sentation d&#233;mocrati-quement reconnue des ONG autrichiennes au sein du Comit&#233; de liaison &#224; Bruxelles.

<p>

Au d&#233;but, tout le monde &#233;tait vivement int&#233;ress&#233; par cette plate-forme UE, en particulier les ONG de taille plus r&#233;duite qui n&#146;&#233;taient pas membres de l&#146;AGEZ et esp&#233;raient ainsi obtenir un acc&#232;s ais&#233; aux fonds de l&#146;UE. Mais ce ne fut pas la seule raison qui poussa plus de 30 organisations &#224; rejoindre la plate-forme UE. Il y avait &#233;galement des consid&#233;rations relatives &#224; la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, mais elles se sont transform&#233;es en frustration, partiellement en raison du fait que 

l&#146;acc&#232;s aux &#147;fonds du grand Bruxelles&#148; s&#146;est av&#233;r&#233; beaucoup plus difficile que ce qui &#233;tait initialement escompt&#233;. Certaines organisations ont quitt&#233; la plate-forme UE, d&#146;autres en feront probablement autant d&#232;s l&#146;instant o&#249; le cofinancement du Comit&#233; de liaison les obligera &#224; verser des contributions beaucoup plus &#233;lev&#233;es &#224; leur plate-forme nationale.

<p>

Toutefois, en d&#233;pit de ce changement d&#146;attitude, il n&#146;en demeure pas moins que, au cours des deux derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, la plate-forme UE s&#146;est av&#233;r&#233;e &#234;tre un instrument sp&#233;cialis&#233; suppl&#233;mentaire plut&#244;t utile pour traiter les questions de d&#233;veloppement europ&#233;ennes. L&#146;intention n&#146;a jamais &#233;t&#233; de cr&#233;er une nouvelle structure repr&#233;sentative des ONG parall&#232;le &#224; l&#146;AGEZ, mais de travailler en &#233;troite collaboration avec l&#146;AGEZ dans le domaine de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement europ&#233;enne et dans leurs t&#226;ches repr&#233;sentatives respectives tout en limitant autant que possible les frais administratifs. Par cons&#233;quent, la plate-forme UE ne dispose d&#146;aucun secr&#233;tariat ni d&#146;aucune autre structure administrative permanente.



<H3>Mode d'organisation</H3>



L&#146;assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale des plates-formes se compose de quelque 30 organisations membres qui se r&#233;unissent deux ou trois fois par an. L&#146;assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale &#233;lit un groupe de travail compos&#233; des six d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s du Comit&#233; de liaison, des repr&#233;sentants des groupes de travail permanents du CL et du secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral de l&#146;AGEZ. Ce groupe se r&#233;unit tous les deux ou trois mois.

<p>

La plus grande partie du travail de la plate-forme UE est accomplie par les membres du groupe de travail et leurs organisations en collaboration avec le secr&#233;tariat de l&#146;AGEZ. C&#146;est ce qui fait &#224; la fois la force et la faiblesse de la plate-forme autrichienne. Dans ce mode de travail d&#233;centralis&#233;, de nombreuses questions relatives &#224; la politique de d&#233;veloppement europ&#233;enne sont trait&#233;es sur une base socio-politique beaucoup plus large et par un plus grand nombre d&#146;ONG que ce qui se passerait si un seul secr&#233;tariat propre &#224; la plate-forme s&#146;acquittait de cette t&#226;che.

<p>

La plate-forme UE a donc confi&#233; toutes les questions relatives au d&#233;bat sur la politique du d&#233;veloppement &#224; un groupe de travail sp&#233;cialis&#233; de l&#146;AGEZ.

<p>

La documentation compl&#232;te engendr&#233;e par cette collaboration avec l&#146;UE est soigneusement compil&#233;e par la Fondation autrichienne pour la recherche au d&#233;veloppement (OFSE, une organisation membre de la plate-forme), et repr&#233;sente le plus important et le plus grand centre de documentation sur la politique de d&#233;veloppement.



<H3>Relations avec les institutions gouvernementales</H3>



La coop&#233;ration avec les minist&#232;res autrichiens a toujours &#233;t&#233; excellente et les ONG autrichiennes, ainsi que de nombreux membres de la plate-forme UE, ont travaill&#233; en coop&#233;ration &#233;troite avec l&#146;Etat autrichien dans le domaine de la mise en oeuvre des projets. Etant donn&#233; qu&#146;il n&#146;existe en Autriche aucune institution gouvernementale officielle charg&#233;e de la mise en oeuvre des projets, les ONG et d&#146;autres institutions non-gouvernementales (des entreprises priv&#233;es, par exemple) assument de nombreuses t&#226;ches dans le cadre de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement officielle et sont &#233;galement financ&#233;es par l&#146;Etat autrichien.

<p>

La proportion &#233;lev&#233;e de fonds publics accord&#233;s &#224; ces organisations, qui sont &#233;quip&#233;es de mani&#232;re professionnelle en ce qui concerne la mise en oeuvre des projets, constitue d&#233;sormais un obstacle au cofinancement de l&#146;UE, &#233;tant donn&#233; que nombre d&#146;entre elles ne disposent pas de ressources propres. Au cours de la derni&#232;re d&#233;cennie, elles n&#146;ont pas eu besoin d&#146;un financement sur la base de ressources propres &#233;tant donn&#233; qu&#146;elles pouvaient compter sur le financement public. C&#146;est pourquoi, certaines ONGD autrichiennes ne r&#233;pondent pas &#224; tous les crit&#232;res qui sont actuellement &#233;tablis par le Comit&#233; 

de liaison pour d&#233;finir une ONGD.



<H3>Une approche critique</H3>



Au cours des deux derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, les ONGD autrichiennes ont &#233;t&#233; vivement encourag&#233;es par l&#146;adh&#233;sion autrichienne &#224; l&#146;UE et la coop&#233;ration &#233;troite que cela a engendr&#233; avec le Comit&#233; de liaison. Cela a permis une meilleure compr&#233;hension du fonctionnement d&#146;une ONG et a d&#233;bouch&#233; sur de nouvelles mani&#232;res de g&#233;rer et d&#146;alimenter le d&#233;bat en mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement (en particulier sur la toile de fond de la Conf&#233;rence intergouvernementale), ce qui &#233;tait &#233;galement un des objectifs principaux de la plate-forme UE en 1996. En 1997, elle s&#146;int&#233;ressera principalement aux probl&#232;mes de Lom&#233;, un nouveau sujet sur lequel l&#146;Autriche va se pencher.

<p>

La discussion interne concernant la fonction et les t&#226;ches du Comit&#233; de liaison &#224; Bruxelles et le r&#244;le &#224; jouer par les plates-formes nationales, ainsi que la mani&#232;re de coop&#233;rer se poursuivra certainement en 1997. En qualit&#233; de nouveau membre de l&#146;UE, l&#146;Autriche se posera probablement davantage de questions que d&#146;autres pays concernant l&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t et la n&#233;cessit&#233; d&#146;avoir l&#146;une ou l&#146;autre institution europ&#233;enne &#233;tant donn&#233; que, jusqu&#146;&#224; pr&#233;sent, nous nous &#233;tions plut&#244;t bien d&#233;brouill&#233;s sans &#147;Bruxelles&#148;.

<p>

Ceci ne signifie pas pour autant qu&#146;on remet en question l&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t de l&#146;int&#233;gration europ&#233;enne en tant que telle, mais qu&#146;on s&#146;interroge sur certaines d&#233;formations et certains effets secondaires que les Etats membres traditionnels consid&#232;rent comme normaux. Les ONGD autrichiennes ont l&#146;intention d&#146;adopter comme principe de base une approche critique des structures existantes, y compris dans le cadre de leur coop&#233;ration avec le Comit&#233; de liaison.

<P>
L&#146;aide au d&eacute;veloppement est aujourd&#146;hui &agrave;
un tournant de son histoire. Elle est non seulement contest&eacute;e
par certains <I>lobbies </I>occidentaux parce qu&#146;elle favorise
l&#146;&eacute;mergence de nouveaux concurrents dans les pays
en d&eacute;veloppement, mais aussi par de larges fractions des
opinions publiques, qui jugent l&#146;aide inefficace &agrave;
l&#146;aune de la violence des guerres civiles qui s&#146;&eacute;talent
sur le petit &eacute;cran. En Asie et en Am&eacute;rique latine,
les investissements priv&eacute;s ont d&eacute;j&agrave; pris
le pas sur l&#146;aide. L&#146;Afrique devient le principal continent
sur lequel se concentre l&#146;aide publique et non gouvernementale.
De leur c&ocirc;t&eacute;, les pays d&#146;Europe centrale et
orientale tout comme les pays m&eacute;diterran&eacute;ens r&eacute;clament
l&#146;ouverture des march&eacute;s des pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s
plut&ocirc;t qu&#146;une aide financi&egrave;re.
<P>
Alors qu&#146;elle pourrait constituer un facteur d&#146;int&eacute;gration
mondiale, de d&eacute;veloppement des solidarit&eacute;s et d&#146;enrichissement
culturel, l&#146;aide est v&eacute;cue par une part croissante
des citoyens du Nord comme un complice de la d&eacute;sagr&eacute;gation
de leur propre soci&eacute;t&eacute;. La liaison abusive &eacute;tablie
entre d&eacute;localisations industrielles et croissance du ch&ocirc;mage
et de l&#146;exclusion conduit &agrave; des strat&eacute;gies
de repli et alimente l&#146;&eacute;go&iuml;sme et les nationalismes&#160;:
<I>again</I> la Corr&egrave;ze avant le Zamb&egrave;ze&#160;!
<P>
La multiplication des acteurs de la coop&eacute;ration internationale
(organisations non gouvernementales, syndicats, entreprises, etc.)
est de ce point de vue une r&eacute;ponse encourageante. Elle
permet aux citoyens engag&eacute;s de participer davantage au
d&eacute;bat et &agrave; l&#146;action internationale. Cette diversit&eacute;
d&#146;acteurs pourra-t-elle favoriser l&#146;&eacute;mergence
d&#146;un pacte international de coop&eacute;ration&#160;? Les
t&acirc;ches sont immenses. Il faut appuyer la d&eacute;mocratisation
en profondeur dans les pays du Sud et d&eacute;velopper les institutions
locales et nationales de m&eacute;diation. La n&eacute;gociation
avec des &Eacute;tats et des institutions internationales en mal
de perspectives est en effet la cl&eacute; du succ&egrave;s de
la coop&eacute;ration.
<P>
La transparence et la d&eacute;mocratisation de l&#146;aide, qu&#146;elle
soit publique ou priv&eacute;e, la clarification des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
et des acteurs de la coop&eacute;ration sont des conditions n&eacute;cessaires
pour r&eacute;habiliter la coop&eacute;ration internationale.
Le d&eacute;veloppement des solidarit&eacute;s impose de revoir
la grille de lecture des transformations qui affectent toutes
les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s. D&eacute;sormais, les Nords et les
Suds sont partout. Alors que les strat&eacute;gies de d&eacute;connexion
sont aussi illusoires que l&#146;ultra lib&eacute;ralisme, il
est indispensable d&#146;&eacute;laborer de nouvelles r&egrave;gles
du jeu et de clarifier les responsabilit&eacute;s respectives
des acteurs locaux, nationaux et internationaux. L&#146;aide peut
&ecirc;tre un instrument de ce nouveau dialogue mondial.

<h4>par <i>Simon Horner</i>

<hr>
En 1995, le gouvernement italien a &#233;t&#233; amen&#233; &#224; red&#233;finir les objectifs de sa politique de d&#233;veloppement pour tenir compte des obligations qui lui sont faites par le Trait&#233; de Maastricht, des tendances internationales, de l'&#233;volution de sa propre politique &#233;trang&#232;re ainsi que de la situation budg&#233;taire int&#233;rieure.
<p>
Les objectifs de cette politique restent  cependant largement inchang&#233;s et pr&#233;voient toujours  la participation de l'Italie aux efforts internationaux d'aide en faveur des pays en d&#233;veloppement, &#224; la lutte contre la pauvret&#233; et &#224; la poursuite de l'assistance humanitaire.  Les Autorit&#233;s italiennes ont indiqu&#233; que les restrictions budg&#233;taires int&#233;rieures n'auront pas d'effet sur la politique de coop&#233;ration, m&ecirc;me si un effort d'int&#233;gration  des activit&#233;s de l'aide italienne dans le contexte plus large des actions de la communaut&#233; internationale sera certainement entrepris.  Il va de soi &#233;galement  que l'Italie cherchera &#224; cibler ses actions sur des pays ou r&#233;gions dont la situation peut avoir un impact direct sur sa propre s&#233;curit&#233;.  Dans cette optique, les Autorit&#233;s italiennes ont l'intention de concentrer leurs efforts sur des aires g&#233;ographiques d&#233;finies comme la Corne de l'Afrique, l'Afrique australe, l'ex-Yougoslavie, l'Albanie et l'est de la M&#233;diterran&#233;e.
<p>
L'accent nouveau mis par l'Italie sur la coordination et la compl&#233;mentarit&#233; &#224; l'int&#233;rieur de l'UE (et &#233;galement avec d'autres donneurs) va r&#233;solument dans le sens de l'esprit du Trait&#233; sur l'Union europ&#233;enne.  De m&ecirc;me que son souci explicite d'am&#233;liorer la transparence et l'efficacit&#233; de l'aide.  Dans ce contexte, le gouvernement est en train d'ajuster les proc&#233;dures d'identification et de mise en oeuvre des projets de d&#233;veloppement, de mani&#232;re &#224; y ins&#233;rer un mod&#232;le de "cycle de projet"  d&#233;crivant les diff&#233;rentes phases d'une gestion ad&#233;quate.
<p>
Les Autorit&#233;s italiennes sont, par ailleurs, d&#233;termin&#233;es &#224;  orienter leur aide au d&#233;veloppement vers un certain nombre de domaines cl&#233;s comme la protection de l'environnement, la politique d&#233;mographique, l'int&#233;gration r&#233;gionale, l'&#233;ducation, la lutte contre la drogue et le crime organis&#233; et la pr&#233;vention du Sida.

<h2>Aiding the Earth</h2>
<h3>Rio to Reality</h3><p>


The Western Ghats, a chain of forested hills in Karnataka, south-western India, are an ecosystem under stress. They have been used for wood and other forest products. This has left them degraded and over the years they have become less able to meet the needs of local people or to provide a home to wildlife. A £25 million ODA project is helping the Indian government to establish new ways of managing the forest, emphasising greater participation from everyone involved, from state officials to village women who gather firewood. This has led to a quiet revolution in the hills. Forest rangers who once acted as forest police now work with villagers to plan and manage the forests and new trees are being planted. This benefits the forest ecosystem and also boosts the local economy through the sale of nuts, leaves and bark.<p>


At Rio, Prime Minister John Major identified five key areas in which the aid programme would promote sustainable development and environmental objectives. 
These were forest management, biodiversity, population, sustainable agriculture and the efficient use of energy. By 1994 the ODA had redesigned or revised strategies for each of these, which are shaping Britain's help to developing countries as they put Agenda 21 into effect.<p>


More than 150 countries met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and produced Agenda 21, a wide-ranging plan of action for sustainable development into the next century. 
At the heart of Agenda 21 is the idea of national sustainable development plans. All sections of the community should be involved in producing these plans which stress the need for cooperation between everyone from governments and non-governmental organisations to businesses, trade unions, local communities and scientists. Participation and cooperation are the keys to successful sustainable development.<p>

The Western Ghats project is just one example of this cooperative approach to conservation in 1994. Since the Earth Summit people everywhere have become more aware of the need to ensure that economic development and conservation go hand-in-hand. 1994 was an important year in the process of turning Rio into reality, because it saw the first working session of the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD) which was established to monitor how well all countries are meeting the aims of Agenda 21.<p>


<b>Forests</b><br>
Forests are the richest ecosystems on land. They are home to a huge variety of species, especially the rainforests. Forests also play a vital role in regulating world climate by absorbing carbon dioxide. They protect water sources, prevent soil erosion and are major sources of all-important raw materials and economic wealth. Rio introduced international guidelines for protecting them.<p>

Currently, the ODA is working on about 200 forestry projects in 45 countries at a cost of over £157 million. Many, like the Western Ghats, encourage sustainable forest management. Others support agroforestry, which combines sustainable agriculture and forestry.
In September 1993, Britain and India signed the Indo-British Forestry Initiative. A highly successful workshop was held in July, which produced guidelines for countries to follow when reporting 
to the CSD on forestry. <p>

<b>Biodiversity</b><br>  
The enormous variety of plants and animals is not just a feature of beautiful wildlife programmes. Biological riches also feed, clothe and heal us and are the basis of our economic development. Britain ratified the Rio Biodiversity Convention in 
June 1994, and produced its own Action Plan in January 1994 to show how the Convention will be implemented in the UK.
Between 1991 and 1994 the ODA spent over £34 million to help conserve biodiversity in developing countries. Projects range from habitat conservation to support for national conservation plans and systems.<p>

<b>Climate change</b><br> 
Greenhouse gas emissions from industry and agriculture are heating the Earth's atmosphere and triggering potentially serious shifts in world climate.  Britain ratified the Rio Climate Change Convention in 1993, and Britain's own strategy for action was published in 1994. The Convention aims to balance the need to control emissions with the desire to maintain development.<p>

Last year the ODA funded research on methane emissions from rice cultivation and the potential impact of climate change on coral reefs and tropical crops. And for some years, the ODA has helped people from developing countries participate in meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which researches and reports on the problem.  <p>

<b>Energy efficiency</b><br> 
Improving efficiency in producing, distributing 
and consuming energy is one of the best ways 
of controlling atmospheric pollution and global warming.  Using less energy also cuts costs - a plus for any national economy. Through its strategy for energy efficiency, the ODA's work last year focused on all these issues, and concentrated too on alternative energy sources such as wind power for pumping water. Between 1991 and 1994 the ODA spent over £140 million on projects that promote energy efficiency.<p>

<b>Ozone depletion</b><br>	 
The use of CFCs and other chemicals has torn holes in the atmosphere's ozone layer, leaving plants and animals vulnerable to harmful radiation. To help developing countries meet the extra costs of phasing out these chemicals, Britain had, by the end of 1994, committed £27 million to the Montreal Protocol Fund.<p>

<b>Desertification</b><br>	
Overgrazing, poor farming techniques and drought in dry regions, particularly in Africa, have degraded the land. This can severely reduce the land's capacity to support both people and animals. 
The importance of a renewed international effort to combat land degradation was recognised at Rio and in June 1994, the Desertification Convention was adopted. It emphasises the need for planning that involves local communities' full participation in a wide range of activities from soil conservation to tree planting. Britain has signed the convention and is working closely with developing countries on many of the issues that it covers.<p>

<b>Protecting the global environment </b><br>
The Earth Summit recognised that some environmental issues are global and therefore need global responses. But developing countries are clearly less able to respond than industrialised countries - they have less access to resources and need to concentrate those they have on national development. The international community recognised this and established the Global Environment Facility. The GEF helps developing countries meet the additional costs of protecting the global environment, including their responsibilities under the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions. To date, Britain has committed a total of £130 million to the GEF.<p>

<b>Research</b><br>
The ODA's Environmental Research Programme started in 1991 and is now well established. It is supporting research into such areas as the effects of climate change on tropical agriculture and on coral reefs, population and the environment and the relationship between tourism and conservation.<p>

Findings from research carried out under the ODA's Strategy for Research on Renewable Natural Resources help developing countries to increase the productivity of their renewable natural resources, in ways that are both sustainable and environmentally sound. British universities and other institutions work closely with the ODA on this research, which includes crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries and post-harvest issues.<p>

The <a href="http://www.nri.org/">Natural Resources Institute (NRI)</a> is the ODA's executive agency that handles most of its scientific work. This includes:
<ul><li>assessing and managing resources and farming systems
  developing approaches to pest control that minimise the use of  harmful chemicals and safeguard users, consumers and the environment.<p>

 <li> using food science to create a link between producers and consumers by investigating post-harvest problems and finding solutions.<p>

  <li>The ODA also commissions research on policy and institutional issues aimed at increasing the impact of its natural resources programmes.</ul><p>


<b>Sustainable agriculture </b><br>
Abdul tends his crop of chilli peppers. Aid has made it possible for him to earn a living and support his family. Agenda 21 highlights the importance of ensuring that food production for today'spopulation is not at the expense of the natural resources on which future generations will depend. <p>

Under its sustainable agriculture strategy, the ODA supports projects that work with farmers like Abdul to maintain or enhance the productivity of the land, sea, rivers and lakes, while improving long term food security. Over the last three years, the ODA has spent over £100 million on sustainable agriculture projects.<p>


One cold water tap providing the only source of sanitation for several households is a typical state of affairs for families living in Shanghai's huatongs Ð small single-storey houses. But the Shanghai Environmental Project aims to put an end to these conditions.  The ODA, together with the World Bank, is financing this large-scale engineering venture with Britain's contribution currently running to almost £2.5 million.<p>


Thousands of bicycle fish traders in Sri Lanka used to lose much of their daily stocks because the little ice they could afford would melt en route. The ODA through the NRI developed small lightweight insulated boxes to replace the traditional wooden carrying boxes. They are now being produced locally and have significantly improved the money these low-paid traders make. Contact with the NRI project has brought traders together to form a trade association for the first time.

Within a week she had leaked at least 72,000 tonnes of North Sea crude oil - a bigger spill than the Exxon Valdez.  Some of the UK's most protected coastlines - including 35 SSSIs - were devastated as the oil washed ashore.  It will be years before the full effects of the spill on the bird and sea life of the area are known.<p>The oil which caused such devastation to the Haven and surrounding areas last February belonged to the American multinational Texaco.  But the Sea Empress disaster hasn't cost Texaco a penny.<p> <font face="MetaBold, Verdana, arial, helvetica, sans" size=4 color=#C01135>THE GROUNDING OF THE SEA EMPRESS</font><p>On the morning of Thursday 15 February Texaco informed the Milford Haven Port Authority that there was a berth available at its docks and that the Sea Empress supertanker should be allowed to proceed to port.  A pilot was sent out alongside the tanker, and one hour and 20 minutes before low tide, the ship began steaming towards the Haven.  <p>Suddenly, and for reasons still unknown, the tanker grounded on St Anne's Head and began to leak oil.  For the whole of the next week tugs and rescue workers battled to free the stricken vessel and to contain the rapidly-spreading slick of toxic oil.  But violent gales and falling tides kept the ship stuck fast on the rock<p><blockquote><hr><font size=4>"When you look at the handling of the thing, you can almost smell the money the whole way through."</font><font size=2> - Journalist covering the Sea Empress oil spill, from the daily paper the Western Mail.</font><hr></blockquote>That's the official story.  The truth - should it ever come out - is probably very different.  For a start there is the question of why the Sea Empress attempted to make an entrance to the Haven at such a tricky time - 80 minutes before one of the lowest spring tides ever.  Was the pilot at fault?  Did the harbourmaster at Milford Haven Port Authority make a fatal error?  Or was Texaco, whose refinery many locals say was on the point of running out of oil, more to blame?<p><font face="MetaBold, Verdana, arial, helvetica, sans" size=4 color=#C01135>THE TEXACO CONNECTION</font><p>Ever since that fateful day in February 1996 there has been a persistent rumour  among the people of Milford Haven.  It goes like this: Texaco was running low in oil stocks in its refinery.  To have to close down the production process would have been disastrous - the whole system depends on a continuous throughput of oil.  Because of this, Texaco put pressure on the Port Authority to bring the ship in immediately, whatever the tide.  <p>Many locals admit that the Port Authority - which is dependent on Texaco for 50% of its entire business - is not in a position to argue with one the region's largest employers.  And the multinational oil company had just given the whole area - traditionally an employment blackspot - a big fright by threatening to move its entire operation to a new location in Malaysia.  So did Texaco force the tanker through Milford Haven's dangerous channel just to save money?<p>"Quite simply that is completely untrue," Texaco's Milford Haven spokesman David Lloyd told OneWorld. "The only involvement we have with tanker access is that our people tell the Port Authority when there is a berth available."  In any case, says Mr Lloyd, " we had sufficient crude for 7 - 8 days, which was quite normal for us at that time of the year."<p>But local Labour MP Nick Ainger is not so sure - and is calling for an independent inquiry into the whole affair.  "It was an extremely unusual situation to bring a ship in of that size an hour and 20 minutes before low water." <p> <font face="MetaBold, Verdana, arial, helvetica, sans" size=4 color=#C01135>ACCIDENT TURNS INTO DISASTER</font><p>Just about everyone agrees on two things.  One is that the Sea Empress oil spill was a minor accident that turned into a major environmental catastrophe.  The other is that the Port Authority deserves to take much of the blame.<p>"She grounded on Thursday evening," says retired pilot and marine expert Ieuan Evans.  "The disaster didn't start until Saturday evening.  On the Saturday the vessel could have been brought up to the terminal quite easily."<p>A Friends of the Earth press release, issued on 15 April 1996, makes the same point: "Once the tanker had struck the rocks, FoE believes that the salvage operation was hampered by an apparent confusion in the command structure as to who was in overall charge.  This could explain why permission to take the tanker to a safer location out to sea was refused even though the tides would have permitted this on four occasions subsequent to the initial grounding."<p>What is clear is that the Sea Empress was not stuck on the rocks at all.  At each high tide from Thursday 15th until Sunday 18th the salvors could either have brought the ship safely into port to contain the oil spillage, or taken her out to sea where both she and the coastline would have been spared further damage.  In fact the worst kind of indecision prevailed, and the tanker stayed where she was - taking further damage from the rocks at each low tide.<p><table border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=100%><tr><td bgcolor=#99ff99><font color=#003300><h3>Environmental effects of the Sea Empress spill</h3>The Sea Empress disaster has had devastating ecological impacts.  Over 175 miles of fragile coastline - including 35 Sites of Special Scientific Interest, 20 National Trust properties and a marine nature reserve - were affected by massive oil slicks.<p>The spill from the stricken tanker was the UK's third largest to date (after the Braer  and the Torrey Canyon), and it may have been the most destructive.  Of the 73,450 tonnes officially spilled, only 3000 tonnes are estimated to have been recovered during the 'clean--up' operation.<p>A comprehensive report by Friends of the Earth  found that "the massive kill of marine animals will cause long term ecological changes, including a change in species diversity, and species and population numbers."  Some sensitive eel-grass beds may not recover for two centuries - if they recover at all.<p>All this has taken place in an area which is already showing long-term environmental degradation.  Milford Haven is a busy oil port, and pollution-sensitive species in the area are in long-term decline.  Many SSSIs in the Haven have been repeatedly damaged by smaller unrecorded spillages.  <p>Included in the casualty list were fish  - whose eggs and larvae are extremely sensitive to oil pollution - and 25 different species of birds.  At least half the population of migrant Scoter Ducks was killed, as were thousands of Guillemots, Cormorants, Oyster Catchers, Gulls, Shags and Red Throated Divers. A conservative estimate is that up to 20,000 birds died either from drowning, hyperthermia or swallowing toxic oil whilst preening.<p>"There is no doubt that the Sea Empress wreck and subsequent oil spill constitute a major regional disaster," concludes the FoE report.  "Long-term environmental and socio-economic effects will still be detectable well into the 21st century."</font></td></tr></table><p><font face="MetaBold, Verdana, arial, helvetica, sans" size=4 color=#C01135>MILFORD HAVEN PORT AUTHORITY</font><p>In a famous exchange, supposed to have taken place between a pilot on board the Sea Empress and the harbourmaster at Milford Haven Port Authority, the pilot explains that the ship's engines are working and that she could be brought into port.  "I'd say bring her in, but I've got a roomful of people telling me not to," replied the harbourmaster.  Who were this 'roomful of people'?  It's a question no-one has yet answered.<p>By the Sunday evening, when the weather began to worsen, the Sea Empress had been at St Anne's Head for three days.  Yet she had still only spilled about 2,000 tonnes of oil.  On subsequent days, as the ship languished on the rocks and was buffeted by storm-force winds, oil flooded out in massive quantities.  By the following Thursday when she finally limped into Milford Haven port - still under her own power - she had lost 72,000 tonnes.<p>Says Ieuan Evans: "The question that has to be asked is why wasn't the ship brought up on the Saturday  to the terminal where she eventually ended up?  Because that's what caused the disaster."  There is no doubt that bringing the ship in was an option.  Evans, an ex-pilot, has done the calculations himself.  He worked out that at that time the Sea Empress would have had at least 3 metres of water - well within safety margins - between her keel and the sea floor.<p>So why was the decision not made?  "Because they didn't do a back-of-an-envelope calculation," claims Evans.  "They had made the wrong calculation and the whole salvage operation was based on assumptions that in my opinion will not be able to stand the test of an investigation."<p><blockquote><hr><font size=4>"What they talked about was that they were 99.9% sure that there wouldn't be a major spill.  But we got the 0.1%."</font><font size=2>  Milford Haven fisherman.</font><hr></blockquote><p>Milford Haven Port Authority may also carry some of the blame for the initial grounding of the Sea Empress.  The port's radar was not covering the whole area (it still isn't).  Only one pilot was assigned to bring the ship in - a job almost "physically impossible" to do single-handed, according to other pilots.  And in a sense the Authority even had advance warning: another oil tanker had hit the same rocks the previous October.<p>According to Ieuan Evans, management changes in the mid 1980s meant that commercial priorities had begun to overtake navigational ones.  The Port Authority began using its funds to buy up smaller companies and leisure facilities, while neglecting to notice changes in shipping patterns.  Ominously, the Authority failed to make a distinction between ship size and carrying capacity - at a time when tankers were getting bigger, but were still carrying the same tonnage of oil.<p>An unpleasant aspect of the saga is the attempt to scapegoat the pilot John Pearns for allowing the Sea Empress to run aground.  Stories mysteriously appeared in the press speculating that Pearns might have been 'intoxicated' at the time - a claim strenously denied by the pilot and all his colleagues.  In addition, Pearns was called before a Board of Enquiry, found to be 'negligent' and demoted.  Following an appeal he was reinstated - but his career has been badly damaged.<p><img align=left border=1 hspace=10 vspace=10 width=200 height=300 src="../images/feb97_empress.jpg"><pre></pre><font size=2>The Sea Empress in a Milford Haven dock, after her return to port.

Dubbed 'Goschen who doesn't have a notion about the ocean',  "even hardened oil industry professionals were laughing at him." <p> According to Deere-Jones, Lord Goschen spurned the offer of clean-up help from a Norwegian vessel.  He also stamped on attempts to have the affected area declared an EC disaster area - because it would have been bad for the Government's reputation. <p>Then there is the question of the tugs.  One of the main reasons that the Sea Empress sustained so much damage on the rocks was the lack of tug pulling-power to keep her in position.  Yet this had been one of the main recommendations of Lord Donaldson's report into the 1994 Braer oil disaster in the Shetlands, that tugs should be stationed strategically around the British coastline to offer assistance to stranded ships.  <p>But this recommendation was not implemented.  When the Sea Empress ran aground the tug for the Western Approaches was down near Portugal - quite legitimately 'on business'.  In the event a Chinese tug - one of the most powerful in the world - was nearby Milford Haven at the time.  But according to observers none of the crew members spoke English, and the Port Authority had to engage the services of a local Chinese restauranteur as a translator.  Now, to add insult to injury, the Government is questioning the need for tugs at all in the area.  <p><blockquote><hr><font size=4>"The people of Milford have been deafened by the sound of stable doors being slammed after the Sea Empress."</font><font size=2> - Nick Ainger MP</font><hr></blockquote><p>The Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the Department of Transport is currently conducting an enquiry into the Sea Empress disaster.  But, as Ainger points out, in effect DoT employees are being asked to investigate their colleagues.  "It's wrong to ask a civil servant working in the same department to actually investigate the political actions of a minister." Because of this, the report is likely to be little more than a "whitewash".<p><font face="MetaBold, Verdana, arial, helvetica, sans" size=4 color=#C01135>A CRIMINAL ACT?</font><p>You can forgive incompetence, and maybe even negligence.  But what if much of the oil spillage was deliberate - a criminal act against a fragile ecosystem?  This may sound unlikely - but there are many people who consider it a distinct possibility.  <p>For a start, the biggest leakage of  20,000 to 30,000 tonnes was lost on the Wednesday night - hours before the Sea Empress came into port.  Says Ieaun Evans: "I am told that on the Wednesday oil was deliberately gravitated to sea."<p>Could the salvors, desperate to prevent the loss of the ship, have deliberately pumped oil out of the Sea Empress and into the sea at St Anne's Head?  Bill Pritchard, environmentalist and journalist, thinks that they did.  "Everyone was cleared off the headland.  No planes were allowed to fly overhead.  There was this ridiculous story put about that suddenly there was an explosion risk.  What were they doing at that time?  What didn't they want people to see?"<p><table align=right border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=40%><tr><td bgcolor=#99ff99><font color=#003300><h3>The 'clean-up' operation</h3>From the day after the Sea Empress ran aground, government aircraft swooped repeatedly over the oil slick, spraying chemicals to break it up.  In total some 445 tonnes of dispersants were used - the largest amount in UK waters since 1970.  But as marine biologist Tim Deere-Jones says: "Dispersants are supposed to be not more toxic than the oil - but they are still toxic."  In addition, by breaking up the slick on the sea surface, oil droplets spread throughout the water column - having a major impact on acquatic life such as shellfish.  <p>Although their exact composition is protected by 'commerical confidentiality', most dispersants are oil-based, - and, ironically, are manufactured by the same oil companies whose oil they may be trying to disperse.  Dispersants used on the Sea Empress oil spill were bought from Exxon and BP, among others.<p>Spraying dispersants on the shoreline may also be little more than a cosmetic exercise.  Cleaning oiled rocks and scraping sand off beaches may reduce visible damage and benefit the tourist trade - but it may also do more harm than good.  Deere-Jones points out that the Exxon Valdez spill showed that such activities "increase immediate ecological damage and delay or prolong the recovery process."<p></font></td></tr></table><p>Pritchard believes that the salvors, who have said they pumped compressed air into the Sea Empress to give her extra buoyancy, may have used it to drive oil out of her tanks.  They would have had a commercial interest in doing this - there is more insurance money to be earned saving a ship than in merely saving its cargo and risking the loss of the ship itself.<p>In addition, many locals believe that far more oil than the admitted total of 72,000 tonnes was spilt in the disaster.  "I saw the ship on its moorings and as far as I was concerned the thing was empty," a local fisherman told OneWorld. "Most of the people round here think the thing was empty when it came in.  But then that would make it the biggest oil disaster ever - which means the Government would have had to pump money in, and they didn't want to put a penny in."<p><font face="MetaBold, Verdana, arial, helvetica, sans" size=4 color=#C01135>ANOTHER SEA EMPRESS?</font><p>So could the Sea Empress happen again?  The answer is a resounding 'yes'.  Although supertankers now have two pilots to guide them in, Milford Haven Port Authority still does not provide total radar coverage - although "you need radar to operate a modern port", according to MP Nick Ainger.  "An awful lot of complacency has set in and safety margins have been cut and cut on a whole range of issues."<p>There is still insufficient tug pulling power available.  And, despite being faced with increasing ship sizes, the Authority has done nothing to improve on-shore navigational aids - a major complaint of pilots.  <p>Local environmentalist Joy Roland is campaigning for the whole area to be designated a 'Special Area of Conservation' under the EC Habitats Directive.  "I'm still worried about the level of safety in the Haven," she told OneWorld.  But the application is being opposed by Milford Haven Port Authority on the grounds that it would impede industrial development.<p><b><font face="MetaBold, Verdana, arial, helvetica, sans" size=4 color=#C01135>WHO PAYS THE PRICE?</font></b><p>Knowing the inherent dangers of its business, the oil industry has set up a system which enables individual companies to remain apparently blameless for spills of their own toxic cargo.<p>Take the Sea Empress.  She was built in Spain, owned and skippered by a Norwegian, registered in Cyprus, managed from Glasgow, chartered by the French, crewed by Russians and was flying a Liberian 'flag of convenience'.  It's the ultimate multinational business.<p>But who pays the price?  Not Texaco.  Although the company gave some help to the 'clean-up' as a goodwill gesture, it didn't have to.  Liability for environmental damage was covered up to a limit of $15 million by the Scandinavian insurers Skuld.  Additonal costs - including compensation claims - was covered by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, to which most oil companies contribute.<p><b>The compensation claim period is 3 years.  After that, the people of Pembrokeshire are on their own.  "What I'm frightened of," a local fisherman told OneWorld, "is that all the fry died off this year because of the pollution.  Then in four years time there'll be no fish or lobsters or crabs to catch.  And there won't be compensation available then."</b><p>Some of the long-term effects will never be commercially quantifiable.  One press agency photographer remembers the poignant moment when the full realisation of what had happened hit him.  He was standing on the shoreline with a local diving instructor - a big man who knew the waters of the Haven well.  Seeing the diver sobbing uncontrollably, the photographer asked what was wrong.  "I grew up here," he said.  "I loved these waters as a boy.  And now they've destroyed them for my children."<p><a href="/cgi-bin/imagemap/news/images/newsbar.map" target="_top"><IMG SRC="../images/newsbar.gif" WIDTH="466" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom ISMAP BORDER="0"></a></body></html>

More will die unless immediate measuresare taken to relieve the situation.  Amnesty Internationaldelegates based in Rwanda visited the prison on 7 June andconfirmed the appalling conditions there.<p>Amnesty International had tried unsuccessfully to visit theprison twice, but had not been given the necessaryauthorization.  This time they were allowed inside the prisonwhere they spent almost one hour.  The delegates confirmedthat prisoners are suffering extreme cruel, inhuman anddegrading treatment as a result of severe overcrowding.<p>Gitarama prison is built for 600 inmates, but it now houses6847, including 102 children who appear to be under the age of14, and 218 women. In addition, there are 20 babies with theirmothers.  There is a total absence of hygiene and basicsanitary facilities, leading to serious health problems.  Theauthorities have announced a temporary halt to further arrestsas there is literally no more space for further prisoners.Prisoners cannot lie down due to overcrowding. The inmatesecurity guards held sticks and made room for the AmnestyInternational delegates to be able to walk through theprisoners.<p>An extension to the prison is currently being built, but it islikely that it will take several weeks to complete.  Theextension is around twice the size of the main prison, andwill therefore only partly relieve the overcrowding.<p>The vast majority of the prisoners have been arrested on vaguecharges of having taken part in the genocide. Only around2,500 of the total number of prisoners have had arrestwarrants issued.  The government has set up "commissions detriage" (screening committees) to examine the dossiers of theprisoners and release those against whom there is insufficientevidence.  However, so far this process has led to the releaseof only two prisoners from Gitarama prison.<p><h3>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h3>Since July 1994, when the present government of Rwanda tookpower, prison conditions in many official prisons andunofficial detention centres have been the cause of greatconcern as the authorities began arresting massive numbers ofpeople suspected of taking part in the genocide.  In June1995, there are thought to be over 40,000 people held withoutcharge or trial, often on the basis of unsubstantiateddenunciation. The fact that neither the national justicesystem in Rwanda nor the International Tribunal set up to trythose responsible for crimes against humanity are functioningyet means that innocent prisoners are likely to languish inseriously overcrowded prisons for some time unless urgentmeasures are taken.  Soon after their arrest, prisoners areoften ill-treated and tortured in detention centres beforebeing transferred to official prisons.<p>The conditions in Gitarama prison are notorious for being theworst in Rwanda.  However, earlier in 1995, AmnestyInternational delegates also witnessed serious overcrowding inseveral other prisons, including Butare, Rilima and Kigali.On 6 April 1995, Amnesty International published a reportentitled "Rwanda: Crying out for justice" which documents thecurrent human rights situation and highlights the plight ofthe tens of thousands of prisoners suffering inhuman prisonconditions and being held without charge or trial.<p><hr><p><i>Supporters of Amnesty International around the world are   writing urgent appeals in response to the concerns        described above.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

	<p>Technology and censorship are often seen as opposing forces in the information age. This tension is exemplified by the case of Singapore, which wants to harness new technologies for development while having censorship controls in place.   This paper looks at how Singapore is going about censorship of the Internet. It is part of a larger study into how Singapore proposes to censor without losing the advantages of new technologies.

	<p>The paper begins by noting that censorship in Singapore is justified on historical and socio-political grounds. Both the government and the people want it, favouring caution and prevention over liberalism.

	<p>In line with these desires, the Singapore government has drawn up guidelines for censorship. In practice, however, some of these principles conflict, especially when censorship of the Internet is attempted.

	<p>The paper then looks at problems in censorship of the Internet and examines some censorship measures that have been attempted.

	<p>The paper concludes with the observation that current thinking suggests it is almost impossible to both control information and reap the benefits of the information age. Singapore is trying nevertheless.


<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

	<p>In 1991, Singapore's National Computer Board, a quasi-government body that looks into the use of computers, began a study on how information technology could be harnessed to create new competitive advantages and improve the quality of life in Singapore.

	<p>Also in that year, the Ministry of Information and the Arts began its once-a-decade review of censorship laws and standards across all media.

	<p>When both reports were completed, it was clear that neither technology nor censorship could stand without one considering the other. Some censorship laws could impact negatively the diffusion of computers in society. On the other hand, new forms of media were making it difficult to maintain the extant level of censorship. The dilemma was, and is, that Singapore wants to harness new technologies for development, but its citizenry also wants censorship controls in place. In the words of Bill Gates, chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corporation after a recent meeting with top Singapore officials, "They are going to try to have their cake and eat it too."[1]

	<p>The problem of censorship and new technology is best highlighted by the Internet. At present, Internet is available to tertiary institutions through a service called TechNet and to home and business subscribers through Singapore Telecom's Singnet, currently the only commercial service provider. The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (TAS) has plans to allow the entry of a second commercial Internet service provider in the near future. Already, IBM, Apple and Microsoft have expressed interest in being service providers. A recent estimate by Minister for Information and the Arts George Yeo suggests that some 26,000 Singaporeans are now on the Internet, with the number growing by more than a thousand a month. [2]

	<p>This paper looks at censorship of the fast-growing Internet from a Singapore perspective of minimising the negative effects of the new medium while maximising the benefits to be derived from it. The paper shows some limitations, and possibilities, when censorship is attempted on the Internet.


<h4>2. Basis of Censorship in Singapore</h4>

	<p>From a Western, especially American, perspective, censorship is difficult if not impossible to defend. But the position of the Singapore government and indeed even the citizenry is that there are good reasons for censorship. First, as there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that media can have negative effects on their consumers, it is therefore wiser to err on the side of caution through censorship. Second, there have been incidents in the past where media reports have caused racial riots and the shedding of blood. These are the 1950 Maria Hertogh riots, the 1964 riots during Prophet Muhammad's birthday, and the 1969 riot spillover from Malaysia. These riots have been blamed partly on uninhibited reporting and are often cited as examples of how the press can incite racial and ethnic violence.[3]

	<p>In the Maria Hertogh case, the Malay press played up the angle (in its words and pictures) that the Dutch girl brought up as a Muslim by a Malay family was now forced to take up the Christian religion. The story was read by the Muslim community as a case of religious injustice and a riot broke out--leaving 18 dead and 173 wounded.[4] Most recently, the execution of a Filipino domestic help in Singapore has sparked off anti-Singapore sentiments in the Philippines. Again, uninhibited and erroneous reporting have been blamed for the demonstrations and protests against Singapore.[5]

	<p>Events like these are used to justify the need for tight censorship in a multiracial/multireligious society, where the unimpeded flow of ideas instead of leading to enlightenment can sometimes have negative effects.[6]

	<p>Censorship also survives because of the widespread support of Singaporeans, as a recent survey by the first author found. On a censorship scale of 1 to 7, the three areas where Singaporeans wanted most censorship were materials for the young, news leading to race conflict and racially offensive public expression in that order.[7]

	<p>Thus, censorship in Singapore is justified on historical as well as socio-political grounds, favouring caution and prevention over liberalism. This position has been systematically articulated by the government and accepted by the people as one of the boundaries within which Singapore society must function.


<h4>3. Principles of Censorship in Singapore</h4>

	<p>Administration of censorship in Singapore has been performed in a typically methodical manner with guidelines developed through experience.[8]

	<p>First, materials going into the home are more heavily censored than those going into the corporate world. The Singapore authorities have drawn a distinction between information for business uses, which should be as free flowing as possible, and information for non-business uses. Information for the home is seen to be of a less critical nature so censorship of such information is regarded to have not as deleterious an effect. 

	<p>Second, materials for the young are more heavily censored than those for adults. This is an admittedly paternalistic principle of protecting the weaker members of society from the possible harm of the materials in question.

	<p>Third, materials for public consumption are more heavily censored than those for private consumption. This is a corollary of the second principle as it is assumed that the public includes those who are "weaker." Also, regardless of the level of censorship those who are determined can always get their hands on them. Hence private consumption can only be policed to a limited extent. Further, it is more efficient to police public instead of private consumption. It should be noted that private consumption of censorship materials is still policed in that those found in private possession of censored materials can be convicted in court.

	<p>Finally, materials deemed to have artistic and educational merit are less heavily censored. This is a recently articulated principle and has been applied to movies, which now have an R(A) or Restricted (Artistic) rating.

	<p>In sum, censorship in Singapore has an element of differentiation: home vs. business, children vs. adults, public vs. private consumption. Further, materials that can be shown to have some tangible and wider benefit - such as for business, art and education - are censored with a much lighter hand.  On the other hand, materials deemed to have less tangible benefit - such as "pure entertainment" - are 
censored more heavily.

	<p>To be sure, some of these principles come into conflict in the administration of censorship. The  concession to artistic materials is an admission of one such conflict. On the Internet, however, the conflict is magnified.


<h4>4. Problems in Censorship of the Internet</h4>

	<p>As a new technology, the Internet defies censorship because of characteristics such as information explosion, de-massification, convergence, computer culture and globalisation. 

	<p>First, the Internet has the ability to explode information onto every user. More information can be gathered and distributed at a faster pace, meaning that the flow of information in circulation increases at an exponential rate. In Singapore, however, the number of censors at work has not kept pace with the explosive growth in the amount of censorable materials. 

	<p>Censorship in Singapore is undertaken by the Censorship Section of the Ministry of Information and the Arts. Figures from the Censorship Section show that the number of censors has increased by 80 percent in the 10 years from 9 in 1983 to 16 in 1993. The amount of materials that the Censorship Section has to vet, however, has increased 400 per cent. over the same period - from 102,352 in 1983 to 408,863 in 1993. On a per-person basis, the workload has increased five-fold from about 5,500 in 1978 to more than 25,000 in 1993.[9]

	<p>Employing more censors is, at best, a short-term solution and in a tight labor market, an expensive one too. Censorship is also made difficult as the Section has only begun to obtain the equipment necessary to vet electronic publications. Vetting, already selective even in the 1980s, has to be even more so in the 1990s as the capacity to censor is unlikely to match the amount of information being generated.

	<p>Second, the Internet borders between being a mass and a specialised medium. The information available on the Internet is not intended for the mass audience. Usenet groups and web sites, for example, are intended to cater to a specialised audience.[10] Information on these groups and sites tend to be less mass and more customised, and the distribution points are multiple. This decentralisation suggests that censorship could technically follow the Censorship Review Committee's principle of differentiation by target audience, i.e. homes vs. businesses, the young vs. adults. 

	<p>However, the nature of the Internet is that it has all the potential to be a mass medium. This poses a problem for Singapore censors because the greater reach of material calls for a heavier degree of censorship. The Internet therefore poses a  problem for the censorship guidelines as it conflates the distinctions between public and private consumption.

	<p>Third, the Internet is an example of a convergent medium: it has a mail function, a news-reading function and a computing-software function. Convergence poses problems for censorship because it becomes difficult to classify the new medium and to decide who regulates them and how. Singapore's current censorship regime assumes that the media are distinct and separate from one another.

	<p>There are three regulatory regimes for the Internet. First, it could be classified as a telecommunications service because one major use is electronic mail. Second, it could be considered a computer service because one needs a computer to access the Internet. Third, the availability of information through Usenet group and web-sites, where they can reach a wide audience electronically, could qualify the Internet as a broadcasting service.

	<p>Singapore has chosen the third option: to treat the Internet as a broadcast service. It is to be regulated under the recently-passed Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) Act, which defines broadcasting broadly--in terms of programme transmission to all or part of the public, regardless of the means used. The Act could require computer networks to be licensed by gazetting them as "licensable broadcasting services", but they have been excluded for now.[11] Regulation in Singapore is such that there is no censorship of mail, a little censorship of computing for pornographic software and heavier censorship of news. The Internet therefore falls into cracks in regulation.

	<p>Fourth, censorship does not sit well with computer culture, where maximum (and often anarchistic) freedom is celebrated. Cyberspace culture is not value-free in that it privileges free speech and the free flow of ideas as a route to social and intellectual progress. For example, the US Senate Commerce Committee's proposal to ban obscene material in cyberspace faces strong opposition from Internet users and scepticism from critics that the collection of networks can at all be controlled.[12]

	<p>Apart from a council that sets technical standards, there is no central controlling body for the Internet. As a result, any of its services can carry undesirable content, be it text, sound or image. System administrators at individual sites may censor by restricting the materials that users may access, but this does not prevent users from bypassing local service providers and accessing such restricted materials directly from overseas service providers.Besides, the Internet is thus inherently resistant to censorship, both in its operating philosophy and technical set-up. Any kind of censorship is read by the Internet as "damage" and the system will attempt to correct it. Dynamic re-routing ensures that if one communication link is broken, the traffic can be re-directed through other existing links. The Internet, after all, was designed for military use and the design criteria were fault tolerance and reliability even after a nuclear attack.[13]

	<p>Fifth, the Internet highlights a major problem in global interconnectivity: what legal standard applies? Legally, everything is allowed on the Internet as long as it does not violate the laws in the country where the originator resides. But even if the law of the land is broken, it is well-nigh impossible to enforce criminal laws outside of one's country. For example, it would be difficult to pinpoint just who is responsible for the distribution of pornography when the pornography has flown in through an interconnected network. Further, controlling the flow of information into the receiving country also means controlling the flow of information from the originating country. Even if the laws were in place in the receiving country, there would still have to be corresponding enforcement and perhaps extradition arrangements in the originating country as well.

	<p>The trend of global interconnectivity means that any attempts at censorship has to consider the international dimensions. The Internet not only throws up the question of what standard of censorship to be adopted, but also suggests that local standards have to be worked out in mutual juxtaposition with global standards.  

	<p>A final point is that legislation and case-law tend to proceed piecemeal and almost always lag behind changes in technology. The current regulatory framework was developed in the context of the traditional print media, and the relatively newer media of radio and television broadcasting, telecommunications, films and videotapes. If censorship is to be enforced on a concordant basis, the trend of convergence requires that the present laws be updated. 

	<p>For example, the Singapore Penal Code provision for distribution of pornography is lacking in these aspects:

<ul>1. It does not explicitly cover materials that are not visibly obscene. Two rather old cases interpreting the obscenity provisions have held that the obscene object must be obviously obscene. Thus a pornographic videotape would not be captured because without mechanical aid, it looks just like any other videotape.[14]

<p>2. It does not cover the situation where obscene materials are distributed from one computer to another as is frequently done through the Internet.

<p>3. The requirement of knowledge of content, that is whether the content is obscene or not, is not spelt out in the Act. Case law is conflicting. In other words, it is not clear if someone charged with the offence of possession of an obscene object can be acquitted if he or she was genuinely unaware that the contents were obscene. This is a critical issue in the context of information explosion. This means that network administrators who may not know that the materials on their site are pornographic or that such materials are being transmitted through their site may be caught under the current regime. 
</ul>
	<p>The above discussion shows that process of censorship in the age of new technologies is problematic as new laws tend to be inadequate modifications of old laws applied to older technology.


<h4>5. Censorship Measures</h4>

	<p>The above difficulties in censoring the Internet notwithstanding, Singapore is exploring ways to put controls in place. One way to control technology is to use technology itself as a control mechanism. True to its style, the Singapore government has looked into using technology in censorship. The National University of Singapore, for example, has different servers for staff and students. The idea is that staff will get materials with less censorship than students.

	<p>The lesson from the West, however, appears to be that censorship using technology does not work well. For example, university professor Richard DePew developed a programme he called ARMM (Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation) to delete anonymous messages to Usenet groups. The programme failed at first. Then when it succeeded, it actually affected the workings of other connected computers.[15]

	<p>Others have tried less sophisticated methods of censorship, such as using algorithms to search for censored words. These methods, however, are often bypassed using encryption or counter-technology.[16]

	<p>Recently, through some misunderstanding of an high-level official request, public Internet accounts of a business service in Singapore were scanned for .GIF files. The method used was simply a search engine that sought out files with the .GIF extension. Of 80,000 files scanned, five were found pornographic by Singapore standards and those users were issued warnings.[17] Speaking to the authors later, a few irate users said they would consider renaming all their files with a .GIF extension, just to make life a little more difficult for the search. Of more concern to the service provider, many users expressed grave reservations with the security and privacy on the system.[18]

	<p>A somewhat more refined approach is to patrol the Internet. Technically, anyone at any connected site in the network can monitor it. The Internet lends itself to traffic analysis, where the content may not be known, but the source and destination can suggest certain interests. For example, traffic to a particular overseas site known to contain pornographic material may be more closely monitored. The sheer amount of information and "noise", however, makes this method highly inefficient and improbable.

	<p>It is possible, at a cost of US$70,000 a year, to create a separate server to censor, within limits, Usenet groups. Then, some users will have access to materials that others do not. This will prevent all but the most determined from accessing those censored groups. But it is costly to manage the system, especially with the labour shortage in Singapore. Further, it is possible to access other servers that offer access to Usenet. Therefore, such controls are not technically or economically feasible.

	<p>Currently, Usenet groups in Singapore are censored using guidelines issued by the Ministry of Information and the Arts, the government body in charge of media censorship. For example, Usenet groups accessed through the local telecommunications provider, Singapore Telecom, are more heavily censored than those accessed through the local universities. The Unix shell used by Singapore Telecom has been deliberately crippled to remove some functions. Subscribers have to use the menu to access the Internet services.[19]

	<p>Some censorship is also implicit in the fact that Usenet groups enter Singapore through Technet before reaching the local universities, where system administrators decide if certain groups should be deleted. The system administrators can also set conditions for usage, revoke certain services from users' accounts (e.g. electronic mail, Usenet access, file transfer capabilities, remote communications), or deny login access totally. These rules tend to be haphazard and crisis-oriented. Currently, there are no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use of any Internet services, and local administrators have to make arbitrary decisions on access.  

	<p>Apart from an act relating to the criminal misuse of computers, Singapore has little regulation on computer networks and looks set to continue that way at least for the near future. Control over pornography is through the existent laws. There is talk of an amendment to the Films Act to cover both moving and still images - which would include pornographic pictures on the computer. But the amendment is still being studied for its wider implications.[20]


<h4>6. Conclusion</h4>

	<p>The Singapore government is well aware that it cannot do much to censor the Internet. In fact, as the discussion above as shown, censorship can impact the workings of the Internet and faith of users in the system. But, as the Minister for Information and the Arts has said, the Singapore government will not give up without a fight.[21]

	<p>The main means of censorship is to control access. The rationale is that this will allow only the determined to get at the materials, thus excluding the novice and the casual user.

	<p>Of late, the issue has shifted from censorship of pornographic material to censorship of "misinformation," as political debates are increasingly tossed around in cyberspace. For example, issues discussed on the newsgroup soc.culture.singapore have ranged from American Michael Fay's caning and the hanging of Dutch drug trafficker Johannes Van Damme to the recent case of Flor Contemplacion, the Filipino maid convicted of double murder.[22][23]

	<p>To that end, an administrative committee has been formed to provide information (and rebut inaccurate information) about Singapore on the Internet through "Singapore Infomap."[24] The group includes members from the Economic Development Board, the National Computer Board, the Ministry of Information and the Arts, and Internet access providers Technet and Singnet. The youth wing of the ruling party, Young PAP, has also set up a section to state the government's views.  It appears that Singapore's response to the problem of control over the Internet has been to stake out a place for itself in the cyberspace neighbourhood, as the Minister has put it. 

	<p>Singapore's case is instructive in that it is trying to do both--control information and yet reap the benefits of the information age. Current thinking suggests that it is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve both aims. Singapore is trying nevertheless.<br>

Videos for educational and campaign purposes are distributed in a variety of languages through one of the One World's associate partners, the Television Trust for the Environment (TVE) in London. International collaboration between NGOs is promoted by another close associate of the Group, the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe, based in Lisbon.<p>Plans for 1995 are based on the United Nations 50th anniversary, and centre around the idea of "global citizenship" - the very core of the idea of One World.<p>©Copyright One World Group 1994<p><hr>For further information, please contact:<br><b>Ritchie Cogan, Director<br>One World Group<br>302, BBC Yalding House<br>152, Great Portland St,<br> London W1N 6AJ<br>Tel: + 44 - (0) 171 765 5035<br>Fax: + 44 - (0) 171 765 5459</b><hr><a href="../top.html"><imgsrc="../owo_pix/home.gif">OneWorld Menu</a><hr></body></html>

<h2>THE UK AND THE WIDER DEVELOPMENT AGENDA<br>BARONESS CHALKER'S SPEECH AT ROBERT FLEMING & CO, 15

JULY 1996</h2>



<p><a href="http:../../oda/index.html" target="_top">Visit the ODA WWW Home Page</a>

</center>

<hr>

<p>

Introduction I am most grateful for the opportunity to speak to

you today.  I want to examine how Government can work in

partnership with the private sector on the wider development

agenda.





<p>

We already work extensively with the private sector.  I want to

deepen this relationship - both at home and abroad.  Partnership

with the private sector is essential to promoting sustainable

development.  Sustainable development is not only important in

its own right, but it is also the key to building the markets of

the future, and vital to Britain's own long-term interests.





<p>

In speaking today, I should therefore like:



<blockquote>- to explain how the Government sees the wider

development agenda, the complementary roles of the

public and private sectors, and British interests;    

<p>

- to describe what the UK is doing to promote this agenda, and  

the changes to ODA's own role;     

<p>

-    to share with you some of the successes;    

<p>

-    and to invite you to tell us more about the ways in which government

may be able to help

you to play a part.</blockquote>



<p>

The wider development agenda As you know, two weeks ago the

heads of G7 governments met in Lyon for their annual summit. 

Global interdependence and development were two of the main

themes of the meeting - and rightly so.  Let me touch on each in

turn.

<p>

My overseas visits constantly remind me of how interdependent a world we live in.  The global exchange is unending:  of goods

and services, of information, of people and ideas, of disease. 

Conflicts, terrorism and crime spill over borders.  Competition

for and misuse of natural resources threaten our common

environment.

<p>

It is ever clearer in today's complex and interdependent world

that 'development' is about more than aid flows from the Western

public sector.  The development agenda is a much wider one.  It

has to be.

<p>

It is an agenda in which the private sector has a key role to

play.  This is vividly demonstrated by the net resource flows to

developing countries.  Total flows in 1995 were $231 billion. 

Private capital accounted for threequarters of this total.  Ten

years ago the official sector accounted for more than half

aggregate resources flows.  Last year it amounted to a quarter. 

Alongside these huge private flows has gone the much-needed

injection of private sector experience, and disciplines. 

Against this background I am particularly pleased that the

Summit paid tribute to the record levels of private investment

flows to the developing world, and acknowledged the key role of

the private sector in-country, as the main engine of growth.

<p>

Governments have a crucial role to play too.  It is only

governments who collectively - can put the right international

policy framework in place.  It is only governments in developing

countries who can get the local policy the  environment right.

<p>

Turning first to the international framework, trade policy

clearly has a key part to play.  It is vital that developing

countries should have the opportunity of greater market access

for their goods and services.  Alongside this, action needs to

be taken internationally to relieve the debt burden of heavily

indebted countries - helping these countries back into private

capital markets.  

<p>

Governments have a vital part to play as aid donors too. 

Despite the vast flows of private capital, the fact remains that

these are heavily skewed towards a small number of the more

successful countries.  There is a continuing role for donors -

in providing concessional flows and directing these to those

countries who need them most, and can use them effectively.  

<p>

There is a fundamental role too for the governments of

developing countries.  It is they who must create a positive and

welcoming climate for both the domestic and the foreign private

sector.  This is not just a question of getting the right

economic policies.  It is also about pursuing the wider good government agenda:  establishing open and accountable

institutions, the rule of law and genuine participation in the

process of government.  The prime responsibility in all these

areas rests with developing countries themselves.  Without real

commitment on their part, the domestic private sector on which

growth depends will not develop.  Nor will the country be able

to compete in the market place for private sector flows from

outside.

<p>

Complementary roles of public and private sectors The message in

all this is clear.  The private sector and Government can and

must support each other.  Their roles are complementary.  The

effort the public sector is putting into development, both by

trying to create the right policy framework, and by its own

resource flows - in the form of aid cannot succeed without an

active private sector role.  

<p>

But equally, private sector activity can be given a greater

stimulus by what governments can do - to create the environment

in which the private sector can thrive, and development can take

off.  Carefully targeted and effectively managed aid has a

crucial role to play in this process - by  supporting and

encouraging change.  



<p>

We are fortunate in that there is now a widespread consensus on

these two parts:  the shape of the wider development agenda, and

the complementary roles of the private and public sectors.  This

consensus provides a sound basis for success.





<p>

Britain has an important stake in this success.  It is right in

itself that we should be responding to the key challenge of

reducing poverty.  But it is also in Britain's interests, and

the interests of Britain's businesses that we should be

promoting development.  We cannot afford to take a parochial

view.  Exports account for a quarter of our GDP.  The shape of

the world is changing around us.  By the turn of the century

four-fifths of the world's population will live in developing

countries.  If we can promote growth in these countries we will

be helping to create the markets of the future on which our own

growth and prosperity depends.





<p>

May I therefore to the part the UK is playing internationally to

promote this wider agenda.  It is a part we - both government

and private sector can be proud of.

<p>

The UK has a larger stock of investment overseas (some @@700

billion) than any other country bar the United States - which

has an economy six times our size.  Indeed as a proportion of

our natural wealth we have more inward and outward investment

(nearly twice as much) than any other country.





<p>

The private sector in the UK is of course a provider not just of

essential capital flows - but of intellectual capital too.  Here

in the City you are an unrivalled source of know-how and

expertise on privatisation and financial restructuring.  These

are areas in which Britain is a world leader, and they are areas

of huge importance across the world - not only the rest of

Europe but also Africa and South Asia.





<p>

For our part, the Government has taken a leading role

internationally in promoting the liberalization of the global

trading system.  We have long had a forward position in the

European Union on this.  We will continue to argue for the

liberalizing agenda, both in Europe and on the wider

international stage.  This will be particularly relevant when we

come to consider the future of the trade aspects of the Lom&#233;

Convention.  We shall continue to play a leading role on

initiatives to help resolve the debt burden of the poorest

countries.





<p>

We have played a key role in promoting prudent macro-economic

policies and essential economic reforms.  Examples from Africa

alone range from:  civil service reform in Ghana, to venture

capital in Tanzania; and from reducing the regulation of private

business in Zimbabwe, to simplifying taxation and improving its

administration in Zambia.





<p>

And we maintain a high quality aid programme, complementing the

private sector by reaching into areas where private investment

does not yet reach, helping with basic social investment such as

health and education, helping with infrastructure provision, and

underpinning policy reform.



<p>

Successes I said earlier in my speech that the public sector

could help create the environment in which the private sector

could thrive, and development could take off.  Let me take this

chance to offer you some proof of this particular pudding.  Out

of Africa, perhaps for a change, some good news.  The vast

majority of African countries are now committed to prudent

macro-economic policies and private sector led growth.  Private

investment is welcomed and the more liberal policy environment

is increasingly one in which it can be profitable. 

Privatisation, after a slow start, has gathered pace recently. 

Successful examples like Ashanti Goldfields in Ghana, and Kenya

Airways, are part of a Continent wide trend.  The change in

attitude and policy is far reaching, and ODA has been at the

centre of supporting the changes.  And the results are starting

to pay off.  In 1995 African GDP as a whole grew by 5%, and

prospects are for a further good year in 1996.  Better weather

and higher export prices are part of the story.  But more

fundamental changes are also giving new momentum.  There have

been false dawns and cruel disappointments in Africa.  But there

are now real grounds for optimism about the future.





<p>

Against this background, I am pleased that the City is showing

renewed interest in Africa, with the existence of new investment

funds.  The most successful visit by President Mandela

highlighted the investment opportunities in the new South

Africa.  I hope you will respond to his encouragement of inward

investment.  I know that you will stay in touch with

developments there - and I urge you to stay in touch with other

positive investment locations in Africa too.





<p>

There are hundreds of similar success stories which show that aid can

work, and above all that British development assistance does work.  





<p>

At the same time, the wider development agenda needs to be

reflected in a widening of ODA's own agenda too.  It has been. 

The Overseas Development Administration, as the development wing

of the FCO, has too often been seen as essentially an agency

only for designing and managing aid projects.  







<p>Designing and managing aid projects is an essential part of what

the ODA does - and it is something the ODA is recognized

internationally as doing particularly well.

<p>

But it is only part.  Last year we undertook a far-reaching

review of ODA's role and activities.  We have, as a result of

this, drawn up a new Mission Statement in which we recognize the

wider development agenda.  Part of our mission is now explicitly

'to promote international policies for sustainable development',

and alongside this 'to enhance the effectiveness of multilateral

institutions'.





<p>

As ODA, we will seek to ensure that the role of developing

countries is taken into account more fully in the formulation of

the government's and international policies on trade and

investment.  We are now involving ourselves more closely in

trade and investment issues, such as the role of investment

guarantees, and the forthcoming first Ministerial Conference of

the WTO this December.  And we shall help ensure that the UK

continues to take a lead on debt initiatives.





<p>

We have traditionally played a leading role in international

institutions, by drawing on our own experience to push forward

policy development.  We have played a leading part in the

successful replenishment of IDA and the African Development

Fund, and in helping to refine the policies these institutions

should follow.  We have made it clear that the aid institutions

of the EC must improve the effectiveness with which they

operate.    We want to see better co-ordination in Brussels and

the field, and above all improvements in management.  I have

pressed this cause myself, directly with the Commissioners

concerned.  We will continue to do so.





<p>

Finally, and of particular relevance to this audience, we are

developing closer links with the private sector.  Many of my

senior officials attended a seminar at Chevening earlier this

month with key members of the private sector.  We set out to

consider how to extract the full benefits from ODA's

relationship with the private sector, pass on best practice, and

learn from each other's huge range of experience.  We sought in

particular to get the message across to business about what we

are doing, and the benefits to both business and ODA from closer

co-operation.

<p>

Where do we go from here/Listening to you I see today as an

important part of a wider process of increasing contacts between

government and the private sector on development issues.





<p>

Where then do we go from here?  Let me put forward some specific

ideas.





<p>

We want to look more systematically at how Government - through

the aid programme and through our international policies - can

help facilitate private sector investment in poorer countries. 

To achieve this, we want to learn from you.  What are the

barriers which you see to this process, and what do you believe

we can do to help overcome these?





<p>

We want to develop dialogue in particular areas where we can

co-operate more closely, and where you have particular

expertise.  Examples of this are privatisation and financial

restructuring.  I believe that ODA can help provide a link in

these areas to other governments.

<p>

I want to carry forward the recent meeting in the City which

explored the growing opportunities for investment in private

finance institutions.





<p>

We will ensure that our programme managers consult business in

the preparation of country and sector strategies and research

programmes; and that we look for opportunities for cooperation. 

Many British companies already run developmental projects as

part of their overseas investments to improve local education,

health and in other areas.  We are ready to share our experience

and expertise in such cases.





<p>

We will look at how to make more information available in

electronic form, as part of a new Business Information Strategy.





<p>

We will develop short term staff attachments and exchanges with

the private sector, both to work on particular projects, and to

learn from each other's experience.





<p>

Conclusion<br>







I believe that these ideas will help to provide a better basis

for us to work in partnership on what I have described as a

wider development agenda.





<p>

This is an agenda which stretches far wider than development

assistance.  It encompasses wider government policies, and the

private sector.  It is an agenda which the UK is active in

promoting, and it is an agenda to which ODA is responding by

developing its own role, in ways which I have sought to

describe.  It is an agenda which is producing success stories -

though there is far to go.





<p>

These are themes which strike a particular personal chord.  I

have always believed that the roles of the private sector and

government are complementary.  Britain has a major interest in

promoting the growth and prosperity of potential trading

partners in the developing world.





<p>

I am delighted to have had the opportunity of speaking to you

today on these themes.  Thank you.

Over the past weeks, several reporters belonging to the unofficial Independent Cuban Press Bureau (BPIC) have been arrested or threatened by state security officials.<p>On 19 January Luis Solar Hernandez, BPICs religious affairs correspondent, was detained in the town of Ciego de Avila while waitingto catch a train to Havana. He was held for a day and then released, but his book of contacts and other personal effects were confiscated.<p>The same day security officers also visited Roxana Valdivia, a BPIC reporter based in Ciego de Avila, and summoned her to appear at state security headquarters. She was warned for breaching an order imposed on her inOctober 1995 not to receive dissidents in her house. Hernandez had been visiting Valdivia prior to his arrest.<p>Juan Antonio Sanchez, a reporter for another independent agency, Cubapress, was also arrested by state security police in Havana on 14 January, while visiting the home of poet Raul Rivero.

They operate in defiance of government restrictions on the press, accordingto which all media are owned by the state and all journalists must belongto the official journalists' union. The only outlet BPIC, Cubapress and Havana Press have for their reports is with foreign news agencies and media, mainly in Miami.<p>Since the release from prison of BPIC's president, Yndamiro Restano, in June last year, the climate for independent journalism has improved slightly. Police harassment and threats are common, but the full weightof legal sanction, for offences such as clandestine printing or subversion, has not lately been brought to bear against reporters working outside the official system.<p>However, the latest wave of harassment - which began with the brief arrest of Restano's parents on 10 January - has caused some concern for Restano's own safety among his colleagues. He is currently travelling abroad, and there are doubts as to whether he will be permitted to return home and continue working.<hr></BODY></HTML>

<title>PRESS RELEASE - RESTRICTIONS ON WOMEN LEAD TO WITHDRAWAL FROM WESTERN AFGHANISTAN</title>

<h3>RESTRICTIONS ON WOMEN LEAD TO WITHDRAWAL FROM WESTERN AFGHANISTAN</h3>

Thursday 7 March 1996 <p>


Save the Children (UK) has suspended its operations in western Afghanistan. The
decision follows the implementation of new regulations by the Taliban authorities
in Herat over recent months, which have placed severe restrictions on the
employment of women and the access of women and girls to basic services.<p>


In the light of these developments, Save the Children issued a statement today
calling on humanitarian aid organisations working in Afghanistan to: <p>
<ul>

<li>suspend education programmes in areas where girls and women are denied
access to education (following the example set by UNICEF); <p>


<li> consider suspending non-emergency programmes in sectors where women's employment is prohibited by regional authorities; <p>


<li>continue to seek practical ways in which women and children can be
involved in programmes designed to help them, which are acceptable to
Afghan culture and traditions.</ul><p>


Save the Children's decision to suspend operations in the region has been taken
reluctantly and primarily on practical grounds. During the six months since Taliban
forces took over Herat, Save the Children has found it increasingly difficult to
pursue its work in the areas of education and health. <p>


All girl's schools in the Herat region have been closed indefinitely. The denial of
access to education for girls and young women, and the impact even on boy's


schools of the loss of women teachers, have cast doubt on the sustainability of any
further support to education.<p>


Since January, women have been prevented from working (outside the home and
health sector). These new restrictions on women's employment remove any
opportunity for Save the Children to consult and communicate directly with Afghan
women, who are the main carers of children. This in turn makes it impossible for
the agency to measure the long term effectiveness of its work. 

<p>




<h4>NOTES FOR EDITORS:</h4>
1. This initiative is backed by Save the Children (US) and Radda Barnen (Sweden),
who are both International Save the Children Alliance members currently based in
Afghanistan. The Alliance is an association of Save the Children organisations
throughout the world.<br>
2. Save the Children (UK) has been working in Afghanistan and with Afghan
regugees in Pakistan since the mid 1970s. <p>

<I>Les dysfonctionnements de l'aide s'expliquent par la tendance
des donateurs et des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, individus ou
institutions, &agrave; privil&eacute;gier leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
de court terme. La multiplication des acteurs de la coop&eacute;ration
n'a pas encore permis de se doter d'un projet collectif dont l'aide
favoriserait l'application.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Rares sont les conf&eacute;rences des Nations unies o&ugrave;
la communaut&eacute; des donateurs ne r&eacute;affirme pas son
engagement d'accro&icirc;tre l'effort financier en direction des
pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Consacrer &agrave; l'aide 0,7 %
du produit national brut reste l'objectif sans cesse renouvel&eacute;.
Rares aussi sont les pays qui n'op&egrave;rent pas dans la foul&eacute;e
des sommets internationaux des coupes drastiques dans les budgets
de l'aide, le pire dans ce domaine restant probablement &agrave;
venir. Hach&eacute;e autour d'enjeux th&eacute;matiques et focalis&eacute;e
sur les volumes financiers, la discussion sur l'&eacute;volution
de l'aide reste floue...
<P>
L'aide fait intervenir une multitude d'acteurs dont les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts,
les buts et les modes d'action sont loin d'&ecirc;tre transparents
et coh&eacute;rents. Or imaginons une entreprise en difficult&eacute;
qui devrait n&eacute;gocier s&eacute;par&eacute;ment avec une
quinzaine de gros clients et une myriade de petits les orientations
de sa production, les normes de ses produits, la r&eacute;mun&eacute;ration
de ses salari&eacute;s, la planification de ses investissements,
etc. sachant que chacun de ses clients aurait une id&eacute;e
particuli&egrave;re de ce que devrait &ecirc;tre cette entreprise
! Difficile de concevoir dans ces conditions un projet coh&eacute;rent.
C'est pourtant ce qui arrive &agrave; plus d'un pays pauvre dot&eacute;
de ses bailleurs bilat&eacute;raux, multilat&eacute;raux, organisations
non gouvernementales (ONG), coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e,
sans parler des banques de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
Longtemps, donateurs publics et ONG se sont affront&eacute;s sur
les mod&egrave;les de d&eacute;veloppement qui fondaient leurs
interventions. Sous couvert de non-ing&eacute;rence dans les affaires
int&eacute;rieures des pays, l'aide publique internationale appuyait
les politiques des &Eacute;tats. Guerre froide aidant, l'aide
&eacute;tait un puissant levier pour renforcer une influence strat&eacute;gique
et politique que les Trente glorieuses permettaient de financer.
Pour les pays africains, il s'agissait &eacute;galement d'appuyer
la construction des nouveaux &Eacute;tats ind&eacute;pendants
et de cr&eacute;er les infrastructures de base n&eacute;cessaires
au d&eacute;veloppement et qui permettraient de rattraper le Nord.
Contestant le mod&egrave;le de d&eacute;veloppement capitaliste
de ces derniers, consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme universel par les
bailleurs publics, les ONG pr&ocirc;naient pour leur part des
mod&egrave;les alternatifs, fond&eacute;s sur les d&eacute;veloppement
autocentr&eacute;, la participation populaire et les r&eacute;alisations
&agrave; la base.
<P>
La mise en place des infrastructures (routes, administrations,
&eacute;ducation) n'a pas suffi pour faire d&eacute;coller l'&eacute;conomie.
Les &Eacute;tats du Sud se sont enfonc&eacute;s dans la crise,
coinc&eacute;s entre les remboursements de la dette et la chute
des cours mondiaux des mati&egrave;re premi&egrave;res. Les enjeux
g&eacute;ostrat&eacute;giques se sont effrit&eacute;s et les bailleurs,
qui remettaient malgr&eacute; tout la main &agrave; la poche chaque
ann&eacute;e, ont eu tendance &agrave; s'aligner sur les th&egrave;ses
de la Banque mondiale et du Fonds mon&eacute;taire international.
<P>
Les actions &agrave; petite &eacute;chelle n'ont pas r&eacute;ussi
&agrave; engendrer un syst&egrave;me &eacute;conomique alternatif
cr&eacute;dible. En revanche, elles ont pu soutenir des dynamiques
collectives qu'elles prenaient le temps de comprendre. Elles ont
&eacute;galement permis d'implanter de multiples micro-infrastructures
(sant&eacute;, &eacute;ducation, gestion de l'eau, formation des
responsables, etc.). Aujourd'hui, face &agrave; la victoire du
lib&eacute;ralisme ent&eacute;rin&eacute;e par l'effondrement
des &eacute;conomies socialistes de l'Est, la conversion implicite
&agrave; l'&eacute;conomie de march&eacute; de la Chine et du
Vietnam, la plupart des ONG acceptent le cadre macro-&eacute;conomique
de leurs interventions. Elles ne le contestent plus que du bout
des l&egrave;vres dans les enceintes des conf&eacute;rences internationales.
<P>
<H3>Logiques r&eacute;gionales</H3>
<P>
On assiste en r&eacute;alit&eacute;
au renforcement des logiques r&eacute;gionales de l'aide. Bien
qu'elle s'en d&eacute;fende, l'Union europ&eacute;enne consacre
des moyens financiers croissants aux pays avec lesquels elle &eacute;labore
une strat&eacute;gie &eacute;conomique r&eacute;gionale. L'aide
aux pays d'Europe centrale et orientale est dans le droit fil
de leur int&eacute;gration prochaine dans l'Union, celles aux
pays m&eacute;diterran&eacute;ens et aux pays du C&ocirc;ne Sud
de l'Am&eacute;rique latine s'inscrivent dans la perspective de
futures zones de libre-&eacute;change. A c&ocirc;t&eacute; des
enjeux r&eacute;gionaux existent des programmes d'aide &agrave;
but politique, comme en Palestine et en Russie.
<P>
Les pays traditionnellement b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, l'Afrique
avant tout, sont les premiers &agrave; souffrir de la rigueur
budg&eacute;taire nouvelle des &Eacute;tats donateurs. Mais le
volume financier affect&eacute; &agrave; l'aide constitue-t-il
r&eacute;ellement le fond du d&eacute;bat ? La discussion sur
les flux d'aide occulte malheureusement la vraie question, celle
de la qualit&eacute; de l'aide et du projet de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
Le label &#171;aide au d&eacute;veloppement&#187; couvre des interventions
tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rentes. Qu'y a-t-il de commun entre des
op&eacute;rations d'urgence men&eacute;es par une ONG ou par les
militaires fran&ccedil;ais, une aide &agrave; la balance des paiements
octroy&eacute;e par un &Eacute;tat pour honorer la dette multilat&eacute;rale,
un projet de voirie municipale dans le cadre d'une coop&eacute;ration
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, un barrage construit par un b&eacute;tonneur
fran&ccedil;ais, un projet de d&eacute;veloppement rural int&eacute;gr&eacute;
appuy&eacute; par un consortium d'ONG et financ&eacute; par une
agence publique ? Toutes ces interventions ext&eacute;rieures
finissent par dessiner un syst&egrave;me &agrave; part enti&egrave;re,
dont nul ne peut garantir la coh&eacute;rence interne. L'Afrique
s'est ainsi progressivement install&eacute;e dans l'&eacute;conomie
de l'aide, qui forme en d&eacute;finitive un march&eacute; comme
un autre. En effet, les institutions &eacute;tatiques ont d&ucirc;
r&eacute;duire leur train de vie &agrave; la suite des coupes
effectu&eacute;es dans le budget g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et les
budgets sectoriels. Par cons&eacute;quent, les fonctionnaires
n'ont pas d'autre choix que de monter un projet qui leur permette
d'assumer leur mission et leur apporte un salaire suppl&eacute;mentaire
(la prime des bailleurs aux bons &eacute;l&eacute;ments avec lesquels
il est enfin possible de travailler...). Pour &eacute;viter de
r&eacute;p&eacute;ter les erreurs pass&eacute;es, les agences
de coop&eacute;ration h&eacute;sitent &agrave; confier ces projets
&agrave; l'administration et pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent soutenir
des dispositifs para-&eacute;tatiques. Le manque de coordination
entre ces agences conduit &agrave; une mosa&iuml;que d'institutions
souvent peu viables et peu coh&eacute;rentes. L'autre fa&ccedil;on
pour les fonctionnaires de se soustraire &agrave; la cure d'amaigrissement
forc&eacute;e consiste &agrave; cr&eacute;er une ONG et drainer
les cr&eacute;dits allou&eacute;s d&eacute;sormais par les agences
aux acteurs priv&eacute;s locaux, fer de lance des strat&eacute;gies
de d&eacute;veloppement post-ajustement !
<P>
<H3>Projet collectif</H3>
<P>
Mon propos n'est pas de remettre en cause
l'abandon par l'&Eacute;tat d'une s&eacute;rie de pr&eacute;rogatives
qu'il assume moins bien que le march&eacute;. Il s'agit de d&eacute;terminer
comment proc&eacute;der &agrave; cette rupture. L'aide se pourrait
&ecirc;tre un instrument de d&eacute;mocratisation des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
et de maturation d'un projet collectif. L&agrave; r&eacute;side
la principale distinction entre aide et coop&eacute;ration.
<P>
La tendance des &Eacute;tats africains &agrave; exiger une aide
financi&egrave;re en compensation de leurs difficult&eacute;s
&agrave; s'ins&eacute;rer dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale &eacute;claire
d'ailleurs cette diff&eacute;rence. En effet, les pays africains
ont &eacute;t&eacute; peu pr&eacute;sents au cours des discussions
multilat&eacute;rales du cycle d'Uruguayt. Faute d'avoir n&eacute;goci&eacute;
les conditions de leur participation aux &eacute;changes internationaux
et d'acc&egrave;s &agrave; leurs march&eacute;s, ils voulaient
obtenir un accroissement de l'aide en contrepartie d'un accord
qui semblait contraire &agrave; leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts. Alors
que le <I>dumping</I> sur les march&eacute;s mondiaux semble expliquer
en grande partie les difficult&eacute;s de l'agriculture vivri&egrave;re
africaine &agrave; satisfaire les besoins de la population, les
&Eacute;tats sollicitaient une hausse de l'aide alimentaire et
des aides &agrave; la balance commerciale ! Et comme de surcro&icirc;t
il convient d'appliquer ces accords, de mettre en conformit&eacute;
les l&eacute;gislations nationales et de former les op&eacute;rateurs
commerciaux, les &Eacute;tats africains et les agences sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es
des Nations unies vont d&eacute;velopper de multiples programmes
d'assistance technique, n&eacute;goci&eacute;s entre fonctionnaires
mais bien s&ucirc;r pour le compte des acteurs priv&eacute;s.
Et tout le monde de se retourner comme un seul homme vers les
bailleurs de fonds. L'aide &agrave; court terme prend d&egrave;s
lors le pas sur une strat&eacute;gie de d&eacute;veloppement &agrave;
long terme.
<P>
En v&eacute;rit&eacute;, la coop&eacute;ration implique l'existence
d'au moins deux partenaires dot&eacute;s d'un projet commun. La
crise de la coop&eacute;ration s'interpr&egrave;te d&egrave;s
lors comme une insuffisance du projet ou une perte de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;
et de capacit&eacute; des partenaires. Sait-on seulement, apr&egrave;s
bient&ocirc;t quinze ans d'ajustement en Afrique, de quel projet
collectif les Africains se sont dot&eacute;s avec l'appui de la
communaut&eacute; internationale ?

<h3>Programme Overview </h3>

<p>ACTIONAID began work in Burundi in 1976 with a range of country-wide development initiatives. In
1988,
the focus shifted to the eastern communities of Ruyigi and Bweru in Ruyigi province, which today
remains
the main ACTIONAID programme area.

<p>ACTIONAID's long-term development work was suspended in 1993 following the coup d'tat in October
of that year. An emergency relief programme was instigated to help the thousands of displaced within
the country.

<p>In 1996 the threat of significant outbreaks of violent conflict continues to hang over Burundi.
However, the ACTIONAID programme in Ruyigi province has recommenced, helping communities in the
area return to their homes and organise so that they can plan which development projects to
implement. The priorities for ACTIONAID's work with the villagers will be seed credit schemes,
protection of
water sources, developing income generation and training of community health workers.   
<hr>
<h3>Examples of ACTIONAID's work in Burundi:</h3>

<p><ul><li>the core of ACTIONAID's work before the coup was an adult literacy programme, helping 500
learners each year develop the skills and confidence to make more informed choices about their lives.

<p><li>the October 1993 coup left 150,000 people dead, 700,000 displaced and caused an estimated $79
million of damage. The communities ACTIONAID was working with experienced some of the most serious
fighting and fled the province. ACTIONAID worked with local groups through 1994 to distribute seeds,
tools
and shelter materials to 20,000 families. By May, 98 per cent of the families had been able to plant
the
seed and were looking forward to a good harvest.

<p>
New ACP Secretary-General</I>. Ng'andu Peter Magande, is no stranger to the challenge of development at the
grassroots. The new Secretary-General of the <A HREF="../../acpsec/index.html">ACP Group</A>, who was born in 1947,
began his working career as a provincial development officer, planning and
supervising projects in the Southern Province of his native Zambia. He is an
economics graduate of the University of Zambia and also holds a master's degree
in agricultural economics from Makerere University, Uganda. From working in the field, he moved into government administration, rising to the
position of Permanent Secretary - a post which he held in a number of ministries.
Since the mid-1980s, he has had key jobs in a number of Zambian enterprises
(including Managing Director of the Zambia National Commercial Bank). His most
recent work has been on a project to develop private sector participation in
agricultural input and produce marketing.

Dans un document de prise de position sur la Conf&#233;rence intergouvernementale des dirigeants europ&#233;ens qui d&#233;butera en mars de cette ann&#233;e, le Comit&#233; de liaison des organisations non gouvernementales, qui regroupe les ONG de d&#233;veloppement &#224; l'&#233;chelon europ&#233;en, r&#233;clame davantage de "coh&#233;rence" entre la politique de d&#233;veloppement de l'Union europ&#233;enne  et d'autres politiques communautaires telles que l'agriculture.
<p>
On sait que la CIG 1996 envisagera d'importantes r&#233;formes des institutions de l'Union mais les ONG craignent que la politique de d&#233;veloppement en soit omise, bien que le Trait&#233; de Maastricht ait entam&#233; cette r&#233;forme au Titre XVII sur la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement en s'engageant &#224; promouvoir:
<ul>
<li>le d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et social durable des pays en d&#233;veloppement et plus particuli&#232;rement des plus d&#233;savantag&#233;s d'entre eux ;
<li>l'insertion harmonieuse et progressive des pays en d&#233;veloppement dans l'&#233;conomie mondiale ;
<li>la lutte contre la pauvret&#233; dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement.
</ul>
<p>
Les ONG regrettent toutefois que le processus de Maastricht ne se soit "pas encore traduit par une am&#233;lioration d&#233;terminante de l'impact des programmes de d&#233;veloppement de l'Union sur les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires". Le pr&#233;judice caus&#233; aux producteurs locaux par le "dumping" de la viande bovine communautaire subventionn&#233;e sur les march&#233;s ouest-africains est l'exemple par excellence de ce manque de coh&#233;rence, affirment les ONG.
<p>
La CIG offre l'opportunit&#233; de "placer les relations avec le monde en d&#233;veloppement plus pr&#232;s du centre des fondements juridiques et institutionnels de l'Europe" et de "supprimer les contradictions par lesquelles la politique de d&#233;veloppement d&#233;clar&#233;e est amoindrie par la pratique dans des domaines d'activit&#233; importants de l'Union", ajoutent-elles. Il convient d'affermir les fondements d'une politique communautaire de d&#233;veloppement au sein des institutions europ&#233;ennes pour &#233;viter, selon les ONG toujours, que l'UE r&#233;oriente encore davantage ses priorit&#233;s vers la Communaut&#233; des Etats Ind&#233;pendants (CEI), l'Europe centrale et orientale - dont certains pays sont d&#233;j&#224; candidats &#224; l'adh&#233;sion - et la M&#233;diterran&#233;e.
<p>
Le rapport pr&#233;cise que "plusieurs des nouveaux membres potentiels ne sont que peu engag&#233;s actuellement dans la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement en Afrique, en Asie et en Am&#233;rique latine. Ils s'occupent surtout de leur propre transformation &#233;conomique."
<p>
Les recommandations du document adress&#233; &#224; la CIG portent sur le renforcement du Titre XVII de Maastricht et, par cons&#233;quent, sur les femmes et le d&#233;veloppement, le partenariat, la budg&#233;tisation de Lom&#233;, l'aide d'urgence, la r&#233;habilitation et la pr&#233;paration aux catastrophes ainsi que sur la coordination avec les organisations internationales.
<p>
Il r&#233;clame une priorit&#233; en ce qui concerne la pr&#233;vention des conflits, avec la cr&#233;ation d'une "cellule de pr&#233;vention" et la mise en place d'une "politique d'exportation des armements". "La premi&#232;re mesure en faveur d'une politique efficace d'exportation des armes serait, pour le Conseil des Ministres, de faire des contr&ocirc;les &#224; l'exportation des armes l'objet d'une proc&#233;dure d'action conjointe, en adoptant un code de conduite ayant force ex&#233;cutoire aux plus hauts niveaux de contr&ocirc;le", pr&#233;cise le rapport.
<p>
Il conviendrait de veiller &#224; plus de coh&#233;rence non seulement dans le domaine agricole mais &#233;galement dans le cadre d'actions telles que la politique d'immigration et d'asile, y compris "un transfert progressif des comp&#233;tences en mati&#232;re d'immigration et d'asile vers l'Union, afin de parvenir &#224; des politiques communes fond&#233;es sur des limitations r&#233;alistes et sur des consid&#233;rations humanitaires".
<p>
Les ONG europ&#233;ennes de d&#233;veloppement ont pr&#233;vu de tenir,  imm&#233;diatement apr&#232;s leur assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale annuelle des 18 et 19 avril (soit le 19 et le 20 avril), une r&#233;union de r&#233;flexion sur diff&#233;rents sc&#233;narios faisant intervenir la politique de d&#233;veloppement et la CIG. Un Sommet des dirigeants europ&#233;ens pour le lancement de la CIG aura lieu &#224; Turin (Italie) le 29 mars 1996.

<h3><font face="arial, helvetica">Programme Overview</font></h3>

<p>ACTIONAID started working in Vietnam in 1991. Programmes in two areas of the country are now
helping more than 20,000 people in the poorest communities who have not benefited from the move
towards a market economy. 

<p>The emphasis is on helping to improve agricultural production and establishing savings and credit
schemes so families have access to cash without being subject to the exorbitant rates of interest
charged by informal money lenders. ACTIONAID works  in partnership with government and local
organisations so that the skills and expertise they develop stays with the communities for the
long-term future.

<h3><font face="arial, helvetica">Examples of ACTIONAID's work in Vietnam</font></h3>
<b>ACTIONAID has:</b>

<p><ul><li>been working with more than 3,000 households in Son La Province to help improve land
productivity. By talking to a wide cross-section of people, including villagers and state officials,
ACTIONAID  passes on new farming techniques and skills. Demonstration plots were established to show
how to protect poor upland terrain from erosion by planting hedges. Training, the key to long-term
success, is carried out through a network of government staff and volunteers.

<p><li>worked with The Women's Union to set up savings and credit schemes to give women more control
over the small resources they do have. By saving small amounts each week, members of the scheme can
then take loans to buy much needed tools, seeds or food during the hungry period.

Rebirth of East Africa Cooperation</h2>
<h4>by <i>Debra Percival</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>The Courier ACP-EU</i><br>No. 157, May-June 1996: page 24</h4>
<h5>(Note: this text may differ slightly from the printed version)
</h5>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<B>
Daniel arap Moi, Yoweri Museveni and Benjamain Mkapa, the Presidents
of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania respectively, met in Arusha in mid-March
to sign an agreement setting up a Secretariat for the new system
of East African Cooperation.</B>
<P>
 The old East African Community fell into abeyance during the
1960s and a lot of hope is being placed by the Kenyan government
and traders in particular on its relaunch, as a way of boosting
external investment, local manufacturing and trade between the
three countries. Kenya's current trade statistics with its two
East African neighbours show that there is considerable scope
for trade cooperation. In fact, Kenya's exports to Tanzania and
Uganda have already been gathering pace (Uganda has overtaken
Britain as Kenya's number one export market), but Kenya's imports
from its two East African neighbours remain sluggish (see table).
<P>
 There is a lot of anticipation that, in a potential market of
80 million people, production can be increased, with reduced tariffs
leading to an upsurge of trade in local products.<I> Micah Cheserem,</I>
Governor of Kenya's central bank, was one of many government officials
whom <I>The Courier</I> met who was upbeat about the new regional
body. 'East African cooperation is going to happen and there will
be convertibility of currencies', he stressed. 'EAC will be one
of the building blocs of African unity.' Mr Cheserem sees Kenya
becoming East Africa's banking centre. The country already has
38 commercial banks, six development finance institutions, 44
non-bank financial institutions, 9 foreign exchange bureaus and
40 insurance companies (figures for August 1995).
<P>
 Up until recently, the development of cooperation between the
countries of the old East African Community has been dogged by
political differences. The former leaders of the region - socialist
President <I>Julius Nyerere</I> of Tanzania, Kenya's pro-western
President, <I>Jomo Kenyatta</I> and Ugandan dictator, <I>Idi Amin</I>
proved to be uneasy bedfellows.
<P>
 The final collapse of the East African Community, which survived
for a decade up until 1977, was provoked by disagreements over
the benefits gained by each state from the operation of common
regional services such as the airline, harbours and telecommunications.
More recently, political divisions between Kenya and Uganda have
hindered the work of the 1994 East African Permanent Tripartite
Commission, which was set up to ease the way for normalised relations
between the three neighbours.
<P>
 Uganda was accused by Kenya of harbouring 'subversive elements'
hostile to the latter, notably in the shape of Kenyan refugee,
<I>John Odongo</I>. President Moi requested Odongo's extradition,
claiming that he was a rebel who sought to overthrow the government.
Uganda refused and subsequently found a new home for its 'guest'
in Ghana. Uganda has also complained that Kenya has allowed some
high profile Ugandan dissidents to reside there. Then there was
question of the unpaid sum of $90 million said to be owed by Kenya
to Uganda under the 1984 East African Compensation Fund Agreement.
This Agreement was negotiated to sort out financial matters pertaining
to the East African Community's collapse in 1977. Finally, relations
between the two states were soured by differences over Rwanda,
with Uganda accusing Kenya of allowing some of the alleged perpetrators
of the 1994 massacre to live in Kenya. 
<P>
 The highly publicised symbolic handshake between Presidents Moi
and Museveni, which took place at the end of January, suggests
that the two leaders have now buried the hatchet. A Secretary-General
for the new EAC, who should have been appointed a year ago by
Kenya, was finally chosen in mid-March. He is <I>Francis Muthura,</I>
formerly Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations in New York.
He will obviously face some big challenges in converting the goals
set out in the new agreement into concrete results. But the outlook
for fruitful regional cooperation, and the benefits that should
flow from this, are now more promising than ever before.

His aim was to foster relations with other countries, and over the past 75 years the Urdd has supported humanitarian projects from Bosnia to Brazil. Each year a Message of peace and goodwill is sent round the world. Over 90 countries receive the message, and many reply in support. The Urdd has been working very closely with UNICEF in Wales, and last year they raised over £5,000 through an International Children's Concert at the Urdd Eisteddfod and a 5-day 'singathon'.<p>To celebrate UNICEF's 50th anniversary, this year's message focuses on children and UNICEF's work: &quot;We the children of Wales call upon the children of the world to join us in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary by supporting the aims of UNICEF and by demanding justice for all the children of the world.&quot;<p><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=right>Check out for children</h3><img align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 src="pg6a.jpg"><br>THE Check out for Children partnership between UNICEF and ITT Sheraton is on target to raise half a million pounds in its first year. The initiative, launched in Europe at the end of 1995, will be rolled out to the Asia Pacific division in the next few months. The scheme adds an optional $1 or its equivalent (£1 in the UK) to the bill of each guest staying at the ITT Sheraton hotels in Europe and Israel. The initiative has been warmly received by ITT Sheraton's guests and in the first six months raised nearly £250,000. Robert Cotter, President of ITT Sheraton Europe division, said: &quot;Each of our European hotels has welcomed the initiative and our guests, who are the generous supporters in this project, have applauded the scheme and have been more than happy to give. We look forward to rolling the programme out in other divisions of ITT Sheraton&quot;. As a mark of their confidence in the success of Check Out for Children, ITT Sheraton has pledged and guaranteed the anticipated funds for the rest of the year - a grand total of £500,000.<p><small>Mr Robert Cotter (left), President ITT Sheraton Europe Division, presents a cheque for £500,000 to HRH The Duchess of Kent, Patron of the UK Committee for UNICEF and Richard Reid of UNICEF, at an event at the Park Lane Hotel, London.&copy;Always Photography</small><p><hr width=71%><p><h3 align=right>Sunflower festival in Hampstead</h3><img align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 src="pg6b.jpg">THE Hampstead Chapter of the Sokkai Ghakki Buddhist Group, who are supporting UNICEF nationally throughout 1996, organised a Sunflower Festival at the Kings College Campus in Hampstead. The rooms were festooned with sunflowers of every shape, hanging from the lights and decorating the walls, as well as real sunflowers on every table. Children's faces were painted with sunflowers and even one bald head was adorned with a painting of the flower!

<hr><h2>Summary: </h2><p>
The promotion of 'good government' has become an explicit objective of
most aid donors.  This has raised suspicions in developing countries,
particularly when the threat of withholding aid has been used to force
multi-party elections.  But experience is showing that the good government
agenda is less threatening than it first appeared, and provides opportunities
for improving the quality of aid.  Good government principles are here to stay,
and - if applied consistently, openly and intelligently - can bring benefits
for both recipients and donors.<p>
<p>
<hr><h2>What is meant by 'Good Government'?</h2><p>
The term 'good government' entered the aid vocabulary in the early
1990s.  Definitions of what it means vary.  For most donors, the main
ingredients are:<p>
<LI>	democracy (particularly multi-party democracy);<p>
<LI>	respect for human rights and the rule of law;<p>
<LI>	efficiency, accountability and transparency in government and public
administration.<p>
For some donors, good government also embraces: <p>
<LI>	popular participation; <p>
<LI>	equity and poverty concerns;<p>
<LI>	a commitment to market-oriented economic policies.<p>
Disagreement among donors on the content of the good government agenda means
they have pursued distinct, sometimes contradictory policies, and have failed
to give clear signals to recipients about what they are trying to achieve.
This has confused the picture, and diluted the impact of good government
initiatives.<p>
<p>
<hr><h2>What's new - and why now?</h2><p>
There is nothing new in many of the aims of good government policies, or
in the approaches used to pursue them.  What is new is that donors are putting
more emphasis on using aid to promote good government, and are devoting more
resources to it. There are several reasons for this. <p>
<LI>	the end of the Cold War and the collapse of Communism undermined the
case for giving aid to repressive and undemocratic governments simply because
they were anti-Communist.  Democracy could be promoted as an objective in its
own right.<p>
<LI>	a growing belief that 'bad government' has been undermining development.
Corruption, poor control of public funds, lack of accountability, human rights
abuses, and excessive military expenditure, have all been blamed for holding
back development - particularly in Africa. <p>
<LI>	the conviction among donors that aid will be more acceptable to
taxpayers if it is seen to promote democracy and human rights. <p>
The end of the Cold War was the trigger that allowed these concerns to be
packaged together under the single `good government' heading.<p>
<hr><h2>The punitive approach</h2><p>
Aid donors are implementing good government policies through a range of
measures.  These can be broadly divided into two sets:  positive (the carrot)
and punitive (the stick).<p>
With the punitive approach, aid is made conditional on the recipient government
adhering to political conditions set by donors. Failure to do so can result in
aid being reduced, suspended, and in extreme circumstances, terminated.  The
key objective is to promote political reform, usually in the form of
multi-party democracy, together with progress on human rights.<p>
In practice,<u> </u>the punitive approach has been used sparingly, and often
only as the last resort when conventional diplomatic pressures have failed.
Where it has been applied, it has not always had the desired effect. <p>
In 1992, donors publicly presented the Kenyan government with a virtual
ultimatum - hold free multi-party elections or aid will be severely cut. This
caused a stir, partly because Kenya had previously been seen as a close ally of
Western donors.<p>
Donors achieved their objective in the sense that multi-party elections were
held (in December 1992). However, the outcome was that the existing government
was able to take advantage of its influence over the electoral process to split
the opposition, and gain re-election on the basis of a small share of votes
polled.  Ethnic tensions were heavily exploited in campaigning, leaving Kenyan
society in a weakened state, and undermining its development prospects. <p>
Punitive measures have also been taken against Haiti, Malawi, Somalia, Sudan
and Zaire, but again with mixed results. <p>
All this has convinced some donors to downplay the punitive approach.  Canada,
for example, has abandoned it as a mechanism for furthering good government.
France has diluted its commitment to democracy promotion as a key policy
objective. And in May 1994 the Clinton administration reversed its policy of
linking preferential trade benefits to China to an improvement in human rights.
However the United States has not discarded the punitive approach completely,
and in some cases has been willing to back aid sanctions with military force to
restore democracy - Haiti being the most recent example. <p>
Most donors will no doubt continue to use aid as a bargaining counter to affect
the composition and behaviour of governments.  The difference is that now they
are doing this quietly, rather than overtly.<p>
<hr><h2>The positive approach</h2><p>
Aid donors also employ a wide array of positive aid measures - mostly
involving institution-building - to encourage good government.  They fall into
two main categories:<p>
Public sector reforms (advocated, in particular, by the World Bank):<p>
<LI>	promoting better management of the public sector;<p>
<LI>	encouraging civil service reforms;<p>
<LI>	pushing for greater accountability and transparency in government;<p>
<LI>	strengthening the legal system and training the police.<p>
Political reforms:<p>
<LI>	training journalists and promoting a free press;<p>
<LI>	supporting human rights groups and other civic and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs);<p>
<LI>	providing election monitoring;<p>
<LI>	encouraging constitutional reform; <p>
<LI>	assisting new political parties.<p>
The positive approach has been less controversial than the punitive, and has on
the whole been more successful.  But it is not without its problems.<p>
Institution-building projects tend to be small-scale and long-term.  They
require patience and flexibility on the part of donors, and are difficult to
manage and appraise.  Donors have found it hard to spend money in this area.
Providing too much money to organizations, too quickly, runs the risk of
undermining their effectiveness and legitimacy.<p>
<hr><h2>Is national sovereignty threatened?</h2><p>
Good government policies are intended to be a threat to Third
World governments who abuse human rights, or are corrupt and undemocratic.
Using aid to counter these tendencies may threaten governments, but can
help those who suffer under them - donors argue. <p>
However, even those who favour democracy and respect for human rights are wary
of donor intentions.  Donors are promoting a particular type of government -
multi-party democracy.  What right have they to interfere in the internal
politics of countries by prescribing this form of government?<p>
If positive rather than punitive measures become the norm in future, then
recipients may feel less threatened.  But critics remain suspicious that donors
are using good government arguments as a convenient excuse to cut aid
budgets.<p>
One of the clear benefits of good government pressures is that they are helping
to shift the debate within Third World countries.  People are hearing terms
such as accountability, transparency, anti-corruption, and beginning to use
them themselves to raise questions.  Are government organizations doing their
job?  Do we get value from large parastatal foodgrain corporations that fail to
provide cheap and reliable food supplies and run enormous deficits?  Why is the
press not able to investigate allegations of high level corruption?<p>
People feel more confident about raising these kind of questions when their
governments are also under international pressure to take these issues
seriously. <p>
<p>
<hr><h2>Contradictions </h2><p>
At present, the good government agenda is full of contradictions.  Apart
from donors defining it in different ways, there are glaring inconsistencies in
the way it is applied.  Some of the most obvious are:<p>
<LI>	the fact that donors continue to provide substantial aid and trading
privileges to some powerful and influential countries such as China and
Indonesia, despite clear evidence of human rights abuses.<p>
<LI>	the fact that some of the donor nations most active in promoting good
government have themselves been among the largest suppliers of military
equipment to the Third World.  Recent reductions in sales to some parts of the
Third World are not due to any change in policy.  They are because Western
suppliers are being priced out by tight budgets and competition from other
lower cost suppliers, like China.<p>
These examples show the conflicts between good intentions, and political
realities.  These may be inevitable.  But they do not strengthen Third World
confidence that good government policies are being applied consistently or
fairly.<p>
Other problems stem from conflicts between different elements in the good
government agenda. In July 1994, for example, the elected government of Gambia
was forced out of office.  Coup leaders alleged that the previous government,
which held power for 29 years, was corrupt.  The dilemma for donors was which
was more important:  supporting democracy, or rooting out corruption?  In cases
such as these, donors are forced to make difficult choices.  The USA announced
it would cut off aid. Britain opted for a middle course, saying that existing
aid commitments would be honoured but that no new ones would be made. <p>
And what if recipient governments change their policies and satisfy good
government criteria? Will there be more aid?  Not necessarily.  The German
government has recently increased aid to countries that have complied with good
government criteria, and cut funding for others.  But most donors have stopped
short of making hard and fast commitments.  <p>
<p>
<hr><h2>Views from the South</h2><p>
'Human rights begin with breakfast' - African delegate to a United Nations
conference. <p>
'The individual cannot really be a human being if his or her basic needs are
not met, and those basic needs include security, subsistence, health,
education'  Pierre San&eacute;, Senegal. (Secretary-General, Amnesty
International). <p>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister (at 1991 Commonwealth finance
ministers meeting), urged caution before 'we twist arms to force democracy
and all the other noble ideas and concepts down everyone's throats' ...  'the
Commonwealth should not just go along with the World Bank' in putting new
conditionalities on aid.<p>
'Economic linkages are the most important instrument we have' (Nigerian
civil rights lawyer, arguing in favour of tying aid to human rights).<p>
<hr><h2>Do donors practise what they preach?</h2><p>
Aid agencies have been justly criticized for failing to apply good
government principles to their own operations.  For example:<p>
<LI>	failing to consult properly with recipients;<p>
<LI>	being less than 'transparent' in their own dealings with recipients;<p>
<LI>	being hypocritical - advocating good government on one hand, while at
the same time funding dubious aid projects, such as dam schemes that leave
thousands displaced without proper compensation.<p>
The World Bank, which pioneered the notion of connecting aid with good
government, very quickly found the tables being turned against it.  The fact
that it has recently opened its operations to greater public scrutiny is due in
part to creative use of good government arguments by its critics.<p>
<p>
<hr><h2>The way forward</h2><p>
The good government agenda has moved on since it was first put forward.
The positive approach has gained ground, and use of aid as an explicit and
public means of forcing political change is being downplayed.  It has proved to
be a crude and unreliable tool.<p>
Instead, donors are resorting to the more traditional approach of applying
pressure behind the scenes.  In early 1994, action of this kind led to the
sacking from an African government of three Ministers against whom donors had
collected direct evidence of large-scale corruption.<p>
This more covert approach has the advantage of being more flexible, and more
likely to be effective - although it can be criticized for not being
transparent, and therefore breaking one of the basic rules of good
government.<p>
Looking ahead, the good government agenda is clearly here to stay.  Aid donors
have become attached to the principle, and have in many cases reorganized
themselves so they have an office or division dealing explicitly with these
issues.<p>
The 'good government' label may be too broad and diffuse, and may eventually
fall out of use.<u>  </u>But the principles behind it - that giving and
receiving aid are political processes, and that political issues should be
taken into account - are likely to be embedded in aid programmes for the
foreseeable future. <p>
There are a number of lessons to be learnt, however, if the potential benefits
of good government policies are to be reaped.<p>
For recipient countries:<p>
<LI>	the good government agenda has turned out to be less threatening than it
originally appeared. It is better for countries to grasp the agenda and turn it
to their advantage, than fight it.   <p>
<LI>	demonstrating progress in improving government performance and
addressing human rights issues should provide useful leverage in negotiating
better aid packages - although there are no guarantees. <p>
<LI>	countries should put pressure on donor countries to consult more, stop
'moving the goalposts', and practise what they preach.<p>
For donor countries:<p>
<LI>	greater clarity and consistency are crucial if good government policies
are to work.  Donors should coordinate their actions and seek to develop a more
coherent approach.<p>
<LI>	the good government agenda needs to be broadened to embrace the economic
dimension of human rights.  It is not tenable to argue for political freedoms
while at the same time promoting policies that make the poor worse off.<p>
<LI>	an open attack on military spending has yet to become a recognized
dimension of the good government agenda.  Until it does, this glaring
inconsistency will undermine the moral argument behind good government
policies.<p>
<LI>	if donors are serious about attacking Third World corruption they should
start by following the United States lead and make the payment of overseas
bribes by US citizens a criminal offence.<p>

Inside, Prof Saraswati Ali was warming to her point.'He's not a bad student,' she was saying to her colleagues, Professors Zuleikha O'Brien and Christine Krishnaswamy.'But his thesis on late Twentieth-Century Fundamentalism is what I would call deranged.'<p>'Surely that's not reason enough to consider flogging him?' asked Prof Zuleikha.'I had the impression that he was rather too cuddly for that!' It was well known that she had a weakness for her male students. There had been several complaints, but the University had always managed to hush them up.<p>The indicator on the entrance module purred.'Well, here he is now,' said Prof Christine, sucking on her substance simulator, currently set on'coke'. Sure enough, three seconds later, Elijah'Bunny' Mikimoto stepped out.He was short but well-muscled. He held his thesis shyly across his pelvic region. He wore natural plastic tights, ski boots and a moon-beam collar. His entire upper body was encased in a hologram of dense tattoos which gave him the appearance of being both chic and deeply vulnerable. He had electrolyzed his hair to give himself a fashionably mature bald pate. And his beard was maintained at precisely five o'clock-shadow length.<p>'It's your central idea, I'm afraid,' began Prof Saraswati.'This ridiculous notion that there are fundamentalists amongst us today! And that they are no different from the religious fundamentalists of the previous century...''I beg to disagree, M'lady Professor,' said Bunny, in his endearingly masculine whisper.'My argument suggests that the fundamentalists of our era are even more dangerous than those of the past, for being apparently invisible to us.'<p>There was a pained silence.<br>Prof Zuleikha, taking pity on the boy said,'Come now, my sweet, you can't possibly defend that little idea?'<p>'I believe I can,' said Bunny.'I believe that today's fundamentalists oppress millions of people through the media and the market...' <br>'Blasphemy!' snapped Prof Saraswati'...the fashion industry, for instance,' continued Bunny,'ruthlessly eliminates all those who do not conform to its dress codes.' He looked down at himself, gesturing with the regulation cigarette in his hand.'My hologram has to be updated every week if I want to avoid being lynched!'<p>'But a well-dressed man is an ornament to his society,' said Prof Zuleikha breathily. These young things were so sweet! So charmingly rebellious.'You should consider it your privilege to uphold the standards of this progressive age!'<br>Prof Christine leant forward on her ornamental bone-china crutch:'Consider the dietary restrictions of the past,' she growled. Her subject was Classical Vegetarianism.'Pork for some, beef for others, dog for all except the Chinese...' <br>Bunny took a deep breath.'And today we need special permits from the meat industry if we want carrots with our tiger stew! Today we're forced to eat rattlesnake ratatouille and platypus omelettes because we can no longer share the planet with creatures we don't eat!' He looked defiantly up at the three towering women.'The mullahs of yesterday are the multinational moguls of today!'<p>All three academics snorted.'Sheer guano, sweetie!' said Prof Zuleikha.'Don't they teach you anything? The slogan of the traditional world was "Annihilation is better than cure". Whereas today no-one is killed except by their own non-conformity!'<p>Prof Saraswati reached for her ayurvedic suppositories. As the president of the Enema League, she had led the campaign to bring bowel functions out of the toilet and into the drawing room.'And of course,' she said,'the ancient Hindu strategy of erasing fundamentalism by denying its existence has guaranteed a free and fair society.' Inserting the suppository through a cunningly devised slit in her tartan sarong, she continued:'Look at our University! We're open to all customs, all ages, all diets, all genders, all perversions, all disabilities. Our students are chosen for their mixed ancestry and our courses for their lack of cultural context.'<p>Bunny said,'Isn't that a problem too, M'lady Professor? Isn't there something amiss with the Theory of Mandatory Liberalism? Doesn't it lead to the oppression of those who don't wish to be liberals?''Pah!' exploded Prof Christine.'You're a Closet Terrorist, that's what you are!' she exclaimed.'Behind that obsequious male exterior there's a sneaking, snivelling traditionalist, just dying to run back to the bad old days when Right was Right and Wrong was Wrong!' She poked him with her crutch.'You need to have a little sense twisted into you! The rack in the Psychopathology Lab would do you a world of good. You don't realize how fortunate you are to be living in this permissive era. In the twentieth century you, a man, could never enjoy the sacred privilege of bearing children. Today, through the omniscient grace of biotechnology even the lowly masculine abdomen can be fashioned into a receptacle for the Divine Catheter!' <p>Prof Zuleikha was beginning to squirm. She always did, as the time for her quinturnal copulation approached. She realized she would have no choice but to force herself on Bunny.'Excuse me,' she said, tapping him lightly on the shoulder with her obedience prod.'If you would just come this way...'  He followed her, his eyes glassy, to the couch.<br>The other two professors indulged their separate fixations while watching the weather outside the window turn abruptly tropical.'In his thesis,' said Prof Saraswati presently,'he makes absurd comparisons between the vile caste system of ancient India and the sacred genetic classification of today!' She wiped herself delicately with personal  hygiene tissues hand made from the skins of rare Indonesian lizards. They were believed to be beneficial for several life-times ahead.'He suggests that our chromosomal typing is cruel and unnatural.'<p>Prof Christine gurgled slightly. She had to set her simulator back to neutral before she could  speak.'Well, it's hard to understand any of it,' she said. 'My domestic help was born with the dentition and DNA of a thoroughbred manservant. And yet? For the first fifteen years of his life, his parents steadfastly refused to send him to a Jeevesary, insisting that his IQ suited him to a career in bonsai gardening! Mutants, I tell you! They're all around us...'<br>Prof Zuleikha rejoined them, panting slightly.'Did someone mention mutants?' she asked.'I heard on the Telenet this morning that a community of them had been discovered living in the mangrove swamps on The Fringe.' The Fringe was the name for the boundary of the climate-controlled zone.'I can't understand why they haven't been caught and reconditioned yet. This modern squeamishness about behavior-modulation is ridiculous! Without it, our men would still be uncontrollable brutes.'<p>Bunny joined them, looking subdued.  His willpower was returning to normal and with it, his natural modesty and sense of shame.'Excuse me, M'lady Professors,' he said in his soft voice.'I want to protest this recent event! I had thought that at least in the chambers of my esteemed professors I would be safe from an obedience-prod attack!'Prof Christine trained her brilliant pink eyes on him.'As you are surely aware, young man, Professor Zuleikha belongs to the Holy Order of Hedonists for Peace. It is her sacred duty to perform the reproductory rite five times a day. She certainly finds it more inconvenient than you did just now, but you don't find her complaining or shirking her duties.' The strong sunlight outside was bruising her transparent skin and she turned to move inward.<p><center><img width=393 height=416 src="ni_pix/269_cartoon.gif"></center><p>At this moment, Bunny struck. Whipping out the canister of FemOff he had concealed in his back pocket, he sprayed the room with the concentrated odour of a thousand unbathed, male, American football players just after a game. All three women slipped to thefloor, unconscious. Using the telenet unit on Prof Saraswati's wrist, he entered the code for the Resistance headquarters.'Mission accomplished,' he reported,'the vixens sleep. Begin transmission of reverse-conditioning program...'<br>A volley of enthusiastic clicks and twitters issued from the unit. Too late Bunny remembered that in recognition of !Kung Appreciation Day all communication was to be in that language.  Paralysed with the indecisiveness bred into his sex, he dithered just long enough for the effects of the odour to wear off. He was led away, bravely singing Rugby songs, by a crack team of commando grannies.Restored to dignity, the three professors congratulated themselves upon their narrow escape.<p>'Well, it was all for the best,' said Prof Christine.'He was caught young enough to qualify for a sex change and maternity. In a year he'll just be another balloon-bellied noviciate at the Breeding Central.'<p>'Or I could have him lobotomized and trained as an erotic assistant,' murmured Prof Zuleikha dreamily,'on compassionate grounds of course. He was a menace to himself.'<p>'Who are you talking about?' said Prof Saraswati. She had just finished vaporizing Bunny's thesis.<p>'No-one,' said Prof Christine, as she watched the mid-morning narcissi unfurl their petals in fast forward mode, outside the window.	<p><hr>©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img width=35 height=30 src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="269contents.html"><img width=45 height=60 src="ni_pix/269_coverthumb.gif"> Issue 269</a><hr></body></html>

<b><li>IT Studies in Indiginous Knowledge and Development</b><br>
<i>General editors: Dr David Brokensha, Dr L. Jan Slikkerveer and Dr D. Michael Warren</i><br> 
IT Publications is pleased to announce the launch of this significant series of books, which will highlight the contributions to local, national and international development made by indigenous knowledge systems -- and the tensions which ignoring that knowledge can create. The series will constitute an important and growing contribution to the tools available to both the development and the academic communities in understanding these processes. <p> 

<b><li>Island Technology: Technology for Development in the South Pacific</b><br>
<i>Edited by Tony Marjoram </i><br>
Pacific island countries have united internationally to contest the negative external impacts of Western technology - such as the disposal of poison gas and toxic waste at Johnston Atoll, the transportation of nuclear materials, nuclear testing at Mururoa, and the overwhelming prospect of global warming and a rising sea-level. They have been less attentive, however, regarding the significant yet often more subtle internal effects of technology transfer and dependence. These internal effects encompass the well-identified problems caused by unsustainable fishing, forestry and mining, and also effects rarely noticed by headline writers, namely the widely various costs --and benefits -- of the spread and use (through trade and aid) of new technology in the region. <p>

The contributors focus on the management of technology in the South Pacific and developing island countries and 'island' communities within larger developing countries. <p> 

The twenty-seven contributors to this book are experienced senior researchers, project managers, policy-makers and administrators who are closely involved in the provision of technology for development in the South Pacific. Their analyses and observations span the broad range of issues of concern, and focus on agriculture and forestry, aid and technology, aviation and shipping, banking, communications, development policy and planning, education and training, energy, the environment, fisheries and marine resources, food-processing, gender issues, health, housing, industry, mining, project management, technology choice and transfer, sanitation and water supply. <p>

</H1>
28 November 1995<BR>
<BR>
<B>Britain will continue to be the fifth largest aid donor in the world
next year with an Aid Budget of &#163;2154 million. </B><BR>
<BR>
The Aid Budget is then planned to rise by &#163;47 million to &#163;2201
million in 1997/98, and by a further &#163;69 million to &#163;2270 million
in 1998/99.<BR>
<BR>
In a tight public spending round, the planned allocation for bilateral aid
is likely to be little changed from that set out in last year's departmental
report. British bilateral aid is internationally recognised for its high
quality, and for the substantial share going to the poorest countries in
Africa and Asia, This will continue. <BR>
<BR>
The Aid Budget also funds the UK's contributions to multilateral aid such
as through the World Bank and the European Union. The new plans take into
account lower forecasts for this multilateral aid. Britain will maintain
its effort to ensure that the multilateral organisations to which it contributes
use these resources effectively. <BR>
<BR>
Aid is only one of many ways in which the UK is helping developing countries.
The Government has taken the lead in debt relief initiatives, and the UK
is the third largest source of private capital to the developing world.

2. Figures from 1995/96 to 1997/98 from the Departmental Report are given
in cash terms, to be comparable with those announced in today's Budget.
The expected outturn for 1995/96 differs from the figure previously published
because of in-year transfers and a rollover in respect of underspending
against the 1994-95 Extemal Assistance Vote.<BR>

</font>
<h2>Supporting film-makers in the South</h2>
<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>While TVE co-produces programmes with broadcasters and independent
film-makers from
all over the world, it has a special remit towards film-makers in the South. Over the last 11 years TVE has
worked to promote programming that helps gives a more balanced view of the challenges facing the
developing world - and enables Southern producers and directors to make films that mirror their own
perspective on environmental and development issues. It was this approach which led to the pioneering
concept of Developing Stories which TVE developed with the BBC and the One World Group of
Broadcasters. 

<p>

On co-productions with Northern producers, TVE's policy is always to push for Southern crews and
technicians wherever possible. With grants from Novib in the Netherlands and the European Commission,
TVE has compiled Round the World Crews, a database of film-makers and technicians in developing
countries.</font>

<hr>
<B>Daniel Arap Moi, Yoweri Museveni et Benjamin Mkapa, respectivement
Pr&eacute;sidents du Kenya, d'Ouganda et de Tanzanie, se sont
rencontr&eacute;s &agrave; Arusha &agrave; la mi-mars pour signer
l'accord de constitution d'un secr&eacute;tariat pour le nouveau
syst&egrave;me de coop&eacute;ration en Afrique de l'Est.</B>

<P>
L'ancienne Communaut&eacute; de l'Afrique de l'Est bat de l'aile
depuis les ann&eacute;es 1960 et le gouvernement du Kenya, de
m&ecirc;me que ses op&eacute;rateurs commerciaux, comptent beaucoup
sur sa relance pour donner une nouvelle impulsion &agrave; l'investissement
ext&eacute;rieur, &agrave; l'industrie locale et aux &eacute;changes
entre les trois pays. Les statistiques actuelles du commerce kenyan
avec ses deux voisins d'Afrique de l'Est font appara&icirc;tre
de r&eacute;elles perspectives de coop&eacute;ration dans ce domaine.
En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, les exportations du Kenya vers la Tanzanie
et l'Ouganda sont d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; en progression
(l'Ouganda ayant d'ailleurs supplant&eacute; le Royaume-Uni en
tant que premier march&eacute; d'exportation du Kenya) mais le
niveau des importations du pays en provenance de ses deux voisins
reste peu &eacute;lev&eacute; (voir tableau).
<P>
Beaucoup d'espoirs sont plac&eacute;s dans les possibilit&eacute;s
d'accroissement de la production offertes par un march&eacute;
potentiel de 80 millions de consommateurs, la r&eacute;duction
des droits de douane &eacute;tant appel&eacute;e &agrave; favoriser
les &eacute;changes de produits locaux. <I>Micah Cheserem</I>,
gouverneur de la banque centrale du Kenya, est au nombre des interlocuteurs
du <I>Courrier</I> particuli&egrave;rement enthousiastes &agrave;
propos du nouvel organisme r&eacute;gional. &quot;La coop&eacute;ration
en Afrique de l'Est va devenir r&eacute;alit&eacute; et sera assortie
d'une convertibilit&eacute; des monnaies&quot;, affirme-t-il.
&quot;Elle sera l'une des composantes majeures de l'unit&eacute;
africaine&quot;. M. Cheserem voit le Kenya comme le futur centre
bancaire d'Afrique orientale. Le pays compte d&eacute;j&agrave;
38 banques commerciales, 6 institutions financi&egrave;res de
d&eacute;veloppement, 44 institutions financi&egrave;res non bancaires,
9 bureaux de change et 40 compagnies d'assurance (chiffres d'ao&ucirc;t
1995).
<P>
La coop&eacute;ration entre les anciens membres de la Communaut&eacute;
de l'Afrique de l'Est a &eacute;t&eacute; longtemps entrav&eacute;e
par des divergences politiques. L'entente &eacute;tait effectivement
moins que cordiale entre les ex-leaders de la r&eacute;gion, &agrave;
savoir le pr&eacute;sident socialiste de Tanzanie <I>Julius Nyerere</I>,
le pr&eacute;sident pro-occidental du Kenya <I>Jomo Kenyatta</I>
et le dictateur ougandais <I>Idi Amin</I>.
<P>
L'effondrement d&eacute;finitif de la Communaut&eacute; de l'Afrique
de l'Est en 1977, apr&egrave;s dix ann&eacute;es de survie, a
&eacute;t&eacute; provoqu&eacute; par un d&eacute;saccord sur
la r&eacute;partition entre les diff&eacute;rents pays des gains
tir&eacute;s de l'exploitation de services r&eacute;gionaux communs
tels que la compagnie a&eacute;rienne, les ports et les t&eacute;l&eacute;communications.
En 1994 encore, des divergences politiques entre le Kenya et l'Ouganda
ont bloqu&eacute; les travaux de la Commission tripartite permanente
de l'Afrique de l'Est mise en place pour faciliter la normalisation
des relations entre les trois voisins.
<P>
Le Kenya a accus&eacute; l'Ouganda de donner asile &agrave; des
&quot;&eacute;l&eacute;ments subversifs&quot; hostiles &agrave;
son gouvernement, et plus particuli&egrave;rement au r&eacute;fugi&eacute;
kenyan <I>John Odongo</I>. Le Pr&eacute;sident Moi a r&eacute;clam&eacute;
l'extradition d'Odongo, affirmant qu'il s'agissait d'un rebelle
d&eacute;cid&eacute; &agrave; renverser le gouvernement. L'Ouganda
a refus&eacute; et trouva ensuite une nouvelle r&eacute;sidence
pour son &quot;h&ocirc;te&quot; au Ghana. L'Ouganda s'est plaint,
pour sa part, de ce que le Kenya abritait des dissidents ougandais
de haut vol. Vint ensuite la question du solde de 90 millions
de dollars, dont le Kenya serait redevable &agrave; l'Ouganda
en vertu de l'Accord de 1984 sur le Fonds de compensation de l'Afrique
de l'Est - accord n&eacute;goci&eacute; en 1977 pour r&eacute;gler
toutes les questions financi&egrave;res li&eacute;es &agrave;
la cessation d'activit&eacute; de la Communaut&eacute; de l'Afrique
de l'Est. Enfin, les deux pays ont pris leurs distances au moment
des &eacute;v&egrave;nements du Rwanda, l'Ouganda accusant le
Kenya d'ouvrir ses portes &agrave; certains responsables suppos&eacute;s
du massacre de 1994.
<P>
La poign&eacute;e de main symbolique - et fortement m&eacute;diatis&eacute;e
- entre les pr&eacute;sidents Moi et Museveni, intervenue &agrave;
la fin du mois de janvier dernier, laisse supposer que les deux
leaders ont enterr&eacute; la hache de guerre. Un secr&eacute;taire
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral pour la nouvelle EAC (East Africa Cooperation),
dont la nomination aurait d&ucirc; &ecirc;tre effectu&eacute;e
par le Kenya il y a un an, a finalement &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;sign&eacute;
&agrave; la mi-mars. Il s'agit de <I>Francis Muthura</I>, ancien
ambassadeur du Kenya aupr&egrave;s des Nations Unies &agrave;
New York. Il ne lui sera certainement pas facile de concr&eacute;tiser
les objectifs d&eacute;finis dans le nouvel accord. Mais les perspectives
d'une coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale constructive, et les
avantages qu'elle devrait engendrer, sont plus prometteurs que
jamais.

<HR>
<I>L'utilisation de l'aide internationale ne s'inscrit pas syst&egrave;matiquement
dans un v&eacute;ritable sch&eacute;ma de d&eacute;veloppement.
Apr&egrave;s l'&eacute;chec des politiques d'aide fond&eacute;e
sur la modernisation des infrastructures, la palette des projets
soutenus par la Coop&eacute;ration internationale s'est excessivement
&eacute;parpill&eacute;e. En cons&eacute;quence, les programmes
financ&eacute;s ne sont pas toujours judicieusement choisis et
n'am&eacute;liorent pas la s&eacute;curit&eacute; des populations.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Depuis pr&egrave;s de quarante ans, l'utilisation de l'aide publique
au d&eacute;veloppement (APD) s'est beaucoup diversifi&eacute;e
pour tenir compte de l'&eacute;volution des besoins des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
En chemin, elle a peu &agrave; peu perdu de sa coh&eacute;rence
et s'est excessivement &eacute;parpill&eacute;e.
<P>
La diversification des projets s'est tout d'abord inscrite dans
une logique de d&eacute;veloppement. A la fin des ann&eacute;es
1960, les responsables des programmes d'aide se sont avis&eacute;s
qu'il ne suffisait pas de r&eacute;aliser d'ambitieux ouvrages
d'infrastructure et de moderniser l'appareil productif. Ils ont
&eacute;largi leurs priorit&eacute;s au d&eacute;veloppement rural,
aux industries de substitution aux importations, &agrave; la sant&eacute;
et &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation. Les chocs p&eacute;troliers, la
faible croissance des pays du Nord, la chute des recettes d'exportation
des pays en d&eacute;veloppement et la crise de la dette ont ensuite
contraint &agrave; employer une part croissante de l'APD pour
restaurer les &eacute;quilibres macro-&eacute;conomiques, proc&eacute;der
&agrave; des r&eacute;formes structurelles trop longtemps diff&eacute;r&eacute;es
et corriger les cons&eacute;quences sociales de l'ajustement.
Plus r&eacute;cemment, l'aide d'urgence &agrave; caract&egrave;re
humanitaire s'est &eacute;galement g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;e.
<P>
<H3>L'&eacute;parpillement des projets</H3>
<P>
En Afrique sub-saharienne, l'&eacute;volution des concours de
la Banque internationale pour la reconstruction et le d&eacute;veloppement
et de l'Association internationale pour le d&eacute;veloppement
illustre la profondeur des changements. Le secteur agricole attire
13,5 % de l'APD en moyenne sur la p&eacute;riode 1991-1995 contre
22,2 % en 1986-1990, l'industrie 2,4 contre 5,3 %, les infrastructures
21,7 contre 27,2 %. En revanche, la part de la sant&eacute; et
de l'&eacute;ducation est pass&eacute;e de 9 &agrave; 18 %, la
restructuration du secteur public et l'assainissement du syst&egrave;me
financier absorbent 34 % de l'aide contre 29 % auparavant.
<P>
La composition de l'aide a &eacute;galement suivi les changements
de perspective des r&eacute;gions en d&eacute;veloppement. L'APD
comprend tous les concours aux pays en d&eacute;veloppement (PED)
et aux pays en transition d'Europe centrale et orientale consentis
sous forme de dons ou de pr&ecirc;ts dont l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment-dont
par rapport aux conditions du march&eacute; repr&eacute;sente
au moins 25 % (du fait de la bonification des taux, de l'allongement
des dur&eacute;es ou des diff&eacute;r&eacute;s d'amortissement).
Elle se mesure en versements effectu&eacute;s ou en promesses
d'engagement. Elle peut &ecirc;tre &eacute;valu&eacute;e en flux
bruts ou en flux nets, apr&egrave;s remboursement des &eacute;ch&eacute;ances
de pr&ecirc;ts. Elle peut inclure ou non l'assistance technique.
Enfin, en ce qui concerne l'aide multilat&eacute;rale, on peut
mesurer les apports des pays donateurs aux organismes multilat&eacute;raux
ou les versements de ces organismes aux PED b&eacute;nficiaires.
<P>
Les pays du tiers monde n'ont pas &eacute;volu&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on
uniforme et les modalit&eacute;s de l'aide comme les versements
ont &eacute;volu&eacute; en fonction de la situation &eacute;conomique
de chacun. C'est ainsi que globalement la part des dons a progress&eacute;
(77 % du total en 1994), surtout pour les pays les moins avanc&eacute;s
(99 % de dons) et que l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment-don global est sup&eacute;rieur
&agrave; 90 %. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; leur dynamisme &eacute;conomique,
les pays d'Asie ont d&eacute;sormais moins besoin de l'aide ext&eacute;rieure.
Ils ne re&ccedil;oivent plus que 26 % de l'APD, contre 37 % en
1983. Ces ressources ne constituent d'ailleurs qu'une tr&egrave;s
faible part de leur produit int&eacute;rieur brut (Pib), soit
0,7 %. La part des pays latino-am&eacute;ricains a stagn&eacute;
(environ 12 % du total de l'APD, soit 1,1 % de leur Pib), celle
des pays d'Europe du Sud, d'Afrique du Nord et du Moyen-Orient
&eacute;galement (20 %). Les pays d'Afrique sub-saharienne, en
revanche, repr&eacute;sentent 37 % de l'APD contre 29 % en 1983.
L'aide internationale constitue ainsi 11 % de leur Pib ou 16 %
en flux bruts. On a beaucoup craint la concurrence des pays d'Europe
centrale et orientale en pleine transition &eacute;conomique et
sociale, mais ces appr&eacute;hensions &eacute;taient exag&eacute;r&eacute;es.
Depuis 1991, ils ne re&ccedil;oivent pas plus de 7,5 milliards
de dollars, soit 0,04 % du Pib des donateurs.
<P>
L'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide se heurte &agrave; plusieurs obstacles.
Longtemps, l'assistance technique a pu appara&icirc;tre mal int&eacute;gr&eacute;e
dans les structures administratives locales, les donateurs nouant
directement des relations avec les services sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s
du pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire. L'administration ne se sent
alors ni responsable des projets, ni impliqu&eacute;e dans la
politique de d&eacute;veloppement. D'autre part, les crit&egrave;res
de performance qui accompagnent les programmes d'ajustement structurel
n'ont pas non plus encourag&eacute; les autorit&eacute;s locales
&agrave; assumer leurs responsabilit&eacute;s. Ces crit&egrave;res
(financiers, institutionnels, sociaux, environnementaux) ne sont
pas contestables en eux-m&ecirc;mes, mais comme le pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
n'est pas responsable de leur choix, il ne les reprend pas &agrave;
son compte. Cette grille d'&eacute;valuation introduit en outre
un paradoxe, car elle implique que l'&Eacute;tat intervienne de
fa&ccedil;on importante au moment o&ugrave; les r&eacute;formes
structurelles exigent d'all&eacute;ger l'appareil administratif.
Enfin, les crit&egrave;res de r&eacute;sultat s'inscrivent le
plus souvent dans des programmes de court terme (trois ans). Or,
il est irr&eacute;aliste de supposer qu'on puisse en aussi peu
de temps proc&eacute;der &agrave; des changements en profondeur.
Sans perspective &agrave; long terme, comment les politiques de
d&eacute;veloppement peuvent-elles &ecirc;tre efficaces ?
<P>
La communaut&eacute; internationale a ainsi longtemps juxtapos&eacute;
les projets de d&eacute;veloppement sans tenir compte de l'environnement
macro-&eacute;conomique ou international. Elle n'a pas toujours
su se concentrer suffisamment sur le d&eacute;veloppement, qui
passe par une politique d'ensemble et non par des projets compartiment&eacute;s.
L'APD, enfin, a souffert de n'&ecirc;tre qu'une &#171;aide&#187;
et non un v&eacute;ritable partenariat entre donateurs et b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
Mais devant l'impossibilit&eacute; de concr&eacute;tiser le nouvel
ordre &eacute;conomique international imagin&eacute; au cours
des ann&eacute;es 1970, les pays donateurs ont in&eacute;vitablement
r&eacute;pondu &agrave; des consid&eacute;rations g&eacute;ostrat&eacute;giques
et &agrave; des imp&eacute;ratifs de solidarit&eacute;. Il s'agit
aujourd'hui de redonner sa coh&eacute;rence au projet de coop&eacute;ration
internationale, autour d'un appui concert&eacute;, strat&eacute;gique,
aux efforts des PED les plus d&eacute;munis pour renouer avec
le d&eacute;veloppement et la croissance et lutter contre la marginalisation,
comme aux politiques engag&eacute;es par les plus dynamiques pour
s'int&eacute;grer &agrave; l'&eacute;conomie mondiale, qui doivent
&ecirc;tre acccompagn&eacute;es. La question du d&eacute;veloppement
ne concerne pas que les peuples du Sud. La d&eacute;gradation
de l'environnement, la croissance d&eacute;mographique, l'explosion
urbaine, l'imp&eacute;ratif de s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire
et toutes les situations de d&eacute;tresse qui nourrissent les
migrations internationales sont des probl&egrave;mes mondiaux
qui justifient l'effort de coop&eacute;ration internationale.
Au-del&agrave; des enjeux g&eacute;opolitiques et de la compassion,
la poursuite des politiques d'aide repose aussi, fondamentalement,
sur un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t mutuel qu'il faut remettre au premier
plan.

At the end of the twentieth century, women are still fighting for the most basic of rights - control over their own bodies.

Children have been exposed to atrocities to a degree never been seen before.<p><ul><li>300,000 children were killed, often in brutal ways.  In some of the largest mass graves up to 45% of the victims were children;<li>Over 95,000 children, 40,000 in Rwanda, lost their parents or were seperated from them.<li>42% lost both parents.<li>56% witnessed a family memeber being killed.<li>75% wittnessed other people being killed.<li>47% saw children killing other children.<li>64% witnessed massacres.<li>20% witnessed rape and sexual assualt.<li>Many children are able to name more than 20 persons close to them who are dead.</ul>In August 1994, UNICEF's child psychologists visited the sites of massacres and talked to the children in the area, producing the first assessments of the traumatic effects of war on children.<p>The Trauma Recovery Programme (TRP), within the Children in Especially Difficult Circumstances Section (CEDC), was established to address the immediate and long-term psychosocial needs of war-affected children and their families.  As part of the Programme UNICEF will train 12 Trauma Advisors, one for each prefecture, in trauma alleviation methods.  These advisors will then pass on their knowledge to teachers, social workers, health care providors and religious leaders.  So far, The TRP has trained a total of 1,843 social agents in basic issues of trauma identification was broadcasted and over 1,500 Trauma First Aid messages to various social agents throughout Rwanda have been disseminated.<p>The TRP has conducted and analyzed data from a pilot survey completed in December 1994 on levels of trauma ammong children in centres and family settings.  Amongst the findings was the fact that 62% of those interviewed felt they had no future and did not expect to live long.<p>A set of "Guidelines for Psychological Trauma Healing" was produced by the Ministry of Social Rehabilitation in collaboration with UNICEF and seven NGO's.  The Government of Rwanda has acknowledged the importance of psychosocial intervension with traumatized children as one of its priorities.<p>A national Child Recovery Centre will be opened in April 1995 in Kigali to become a focal point for training, documentation and research, with an outpatient clinic for severely traumatized children/families.<hr>©Copyright: UNICEF 1995<hr><a href="index.html" target="_parent"><img src="unicef_pix/unicef_logo2.gif">UNICEF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

Today, UNICEF is witnessing numerous family reunifications.  The encouraging results of the tracing and family reunification programme show that UNICEF and its partners are on a very promising path.</i><hr>Up to 8,980 have already been reunified with their families: 5,043 in Rwanda; 3,085 in Goma, 540 in Bukavu, 300 in Ngara and 12 in Uvira.  UNICEF, together with ICRC, has registered and photographed 12,600 children in Goma.  The photographing of unaccompanied children - an important aid in the re-unification process - has begun inside Rwanda, and is continuing in other refugee locations.<p>UNICEF Goma, in cooperation with its NGO partners, is assisting foster families as part of a larger of de-institutionalization and prevention of child abandonment.<p>While tracing continues, children receive temporary care in centres and foster families.<p>To date, about 26,070 children inside and outside Rwanda are living in 117 centres.  In Rwanda, 12% of the children living in camps are under 5 years old - About 50% of the centres are run by Rwandese.<p>It is estimated that 67,410 (limited statistics/Caritas/FHI/UNICEF) children have already been taken in by foster families inside and outside the country.<hr>©Copyright: UNICEF May 1995<hr><a href="index.html" target="_parent"><img src="unicef_pix/unicef_logo2.gif">UNICEF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

UNICEF will ensure, in cooperation with the Office of the High Commisioner for Human Rights (CHR), the respect of the rights of all imprisoned children and women with particular attention given to children accused of genocide.</i><hr>As of mid-April, 1,019 minors were detained in some of the thirteen major prisons and over 145 detention centres in Rwanda.  Children as young as 5 years of age have been accused of criminal  acts.  Other young children have not been accused themselves, but are accompanying a charged parent.<p>UNICEF, ICRC, and HCHR staff make regular visits to the Kigali prison, and have visited other prisons and detension centres around the country.<p>UNICEF will provide support costs for 10 Rwandan lawyers over the next year, who will focus on children' cases.<p>With the support of the HCHR, all minors and women in Kigali prison have been interviewed and photographed and their dossiers are being compiled.<p>UNICEF has delivered food stuff, mattrasses and children's clothes to the children in prison.<p>A juvenile detention centre is presently being refurbished at Gitagata, 42km South of Kigali.  It is expected that the first group of 200 children under 15 years of age will be transfered there by the end of April.<hr>©Copyright: UNICEF.

During the emergency phase, UNICEF, together with UNESCO, initiated a Teacher Emergency Package (TEP) designed to start up from scratch the educational system in the country.</i><hr>A large number of children and teachers were the victims of the massacres.  School buildings were destroyed and looted.<p>The TEP or 'school-in-a-box' provides a quick response, self-contained mobile classroom, with one teacher can set up anywhere.  So far, 7000 TEPs have been distributed which cover the needs of 560,000 children.  More than 11,500 teachers have been trained into the TEP methodology.<p>Each school-in-a-box costs only US $170 and meets the needs of 80 students in two shifts, working out at a cost of just over two dollars per pupil.<p>The TEP is conceived as a bridge between the present situation and one where a regular curriculum can be imposed.  Together with the Ministries of Primary and Secondary Education and of Higher Education, UNICEF is working on the development of a school curriculum.<p>On 20 March 1995, 65,000 primary school students took an exam to graduate to secondary school.  UNICEF provided fuel and transport for the exam inspectors and $25,000 worth of school supplies.<p>In 1995, UNICEF and UNESCO are planning to rehabilitate 100 schools outside of Kigali.<p>According to UNICEF, 70% of the teachers in the primary cycle are either inexperienced or unqualified.  Therefore, a special emphasis will be given to teacher training.  School supplies and textbooks are also needed, especially to replenish TEPs.<p>UNICEF and UNESCO have begun the distribution of 400 TEPs to refugee camps in Eastern Zaire and Tanzania.  The training of teachers is also underway.<p>TEPs will be distributed in Kigali prison for detained children (in co-ordination with the Commission for Human Rights and ICRC).<p>An education for peace and reconciliation programme will be implemented throughout the year 1995.<hr>©Copyright  UNICEF.

The number of people infected by the AIDS virus has risen considerably in the aftermath of the war.  the high incidence of rape, promiscuity in refugee and displaced camps, and the loss of social values and inhibitions explains this rising tendancy.  For 1995, UNICEF will support a programme of AIDS prevention and awareness for children and adolescents.</i><hr>The prevalence of AIDS virus cases in Rwanda before the war - 91 cases per 100,000 persons was one of the highest in the world.<p>The incidence of AIDS has increased dramatically in urban areas: 30% of the total number of pregnant women have tested HIV-positive during neo-natal examinations.<p>Generally speaking, 15 to 19 year-old girls in urban areas are more affected than boys of the same age.  The highest incidence of AIDS victims is among non-educated urban dwellers.<p>The number of orphans who have lost their parents due to AIDS - 13,000 in Kigali alone - is worrying.  UNICEF will support family-like homes headed by a primary care-giver (mother) responsible for at least 10 AIDS orphans.  These homes will be run by NGOs.<p>In comparison to the atrocities of war, the risk of AIDS appears of secondary concern to the population as a whole.<p>In the AIDS awareness programme, budgeted at nearly 1 million USD for 1995, UNICEF will train a cadre of 5,000 adolescents aged 15-19 according to the 'child-to-child' teaching method.  In schools, a special programme, "survival reflex", will be initiated to teach basic preventive approaches for younger children from 5 to 14 years of age.<hr>©Copyright:  UNICEF.

The fragility of the country continues to increase the vulnerability of the population, particularly women and children.  In 1995, UNICEF and its many counterparts are committed to rehabilitating the health system.</i><hr>The challenge to UNICEF and its partners is not to create, but to re-establish, a primary health care system which, before April 1994, was well developed.<p>The task is not simple: most centres and dispensaries have been looted if not destroyed and there is a shortage of trained medical professionals.  Many medical doctors and nurses have been killed, disappeared or have fled to neighbouring countries, leaving only 20% of the prewar health centre positions filled by qualified staff.<p>UNICEF has spent nearly 14 million dollars in the emergency phase of 1994 to meet immediate needs.<p>UNICEF is rehabilitating some 100 health centres throughout the country.  The cold chain store in Kigali has been installed and is distributing vaccines and other medical equipment throughout the country.  The central pharmacy in Kigali has been repaired and drug distribution began in September 1994.<p>Malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory diseases represent the principle causes of mortality.  The overcrowded conditions in the camps and the lack of sanitation have considerably increased the morbidity rates.  Epidemic diseases like Cholera, bacillary dysentary and meningitis have caused the deaths of thousands of children.<p>In 1995, UNICEF is undertaking a sensitization and prevention campaign by disseminating health messages to combat illnesses, such as malaria, water borne and diarrhoeal diseases.<p>UNICEF has increased the immunization rate to 70%.<p>UNICEF supports the Ministry of Health in its efforts to increase the quality of health services.  This is being done by intensive training in EPI, control of diarrhoeal diseases (CDD), as well as acute respiratory infections (ARI).  UNICEF is also training health workers in Mother and Child Health Care (MCH) and Health Information Systems.<hr>©Copyright:  UNICEF.

<html><head><title>CHILDREN FIRST - WATER AND SANITATION</title><!!keys:UNICEF+children+Rwanda+refugees ></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#333366" vlink="#3399ff" text="#000000"><img src="unicef_pix/unicef_logo.gif"><hr><h3>WATER AND SANITATION - FOR A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE</h3><i>The much publicised health crisis in Goma underscored the need for preparedness and a rapid response in the water and sanitation sector.</i><hr>The uncertain times that prevailed during Rwanda's war resulted in massacres, shooting, vandalism, looting and the abandonment of posts by many employees.  This brought about a total disruption of most public services, including electricity and water supply.<p>UNICEF was assigned as the lead agency responsible for water and sanitation in the Rwanda Emergency Operation.  Its intervensions in this sector, which cost some $11.4 million in 1994, have had a significant impact on the quality of life and hygiene of the population in local communities and refugee camps.  UNICEF has contrinuted to the reduction of water and hygiene-related diseases, prevented further epidemics, and promoted stability and normal life which has attracted some refugees to return to their home communes.<p>Since August 1994, 95% of the pre-war urban water supply facilities and 70% of the pre-war rural water supply infrastructure have been substantially restored.  In addition, sanitation coverage to the population has now reached about 80% of the pre-war level; 85% of the population of Kigali now has access to potable water every day or on alternate days.  UNICEF has supplied chemicals to 13 water treatment plants nationwide and diesel for 16 generators in the water pumping stations in Kigali.  UNICEF has also spearheaded the training of local water personnel and the promotion of hygiene education.<p>UNICEF now considers the restoration of the National Electricity Grid as its number one priority.  The enormous costs associated with the operation and maintenance of diesel generating units for treatment plants and pumping installations, cannot be sustained and should be eliminated as soon as possible.  To date, 7 out of 11 towns have been reconnected to the national grid.  At the beginning of March 1995, UNICEF procured US$ 500,000 of materials for Electrogaz for the further rehabilitation of the national electricity grid.<p>UNICEF provides water and sanitation services to refugee camps, internally displaced persons camps, and unaccompanied children centres in Goma and Bukavu and dug 30 deep borehole wells in Ngara, Tanzania, for some 300,000 refugees.  UNICEF has installed 5 mobile water treatment plants, rehabilitated 17 gravity flow pipelines, protected four springs, installed 160 Oxfam tanks and water bladders, reconstructed some 7km of water pipelines.  Eleven UNICEF water tankers distribute an estimated 200 cubic metres of water per day in various parts of the country.<p>Throughour 1995, ina ddition to completing the full rehabilitation of pre-war facilities, UNICEF's main objectives in the water and sanitation sector will be:<ul><li>Capacity building for policy development at the central government level.<p><li>Strengthening capacity for service delivery.<p><li>Community capacity building for water, sanitation and hygiene.</ul>A major constraint to the achievement of the above objectives is the absence of adequately trained personnel at government and community levels.  Consequently, there is a need  to train new staff to replace lost skilled manpower.  This will take time and may slow down activities.  The government's limited vehicle fleet, and the lack of adequate office equipment should help to alleviate these problems to some degree.<p>UNICEF's Rwanda appeal for its 1995 Water and Sanitation programme is $13.1 Million.  This includes provisions for cross border intervensions in refugee camps in Goma, Bukavu and Ngara.<hr>©Copyright:  UNICEF.

You may remember that it took me 30 years to write this story. Thirty long years, I might add, during which time it was one of the few things in the world which I could rely upon. It was a tangible constant, unlike other things I might mention, such as wives, families and children; a series of unfortunate events, none of which had any direct bearing on this story. The only thing with which this matter could be compared is that fascination which we call love, for it was such an obsession.<p>

One might consider 30 years to be a little long to write something as simple as a story. It is a long time; a lifetime in your case. Why did I do it? What kept me at it ? The long sleepless nights, the frustrations, the crumpled sheets of paper, not to mention the eternal domestic conflicts incurred by such a hopeless pursuit? The stories became my life, it is as simple as that and my life became the stories. Everything else fell outside the limits of that ring of light. And who could not say that he did not regret having been blind?<p>
<center></center><p>

You ask me, so I will tell you: the world fell apart long before you were born. The image which had been so preserved for, well for as long as anyone could remember, was suddenly shattered. Before the world as we know it now came into being, there was another world; very similar in many ways, but on the whole quite different. Of course it looked much the same as it does now; a blue ball bobbing along in that inky black ocean of space. They even sent some poor fools out there to take a photograph, just to prove the fact; which goes to show just how primitive they were in those days. It is still the same floating ball, perhaps not quite as blue, a little more grey maybe, like everything else.<p>




A lonely, heart-broken place was the world into which you squeezed; plagued by suffering and war of every description. Time began to accelerate and as it did so, so it seemed that the dream to whose task humans had set themselves began to metamorphose, to change shape. It stretched and it bent, this way and that, like a star folding in on itself, like a box, or one of those black holes which sucks in all of its own light. The world suffered a series of catastrophes, some of them freaks of nature, but the majority of them were human-made. People began to question the role of humans in the scheme of things and there was a resurgence of shallow religious soul-searching.<p>

By this time of course I was completely dedicated to what was to become this story - or stories, for in truth it was like a finely woven tapestry - although I was not aware of it at the time. I embarked on a series of projects, each one completely absorbing in its own right, and each one but a tiny step along the way, although it was not until later that I was able to see this.<p>

We had entered the age of the Information Revolution, as it was called. It was no different from any of those other infamous events that dot the charts of history. Yes, people cheered and waved their banners; metaphorically speaking of course, slogans bounced around the globe like decapitated heads in sixteenth-century Paris. <p>

Things happened very quickly. The world was divided, no longer by borderlines that ran along the earth, but by
invisible strata that filled the air like
clouds which you could not quite grasp. The transglobal and the local became
interchangeable. Everyone was either on the move, or thinking about it. There was no longer any difference between what happened right in front of you and what happened on the other side of the world. A similar thing happened to reality - people could no longer tell the difference between inter-space and the real world; which of them after all was real? Philosophy could not help us and neither could religion.<p>

I see that I am already in danger of becoming side-tracked. Of course everything was relative. Those parts of the world which were excluded from this new exchange simply vanished. That is to say nothing was ever heard from them. No-one knew whether people still lived there anymore and thus they ceased to exist. Of course one aspect of this revolution was the dissolution of countries as such. They had been crumbling for a long time and with the instability and general decay of the less wealthy regions of the world, it seemed wiser to form new conglomerate blocs. Like everything of course, this never worked out the way it was planned, but was rather an absurd parody. No sooner were they formed and secure than they began to eat away at themselves from within.<p>

No matter; the world had grown much smaller, and it was to continue to do so. The poor and the rich lived side by side, if not on top of one another. New feudal states were formed around individuals, corporations and mercantile banks. They formed their own subcultures within the main cultural sphere. Where wealth resided they constructed the equivalent of kingdoms; huge shining towers of glass and steel. These contained everything necessary for the existence of the inhabitants. Because of the difficulties of travel, people stayed at home, where it was safe and comfortable and they really had no need of anything. It was this isolation which brought about the Information Revolution itself, which had actually happened some decades before, only no-one had actually noticed. The second time around it was no longer radical, but it was far more powerful, because it was necessary.<p>

They constructed a series of invisible nets which they threw around the world. They tore down the stars and threw up hundreds of gleaming alloy orbs to hold the threads together. People spoke to one another across thousands of miles of empty space. They could not open a window, but they could make babies with someone on the other side of the world without leaving their room. This net grew of course, something like a giant tuber or beanshoot maybe, growing thicker and stronger as it circled the planet. And inside this was concealed all the radiance and brilliance of humankind; the achievements of centuries.<p>

In the old days they used to fight over land, but land had by now been deemed worthless. A series of hypothetical lands appeared and were subsequently the focus of heated frenzy. For a time, all that counted was knowledge about these lands; worlds within worlds and since no-one dared to go out and find these places, no-one could really prove whether they existed or not. Information was being shovelled back and forth like iron ore or stone. It clogged up the mind the way lead fumes used to, like coal dust in the lungs.<p>

It was out of this that our group was formed. We were radical in those days, our motto was 'Communication, not information!'. We got together to adopt a country. This was the way of things then. Since the collapse of the UN in a scandal whereby countries had been sold off to a chain of mafia-like charity organizations there was nothing to stop anyone wishing to involve themselves this way. This was not really so bad. Private investment had been what governments had been doing anyway. It cleared the air. Outside the places where wealth resided the world had also splintered into tribes and camps of the most primitive and bizarre form. There were countries devoted to the worship of whales; different forms of superstition; political ideologies; sexual
orientations of every kind; automobiles; cosmologies; cutlery; in fact anything one could think of. Somewhere inside all this confusion there was humanity and it was this to which we were determined to devote ourselves. <p>

By now some of the problems I was up against might be clear: no matter how fast I worked, it seemed to be slipping out of my hands at every turn. We decided to withdraw, to return to a timescale measured by the rise and fall of the sun. It sounds
simple-minded, and perhaps it was, but it was all we could do.<p>

Then came the Last Great Plague, a virus that raged through the electronic archives eating up everything it could find. An epidemic of such proportions that nothing could withstand it. Everything was lost; the entire sum total of human existence was gone forever. Books had long since been recycled into toilet paper and what have you. Writers and intellectuals had been siphoned out to make way for technologists whose knowledge was worthless without the archives to activate them. We were left with nothing.
The great cities of past civilization were closed to us. The language which they used was a hybrid form so that although we knew the foundation upon which it was based, we could not decipher the layers of slang and new words. We were alone, and from this came the stories.<p>

The future was no longer somewhere in the far off distance, but here and now. Where the stories came from, nobody really knew, but they began to grow, building upon one another naturally and of their own accord. They were our story, collectively, alone. They helped to pass the long starlit evenings; stars for which we only had the ancient names. Each story was a guide, a pointer toward something that we called ourselves. The history of the world was to begin again.<p>

I have no idea where you are or whether you will ever find this, or even whether you will be able to decipher this message; but know that I have not given up, that I am still working, and one of these days this work will be done and there will no longer be any need to wince at the word memory: for we will have regained our ability to remember.	<p>

<tr><td width=200></td>



<td width=400>The Russian intelligentsia, dispirited, shorn of influence and broke, had a colloquium in the <i>Literaturnaya gazeta</i> in February on its relationship with power. Led off by the greatest of the surviving sixties bards, Bulat Okudzhava - who said that Yeltsin had turned away from a group which had been his staunchest supporters when he was elected five years ago, and now 'scorned' it because he and his cronies could not bear criticism - it was in the main a melancholy series of reflections. Most agreed with Okudzhava: lamented the loss of a leader who had held out a promise of renewal: those who remained reluctantly loyal - and none were robust about being so - fell back on a recognition that speech was now free and that the Communists would be worse. There collective posture was well summed up by the writer Andrei Bitov: the mark of an intellectual, he said, was to stand for certain moral and intellectual values, and to<i> have nothing to do with power.</i><p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>



Those members of the intelligentsia who had expected more and tried to assist Yeltsin achieve it have usually had their fingers burned: some have resigned, some were sacked, a few cling on for the usual reason that to leave would hand their place to someone worse. The most famous defector was the former prisoner of conscience Sergei Kovalev<i> (see page 54),</i> who served as Yeltsin's Human Rights Ombudsman, protested loudly and with great courage against the war in Chechnya (he spent many weeks under bombardment in Grozny, the Chechen capital) and finally resigned from the last of his official posts earlier this year. In his resignation letter of 24 January 1996, a little literary and polemical masterpiece, he laments that Yeltsin was unable to make the break from being a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to become...a human being.<p>



It was a fine rhetorical flourish, but it was wrong. Yeltsin's record is, whatever else, that of an all-too-human being: or, as Solzhenitsyn said of him well, a man 'almost too Russian'. Kovalev's formulation puts him out of the reach of human moral choice: the problem for the Russian intelligentsia, and for all the Russians who will choose a president on 16 June, is that they must make precisely such a choice.<p>



The charge sheet against Yeltsin is an easy one to fill. In five years, he has described a tragic arc from vibrant defender of democracy to a closeted, narrowed man, suspicious of previous allies, enclosed by a circle almost none of whom have any links with the democrats and liberals of the late eighties and early nineties.<p>



Chechnya leads the charges. It is not clear why he did not move against the rebellious, criminalised state much more quickly after it declared de facto independence at the end of 1991: allegations that senior officials and generals profited from its arms and drug trading rings may have a purchase on the decision. But when, in late 1994, after the failure of semi-clandestine efforts by the federal counter-intelligence agency to overthrow the regime of General Dzhokar Dudayev in concert with the groups of Chechens opposed to him, he ordered a full-scale military invasion of the republic, it is clear that the decision was the worst of his career - whether as a Communist or an anti-Communist. It has claimed some 50,000 lives, destroyed Grozny and other towns and villages in the republic, created hundreds of thousands of refugees, shattered the regional economy - and did not achieve its objective of restoring effective government, nor of defeating Dudayev, and certainly not of ensuring a stable peace.<p>



In the course of the attempt, he has demonstrated the weakness of Russian arms - a weakness which might have been expected, given the shocks to which the military have been subjected in the past decade, but which nonetheless was itself shocking to witness. A general staff openly riven and split on participation in the war, insubordinate officers at all levels, a soldiery sullen, desperate to avoid the draft and so poorly fed and provisioned that at times they could not mount simple missions. At times, it seemed as if their largest activity was selling their weapons to those with whom they were locked in combat.<p>



Ironically, this very demonstration of weakness and incompetence in both the military and in the interior ministry troops may - surely, must - stimulate a party of reform within the general staff to bring about structural changes in a force diminished but largely unreconstructed since Soviet times. Yet even if that happens, it has been a hideous price to pay - the more so since the undoubted threat to the Russian state and to many of its citizens in and out of Chechnya could have been addressed (but was not) by a variety of measures short of war.<p>



That the refusal to face the Caucasian tangle before the violence unleashed in December 1994 should be plausibly ascribed to corruption at the highest levels is an indication of how far the rottenness in the state has gone. Corruption, endemic in Soviet times, is a rule of official and political life in post-Soviet: and though it is impossible to imagine that the transition from command economy to some form of market could fail to be accompanied by a splurge of criminality, it is also true that the Yeltsin circle has set a bad example and never acted as a pole of relative probity. Instead, the President himself has granted a very large tax and other concessions to make his friends rich, has spread state largesse about with a free hand and has tolerated a level of corruption around him which dwarfs anything else in the world. In the past two years in particular, Yeltsin has acquiesced in the grabbing of corporations worth billions of dollars, - including Gasprom, the biggest enterprise in the world - by people who are simply unknown.<p>



He has adopted great swathes of his nationalist - and now his Communist - opponents' programmes: now celebrating what would be an economically disastrous union with Belarus, then decreeing that the red flag - with a star, but shorn of the hammer and sickle - should again be recognised as a state banner of Russia. Once a campaigner against the power and omnipresence of the KGB, he has re-created many of the features of a security state: and his closest guide, protector and friend is General Korzhakov, the former KGB officer who followed into (and back from) the wilderness in 1987, and who now constitutes a lowering, suspicious presence at every occasion. In the presidential campaign so far he has shown no compunction in mobilising television behind his campaign - silencing criticism, firing his one time friend Oleg Poptsov from the chairmanship of Russian TV because of the latter's critical spirit (see page 65).<p>



It is, as Kovalev also said in his resignation letter, something of a tragedy. For many, it has become wholly clear that Boris Yeltsin never wished to achieve power in order to build democracy, but merely wished to destroy the Soviet system to achieve power. It seems clear enough that the only possible reason to vote for him is, indeed, that Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, is likely to be worse - though even that is debated.<p>



Yet a case can be made in Yeltsin in more positive terms. For he can still be seen as a man who has the remnants of a vision of a freer Russia in him, and who would still define his life's work as seeking to achieve it. It is a case which has worn threadbare, and it is impossible to tell if it will stand up to the exigencies of a second term, were he to win one in June. But it should be made.<p>



The country has the institutions of a law governed state. The constitution (of December 1993) may have been adopted through large-scale falsification: written in the aftermath of the shelling of the Russian parliament, it is heavily pro-presidential, giving Russia's fledgling parties little formal scope for development. The constitutional court was unconstitutionally abolished by the president in the aftermath of the October 1993 events, and was slow to be recreated (though it now is): it has so far not played a very active role in adjudicating abuses.<p>



But the institutions are there, and they have tended to strengthen themselves. The Duma (lower house) and Federation Council (upper house) have reflected the new majorities produced by the December elections: they have the power of influence, of legislative initiative and of denial of agreement to the budget and other legislation: and though the presidential administration is swollen and powerful, it has not mounted a challenge. The two and a half years since the shelling of the White house has not been a time of steadily tightening authoritarianism, as many thought it would be at the time: instead, it has been a time of contradictions, of retreats here and advances there.<p>



Advances, most of all, in the economy - though few which have benefited the mass of people. After nearly four years of plans which part worked then wholly failed, a series of policies were adopted at the beginning of 1995, backed by the International Monetary Fund, which have seen inflation brought down to 25-30 per cent on an annual basis, (it was at that level each month two years ago), the budget deficit lowered to six per cent and the rouble strengthening against the hard currencies. Russia has instituted a unique form of 'slow shock therapy' - the result of unremitting struggle between liberal and conservative politicians and economists, which the liberals seem slowly to be winning.<p>



The slowness has been bad for the people, who have had to endure the effects of the transition much longer than those in other former Communist states. The fall in living standards for the majority, the fall in production and the constant interruptions to services have produced an insecure and harried population, whose male death rate - an astonishing average of 57 - reflects the arduousness of the times. Russia - and the other post-Soviet states - could not escape a hard landing - so distorted was its economy, so much in thrall to military production, so overstaffed and uncompetitive. The only saving grace was to make the shock sharp - a strategy Yeltsin backed, but then backed away from when political support for it collapsed. But he has appeared to realise he cannot return to command economics - and thus Russia has lurched towards a 'normal' economy, though without any certainty of succeeding in it.<p>



He has rarely been an inspirational leader, except at the beginning of his run for power: more frequently in recent years, he has been a disgraceful one, appearing drunk on several public occasions (or, in the case of his 'visit' to Ireland in 1994, not appearing). He has claimed parity with the main western states for a country manifestly not at their economic level. He has been dismissive of or threatening to many of the leaders of the former Soviet states all about him.<p>



But he has confined his 'imperialism' to vague threats and growlings. The 'union' between Belarus and Russia is a mess, but it is a mess produced most of all by Alexander Lukashenko, the genuinely authoritarian president of Belarus: Yeltsin grasped at a treaty of union because it was an election ploy, not because Russia had forced Belarus back into an empire. Ukraine shows every sign of wishing to remain a separate state: and though Yeltsin has snubbed the Ukrainian leaders, he has not threatened the state's independence. The record of Russia towards these states has not been uniformly bad: where Georgia was reduced to acquiescence with the assistance of Russian arms, the Baltics have been left alone.<p>



Why talk only of Yeltsin and Zyuganov? Because, two months before the vote, it seems as if they will be the two contestants in the final round. As this is written, a 'third force' is trying to coalesce round General Alexander Lebed: and Grigory Havlinsky and Vladimir Zhirinovsky are also candidates - as is Mikhail Gorbachev. None - it seems, presently - will be able to match the leads which Zyuganov and Yeltsin are building up.<p>



For the democrats, the failure to produce a strong candidate round whom they could unite is particularly bitter. Yavlinsky has the best claims on that: he has, in four years of opposition, continued to represent a centrist-liberal position. He has been strongly against the Chechen war: supported freedoms: supported a liberal economy. But jealousies among the democrats have been at least as strong as those among the nationalists (and much stronger than among the Communists and their allies, where habits of discipline appear to have lingered), Yavlinsky, too, has been abrasive and apparently uninterested in agreements: the result has been that Yeltsin, against the odds, has retained the reluctant support of a large number of those whose consciences he has outraged.<p>



This is not a pre-election scene to bring joy to any hearts, Russian or foreign. But it may not produce despair.<p>

<h2>'Power to the people' land-reformers defy critics</h2>

<h3>By Eddie Koch,  environmental reporter with the Johannesburg Weekly Mail</h3>

Johannesburg: South Africa is pushing ahead with an ambitious land-reform programme despite attacks from right and left.<p>

White commercial farmers say new black settlers will spoil the soil through improper farming - causing food shortages. Other opponents of the scheme say the poorest people will not benefit, and that much of the state cash being invested in it will end up in the pockets of local elites.
Minister of Land Affairs Derek Hanekom is determined to prove the critics wrong.<p>

Current land ownership, strongly favouring the minority whites, is a legacy of the apartheid era. Little more than 10 per cent of the population  owns 87 per cent of the best agricultural land, while much of the black majority lives on poorer terrain in overcrowded reserves set aside under the old system of segregation.<p>

Conflict over land, say University of Cape Town academics Mamphela Ramphele and Francis Wilson in a recent book, Uprooting Poverty,  "runs like a seismic fault through the body of South Africa...(and) threatens to engulf the country in the flames of civil war".<p>

Hanekom plans to change all this. His programme, launched earlier in 1995, is designed to redistribute about 30 per cent of arable land over five years.<p>

The reform plans consist of separate restitution and redistribution schemes.<p>

A Land Claims Court has been established, with the power to restore title to people - or their descendants - who were forcibly removed from their property under apartheid. In all, 3.5 million were evicted.  Compensation will be paid to current owners.<p>

The redistribution scheme will allow rural people to buy out white farmers who are willing to sell. No land will be expropriated. Unused tracts of state land will also be offered for sale at subsidised prices.
The emphasis is on empowering local people to plan and manage their own development, says Hanekom, a land specialist.<p>

"Our approach to land distribution ... is a demand-led or needs-driven process, rather than one imposed from above by the state," he says.
"The beneficiary groups will identify their own needs, develop their own plans and make decisions on the allocation of funds within the department's policy framework... It is important not to repeat the iniquities of the past."<p>

His ministry has launched nine pilot schemes,  one in each of the country's new provinces.<p>

A total of  315.81 million rand (about $88 million) has been allocated for the entire process. Each pilot scheme will receive 35 million rand ($9.7 million).  More than 50 per cent of the grant will provide essential social needs, such as shelter, sanitation, water supply, schools and electricity.
A national task force of government and non-government organisations has been set up to implement the plan. Beneath this are provincial-level steering committees,  which will employ pilot managers and establish district land reform forums.<p>


These elected bodies will be given the right and the money to appoint professional advisers to assist in devising a development plan for the newly-acquired land. The forums will consider economic potential and propose uses for various plots that must be ecologically sustainable.
Conservative commercial farmers say the new settlers will degrade the land by placing too heavy a burden of animals and people on it and by using outdated farming methods. Moving inexperienced farmers on to productive land, they say, will begin to undermine the country's breadbasket of mainly white-owned farming estates - increasing the risk of famine.<p>

Meanwhile,  a liberal farmer, Graham Macintosh, from KwaZulu-Natal province, says: "All Hanekom is doing is spreading rural poverty from where it exists to the new land that is being made available for settlement."<p>

A black elite comprised of teachers, taxi owners and local chiefs had already taken command of the rural forums, he said. "These people will always find creative ways of ensuring that the lion's share of the resources now being pumped into the area goes into their pockets. If you are serious about the poorest of the poor, then much more attention should be paid to the conditions of farm workers. It is the efficient commercial farmers who should be promoted and then encouraged to treat their workforces in a decent way."<p>

Ironically,  this view is supported by the research findings of John Sender, a left-wing economist from the University of Witwatersrand, who predicts that the poorest will not benefit.  His work indicates that five to six million rural people are completely dependent for their survival on wages obtained from labouring on commercial farms.<p>

"The issues of poverty and gender are not taken seriously (under the land-reform plans)," he says. "Rather, the vision is of a package of state subsidies to a class of male black capitalists."<p>

But Hanekom defends his programme, saying: "We want people to make sound decisions based on access to a resource that has to be used beneficially and sustainably."<p>

Concerns about possible degradation of land re-allocated to black settlers can be dealt with in the local forums.  Plans submitted by these to provincial reform committees will be carefully scrutinised for their sustainability, says Sue Lund, manager of the redistribution programme. "Their plans will have to meet strict standards and must be environmentally sustainable."<p>

She admits the scheme may be over-ambitious. "How this will work in practice, we will have to wait and see."<p>

But rural people have been emboldened by the plans and are confident they will work. Mpase Ndladla,  a black farmer from KwaZulu-Natal, says: "Our message to the white farmers who are saying we will destroy our new land is that, frankly, we thought of taking it back by force.
"But we didn't want bloodshed and war. Now that we are able to sit down and discuss things like brothers, we can be given training and advice from the neighbouring white farmers about how to use this land.
"We should unite," he adds. "We can make it work."<p>

&eacute;conomiques. Sa part du produit national brut japonais
(0,26 %) place n&eacute;anmoins le Japon au 18&egrave;me rang
des pays industrialis&eacute;s. Jusqu'aux ann&eacute;es 1980,
l'aide publique nippone &eacute;tait principalement une aide li&eacute;e,
qui contraignait les pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires &agrave;
s'approvisionner en biens ou en services aupr&egrave;s d'entreprises
japonaises. Cette aide &eacute;tait marqu&eacute;e par la promotion
des exportations et l'implantation des entreprises japonaises
dans les pays du Sud. Cependant, le pourcentage des pr&ecirc;ts
non li&eacute;s ou &#171;d&eacute;li&eacute;s&#187; s'&eacute;levait
en 1993 &agrave; 97 % et la part des commandes pass&eacute;es
aux entreprises japonaises &eacute;tait tomb&eacute;e &agrave;
moins de 30 % (contre 67 % en 1986). Cette &eacute;volution n'est
pas all&eacute;e sans m&eacute;contenter les entreprises japonaises,
surtout en p&eacute;riode de mauvaise conjoncture.
<P>
La part la plus importante de l'aide est traditionnellement dirig&eacute;e
vers l'Asie (60 % du volume total en 1993), l'Afrique sub-saharienne
et l'Am&eacute;rique latine se partageant l'une et l'autre 10
%. La contribution multilat&eacute;rale publique, malgr&eacute;
sa part relativement modeste par rapport &agrave; l'aide bilat&eacute;rale
(29 % contre 71 % en 1993), est rest&eacute;e importante dans
les institutions financi&egrave;res internationales comme la Banque
mondiale, la Banque asiatique de d&eacute;veloppement, le Fonds
de d&eacute;veloppement am&eacute;ricain. Le Japon y appara&icirc;t
parmi les plus importants bailleurs de fonds avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis.
<P>
<H3>Une charte peu appliqu&eacute;e</H3>
<P>
La chute du Mur de Berlin a permis au Japon non seulement d'engager
une aide en direction des pays de l'Est ou encore du Vietnam,
mais aussi d'adopter en 1992 une charte de l'APD. Celle-ci pr&eacute;cise
les quatre principes retenus pour l'octroi d'une aide : le respect
de l'environnement, la non-utilisation militaire de l'aide, l'&eacute;tat
de la militarisation du pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, et enfin
le choix en faveur de la d&eacute;mocratisation et de l'&eacute;conomie
de march&eacute;. Malgr&eacute; son apparence humanitaire, le
bilan d'application de la charte est rest&eacute; m&eacute;diocre
: seuls les pays du Sud qui n'entrent pas en conflit direct avec
les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts nationaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; concern&eacute;s,
tel Ha&iuml;ti ou la Gambie. Le r&eacute;gime militaire de Myanmar<a href="#myan">(1)</a>
&agrave; qui, depuis le coup d'&Eacute;tat de 1988, le Japon avait
suspendu l'aide, a &eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; nouveau consid&eacute;r&eacute;,
en mars 1995, comme pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire de l'aide
humanitaire sous la pression des <I>lobbies</I> politiques et
commerciaux japonais.
<P>
L'&eacute;mergence et la pr&eacute;sence des organisations non
gouvernementales (ONG) doivent &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre soulign&eacute;es.
En 1993, environ 300 ONG japonaises travaillaient dans le cadre
de la coop&eacute;ration avec le Sud (...).
<P>
<H3>De profondes mutations </H3>
<P>
La nature et l'orientation de la politique de l'aide japonaise
ont connu trois mutations. La premi&egrave;re r&eacute;side dans
la tendance de plus en plus affirm&eacute;e &agrave; la &#171;japonisation&#187;
de l'aide publique. Ne se r&eacute;signant plus au r&ocirc;le
de bailleur de fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;reux et silencieux, l'Etat
japonais cherche &agrave; donner &agrave; sa politique d'aide
une certaine originalit&eacute; par rapport aux pays occidentaux.
En t&eacute;moignent la valorisation fr&eacute;quente du succ&egrave;s
&eacute;conomique japonais au nom des &#171;exp&eacute;riences
japonaises&#187; ou l'&eacute;vocation des &#171;le&ccedil;ons
de l'Asie de l'Est&#187; dans les instances internationales, telle
que la Conf&eacute;rence internationale sur le d&eacute;veloppement
de l'Afrique en 1993. La r&eacute;serve &eacute;mise par le Fonds
de coop&eacute;ration &eacute;conomique d'outre-mer sur la politique
de lib&eacute;ralisation &eacute;conomique tous azimuts pr&ocirc;n&eacute;e
et impos&eacute;e pour les pays du Sud par la Banque mondiale
s'inscrira aussi comme une tentative de se faire remarquer par
sa position pour l'intervention publique dans les march&eacute;s
locaux.
<P>
La deuxi&egrave;me mutation devrait se traduire, dans la perspective
d'une r&eacute;duction attendue de l'aide des pays du Nord impliquant
t&ocirc;t ou tard le Japon, par une coordination trilat&eacute;rale
plus intense Japon-&Eacute;tats-Unis-Union europ&eacute;enne,
en vue d'utiliser l'aide comme moyen d'aborder les probl&egrave;mes
globaux tels l'environnement, la drogue, le Sida, le sort des
r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s, l'&eacute;volution d&eacute;mographique,
qui peuvent avoir des r&eacute;percussions sur la s&eacute;curit&eacute;
des pays du Nord. Cependant, il appara&icirc;t souvent que l'objectif
consiste &agrave; contenir les effets des difficult&eacute;s du
Sud dans le Sud au nom d'un nouvel ordre &eacute;conomique international
plus juste, projet qui avait marqu&eacute; les relations Nord-Sud
dans les ann&eacute;es 1970. Enfin, la troisi&egrave;me mutation
a trait &agrave; l'exigence croissante des citoyens japonais pour
une plus large transparence de la politique de coop&eacute;ration
et une participation plus concr&egrave;te &agrave; la mise en
oeuvre de l'aide. Dans un pays comme le Japon o&ugrave; la supr&eacute;matie
de l'Etat est une tradition mill&eacute;naire, l'ouverture des
dossiers de la coop&eacute;ration et la cr&eacute;ation d'un syst&egrave;me
ind&eacute;pendant de suivi et de concertation constituent un
des enjeux cruciaux pour mesurer le degr&eacute; de maturit&eacute;
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;
de l'Etat lorsqu'il pr&ocirc;ne une solidarit&eacute; plus r&eacute;elle
entre le Nord et le Sud.

L'aide bilat&eacute;rale japonaise se d&eacute;compose comme suit
: la moiti&eacute; sert &agrave; financer des infrastructures
ou des projets industriels, en bref des &#171;op&eacute;rations
intensives en capital&#187;, refl&eacute;tant l'importance des
importations de biens d'&eacute;quipement n&eacute;cessaires &agrave;
ces projets ; une part relativement &eacute;lev&eacute;e concerne
les pr&ecirc;ts destin&eacute;s aux &eacute;tudes de faisabilit&eacute;,
&agrave; l'assistance technique et &agrave; la formation de cadres
; un faible montant est consacr&eacute; aux programmes d'importation
de biens ; la satisfaction des besoins fondamentaux ne repr&eacute;sente
qu'une fraction n&eacute;gligeable du total, en partie &agrave;
cause du manque de personnel exp&eacute;riment&eacute; dans l'application
de ce type de programme.
<P>
L'aide japonaise est tr&egrave;s int&eacute;gr&eacute;e aux autres
programmes officiels de cr&eacute;dit de d&eacute;veloppement,
formant ainsi une strat&eacute;gie globale de commerce et d'aide
au d&eacute;veloppement destin&eacute;e essentiellement &agrave;
l'Asie de l'Est et du Sud. Un fonds de 2 milliards de dollars
a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tabli en 1987 pour soutenir les investissements
priv&eacute;s japonais au sein de l'Association des nations du
Sud-Est asiatique (Asean), incluant l'apport de capitaux propres.
Le minist&egrave;re du Commerce international et de l'Industrie
(Miti) fournit des garanties contre le risque commercial et politique
des investissements &agrave; l'&eacute;tranger.
<P>
La logique de la coop&eacute;ration japonaise s'appuie sur le
succ&egrave;s &eacute;conomique du Japon apr&egrave;s 1945, fond&eacute;
sur le secteur priv&eacute;, qui assure un niveau soutenu d'investissements
et une force de travail disciplin&eacute;e, mais &eacute;galement
sur le gouvernement. Pour aider les pays en d&eacute;veloppement,
l'&Eacute;tat japonais finance les projets d'infrastructure et
les importations indispensables, tandis que les investisseurs
japonais apportent des capitaux priv&eacute;s, contribuent &agrave;
former des gestionnaires et &agrave; diffuser la technologie.
L'&eacute;change s'approfondit ainsi au b&eacute;n&eacute;fice
de tous. Cette strat&eacute;gie est officiellement connue sous
le nom de &#171;vol d'oies sauvages&#187;, le Japon, naturellement,
dirigeant la troupe.
<P>
<H3>Int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts commerciaux</H3>
<P>
L'aide japonaise n'&eacute;chappe
pas aux critiques, &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur comme &agrave;
l'ext&eacute;rieur du pays. On &eacute;voque les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
commerciaux qui la motivent, on accuse les entreprises japonaises
d'influencer outre mesure le choix des projets. Dans la phase
pr&eacute;paratoire, les ing&eacute;nieurs japonais et les entreprises
qui offrent des services prennent contact avec les agences charg&eacute;es
d'appliquer les projets dans le pays d'accueil, par exemple les
autorit&eacute;s locales. Des relations &eacute;troites entre
officiels japonais et repr&eacute;sentants du secteur priv&eacute;
sont fr&eacute;quentes et des cas de corruption sont &eacute;voqu&eacute;s.
Quant au Miti, il joue un r&ocirc;le central dans la s&eacute;lection
finale du projet.
<P>
Plus que tout autre donateur, le Japon s'est efforc&eacute; de
ne plus lier son aide &agrave; des clauses commerciales et de
faire jouer la concurrence internationale. N&eacute;anmoins, la
fonction strat&eacute;gique d'ing&eacute;nierie d'un projet demeure
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement r&eacute;serv&eacute;e aux entreprises
japonaises, qui sont de ce fait extr&ecirc;mement bien plac&eacute;es
lors des ench&egrave;res internationales...

<HR>
<I>L'Allemagne tente de contraindre le gouvernement et les s&eacute;paratistes
sri-lankais &agrave; respecter les droits de la personne en r&eacute;duisant
son aide au d&eacute;veloppement. Mais si l'ensemble des donateurs
n'adoptent pas une politique comparable, ses efforts resteront
lettre morte.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Le Sri Lanka pose de fa&ccedil;on aigu&euml; la question de l'efficacit&eacute;
des conditionnalit&eacute;s de l'aide. Marqu&eacute; par un long
conflit ethnique et des violations r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;es
des droits de l'Homme, ce pays re&ccedil;oit en effet l'aide par
habitant la plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e de toute l'Asie du Sud.
Ces contributions sont d'autant plus importantes que l'investissement
priv&eacute; tend parall&egrave;lement &agrave; baisser. L'Allemagne
f&eacute;d&eacute;rale, troisi&egrave;me bailleur de fonds du
Sri Lanka apr&egrave;s le Japon et les &Eacute;tats-Unis, s'est
engag&eacute;e depuis 1980 en faveur de la d&eacute;fense des
droits de l'Homme et a pos&eacute; en 1991 de strictes conditions
&agrave; l'octroi de son aide.
<P>
Pays multi-ethnique, le Sri-Lanka se compose de trois groupes
humains principaux : les Cingalais de religion bouddhiste, qui
dominent au sein du gouvernement, les Tamouls de religion sikh
et les Musulmans. Le pogrom tamoul de 1983 a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;
au monde l'existence d'un conflit ethnique orchestr&eacute; par
les forces gouvernementales, que les diplomates occidentaux craignaient
de voir d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rer en guerre civile. Or, jusqu'en
1991, la moiti&eacute; de l'aide financi&egrave;re allemande au
Sri Lanka a servi &agrave; soutenir des programmes de prestige
du gouvernement. En particulier, les deux barrages du projet <I>Mahaveli</I>
ont capt&eacute; l'essentiel de l'aide allemande et des fonds
de la Banque mondiale. D&egrave;s la fin du premier barrage en
1986, le gouvernement a obtenu l'accord des donateurs sur le financement
du second. Les observateurs &eacute;trangers savaient pourtant
que le projet <I>Mahaveli</I> suscitait l'opposition des milieux
tamouls, car il pr&eacute;voyait la colonisation par les Cingalais
d'une zone peupl&eacute;e essentiellement de Tamouls. La reconduction
de la deuxi&egrave;me tranche des travaux ne pouvait donc &ecirc;tre
consid&eacute;r&eacute;e par les Tamouls que comme le signe du
soutien occidental - et notamment allemand - au gouvernement,
qui continuait de refuser l'&eacute;galit&eacute; entre ethnies.
En 1992, la Coop&eacute;ration allemande a approuv&eacute; le
d&eacute;placement autoritaire de populations tamoules dans le
cadre de la construction des barrages. Son rapport dressait un
bilan plut&ocirc;t positif de l'op&eacute;ration, les groupes
d&eacute;plac&eacute;s s'int&eacute;grant ainsi dans une &eacute;conomie
mon&eacute;taire plus dynamique que leur syst&egrave;me traditionnel.
<P>
<H3>Guerre civile</H3>
<P>
L'Allemagne peut toutefois difficilement &ecirc;tre accus&eacute;e
d'avoir voulu p&eacute;naliser les Tamouls. Elle cherchait au
contraire &agrave; r&eacute;&eacute;quilibrer la r&eacute;partition
traditionnelle du d&eacute;veloppement au Sri Lanka - notamment
en finan&ccedil;ant la fabrique de papier de Embalipitiya et le
syst&egrave;me d'adduction d'eau de Kirindi Oya dans le nord du
pays domin&eacute; par les Tamouls et &eacute;conomiquement n&eacute;glig&eacute;
depuis deux si&egrave;cles. Elle a d'ailleurs maintenu son action
entre la guerre civile de 1983 et l'insurrection des extr&eacute;mistes
cingalais du Front de lib&eacute;ration du peuple (JVP) en 1989
bien que les zones d'intervention fussent devenues incontr&ocirc;lables.
De m&ecirc;me, la poursuite des projets techniques jusqu'en 1991,
alors que l'aide financi&egrave;re &eacute;tait suspendue, traduit
une volont&eacute; de r&eacute;&eacute;quilibrage entre les r&eacute;gions
et les secteurs d'activit&eacute;. Par exemple, les actions de
formation men&eacute;es aupr&egrave;s des Tamouls dans les plantations
&eacute;taient d'autant plus importantes sur le plan politique
que les gouvernements successifs comme les syndicats tamouls n&eacute;gligeaient
ce type de projets.
<P>
Mais la guerre civile allait contrarier ces orientations. Petit
&agrave; petit, non seulement le Nord peupl&eacute; de Tamouls
et l'Est pluri-confessionnel sont devenus inaccessibles, mais
l'&eacute;tat de si&egrave;ge a entrav&eacute; les interventions
dans le Sud &agrave; majorit&eacute; cingalaise. Les projets destin&eacute;s
aux populations les plus marginales et aux r&eacute;gions p&eacute;riph&eacute;riques
ont finalement &eacute;t&eacute; limit&eacute;s aux Cingalais
et se sont cantonn&eacute;s aux r&eacute;gions fid&egrave;les
au gouvernement. Cette &eacute;volution a indirectement renforc&eacute;
les revendications des Tamouls, qui d&eacute;non&ccedil;aient
l'accaparement de l'aide par les Cingalais.
<P>
A partir de 1987, la communaut&eacute; internationale a financ&eacute;
des programmes de reconstruction, principalement dans le nord
et l'est du pays. La Coop&eacute;ration allemande s'est ainsi
retrouv&eacute;e politiquement impliqu&eacute;e dans l'&eacute;volution
du r&eacute;gime. La croissance des d&eacute;penses militaires,
les destructions et les dettes caus&eacute;es par le soul&egrave;vement
du JVP, les promesses &eacute;lectorales douteuses du programme
social <I>Janansaviya </I>du Parti national unifi&eacute; (UNP,
au pouvoir de 1978 &agrave; 1995) ont conduit l'&Eacute;tat au
bord de la faillite financi&egrave;re en 1989. Le gouvernement
s'est ainsi vu contraint d'accepter les conditions de la Banque
mondiale et du Fonds mon&eacute;taire international et d'adopter
un plan d'ajustement structurel. Pour contrer une pauvret&eacute;
et un m&eacute;contentement social croissants, &eacute;viter de
nouvelles r&eacute;voltes sociales et honorer au moins les grands
lignes du programme <I>Janansaviya</I>, la Banque a d&eacute;fini
un programme de lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;. L'aide allemande
a soutenu ces mesures d'accompagnement social par une contribution
de 15 millions de marks.
<P>
Malgr&eacute; sa volont&eacute; de neutralit&eacute; dans la question
ethnique, la Coop&eacute;ration allemande s'est retrouv&eacute;e
partie prenante du conflit. La guerre civile a gravement nui aux
projets, r&eacute;duisant leur efficacit&eacute; aupr&egrave;s
de certains groupes et dans certaines r&eacute;gions. Elle a contraint
les donateurs &agrave; abandonner leur objectif de d&eacute;veloppement
pour s'occuper de la survie des civils, de la reconstruction puis,
indirectement, de la stabilisation du r&eacute;gime. Ils ont ainsi
cautionn&eacute; involontairement le gouvernement, coupable d'atteintes
aux droits de l'Homme de plus en plus nombreuses.
<P>
<H3>Pressions allemandes</H3>
<P>
Les violations constat&eacute;es pendant la r&eacute;pression
du soul&egrave;vement du JVP ont pouss&eacute; la Coop&eacute;ration
allemande &agrave; r&eacute;duire son aide. Les montants allou&eacute;s
en 1990 (42,3 millions de marks) ne repr&eacute;sentaient plus
qu'un tiers de ceux attribu&eacute;s en 1985 (157,7 millions).
Cette baisse s'est poursuivie jusqu'en 1993. Le Sri Lanka s'est
donc vu sanctionn&eacute; un an avant que le minist&egrave;re
de la Coop&eacute;ration ne d&eacute;cide de conditionner son
aide au respect de crit&egrave;res politiques et humanitaires.
Cette r&eacute;duction visait clairement le gouvernement. Elle
s'est accompagn&eacute;e en outre d'une modification du choix
des partenaires et des objectifs. Dans le cadre du programme de
la Banque mondiale contre la pauvret&eacute;, l'Allemagne a d&eacute;sormais
privil&eacute;gi&eacute; la participation d'organisations non
gouvernementales locales. L'aide aux r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s et
le d&eacute;veloppement agricole ont re&ccedil;u une attention
particuli&egrave;re.
<P>
Toutefois, le gouvernement UNP a appris &agrave; composer avec
ce type de critiques et mis sur pied une cour de justice sp&eacute;ciale
destin&eacute;e &agrave; examiner les plaintes contre les violations
des droits de l'Homme. En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, cette institution
n'a jamais v&eacute;ritablement fonctionn&eacute;. Son r&ocirc;le
consistait &agrave; mettre le gouvernement &agrave; l'abri des
critiques et &agrave; condamner d'anciennes violations pour en
camoufler de nouvelles. D'o&ugrave; la question de l'efficacit&eacute;
&eacute;conomique et politique de la r&eacute;duction de l'aide
; comparer le r&ocirc;le de l'Allemagne &agrave; l'action des
autres bailleurs peut apporter un d&eacute;but de r&eacute;ponse.
<P>
L'Allemagne ne repr&eacute;sentant qu'un huiti&egrave;me de l'aide
bilat&eacute;rale accord&eacute;e au Sri Lanka - les aides am&eacute;ricaine
et japonaise totalisent les deux cinqui&egrave;mes -, la r&eacute;duction
de l'aide accord&eacute;e ne pouvait qu'affaiblir son pouvoir
de pression face au Japon et aux &Eacute;tats-Unis qui n'&eacute;taient
pas partisans d'une telle utilisation politique de l'aide.
<P>
Parall&egrave;lement, l'adoption du plan d'ajustement structurel
a fait doubler l'aide multilat&eacute;rale, r&eacute;duisant encore
l'impact des critiques des petits bailleurs bilat&eacute;raux.
L'ajustement fixe en outre de nouvelles priorit&eacute;s &agrave;
l'&Eacute;tat sri lankais : &eacute;quilibre du budget public
et lib&eacute;ralisation de l'&eacute;conomie. Le gouvernement
peut donc esquiver la question des cons&eacute;quences morales
du conflit civil et la responsabilit&eacute; de la guerre pour
se concentrer sur ses retomb&eacute;es &eacute;conomiques. Les
effets symboliques et &eacute;conomiques de la baisse de la coop&eacute;ration
allemande devraient ainsi rester marginaux tant que l'ensemble
des donateurs et des institutions internationales ne l'imitent
pas.

<I>La lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; est devenue le ma&icirc;tre
mot des politiques d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement. Pourtant, derri&egrave;re
diff&eacute;rents termes et diff&eacute;rentes interpr&eacute;tations,
l'aide a toujours eu pour objectif d'am&eacute;liorer le sort
des pauvres. Analyse d'un africaniste norv&eacute;gien.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Le concept d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement a consid&eacute;rablement
&eacute;volu&eacute; au cours des quarante derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es.
Un mod&egrave;le chassant l'autre, on a d'abord eu foi dans la
logique de la croissance &eacute;conomique, source de d&eacute;veloppement,
puis dans les vertus explicatives de la th&eacute;orie de la d&eacute;pendance,
avant d'accorder dans les ann&eacute;es 1970 une attention particuli&egrave;re
aux besoins fondamentaux des populations pauvres.
<P>
Depuis une dizaine d'ann&eacute;es, le concept dominant est celui
d'aide cibl&eacute;e destin&eacute;e &agrave; lutter contre la
pauvret&eacute;. Ce terme semble donner une dimension nouvelle
&agrave; la notion traditionnelle d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement,
alors qu'en r&eacute;alit&eacute; l'aide contre la pauvret&eacute;
n'est qu'un des nombreux types d'aide qui s'attaquent au probl&egrave;me
de la pauvret&eacute;.
<P>
<H3>Un concept &agrave; la mode</H3>
<P>
L'aide a-t-elle pour objectif final d'&eacute;liminer la pauvret&eacute;,
de la r&eacute;duire ou de l'all&eacute;ger ? La litt&eacute;rature
sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e a malheureusement tendance &agrave;
employer indiff&eacute;remment ces termes. Mettons le premier
de c&ocirc;t&eacute;, dans la mesure o&ugrave; aucun donateur
ne peut se vanter de pouvoir &eacute;liminer la pauvret&eacute;.
La r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute;, quant &agrave; elle,
implique des actions d'ensemble sur le long terme, s'attaquant
aux causes profondes du mal, tandis que les interventions destin&eacute;es
&agrave; all&eacute;ger la pauvret&eacute; n'en traitent que les
sympt&ocirc;mes.
<P>
Dans les ann&eacute;es 1950, les &eacute;conomistes s'inspirent
des th&eacute;ories keyn&eacute;siennes sur l'intervention de
l'&Eacute;tat et des exp&eacute;riences de transfert de capital
des &Eacute;tats-Unis vers l'Europe apr&egrave;s la Seconde Guerre
mondiale. Interpr&eacute;tant la pauvret&eacute; comme la cons&eacute;quence
du sous-d&eacute;veloppement, ils d&eacute;fendent la modernisation
rapide des moyens de production, gr&acirc;ce en particulier &agrave;
l'action de l'&Eacute;tat, pour stimuler la croissance &eacute;conomique
et r&eacute;duire ainsi la pauvret&eacute;. A l'inverse des conceptions
&#171;modernistes&#187;, la th&eacute;orie de la d&eacute;pendance
&eacute;labor&eacute;e au cours des ann&eacute;es 1960 analyse
le sous-d&eacute;veloppement en termes d'in&eacute;galit&eacute;s
de pouvoir. Elle identifie deux rapports de domination distincts.
Le principal est l'oppression du Sud par le Nord. Le second tient
au r&ocirc;le ambivalent des &Eacute;tats en d&eacute;veloppement
: d'un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, ils repr&eacute;sentent les nations
opprim&eacute;es sur la sc&egrave;ne internationale, de l'autre,
ils sont dirig&eacute;s par des &eacute;lites qui exploitent le
peuple pauvre. Mais alors que les &#171;modernistes&#187; ont
un poids consid&eacute;rable sur l'ensemble des programmes d'aide,
l'influence des &#171;d&eacute;pendantistes&#187; s'exerce de
fa&ccedil;on indirecte. Leur hostilit&eacute; fondamentale au
capitalisme est en effet difficilement acceptable par la Banque
mondiale ou la plupart des parlements d'Europe et des &Eacute;tats-Unis.
<P>
<H3>La fin des mod&egrave;les universels</H3>
<P>
L'&eacute;chec de ces deux mod&egrave;les, qui se pr&eacute;tendaient
universels, est patent &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es 1970.
La faillite de la th&eacute;orie de la d&eacute;pendance laisse
un vide intellectuel qui ne sera pas combl&eacute;. Mais d&egrave;s
la fin des ann&eacute;es 1960, l'incapacit&eacute; des politiques
de modernisation &agrave; engendrer la croissance tant attendue
convainc la Banque mondiale et les principaux donateurs de la
n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de modifier leur action. La strat&eacute;gie
des besoins fondamentaux exerce une influence croissante sur les
programmes d'aide au cours de la d&eacute;cennie 1970-1980. D&eacute;sormais,
les politiques d'aide privil&eacute;gient la production agricole,
les infrastructures qui touchent de pr&egrave;s les populations
pauvres (alimentation en eau, hygi&egrave;ne, sant&eacute; et
&eacute;ducation) et les industries intensives en travail. Cet
engouement en faveur de la strat&eacute;gie des besoins fondamentaux
s'explique parce qu'elle permet toutes les interpr&eacute;tations.
En s'attelant &agrave; la fois &agrave; la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;
et &agrave; la croissance, elle r&eacute;concilie en apparence
les deux grands courants id&eacute;ologiques.
<P>
La Banque mondiale, l'un des donateurs les plus critiques &agrave;
l'&eacute;gard de la th&eacute;orie de la d&eacute;pendance, enrichit
ainsi le mod&egrave;le traditionnel de croissance &eacute;conomique
avec des indicateurs sociaux. A l'inverse, la social-d&eacute;mocratie
europ&eacute;enne, influenc&eacute;e par les th&egrave;ses d&eacute;pendantistes,
privil&eacute;gie la r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute; plut&ocirc;t
que la croissance. Pour elle, la r&eacute;ussite des programmes
d'aide exige de donner aux populations cibles les moyens de s'organiser
contre les forces qui les maintiennent dans la pr&eacute;carit&eacute;.
Des projets ruraux tentent notamment de regrouper les producteurs
en coop&eacute;ratives contre les n&eacute;gociants priv&eacute;s
ou les patrons. Les pays o&ugrave; l'audience des sociaux-d&eacute;mocrates
est forte participent &eacute;galement activement &agrave; la
cr&eacute;ation de la Conf&eacute;rence des Nations unies pour
la coop&eacute;ration et le d&eacute;veloppement (Cnuced) et aux
discussions autour du nouvel ordre &eacute;conomique international.
<P>
<H3>Du discr&eacute;dit de l'&Eacute;tat&#133;</H3>
<P>
Les ann&eacute;es 1980 marquent un tournant. Le r&ocirc;le essentiel
des conditions locales dans le succ&egrave;s des programmes d'aide
commence &agrave; &ecirc;tre reconnu, de m&ecirc;me que l'importance
de la participation des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires. Tandis que
l'&Eacute;tat est accus&eacute; de corruption et d'inefficacit&eacute;,
on d&eacute;couvre &agrave; quel point les r&eacute;actions individuelles
aux politiques gouvernementales peuvent influer sur l'efficacit&eacute;
de celles-ci. Les donateurs changent d'interlocuteur et s'adressent
directement aux populations qu'ils entendent aider. Pourtant,
ce scepticisme &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'&Eacute;tat, partag&eacute;
par tous les donateurs, ne met pas fin aux diff&eacute;rences
d'interpr&eacute;tation.
<P>
Nous retrouvons la vieille dichotomie priorit&eacute; &agrave;
la croissance/priorit&eacute; &agrave; la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;.
Les d&eacute;fenseurs du premier terme de l'alternative se m&eacute;fient
d'autant plus des appareils d'&Eacute;tat des pays en d&eacute;veloppement
qu'ils sont sensibles &agrave; l'influence croissante du lib&eacute;ralisme
&eacute;conomique. Pour les bailleurs de fonds multilat&eacute;raux,
en premier lieu la Banque mondiale, la notion de participation
populaire signifie cr&eacute;er un march&eacute; respectant la
loi de l'offre et de la demande, o&ugrave; l'&Eacute;tat joue
un simple r&ocirc;le de r&eacute;gulateur et d'arbitre entre acteurs
priv&eacute;s. La Banque op&egrave;re toutefois une rupture avec
les &#171;modernistes&#187; et se rapproche de l'&eacute;cole
de la d&eacute;pendance ; elle d&eacute;fend l'id&eacute;e que
de profondes transformations sociales destin&eacute;es &agrave;
renforcer le r&ocirc;le des acteurs priv&eacute;s et des institutions
sont indispensables &agrave; la croissance et &agrave; la lutte
contre la pauvret&eacute;. Les programmes d'ajustement structurel
que la Banque mondiale et certaines institutions bilat&eacute;rales
mettent en place conditionnent d&eacute;sormais l'octroi de l'aide
financi&egrave;re &agrave; la contraction des structures et des
d&eacute;penses &eacute;tatiques. La Banque ne s'&eacute;loigne
cependant pas de l'objectif de r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute;.
Comme l'atteste la structure de ses cr&eacute;dits, elle est sensible
aux co&ucirc;ts sociaux des programmes d'ajustement. En 1986-1987,
par exemple, 29 % des pr&ecirc;ts de la Banque et de l'Association
internationale pour le d&eacute;veloppement sont destin&eacute;s
&agrave; des secteurs qui concernent la population pauvre. Des
programmes sp&eacute;cifiques sont mis en place, comme le Programme
d'action pour compenser le co&ucirc;t social de l'ajustement au
Ghana, qui ne visent toutefois qu'&agrave; all&eacute;ger les
cons&eacute;quences sociales de l'ajustement et non &agrave; r&eacute;duire
la pauvret&eacute; de mani&egrave;re durable.
<P>
<H3>&#133;&agrave; l'aide cibl&eacute;e</H3>
<P>
Les donateurs qui, sous l'influence des th&egrave;ses d&eacute;pendantistes,
privil&eacute;gient la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; interpr&egrave;tent
diff&eacute;remment la strat&eacute;gie de participation populairet.
Selon eux, les communaut&eacute;s locales sont opprim&eacute;es
par un &Eacute;tat parasite. Leur ancienne pr&eacute;occupation
&#171;comment r&eacute;duire la pauvret&eacute; ?&#187; devient
&#171;comment atteindre les pauvres et quelles activit&eacute;s
leur seraient utiles ?&#187;. Ils estiment que seules les populations-cibles
sont &agrave; m&ecirc;me de conna&icirc;tre leurs besoins. Il
convient donc de soutenir les institutions locales, source d'harmonie,
sans chercher &agrave; les transformer, sans mettre en cause leur
caract&egrave;re d&eacute;mocratique moderne. Ce faisant, l'aide
contre la pauvret&eacute;, d&eacute;sormais synonyme d'aide cibl&eacute;e,
se cantonne aux actions de court terme envers les pauvres. Il
n'est plus question de r&eacute;duire la pauvret&eacute; gr&acirc;ce
&agrave; de profonds changements des relations sociales, mais
simplement de l'all&eacute;ger. L'aide contre la pauvret&eacute;
d&eacute;g&eacute;n&egrave;re ainsi en un programme global de
charit&eacute;, sans lien avec le plan d'ensemble de d&eacute;veloppement
&eacute;conomique et social que la strat&eacute;gie des besoins
fondamentaux pr&eacute;conisait. Les probl&egrave;mes de long
terme sont laiss&eacute;s &agrave; d'autres : l'ajustement structurel
devient la seule strat&eacute;gie qui tente d'appr&eacute;hender
la pauvret&eacute; d'un point de vue d'ensemble, les actions cibl&eacute;es
permettant de r&eacute;duire le co&ucirc;t social de l'ajustement.
<P>
L'audience croissante de la strat&eacute;gie d'aide cibl&eacute;e
est due en partie au courant de sympathie de certains hommes politiques
des &Eacute;tats donateurs en faveur des organisations non gouvernementales
(ONG) et &agrave; leur scepticisme &agrave; l'&eacute;gard du
r&ocirc;le de l'&Eacute;tat. En Norv&egrave;ge, par exemple, 25
% de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale accord&eacute;e en 1991 passait
par le canal des ONG, contre 7,2% en moyenne de 1963 &agrave;
1981. Aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, le pr&eacute;sident Clinton souhaite
que l'aide dispens&eacute;e par le biais des ONG repr&eacute;sente
50% de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale totale en 1997, contre 17 en 1993
et 30 actuellement. Le Congr&egrave;s a r&eacute;cemment approuv&eacute;
cet objectif. De fa&ccedil;on plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, les
citoyens des pays industrialis&eacute;s transposent aux peuples
des pays en d&eacute;veloppement la vision id&eacute;alis&eacute;e
qu'ils ont d'eux-m&ecirc;mes : celle des bons samaritains du monde.
L'aide cibl&eacute;e est donc un m&eacute;lange de repr&eacute;sentations
occidentales et d'altruisme sinc&egrave;re.
<P>
<H3>Division des t&acirc;ches </H3>
<P>
Les politiques de lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; ne constituent
en d&eacute;finitive qu'une variation sur le th&egrave;me des
besoins fondamentaux. L'aide cibl&eacute;e revient &agrave; privil&eacute;gier
le soulagement imm&eacute;diat des pauvres, alors que l'ajustement
structurel, malgr&eacute; ses faiblesses, se pr&eacute;sente comme
la seule politique de r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute; &agrave;
long terme &eacute;labor&eacute;e par la communaut&eacute; des
donateurs. Mais un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne se profile : la division
des t&acirc;ches entre les institutions financi&egrave;res d'une
part, les autres bailleurs de fonds multilat&eacute;raux et les
donateurs bilat&eacute;raux d'autre part, et les ONG. Les premiers
seraient charg&eacute;s de cr&eacute;er un environnement &eacute;conomique
favorable &agrave; la croissance, les seconds se concentreraient
sur le mode de gouvernement et les derni&egrave;res s'occuperaient
de soulager la pauvret&eacute;. Ce sch&eacute;ma sans doute caricatural
traduit bien l'affaiblissement des oppositions id&eacute;ologiques
sur l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement amorc&eacute; &agrave; la fin
des ann&eacute;es 1970. Malheureusement, il n'y a pas lieu d'&ecirc;tre
optimiste. La faillite des th&eacute;ories &#171;universalistes&#187;
n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; combl&eacute;e par une confrontation
des politiques d'aide &agrave; la r&eacute;alit&eacute; des pays
en d&eacute;veloppement. Or tant qu'ils ne prendront pas en compte
l'environnement particulier de chaque population, les programmes
d'aide ne peuvent pas pr&eacute;tendre aller au-del&agrave; de
l'all&eacute;gement de la pauvret&eacute;, certes l&eacute;gitime,
mais d&eacute;sesp&eacute;r&eacute;ment insuffisant.

<h2>Virtual liberty</h2>

<h4>by Mark Fisher</h4>

<i>Is liberty alive in Britain?  Are our freedoms and rights real and effective?  Or do we live in a state of virtual liberty, all appearance but little substance?</i>
<hr>

Political changes in various parts of the world - Mrs Thatcher's and John Major's cutting back of the state in Britain; the rise of Newt Gingrich and the New Right in the USA; the collapse of the Left in Italy; the emergence of new democracies in eastern Europe - are forcing questions about the nature of liberty to the centre of public debate. In all these countries liberty has become a political battleground, with both Left and Right claiming to be its guardian.<p>
<p>
<center><br><i><FONT SIZE=-2>POSY SIMMONDS</FONT></i><p></center>

The classic liberal position - that both individual and collective freedoms are best secured by rights enshrined in laws, all of which have necessary limitations and restraints to ensure a balance between protective freedom and abusive licence - is being dismantled. This raises fundamental questions. What is the relationship between political and economic freedom? Or between individual and collective rights? In what respect is the state the guarantor of freedoms, or the creator of restraints? To what extent is liberty expressed in a state of mind, or in a body of laws? By what criteria should we adjudicate when different freedoms conflict? For whom should freedom exist? To think, to say and to do what? And who decides?<p>

The Right insists that social legislation, including the protection of collective and individual rights, has created neither equity nor efficiency. It claims that an individual can better exercise freedom of choice by being economically liberated through the market. This fusion of social and economic freedoms relies on a sleight of hand that uses Britain's lack of national economic success as an excuse to attack fundamental social rights, while claiming a new age of freedom from bureaucratic regulation and a rolling back of the state. Not surprisingly, the beneficiaries of this have been companies, not individuals.<p>

What is notable about this tradition is its inconsistency. Economic laissez-faire liberalism has not been matched by social libertarianism. On the contrary, economic deregulation has been accompanied by social authoritarianism. Unlike its counterpart in the USA, the British government continues to control information and maintains some of the strictest libel laws in any western democracy. It has introduced legislation restricting the 'promotion' of gay or lesbian lifestyles, established the Broadcasting Standards Council to preview and 'maintain' standards in television, and imposed a whole new range of constraints on people's lives in the new Criminal Justice Act, particularly those of squatters, travellers and demonstrators.<p>

When the CJA came into effect in February, important and ancient rights were amended or removed, most damagingly the right to assemble and the right to silence. The freedom to combine, to take secondary supportive action and to peacefully protest in industrial disputes had already been severely curtailed by the government's reforms to trade union law. The 1986 Public Order Act restricted behaviour on all types of demonstrations by making the use of 'abusive' or 'insulting' language or actions an offence whether anyone was, in practice, abused or insulted.<p>

Our immigration laws are being implemented in increasingly harsh ways: innocent people are deported, the freedom of people to come to Britain to live with their spouse, even when that person is a British citizen, is being restricted by the 'primary purpose' rule. <p>

Most shameful of all is the government's treatment of those people, subject to imprisonment or torture for their beliefs or their views in their own country, who turn to Britain for political asylum. The existence of detention centres like Campsfield and Rickmansworth, imprisoning hundreds of political refugees, is sharply at odds with the image of Britain, still common both here and abroad, as an open liberal democracy.<p>

More objective and damning evidence can be found in Britain's recent record as an infringer of human rights in the European Court in Strasbourg where no other country has as bad a record or has committed as many serious breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights as the UK: racial discrimination, interrogation methods and the Diplock courts in Northern Ireland, sex discrimination in immigration control, unlawful phone tapping, interference with prisoners' letters, the rights of mental patients. It is no coincidence that, alone among the 26 member states, Britain does not have an enforceable Bill of Rights.<p>


In a democracy there are two forms of protection against governments that are indifferent to human rights: officials prepared to blow the whistle, and media willing to publicise government excesses. After civil servants Clive Ponting and Sarah Tisdall had publicly criticised their ministerial masters in 1984, the government introduced an Official Secrets Act that denied civil servants the right to make public any abuses or mismanagement in their departments even if such disclosure was in the public interest, and reinforced this elsewhere in the public sector by means of codes of professional conduct with 'gagging clauses' that made confidentiality a condition of employment.<p>

The media have been less directly, but no less effectively, inhibited by an aggressive use of contempt of court laws under which journalists, and in 1993 the television company Channel 4, were taken to court for refusing to reveal their sources, and by the use of libel laws that frequently protect the actions of the rich and powerful from public scrutiny. At the same time, the unleashing of market forces in both the press and broadcasting has encouraged some editors and producers to give priority to profits rather than to investigative journalism.<p>

But it is too simplistic to attribute all the blame for the erosion of our liberties to an arrogant government or to constrained media. Too often we have, as a nation, sat in silence and watched as our liberties disappeared. There has been little sense of public outrage and only occasional and spasmodic protest. We have been poor guardians of our own freedoms. What happened to the tradition of dissent in Britain?<p>

But this begs a further question: would we regain a positive sense of liberty if a future government stitched together the web of rights that has been undone over the past 15 years?<p>

If liberty is fully expressed by legal guarantees and rights, then the answer must be 'yes'. But in practice, many of our freedoms depend on an individual having the power or money to exercise them. What value the legal right to clear your good name against misrepresentation or libel if you cannot cover the legal costs? What virtue in the government's freedoms of choice in health or education if the fees are beyond your means?<p>

There is another problem. Rights on the statute book and the effective means of realising them, are simply the mechanics of liberty. For a society truly to be free, it must feel itself free, it must be free in its mind. And we are not.<p>

We suffer from several peculiarly British vices: a sense of historic arrogance that breeds complacency and, above all, an over-developed and suffocating sense of deference - to those in authority, to those with money, to those with professional qualifications. It has given us stability but no sense of equality, let alone the bloody-mindedness that asserts and extends its rights. <p>

The reasons for this are buried in our history: in the continuity of land owning; in the hereditary system; in the evolutionary nature of common law; in having a ruling class that has proved sufficiently adaptable to ensure its survival; in some innate conservatism that has absorbed the sparks of political or industrial fervour - the Chartists, trades unions, the suffragettes - rather than let them catch fire; in our avoidance of a revolution. We have favoured the comforts of fairness rather than the uncertainties of freedom.<p>

This lack of collective 'attitude' inhibits us from asking some basic questions. Why are so few women in positions of power or authority? Why is there so little industrial democracy? Why do we tolerate such low levels of active participation in public life? Why are we denied basic rights such as access to all our personal records held by the state? Why, in short, do we continue to be the objects of government rather than its masters? We put these hawsers on our minds, ensuring that the rights we do have are not enjoyed in practice, trapping us in virtual liberty.<p>

We must create a new framework of rights, adding some (such as the right to freedom of information), strengthening others (such as the right to equality of opportunity and non-discrimination), restoring those that have been amended or undermined (such as the right to silence) and setting them all within a new Bill of Rights that incorporates international agreements on human rights. And we must strengthen the economy so that access to those rights that depend on money for their effectiveness is widened.<p>

But liberty, in the end, is a state of mind, not a gift of government. We have to begin to want and to value it; to demand and, when necessary, to dissent; to be bold in claiming it. Only then shall we begin to turn the shadows of virtual liberty into the substance of the thing itself.<p>

Then imagine knowing that, statistically, one of them is going to die or be disabled because of it. For women in the developing world this horrifying statistic is the reality of pregnancy and childbirth.</i></font><p><small>A pregnant woman is examined at a mother and child health clinic in Banjul, Gambia. Reducing maternal deaths will depend on the early identification of the 15 per cent of pregnancies that require modern obstetric care.&copy;UNICEF/C54-20/Carolyn Watson</small><br><center><hr width=71%><br><font size=4 color=blue>&quot;You don't needfive star hospitals&quot;</font><p><hr width=71%></center><p>This story of the unimaginable suffering of pregnancy is the centrepiece of the 1996 edition of UNICEF's &quot;<i>The Progress of Nations</i>&quot;. Revised calculations this year show that as many as 585,000 women die each year from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth - 20 per cent more than was previously thought. For the most part, these are the deaths of healthy women in the prime of their lives, vital caregivers on whom young and old depend. The 585,000 women who die every year leave behind at least a million motherless children, whose own chances of survival may be severely affected.<p>And for every woman who dies, another 30 suffer unspeakable and often untreated injuries. Perhaps the worst of these is fistula, which leaves as many as 80,000 women a year chronically incontinent. Cumulatively, between 500,000 and one million women are living with the miseries of fistula; unknown numbers commit suicide as a result.<p>If the toll of maternal death and injury is to be reduced, the first task is to break the silence that surrounds the issue. Families and communities must be taught to recognise the danger signs. And governments and aid programmes must give priority to ensuring that local hospitals and clinics can provide modern obstetric care to the 15 per cent of pregnant women at serious risk. &quot;You don't need five-star hospitals,&quot; says Deborah Maine, a leading authority in maternal health, &quot;there are thousands of hospitals that, with minimal upgrading, could provide adequate obstetric care. But many are unusable for a lack of $100 (around £60) worth of maintenance.&quot;<p>The Progress of Nations also casts a new light on one of the oldest problems of the developing world - child malnutrition. Africa is often thought to be the home of the malnourished child. But in fact, both the number and percentage of children affected by malnutrition is far higher in South Asia. Half of all the world's malnourished children are to be found in just three countries - Bangladesh, India and Pakistan - where malnutrition rates are typically twice as high as in the poor countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The difference cannot be ascribed to any significant variation in income levels or availability of food. Instead, UNICEF points the finger at far higher rates of low birth weight in South Asia, far greater population density, poorer hygiene, less satisfactory patterns of breastfeeding and weaning - and the generally lower status of Asian women.<p>Dr Monica Sharma, UNICEF's Senior Advisor in Child Health, is the author of a hard-hitting chapter in the report which documents the five preventable diseases - measles, diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia, and malnutrition - which kill as many as eight million children a year in developing countries, while children in richer countries are routinely treated and thus spared. For Dr Sharma it is &quot;as though a cure for heart disease or cancer or AIDS had been discovered but not used.&quot;<p><i>Copies of the report, which includes statistical tables ranking every country in the world according to its progress for women and children, are available from: UNICEF, Unit 1, Rignals Lane, Galleywood, Chelmsford, CM2 8TU.

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Yitzak Rabin killed by Jewish extremist</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<center><h2>Israeli prime minister Rabin <br>assassinated at peace rally</h2></center>
<p>

The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, was gunned down and killed by an extremist Jewish assassin in Tel Aviv after a peace rally on Saturday night.  <p>

As the country mourned the loss of a leader who has done more than any other to make peace with Israel's Arab neighbours, world leaders arrived for the state funeral.  Up to a million people - a fifth of the entire Israeli population - filed past the coffin as it lay in state last night.<p>

Rabin's assassin, the 25-year old law student Yigal Amir, was arrested at the scene.  He claimed that Jewish law permitted the killing of a "traitor" who was giving away parts of Israel.  "I acted alone on God's orders and I have no regrets," he said.<p>

Amir claimed that he also intended to kill the Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres, but was foiled when Peres and Rabin left the peace rally separately.  Peres has now taken over as acting Prime Minister and is expected to become leader of the Labour coalition in the Israeli parliament.<p>

The killing has blown open the widening divide between rightwingers who oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians and more moderate Jews.  While the Likud opposition has declared that it will not oppose the reconstitution of the Labour government, many extremists have expressed delight over the death of a 'traitor'.<p>

Jewish settlers on the West Bank, who are at the forefront of those opposing the Arab Israeli peace process, said they feared a backlash against them once the funeral was over.<p>

As world leaders flew in to pay their respects to Mr Rabin, one man was notable for his absence - the prime minister's fellow Nobel peace laureate and PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat.   Arafat was absent ostensibly for security reasons, and also because his presence was felt to be inappropriate in order not to further provoke Israeli hardliners.<p>

Perhaps the most fitting memory to Yitzak Rabin, the military man turned peacemaker, were his own words - spoken at the peace rally where he was killed:<p>

"This government which I have the privilege to head with my friend Shimon Peres, decided to give peace a chance; a peace which will solve most of the state of Israel's problems.<p>

"I was a military man for 27 years.  I waged war as long as there was no chance of peace.  I believe there is now a chance for peace, a great chance, and we must take advantage of it."<p>

<hr>
<p>
<B>The role of the Commonwealth in the economic and social progress of
its member states is neither widely known nor widely publicised. Yet for over
25 years the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC) has
made significant contributions to the efforts of its developing member
countries to accelerate the pace of their economic development.</b>
<p>
     The recognition by the Commonwealth that people are its greatest resource
forms the basis of its approach to development assistance - providing, in the short
term, specialist technical skills which are either not available or are in short supply
to governments to enable them to fill key positions in areas as diverse as export
and industrial promotion, high-level economic and legal services etc, and in the
longer term, a wide range of training programmes in areas that are crucial for
economic development.
<p>
     The Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation is funded by voluntary
financial contributions from member governments which, as has just been
mentioned, can also draw on it according to their needs and priorities. As a
pioneer of technical cooperation between developing countries, the Fund recruits
its experts from there and encourages South/South cooperation. It is thus not
uncommon to see West Africans serving, on short-term contracts, as legal officers
in remote Pacific island states or Sri Lankans or Indians advising on new
agricultural techniques in Africa. The Fund is administered by four separate
divisions within the Commonwealth Secretariat: the management and training
division; the general technical assistance division; the export and industrial
development division, and the economic and legal advisory services division. In
1994-95 the CFTC's financial resources stood at around  23.6 million (ECU 30m).
<p>
<h3>Human resource development</h3>
<p>
     Nearly one-third of the CFTC's budget is spent on human resource
development, helping enhance people's skills through a mix of training workshops,
study visits and individual attachments.
<p>
     Some 4000 training fellowships were awarded in 1993-95 to enhance
technical skills. These were given to middle and senior professional, technical and
administrative managers to study at some of the Commonwealth's best institutions
or to take up work attachments (63% of training takes place in less-developed
countries).
<p>
     The Fund also enables universities and other institutions to become centres
of excellence and upgrade the tuition they offer by appointing academic and
technical specialists. In 1993-95, for example, it helped five universities in Africa
and the Caribbean to run applied Masters courses through collaboration with other
Commonwealth universities.  
<p>
     As the CFTC is usually able to meet only 60% of the requests it receives
for specialised training, its programmes are held on a regional and
pan-Commonwealth basis to maximise impact, especially in topics such as
administrative reform, financial management and strategic planning.
<p>
     The Fund's training priorities include:
<ul>
<li>first and foremost, identifying needs (consultants are sent to countries to
examine their development plans and help them to prioritise training needs).
<p>
<li>providing education and training in key areas that reflect CFTC concerns such
as well-managed economic and financial reform by government, sustainable
development, participation of women and application of technology.
<p>
<li>ensuring an integrated package of consultancy, advice and training to help   
managers in government, public and private sector enterprises to coordinate and 
manage reforms and restructuring.
<p>
<li>organising policy workshops and seminars that bring together senior
government officials, executives and academics from Commonwealth countries to
pool experiences on an issue, learn examples of best practices, discuss problems
and reflect on emerging issues.
<p>
<li>giving support to institutions to offer new and specialised education and
training programmes.
<p>
<li>providing technical and vocational training under the Commonwealth Industrial
Training and Experience Programme (from 1993 to 1995, workshops were held in
hospital equipment repairs, railway repairs and maintenance and
computer-assisted manufacturing).
<p>
<li>providing training in information systems, new technologies and environmental
issues (governments are helped to develop management information systems and
apply information technology).
<p>
<li>setting up programmes for women with particular focus on entrepreneurs and
community managers (among other initiatives, the CFTC is helping three African
universities develop specialised programmes in entrepreneurship for women in
non-traditional sectors).
<p>
<li>coordinating the networking of many professional networks to facilitate
exchange of information and examples of best practices (the CFTC recently
helped to set up the Commonwealth Association for Public Administration and
Management to assist in improving public service performance and in raising
ethical standards).
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Expertise on tap</h3>
<p>
     Shortage of skills is one of the biggest stumbling-blocks facing countries
trying to raise the living standards of their people. Providing experts accounts for
about one-third of the CFTC's budget.
<p>
     Because its assistance is relatively small and carefully targeted, it avoids
the potential waste associated with larger scale projects and poor technical
planning. In 1993-95, the cost both of a typical long-term expert and an average
project was around 50 000 (ECU 62 000) a year. Experts can be in place within
three or four weeks of project approval.
<p>
     During the same period over 200 long- and short-term experts were
provided to 43 developing Commonwealth countries, six dependent territories and
18 regional organisations. The expertise requested is extremely diverse, from
hydrography and agro-forestry to tourism, statistics, legal affairs, health, social
planning and computer science.
<p>
     Assignments for short-term experts can range from a few days to six
months. Their role is advisory, helping governments to introduce new systems or
technologies. Long-term experts stay usually from six months to two years; others
may stay up to four years. Experts assist in the development and implementation
of policies or in the provision of managerial skills and the training of counterpart
staff to take over in due course. Some long-term experts are trainers in specialist
fields.
<p>
     The CFTC makes every effort to appoint women experts. In 1993-95, they
made up 13% of experts that were sent to the field. These included a consultant
anaesthetist in Ghana, an agricultural economist in Mozambique, an information
specialist in Barbados, a fisheries development officer in Papua New Guinea and
an environmental lawyer in Seychelles.
<p>
     A scheme to allow suitably qualified and experienced people to volunteer as
short-term experts for a maximum of three months was launched in mid-1995. The
scheme draws on experts from the Commonwealth who are willing to give their
services on a voluntary basis to developing countries.
<p>
<h3>Entrepreneurs come first</h3>
<p>
     In its help to small businesses, the CFTC focuses on those who manage
the businesses and identify new entrepreneurial talent. Most assistance is given to
small states, especially in the Pacific. The programme has three phases: the first
relates to 'surveys of opportunity' which is aimed at identifying suitable
entrepreneurs, investment opportunities and potential for expansion as well as
specific problems. Next comes 'workshops on entrepreneurship development'
during which business owners and operators are helped to think creatively, to
become more aware of opportunities that are available and to act strategically
when planning expansion. And the last are what we call 'business clinics' in which
one-to-one counselling is provided to an entrepreneur at his or her business. This
personal support has proved very successful in helping individual entrepreneurs to
become more efficient and competitive and, by implication, adapt to changing
world economic conditions.
<p>
<h3>Developing exports</h3>
<p>
     The CFTC has pioneered the use of Contact-Promotion programmes and
'Buyer-Seller Meets' forums to help small exporters. These forums allow company
representatives, often from small Commonwealth countries, to display their wares
and meet prospective buyers from other countries. CFTC consultants plan these
activities well ahead, shortlisting producers that are likely to succeed, identifying
suitable foreign markets and advising on redesigning of products. Sometimes
exporters and factory staff also receive training.
<p>
     The CFTC funds a special 'export development programme' for women
entrepreneurs. This includes detailed country studies of women engaged in
exporting as well as sales promotions abroad. Studies of this type have recently
been conducted in Cyprus, Sri Lanka and Zambia.
<p>
     Women are helped, under the programme, to adapt their handicrafts for
export, improve their manufacturing techniques and undertake sales missions
abroad. Training is also given in export marketing, product development, costing
and pricing. If necessary, changes to government policy are recommended. In
1994, the assistance given to Ghanaian women to develop markets for their
basketware and handicrafts is estimated to have helped generate sales worth
US$3.1 million (ECU 2.4m).

The French-speaking world and Europe:<br>convergence and
synergy?</h2>

<hr>
<p>
<b>During an international colloquium on the theme of 'The French-
speaking world and Europe', Jean-Louis Roy, General Secretary of
the ACCT (Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation), recently
stated that 'the French-speaking world is in itself no more a Euro-
pean issue than Europe is a direct concern of the French-speaking
world. Nevertheless, some Member States of the ACCT are Euro-
pean, just as some Member States of the European organisations
are French-speaking, whether one refers to the European Union, the
Council of Europe, the European Free Trade Association or the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to name but a
few. There are, consequently, common or overlapping concerns,
especially within the framework of co-operation...'</b>
<p>
     The French-speaking world and Europe are not in fact so different.
On account of their geography and history, they face similar concerns
about the countries of the South whether in Africa, the Mediterranean
Basin, the Caribbean or the Pacific. The ACCT, the only intergovern-
mental organisation of the French-speaking world, has as one of its 
vocations the exploration and highlighting of avenues of complementarity
and synergy with a view to 'making cooperation agreements work'.
<p>
<h3>Common aims</h3>
<p>
     Although the EU and the French-speaking world have followed
different paths, they nevertheless share certain aims. During the prelimi-
nary stages of its establishment, Europe saw solidarity merely in econ-
omic terms, but it swiftly realised that the cultural dimension was vital to
the achievement of its overall objectives. In contrast, the framework that
brought French-speaking countries together was, for a long time charac-
terised by its cultural &#233;lan. The need to establish common areas of
economic development was something that emerged subsequently. This
convergence of objectives based on necessity also helps to explain why
both organisations have chosen to follow a path of diversified cooper-
ation.
<p>
     It should be remembered that outside Europe, there are 30 South-
ern countries belonging to the ACCT who also enjoy close relations with
the EU enjoys close relations in the Lom&#233; Convention framework.
<p>
     As far as the Mediterranean Basin is concerned, under the Bar-
celona Declaration, Europe has recently committed itself to an approach
based on three major themes: political partnership, economic coop-
eration, and social, cultural and human issues. This involves a region
where the French-speaking community is also present, fostering close
cooperative relations in spheres such as professional training, education
and the promotion of agricultural SMEs.
<p>
     The EU is also proposing to consolidate its approach in Asia, as
exemplified in the recent Bangkok Summit. La Francophonie is already
represented there in the form of a regional office in Vietnam (Hanoi) and
a regional training centre. Indeed, the EU proposed that Vietnam be the
venue in 1997 for the Conference of heads of state and government of
countries which share French as their common language.
<p>
<h3>Useful synergistic strategies</h3>
<p>
     Given that there is so much common ground, there are undoubted-
ly opportunities for cooperation and partnership between the ACCT and
the European Commission, especially in those areas that both Europe
and the French-speaking world consider a priority.
<p>
These may be summarised as follows:
<ul>
<li> Education and training. These are sectors that have a significant corre-
lation with the level of development;
<p>
<li> Culture and communications. The experience of the ACCT in these
spheres could well be of benefit to European cooperation, in particular as
far as supporting cultural events in ACP countries is concerned;
<p>
<li> The audiovisual media. This is an area where one could easily imagine
links being forged between the ACCT fund for supporting audiovisual
production and the fund recently set up by the European Commission.
This is not to mention the support given to the media in developing countries where the French-speaking community promotes the establishment
of local rural radio stations in particular, and has started an international
French-language television channel. Such steps could usefully inspire the
ACP countries General Secretariat in an intra-ACP nations communications project;
<p>
<li> Human rights and democracy. These themes figure amongst the objectives set by the Maastricht Treaty for the EU's common security and
foreign policy, and are also an essential feature of the ACCT's work. One
of the goals here is to make the French-speaking world a place of liberty
and democracy, with actions aimed at upholding the rule of law, ensuring
justice and promoting human rights;
<p>
<li> The global environment. Again, closer coordination between the ACP
states, the EU and the French-speaking world could prove useful in
strengthening environmental measures;
<p>
<li> Women and development. This may appear as a tangential issue, but it
is a subject of increasing concern. The ACCT, through the multidisciplinary nature of its interventions, could make a significant contribution
to discussions on the role of women from ACP countries within a changing socio-cultural environment.
</ul><p>
     In conclusion, even if the financial and legal resources of the
ACCT do not quite match those of the European institutions, the former
nevertheless has a wealth of experience, and an assortment of methods
and networks at its disposal which place it in a good position to propose
useful synergistic strategies ranging from co-financing to co-implementation, via a technical partnership.
<p>
     It was with this in mind that, during the Cotonou Summit in 1995,
the heads of state and government of French-speaking nations adopted a
resolution giving the ACCT a mandate to embark on negotiations with the
European institutions on their behalf. One result of this has been the
opening of an ACCT liaison office in Brussels to serve as an interface
with the EC institutions and the ACP Secretariat.
<p>
     Far from being an obstacle to finding common ground, the differences in institutional options - the supranational model for Europe and
the intergovernmental multilateral model for the French-speaking world -
could form the basis of a mutually beneficial synergistic relationship
between the two groups. Indeed, it could be said that while still following
individual paths, the French-speaking world and Europe can both gain by
coming together at a crossroads, in the interests of cooperative develop-
ment.
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<td>
<center>A Common identity for the French-speaking world</center>
<p>
Born of the wish to unite all countries with French as their shared language under an umbrella of common projects, La Francophonie constitutes a meeting point between Africa, America, Asia, Europe, the Maghreb, the Mashreq and Oceania. It forms a multifaceted and united community that respects the ethnic and cultural differences of each partner
and has a role to play in global discussions.
<p>
The political structures
<ul>
<li>Conference of Heads of State and Government (Francophonie Summit)
<li>Francophonie Ministerial Conference (Foreign Affairs Ministers)
<li>Permanent Council (co-ordination of the activities of the French-speaking Community)
<li>Sector-based Ministerial Conferences
<li>Advisory Assembly</ul>
<p>
The intergovernmental organisation
<p>
Set up in Niamey in 1970, the Agency for Cultural and Technical Co-operation (ACCT) is the sole intergovernmental organisation set up by
the French-speaking nations, and it takes the lead role in organising
Francophonie Summits.
<p>
It acts as the secretariat for all Francophonie authorities and is active in
the spheres of education and training, culture and the media, legal
cooperation and various specific initiatives within its development and
solidarity programme.
<p>
The ACCT headquarters is in Paris. It also has regional offices in
Lom&#233;, Libreville and Hanoi, and liaison offices for the United
Nations in New York and Geneva, and for the European institutions and
ACP Secretariat in Brussels.
<p>
The specialised operators
<ul>
<li>AUPELF (Association of wholly or partly French-speaking universities)
: higher education and research
<li>TV5 : multilateral French-language television channel
<li>Universit&#233; Senghor d'Alexandrie : senior management training
programmes
<li>AIMF (International association of French-speaking mayors) :
decentralised co-operation.</ul>

Joint Assembly: Sparks fly in Namibia</h2>
<h4>by <i>Dorothy Morrissey</i>
<p>

<hr>
<p>
<B>Sparks were flying in Windhoek during the week of 18-22 March,
and not just for the sixth anniversary celebrations of Namibia's
independence! The 22nd session of the ACP/EU Joint Assembly was
marked by heated political discussion - notably on human rights
issues - dispelling the notion that this body is nothing more
than a diplomatic 'talking shop'. Uniquely, the session culminated
in secret ballots on resolutions relating to Nigeria, Niger and
Sudan.</B>
<P>
 It was a week where the emphasis was on putting words into action.
The tone was set by ACP co-President,<I> Sir John Kaputin</I>
(Papua New Guinea), in his opening statement, with some hard-hitting
comments on the urgent problems confronting the ACP-EU partnership.
Speaking of the recent Lom&eacute; mid-term review, he said that
the relationship on which it was based appeared to be dwindling,
and that it faced a very uncertain future after the year 2000.
He feared that Europe was turning increasingly to its neighbours
in Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, and called
for a summit of ACP leaders to find ways of safeguarding the existing
cooperation. He went on to comment on his recent fact-finding
mission to Rwanda and Burundi as part of a Joint Assembly delegation
- and on the shocking reality of what he saw. He dubbed the situation
there as 'the world's failure to learn from the past', arguing
that existing arrangements for dealing with crises were inadequate.
Little of the aid that was promised got through, he suggested,
and what does get through has a limited impact.
<P>
 Sir John also spoke of the situation in Niger, relaying the 'anxiety
felt by the ACP group on hearing of the decision by the EU to
suspend its cooperation with Niger only 48 hours after the coup
and without holding any consultations.' He appealed to the EU
to follow the procedure which now exists defining steps to be
taken before cooperation can be suspended. Finally, he spoke of
the need to do very much more in the area of South-South cooperation,
where, he said 'words run well ahead of action.'
<P>
 The address of European co-President<I>, Lord Plumb</I>, tended,
on the other hand, to focus on the positive aspects of Lom&eacute;.
Lord Plumb argued that it represented a 'real partnership' and
that many Europeans 'do not realise just how warm is the relationship
between the EU and the countries of the South'. He stressed that
the promises contained in the Convention should be delivered.
<P>
 Welcoming the initiative by SADC to set up a parliamentary forum,
he compared this with the beginnings of the European Parliament.
In Southern Africa, he said, 'hopes are running high for economic
recovery'. Lord Plumb also welcomed South Africa's delegation
to the Assembly - there as observers for probably the last time
before becoming 'full' members. He acknowledged that the current
EU-South Africa negotiations were proving difficult 'given the
reticence of one or two countries', but he thought that agreement
was very close. He went on to stress the importance of ensuring
that all countries in the region benefited from South Africa's
link with the EU.
<P>
 On the question of human rights, Lord Plumb noted that there
were areas in Africa where the situation was particularly worrying.
He spoke of the shock that had been felt at events in Nigeria
- particularly the execution of Ken Sara Wiwa and other Ogoni
activists.  'It is my sincere hope', he  said, 'that Nigeria will
return in the shortest possible time... to a free and open system
of government with an elected civilian President, and a Parliament
with political parties that can send members to our Assembly.'
In a different vein, the co-President pointed out that in 1994,
the EU had contributed $29 billion in official development assistance
- more than half the global total of $57 billion. By contrast,
the USA had given less than $10 billion and a high proportion
of this went to just two countries, Israel and Egypt. As Lord
Plumb observed, 'much of this is for purposes we would not necessarily
regard as purely developmental.'
<P>
 In a welcoming address, President <I>Sam Nujoma</I> of Namibia
expressed his delight that the Assembly was taking place in Windhoek
at a time when his country was celebrating its sixth year of independence.
This independence was achieved, he stressed, with the support
of international solidarity. And he suggested that while negotiations
to review Lom&eacute; IV had been difficult, both sides had emerged
'triumphant.' He pleaded for the Lom&eacute; spirit of cooperation
to be jealously guarded. He went on to acknowledge that the picture
emerging from recent Joint Assembly resolutions and reports revealed
an increasingly troubled world, with many people in Africa experiencing
hardship because of war, hunger and disease. Nonetheless, he argued
that 'our greatest strength will be the express political will
to stay and work together.'
<P>
 The EC's Development Commissioner, Professor <I>Jo&atilde;o de
Deus Pinheiro</I>, used his opening statement to focus on the
'solid achievements' of the Convention. One important example
was the Assembly itself, which he described as 'a place for dialogue,
debate and consultation to promote greater understanding between
our peoples'. He emphasised the need to support  sustainable development
in developing countries, as one of the fundamental aims of the
EU's cooperation policy. As for the future, Professor Pinheiro
said that discussions needed to be launched before, and independently
of, the Commission's institutional obligation to do so. He indicated
that the Commission would be publishing a Green Paper on the subject
of future cooperation by the autumn of 1996. This document, he
said, would 'set out questions and options, but would stop short
of making formal proposals.'
<P>
<B>The future of Lom&eacute;</B>
<P>
 Opening the debate on future ACP-EU relations, general rapporteur
<I>Jean-Louis Firmin</I> (Haiti) highlighted the cornerstones
of the Lom&eacute; Convention, stating that it was a framework
for North-South cooperation, embodying the principals of solidarity
and equal partnership. He was firm on the need to keep this partnership
alive, especially in times of uncertainty and instability. 'Links
established over many years can't be thrown aside', he insisted.
He went on to deliver a hard-hitting assessment of the problems
affecting the Lom&eacute; system, noting, for example, that Stabex
and Sysmin had not achieved the desired results, and that the
ACPs' debt burden had increased. 'In some ways,' he suggested,
'the situation is worse than 20 years ago.'
<P>
 Mr Firmin thought it vital to attract European investment to
ACP industries, stressing the importance of involving local communities
and women in the process. He was particularly concerned that the
EU's Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) would view development
solely in the broader context of the external relations policy.
The goal, he thought, should be to have the commitment to Lom&eacute;
reaffirmed in the IGC with the EDF being entrenched in the final
agreement.
<P>
 From the exchange of views that followed, the general consensus
was that the Convention should continue in some form. Much concern
was voiced on the subject of aid. <I>Glenys Kinnock</I> (PES-UK)
pointed out that resources provided in the revised Lom&eacute;
Convention had remained static. She was particularly critical
of what she saw as the Commission's emphasis on Indonesia. In
this connection, she suggested, 'the EU's economic interests override
any other priorities we might discuss today'. <I>John Corrie</I>
(PPE-UK) echoed this when he accused the EU of hypocrisy in demanding
good governance and respect for human rights in ACP countries.
He noted that no such demands were made in relations with Indonesia,
which is one of the EU's major trading partners. The MEP argued
that such double standards should end. It was sad to note, in
addition, that aid to Eastern Europe had increased by 50%, while
aid was being cut to the ACPs, some of whom were 'drowning in
a sea of debt'. Referring to the mid-term review, <I>Zambia's</I>
representative said there had been 'a sleight of hand to disguise
the fact that money is running out'.
<P>
 Concern was also expressed about the public's perception of aid.
According to <I>Helena Torres Couto</I>, (PES-P) people should
be made more aware of the advantages of cooperation, and should
be shown how resources are used. A serious worldwide policy was
needed, she suggested, to win the battle of public opinion.
<P>
<I> Mr Incisa di Camerana</I>, the Italian President-in-office
of the EU Council spoke in his presentation of the need for the
Convention to adapt to a changing world. He argued that the increase
in Lom&eacute; aid provision to more than ECU 13.5bn showed the
priority that the EU attaches to ACP-EU cooperation. It should,
he felt, reassure the ACP countries that Europe was not turning
away from them.  The President-in-office of the ACP Council, <I>Z&eacute;phirin
Diabre</I>, made a pressing appeal to ACP countries to give priority
to trade, highlighting the deterioration in their trade results.
<P>
<B>Nigeria</B>
<P>
<I> Ayo Agunlade</I>, Nigeria's Planning Minister, gave a speech
outlining the steps he said were being taken to put his country
on the path to democracy. The EU's decision unilaterally to impose
sanctions, without giving Nigeria a hearing, was not in a spirit
of dialogue, he argued. Visa restrictions and sports boycotts
would achieve nothing. Instead, there was a need to move forward
to understanding, cooperation and support for his 'beleaguered'
country. 'We believe in dialogue,' he proclaimed. 'Let us shake
hands.' He concluded by quoting Martin Luther King: 'We are not
what we ought to be, we are not what we wish to be, we are not
what we hope to be, but we are not what we used to be'.
<P>
 But his remarks did not win over Glenys Kinnock, who reminded
him that he had made no reference to Ken Saro Wiwa and the other
Ogoni environmentalists, executed after a military tribunal, despite
the many appeals for clemency. Nigeria appeared aggrieved by the
attitude of the international community, she said, but she assumed
that the families of those executed also felt aggrieved. In Mrs
Kinnock's opinion, sanctions have had little effect, and 'the
world has been pusillanimous and cowardly in its approach.' Appeasement
would never work, she insisted, and the only way to effect change
was through an oil embargo.
<P>
 The representative of <I>Ghana</I> said that mistakes had been
made, but he favoured diplomacy rather than a 'retaliatory approach',
and called for a joint mission to Nigeria to report on the situation.
This was echoed later by speakers from <I>Senegal</I> and <I>Guinea</I>.
<I>Johanna Maij-Weggen</I> (NL-EPP) noted that voting on a resolution
had been postponed at the last Assembly, following assurances
from Nigeria that the situation was improving.
<P>
 The political temperature of the Assembly rose sharply when the
Barbados representative, expressing outrage at the executions,
criticised the ACP draft resolution that had been drawn up as
'a retreat from principles to which we are all committed'. This
drew a sharp riposte from the <I>Ugandan </I>speaker who accused
the Barbados delegate of being 'a product of history that we are
not very proud of.' This prompted <I>Ethiopia's</I> representative
to spring to the defence of Barbados. 'We should take our hats
off' to this country, he said, 'which has had 350 years of uninterrupted
democracy.' Uganda's speaker later expressed 'deep regret' for
his remark, saying that it had been made during 'one of the most
heated and acrimonious debates we have ever had in the Assembly.'
<P>
 The representative from <I>C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire</I> argued that
an appeal should be made to the multinationals, who had played
a role in the events in Nigeria. The speaker from Zambia pointed
out that the fault line was not between the ACP and EU on this
issue, but rather, within the ACP Group itself and also reiterated
the call for a mission to be sent to Nigeria.
<P>
 In reply, Mr Ayunlade said that the Nigeria's objection to a
mission was based on principle. He believed that EU should have
asked questions before and not after suspending cooperation. Lord
Plumb indicated that he had written to the President of Nigeria
on this subject last September but was still awaiting a reply.
<P>
 At the voting at the end of the week, the Assembly took the unprecedented
decision to hold a secret ballot for resolutions where the issue
was contentious, or where there was clearly a difference of opinion.
The Nigerian representative argued that this was discriminatory,
and indicated that his country would consider pulling out of the
Convention. They also requested a split vote  (Europeans and ACP
voting as separate groups, with a majority required in both groups).
Two resolutions relating to Nigeria were voted on. The one tabled
by the European side was adopted. This condemned Nigeria for the
'brutal execution' of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights
activists and called for immediate restoration of democratic institutions,
the release of Mr Abiola and all other political prisoners, the
appointment of a UN rapporteur to investigate human rights abuses,
and a total retrospective ban on EU arms exports to Nigeria. It
also called on the Commission and Council to consider an oil embargo.
The ACP resolution, which noted 'that there appear to be real
moves in the direction of democracy and civil rule in Nigeria',
and called for a mission to be sent 'to observe and report', was
rejected.
<P>
<B>Industrial development</B>
<P>
 The Assembly may have been dominated by discussions over the
future of ACP-EU cooperation and the situation in Nigeria, but
members also found time to adopt two major resolutions. The first
of these accompanied a  report drawn up by <I>J.K.Swartz</I> (Botswana)
on industrial development under the fourth Lom&eacute; Convention.
This proposes promoting diversified industrial development, based
on the market economy and privatisation. It was agreed that financial
contributions to ACP countries can only act as a stimulus for
home-grown initiatives. The rapporteur noted that ACP countries
lag behind in terms of industrial development. With 9% of the
world's population, they are responsible for just 0.4% world industrial
production. He also referred to the high debt levels, particularly
in Africa, and the vulnerability of ACP economies to market turbulence.
At the same time, he acknowledged that there were a number of
self-inflicted problems, such as hostility to investment, bad
governance and corruption. Mr Swartz thought that an effort needed
to be made to change the investment climate, with improved market
access and the development of infrastructure.
<P>
 The rapporteur was also critical of the tendency to concentrate
on negative issues instead of praising countries that had done
well. He reserved particular praise for the Centre for Development
of Industry (CDI), which he said played an important role, although
it could be even more effective if additional  resources were
allocated.
<P>
 Speaking for the Commission, <I>Steffen Smidt</I>, the Director-General
for Development, congratulated Mr Swartz on his report and said
that he regarded the private sector as one of the best tools available
to the ACP countries for achieving sustainable development. Despite
this, only a small number of ACP states had chosen the private
sector as a 'sector of concentration'. He pointed out that the
Convention talks of promoting economic development through industrialisation
and private sector development, thus generating jobs, income,
wealth and essential products.
<P>
<B>Refugees</B>
<P>
 Also adopted at the Windhoek Assembly was a report by <I>Luciano
Vecchi</I> (PES-I) on the situation of refugees in ACP countries.
This is one of the most acute international problems, with approximately
27 million refugees and a similar number of displaced persons
in the world. In Africa, the number has increased dramatically
since 1990. There are some grounds for hope - between 1991 and
1994 about 9 million people were able to return to their home
countries.
<P>
 The report calls for a full-scale review of policy concerning
refugees and displaced persons, with the submission of a report
in one year. It urges the ACP-EU Council of Ministers to recognise
that existing provisions are inadequate given the scale of the
crisis, and stresses that the problem can only be resolved at
regional level. It further calls on the ACP and EU states to renew
their efforts in the area of prevention, and makes a plea for
speedier decision-making and resource allocation procedures in
the Commission. Finally, it expresses alarm at the environmental
damage caused by population displacement, and urges donors to
provide more funding for environmental rehabilitation. Mr Vecchi
stressed that the report should not be read as a criticism of
the EU, which is the biggest international donor. It should be
viewed rather as a contribution to a joint effort to review policy.
<P>
 During the debate, representatives from <I>Ghana</I> and <I>Kenya</I>
emphasised the burden placed on the host countries, who are often
themselves impoverished. The Kenyan speaker drew particular attention
to the security issue pointing out that refugees often come arrive
in their 'host' country with weapons. He called for a halt on
the flow of arms to conflict areas, pointing out that there are
no armaments factories in Africa. Others identified poverty as
the root problem which lay behind many refugee situations: the
resources available were quite simply insufficient to share out
amongst different ethnic groups in a given area, and the result
of this was often conflict and displacement. The Ugandan representative
spoke of the responsibility to create socio-economic conditions
suitable for refugees to return home. Another serious problem
mitigating against the return of refugees was the widespread use
of anti-personnel mines. These posed a threat to returnees in
many places.

<B>Round up of the situation in specific ACP countries</B>
<P>
As usual, the Joint Assembly held a series of mini-debates focusing
on the current situation in a number of ACP countries. Some of
the key points raised are summarised below:
<P>
<B>Rwanda</B> <B>and Burundi</B>
<P>
The social, political and security situation in Burundi has not
yet been normalised, and the Assembly adopted a resolution condemning
continued acts of violence and calling on the Government and the
international community to increase their efforts to stabilise
the situation.
<P>
There is an urgent need to assist in the reconstruction of Rwanda,
with prison conditions and the fate of refugees giving particular
cause for concern. A resolution was adopted calling on the Rwandan
government and the ACP-EU countries to take all measures necessary
to restore a climate of peace and stability.
<P>
<B>Niger</B>
<P>
The Haiti representative reported on the Joint Assembly mission
to this country. He called on the EU to assist Niger in re-establishing
the rule of law. The C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire representative expressed
concern at the 'way in which the EU rushed into punishing Niger
without hearing their side.' The speaker from Madagascar said
that the coup should not be condemned out of hand, and that an
emergency situation had existed. The Commission pointed out its
intention to continue humanitarian aid.
<P>
<B>Somalia</B>
<P>
While there are areas of relative calm where rehabilitation is
taking place, the overall situation in Somalia is dismal, noted
Luciano Vecchi (rapporteur for the Joint Assembly mission to Kenya,
Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea). He said that Somalia has not had
a functioning government for five years, and spoke of the need
to find a political and legal solution to allow it to ratify the
Lom&eacute; Convention and apply for EDF funds. There is also
a serious problem of returning refugees, many of whom are dying
of hunger. He welcomed the efforts of the OAU to bring about peace,
and praised the courageous decision of many NGOs to stay in Somalia.
For the Commission, <I>Mr Theodorakis</I> (Deputy Director-General)
said that they were working on a proposal for an ECU 47m aid programme.
<P>
<B>Sudan </B>
<P>
Strong words were exchanged on this subject, with the Ugandan
representative accusing Sudan of disrupting their general election,
re-arming terrorists who carry out attacks in Uganda, and being
determined to push Islam in the region. In reply, the Sudanese
speaker accused Uganda of supplying equipment to the rebel movement.The
Ethiopian representative noted that Sudan was in conflict with
most of its neighbours and is condemned internationally. He called
on the Sudanese government to extradite three alleged terrorists
said to be hiding there. Finally, arguing that the situation had
not improved, <I>Ernesto Caccavale</I> (FE-I) advocated Sudan's
expulsion from the Lom&eacute; Convention.

<h3>ELECTRIC JOLT FOR THE CAR INDUSTRY</h3>
<i>
The World Bank is urging developing countries to convert to lead-free petrol 
in order to curb the damaging health effects of car emissions, and 
industrialised countries are increasingly pressing vehicle manufacturers to 
reduce pollution. The moves ought to leave a clear field for electric cars, 
reports <b>Gemini News Service</b>, but the reality is not that simple.<p>


By <b>MICK HAMER</b>,<br>
28 May 1996,<br>
London  </i><hr><p>


        The moment may have finally arrived for the electric car - although it 
is not about to take over the market.<p>

        California's powerful air resources board - which led the 
industrialised world into the now standard use of catalytic converters on car 
exhausts - has set its sights on introducing cars that produce no pollution at 
all.<p>

        The state wants two per cent of the cars in the showroom to be 
zero-emission by 1998, rising to 10 per cent by 2003. <p>

        Effectively, zero-emission vehicles have to be electric cars. It is 
the only technology that produces no emissions at all. <p>

        A dozen other US states are also demanding the introduction of 
electric vehicles. So is Europe. In Britain alone, pollution from particles 
produced by diesel vehicles leads to thousands of premature deaths from 
breathing disorders every year.<p>

        To help combat this pollution, the European Commission has set up a 
"car of tomorrow" task force. Competition Commissioner Martin Bangemann says: <p>

"It is necessary to pursue the goal of vehicles with ultra-low emissions 
extending to zero-emission options."<p>

        But will electric cars ever outsell petrol and diesel models? A 
hundred years ago, electric propulsion seemed to have a bright future. The 
first car to exceed 100 kilometres an hour was electric. In the first years of 
this century electric cars were outselling petrol by two-to-one in the United 
States. <p>

        In the subsequent 80 years, the technology of the electric vehicle 
stood still, while the petrol car has become steadily more reliable. If the 
electric car is to have a future, a lot depends on the success of the stance 
taken by California and a dozen north-eastern states.<p>

        Already, the big three US car-makers - Ford, Chrysler and General 
Motors -  have launched a sustained lobbying campaign designed to persuade 
California to scale down its demands.<p>

        They argue that electric cars cannot match the performance of petrol 
cars, and that without a technological breakthrough, electric cars will simply 
stay in the showrooms. The public will not buy them.<p>

        The key technological problem is the electric car's battery. The 
lead-acid battery has remained unchanged for a century. It is the same battery 
that petrol cars use to operate the electric starter-motor. It is heavy and has 
only a low power output. And in an electric car, a sizeable chunk of the 
battery's power is wasted on moving the weight of the battery.<p>

        The result is that an electric car's range is limited. A petrol car 
can run more than 300 miles on a single tank of fuel. An electric car has a 
range of around 60 miles.<p>

        Despite this limitation, many people believe that electric cars have a 
future as an urban run-around.<p>

        Brian Roden, of Britain's Electric Vehicle Association, argues that 
there is a problem of perception. In Britain, fewer than 20 per cent of 
journeys are longer than 10 miles. Only five per cent are longer than 25 miles.<p>

        Roden says people could use electric cars for all their normal 
journeys around town - thus easing pollution in the areas where it is worst - 
and hire a petrol car when they want to make a longer journey.<p>

        Despite the electric car's limitations, one manufacturer is producing 
a commercial model: the French firm Peugeot's electric version of its 106 
model. It currently makes about 200 a month, but because of the low production 
run, the electric version is about a third more expensive than the petrol model.<p>

        At the moment, says Roden, his association is concentrating on trying 
to persuade local councils to buy electric vehicles. A lot of council services 
that involve deliveries, such as "meals on wheels" for the home-bound, could 
easily be carried out with electric vehicles.<p>

        But in the short term, the electric vehicle's prospects are modest. 
Roden says that if manufacturers got an order for 20, "we'd be pleased. An 
order for 200 would be a real challenge. An order for 2,000 would be 
embarrassing - we couldn't do it." <p>

<B>1989 saw the end of the Yalta-inspired twin-superpower
dominance. Nations had to examine their priorities in their desire for
integration in an international environment in which geostrategic
and economic realignment would be unavoidable. The philosophy
which had served as a basis and reference point for North/South
relations throughout the Cold War period is now being called into
question and necessary adjustments in ideas have been
triggered.</b>
<p>
     The Lom&#233; Convention, which governs the development-
cooperation relationship between the EU and the 70 ACP countries, is a
unique North/South cooperation agreement on account of its contractual
nature, its durability, the funds it allocates and the fact that it provides for
a permanent dialogue. But it is also now at a decisive point in its history.
<p>
     Those who regard the Convention as out-of-date and in need of
renovation, and those more radical critics who believe that it no longer
serves any useful purpose and must be phased out, both argue that a
new direction is needed.
<p>
     Beyond all the criticism formulated against this system, the
fundamental question remains as to whether the Lom&#233; Convention
will be able, given the necessary changes, to carry on after its fourth
version reaches its term.
<p>
     The years between now and the end of the century will, naturally,
see the application of the revised Lom&#233; IV, including the substantial
improvements made to it. However, this same period must also be used
to prepare the ground for ACP/EU development cooperation in the future,
whatever form it might take.
<p>
     Shortly after his nomination as European Commissioner for
relations with the ACP countries and South Africa, Professor Pinheiro
commented, realistically, that the ACP countries are not "in fashion". The
change of emphasis can be seen clearly if one looks at the EU's
burgeoning relations with its eastern neighbours from the former
Communist bloc (illustrated by the wide range of European programmes
now benefiting these countries). One might also cite the strengthening of
ties with countries in the Mediterranean basin. Economic and security
concerns underpin this development, but it undoubtedly reduces the
significance which was once accorded to the ACP states.
<p>
     Moreover, the economic objectives of virtually all EU countries, as
they seek to reduce budget deficits and deal with increasing internal
social problems inevitably put pressure on the amount of development
aid being granted to the Third-World.
<p>
     This situation is, of course, not restricted to the European Union -
which in fact remains the world's main contributor of official development
aid. At the instigation of a Republican-dominated Congress, the United
States is planning much more swingeing cuts in its contribution, both to
certain international agencies and to certain regions (including Africa).
<p>
     This undeniable cutback in public development aid has been offset
in recent years by net increases in private capital flows, but the
geographical distribution is highly skewed. Only a few of the poorest
developing countries have benefited from the trend, the main "winners"
being the emerging states of Asia. These include countries such as
China, India and Indonesia which, it is worth noting in passing, do not
have particularly good human rights records, in the sense that the term is
understood in Europe. Despite the fact that ACP countries have identified
potential for attracting foreign investment, they have not actually
benefited from this change in resource flows.
<p>
     In this climate, with official development aid in increasingly short
supply, innovative methods for making optimum use of the available
resources must be devised within the context of the Lom&#233;
Convention.
<p>
     On current indications, it is quite possible that in the year 2000,
the Lom&#233; Convention will be filed away in the archives. ACP/EU
relations will certainly have to be more in step with recent developments
on the international scene. The initial reasons for the establishment of a
cooperative relationship between Europe and the ACPs, following the
signature of the Rome Treaty, are now outmoded. As Paul Val&#233;ry
has commented: 'One of the worst mental aberrations is to think that
things can survive when the reasons for their existence have gone'.
<p>
     So, what type of development cooperation should the countries of
the European Union and their ACP partners aim for in the future?
<p>
<h3>Alternative trends </h3>
<p>
     The EU has stated that it is in favour of a globalisation of aid
within an innovative framework. One of the first questions to be asked is
whether uniform cooperation with regions whose monolithic character is
being increasingly called into question is still desirable. Variable
geometry in development-cooperation relations is increasingly being seen
as the trend to be followed.
<p>
     If this option is chosen, there is a risk of the following scenario
being created: The EU's relationship with the Caribbean could become
diluted within its relationship with Latin-American countries and links with
the Pacific countries could become confused with economic relations with
Asia. What would then become of Africa, the continent needing most
attention on account of the wide range of its difficulties and its increasing
marginalisation?
<p>
     In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly, aware of the
African question, adopted a new agenda on development in Africa, thus
making that continent its number-one priority. Europe, on the other hand,
must not simply focus on Africa but must invent new modes of action
which are more concrete and more effective.
<p>
     Secondly, recent trends imply greater conditionality. This has been
taken on board not just by EU Member States. A number of multilateral
aid agencies have also included it in their strategy. The OECD's
Development Aid Committee believes that future relationships between
North and South will be greatly influenced by conditionality and, indeed,
the Organisation goes so far as to advocate this approach.
<p>
     However, conditionality in terms of development is a strategic
element which must be handled with extreme caution. If cooperation,
whether today or in the future, is to be based on conditionality, then it
can only be rendered effective if aid recipients (both governments and
the governed) are genuinely committed to the idea. They must be
convinced, in a climate of resource-scarcity, than the approach is
motivated by a desire for greater success.
<p>
     The European Union thus has a vital role to play, making full use
of its advantages in terms of dialogue and consultation in order to
prevent conditionality being perceived as a condescending mechanism.
Thereby, it can help to prevent conditionality from generating the well-
known perverse effects of "tied" aid.
<p>
     Of course, conditionality raises the thorny question of national
sovereignty, but it is important to observe that modern international
relations have moved on, both de jure and de facto, from a concept of
absolute sovereignty to one of relative sovereignty. This is illustrated by
the trend towards humanitarian intervention as a right, the requirements
of the Bretton Woods institutions, supranationality in certain regional
international organisations, and the very fact of world economic
interdependence.
<p>
     This does not mean that the developing states should sell off their
sovereignty to the highest bidder but that conditionality should be the
subject of negotiation. Donors must be more flexible in their demands
and thereby give the country in question such room to manoeuvre as is
necessary for programmes to succeed.
<p>
     Thirdly, development of the private sector appears now to be
approved by all parties. Since independence, the State has been
omnipresent and omnipotent in most productive areas of ACP
economies. Given the failures of the public sector, private enterprise is
now being called in to help. Its development is one of the sector-specific
policies which will and must receive most support.
<p>
     The development of the private sector must permit better
distribution of the fruits of growth and promote integration of the ACP
countries into the market economy. There can be no question of pitting
private enterprise against the public sector, because any Manichean
approach in this sphere might prove to be risky. It is important also to
stress that free market development cannot take place overnight and that
it is subject to inescapable macro- and microeconomic preconditions.
<p>
     Indeed, the birth and expansion of a dynamic private sector
depends on the politico-economic fabric. This include reliable financial
bodies, functioning financial intermediation, adequate infrastructures,
technical qualifications and training, a suitable legal/regulatory
framework, institutions to support private businesses, the channelling of
the informal sector and a public sector which is prepared to play fair,
aware of its regulatory role. These, in short, are the necessary
ingredients for the adjustment of the private sector to permit the
development of a true enterprise culture.
<p>
     The development of a harmonious private sector will make it
possible more easily to achieve the transformation and export objectives
required by international competitiveness. It should, therefore, help to
counteract the erosion of commercial preferences generated by the
Uruguay Round. The latter's time limits should, in any case, be extended,
because it seems clear that the ACP countries will be unable to fulfil their
obligations by the end of the moratorium obtained by the EU during the
negotiations.
<p>
     The notion of compensating for inequality that is found in
international development law, implies the adoption of a normative
system to counteract the weak trading position of developing countries
vis-a-vis their competitors in the North. But in recent times, this idea has
been losing ground and it is unlikely to cut much ice with the WTO
authorities. Legal equality in a situation where there is structural
inequality is not, in fact, equitable, and it is therefore necessary to find
some other way of mitigating the adverse effects, looking at it in a global
context.
<p>
     Promotion of domestic and foreign investment should be better
supported. People talk of the "risk/country" threshold that deters  foreign
investors. It may be that this can be measured objectively by looking at
economic and other indicators, but even if this is not possible, it clearly
exists as a psychological barrier. This is a problem for many ACP
countries and it needs to be crossed, using measures which tackle the
many obstacles to investment.
<p>
<h3>Changing the culture of development
cooperation</h3>
<p>
     Besides all the technical aspects, one could argue that the
shortcomings of the Lom&#233; Convention stem also from the
perceptions of those involved in development cooperation. In short, it is
the actual concept and culture of development aid which must be
changed. 
<p>
     On the European side, the colonial legacy has conditioned
attitudes, imprinting on them a dominant paternalism which is prejudicial
to the aim of development. This European concept of cooperation must
be overturned. Moreover, development cooperation must not be seen as
the art of the possible but as the art of making possible what is strictly
necessary, by virtue of genuine negotiation with the countries which have
resolved to move forward.
<p>
     Moreover, it is desirable to have a better developed policy of
informing European public opinion about development cooperation.  An
effort is needed to counter false impressions, such as the one left by the
French journalist who wrote: 'Official development aid is like taking
money from the poor in rich countries to give it to the rich in poor
countries'. Better information is needed to ensure that the public can
decide such matters for itself.
<p>
     Coordinating the Union's policies with those of the Member States
now presents an enormous challenge. The political obstacles are huge
and development cooperation may well suffer as a result of them if the
objectives of coordination, coherence and complementarity contained in
the Maastricht Treaty are not achieved.
<p>
     As for the ACP countries, success in their economic development
depends on many factors, cooperation being only one of them. Many
political leaders in these nations have too often described cooperation
with the North as the only way in which they can develop. In fact, this
should be seen as nothing more than an additional factor -  supporting
the national effort and a genuine desire for development. It is pure
fantasy to believe that development can be set in motion solely on the
basis of an external impetus. This is why future cooperation between the
EU and the ACP countries must progress towards reinforcing the aptitude
of the latter to devise, master and control their own development
process.
<p>
     In the future, the ACP countries must propose concrete and
responsible solutions to their partners, doing so by means of the dialogue
system. They must also promote development based on participation,
particularly with the involvement of young people and women.
<p>
     The fact that the ACPs can offer a credible prospectus for
development must be acknowledged. It is undoubtedly a challenge but it
can successfully be overcome if a climate of stability, security and
confidence is created, matched by an unambiguous political will.
<p>
     In EU/ACP relations, programmes must include the long-term
vision necessary for sustainable development. Too often in the past, the
strategy has been aimed at an immediate and ostentatious result.
Successful development in the future will depend crucially on a change in
such attitudes.

<b>
Planned long before the Lom&#233; IV review process got under way, the Coastal Communes programme in C&#244;te d'Ivoire may well serve as a test case for the concept of decentralisation as incorporated into the revised Convention.</b>
<p>
	Decentralisation is a policy of the Ivorian government, which is supported by the European Union and is reflected in the national indicative programme. It aims not only at ensuring a better economic balance between the capital, Abidjan, and provincial towns - thereby reducing migration pressures on the former - but also at maximizing the latter's contribution to national development. Indeed, decentralisation in this West African country is believed to have already reached a level that would enable the people of the communes to take effective control over their own economic destiny, assuming they are provided with the necessary infrastructures and inputs.
<p>
<h3>258 projects in all</h3>

	The Coastal Communes programme was conceived in 1991. It concentrates on the 16 coastal districts of the country which, taken together have a population of nearly half a million. In the past, these areas benefited least from public expenditure and they are the hardest hit in the current economic crisis. The programme aims to redress the situation somewhat through a variety of physical and non-physical projects - 258 in all - encompassing rehabilitation of existing infrastructures and the construction of new ones in a number of fields including sanitation, drinking water supply, health, roads and markets. It also includes the provision of equipment, studies, training and technical assistance. The total cost is put at ECU 30m of which ECU 28m is being provided by the European Development Fund.
<p>
	The programme has three broad objectives. The first is to improve living conditions in the urban areas; reducing the economic costs of sickness and ignorance, and ensuring that the urban economy functions more efficiently. The second is to increase the planning, administrative and investment capabilities of the communes. This involves strengthening their treasuries by teaching them how to collect state revenues allocated to them as well as their own municipal taxes, balance their budgets and reduce bureaucracy. The third is to boost economic activity in the communes through funds being disbursed under the programme.
<p>
	Given the multifarious nature of the physical projects, a two-pronged approach has been adopted for their realisation. High costs schemes, those involving technology beyond the capacity of the communes, and those not within the latter's area of responsibility - such as hospitals, tarred roads and sanitary systems - are being implemented by a central authority. These have been denominated 'Projects of Central Initiative', and 107 have been identified, the majority at the request of the beneficiaries. Those schemes initiated by the communes and within their ability are being left to them to implement. These are called 'Projects of Local Initiative' and total 151 altogether. Particular importance has been, and is still being, attached to the participation of the municipal authorities beneficiaries at the various stages in the process covering identification, planning  and execution of projects.
<p>
	The general management of the programme is under the Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale des Communaut&#233;s Locales (DGCL), one of two local institutions identified by a working group during the preparatory period. The implementation of non-physical projects such as studies, production of technical documents, installation of computers, and supply of materials for environmental projects relating to domestic waste disposal, has been allocated to the Direction et Contr&#244;le des Grands Travaux (DCGTx). The coordination of partnership activities between the Ivorian communes and local authorities in the European Union has been given to a specialised non-governmental organisation - Cit&#233;s Unies D&#233;veloppement (CUD).
<p>
<h3>Late start but implementation accelerating</h3>

	Originally scheduled to be carried out over a four-year period, the programme did not start until the beginning of 1994, two and a half years after it was mooted. This is not unusual for a programme of this magnitude and, as a follow-up mission reported in 1994, the delay enabled adequate preparations to be made. The positive impact of these preparations are now beginning to be seen in the implementation phase.
<p>
	By June 1995, a number of the physical projects, particularly those stemming from local initiatives, had been completed. Among these were the reconstruction of Abiosso motor park, the extension of Adiake's indoor market (including the building of a number of shops and the paving of the surroundings) and the construction of an abattoir at Anyama. Projects with an emphasis on school infrastructures included a school canteen and shelter at Alepe, a new six-room school in Bonoua and the establishment of a municipal living quarter for students at Sassandra, while extensive classroom renovation has also been carried out at Dabou (42 classrooms), Bonoua (18) and Tabou (14). Among the completed health sector projects are a maternity unit at Sassandra and a dental care unit at Tabou Hospital. Finally, work on San Pedro's Bardo market and cultural centre was far advanced.
<p>
	Due to delays in the completion of studies entrusted to DCGTx, prolonged negotiations with the Health and Social Affairs Ministry, and difficulties in drawing up a convention with the Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Telecommunications, no major 'projects of central initiative' had been completed by June 1995. Since then, however, things have picked up with progress being made on several of the schemes under this heading.
<p>
	As regards the 'non-physical' projects, two major developments are worth mentioning. In January 1995, the Cit&#233;s Unies de D&#233;veloppement organised a seminar in C&#244;te d'Ivoire which brought together representatives of Ivorian communes and their European counterparts. This was the first gathering of its kind and it is expected to lead to more frequent and direct contacts, and to specific activities in the area of 'decentralised cooperation'. A convention was also signed with the Fonds Ivoirien de D&#233;veloppement et d'Investissement (FIDI) to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with access to financial and technical assistance in evaluating, setting up and managing projects. By June, 261 loan requests had been submitted to FIDI.
<p>
	A training seminar on 'the methodology of feasibility studies' was also organised for the heads of technical services and mayors of the 16 communes, while two pilot computerisation projects for the communes of Anyama and San Pedro, which have relatively large budgets, are being implemented.
<p>
	The programme as a whole is now being implemented over two phases. The first, which began in January 1994, is expected to end in January 1996. An external evaluation mission will report on progress made under the first phase and the conclusions drawn will help to determine the course of the second phase.

<P>
Les politiques d'aide destin&eacute;es &agrave; l'Afrique sub-saharienne
laissent-elles esp&eacute;rer une r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute;
du sous-continent ? Les programmes d'ajustement structurel produiront-ils
la croissance &eacute;conomique attendue ?
<P>
A la fin des ann&eacute;es 1970, les bailleurs de fonds multilat&eacute;raux
et bilat&eacute;raux s'avisent du besoin de mener une analyse
sociale du sous-d&eacute;veloppement, au cas par cas. Leurs travaux
continuent pourtant de n&eacute;gliger cette dimension empirique
et nuisent ainsi s&eacute;rieusement &agrave; leur propre efficacit&eacute;.
<P>
En premier lieu, les donateurs se forgent une image tronqu&eacute;e
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; africaine. Ils ont certes d&eacute;pass&eacute;
le sch&eacute;ma r&eacute;ducteur des th&eacute;ories de la modernisation
et de la d&eacute;pendance, qui rel&eacute;guait les institutions
traditionnelles au rang de survivance de l'&eacute;poque pr&eacute;-moderne
appel&eacute;es &agrave; dispara&icirc;tre, mais cela ne les a
pas conduits &agrave; renouveler leur cadre de r&eacute;flexion
sur l'Afrique. La Banque mondiale, notamment, privil&eacute;gie
le concept de soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, qui serait source
&agrave; la fois de croissance &eacute;conomique et de bon gouvernement.
Or, ce terme tr&egrave;s en vogue rend particuli&egrave;rement
mal compte de la r&eacute;alit&eacute; africaine. Il est presque
impossible de distinguer la sph&egrave;re priv&eacute;e de la
sph&egrave;re civile, notamment en ce qui concerne l'acc&egrave;s
aux ressources, leur contr&ocirc;le et leur distribution, tant
les deux sont imbriqu&eacute;es. Appliquer &agrave; l'Afrique
le concept de soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile consiste en fait &agrave;
transposer un sch&eacute;ma occidental selon lequel des institutions
stables et bien d&eacute;finies remplissent des fonctions pr&eacute;cises.
L'&eacute;conomie africaine ne fonctionne absolument pas ainsi.
Ses institutions sont au contraire extr&ecirc;mement &eacute;ph&eacute;m&egrave;res.
<P>
<H3>L'Afrique mal comprise</H3>
<P>
En second lieu, les bailleurs de fonds ont de l'&Eacute;tat africain
une conception typiquement occidentale. Ils sont conscients de
son incapacit&eacute; &agrave; appliquer des politiques et &agrave;
intervenir dans la vie sociale, mais se trompent sur les causes
de cette faiblesse. Ils l'attribuent &agrave; des facteurs normatifs
: d&eacute;ficit de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;, corruption, mauvaise
gestion. En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, le lien de cause &agrave; effet
devrait &ecirc;tre renvers&eacute;. C'est parce que l'&Eacute;tat
n'exerce pas un contr&ocirc;le suffisant sur les ressources productives
que sa l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; est faible.
<P>
Dans ce cadre, la prolif&eacute;ration des institutions sociales,
souvent encourag&eacute;e par les donateurs, complique davantage
l'acc&egrave;s aux ressources. Elle r&eacute;duit encore la capacit&eacute;
de l'&Eacute;tat &agrave; r&eacute;guler ces ressources et &agrave;
peser sur leur allocation &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
Les strat&eacute;gies d'aide cibl&eacute;e accentuent cette faiblesse
en apportant aux communaut&eacute;s et institutions locales des
disponibilit&eacute;s financi&egrave;res qui &eacute;chappent
au contr&ocirc;le de l'&Eacute;tat. Une telle politique est donc
peu susceptible de satisfaire ses objectifs de <I>good governance</I>
et de croissance &eacute;conomique.
<P>
Mais toutes les politiques d'aide tiennent insuffisamment compte
du milieu particulier o&ugrave; elles interviennent. En p&eacute;riode
de s&eacute;cheresse, par exemple, aider les plus d&eacute;munis
&agrave; survivre risque d'appauvrir encore des ressources naturelles
d&eacute;j&agrave; fragiles et menacer l'existence de la communaut&eacute;
enti&egrave;re.
<P>
Les ONG comme les donateurs bilat&eacute;raux et multilat&eacute;raux
semblent incapables de fonder leur perception de la r&eacute;alit&eacute;
africaine sur autre chose que des repr&eacute;sentations tir&eacute;es
de leur propre soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Tant que les pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
eux-m&ecirc;mes n'arriveront pas &agrave; corriger ces repr&eacute;sentations,
l'aide contre la pauvret&eacute; risque de demeurer contre-productive.

<A NAME="pre"><h2>Preface</h2></A>

<p>

The Irish Aid Advisory Committee has a mandate which includes the undertaking of research

on issues of relevance to Ireland's Aid Programme and the provision of expert advice to the

Minister for Foreign Affairs on matters relating to development cooperation and policy

aspects of the aid programme. This study stems from a concern about the lack of a clear

policy on Irish Aid educational assistance to developing countries. Given the extent of Irish

Aid, and of the Irish NGOs, involvement in educational projects and programmes, both

formal and informal, and the educational challenges currently facing developing countries,

the IAAC felt it appropriate to undertake a study in this sector at this time. It is expected that

this report can facilitate the development of a clear and consistent policy on educational

assistance which is in line with overall priorities set for Irish Overseas Development

Assistance  in the Strategy Plan of 1993. The report is not in itself a suggested policy

document.

<p>

This study was commissioned by the Irish Aid Advisory Committee and was carried out

between September and November 1994 by a consultant, Cathy Gaynor. The consultant

reported to a sub-committee of the IAAC, which reviewed drafts of the study as these were

prepared, including a draft of the whole report. The comments and suggestions of the

steering committee were considered in developing and finalising the report.

<p>

The scale of this study was modest in terms of budget and relied substantially on existing

sources of data from books, articles and other written materials plus discussions and written

responses to a short questionnaire from individuals and agencies in Ireland. The consultant

would like to acknowledge the help given by the agencies contacted and by Irish Aid officials

in Dublin and overseas who provided information and assistance throughout.

<p>

The help provided by the Educational Research Centre at St Patrick's College, Drumcondra,

the Development Studies Information Centre, University College Dublin and the Resource

Centre, Agency for Personal Service Overseas was invaluable in identification of the wide

range of publications consulted in the study. The support and contribution of other

individuals involved in Irish assistance to education in developing countries and the logistical

and administrative support of Catherine Gately, Executive Secretary of IAAC is gratefully

acknowledged.  

<p>



<A NAME="es"><h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2></A>



1.   This study was commissioned by the Irish Aid Advisory Committee. It examines the

dimensions of a policy and strategy for Irish Aid support for education in developing

countries. It provides an overview of current issues in education in developing countries and

of recent Irish involvement, both official and non-governmental, in the education sector. This

report outlines the findings from a literature review and from discussions with, and

information provided by, Irish agencies and individuals. Recent trends in Irish Aid to

education are analyzed and suggestions are made on possible principles and strategies for

future Irish Aid to education. It is hoped that the report will facilitate the process of

formulation of an Irish Aid policy on education and its implementation.

<p>

<h3>Issues</h3>



2.   At global level there have been improvements in education. Enrolments have

increased over the last two decades though most progress was made in the 1970s with a

marked slow down in the 1980s. There has been a reduction in the size of the gender gap

which exists between males and females in relation to enrolment and to years of schooling.

Progress has been made in lowering pupil/teacher ratio, in localisation of curricula and

examination systems and in raising literacy levels. These achievements were obtained as a

result of heavy investment by governments in education.

<p>

3.   Enrolments, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, have stagnated recently and the

quality of education has apparently declined. This stagnation since the 1980s has taken place

against a backdrop of austere structural adjustment programmes, increasing levels of

indebtedness, population growth and, frequently, drought and social or political upheaval.

Despite considerable investment, coverage remains low, teaching conditions poor and

learning achievements unsatisfactory. The lowest enrolment rates, at all levels, are in Africa.

Gender, ethnic, location and poverty based disparities still exist in access to education in

many developing countries. These are more severe at higher levels of education. There is

little provision made for children with learning difficulties or for early childhood

development.

<p>

4.   There is concern about the quality of education and the low standard of inputs to non-

formal and formal education at all levels. Teaching standards, teaching materials, buildings

and supplies are very poor. Public expenditure on education has declined and per-pupil

expenditure has declined markedly at all levels of education. Teacher morale, motivation and

performance are declining. The profession has lost status and there are still many unqualified

and undertrained teachers. Despite low levels of pay in many countries, the cost of meeting

teacher salaries places great strain on education budgets. Many countries are experimenting

with cost-effective approaches to teacher education which, it is hoped, will also lead to

improved performance.

<p>

5.   The rapid expansion in education in many countries has created problems for the

system. Management of education, at national and school level, is in need of improvement.

Most countries need to formulate coherent national educational action plans. Increased

capacity, at all levels, is called for. Technical assistance (TA) to education has not delivered

as expected. Despite heavy investment, by many donors, in this form of support to education,

it did not lead to improved local capacities. There is now a shift towards using more short-

term, higher skilled TA in an advisory capacity. Some countries with rapidly expanding

education systems will continue to need teachers as "gap-fillers" until sufficient local teachers

are trained to meet requirements.

<p>

6.   Financing of education is a concern in most developing countries, but particularly

those undergoing Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs). Due to declining public

investment in education, families are having to contribute more to the cost of schooling. An

increasing number are unable to afford to send their children to school. In some countries

poverty, together with decline in quality, have led to a drop in demand for education,

particularly in the poorer and more remote regions. Many governments are now seeking to

increase private funding of education and some donors are funding recurrent costs.

<p>

7.   Allocation of government resources and donor support by level of education, in Sub-

Saharan Africa, has tended to favour higher education. Since the 1990 World Conference on

Education for All (WCEFA), attention has focused on basic education, formal and non-

formal. This is argued on equity and economic-return bases. There are valid arguments for

the need for increased, not decreased, resources at all levels and many donors are seeking

to have a more balanced approach. The link between education and employment is a concern

which dominated the literature from the mid 1970s to mid 1980s. Experiments, overall, with

vocationally-oriented schools did not improve job prospects and were found to cost more than

conventional schools. There has been a recent shift away from this approach. There is

concern about, but very little quantification of, the brain drain of educated personnel, mainly

graduates, from the least developed countries. Some argue that the fellowship programmes,

run by governments and donors, should be better utilised to ensure effective capacity

development by focusing on institutional and system development rather than supporting

training for individuals. 

<p>

8.   There is much disappointment and disillusionment with non-formal education and

considerable questioning of the claimed achievements, particularly in relation to literacy.

Many argue that the approach, when attempted, was underfunded, lacked clear goals, was

inadequately planned and was implemented without properly trained tutors or the right

materials. There are arguments for reform, rather than abandonment of non-formal education.

Non-formal education is seen as necessary in order to reach the large numbers whom the

formal system has failed. Success tends to happen around well identified needs, adequate

backing and financial resources and, usually, when combined with economic benefits.

<p>

9.   Priorities for educational development have altered significantly in the last decade.

In response to this situation, many host governments and donors are changing their policies

for the educational sector. The current dominant policy themes include improving access and

equity, quality improvement and capacity development in the education sector. An increased

focus is emerging on developing national capacities, on the improvement of educational

planning and management, on partnerships between donor and host country institutions, on

provision of short-term professional training, on support for primary education and on

provision of basic skills. There is increased recognition of the need for a long-term time

frame and for donor funding of recurrent costs. The World Bank report on education in Sub-

Saharan Africa in 1988 and the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) in 1990

have been very influential in setting the present educational agenda. Donors are now giving

higher priority to education, especially basic education. The World Bank, Unicef, UNESCO

and UNDP have all indicated their intention to increase their share of funding which goes

to education. Many bilateral donors have revised previous policies and/or produced new

policy documents on education for the 1990s.

<p>



<h3>Irish Aid to education - analysis of recent practice</h3>



10.  Ireland has traditionally given high priority to education in its official aid to

developing countries. Of Irish ODA channelled through multilateral agencies, only a very

small proportion, slightly more than three per cent in 1992, goes to education. Irish bilateral

disbursements to education and training have remained at or above one third of total, at least

since 1982, and this has been maintained during the recent expansion of the aid programme.

There are three main channels for disbursement of educational assistance in the bilateral aid

programme (BAP). The chief means is through projects in priority countries. Existing and

new priority country programmes give attention and support to education with average

expenditure on education reaching 37 per cent in 1993. The level of funding channelled to

education through the NGO co-financing scheme has increased considerably, as funding for

this scheme increased, though the share to education declined in the 1990s from 36 per cent to 22 per cent

in 1993. Expenditure on training for host country nationals in Ireland has increased, over the

last five years, from 6.5 per cent to its present share of 8.4 per cent of the BAP. The number of

fellowships has also increased. Only a small proportion (about 8 per cent) of fellowships, over the

last five years, relate directly to the education sector. There are approximately two males to

every one female awarded a fellowship in recent years. According to statistics kept on all

foreign students in Ireland, by the Irish Council for Overseas Students (ICOS), the number

and proportion of students from Africa is declining rapidly.

<p>

11.  The main focus of Irish Aid education projects has traditionally been into higher

education, which accounted for 58 per cent of the total in 1989. Support for primary education has

grown rapidly in the 1990s to become the main recipient, at 43 per cent of total, in 1993. In that

year higher education took second place with 24 per cent of total. Technical and vocational

education and training receive modest but consistent support, around 16 per cent each in 1993, but

secondary education is hardly supported on the BAP (1.2 per cent) and non-formal education has

received no support at all. Analysis of technical assistance levels in education was not

undertaken but overall numbers have dropped from 78 in 1989 to 61 in 1993, despite a big

increase in budget.

<p>

12.  The Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO) funds Irish people rather than

projects. Development workers are placed by APSO with overseas governments or co-

financed to work with Irish NGOs and other bodies. APSO has always supported the

education sector, particularly at second level through provision of teachers, and about one

third of assignments have traditionally been in education. As part of the Programme for a

Partnership Government, an expanding budget has been promised to APSO until 1997. The

Agency has undertaken to try to reach 2000 assignments by the year 1997. This would

represent more than a four-fold increase in numbers over five years. The scale of the planned

increase has been questioned by some. The increase will mean greater numbers in education,

at all levels, and APSO expects to have 295 assignments in education in 1994, almost a

doubling of the 1992 figure. There has been an increase in share of APSO assignees at third

level and a decrease at secondary level over the last five years, with very little change in

share at primary level. This situation mainly reflects donor requests as APSO does not have

a stated policy on education apart from an expressed intention to increase numbers at all

levels, but particularly in teacher training and in English as a foreign language ( APSO's

Strategic Plan 1994 to 1997).

<p>

13.  Though not part of Irish ODA, Higher Education for Development Cooperation

(HEDCO), plays a considerable role in Irish support to the education sector in developing

countries. At present  HEDCO is implementing 17 projects on behalf of Irish Aid, the World

Bank, the EU and the UN development agencies. On these projects, links have been

established between third-level institutes in seven developing countries and 19 such

institutions in Ireland. Around 64 per cent of HEDCO's annual budget comes from Irish Aid and,

in 1994, in excess of IR1 million from other donors was channelled into education and HRD

projects in developing countries. About half of HEDCO's projects focus directly on the

education sector and the remainder on other sectors. Current projects support different levels

within the education sector, with greatest emphasis on strengthening of third-level institutions

and teacher education.

<p>

14.  There is a long tradition of involvement in education by Irish NGOs, including

missionaries of many denominations. Education remains the main sector of involvement for

Irish missionaries, despite a decline in numbers from the 1970s. Missionary numbers in

education in developing countries dropped from 1005 in 1990 to 810 in 1994. Approximately

two thirds are in Africa, with the remainder mainly in Asia and just seven per cent in Latin

America. Missionaries are involved at all levels of education and in both formal and non-

formal education. There is a recent trend away from formal institutions into non-formal, with

localisation of school management and staff. Many missionary organisations report an

increasing poverty focus and attention to girls education. Concern was expressed, by several

missionary organisations, about the effects of SAPs, decline in per-capita support to

education by governments and the consequent difficulty for families to afford schooling. 

<p>

15.  Some Irish NGOs, such as Trocaire and Christian Aid, have traditionally funded only

non-formal education. However both report that, in light of the austerity circumstances of

the 1990s, they are reassessing their positions on support to formal education. Trocaire

channels in excess of IR1.2 million into non-formal education each year. Concern is the

largest Irish NGO and, in 1993, expended about IR3 million on education and women's

training. There are numerous other smaller NGOs which support education and training,

sometimes within a particular sector such as health or agriculture. Support for formal

education by NGOs is almost totally at the primary level. 

<p>



<h3>Suggested principles and priorities</h3>

<p>

16.  It is clear that education and training play a major role in promotion of social and

economic development and that Irish Aid support for the sector is justified in the context of

the general policy guidelines as set out in the Strategy Plan (1993). Following the experience

of the 1980s, and prompted in particular by the WCEFA, there has been a reassessment and

adjustment of policies on education by host governments and donors. Furthermore, it is

argued that Irish Aid policy on education has evolved in recent years and that making the

new emphases more explicit, through development of a policy document, can only improve

the effectiveness of Irish Aid support to education. On that basis a number of suggestions on

policy and priorities are made. A summary of recommendations is contained in the next

section. Following are the main suggestions:

<ul>

<li>that education continue to be a priority sector for Irish Aid and attract one

          third of funding.

<li>that country-specific strategies, taking local needs into consideration, be

          adopted for Irish Aid involvement in education.

<li>that support for education be based on three principles of access/equity;

          quality; and capacity development and that policies be framed which address

          these goals.

<li>that priority be given to basic education, both formal and non-formal, with an

          overall balanced approach to support for different levels of the sector.

<li>that gender issues be addressed in all Irish Aid supported education projects.

<li>that the time scale for support be increased.

</ul>

<p>



<h3>Suggested strategies</h3>



17.  Developing a policy on education, and ensuring commitment to that policy, will

require wide-ranging consultation, much wider debate than this study was able to generate,

appropriate research and consideration and resolution of a number of issues. Decisions will

have to be taken on structures, strategies and mechanisms. Several suggestions are made for

further consideration. Amongst these the main ones are:

<ul>

<li>that additional educational expertise and a locus on education within Irish Aid

          be identified to facilitate and monitor progress.

<li>that Ireland exert every influence on multilateral donors to increase aid to

          education.

<li>that the implications of a programme versus project approach to educational

          support by Irish Aid be examined.

<li>that coordination, networking and collaboration within and between Ireland,

          developing countries and other donors should be actively supported.

<li>that the position on technical assistance, including the APSO target of 2000

          assignments by 1997, be reviewed.

<li>that better instruments to assess, measure, appraise, monitor, evaluate and

          report on progress in education be developed which will ensure

          implementation of policy.

</ul>

<p>

18.  Finally, there is scope for formulation of additional policy-related papers on particular

issues in education and training. The scope of this study was broad and there is need of more

in-depth analysis of a range of issues which could have a critical influence on the

effectiveness of Irish Aid to education.

<p>





<A NAME="sum"><h2>SUMMARY  OF  RECOMMENDATIONS</h2></A>



<A NAME="pri"><h2>PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES FOR IRISH AID INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION</h2></A>

<p>

<h3>THE POLICY FRAMEWORK</h3>

<p>

1.   Education indicators should be a major consideration in selection of countries for Irish

Aid assistance.

<p>

2.   Country-specific strategies for Irish Aid involvement in education should be developed

for each priority country.

<p>

3.   The level of Irish bilateral educational aid should remain at or above one third of

bilateral aid expenditure, even in an expanding aid budget. Every effort should be made to

safeguard educational aid in the event of an overall decline in Irish bilateral aid.

<p>

4.   It is recommended that Irish Aid support for education be based on three principles

which are improvement in educational access and equity, improvement in the quality of

education and increase in host country capacity to plan and manage education.

<p>

<h3>ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUES</h3>



5.   Irish Aid should continue to place emphasis on primary education, particularly in

assistance to the poor and to remote communities where access to education is limited.

<p>

6.   Irish Aid support for the provision of basic education should include support for

projects and programmes aimed at reaching those whom the formal system has failed.

Options include support for functional literacy, awareness raising and training for democracy

in addition to skills-based non-formal training.

<p>

7.   The guidelines for NGO co-financing should be changed to support this type of

training.

<p>

8.   Irish Aid should continue to address gender issues in education within mainstream

projects and programmes. 

<p>

9.   All Irish Aid supported education projects should be reviewed and appraised with the

aim of promoting greater access for females. Reporting on efforts and achievements in

relation to redressing gender imbalance should be mandatory for all education and training

projects. 

<p>

10.  There needs to be an active dialogue with national and local authorities in relation to

policy and practice with regard to girls' and women's education.

<p>

11.  Support to secondary education should be a country-specific priority for those priority

countries in which there is limited access.

<p>

12.  Irish Aid should seek to support ways of increasing access by disadvantaged groups,

including women, to higher education.  Cost-effective methods of delivering higher education

should be investigated and supported where possible.

<p>

13.  Support for technical education should be decided on a country-specific basis, taking

into account national and regional needs and demands.

<p>

14.  There is need for ongoing dialogue and debate on the proportion of Irish Aid by level

of education. This should respect country-specific needs but should also support development

of an Irish Aid position and targets by level of education which can then be monitored and

reviewed.

<p>

15.  Consideration should be given to the possibility of providing Irish Aid in the area of

educational provision for pre-school children, children with special needs and for

unaccompanied minors where situations have led to the exclusion of such children from

family and community support. 

<p>

16.  Consideration should be given to supporting research and pilot projects on alternative

delivery systems at all levels of education.

<p>

<h3>QUALITATIVE ISSUES</h3>



17.  Irish Aid should support pre-service and in-service teacher education programmes and

assist priority countries to explore innovative teacher training delivery systems for  primary

and secondary levels and for non-formal education. Other means of supporting teachers to

perform better, such as teacher centres and incentive schemes should also be considered.

<p>

18.  Consideration should be given to Irish Aid support for increasing the availability of

textbooks and other teaching materials at primary, secondary and non-formal education

levels. Given the costs of such measures, collaboration with other donors or support for

small-scale pilot projects feeding back to national level are recommended.

<p>

19.  Country-specific priorities and mechanisms for Irish Aid support to improved

management of education should be developed bearing in mind the twin goals of supporting

improved management at local level and better management at national level.

<p>

<h3>CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT & STRENGTHENING OF EDUCATION SYSTEMS</h3>



20.  Irish Aid to education should support the priorities of national governments.

<p>

21.  A comprehensive approach to capacity development in the education sector is required

involving provision of training, institutional development and support for development of a

favourable policy environment by, for example, supporting or organising conferences and

seminars on key issues in education.

<p>

22.  The time scale for such capacity building is more likely to be 10-15 than 5 years.

<p>



23.  Involvement of Irish institutions in capacity development for the education sector in

developing countries should be actively encouraged and their capacity to deliver should be

developed.

<p>

24.  A proportion of fellowships which directly support strengthening of the education

system should be prioritised. Additionally, local or regional centres of training and research

should be strengthened and used and part of the fellowship budget should be allocated for

local or regional training.

<p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF IRISH AID POLICY ON EDUCATION</h3>



25.  IAAC and Irish Aid should initiate a process of further consultation on development

of Irish Aid policy on education. 

<p>

26.  Educational policy and interventions should be built on a body of research as well as

field experience. This research should be encouraged and supported by Irish Aid in local and

in Irish institutions. 

<p>

<h3>IRISH AID COORDINATION IN RELATION TO  EDUCATION</h3>



27.  The human resource implications of developing and implementing a policy on

education and of spending one third of budget on education need to be addressed.

<p>

28.  There needs to be a locus within Irish Aid for appraising projects in the education

sector, for exchange and dissemination of information on education, including between

multilateral and bilateral aid, and for facilitating and monitoring progress.

<p>

<h3>BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL SUPPORT TO EDUCATION</h3>

<p>

29.  Irish Aid should seek to exert influence on multilaterals, especially the EU but also

the UN agencies, in relation to allocation to support for education. There should  be active

Irish Aid participation, in the current EU efforts to develop a policy on education and

training in developing countries and to coordinate member state activities in this field.

<p>

<h3>MEASURES AND INSTRUMENTS</h3>

<p>

30.  The implications of a more programme-focused and less project-located approach to

the development process in education needs to be explored to identify viable strategies for

Irish Aid.

<p>

31.  Where Irish Aid is involved at district or regional level there should be a mechanism

in place for feeding back the experience gained to educational policy development at the

national level.

<p>

32.  To respond to the demands of the new aid agenda, Irish Aid should initiate an on-

going dialogue and debate, in host countries and in Ireland, on educational policy

development and strategies for implementation. This needs to be an on-going rather than

once-off process.

<p>

33.  Inter-agency coordination, networking and collaboration should be actively supported

by Irish Aid within countries, regionally and globally.

<p>

34.  Structures and mechanisms for networking and collaboration between Irish Aid and 

NGOs involved in education should be supported.

<p>

35.  The shift away from concentration on long-term Irish TA towards use of short-term

highly skilled consultants should continue with greater use being made of host country skills

and expertise.

<p>

36.  There is a clear need to reconsider the implications of the APSO target of 2,000 by

1997 in terms of meeting the needs of the education sector in developing countries.

<p>

37.  There is need for formulation by APSO of a coherent policy on its support to the

education sector.

<p>

38.  There is need to debate how best to organise and implement Irish Aid support to

education and to develop a structure and strategy to optimise the involvement of all parties

in delivery of effective Irish Aid.

<p>

39.  There is need to develop better instruments for assessing, appraising, monitoring and

evaluating education projects and programmes supported by Irish Aid. 

<p>

40.  There should be regular monitoring and reporting of progress in relation to education

and a mechanism for rapid feedback and flow of information.

<p>

41.  There is need for more debate and scope for formulation of additional, more focused

policy-related papers on particular issues in education and training, relating for example, to

financing of recurrent costs, to involvement in the non-formal education sector, to assessing

the supply and demand aspects and impact of technical assistance, to the privatisation of

education, to application of policy in country-specific programmes, to development of

environmental education programmes and to determining structures for optimum delivery of

educational assistance.

It reaffirms that the human rights of  women  and  the  girl  child  are  part  of  universal        human rights.  It also recognises the necessity of broad-based  and  sustained  economic  growth  in  the  context  of  sustainable        development for social development and justice and called for adequate mobilisation of resources at the national and        international levels, and new and additional resources from all available funding mechanisms.        <h4>CHAPTER II - Global Framework</h4>        The Global Framework  describes  the  international  condition  in  twenty  six  paragraphs.  it  includes  references  to  past  UN        conferences; changes since the end  of  the  Cold  War;  the  movement  towards  democratization,  the  growing  strength  of  NGOS;        women and family; women and religion;  and  barriers  facing  women.  Implementation  would  bear  in  mind  the  different  cultural        and religious differences that exist in countries.  It notes that women play a critical role in the family and that various forms  of        the family exist in different cultural political and social systems.  It notes that the right to freedom of thought,  conscience  and        religion is inalienable and that religion and belief may, and can, contribute to fulfilling moral and ethical needs and to        realizing one's full potential.        <h4>CHAPTER III - Critical Areas of Concern</h4>        The "advancement of women and the achievement of equality" are a matter  of  human  rights  and  a  condition  for  social  justice.        This Chapter identifies political economic and ecological crises along with war and terrorism among the                  impediments        encountered  by  women  since  the  World  Conference  in  Nairobi.  Governments,  the  international  community,  civil  society  and        the private sector are called upon to address the interrelated  areas  of.  poverty;  unequal  access  to  education  and  training;        inequalities in health care; violence against women and the girl child, effects  of  conflict;  participation  in  the  definition  of        economic  structures  and  policies;  power  sharing;  mechanism  to  promote  advancement  of  women;  human  rights   of   women;        the media; the environment; and persistent discrimination and violation of the rights of the girl child.        <h4>CHAPTER IV - Strategic Objectives and Actions</h4>        Section A - Poverty: This Section describes the feminization of poverty and  its  causes.  States  are  called  on  to  ensure  food        security;  strengthen  social  safety  nets;  support  female-headed  households  and   anti-poverty   programs;   recognize   women        migrants'  human  rights;  ensure  access  to  financial  services;  use  gender  perspectives  in  economic  policy  making;   examine   the        relationship          unremunerated work and  poverty;  provide  new  and  additional  financial  resources  to  target  women  living        in poverty; and integrate a gender perspective into lending programs, including  structural  adjustment  program.  It  also  refers        to ensuring the full realization of the human rights  of  all  women  migrants,  including  women  migrant  workers,  and  also  calls        for                of documented women migrants, including migrant workers.<p>        Section B - Education: Actors are called on to eliminate discrimination in education; ensure universal access to and        completion  of  primary education;  increase  enrolment and  retention  rates  of  girls;  eliminate barriers  to  the  schooling  of  young        mothers and pregnant girls; eradicate illiteracy  among  women;  promote  equal  sharing  of  family  responsibilities  by  girls  and        boys; remove barriers to sexual  and  reproductive  health  education;  educate  rural  women;  and  ensure  sufficient  resources  for        educational reforms and monitoring implementation.<p>        Section C - Health: The theme of the text is "the human rights of women..to have control over and decide freely and        responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and  reproductive  health,  free  of  coercion,  discrimination and        violence".  A  commitment to  'consider  reviewing  laws   containing   punitive   measures   against   women   who   have   undergone        illegal abortions" was retained after the addition of a  reference  that  abortion  should  not  be  promoted  as  a  method  of  family        planning.  Language  on  parental  rights  and  duties  balanced the  right  of  adolescent  girls  to  privacy  and   counselling   with   the        rights and duties of parents.  The section also reaffirms the ICPD goal of universal  access  to  health  services  by  the  year  2015        and addresses gender sensitive program on HIV/AlDs and sexually transmitted diseases.<p>        Section D - Violence against women: Delegates resolved that in "all" societies, to a  greater  or  lesser  degree,  women  and  girls        are subjected to physical sexual and psychological abuse.  Among the types of abuse that are identified  are  acts  of  violence  in        situations of armed conflict and forced sterilization, abortion  and  forced  use  of  contraceptives,  prenatal  sex  selection  and        female infanticide.  The term 'female foeticide" was deleted and there are calls for legislation  against  female  genital  mutilation,        prenatal sex selection, infanticide and dowry-related violence.<p>        Section  E  -  Armed  conflict.  This  Section  links  peace  with  development  and  equality  between  men   and   women.   It   also   sets        forth the human  rights  abuses  that  often  accompany  armed  conflict  and  notes  their  disproportionate  effect  on  women  Actors        should:  increase  women's  participation  in  conflict  resolution  and  leadership;  train  officials  dealing  with  cases  of  violence        against women in situations of armed conflict; convert military industries to peaceful  purposes;  recognize  effects  of  excessive        military expenditures and  the  need  to  combat  trafficking  in  drugs,  arms,  women  and  children;  establish  moratoria  on  anti-        personnel land-mines and assistance in mine clearing; ratify international instruments   on the  protection  of  women  and  children        in armed conflicts; recognize that rape is a war crime; and protect, assist and train refugee and displaced women.<p>       Section F - Inequality In women's access to and participation in the definition  of  economic  structures:  This  Section  notes       that there are differences in women's and men's access and opportunities to exert power over economic structures and their       societies.  Actors are called on to promote women's self-reliance, facilitate women's equal access to resources, and create a       flexible work environment.  It was noted that women's unremunerated work  is  both  undervalued  and  under-recorded  and,  in  the       case of domestic work, is often not measured at all in quantitative terms.  Economic  globalization  exacerbates the  inequalities       between men and women.  Governments are called on  to  use  labor  laws  to:  protect  part-time,  temporary,  seasonal  and  home-       based workers; ensure that full-time and part-time work can be freely chosen by women and men on an equal basis; and       support opportunities for women and men to take job-protected parental leave and benefits.<p>       Section G - Decision-making: This Section notes that women's equal participation  in  decision-making  and  political  life  plays       a pivotal role in the advancement of women. Women are under-represented at most levels of government and in decision-       making positions in most other fields.  Actors are called on to: create a gender balance in government and administration;       integrate women into political parties; recognize that shared work and parental responsibilities promote women's increased       participation in public life; promote gender balance within the UN system;  work  toward  equality  between  women  and  men  in       the private sector; establish equal access for women to training.  The final text says women's participation in  decision  making       is needed in order to strengthen democracy and promote its regular functioning.<p>       Section H - insufficient mechanisms: This Section notes the lack of sufficient mechanisms at national, regional and       international levels for the advancement of women It calls for the creation or strengthening of national machineries,       integrating a gender perspective in public policy and generating gender-disaggregated data.<p>       Section I - Human rights: This Section notes that human rights are the birthright of all human beings.  Governments must       work actively to promote and protect these rights and the systematic and systemic nature of discrimination against women       must be taken into account when international human rights instruments are applied.  Lack of awareness is an obstacle that       prevents women from fully enjoying their rights.  Actors are called on to implement human rights instruments, ensure non-       discrimination under the law and achieve legal literacy.<p>       Section J - Mass media: This Section notes that the potential exists for the media to make a greater contribution to the       advancement of women however, few women have attained positions at the decision-making level in the communications       sector.  The continued projection of negative images of women in the media must be changed, and women should be       empowered by enhancing their skills, knowledge and access to information technology.  Action is called for to increase       participation of women in the media and promote a non-stereotyped portrayal of women in the media.<p>       Section K - Women and the environment: In this Section delegates called on governments and relevant organizations to       ensure full compliance with international obligations relating to the transboundary  movement  and  safe  storage  of  hazardous       and radioactive wastes.  It reaffirms the  linkage  between  poverty  and  environment  degradation,  and  identifies  unsustainable      patterns of consumption and production as the major cause of deterioration as well as noting the special risks that toxic       chemicals pose to women's health.  Noting the lack of recognition and support for women's  contribution  to  conservation,  there       were calls for an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective  in  all  environmental  policies  and  programs.       Governments are invited to encourage the effective  protection  and  use  of  "the  knowledge,  innovations  and  practices  of  women       of indigenous and local communities" in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity.<p>       Section L - The girl child: This Section notes that fewer girls than boys survive into adulthood and that gender-biased       educational processes reinforce existing gender inequalities.  Actions focus on eliminating all forms of discrimination,       especially education, health and nutrition and negative cultural attitudes and practices.  Actors are called to educate the girl       child about social economic and political issues and to strengthen the role of the family in advancing the status of the girl      child. Text was negotiated calling for the elimination of the injustice  and  obstacles  in  relation  to  inheritance  faced  by  the  girl       child by, inter alia, enacting legislation that ensures the equal right to inherit regardless of sex.       <h4>CHAPTER V - Institutional Arrangements</h4> This Chapter notes that, while the primary responsibility of States,       implementation is dependent on a wide range of institutions at all levels.  Actions are noted for the national       subregional/regional and international levels.  It was agreed to note that the FWCW is a conference of commitments, that       States and the international community have been encouraged to make commitments for action  A  high-level  post  in  the  office       of the Secretary-General to advise on gender issues was agreed. Delegates drafted language calling for: a strengthened       mandate for the CSW with sufficient resources, through reallocation of resources within the regular  UN  budget;  a  review  by       INSTRAW of its work program to develop  a  program  for  implementation;  and  a  review  by  UNIFEM  of  its  work  program  in       light of the Platform. Through work on resource issues, international financial institutions were  encouraged to  review  policies       and to increase the number of women in high-level positions.  The Bretton Woods and UN institutions are called on to      establish substantive dialogues for more effective co-ordination of their assistance.       <h4>CHAPTER VI - Financial Arrangements</h4> This Chapter notes that financial and human resources have generally been       insufficient for the advancement of women and notes the necessity of political  commitment  to  make  available  the  human  and       financial resources at national, regional and international  levels.  Resources  from  the  international  community  for  UN  funds,       programs and specialized agencies, in particular UNIFEM and  INSTRAW,  need  to  be  sufficient  and  should  be  maintained at       an adequate level.<p><br><center><img width=475 src="../owo_logos/online_logoconferences_line.gif"></center><p></body></html>

<H1>The Global School Project</h1>  

<P>School children around the globe share the same inquisitive desire to find

out more about the world outside their classroom. In the past this curiosity has

had to be satisfied by looking through atlases or encyclopedias. Now, the

Internet provides a new forum whereby children can learn from each other and

exchange ideas with their counterparts anywhere in the world. </p>

<P>The potential of this Global School is enormous; bringing children closer

together and creating a spirit of understanding and cooperation. The Global

School will also enable educational and training materials to be distributed to

any school linked to the Internet at almost no cost. Resources developed for

children in any country can be shared with schools throughout the world.

Interaid is involved in working with educational software developers in order to

build up a library of training materials fo distribution around the world.</p>

<P> To become part of the Global School, all that a school requires is a

computer, modem and suitable telecommunication link. Interaid is working towards

this goal by providing the relevant equipment and training to schools which are

not presently fortunate enough to have these facilities. Initially, this will

involve schools in the UK and South Africa but the long term objective is to

link up other secondary schools all over the world.

Le d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; l'am&eacute;ricaine</h2>
<H4>par <i>Alfredo G.A. Valladao</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>le Courrier de la Plan&#232;te</i><br>no.
33, mars-avril 1996: pages 41-42</H4>
<a href="../index_uf.htm">page EUFORIC</a><br>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<I>Les Etats du Nord ont plus que jamais besoin d'avoir au Sud
des partenaires solvables. Partant de ce constat, les Etats-Unis
imaginent de nouveaux outils de coop&eacute;ration pour remplacer
l'aide traditionnelle &agrave; l'Am&#233;rique latine par des relations
d'&eacute;change mutuellement b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Depuis la fin de la guerre froide, les investissements directs
priv&eacute;s dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement (PED) ont
pratiquement quadrupl&eacute;. L'aide publique, en revanche, a
chut&eacute; &agrave; son plus bas niveau depuis vingt ans en
pourcentage du produit national brut. De toute &eacute;vidence,
la fin du monde bipolaire est &agrave; l'origine d'une formidable
r&eacute;volution dans le domaine de ce qu'il &eacute;tait convenu
d'appeler l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
Une nouvelle mani&egrave;re de concevoir l'aide commence &agrave;
s'imposer avec d'autant plus de force qu'elle est d&eacute;fendue
par l'un des principaux bailleurs de fonds et la plus grande puissance
&eacute;conomique et militaire du globe : les Etats-Unis. En 1993,
avec l'arriv&eacute;e de Bill Clinton &agrave; la Maison Blanche,
le volet &#171;d&eacute;veloppement&#187; devient l'un des principaux
piliers de la strat&eacute;gie &eacute;conomique am&eacute;ricaine.
Mais il s'agit en fait d'un nouveau concept fond&eacute; sur la
notion cl&eacute; de prosp&eacute;rit&eacute; partag&eacute;e.
Son principe est simple : les &eacute;conomies des pays industrialis&eacute;s
arrivant &agrave; maturit&eacute;, leur croissance d&eacute;pendra
de plus en plus de celle des PED les plus dynamiques.
<P>
<H3>Int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts bien compris</H3>
<P>
La priorit&eacute; est donc de stimuler les march&eacute;s des
PED afin de cr&eacute;er une nouvelle masse de consommateurs et
favoriser leur int&eacute;gration dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale.
L'id&eacute;e d'aide dispara&icirc;t ainsi peu &agrave; peu au
profit de la coop&eacute;ration internationale pour un d&eacute;veloppement
durable int&eacute;gr&eacute;. Mais en quoi consiste ce nouveau
paradigme de d&eacute;veloppement pr&ocirc;n&eacute; par les Etats-Unis
? Il se pr&eacute;sente comme la combinaison de trois &eacute;l&eacute;ments
solidaires : les march&eacute;s fonctionnent, donc priorit&eacute;
au secteur priv&eacute; ; l'investissement direct dans le social
est crucial pour lutter contre la pauvret&eacute; et assurer ainsi
une croissance &agrave; long terme fond&eacute;e sur un march&eacute;
int&eacute;rieur le plus large possible ; la d&eacute;fense et
la gestion de l'environnement sont essentielles &agrave; un d&eacute;veloppement
durable.
<P>
Le grand laboratoire de cette nouvelle mani&egrave;re de promouvoir
le d&eacute;veloppement est l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re am&eacute;ricain.
D&egrave;s le d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1960, l'Alliance
pour le progr&egrave;s propos&eacute;e &agrave; l'Am&eacute;rique
latine par le pr&eacute;sident Kennedy sert de banc d'essai pour
la mise au point des premiers instruments d'une politique d'aide
reprise par la suite par l'ensemble des grands pays industrialis&eacute;s.
De cette &eacute;poque datent en effet la Banque interam&eacute;ricaine
de d&eacute;veloppement (Bid), anc&ecirc;tre des banques r&eacute;gionales,
et l'Agence am&eacute;ricaine pour le d&eacute;veloppement international
(USAID), le premier grand programme de d&eacute;veloppement. Aujourd'hui,
le continent am&eacute;ricain confirme ce r&ocirc;le pionnier
avec l'accord de libre-&eacute;change nord-am&eacute;ricain (Al&eacute;na)
et la grande r&eacute;forme de la Bid.
<P>
<H3>Exp&eacute;rience originale</H3>
<P>
La zone de libre-&eacute;change constitu&eacute;e par les Etats-Unis,
le Canada et le Mexique repr&eacute;sente une exp&eacute;rience
<I>sui generis</I>. Il s'agit de la premi&egrave;re tentative
moderne d'int&eacute;grer, au pas de charge, une &eacute;conomie
en voie de d&eacute;veloppement dans un espace hautement industrialis&eacute;.
Le Mexique, avec l'assentiment de ses propres autorit&eacute;s
gouvernementales, est ainsi devenu un vaste laboratoire o&ugrave;
sont test&eacute;es toutes les r&eacute;formes politiques, &eacute;conomiques,
administratives, l&eacute;gales, sociales, etc. qu'implique l'aventure
de la prosp&eacute;rit&eacute; partag&eacute;e. De m&ecirc;me,
l'ouverture &agrave; un espace pauvre mais dynamique de 80 millions
d'habitants contraint une &eacute;conomie am&eacute;ricaine hyper-d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e
&agrave; revoir son fonctionnement et ses r&eacute;glementations.
L'Al&eacute;na, en effet, sacrifie un certain nombre d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
locaux ou particuliers aux Etats-Unis m&ecirc;mes au nom d'un
nouveau dynamisme et d'une efficacit&eacute; plus globale. La
vigoureuse intervention financi&egrave;re d'urgence men&eacute;e
par la Maison Blanche pour le sauvetage du peso mexicain lors
de la crise de d&eacute;cembre 1994 a clairement montr&eacute;
que les deux pays assument d&eacute;sormais pleinement leur interd&eacute;pendance.
<P>
La Bid, quant &agrave; elle, est la doyenne et la plus importante
des banques r&eacute;gionales de d&eacute;veloppement. Depuis
sa fondation, elle souffrait d'une logique d'assistance. Les gouvernements
latino-am&eacute;ricains b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires la concevaient
avant tout comme un simple guichet de pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; bon
march&eacute;. Ceux-ci &eacute;taient accord&eacute;s la plupart
du temps selon des crit&egrave;res d'&eacute;quilibre politique,
sans trop tenir compte de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; r&eacute;elle
de tel ou tel projet. Mais d&egrave;s 1992, sous l'impulsion de
l'administration am&eacute;ricaine, la Bid entame une r&eacute;forme
interne en profondeur.
<P>
L'objectif est de limiter la &#171;politisation&#187; de l'aide
au profit d'un fonctionnement plus professionnel et de promouvoir
le d&eacute;veloppement durable &agrave; la place de l'assistanat.
Alors que les Etats-Unis r&eacute;duisent leur contribution financi&egrave;re
dans l'ensemble des organisations multilat&eacute;rales, ils ont
donn&eacute; le feu vert pour le doublement du capital de la Banque.
En contrepartie, ils ont convaincu leurs partenaires du Sud de
s'engager dans la nouvelle conception des politiques d'aide. R&eacute;sultat
: 50 % des cr&eacute;dits devront &ecirc;tre obligatoirement destin&eacute;s
aux programmes sociaux et au moins 25 % aux vingt pays les plus
pauvres de l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re ; 5 % du budget serviront
&agrave; financer directement le secteur priv&eacute; ; les investissements
priv&eacute;s dans les grands projets d'infrastructure seront
stimul&eacute;s gr&acirc;ce au cofinancement (maximum 25 % d'un
projet) couvrant essentiellement le &#171;risque pays&#187; ;
des fonds seront allou&eacute;s pour la modernisation des Etats
latino-am&eacute;ricains (d&eacute;centralisation, r&eacute;forme
du syst&egrave;me judiciaire, etc.) ; enfin, la transparence des
op&eacute;rations de la Banque devrait &ecirc;tre garantie par
une plus grande participation des organisations non gouvernementales
(ONG) et d'experts ext&eacute;rieurs.
<P>
La grande nouveaut&eacute; de cette r&eacute;forme tient certes
au poids r&eacute;serv&eacute; &agrave; l'initiative priv&eacute;e,
mais aussi au r&ocirc;le central qu'elle assigne aux ONG. <I>&#171;La
communaut&eacute; des ONG, </I>explique Brian Atwood, administrateur
de l'USAID, <I>(...) est la mieux &agrave; m&ecirc;me de d&eacute;cider
quels sont les besoins d'un pays pour son d&eacute;veloppement
(...). Quand, &agrave; Washington, nous dictons les contributions
financi&egrave;res &agrave; diff&eacute;rents secteurs au moyen
de directives ou de fonds attribu&eacute;s &agrave; l'avance,
nous sommes en contradiction avec ce que savent les experts sur
la mani&egrave;re d'atteindre des objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement.<a href="#atw">(1)</a>&#187;</I>
<P>
<H3>Fin de l'assistanat</H3>
<P>
Les Etats-Unis sont donc devenus aujourd'hui les plus grands
promoteurs d'une sorte d'alliance en mati&egrave;re d'aide au
d&eacute;veloppement, dans laquelle les gouvernements, le capital
priv&eacute; et les ONG devraient travailler main dans la main.
L'id&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale est d'encourager la coordination
des dons publics et priv&eacute;s, ainsi que d'officialiser le
dialogue entre les gouvernements et les ONG. Plus concr&egrave;tement,
il s'agit de favoriser des projets locaux, &#171;&agrave; la base&#187;,
qui seront jug&eacute;s et suivis selon des crit&egrave;res de
performance &eacute;tablis &agrave; l'avance. L'Initiative pour
de nouveaux partenariats (<I>New Partnerships Initiative</I>)
adopt&eacute;e par l'USAID en 1996 envisage ainsi de &#171;relier
les entreprises locales, les ONG autochtones et les gouvernements
locaux&#187;.
<P>
Les ONG assument donc progressivement un r&ocirc;le d'audit destin&eacute;
&agrave; garantir la transparence des projets et de leur suivi,
aussi bien vis-&agrave;-vis des gouvernements que des entreprises
priv&eacute;es. Une mani&egrave;re aussi de promouvoir l'un des
principaux objectifs actuels de l'administration am&eacute;ricaine
dans les PED : la lutte contre la corruption. A Washington, on
parle d&eacute;j&agrave; de &#171;franchiser&#187; la politique
de d&eacute;veloppement am&eacute;ricaine aux ONG, l&agrave; o&ugrave;
cela s'av&eacute;rera possible.
<P>
L'aide au d&eacute;veloppement, con&ccedil;ue comme un simple
transfert d'un pourcentage du produit national brut des pays riches
vers les gouvernements des pays pauvres, prend un s&eacute;rieux
coup de vieux. Aux Etats-Unis, l'aide classique est progressivement
remplac&eacute;e par l'id&eacute;e d'une action pour faciliter
l'investissement priv&eacute; et la bonne gestion des fonds publics.
Ces derniers devraient continuer &agrave; jouer un r&ocirc;le
important dans les pays les plus pauvres : assistance humanitaire,
alimentaire, sanitaire ou dans le domaine de l'environnement,
r&eacute;formes administratives et l&eacute;gales, privatisations,
etc. Quant aux pays &eacute;mergents, il s'agira surtout d'apporter
une expertise technique en vue de leur int&eacute;gration rapide
dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale. En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, les
Etats-Unis proposent aux gouvernements des pays industrialis&eacute;s
d'abandonner leur r&ocirc;le de donateurs de fonds pour celui
de &#171;monsieur bons offices&#187; (<I>facilitator</I>) et de
&#171;fournisseur de savoirs&#187; (<I>knowledge provider</I>).

<b>BEFORE THE CHINESE INVASION IN 1950</b> Tibet was a large country - as big as Western Europe and roughly a quarter the size of China. Then in 1965 the Chinese absorbed a large part of Tibet's two biggest regions - Kham and Amdo - into China. The third region, U-Tsang, became the 'Tibet Autonomous Region' (TAR) and this is what the Government of China now refers to as 'Tibet'. The TAR covers of an area of 1.2 million square kilometres. The area Tibetans call Tibet is more than three times the size at 3.8 million square kilometres.<p>

<b>Envisag&#233;s ensemble, l'Union europ&#233;enne et  ses Etats membres fournissent plus
de 50% de l'aide mondiale au d&#233;veloppement. Or, l'Union est rarement per&#231;ue
comme le principal donateur &#224; l'&#233;chelon plan&#233;taire. Cette situation, qui
s'explique par la tendance de l'UE (dont l'apport financier atteint 15% environ de l'ensemble
des fonds) et de ses Etats membres &#224; g&#233;rer ind&#233;pendamment leurs
politiques respectives de d&#233;veloppement, &#233;volue progressivement depuis
l'adoption du Trait&#233; de Maastricht sur l'Union europ&#233;enne en 1993.</b>
<p>
Bien que l'UE ait particip&#233; &#224; la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
depuis 1957, le fondement juridique de sa politique en la mati&#232;re est assez
r&#233;cent. Le nouveau Titre XVII du Trait&#233; de l'UE formalise l'existence d'une
politique communautaire de d&#233;veloppement compl&#233;mentaire &#224; celle de ses
Etats membres. Il reconna&icirc;t &#233;galement leur interd&#233;pendance, fixe des
objectifs et propose les instruments permettant de les atteindre. L'Article 130U pr&#233;cise,
dans ce contexte, que "la politique de l'UE dans le domaine de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement est compl&#233;mentaire de celles qui sont men&#233;es par les Etats
membres" tandis que l'Article 130X exige que "l'UE et ses Etats membres coordonnent leurs
politiques en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement". Le terme de
"compl&#233;mentarit&#233;" est apparu pour la premi&#232;re fois dans les
R&#233;solutions du Conseil sur le d&#233;veloppement adopt&#233;es au cours des
ann&#233;es 1970 et 1980 mais il a fallu attendre l'apr&#232;s-Maastricht pour que son sens
pr&#233;cis fasse l'objet de discussions approfondies. Ce d&#233;bat a &#233;t&#233;
suscit&#233; par les critiques de plus en plus vives formul&#233;es &#224; l'&#233;gard
du d&#233;veloppement et par la n&#233;cessit&#233; de trouver de nouveaux fonds en vue
de coop&#233;rer avec les PVD. Il a &#233;t&#233; &#233;galement li&#233; &#224; la
formalisation du statut de la politique de d&#233;veloppement dans le cadre europ&#233;en
et, partant, &#224; la volont&#233; de certains Etats membres de fixer plus
pr&#233;cis&#233;ment la limite entre la coop&#233;ration bilat&#233;rale et la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de l'Union.
<p>
A la demande du Conseil, la Commission a publi&#233; une communication sur la
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; et, en juin 1995, le Conseil a adopt&#233; une
R&#233;solution sur la compl&#233;mentarit&#233; entre les politiques et actions de
d&#233;veloppement de l'Union et celles des Etats membres. Le Parlement &#233;labore
actuellement son propre rapport sur ce th&#232;me.
<p>

<h3><a name="mis">Quelques id&#233;es fausses &#224; corriger</a></h3>
<p>
Le concept de la compl&#233;mentarit&#233; a fait l'objet d'interminables discussions entre
les parties concern&#233;es. Etant donn&#233; la pression exerc&#233;e sur les budgets
affect&#233;s au d&#233;veloppement, plusieurs Etats membres de l'Union ont
cherch&#233; &#224; justifier par ce biais une r&#233;orientation &#233;ventuelle de
certains fonds de l'UE vers l'aide bilat&#233;rale, craignant que la
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; permette &#224; la Commission de contr&ocirc;ler les
programmes nationaux. D'autres, par contre, craignaient une "renationalisation" de la
coop&#233;ration europ&#233;enne au d&#233;veloppement. Ce processus a abouti aux
interpr&#233;tations suivantes du concept de la compl&#233;mentarit&#233;:
<ul>
<li>une sp&#233;cialisation des t&#226;ches entre les Etats membres et l'Union,
bas&#233;e ou non sur l'existence d'avantages comparatifs;
<li>une "voie &#224; sens unique" par laquelle seule l'UE aurait &#224;
"compl&#233;ter" les activit&#233;s des Etats membres sans qu'il y ait d'obligation
r&#233;ciproque;
<li>un concept &#224; envisager dans la perspective du principe de la subsidiarit&#233;,
tel que d&#233;fini &#224; l'Article 3b du Trait&#233;.
</ul>
Il convient de souligner, &#224; propos de ce dernier point, que la
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; et la subsidiarit&#233; sont des concepts tr&#232;s
diff&#233;rents. La subsidiarit&#233; porte sur la division des comp&#233;tences, et
implique que les d&#233;cisions doivent &ecirc;tre prises au niveau le plus ad&#233;quat.
La compl&#233;mentarit&#233; porte sur l'utilisation des comp&#233;tences &#233;tablies
et exige la coh&#233;rence des d&#233;cisions prises par les diff&#233;rents participants
dans leurs propres domaines de comp&#233;tence. Comme l'a d&#233;clar&#233; la
Commission, il ne peut y avoir de compl&#233;mentarit&#233; en cas de divergence
fondamentale entre les philosophies, les objectifs et les politiques de l'UE et de ses Etats
membres. La compl&#233;mentarit&#233; exige, en outre, que les objectifs communs se
concr&#233;tisent par des politiques sectorielles communes, qu'un consensus se forge quant
aux besoins des pays en d&#233;veloppement, et que les activit&#233;s soient
&#233;troitement coordonn&#233;es. Ce concept ne peut donc &ecirc;tre envisag&#233;
comme une "voie &#224; sens unique": il requiert une participation active des Etats membres
avec les implications qu'elle peut avoir sur leurs politiques bilat&#233;rales respectives.
<p>
La compl&#233;mentarit&#233; suppose donc un partenariat sur pied d'&#233;galit&#233;.
Les pays de l'Union ne peuvent obliger la Commission &#224; soutenir ou participer &#224;
des programmes nationaux - &#233;tant entendu qu'une telle participation n'est pas exclue.
De m&ecirc;me, le Trait&#233; sur l'Union stipule que les Etats membres "contribuent, si
n&#233;cessaire, &#224; la mise en oeuvre des programmes d'aide communautaires". La
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; n'implique pas davantage une sp&#233;cialisation se traduisant
par la division formelle des t&#226;ches entre les diff&#233;rents intervenants - &#233;tant
entendu qu'il convient de valoriser les atouts des diff&#233;rentes parties. Si un Etat membre
particulier ou la Commission a, par exemple, une exp&#233;rience sp&#233;cifique dans
l'&#233;ducation en Tanzanie, pourquoi ne pas lui laisser le leadership dans ce domaine?
<p>
<h3><a name="wha">Le but de la compl&#233;mentarit&#233;</a></h3>
<p>
L'UE (y compris ses Etats membres) est aujourd'hui l'acteur principal sur la sc&#232;ne
mondiale de l'aide au d&#233;veloppement mais tout le potentiel de la masse critique qu'elle
repr&#233;sente n'a pas encore &#233;t&#233; exploit&#233;. La dispersion relative de la
gestion a effectivement conduit &#224; des recoupements inutiles, des doubles-emplois, voire
des actions conflictuelles. De l'avis g&#233;n&#233;ral, l'objectif de la
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; est d'atteindre une plus grande efficacit&#233; collective ce qui
implique la coordination, telle qu'elle est pr&#233;vue dans l'Article 130X
susmentionn&#233; (qui conf&#232;re &#224; la Commission la mission de prendre "toute
initiative utile"). Les avantages potentiels sont multiples: le double-emploi pourrait &ecirc;tre
&#233;vit&#233;, par exemple, par la mise en commun d'&#233;tudes, d'&#233;valuations
et de projets. L'allocation des ressources pourrait &ecirc;tre plus efficace par le recours
&#224; des comp&#233;tences sp&#233;cialis&#233;es, et des &#233;conomies
d'&#233;chelle pourraient &ecirc;tre r&#233;alis&#233;es. Des politiques
d&#233;cid&#233;es conjointement seraient assur&#233;ment plus faciles &#224; mettre en
oeuvre. La position collective de l'UE vis-&#224;-vis des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires comme
des donateurs s'en trouverait renforc&#233;e. Enfin, la charge administrative serait
r&#233;duite au niveau des pays en d&#233;veloppement qui traiteraient avec un seul
interlocuteur plut&ocirc;t qu'avec 16 donateurs distincts.
<p>
<h3><a name="has">Les &#233;v&#233;nements depuis Maastricht</a></h3>
<p>
La volont&#233; de coh&#233;rence entre l'action de l'UE et les politiques nationales a
d&#233;j&#224; donn&#233; certains r&#233;sultats. En 1992, les Etats membres ont
publi&#233; une d&#233;claration sur les aspects de la politique de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement &#224; l'horizon 2000, par laquelle ils admettent que les principes
&#233;tablis par le Trait&#233; sur l'Union en mati&#232;re de politique communautaire
de d&#233;veloppement s'appliquent de la m&ecirc;me mani&#232;re &#224; leurs propres
politiques bilat&#233;rales. Ils y conviennent &#233;galement de renforcer leur
coop&#233;ration au niveau strat&#233;gique et op&#233;rationnel, ainsi que dans les
enceintes internationales. Plusieurs politiques sectorielles ont &#233;t&#233;
harmonis&#233;es entre-temps et formulent des principes directeurs applicables aussi bien
&#224; la Commission qu'aux organismes nationaux de d&#233;veloppement. Des lignes
directrices ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; d&#233;cid&#233;es en ce qui concerne la
coordination op&#233;rationnelle, et six pays "pilotes" ont &#233;t&#233; choisis pour
acqu&#233;rir une exp&#233;rience pratique dans ce domaine.
<p>
<h3>Une coordination structur&#233;e</h3>
<p>
Consid&#233;rant que la coordination entre les Etats membres et l'UE gardait un
caract&#232;re trop ad hoc, le Conseil a convenu avec la Commission d'une approche
davantage structur&#233;e. Suivant les proc&#233;dures de coordination entre la
Communaut&#233; et ses Etats membres &#233;tablies en d&#233;cembre 1993, la
R&#233;solution du 1er juin 1995 en fixe les modalit&#233;s pr&#233;cises.
<p>
<h3>La coordination des actions</h3>
<p>
Les Etats membres, r&#233;unis au sein du Conseil, ont longtemps &#233;labor&#233; des
politiques sectorielles ne s'appliquant qu'&#224; la Commission. Les choses &#233;voluent
puisque les r&#233;centes lignes directrices s'appliquent &#233;galement aux organismes
nationaux de d&#233;veloppement. A ce jour, ces principes communs ont &#233;t&#233;
adopt&#233;s dans quatre domaines: la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;, la sant&#233;,
l'&#233;ducation et la s&#233;curit&#233; alimentaire. Bien que ces principes soient
applicables &#224; toutes les relations de l'UE avec les pays en d&#233;veloppement, dans
un premier temps, un certain nombre de pays pilotes ont &#233;t&#233;
d&#233;sign&#233;s pour acqu&#233;rir l'exp&#233;rience d'une mise en oeuvre
coordonn&#233;e. Le r&#233;sultat de cette d&#233;marche devrait enrichir la
coop&#233;ration dans l'ensemble des pays en d&#233;veloppement. Dans la
R&#233;solution du 1er juin 1995, les Etats membres ont affirm&#233; leur satisfaction
quant &#224; ce processus et leur volont&#233; de le poursuivre. La Commission
d&#233;terminera, pour sa part, d'autres secteurs &#224; approcher dans le m&ecirc;me
sens.
<p>
<h3>La coordination de la programmation</h3>
<p>
L'&#233;laboration des strat&#233;gies nationales (PIN dans le cadre de Lom&#233;)
constitue une phase capitale du processus puisque ces strat&#233;gies fixent &#224; leur tour
les orientations de l'action dans un pays donn&#233; au cours d'une p&#233;riode
d&#233;termin&#233;e. Une coh&#233;rence entre les diff&#233;rentes actions et, par
cons&#233;quent, une coordination s'imposent pour arriver &#224; une
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; &#224; ce niveau. Les strat&#233;gies de l'UE ont toujours
&#233;t&#233; &#233;tudi&#233;es avec les Etats membres au sein des comit&#233;s de
gestion. Cependant, pour r&#233;pondre aux crit&#232;res de coh&#233;rence et de
compl&#233;mentarit&#233; &#233;tablis, l'aide fournie par les Etats membres doit
&ecirc;tre examin&#233;e dans le m&ecirc;me contexte. La Commission a donc
propos&#233; de les int&#233;grer &#224; l'&#233;tude des strat&#233;gies de l'UE. Le
Conseil a adopt&#233; cette suggestion dans sa R&#233;solution.
<p>
La coordination des strat&#233;gies nationales rev&ecirc;t une importance particuli&#232;re
&#224; la veille de la prochaine phase de programmation du 8&#232;me FED. La
premi&#232;re &#233;tape est la r&#233;daction par le d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233; de la
Commission dans chacun des Etats ACP d'un document d&#233;crivant la strat&#233;gie
de la coop&#233;ration de l'Union dans le pays en question. L'objectif principal de ce travail
est la d&#233;finition des domaines o&ugrave; la contribution de l'UE pourrait
s'av&#233;rer utile, compte tenu des activit&#233;s d'autres donateurs (et des Etats membres
en particulier). La Commission a donn&#233; instruction &#224; ses
d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s de se coordonner sur place avec les Etats membres afin
d'exprimer un avis commun quant &#224; la strat&#233;gie de d&#233;veloppement et ses
obstacles majeurs dans le pays concern&#233;, et de d&#233;terminer la mani&#232;re la
plus efficace dont l'UE pourrait y intervenir.
<p>
<h3>La coordination dans les enceintes internationales</h3>
<p>
A l'inverse de la politique commerciale commune (pour laquelle l'UE jouit d'une
comp&#233;tence exclusive), la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement est un domaine
dans lequel l'Union et les Etats membres jouissent de comp&#233;tences parall&#232;les ou
"mixtes". En d'autres termes, si la Commission repr&#233;sente normalement les Etats
membres dans le cadre des discussions commerciales internationales, elle agit, en principe,
aux c&ocirc;t&#233;s des Etats membres en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement. Le Trait&#233; stipule en effet en son Article 130X que les Etats
membres et la Commission devraient coordonner leurs activit&#233;s dans les organisations
internationales et lors de conf&#233;rences internationales. Cette exigence vise &#224;
l'adoption d'une position commune qui facilite la t&#226;che lors de ces r&#233;unions. Elle
assure &#233;galement - ce qui appara&icirc;t plus important encore - une coh&#233;rence
entre les d&#233;cisions prises au sein de l'Union et les positions adopt&#233;es &#224;
l'ext&#233;rieur. Les progr&#232;s sont notoires &#224; cet &#233;gard dans la mesure
o&ugrave; les positions en vue de conf&#233;rences internationales telles que les
r&#233;cents Sommets de P&#233;kin, de Rio et du Caire avaient &#233;t&#233;
pr&#233;alablement coordonn&#233;es. La m&ecirc;me approche est adopt&#233;e en ce
qui concerne les r&#233;unions du Groupe consultatif et de la Table ronde. Il faut regretter
n&#233;anmoins que la volont&#233; politique de coordination de certains Etats membres
fasse encore d&#233;faut dans certains domaines, en particulier lorsque les institutions de
Bretton Woods sont impliqu&#233;es. Les pays de l'UE qui ont une repr&#233;sentation
directe &#224; la Banque mondiale et au FMI manifestent peu d'enthousiasme &#224;
l'id&#233;e de cette coordination - avec quelques exceptions telles que la coordination
efficace qui caract&#233;rise le Programme sp&#233;cial d'assistance aux pays les moins
favoris&#233;s d'Afrique subsaharienne.
<p>
Etant donn&#233; le r&ocirc;le majeur des institutions de Bretton Woods (et de la Banque
mondiale en particulier) dans le domaine du d&#233;veloppement, il serait important de
coordonner &#233;troitement les positions qui y sont adopt&#233;es par les Etats membres
de l'UE et de suivre les lignes directrices conjointement &#233;tablies au sein de l'Union.
Les Etats membres de l'UE disposent actuellement de 28% environ des voix au Conseil
d'administration de la Banque mondiale. L'Allemagne, la France et le Royaume-Uni (tous
membres permanents) repr&#233;sentent 13% des voix environ tandis que les autres
regroupent leurs droits de vote individuels, le plus souvent avec des Etats tiers. C'est ainsi
que les Pays-Bas "partagent" un si&#232;ge avec l'Arm&#233;nie, la Bulgarie, Chypre, la
G&#233;orgie, Isra&euml;l, la Moldavie, la Roumanie et l'Ukraine. Cependant, il semblerait
logique que les pays de l'UE ne disposant pas d'un si&#232;ge permanent regroupent autant
que possible leurs droits de vote.
<p>
La Commission n'a, en outre, qu'un statut d'observateur au Conseil des Gouverneurs de la
Banque mondiale et &#224; son comit&#233; consultatif pour le d&#233;veloppement. Etant
donn&#233; que l'UE est (collectivement) le donateur le plus important, il conviendrait
peut-&ecirc;tre d'envisager qu'une repr&#233;sentation &#224; part enti&#232;re lui soit
accord&#233;e comme c'est d&#233;j&#224; le cas, &#224; niveau &#233;gal, au sein de
la FAO.
<p>
<h3>La coordination op&#233;rationnelle</h3>
<p>
La coordination op&#233;rationnelle concerne la mise en oeuvre des politiques et
strat&#233;gies. Dans sa R&#233;solution de d&#233;cembre 1993 sur les proc&#233;dures
de coordination entre la Communaut&#233; et ses Etats membres, le Conseil d&#233;clare
qu'une &#233;troite coordination est souhaitable. Comme il l'avait fait pour la coordination
de la politique sectorielle, le Conseil a s&#233;lectionn&#233; un certain nombre de pays
charg&#233;s d'acqu&#233;rir une exp&#233;rience dans ce domaine. Un rapport
d'avancement de la coordination op&#233;rationnelle dans ces pays a &#233;t&#233;
transmis au Conseil par la Commission. Les conclusions du rapport final, attendu en fin
d'ann&#233;e, devraient conduire &#224; une coordination op&#233;rationnelle plus efficace
dans l'ensemble des pays en d&#233;veloppement. Les premi&#232;res exp&#233;riences
montrent que certains Etats membres ne manifestent qu'un int&#233;r&ecirc;t limit&#233;
&#224; l'&#233;gard d'une participation &#224; cette coordination. Tel est plus
particuli&#232;rement le cas de pays o&ugrave; une coordination intervient d&#233;j&#224;
dans un contexte plus large, y compris des donateurs non membres de l'Union. En outre, le
suivi de la coordination sur le terrain n'a pas toujours donn&#233; les r&#233;sultats
escompt&#233;s au niveau des capitales nationales.
<p>
Une certaine coordination a &#233;t&#233; instaur&#233;e dans quelques pays, bien qu'elle
soit ax&#233;e sur des secteurs particuliers (Programme de transport en Afrique
subsaharienne, par exemple) auxquels participent souvent des donateurs ext&#233;rieurs
&#224; l'UE. Ces efforts sont positifs et m&#233;ritent d'&ecirc;tre poursuivis. Si leurs
r&#233;sultats sont satisfaisants, l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t d'une coordination communautaire
sp&#233;cifique peut sembler limit&#233;. Mais trois raisons majeures militent toutefois en
sa faveur. Premi&#232;rement, une coordination s'impose pour concr&#233;tiser les lignes
directrices communes d&#233;cid&#233;es &#224; Bruxelles. Deuxi&#232;mement, la
position des Etats membres et de la Commission est renforc&#233;e lorsqu'ils oeuvrent
collectivement plut&ocirc;t que comme 16 intervenants individuels. Troisi&#232;mement,
le fait que les Seize s'exprimeront d'une seule et m&ecirc;me voix facilitera
incontestablement une coordination plus large au sein de la communaut&#233; des donateurs.
<p>
La responsabilit&#233; de la coordination sur le terrain est actuellement divis&#233;e, dans
des secteurs sp&#233;cifiques, entre les Etats membres et la Commission. Cette
r&#233;partition a une raison pratique, &#224; savoir une p&#233;nurie de personnel
ad&#233;quat. Sur le plan institutionnel toutefois, c'est la Commission qui est charg&#233;e
de la coordination (Article 130X du Trait&#233; sur l'Union) et, si elle veut assumer
efficacement son r&ocirc;le d'initiatrice de propositions, elle doit pouvoir exercer sa
responsabilit&#233; sur le terrain. Ainsi donc, si pour des raisons d'ordre pratique la
coordination dans des secteurs sp&#233;cifiques peut &ecirc;tre d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;e
&#224; des Etats membres particuliers, la coordination globale doit, en derni&#232;re
analyse, incomber &#224; la Commission.
<p>
<h3><a name="eva">L'&#233;valuation et les m&#233;thodes de travail</a></h3>
<p>
Le renforcement de l'efficacit&#233; collective exige de tirer les le&#231;ons de
l'exp&#233;rience. Aussi la Commission a-t-elle propos&#233; l'&#233;valuation commune
de la politique de l'UE et des politiques bilat&#233;rales des Etats membres en mati&#232;re
de d&#233;veloppement. Les pays de l'UE sont tous d'accord sur l'importance d'une
&#233;valuation mais certains sont r&#233;ticents &#224; y int&#233;grer leur aide
bilat&#233;rale. L'utilit&#233; de ce type d'&#233;valuation a pourtant &#233;t&#233;
reconnue par le Conseil dans sa R&#233;solution du 1er juin 1995.
<p>
La nouvelle approche d&#233;crite plus haut aura, &#224; terme, des r&#233;percussions
sur les m&#233;thodes de travail des Etats membres et de l'UE. Le bon fonctionnement
d'une coordination accrue exige, en effet, une compatibilit&#233; entre les structures
d&#233;cisionnelles des Etats membres et de la Communaut&#233;. La coordination sur le
terrain, par exemple, perd beaucoup de son impact lorsque ceux qui op&#232;rent sur place
ne peuvent valablement intervenir dans les d&#233;cisions prises au niveau de leur capitale.
Il conviendrait aussi d'assurer, au niveau national, une coordination efficace, voire une
v&#233;ritable int&#233;gration, entre ceux qui prennent part aux d&#233;cisions
communautaires et ceux qui sont charg&#233;s des programmes bilat&#233;raux. De
m&ecirc;me, les strat&#233;gies bilat&#233;rales devraient &ecirc;tre d&#233;battues plus
ouvertement dans le cadre de l'Union. La r&#233;cente R&#233;solution du Conseil, qui
sugg&#232;re en outre une compatibilit&#233; accrue entre les comp&#233;tences
d&#233;cisionnelles des d&#233;l&#233;gations nationales et des d&#233;l&#233;gations
de l'UE, repr&#233;sente un pas dans cette direction.
<p>
L'adaptation des m&#233;thodes de travail s'av&#232;re toujours fastidieuse et elle
demandera certainement, dans le domaine de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement,
du temps et de la peine. Le processus d'adaptation est n&#233;anmoins possible comme vient
de le d&#233;montrer la Su&#232;de en fusionnant trois services - respectivement
responsables de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, de la coop&#233;ration
industrielle et de l'assistance technique - en un seul.
<p>
<h3><a name="con">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>
Les Etats membres et l'UE viennent &#224; peine d'entamer le processus de renforcement
de leur coordination - appel&#233;, en d&#233;finitive, &#224; les conduire &#224; une
politique de d&#233;veloppement coh&#233;rente en Europe, mise en oeuvre par la
Commission et les Etats membres. Ce processus sera n&#233;cessairement long et doit
progresser par &#233;tapes successives. Il exige notamment un effort initial
suppl&#233;mentaire de la part de tous ceux qui y sont impliqu&#233;s. La
n&#233;cessit&#233; d'un engagement politique fait qu'un blocage est toujours possible.
Certains, craignant de perdre la ma&icirc;trise de leurs propres politiques, peuvent se
montrer r&#233;ticents. Mais il ne semble y avoir aucune alternative viable. Le resserrement
de la coordination est la cons&#233;quence logique de la poursuite de l'int&#233;gration
europ&#233;enne et le bien-fond&#233; de l'objectif, &#224; savoir une plus grande
efficacit&#233; collective dans le domaine du d&#233;veloppement, peut difficilement
&ecirc;tre mis en cause. Les contribuables europ&#233;ens comme nos partenaires des pays
en d&#233;veloppement sont d'ailleurs en droit de l'exiger.

Using Pictures 1 to 8 pupils working in pairs or groups, are given one picture.
Using this they could try the following: <BR>
a) 	Prepare a timetable or pie-chart for as much of one child's day as is
possible.<BR>
b) 	Make up questions to ask their child, which would enable them to complete
their timetable or pie chart.<BR>
c) 	Write a paragraph about their child and give it a title.<BR>
d) 	Draw a picture to illustrate the daily life of their child.<BR>
This could be a timed activity. Pupils could prepare a display of their
work and/or give a presentation. A discussion could conclude the activity,
in which your pupils compare and contrast their own lives to the lives of
Tanzanian children.<BR>

<html><head><title>Unicef  - Children First: Issue 32, Growing up urban</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#333366" vlink="#3399ff" text="#000000"><img src="../unicef_pix/unicef_logo.gif"><hr><h2 align=center>Growing up urban</h2>By the year 2025, six out of every ten children in the developing world will live in a city. More than half of them will be poor. Urban issues, and the strategies to deal with them, have been high on the international agenda this summer with governments meeting in Istanbul in June for the UN Conference on Human Settlements - &quot;Habitat II&quot;.<p>UNTIL the 1970s it was assumed that poverty in its most grinding form was to be found in the countryside, and that development agencies should focus their attentions on rural areas. Today, at least 300 million children in the cities of the developing world live in absolute poverty and in both industrialised and developing countries, poor children are crammed into overcrowded, unsafe and pol- luted areas offering few opportunities for learning or play. <table align=right width=150><tr><td><img hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 width=134 height=89 src="pg17.jpg"></td><tr><td><small>Image: The challenge of the future is to provide safe and healthy environments for the increasing numbers of children growing up in cities. These Cuban girls find plenty of space to play outside their primary school in the capital Havana.&copy;UNICEF/DOI95-0400/Barbour</small></td></tr></table><br><br>As well as being overburdened by efforts to make a living, many poor urban families lack the safety net provided by the extended families typical of rural areas. They can find it hard to provide appropriate care and supervision of their children, especially if they lack access to child care services and affordable education. These pressures, which are often coupled with violence at home, mean many urban children end up working, and often living on the street to ensure their own survival. &quot;UNICEF and so many of our partners have been determined to put children onto the agenda of Habitat II,&quot; said UNICEF's Deputy Executive Director, Stephen Lewis, in his address at the conference. And this determination was well received by the delegates who recognised the degree to which poor children are affected by the lack of resources invested in basic infrastructure in many urban areas. The conference recognised that: &quot;The needs of children and youth, particularly with regard to their living environment, have to be taken fully into account. Special attention needs to be paid to the participatory process dealing with the shaping of cities, towns and neighbourhoods.&quot; <p>UNICEF has certainly seen how community participation pays off. For the last three decades the organisation has been tackling the problems of the urban poor through &quot;urban basic services&quot; programmes, which call for a commitment to &quot;planning from below&quot; - communities themselves establishing priorities. <p>The Brazilian seaport of Santos is a shining example of what can be achieved through community participation backed by a child-sensitive local authority. In seven years the city has managed to cut the number of infant deaths from 34 to 22 per 1,000 live births, cut the school drop-out rate to under 1 in 100 students and even reduce the number of cavities in children's teeth by adding fluoride to the city's water.<p>This was all the result of a programme started in 1989 by the municipal government, which aimed to improve children's lives by expanding or creating new programmes in health, education and recreation. The campaign was strengthened in 1993, when the Mayor gathered the support of volunteers, business leaders, the media, municipal city government and community groups, including the city's two guardian councils - watchdog child rights groups elected by citizens. The key to the programme's suc- cess was encouraging these groups to run programmes such as job training for youths and a radio programme organized by children. <p>Children themselves have shown that they have an important role in improving urban life. In San Ramon, Nicaragua, a children's movement founded by 14-year-old Juanita Guerrero Artista teamed up with the town's Development Committee. At the request of the children, who voiced their opinions in the town's public hearings, the municipal government constructed a new school, sports grounds and 120 latrines in the town. &quot;Adults make decisions that affect children without realising that children can think and analyse by themselves,&quot; said Ral Lpez Dvila, the Deputy Mayor. Municipal authorities are key partners for UNICEF in its work for urban children. Since 1992 an international alliance &quot;Mayors' Defenders of Children&quot; have committed themselves to ensuring that children's rights are being met in their cities. At the World City Assembly preceding the Habitat conference, several hundred mayors made a particular point of affirming children's rights in the urban environment. Lewis says: &quot;They collectively agreed that child well-being is an indicator of good governance.&quot; <p>Ensuring community participation in cities that are well-managed and socially equitable is the recipe for a positive urban future. As Stephen Lewis states: &quot;If we can transform urban settlements into child-friendly cities, we will build a better world for all&quot;.<p> <hr>©Copyright: UNICEF 1996<hr><center><SMALL><b> [<ahref="../index.html" target="_parent"> UNICEF Home Page</A>] [<ahref="http://www.childrenfirst.org">Support UNICEF</A>] [<ahref="../news.html">News</A>] [<ahref="../events.html">Events</A>] [<ahref="../publications.html">Publications</A>] [<ahref="../education.html">Education</A>]</font></SMALL></b></center></TR></TABLE></center></body></html>

<blockquote>
<h4>RAMSAR AND PACIPE - FRIENDS OF THE FISHERMEN IN GUINEA-BISSAU</h4>




One of West Africa's most significant fresh water lakes has become the focus
of local and international conservation efforts: the Lagoa de Cufada has 
become Guinea Bissau's first protected site under the Ramsar Wetlands 
Convention.<p>
 The development has triggered the formation of a group of local 
fisherman committed to using traditional netting techniques and "no fishing"
periods allow fish stocks to replenish themselves. PACIPE, a novel EC-funded 
public awareness programme, will ensure that the lessons learnt in protecting
the Lagoa de Cufada are publicised throughout the region.

<b>Professor Jo&#227;o de Deus Pinheiro, the Commissioner with responsibility
for development, gave a short address at the signing ceremony for the
revised  Lom&#233; IV in Mauritius. The Commissioner was particularly keen
to stress the spirit of cooperation demonstrated by the ACP countries
throughout the negotiations. He also praised the perseverance of the French
Presidency when the thorny issue of the Community's financial offer was
under discussion. In the end, this question had had to be resolved by the
Heads of State and Government at  the Cannes Summit. With the benefit of
hindsight, Professor Pinheiro drew encouragement from this fact, arguing
that it bore witness to the importance which the European Union attaches to
this aspect  of Community policy. Below, we reproduce some of the key
passages from the Commissioner's speech.</b>
<p>
     My initial observation might appear to be a statement of the obvious, but it
is useful to reiterate that the fourth ACP-EC Convention was concluded for an
overall term of ten years and its mid-term review was not intended to be complete
renegotiation. I say this in order to avoid any misunderstanding as to the
significance of what has been negotiated. It is worth remembering that the only
thing we were obliged to do at the half-way point  was to negotiate a new financial
protocol for a second five-year period.
<p>
     Bearing this in mind, we can see that the mid-term review concentrated on
a number of essential aspects of mutual concern to the two sides. It is fair to say
that this was the case, even if the amendments or additions initially advocated by
each group did not always point in the same direction.
<p>
     What then, are the main lessons that can be drawn from the results of the
review process? Perhaps paradoxically, if one considers the new financial
protocol, the first point is that of continuity.
<p>
     The increase in the resources available to our ACP partners is admittedly
modest - of the order of 22% in ECU terms - for the next five-year period.
However, it should be stressed that when valued in dollars, the currency which is
usually used as the measurement when making comparisons in respect of
international aid, the rise is much greater at 49%. Whichever measure one
chooses, I think that the fact there is an increase amply demonstrates the desire
to maintain the special EU-ACP relationship. Indeed, it is a rare positive example,
contrasing sharply with the trend towards reduced aid contributions which is
generally being seen at both the bilateral and multilateral levels.
<p>
     Conversely, the other lesson that can be drawn is the flexibility of the
system. To some extent, this was the central aspect of the mid-term review
process, and it meant that it was possible to adapt to the changes which have
taken place since the signing of the Convention in 1989.
<p>
     These adaptations include the strengthening of the political dimension of
the ACP-EC relationship through the proposal for an expanded political dialogue.
More significantly, our desire to make respect for human rights, democratic
principles and legitimate government the key elements of this relationship has
been given concrete form. The adaptability is also demonstrated in our effort to
improve the efficiency of our cooperation system by offering greater consistency
between the various instruments and by promoting an approach to programming
which is both flexible and efficient. Programming is the driving force behind the
successful implementation of financial support. Finally, there is the fact that we are
targeting the economic dimension of our cooperation towards the development of
the private sector and the effort to make ACP products more competitive. This fact
alone is illustrative of a new dynamism in commercial matters.
<p>
<h3>Challenge</h3>

     These, in my opinion, are the main trends to emerge from the agreement
that we are on the point of signing. I should point out, however, that beyond the
establishment of the new orientations we are still faced with a considerable
challenge, namely the implementation of the 8th EDF and of the revised
Convention.
<p>
     It is also a decisive challenge to place Africa, in particular, back on our 
agenda of priorities and to make sure that the continent is viewed, not as a failure
but as a success. This success will itself be decisive in terms of the volume and
scale of our future cooperation.
<p>
     Given this context, what are the keys to success? It would be wrong to seek
them in an environment which is foreign to the players involved in cooperation. On
the side of the European Union, it would appear to me that an approach based on
a threefold imperative is required. I would refer to these as the '3 Cs':
<ul>
<li>consistency in the Community's approach, both in terms of the geographical
areas where the Union's development policy is applied and in terms of the
different Community policies;
<p>
<li>coordination of development actions between the Community and the Member
States, particularly in operational terms and in the various sectors;
<p>
<li>complementarity between the development policies of the Community and
those of the Member States.
</ul>
     For the ACP countries, the decisive element will be their ability properly to
diagnose their situation and their requirements. Control of the factors involved in
development can, moreover, only improve coordination between donors. We must
not, however, assume that coordination and complementarity have to be designed
for the exclusive use of the EU - they are, in fact, merely a starting point for
dialogue between the partners.
<p>
     I believe that these are the conditions which will enable what I would not
hesitate to term an avant garde economic cooperation policy to be implemented
on the basis of mutual respect between the partners and dialogue between equals.
Programming will be the first hurdle. The policy will also necessarily entail genuine 
transparency and proven evaluation capabilities.
<p>
     In terms of our priorities, this is also the context for development of regional
integration efforts and joint actions aimed at providing genuine socio-political
stability within Africa. If we fail to do this then our inability to prevent crises will
pose a serious threat to the future of development itself.
<p>
     Finally, we should not forget that the strengthening of production capacity 
sought by the authors of the mid-term review (including the provisions on regional
cooperation) is a particularly important instrument which should help the ACP
countries to face up to international competition.
<p>
     This aspect is all the more crucial since the globalisation of trade that we
are now seeing is a decisive factor in the erosion of preferences. To be able to
deal with this, it is no longer sufficient to argue exclusively, or even principally, in
terms of tariff advantages: we must set our minds to using any instrument capable
of enhancing the competitive nature of ACP products.
<p>
     These are the big tasks that face us in the implementation of our 
cooperation arrangements over the next five years.
<p>
     I have been talking about meeting deadlines. I should like now to conclude 
on a reflective note, looking at both the immediate future and the longer term. In
the short term, we must proceed with programming without delay. We must not
forget that one of the provisions we amended now obliges us to complete the
programming exercise - not 'as soon as possible' between now and the entry into
force of the revised Convention - but very specifically within twelve months of the
signing of the review agreement. By the solemn act of placing our signatures on
this document, we are thereby setting the 'programming' ball rolling. And the
exercise must be completed before the beginning of November 1996.
<p>
     In the longer term, we have to make appropriate and realistic preparations
for a new deadline, namely the renewal of the Convention. That takes us right up
to the end of the century which is not as far off as it seems. With this second
deadline in mind, we must direct our thoughts as of now to preparing the ground
as well as we can for the next quinquennial meeting
<p>
     To return to a subject I spoke about earlier, I have no hesitation in saying
that, while we may have reached another significant milestone here today, in the
life of the Convention, our work can never be considered truly over. This is not
intended to be a pessimistic statement. The task is not a Sisyphean one. On the
contrary, I would describe this 'perpetual return' as perhaps symbolic of self-
sustaining development.
<p>
     We should lose no time in giving thought to the task that awaits us. For its
part, the Commission is more than ready to meet the challenge and to mobilise
the necessary resources. I can guarantee that it will do so in a spirit of
comprehensive cooperation with all the political, economic and social sectors
involved. It will, of course, also do so by pursuing a constructive dialogue with its
partners in the ACP countries. The partnership is still, indeed is more than ever,
the motivation behind our cooperation, and the guarantee of our joint future. It is
all the more important to preserve this in a world where interdependence is too
often called into question by the philosophy of competition.
<p>
     For the present, our fervent hope is that we will be able, as soon as
possible, to take advantage of the success of the Convention to which we have
given a new basis. In signing on behalf of the Commission the agreement which
embodies this renewed impetus, I wish our friends in the ACP countries in
particular every success on the second half of the road leading us all towards the
next millennium.

<h3>QUOTE UNQUOTE</H3>

When Lenny Henry visited Somalia to make a film for the 'Night of Comic Relief' in March 1993 he said:
<p>
<ul><i>
"Of course the normal response to all this is to say, well, it's Africa, if it's not one problem, it's another, you know? So why should I bother? Why should I help them? What difference could I make anyway? No one should feel bad or evil about feeling that, because it is a normal attitude to have. But what we do know is this: if this was happening to a neighbour of yours you would bust a gut to help. The point is this: forget geography. These are your neighbours. This is your doorstep." 
<p>

</i></ul>
Jane Tewson - Chief Executive, Comic Relief.
<p>
<ul><i> 


"When we began Comic Relief we could never have imagined that ten years on we would still be raising money and still be raising laughs. The tragedy is the need continues to grow. We are totally thrilled at the continued support we get from the public. When there is a need they have always been there to help. There is much talk of compassion fatigue at the moment but we at Comic Relief know that the capacity of public to care and get involved is extraordinary, for which we are extremely grateful."<p> </i></ul>Paul Jackson - Chairman, Comic Relief.<p><ul><i>"What is strange but true and strangely humbling is the way that when Red Nose Day comes around, many of the greatest talents in Entertainment and leading professionals in advertising, PR, banking, telecommunications and across the media give freely their time and skills to help out. We could not do without them."<p> </i></ul>

Richard Wilson at Koboko Refugee Camp Northern Uganda, Christmas 1994.<p><ul><i>"I'm not going to say 'I don't believe it', but there are some things that are hard to believe. It's hard to believe that the people here are left with so little. It's hard to believe that their lives will ever be right again. But there's something else that's hard to believe. It's hard to believe that when I did that Comic Relief sketch two years ago, lying in a bath with only a flannel covering my privates and you rang in money, we were directly helping the people in this camp."<p> </i></ul>Michelle from Panda (Peoples Alternative to narcotics Drugs and Alcohol)<p><ul><i>"Without PANDA I don't think I could cope, because I'm still in the very early stages of recovery and to me this place plays a very big part of my life. I spend most of my days in here working, and at nights I come to meetings and socialise."
</i></ul>
<p>
<h3>"SOME OF THE STATISTICS THAT KEEP US GOING"</h3>
<ul>
<li>18 of the 20 poorest countries in the world are in Africa. Millions of people are displaced and living difficult lives because of conflict. Many more face a daily struggle to meet their basic needs like simply having clean water.
<li>There are still many thousands of young homeless people in the UK who need help and support.
<li>There are 6 million disabled people in the UK, yet young disabled people are still excluded from most schools and many find travel on public transport inaccessible.
<li>There are 10 million older people in the UK: two million live on the breadline and one million below it. Too many older people still live in real poverty.
</ul>

<h3>Press Launch of Red Nose Day '95</h3>
Tuesday 7th February: It's 38 days to Red Nose Day '95.  At London's Empire Leicester Square, media celebrities - including Lenny Henry, Richard Wilson, Jonathan Ross, Angus Deayton and Emma Freud - combine forces to put out the word on this year's extravaganza.<p>
This time the theme is <i>difference</i> - one day spent fooling about for Comic Relief will make a crucial difference to the lives of some of the poorest people in the UK and in Africa.
<P>
<h3>SOME OF THE SOUND BITES...</h3>
<b>Paul Jackson, Chair, Comic Relief/Charity Projects</b><br>
<ul><ul><ul><ul>


</ul></ul></ul></ul>
"I want to make one point about the 'golden pound', as we call it, for Comic Relief. Obviously it costs a lot of money to organise something like Comic Relief - and here today you see a lot of money being spent. But today's a case in point. Not a single penny from today has been contributed by the charity. All the expenses of the day have been sponsored or contributed by the people we work with. So the 'golden pound' means every penny that anybody gives between now and March 17th will go directly to the beneficiaries intended with nothing taken off the top."
<P>
<b>Lenny Henry</b><br>
<ul><ul><ul><ul>


</ul></ul></ul></ul>
"Last Red Nose day was a fantastic, groovelistic success. We raised over £18 million to take our grand total to date to over £92 million.  And this year we're going to pass the £100 million mark. We've had great time making the new TV show. 
<p>
"Richard Wilson, Billy Connolly and Victoria Wood have all been completely brilliant and generous with their time and travelled out to Africa for us to report back on projects we fund there. And we make television history by pairing Jane Torvill and Rowan Atkinson, skating together to create the soon-to-be-legendary Torvill and Bean.
<p>
<ul><ul><ul><ul>


</ul></ul></ul></ul>

"Every year we do have the red noses, which I'm sure you know and love and we all look forward to wearing all the time. And every year we put a little twist in them. This year we decided to go with the new, magical, colour-changing nose. When first viewed, the nose is that lovely plastic red colour we all favour. But when it's rubbed up against any part of your anatomy that's warm - as Emma Freud will now demonstrate...
<ul><ul><ul><ul>

</ul></ul></ul></ul>
...it does magically change colour. There you go - the pinkest of pinks and the yellowest of yellows. And we have car noses: they change colour as well. If it's a very cold morning, below freezing, you find it goes purple.
<p>
"So all of these products will hopefully raise many millions of pounds, as they have done each year."

<p>
<b>Jane Tewson, Chief Executive, Comic Relief/Charity Projects</b><br>
<ul><ul><ul><ul>



</ul></ul></ul></ul>
"The reasons that we set up Comic Relief nine years ago are even more pressing today. I'm ashamed to say that - because I couldn't have believed that things would be worse. I was working in Ethiopia and the Sudan at the height of the famine, and I was working with people with disabilities before that. And it was pretty terrible then. But now, here in the UK, for example, homelessness, which was just emerging as a problem in 1984, has escalated. Centrepoint estimate that there are over 50,000 young people without a home in central London alone. And in Africa 11,700 children die every day from very preventable diseases like malaria and diarrhoea. So the needs are growing. And we've done an awful lot, but we need to do more and we need your help to do more.
<p>
"Comic Relief is very much committed to people. And what gives us hope is the people themselves that we are helping - their communities and the programmes that they run for themselves. There's much more to Africa than the emergencies that we are always seeing on television. Comic Relief exists to work with these people to overcome their problems. And we're proud to be supporting African people to work to solve their own problems.
<p>
"I'm going to give you a small example of how we spend our money, and the example is from Burundi. Burundi isn't in the news at the moment, but over the past two weeks there have been many massacres and killings of innocent people. On Thursday, a school was hand-grenaded. Three children were killed and many more were maimed. This could be the next genocide, following Rwanda. And it was wonderful that Comic Relief was able within a few days to make an emergency grant to fund the African component of a conference that was attempting to bring round the table all the people concerned in Burundi. This was local Burundi leaders, the United Nations, world governments and international charities, and they were working together to try to prevent a tragedy."

LENNY HENRY will start the night of <b>Comic Relief </b> at 7pm on Friday March 17th on BBC1. Then he travels to Belfast during the programme to host a live St Patrick's Day broadcast from the Grand Opera House in Belfast, featuring BEN ELTON, JULIAN CLAREY, JO BRAND  and PATRICK KIELTY.
<p>
This year's other presenters include CHRIS EVANS, HARRY ENFIELD, PAUL WHITEHOUSE and chums, DAWN FRENCH and JENNIFER SAUNDERS, MEL SMITH and GRIFF RHYS JONES. Collectively they will create 6 hours of definitive live television and attempt to set new records in money raised on the night. Each hour will feature wild and wicked ways of getting people to raise money and raise a laugh.
<p>
In March 1993, we manned 750 phone lines and were inundated with calls from the time the programme started to the moment it finished. For 1995 we have set up a total of 5,000 phone lines to collect the public's money.
<p>
It will be a fabulous event, an unmissable night of TV, a mean-machine of fundraising, featuring original comedy to delight and thank our supporters, and original material to show why Comic Relief has to keep on keeping on.
<p>
<h3>New Comedy</h3>

We couldn't get Charles Dickens, but Richard Curtis has been persuaded to write OLIVER 2, the sequel to Oliver Twist. The world (or at least Lionel Bart) thought Oliver's story was over but, as will be revealed, it has only just begun. This sumptuous costume drama in three short parts is performed by Dame Diana Rigg, Pauline Collins, Alan Cumming, Michael Palin, Jeremy Irons, Angus Deayton, Stephen Fry and Oliver Reed to name but eight.
<p>
We present a unique opportunity to witness Jayne Torvill and Rowan Atkinson skate together as, obviously, TORVILL and BEAN. This Comic Relief Exclusive will feature BOLERO as never seen before and an extraordinary performance of LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE.
<p>
PHIL COLLINS has recorded a rather unusual version of OLD MACDONALD HAD A FARM with a remarkable stable of animal impersonators that boasts Goldie Hawn as a duck, Martin Sheen as a cow, Emma Thompson as a pig, Whoopi Goldberg as a chicken, Hugh Grant as a cat and Desmond Tutu as a sheep.
<p>
RUBY WAX is going ON THE RAMPAGE to try and raise RUBY'S MILLION. Anywhere Anneke Rice can go, Ruby can go badder - she'll spend the programme bribing, scheming and blackmailing the British Public (especially the rich ones) to help her raise her own million to add to the pot.
<p>
DROP THE DEAD DONKEY are creating a wickedly funny and shockingly up to the minute DTDD Special just for Comic Relief. Victoria Wood has written a comedy special called 'Dawn' featuring Dawn French. Viewers should also look out for bits by other regular Comic Reliefers like Jonathan Ross, Joanna Lumley, Tony Robinson, Ade Edmonson and Rik Mayall.
<p>

<h3>New Documentaries </H3>
<h4>In the UK </h4>
For the first time ever on Comic Relief, We have asked some of the people who have received Red Nose money here in the UK to tell their own stories. <p>There is the story of how Michelle in Belfast overcame drug dependency with teh help of PANDA (Peoples Alternatives to Narcotics Drugs and Alcohol); of Damien Barry in Birmingham working to create opportunities for deaf people with Friends of the Young Deaf; and of how Claude Hendrickson and Randolph Morton (and an inspiring group of unemployed), young men in Leeds who decided to fight being homeless by building their own homes.

<h4>In Africa </h4>
We've also asked some of our comedians to report on the work in Africa. BILLY CONNOLLY revisits some of the projects he first saw in Mozambique in 1989 to find a real sense of progress and hope now the war is over.
<p>
RICHARD WILSON spends time in a refugee camp in Northern Uganda and sees first-hand just how crucial Red Nose cash can be to those living on the edge.
<p>
VICTORIA WOOD goes to Zimbabwe to stay with a family for week and experience what it feels like to live in an area threatened by serious drought. 
<p>
We will also be screening two full length documentaries on BBC1 during the Red Nose campaign:
<p>
<ul>The first follows Billy Connolly on his trip to Mozambique and is a close-up of his emotional journey as he meets and talks with local people.
<p>
The second is a fuller insight into the world of Michelle in Belfast as she leads us through her struggle to stay off drugs.
</ul><p>
Finally with the support of Live and Kicking and Harper Collins we are producing the Live and Kicking Comedy Showcase, a compilation of jokes and sketches written by their viewers and available in all good bookshops.

<h2>What a Difference a Day Makes</h2>
Red Nose Day this year is focusing on difference - one day spent fooling about for Comic Relief will make a crucial difference to the lives of some of the poorest people here in the UK and in Africa.
<h2>The Night of Comic Relief</h2>
<b>BBC1 - Friday March 17th - 7pm to 1am</b>
<p>
It will be a fabulous event, an unmissable night of TV, a mean-machine of fundraising, featuring original comedy to delight and thank our supporters, and original material to show why Comic Relief has to keep on keeping on.
<p>
This year's other presenters include CHRIS EVANS, HARRY ENFIELD, PAUL WHITEHOUSE and chums, DAWN FRENCH and JENNIFER SAUNDERS, MEL SMITH and GRIFF RHYS JONES. Collectively they will create 6 hours of definitive live television and attempt to set new records in money raised on the night. Each hour will feature wild and wicked ways of getting people to raise money and raise a laugh.
<p>
In March 1993, we manned 750 phone lines and were inundated with calls from the time our programme started to the moment it finished. For 1995 we have set up a total of 5,000 phone lines to collect the public's money.
<p>
<h2>BBC Radio 1FM</h2>
Radio 1FM will be supporting Comic Relief as never before with five weeks of comedy, competitions and documentaries.
<p>
BILLY CONNOLLY recorded a special series of reports when he was in Africa, which will be broadcast exclusively on 1FM.
<p>
1FM will be waging THE WAR OF THE NOSES as each day-time show adopts an area of the country to see which houses the most outwardlyrageous inhabitants.
<p>
The week leading up to Red Nose Day will climax in a series of live broadcasts from around the country as the search hots up for the most imaginative and active fundraisers. Those demonstrating particular ingenuity will be rewarded with THE ORDER OF THE NOSE - a special medal in recognition of the highest originality in the face of battle.
<p>
And on Mark Goodier's Show, there's the chance to win a fantastic customised RED NOSE CAR, when listeners' cars are spotted sporting the new magical colour-changing cold nose.
<p>
<h2>A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION</H2>
Our education programme, which began in 1990, aims to pass on the knowledge gained through the experience of fundraising and grant making. We are thrilled at the incredible support given over the ten years by the public in raising money. However, we believe that, lasting change will only come about by raising awareness too. It is crucial not only to make people aware of the needs which their money will help to address, but also some of the causes and potential solutions that can contribute to resolving those needs.<p>
To date the education programme has been a mixture of three different types of work:
<p><ul>
<li> we have run educational projects in association with TV programmes like Going Live! which have challenged young people to create something that explores the issues arising from their work. These have included Video Relief, News Relief, and Pop Relief.<p>
<li> we have produced resources for the classroom dealing with development issues in Africa and the background to their areas of funding in the UK.
<p>
<li> we have reported back through short documentaries on the BBC and regular Newsletters to their supporters and the general public on where money from Red Nose Day has been spent.
</ul>
<p>
To co-incide with Red Nose Day '95, we have been able to provide FREE to nearly 4,000 schools to date a specifically commissioned RIOTOUS ASSEMBLY pack. This pack includes a Comic Relief RIOTOUS ASSEMBLY tape with Ben Elton and Tony Robinson - so that teachers can pop the cassette into the video and let the assembly take care of itself. The main issues covered are Disability Access and Fair Trade.<p>
The good news is, they've all gone, the bad news is, they've all gone!
<p>
<h4>Teacher Relief 2</h4>

This is an interactive video pack for secondary schools based around the best footage from Comic Relief's documentary output of the last three years. Targeted at Key Stage 3 and above of the National Curriculum, it aims to provide a grounding in the skills, knowledge and attitudes that will enable young people to make an informed and active response to the challenge of good citizenship in its broadest context.<p>
<h4>Altogether Better Resource Pack</h4>
This pack is aimed at teachers and school governors and combines a booklet and video which explains clearly why it is important to educate disabled children in mainstream schools. Including a history of disabled people in education, it gives lots of examples of how to put inclusion into action. An excellent resource to help schools understand the issues and face the challenge of implementing the Code of Practise for Special Needs.

<h2>Get involved yourself</h2>

Last Red Nose Day over 140,000 events took place across the UK, the press wrote over 3,500 articles in support of the campaign and more than 24 million people tuned into the TV show. We need to maintain this unprecedented backing to ensure the success of this year's event.
<p>
A small change in people's behaviour on March 17th will make a big difference to the lives of some of the poorest people in the UK and Africa. We want people think up crazy things to do, to get sponsored by their friends and family to do them, and then send Comic Relief the cash. After research into the most popular ways to raise a bucketload, We've compiled a list of the Red Nose Top Ten Best Fundraising Ideas Of All Time. They're all featured in <b>THE NEW FREE RED NOSE DAY FUNDRAISING PACK</b> - AVAILABLE BY CALLING 0891 665544.
<P> It also contains details of how to:<P>
<b>SPLAT THE BOSS</b> - people in offices, schools, on newspapers, in fact anywhere that has a boss-type person can raise cash through the glorious use of glutinous goo. We promise absolutely hysterical fun for absolutely everybody - exept if you're a boss - in which case this is disgusting. People can order their very own SPLAT KIT via the Red Nose Day Fundraising Pack.
<p>
This year is also the launch of the first ever <b>PET NOSE DAY.</b> It's time for family pets to no longer feel excluded. They can get their faithful owners out of the armchair for sponsored walkies or owner agility tests. We have scores of ways for pets to raise cash - they should start by ordering a free PET NOSE DAY PACK by calling 0891 333326<p>
Run your own <B>NOT A LOTTERY - THE COMIC RELIEF SWEEPSTAKE.</b> No million pound prizes this time, but the chance to help raise more cash for the Red Nose. Keenies are invited to organise their own sweepstake at their place of work, to have a flutter and win "not a lot ". Winners are asked to make a donation from their winnings to Comic Relief. Base your sweepstake on the grand draw of a Spitting Image sketch on the Night of Comic Relief.<p>
It is time for all energetic types to <b>BE A SPORT</b> and <b>GET YOUR KIT ON FOR COMIC RELIEF</b>. There is no sport playable in this country that wouldn't benefit from a special Comic Relief-ified Red Nose Day Match- Tiddliwinks between Teachers and Turnips, Rugby in Drag or a good old balls up.<p>

<h2>NO BUSINESS LIKE NOSE BUSINESS</H2>
We state clearly at the point of sale for all Comic Relief products just exactly how much money is going to the charity. And then every penny of this goes to projects in the UK and Africa. All the production costs for the deals below are paid for by supporting companies, so there is no financial risk to the charity.
<h3>JUST SOME OF THE PRODUCTS</H3>
<H4>The Magical Human Nose</h4>
This year, the lynch-pin of Red Nose Day - that's The Red Nose - starts off a vibrant Red. But when it comes into contact with the heat of your skin, in a matter of seconds it turns magically FLUORESCENT PINK or YELLOWEST YELLOW. 
<H4>The Just as Magical Cold Nose for your Car</h4>
This is no ordinary Red Car Nose. Again it starts off bright red - but when the temperature drops below freezing it turns deep purple. Place your hand on it and create a hand-shaped red patch. <h4>The also Highly Magical T-Shirt</h4>
The key to this one is body heat.  Our exclusive T-Shirt carries an original design by Bang on the Door and responds to any rise in corporeal temperature - as your cool bits go hotter, its purple bits go pink and its red bits go yellow.
<H4>The Never Seen Before Clothes Nose</h4>
There is no excuse for anyone not to wear a red nose this year because of the new clothes nose, a classy pin badge. This new product attaches itself to any item of clothing and looks rather lovely.
<H4>Comic Relief's First Serious Song</h4>
The most ambitious music project to date is a special recording of LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE sung by CHER, CHRISSIE HYDE and NENEH CHERRY, featuring ERIC CLAPTON on guitar. It's Comic Relief's first 'serious' single and is produced by Peter Asher. If it doesn't go to Number One, Lenny Henry will eat his next TV series.
<h4>The Comic Relief Screensaver</h4>
A truly original Screensaver, the perfect antidote to Executive Stress.  Say goodbye to that image of goofy goldfish popping up whenever your computer is idle - The Comic Relief Screensaver is excitingly interactive, endlessly changing, and actually witty.  It contains a year's worth of amusement for the office and a busload of prizes.

<h2>What a Difference a Day Made</h2>
Our last Red Nose Day (1993) raised 18.1 million pounds and broke all records for the number of calls attempted during a TV telethon. 4.1 million attempted calls were registered - and our telephone competition hosted by Chris Evans took more calls than any phone competition has done before or since. This year up to 5,000 lines are available to take donations on the night.
<P>
In four Red Nose Days, Comic Relief has raised over 92 million pounds, which has made the difference between hope and despair, self-reliance and poverty and sometimes life and death for thousands of vulnerable people in the UK and Africa.

<p>
<h2>How the Money is Spent</h2>
In the UK we've supported work with older people, and young people who are homeless, disabled or have problems with drugs or alcohol.
<p>
In over 40 countries in Africa we've supported long term development work and, when needed, emergency relief. Most recently our money has paid for land mine awareness education for Rwandan refugees and over £100,000 has been allocated to a Ugandan organisation to provide loans to more than 1,000 small traders who would not qualify for credit from banks. The money is helping them become self-sufficient.

<p>
In all their grant giving we stress the importance of consultation with the people whose needs we are trying to meet. Our aim is that they can become stronger, more confident and self-reliant so that they will no longer need the help of charities like ours.
<p>
Over the years Comic Relief has supported over 2,500 projects. We've supported an army of workers, including drug counsellors, lawyers, health workers, nurses, teachers, engineers, artists, welfare advisers, AIDS counsellors, researchers, writers, builders, pastoralist herders, mechanics, pilots, eye-surgeons, lorry drivers, tailors, seamstresses, vets and entrepreneurs.
<p>
There are Comic Relief funded projects in every county of the UK. So far we've spent nearly £30,000,000 on more than 2,000 grants, which includes enabling accommodation to be provided all over the UK for over 2,000 homeless young people every night.
<p>
Every penny of the money donated by the public has gone to the charity because all our fundraising costs are sponsored in cash or in kind by companies and individuals.

<h2>Ten things you may not know about Comic Relief</h2>
1.  Comic Relief will be 10 years old on Christmas Day, 1995. It was launched on Noel Edmonds' Late Late Breakfast Show live from a refugee camp in Sudan on  December 25, 1985. The single, "Livin' Doll" by Cliff Richard and The Young Ones was released in February 1986. 
<p>
2.  Red Nose Day 10 will be held in the year 2005. By which date Rik Mayall will be 47 and Cliff Richard will be 65 years old. (Currently Red Nose Days are held every two years.)<p>
3.  So far Comic Relief has raised over 92 million pounds. In the last 9 years they have sold 16,739,000 small red plastic noses - all recyclable. 
<p>
4.  The amount of money given by the public that they spend on Fundraising rhymes with Hero and Nero. They get all their fundraising costs sponsored through companies and gifts in kind. In fact, because of interest, more than 100% of the cash given to them goes to charitable projects.
<p>
5.  The last NIGHT OF COMIC RELIEF on BBC1 received more phone calls over the period of the broadcast than any other telethon to date.  
<p>
6.  The total money donated by the end of the television programme is usually doubled and on one occasion was trebled by the time the money stopped coming in.
<p>
7.  Over 72% of people questioned in  a MORI poll after the last Red Nose Day said they had taken part in at least one supporting activity.
<p>
8.  Charity Projects is the name of the charity that set up and organises Comic Relief. All the money raised is allocated to other UK registered charities to fund their projects.
<p>
9.  We love the general public, because without their continued support we just wouldn't be able to carry on the crucial work of helping some of the poorest people at home and in Africa.
<p>
10.  After 9 years in the business, we still don't have any idea how to spell Diaroea and Bikina Farso.

<h1 align=center>Towards International Women's Day</h1>


<ul><li>1857:	On March the 8th, women textile workers went on strike in New York protesting against low wages and poor working conditions.  Allegedly, the event was brutally repressed and ended in violent struggles with police.

<p><li>8th March was commemorated in 1907, again in New York by women textile workers demanding a 10 hour day.  As in 1857, many of the women were arrested. 

<p><li>1908:	US socialist party appointed the Women's National Committee to campaign for the suffrage. On March 8, women workers in the needle trades demonstrated on the Lower East Side of New York for the right to vote and an end to child labour.

<p><li>1909: Following the previous year's event, 1909 marked the First National Women's Day in US.  The day was celebrated by the American Socialist Party annually on the last Sunday of every February so as not to miss a working day.

<p><li>1910: At the International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen, Clara Zetkin, a German Socialist leader and editor of Gleichheit (German Social Democratic Party newspaper) proposed that March 8th be observed annually as International Women's Day.  The idea of the day was to highlight the plight of working class women in a unified, international demonstration and to promote universal suffrage for women.

<p><li>1911: 	After Zetkin's establishment of IWD, more than 1 million women in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland used the day to rally for the right to vote and hold public office, the right to work and to 
vocational training. Celebrations also took place in Russia and China.
   Less than one week later, more than 149 working girls, mainly Italians and Jews, lost their lives in the Triangle Fire in New York City.
The appalling working conditions which led to the disaster were denounced in subsequent celebrations of the IWD.

<p><li>1913/1914:	A demonstration against the outbreak of the First World War was held in St Petersburg on the last Sunday of February in 1913.  Elsewhere in Europe, women used the day to protest against war and violence and to express solidarity with other women internationally.

<p><li>1917:	Following series of strikes by Russian workers against high prices and factory layoffs, on March the 8th (February the 23rd of Russian calendar) women took the streets of St Petersburg.  The protest turned to riots and contributed to the February Revolution which forced the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II.  

<p><li>1922: With Clara Zetkin's help, Lenin established International Women's Day as a Communist holiday. Chinese communists began to celebrate it, too.

<p><li>After 2nd World War: Until the late 1960's the IWD did not receive such a high profile. The reason for this was the Cold War.  With the growth of the Women's Movement, the day came once more into prominence.   

<p><li>1975:	UN International Women's Year.


<p><li>1977: UNESCO proclaimed March the 8th International Women's Day.  

<p>
<li>
The UN Decade for Women (1975-85) encouraged women and women's groups in many countries, including developing ones, to celebrate the Day.
Celebration of IWD became more focused on women's achievements and aspirations.

<b>
Lors de la c&#233;r&#233;monie de signature &#224; Maurice de la Convention
de Lom&#233; IV r&#233;vis&#233;e, le Professeur Jo&#227;o de Deus Pinheiro,
Commissaire responsable du d&#233;veloppement, a prononc&#233; une
allocution dont nous publions ci-dessous les extraits les plus significatifs.
<p>
      Il a notamment, dans ce discours, salu&#233; l'esprit de
coop&#233;ration dont les Etats ACP ont fait preuve tout au long de la
n&#233;gociation de m&ecirc;me que la pers&#233;v&#233;rance de la
pr&#233;sidence fran&#231;aise en vue de la d&#233;termination de l'offre
financi&#232;re de la Communaut&#233; - qui a d&ucirc; &ecirc;tre soumise
&#224; l'arbitrage des Chefs d'Etat et de gouvernements au Sommet de Cannes. 
Avec le recul, le commissaire europ&#233;en consid&#232;re que ce recours au
plus haut niveau t&#233;moigne de l'importance majeure que l'Union
europ&#233;enne accorde &#224; cette dimension de la politique
communautaire.</b>
<P>
Je souhaiterais faire &#233;tat de quelques br&#232;ves r&#233;flexions sur son
contenu, au-del&#224; de la solennit&#233; de l'acte juridique que nous sommes
appel&#233;s &#224; officialiser par notre signature.
<p>
      Je commencerai par une observation qui peut para&icirc;tre une
&#233;vidence, mais qu'il est utile de rappeler pour &#233;viter tout malentendu sur
la signification de ce qui a &#233;t&#233; n&#233;goci&#233; : &#224; savoir que,
la quatri&#232;me Convention ACP-CE ayant &#233;t&#233; conclue pour une
dur&#233;e globale de dix ans, sa r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours ne pouvait
&ecirc;tre confondue avec une ren&#233;gociation int&#233;grale. Seul un nouveau
protocole financier devait obligatoirement &ecirc;tre conclu pour une deuxi&#232;me
p&#233;riode de cinq ans .
<p>
      Dans ce contexte, l'exercice s'est concentr&#233; sur quelques points
essentiels faisant, du reste, l'objet d'une convergence de pr&#233;occupations entre
les partenaires quant &#224; leur choix. Et ceci m&ecirc;me si les modifications ou
compl&#233;ments pr&#233;conis&#233;s par chaque groupe n'allaient pas toujours
dans une direction identique au d&#233;part.
<p>
      Quels enseignements majeurs peut-on d&#232;s lors en tirer quant &#224; la
substance r&#233;sultant du processus de r&#233;vision ? Paradoxalement, le
premier enseignement est sans doute celui de la continuit&#233; si l'on
consid&#232;re le renouvellement du protocole financier: 
<ul>
<li>un accroissement mod&#233;r&#233;, certes - de l'ordre de 22% - des ressources
en &#233;cus mises &#224; la disposition de nos partenaires ACP pour une nouvelle
p&#233;riode de cinq ans;
<p>
<li>un accroissement d&#233;j&#224; beaucoup plus substantiel - 49% - de ces
ressources, si on les &#233;value en dollars, instrument de mesure plus familier pour
la comparaison des aides internationales;
<p>
<li>en tout &#233;tat de cause, un accroissement qui traduit tr&#232;s
concr&#232;tement la volont&#233; de pr&#233;server la relation
privil&#233;gi&#233;e que j'&#233;voquais il y a quelques instants : rare exemple
positif qui contraste singuli&#232;rement avec la tendance g&#233;n&#233;rale au
recul des aides qui pr&#233;vaut aujourd'hui tant sur le plan bilat&#233;ral que sur
le plan multilat&#233;ral.
</ul>
      L'autre enseignement est, &#224; l'inverse, celui de la flexibilit&#233;, qui a
constitu&#233; en quelque sorte l'essence-m&ecirc;me du processus de
r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours. Ce processus a en effet permis des adaptations
aux &#233;volutions constat&#233;es depuis la signature de la Convention en 1989:
<ul>
<li>par un renforcement de la dimension politique de la relation ACP-CE &#224;
travers la perspective de l'&#233;largissement du dialogue politique. Mais aussi et
surtout la volont&#233; de consacrer comme &#233;l&#233;ment essentiel de cette
relation le respect des droits de l'homme, des principes d&#233;mocratiques et de
l'Etat de droit, 
<p>
<li>par un souci d'accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&#233; de la coop&#233;ration en assurant
davantage de coh&#233;rence entre les divers instruments  et en favorisant une
d&#233;marche &#224; la fois souple et performante en ce qui concerne la
programmation, moteur de la mise en oeuvre de l'aide financi&#232;re, 
<p>
<li>par la r&#233;orientation de la dimension &#233;conomique de la
coop&#233;ration vers le d&#233;veloppement du secteur priv&#233; et la recherche
d'une plus grande comp&#233;titivit&#233; des produits ACP, elle-m&ecirc;me
r&#233;v&#233;latrice d'une nouvelle dynamique de l'approche commerciale.
</ul>
<h3>D&#233;fi</h3>

      Telles sont les principales orientations qui r&#233;sultent, &#224; mon sens,
de l'accord que nous allons signer. Mais j'ajoute aussit&ocirc;t que, derri&#232;re ces
orientations, un v&#233;ritable d&#233;fi se dessine : celui de la mise en oeuvre du
8&#232;me FED et de la Convention r&#233;vis&#233;e.
<p>
      C'est un pari d&#233;cisif pour remettre en particulier l'Afrique &#224; l'ordre
du jour de nos priorit&#233;s, non pas comme un continent d'&#233;chec, mais
comme un continent de r&#233;ussite. Une r&#233;ussite elle-m&ecirc;me
d&#233;cisive pour le volume et le profil de notre coop&#233;ration future.
<p>
      Quelles sont, dans cette perspective, les cl&#233;s du succ&#232;s ? Il serait
erron&#233; de les chercher dans un univers &#233;tranger aux acteurs de la
coop&#233;ration eux-m&ecirc;mes.      Du c&ocirc;t&#233; de l'UE, la
d&#233;marche me para&icirc;t command&#233;e par un triple imp&#233;ratif, que
je d&#233;signerai sous le sigle des "3 C" :
<ul>
<li>la coh&#233;rence de l'approche communautaire tant au niveau des
diff&#233;rentes zones g&#233;ographiques o&ugrave; s'applique la politique de
d&#233;veloppement de l'Union qu'au niveau des diff&#233;rentes politiques
communautaires elles-m&ecirc;mes;
<li>la coordination des actions de d&#233;veloppement entre la Communaut&#233;
et les Etats membres, en particulier sur le terrain op&#233;rationnel et dans
diff&#233;rents domaines sectoriels;
<li>la compl&#233;mentarit&#233; entre les politiques de d&#233;veloppement de la
Communaut&#233; et celles des Etats membres.
</ul>
      Du c&ocirc;t&#233; des Etats ACP, l'&#233;l&#233;ment d&#233;terminant
sera leur capacit&#233; &#224; &#233;tablir un bon diagnostic de leur situation et de
leurs besoins. Une telle ma&icirc;trise des facteurs du d&#233;veloppement ne
pourra, du reste, que contribuer &#224; renforcer la coordination entre les donneurs.
Il ne faudrait d'ailleurs pas imaginer que coordination et compl&#233;mentarit&#233;
doivent &ecirc;tre con&#231;ues pour l'usage exclusif de l'UE : elles sont en
r&#233;alit&#233; des pr&#233;mices du dialogue entre les partenaires.
<p>
      C'est dans ces conditions que, me semble-t-il, pourra se mettre en oeuvre une
politique de coop&#233;ration &#233;conomique que je n'h&#233;siterai pas &#224;
qualifier d'"avant-garde", fond&#233;e sur le respect mutuel des partenaires et le
dialogue entre &#233;gaux. La programmation en sera le premier test. Cette politique
exigera en outre une r&#233;elle transparence et une solide capacit&#233;
d'&#233;valuation.
<p>
      C'est &#233;galement dans ce contexte que devront se d&#233;velopper parmi
nos priorit&#233;s les efforts d'int&#233;gration r&#233;gionale et les actions
conjointes tendant &#224; assurer une v&#233;ritable stabilit&#233; socio-politique
&#224; l'int&#233;rieur du continent africain. Sinon, l'incapacit&#233; &#224;
pr&#233;venir les crises risque de compromettre gravement l'avenir du
d&#233;veloppement lui-m&ecirc;me.
<p>
      Enfin, n'oublions pas que le renforcement du tissu productif voulu par les
auteurs de la r&#233;vision de la Convention, y-compris dans sa dimension
r&#233;gionale, constitue un instrument particuli&#232;rement pr&#233;cieux pour
permettre aux ACP d'affronter la concurrence internationale. 
<p>
      Cette consid&#233;ration me para&icirc;t d'autant plus cruciale que la
mondialisation du commerce &#224; laquelle nous assistons repr&#233;sente un
facteur d&#233;terminant de l'&#233;rosion des pr&#233;f&#233;rences. Pour y faire
face, il ne suffit plus de raisonner exclusivement, ni m&ecirc;me principalement, en
termes d'avantages tarifaires. Il faut s'orienter r&#233;solument vers l'utilisation de
tous les instruments susceptibles d'accro&icirc;tre la comp&#233;titivit&#233;  des
productions ACP.
<p>
      Voil&#224; les v&#233;ritables enjeux que comporte la mise en oeuvre de
notre coop&#233;ration dans les quelque cinq ans &#224; venir.
<p>
      Et, puisque j'&#233;voque des &#233;ch&#233;ances, permettez-moi de
terminer par deux consid&#233;rations, l'une pour le court terme, l'autre pour le long
terme. Dans le court terme, il s'agira de se mettre sans tarder &#224; l'heure de la
programmation. N'oublions pas, en effet, qu'une des dispositions que nous avons
amend&#233;es nous prescrit de r&#233;aliser l'exercice de programmation non plus
"dans les meilleures d&#233;lais", d'ici l'entr&#233;e en vigueur de la r&#233;vision -
 mais tr&#232;s concr&#232;tement, dans les douze mois qui suivent la signature de
l'accord de r&#233;vision. En apposant solennellement nos signatures sur ce
document, nous donnerons par cons&#233;quent le signal du d&#233;part &#224; cet
exercice, qui devra ainsi &ecirc;tre men&#233; &#224; bien d'ici d&#233;but
novembre 1996.
<p>
      A plus long terme, il conviendra de pr&#233;parer de fa&#231;on convenable
et cr&#233;dible une nouvelle &#233;ch&#233;ance, qui n'est autre que le
renouvellement de la Convention. Cela nous conduit tout juste au seuil de l'an 2000,
ce qui n'a du long terme que les apparences.
<p>
      Envisager cet autre d&#233;fi, c'est appeler d'ores et d&#233;j&#224; &#224;
une r&#233;flexion en mesure de poser dans les meilleures conditions possibles les
jalons de ce nouveau rendez-vous quinquennal.
<p>
      Pour en revenir &#224; mon propos liminaire, je n'h&#233;siterais pas &#224;
ajouter qu'au fond la vie de la Convention est m&ecirc;me ainsi faite que, quelle que
puisse &ecirc;tre l'importance de l'&#233;tape franchie, ne nous ne nous trouvons
jamais v&#233;ritablement au terme de nos travaux.
<p>
      Il ne s'agit pas pour autant de susciter une comparaison pessimiste avec le
mythe des Dana&iuml;des, condamn&#233;es &#224; remplir inlassablement un
tonneau sans fond. Bien au contraire, je dirais que cet "&#233;ternel retour" est,
d'une certaine fa&#231;on, le symbole-m&ecirc;me du d&#233;veloppement auto-
entretenu.
<p>
      Donnons-nous sans trop tarder les moyens d'une telle r&#233;flexion. La
Commission est, pour sa part, tout &#224; fait dispos&#233;e &#224; relever le
d&#233;fi et &#224; mobiliser &#224; cette fin les &#233;nergies n&#233;cessaires.
<p>
      Elle le fera, je l'affirme d&#232;s aujourd'hui, dans un esprit de large
concertation avec tous les milieux, politiques, &#233;conomiques et sociaux
int&#233;ress&#233;s.
<p>
      Elle le fera aussi, bien entendu, en poursuivant un dialogue constructif avec
ses interlocuteurs privil&#233;gi&#233;s que sont les Etats ACP. Le partenariat reste
plus que jamais le ressort de notre coop&#233;ration et le garant de notre avenir
solidaire. Il n'en devient que plus pr&#233;cieux &#224; pr&#233;server dans un
monde o&ugrave; la concurrence remet trop souvent les interd&#233;pendances en
question.
<p>
      Pour l'heure, nous avons tous &#224; coeur de pouvoir appr&#233;cier au plus
t&ocirc;t la r&#233;ussite d'une Convention que nous avons dot&#233;e de quelques
nouvelles bases. En signant, au nom de la Commission, l'accord qui concr&#233;tise
cette implusion nouvelle, je souhaite tout particuli&#232;rement &#224; nos amis ACP
de parcourir avec succ&#232;s la deuxi&#232;me moiti&#233; du chemin qui
conduira notre marche commune jusqu' &#224; l'or&#233;e du XXI&#232;me
si&#232;cle.

<hr>



What role, if any, can foreign donors play to encourage democracy in Africa south of the Sahara?

Sound political institutions are normally developed at home. If they are imported, they have to be

assimilated into local culture if they are to succeed. On the whole, the recent introduction or

reintroduction of multi-party systems in Africa has not produced economic recovery and it may not

have produced the purely political results which reformers had hoped for. Of paramount importance

in Africa is the way in which foreign and local pressures and interests combine in the formation of

institutions, including the new political institutions of democracy.

<p>

This paper begins with a brief account of democratisation in Africa and will show how it marks both

a rupture and a continuity with older traditions. It then tries to isolate those factors which may not

figure in classical definitions of democracy, but which are important for the success or failure of

democracy as part of a system able to produce stable government, social justice and material

prosperity. We will assess briefly the experience of democratisation of some African countries before

considering what donors have contributed and what actions they might anticipate in the future.

<p>
<I><B>'Determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union
among the peoples of Europe</B></I>
<P>
<B>These were the opening words of the EEC Treaty agreed by the
original six Member States in 1957. The Treaty has been amended
on numerous occasions since then, as the European Communities
have evolved, but this particular provision in the preamble has
remained intact. Indeed, many would argue that it is sacrosanct.
It reflects the desire of the 'founding fathers' for a united
Europe and the practical realisation that this would necessarily
be an evolving process.</B>
<P>
 Since the late 1950s, the development of the EC has consistently
been in line with this goal of 'ever-closer union' even if there
were times when the process seemed to be very slow. The 'six'
have become 15 with perhaps a dozen more countries 'in the pipeline'
at varying stages. The competences of the Community have been
expanded and a single market has been created. Through its judgments,
the European Court of Justice has firmly established the precedence
of EC law. And the Parliament, now directly elected, has been
given real powers.
<P>
 It was planned that 1996 would see another milestone in the process
of European integration with the convening of an Intergovernmental
Conference (IGC) to look primarily at the EU's institutional arrangements.
But while the term  'ever closer union' in the Treaty will almost
certainly not be touched, there are those who wonder whether the
spirit of the preamble will be reflected in the outcome of the
negotiations.
<P>
 The decision to hold an IGC in 1996 was made at the time of the
Maastricht negotiations (Article N of the Treaty on European Union).
The process of ratifying this Treaty, which foresaw, among other
things, the creation of a single European currency, proved more
traumatic than anyone anticipated. It took two referendums in
Denmark to get approval and while France managed it on the first
attempt, the result was agonisingly close. Finally, the project
rested on a knife-edge for several weeks as the British Parliament
debated the bill to implement the Maastricht provisions.
<P>
 The view that the EU's decision-making process needs a fundamental
 overhaul is broadly, though not universally, accepted. The system
was originally designed for a Community of just six countries
and the argument is that it must be streamlined now that there
are fifteen members. Indeed, some people believe it will all but
grind to a halt if and when the Union expands southwards and eastwards.
There have been a number of Treaty changes in the past aimed at
making the system more efficient. Thus, for example, the areas
where a 'qualified majority' rather than 'unanimity' is required
have been expanded. This means in practice that the national 'veto'
has already been curtailed in certain policy areas. At the same
time, the system has become ever-more complex, thanks mainly to
the piecemeal granting of powers to the European Parliament. In
some fields, notably involving the budget, the Parliament is the
central institution whose approval is crucial. In others, Parliament
and Commission can effectively overrule the Council of Ministers.
Overall, the Council retains the key legislative powers, and the
Commission still has the 'power of initiative' but the burgeoning
of legislative procedures makes life increasingly difficult for
all those who work in the system. This inevitably has its effect
on public opinion. Few outsiders understand what happens in 'Brussels',
far less feeling any sense of involvement.
<P>
<a name="com"><h3>The Commission's opinion</h3></a>
<P>
 In adopting its opinion for the IGC (which began in Turin on
March 29), the Commission has tried to take account of these concerns.
It emphasises the 'essential' point that deepening and widening
are intertwined and speaks of the need for a Union which is closer
to its citizens. It also underlines the importance of having 'an
institutional system which will work in an expanded Europe'. And
for this to happen, according to President Santer, the IGC process
has to be backed by a 'clear political will'.
<P>
 The Commission goes on to make a series of concrete recommendations
for the consideration of the IGC (see box). In substantive policy
areas, the focus is on  strengthening the social dimension of
Europe, developing a common employment strategy and giving more
attention to environmental issues. One specific proposal, which
is certain to be resisted in some quarters, is the integration
of the Maastricht Social Protocol into the European Community
Treaty. Readers will recall that the UK 'opted out' of this arrangement
four years ago. In the absence of unanimity among the Member States,
it is difficult to see how this policy area could be formally
incorporated into the main treaty.
<P>
 The Commission also argues for reforms to the justice and home
affairs 'pillar'. This was one of the new fields of common action
agreed in Maastricht, although it was excluded from the European
Community structure, being subject instead to a more traditional
'intergovernmental' process. The key proposal is that this policy
area should be transferred to the Community framework (police
and criminal matters excepted).
<P>
 Given that institutional issues will take centre stage in the
IGC talks, it is not surprising to find that the Commission's
main recommendations are for reforms to the legislative system.
The two main elements of the Commission's opinion in this respect
are the replacement of unanimity by qualified majority voting
as a general rule, and the introduction of streamlined decision-making
(based on just three types of procedure). Significantly, the Commission
also advocates 'pushing forward the subsidiarity principle' and
'involving national parliaments more closely in Union business
by giving them timely access to all information they need'.
<P>
 Overall, the institution makes a plea for simplified procedures
to be introduced throughout the system, and it also suggests a
number of specific changes to the individual institutions. The
latter include improving the operation of the rotating, six-monthly
Council Presidency, reducing the size of the European Commission,
altering the mandate of European Court judges and establishing
an electoral procedure for the Parliament so as to make this body
'as representative as possible.'
<P>
 Finally, a number of proposals are made to 'establish a firmer
basis' for the EU's common foreign and security policy (CFSP)
and move towards a system of common defence. In the field of defence,
it is suggested that the Western European Union's role should
be reviewed 'with a view to incorporating it into the Union'.
<P>
<a name="vis"><h3>Competing visions</h3></a>
<P>
 The Commission's suggestions for the IGC fit in with the 'ever
closer union' ideal, as one would expect from the institution
appointed to act as 'guardian' of the Treaties. At the same time,
they appear to be more evolutionary than revolutionary, being
based on the principle that existing structures must be adapted
for the system to keep functioning rather than on the idea of
dismantling the structure and starting all over again. Despite
this, they contain a number of ideas which are bound to prove
controversial. There is a widespread view that the EU suffers
from a 'democratic deficit' but even a modest enhancement of the
Parliament's role is likely to be resisted in certain national
capitals. The curtailing of the veto is a pragmatic proposal designed
to ensure that the enlarged Union does not find itself paralysed
in future, but it nonetheless touches a raw 'national' nerve in
some Member States. And the idea of a joint approach to defence,
though hardly revolutionary, (many EU countries effectively pool
their 'sovereignty' through NATO) is fiercely resisted by certain
national politicians.
<P>
 The essential problem is that there are competing and apparently
irreconcilable visions of what the European Union ought to be.
Should it continue moving towards ever-closer union. If it does,
it is difficult to see how this could happen without the emergence
of some sort of federal system - although many  advocates of integration
prefer to avoid using this term for fear of a 'Eurosceptic' backlash.
Should it revert to a more traditional intergovernmental structure.
The 'Europe of Nations' idea has been gaining ground in some Member
States and is now being actively canvassed, despite the fact that
it appears to contradict the Treaty preamble to which all Members
are notionally committed. A third possibility is that the system
should remain largely unchanged. 'Thus far and no further' is
a refrain heard in certain quarters although there is a counter-argument
that without dynamic development, the structure cannot endure.
As lawyers are fond of pointing out, the European Community is
<I>sui generis </I>and there are those who see it as perched on
a tightrope somewhere between an international organisation and
a state in its own right. If this analogy is correct, then immobility
does not appear to be an option. Some momentum (whether forwards
or backwards) would appear to be required.
<P>
  The Commission, which is participating in the IGC but does not
have a vote, is not the only body to have set out its stall in
advance of the Conference. The key actors in this particular process
are obviously the Member States and they too have been producing
position papers which underline the diversity of views about where
the EU ought to be headed. A lot of hard bargaining lies ahead
and commentators are suggesting that the IGC process could last
up to a year (although not in continuous session). At present,
it is difficult to see how the all the discordant voices can be
brought together in harmony. But as <I>The Courier</I> has observed
before, the Union has a remarkable capacity for achieving compromises
between ostensibly irreconcilable positions.
<P>
 One possible outcome is that the IGC will result in a more multi-layered
system with Member States choosing whether or not to participate
in certain aspects of the integration process. The Commission
expressly rejects the idea of an <I>'&agrave; la carte'</I> approach
but acknowledges that flexibility may be needed. The possibility
for some Member States to integrate in certain areas within the
EU framework is acknowledged although the Commission believes
that other countries must be free to join such arrangements later
'if they are willing and able.' At a wider European level, a multi-layered
approach has long existed with various  bodies having different
and often overlapping memberships (the EU, the Council of Europe,
the Western European Union, the Schengen group of countries etc.)
<P>
However, within the European Community set-up, the approach prior
to 1992 was based on universal application of the rules. Under
the Maastricht Treaty, Britain and Denmark gained opt-outs from
the single European currency and it is recognised that even if
the timetable is met for the introduction of the <I>Euro</I>,
several other Member States are unlikely to take part from the
outset. Also, as mentioned earlier, the UK does not adhere to
the Social Protocol. There are people who see these as cracks
in the edifice which could ultimately threaten the construction
of Europe. But, in the final analysis, this type of arrangement
may offer the only realistic way of staying on the path to 'ever-closer
union'.

<P>
<B>Que ce soit dans le cadre de ses dossiers ou de ses reportages, le
Courrier a abord&#233; de fa&#231;on r&#233;guli&#232;re - et approfondie -
le th&#232;me des investissements communautaires dans le
d&#233;veloppement des ressources humaines (sant&#233;, nutrition et
&#233;ducation) des pays ACP. Cet article se veut un bilan rapide de la
politique de l'UE en mati&#232;re d'&#233;ducation et de formation au fil des
Conventions de Yaound&#233; et de Lom&#233;.</b>
<p>
     L'&#233;ducation pour tous : une affirmation qui va beaucoup plus loin
qu'un slogan. Car s'il y a certains avantages &#224; court terme &#224; offrir,
dans un pays en d&#233;veloppement particuli&#232;rement pauvre, un
enseignement et une formation professionnelle de qualit&#233; sup&#233;rieure
&#224; quelques privil&#233;gi&#233;s, le "miracle asiatique" a n&#233;anmoins
prouv&#233; que seul un niveau suffisant d'&#233;ducation de l'ensemble de la
population permet de r&#233;els progr&#232;s sur la voie du d&#233;veloppement
et de la prosp&#233;rit&#233; &#224; long terme.
<p>
     Quel est donc le probl&#232;me? Dans de tr&#232;s nombreux pays, en
Afrique subsaharienne en particulier, un pourcentage important d'enfants ne
b&#233;n&#233;ficient d'aucun enseignement du tout. Parmi ceux qui sont
scolaris&#233;s, peu d'enfants tirent un r&#233;el profit de leur enseignement en
raison de la tr&#232;s faible qualit&#233; de celui-ci. Seule une infime
minorit&#233; parviendra au niveau secondaire. Or la proportion des budgets
nationaux affect&#233;s au secteur &#233;ducatif n'a jamais &#233;t&#233; aussi
&#233;lev&#233;e.
<p>
     L'urgence du probl&#232;me na&icirc;t du temps qu'il faudra pour le
r&#233;soudre. M&ecirc;me si l'on pouvait, d'un coup de baguette magique,
assurer un bon enseignement primaire &#224; tous les enfants, les effets positifs
n'en seraient pas visibles avant une dizaine d'ann&#233;es.
<p>
     Quelle est la contribution de l'aide europ&#233;enne &#224; la solution de
ce probl&#232;me ? Quels principes directeurs ont r&#233;gi l'octroi de cette aide
jusqu'ici ? Et pourquoi le probl&#232;me reste-t-il aussi aigu, en Afrique
subsahrienne notamment, alors que l'Europe investit depuis plusieurs dizaines
ann&#233;es dans l'aide &#224; l'&#233;ducation ?
<p>
<H3>L'aide &#224; l'&#233;ducation: un miroir de l'&#233;volution du secteur</H3>
<p>
     L'aide &#224; l'&#233;ducation refl&#232;te les &#233;volutions intervenues
dans le secteur &#233;ducatif des pays concern&#233;s. Ainsi, par exemple, les
pays africains &#224; bas revenu - qui repr&#233;sentent 73 % de la population
du continent - ont connu une expansion rapide de leurs syst&#232;mes
&#233;ducatifs, puis une chute verticale du financement qui n'a pas manqu&#233;
d'entra&icirc;ner une baisse notoire des normes d'enseignement. Apr&#232;s avoir
affect&#233; son financement &#224; des actions ponctuelles en mati&#232;re
d'infrastructure et de ressources humaines, l'aide europ&#233;enne a
abord&#233; les probl&#232;mes urgents dans le cadre d'une "approche-projet"
avant d'adopter une approche sectorielle coordonn&#233;e visant &#224; la
r&#233;forme globale des syst&#232;mes d'enseignement.
<p>
     Entre 1970 et 1980, le nombre d'&#233;l&#232;ves inscrits dans les
&#233;coles primaires de pays en d&#233;veloppement a plus que doubl&#233;,
et celui des &#233;l&#232;ves du secondaire et du tertiaire a quadrupl&#233;.
M&ecirc;me si l'on tient compte de la pouss&#233;e d&#233;mographique, le
pourcentage d'enfants en &#226;ge d'enseignement primaire scolaris&#233;s a
augment&#233; de 90 %, et la proportion de filles s'est sensiblement accrue.
Cette augmentation s'est accompagn&#233;e d'un doublement des ressources
budg&#233;taires octroy&#233;es au secteur par l'Etat.
<p>
     Au cours de la r&#233;cession &#233;conomique g&#233;n&#233;rale de
1980-1985, les fonds publics attribu&#233;s &#224; l'&#233;ducation ont
baiss&#233; de 40 % - or les syst&#232;mes &#233;ducatifs n'ont cess&#233; de
prendre de l'extension. Cette situation a entra&icirc;n&#233; l'effondrement du
salaire des enseignants et la suppression quasi-absolue des frais de
fonctionnement non salariaux tels que le mat&#233;riel p&#233;dagogique et
l'entretien des b&#226;timents.
<p>
     La situation financi&#232;re s'est quelque peu redress&#233;e depuis 1985,
et l'apport financier est remont&#233; &#224; un niveau jamais &#233;gal&#233;.
Pourtant de nombreux Etats africains connaissent une crise de l'enseignement :
les b&#226;timents se d&#233;gradent et sont inadapt&#233;s ; les enseignants,
qui n'ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; que d'une formation r&#233;duite (voire nulle),
sont souvent absents en raison du faible niveau des incitations et du manque de
surveillance. Les livres scolaires et autres formes de mat&#233;riel didactique font
cruellement d&#233;faut. Beaucoup d'&#233;l&#232;ves sortent donc de
l'&#233;cole en ne sachant pratiquement ni lire ni compter. En raison de cette
faible qualit&#233; de l'instruction, conjugu&#233;e &#224; un accroissement des
frais qu'ils doivent assumer, de nombreux parents ne se soucient plus d'envoyer
leurs enfants &#224; l'&#233;cole - m&ecirc;me si des places y sont disponibles.
Le taux de scolarisation a baiss&#233; de 10 % environ dans le primaire entre
1990 et 1992. Une r&#233;forme fondamentale du secteur appara&icirc;t donc,
dans de nombreux pays, comme la seule solution.
<p>
<H3>L'&#233;volution de l'aide</H3>
<p>
     Aux premiers jours de l'aide europ&#233;enne, le secteur de
l'&#233;ducation et de la formation &#233;tait per&#231;u comme le fournisseur
d'une main-d'oeuvre qui allait contribuer &#224; la modernisation des
&#233;conomies nationales. Les th&#232;mes prioritaires de la Convention de
Yaound&#233; consacr&#233;e &#224; l'aide communautaire ont &#233;t&#233;
l'industrialisation, la coop&#233;ration r&#233;gionale et le commerce
international. L'assistance &#224; l'&#233;ducation et la formation professionnelle
portaient essentiellement sur la construction de coll&#232;ges et de facult&#233;s
universitaires au titre de soutien au processus d'industrialisation et de
coop&#233;ration r&#233;gionale.
<p>
     La Convention de Lom&#233; I, sign&#233;e en 1975, parle
sp&#233;cifiquement de la cr&#233;ation d'instituts r&#233;gionaux de
technologies avanc&#233;es permettant aux ressortissants de participer
pleinement au d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique au travers de programmes
de formation.
<p>
     La Convention de Lom&#233; II, sign&#233;e en 1980, introduit le concept
de programmes de formation pluriannuels ainsi que les formes suivantes de
soutien : bourses et cours/s&#233;minaires ; experts et instructeurs ;
mat&#233;riel p&#233;dagogique ; collaboration entre les instituts de formation ou
de recherche et les universit&#233;. L'accent reste donc mis sur une formation
professionnelle &#224; l'intention d'autres secteurs.
<p>
     Un pourcentage significatif de l'aide bilat&#233;rale europ&#233;enne dans
le domaine de l'&#233;ducation et de la formation s'est concr&#233;tis&#233; par
l'envoi d'enseignants dans les &#233;coles secondaires, les coll&#232;ges et les
universit&#233;s. Ces enseignants europ&#233;ens ont permis de rem&#233;dier
partiellement &#224; la p&#233;nurie de coll&#232;gues form&#233;s localement
tout en dispensant un enseignement &#224; une &#233;lite capable d'assumer
des fonctions de cadres moyens et sup&#233;rieurs dans le secteur public comme
dans le priv&#233;.
<p>
     En 1985, les probl&#232;mes pos&#233;s par  les syst&#232;mes
&#233;ducatifs financ&#233;s &#233;taient devenus flagrants et, comme dans les
autres secteurs, une "approche-projet" a &#233;t&#233; adopt&#233;e pour tenter
de les r&#233;soudre. C'est ainsi que la Convention de Lom&#233; III
pr&#233;voit une aide &#224; l'&#233;ducation et  &#224; la formation sous la
forme de programmes int&#233;gr&#233;s visant un objectif pr&#233;cis -
l'id&#233;e &#233;tant, par exemple, de soutenir les efforts d&#233;ploy&#233;s
par les Etats ACP eux-m&ecirc;mes aux fins de restructurer leurs institutions et
syst&#232;mes d'&#233;ducatifs pour en r&#233;nover le contenu, les
m&#233;thodes p&#233;dagogiques et les technologies en vue d'accro&icirc;tre
leur efficacit&#233; et de r&#233;duire le co&ucirc;t des diff&#233;rents types de
formation. La Convention traduit &#233;galement la pr&#233;occupation
suscit&#233;e par les sous-repr&#233;sentation de certains groupes, et des
femmes en particulier.
<p>
     En 1990, l'investissement dans les ressources humaines au travers de
l'&#233;ducation et de la formation &#233;tait devenu une priorit&#233; pour les
donateurs, parall&#232;lement &#224; la prise de conscience d'une
n&#233;cessit&#233; de r&#233;forme sectorielle. Aux termes de la Convention
Lom&#233; IV de 1989 : "La coop&#233;ration vise &#224; appuyer un
d&#233;veloppement des Etats ACP centr&#233; sur l'homme et enracin&#233;
dans la culture de chaque peuple. Elle appuie les politiques et mesures prises par
ces Etats en vue de valoriser leurs ressources humaines, d'accro&icirc;tre leurs
capacit&#233;s propres de cr&#233;ation et de promouvoir leur identit&#233;s
culturelles. Elle favorise la participation des populations &#224; la conception et
&#224; la mise en oeuvre du d&#233;veloppement". Dans le chapitre intitul&#233;
"Actions de valorisation des ressources humaines", l'article consacr&#233; &#224;
l'&#233;ducation et la formation parle d'apporter un soutien aux efforts des Etats
ACP pour "r&#233;former leurs &#233;tablissements et syst&#232;mes
d'enseignement de base, notamment par la g&#233;n&#233;ralisation de
l'enseignement primaire et l'adaptation des syst&#232;mes import&#233;s et pour
les int&#233;grer dans les strat&#233;gies de d&#233;veloppement".
<p>
     A la fin des ann&#233;es 1980 et au d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 1990,
les diff&#233;rents Etats europ&#233;ens et la Communaut&#233; ont rejoint la
Banque mondiale dans son appui &#224; l'ajustemement structurel. En 1991, le
Commission europ&#233;enne d&#233;clarait dans une communication &#224;
l'intention du Conseil europ&#233;en D&#233;veloppement qu'elle donnerait la
priorit&#233; absolue &#224; la dimension sociale de l'ajustement en veillant
notamment &#224; ce que les secteurs de la sant&#233; et de l'&#233;ducation
b&#233;n&#233;ficient d'une attention suffisante conjointement aux r&#233;formes
instaur&#233;es ou pr&#233;vues dans ces deux domaines.
<p>
     La coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e a pris toute son importance
dans l'&#233;tude de cette r&#233;forme du syst&#232;me. Les
micror&#233;alisations en co&ucirc;ts partag&#233;s en vue du
d&#233;veloppement local, initi&#233;es par Lom&#233; I avec mention explicite
d'une aide aux &#233;coles primaires, en fournissent un exemple. La
n&#233;cessit&#233; de soutenir les activit&#233;s des organisations non
gouvernementales en est un autre.
<p>
<H3>Une approche nouvelle</H3>
<p>
     Deux &#233;v&#232;nements intervenus au d&#233;but des ann&#233;es
1990 ont influenc&#233; de mani&#232;re d&#233;terminante l'aide
europ&#233;enne en mati&#232;re d'&#233;ducation et de formation. Le premier a
&#233;t&#233; la Conf&#233;rence mondiale "Education pour tous : une
r&#233;ponse aux besoins fondamentaux d'apprentissage" tenue &#224; Jomtien
en 1990. En insistant pour que l'&#233;ducation primaire
g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e et l'alphab&#233;tisation des adultes deviennent des
priorit&#233;s politiques, cette r&#233;union a provoqu&#233; une
r&#233;orientation majeure de l'aide puisque les donateurs ont r&#233;duit les
ressources traditionnellement attribu&#233;es &#224; l'enseignement
sup&#233;rieur pour en affecter davantage &#224; l'enseignement primaire. Le
second &#233;v&#232;nement important a &#233;t&#233;  le Trait&#233; de 1992
sur l'Union europ&#233;enne qui exige la coordination des politiques et des
actions des Etats membres, surtout dans les secteurs sociaux. Les principes
directeurs figurent dans la R&#233;solution du Conseil de 1994 sur l'aide &#224;
l'&#233;ducation et &#224; la formation dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement,
dans laquelle le Conseil souligne que l'&#233;ducation, et l'&#233;ducation de
base en particulier, est un droit fondamental.
<p>
     Aux termes de la R&#233;solution, la priorit&#233; pour la
Communaut&#233; et ses Etats membres est double : maximiser l'acc&#232;s
&#224; l'&#233;ducation dans les limites des ressources disponibles et veiller
&#224; ce que la qualit&#233; de l'enseignement r&#233;ponde aux besoins de la
majorit&#233; des &#233;l&#232;ves. Cet objectif doit &ecirc;tre atteint au moyen
d'une strat&#233;gie &#233;quilibr&#233;e, fond&#233;e sur un programme et
adapt&#233;e &#224; la situation particuli&#232;re du pays en
d&#233;veloppement concern&#233; - un accent tout particulier &#233;tant mis
sur l'&#233;ducation de base. L'aide doit viser &#224; soutenir les politiques et
efforts d&#233;ploy&#233;s par les pays en d&#233;veloppement eux-
m&ecirc;mes et ne pas se substituer &#224; l'initiative locale. Elle doit veiller
&#224; une meilleure int&#233;gration des actions men&#233;es dans le cadre de
l'ajustement structurel avec les priorit&#233;s du secteur de l'&#233;ducation et
l'assistance dont il b&#233;n&#233;ficie d&#233;j&#224;.
<p>
     L'aide communautaire &#224; l'&#233;ducation et &#224; la formation dans
les pays d'Afrique, des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique s'est voulue, d&#232;s le
d&#233;part, une r&#233;ponse aux demandes formul&#233;es par les Etats ACP
avec une insistance particuli&#232;re sur l'appropriation par les Etats en question
des programmes mis en place. L'&#233;l&#233;ment nouveau de l'approche
actuelle est l'instauration d'un dialogue entre le gouvernement et l'ensemble des
donateurs sur les besoins, les priorit&#233;s et les strat&#233;gies replac&#233;s
dans le contexte g&#233;n&#233;ral du secteur de l'&#233;ducation. Seule une
approche globale permettra en effet aux pays en d&#233;veloppement et aux
Etats europ&#233;ens d'&#233;tablir un v&#233;ritable partenariat en vue de
r&#233;pondre aux besoins d'&#233;ducation et de formation de tous les
citoyens - dont d&#233;pend l'avenir m&ecirc;me de ces pays.

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Why it was unnecessary to drop the Bomb</title>

<center><h2>Why the atom bomb wasn't necessary to end the war</h2></center>


<h3>By Janet Bloomfield, Chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</h3>
<font size=-1> <br>The Atomic Bomb Dome, seen from a former shopping centre 400 metres away.  Smoke and heat rise from the ruins, but not a living thing moves.  August 7 1945, about noon, Hiroshima.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Photo ©: <a href="../gallery/hiroshima/hiroshima_top.html">World Conference Against A and H Bombs</a></font><br clear=left>


<b>I believe that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when considered in a historical perspective, were undoubtedly unnecessary and barbarous acts. Those who support this view include Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery and General Dwight Eisenhower. I would ask the following questions of those who still support the bombings:</b><p>


<ul><li>Why was there no demonstration explosion in an uninhabited area to convince the Japanese of the awesome power of the bomb? <p>


<li>Why was it necessary to bomb two cities? </ul><p>


During the pause for thought that these questions invoke I will use the words of others, involved at the time, as well as evidence that has come to light since, which prove that:<p>

 <b>"Japan was at that very moment seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of 'face'... It wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing." (General Eisenhower).</b><p>
 

First, let us stop for a minute and remember the impact of the atomic bombs.<p>


<b>The uranium bomb exploded over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and the plutonium bomb used on Nagasaki on 9 August killed tens of thousands instantly and had claimed 350,000 lives by 1950. Those not killed or vaporised immediately by the blast were horribly burned by the intense heat of the explosion. Eye-witness accounts describe traumatised people wandering with their skin trailing from their bodies 'like walking ghosts'. All recorded pregnancies within a two-mile radius of the centre of the blast resulted in miscarriage or stillbirth. Even today, survivors live with the fear that they may be struck down by a radiation-related disease. </b><p>


We now know that the allies were aware by May 1945 that the Japanese were attempting to make contact in order to negotiate a surrender and that Japan was being overcome by conventional might. According to Admiral William D. Leahy, Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and President Truman's Chief of Staff:<p>


<b>"The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... In being the first to use it [the atomic bomb], we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages." </b><p>


<li><b>April:</b> General Curtis le May (US Air Force) expressed a belief that the war could be ended by September or October without an invasion. <p>


<li><b>May 12:</b> William Donovan, Director of the Office of Strategic Studies, reported to President Truman that Shuichi Kate, Japan's Minister to Switzerland, wished to "help arrange for a cessation of hostilities." <p>


<li><b>Mid-June:</b> "A surrender of Japan can be arranged with terms that can be accepted by Japan and that will make fully satisfactory provision for America's defense against future trans-Pacific aggression." Admiral W.D. Leahy, President's Chief of Staff.<p>


<li><b>July 16:</b> The US exploded a nuclear bomb secrety in the New Mexico desert to prove to themselves that it would work. <p>


<li><b>July 18:</b> Stalin told Truman that he had had a telegram from the Japanese Emperor himself asking for peace. Code-breakers were already aware of this. The Soviet Union was still officially neutral at that time. <p>


<li><b>August 10:</b> The Japanese publicly broadcast an offer of surrender. Truman ordered conventional military operations to continue full force. <p>


<li><b>August 14:</b> The Japanese surrender was accepted. <p>


<b>"It would be a mistake to suppose that the fate of Japan was settled by the atomic bomb. Her defeat was certain before the first bomb fell." (UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill.)</b><p>


<b>"Certainly prior to 31 December 1945... Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated." (US Strategic Bombing Survey, 1946.)</b><p>


If Japan was ready to surrender, there must have been another reason for the atom bombs to have been used. This, unbelievable as it might seem, was to make a point to the Soviet Union.<p>


Vannevar Bush (Chief Aide for atomic matters to Stimson, the Secretary of State for War) confirmed this when he said that the bomb was: "delivered on time so there was no necessity for any concessions to Russia at the end of the war."<p>


The US did not want the Soviet Union to be involved in the anticipated 'last push' land invasion of Northern China, since this would put it in a good position to exert influence in the area once hostilities ceased. The US therefore attempted to end the fighting before the Red Army entered Chinese territory but did not accept Japanese moves to surrender, leaving President Truman confident about finishing the war in the Far East with as little help from Russia as possible.<p>


Truman postponed meeting Churchill and Stalin to discuss post-war territorial control until after July 16, when the first ever atomic explosion took place as the US tested its new weapon in New Mexico. Truman went to Potsdam, Germany, the very next day buoyed by the conviction that he had a weapon which would, as predicted by his Secretary of State, James Byrnes, "make Russia more manageable in Europe." <p>


The Hiroshima bomb was dropped on 6 August. The message to the Japanese must have been unmistakable and it is difficult to imagine why a second one should have been used on August 9. Except that the Soviet Union was due to enter the war in that week and the US wanted to demonstrate to the Soviets the awesome power that they would be dealing with once the war was over. <p>


In part because he wanted to wait until the bomb was ready, President Truman ignored advice in May 1945 from Acting Secretary of State Grew that changing the surrender terms might well halt the fighting. Some came to believe that this actually cost lives. Stimson, Secretary of State for War, said: "History might find that the US, by its delay in stating its position, had prolonged the war."<p>


It is clear that 50 years on, the existing mythology must be questioned and a more sober assessment of the facts is needed. The need for this has been brought sharply into focus by the latest twist in the arms race. <p>

<b>For the past few years there has been a general impression that there is no longer a nuclear threat. This, alas, is far from the truth. Whilst the US and Russia take tentative steps towards a build-down, France, China and the UK are increasing their arsenals. The British Government has stated that the new Trident nuclear warheads will be used for targeting non-nuclear states. The French decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific in September threatens to unleash a new wave of nuclear proliferation, since the only reason to test is to develop new nuclear weapons. It may cause the breakdown of talks in Geneva towards a complete nuclear test ban, an important step on the road to disarmament. </b><p>
<hr width=71%><p>


<font size=-1><b>All those who suffered in the war were victims of a world gone mad. CND is working to make sure that the nuclear madness is reversed and that the nuclear weapon states honour their international commitment to nuclear disarmament, reaffirmed in May at the UN.</b> <p>

To support CND's campaign to stop further French nuclear tests, get nuclear warheads off Britain's roads and stop the Government spending 3m per day on nuclear weapons, contact us on + 44 (0)171 700 2393 or write to me at 162 Holloway Rd, London N7 8DQ. </font><p>

<title>NI History of UN - Dec 94</title>
<!!keys: New Internationalist+History+Hammarskjold+Thant+Waldheim+Perez de Cuellar+Boutros-Ghali>
</head>
<h2>New Internationalist: History Of The UN</h2>
<i>The material that follows has been provided by </i><a href="NIinfo.html">New Internationalist</a>
<hr>

<h3>Heroes and villains</h3>
<i>The UN is only as effective as governments of the day allow it
to be. But it still needs good leadership. Here the <b>NI</b> looks
back on the six Secretaries-General, from the visionary to the
sheep, the campaigner to the crook.</i>
<p>
<b>Trygve Lie (Norway) 1946-52</b> 
The first Secretary-General (SG) was by far the most outspoken.
His strength reflected the high hopes of the time for the new
international organization in the aftermath of a devastating
war. But Lie's readiness to wade in with his own opinions on any
and every world issue had mixed  results. In supporting (in
vain) Communist China's right to take its seat at the UN after
the 1949 Revolution he was admirably clear-sighted and prepared
to stand up to the US. But ultimately his passionate advocacy of
the US/UN position in the Korean War won him the enmity of the
Soviet Union, who refused to take part in UN activities when he
was present, forcing him to resign.
<p>
<b>Dag Hammarskjold (Sweden) 1953-61</b>
Hammarskjold was the UN's finest leader. More carefully
diplomatic than Lie, he was just as prepared to take independent
initiatives and not simply serve the major powers. He behaved
with credit during the Suez Crisis, when two of the
veto-holders, Britain and France were clearly at fault. And he
was largely responsible for the whole idea of peacekeeping,
which is not provided for in the UN Charter - the first UN
peacekeeping force was deployed in Egypt in 1956. The perils of
peacekeeping were soon evident during his intervention in the
civil war following the Belgian Congo's independence in 1960.
The UN soon found itself 'taking sides' and imposing 'peace'
through military force. The intervention also cost Hammarskjold
his life - he died in a suspicious plane crash in Northern
Rhodesia while on his way to meet secessionist rebels. His Congo
policy incurred the wrath of the Soviet Union. Hammarskjld's
idealistic response was that he was there to serve the interests
not of the great powers but of the small states.
<p>
<b>U Thant (Burma) 1961-71</b>
The major powers now informally agreed that no future Secretary
General should have the power and presence of Hammarskjold. U
Thant was the first fruit of that change of policy, being quiet
and bureaucratically inclined, almost never speaking at Security
Council meetings. He presided over 10 further years of Cold War,
years in which the UN was frozen into immobility on the
peace-and-security front. But these were also the years in which
newly independent countries of the South joined the organization
in droves, full of hope that they could harness it in the cause
of global justice and equality. The presence of a leader from
the South symbolized that new phase for the UN, as did U Thant's
own most daring initiative - his repeated and passionate
criticism of the US war in Vietnam.
<p>
<b>Kurt Waldheim (Austria) 1972-81</b>
Waldheim will be remembered less for his work at the UN than for the accusations of involvement in Nazi war crimes which dogged his later career as President of Austria. He was arguably the least distinguished of all the UN's leaders. Publicly
diplomatic, even obsequious to the major powers, in private he
was vain, with a violent temper. During his term the UN
Secretariat lapsed in standards as the quality of senior staff
was continually diluted by backscratching 'political'
appointments and hints of corruption - staff morale in New York
sank ever lower.
<p>
<b>Javier Perez de Cuellar (Peru) 1982-91</b>
Perez de Cuellar, a sensitive, soft-spoken aesthete, was bored
stiff by budget discussions, which notoriously sent him to
sleep. The perilous financial basis of the UN, forever dependent
on an increasingly hostile US, was never likely to be turned
around in his term of office. And it may also be no coincidence
that during his decade the World Bank and the IMF - UN
organizations both - started to set the global economic agenda,
thereby undermining the UN's humanitarian development work.
Perez de Cuellar concentrated instead on the 'good offices'
function of the Secretary-General - the power to act as an
independent mediator in international disputes - and achieved
some success in later years in this role, most notably in El
Salvador.
<p>
<b>Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) 1992</b>
Boutros-Ghali is the most forceful UN leader since Hammarskjold,
as 'hands on' as Perez de Cuellar was 'hands off'. Staff in New
York have already been shaken up by his reorganizations and he
may pay more attention than his predecessors to the nitty-gritty
internal reforms which are so badly needed. But he would never
have been appointed had he not been considered 'sound' by the
newly dominant Western powers on the key issue of the global
free market. His use of the UN's post-Cold War freedom of
manoeuvre has been generally disastrous, as in Somalia and
Rwanda. He does seem to recognize that the world is going to be
ever more war-torn if the basic needs of the poor are not met.
If his concern were serious he would lead a campaign to bring
the World Bank and the IMF to heel, starting perhaps at the
Social Summit in Copenhagen. But don't hold your breath.

Les effets de la corruption sur le d&eacute;veloppement</h2>

<H4>par <i>Dieter Frisch</i></H4>
<h4>Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>le Courrier ACP-UE</i><br>no. 158,
juillet-ao&#251;t 1996: pages 68 - 70</h4>
<h5>(N.B.: Ce texte peut diverger quelque peu de la version originale)

<hr><p><b>
La corruption - d&eacute;finie comme &quot;abus de pouvoir public
&agrave; des fins personnelles&quot; - a toujours exist&eacute;.
Mais au cours des derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, elle s'est
&eacute;tendue g&eacute;ographiquement et s'est amplifi&eacute;e
en intensit&eacute;. Depuis le milieu des ann&eacute;es 70, elle
a atteint la quasi-totalit&eacute; des pays du monde. </b>
<P>
On pouvait esp&eacute;rer que la lib&eacute;ralisation politique
et &eacute;conomique, qui marque les ann&eacute;es 90 depuis la
fin de la Guerre froide, r&eacute;duirait ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne.
Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la transparence accrue issue du pluralisme
politique et la libert&eacute; de la presse, le processus de d&eacute;mocratisation
devrait normalement mobiliser des forces contre la corruption.
Mais les jeunes d&eacute;mocraties restent fragiles et ont apparemment
du mal &agrave; s'attaquer aux int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;tablis.

<P>
Pour sa part, la lib&eacute;ralisation &eacute;conomique - en
r&eacute;duisant les interventions &eacute;tatiques et, partant,
les occasions de corruption - devrait, elle aussi, l'att&eacute;nuer.
Or, dans le court terme, nous observons plut&ocirc;t le contraire
: des structures d'Etat affaiblies, l'absence d'une l&eacute;gislation
ad&eacute;quate, l'insuffisante capacit&eacute; de l'appareil
judiciaire &agrave; s'attaquer &agrave; la corruption, la recherche
du gain facile - que d'aucuns confondent avec l'&eacute;conomie
de march&eacute; !- concourent toutes &agrave; aggraver le ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne,
du moins dans une phase de transition. Cette &eacute;volution
ne peut laisser indiff&eacute;rents ceux qui s'occupent et se
pr&eacute;occupent du d&eacute;veloppement. 
<P>
Certes, on peut aborder la corruption et ses effets sous diff&eacute;rents
angles. On peut le faire par le biais &eacute;thique. Mais alors
qu'est-ce qui nous autorise &agrave; pr&ecirc;cher la morale au
Sud et &agrave; l'Est, alors que la corruption s&eacute;vit aussi
au Nord et que, s'agissant de corruption dans les relations &eacute;conomiques
internationales, il y a, presque par d&eacute;finition, un corrupteur
au Nord et un corrompu au Sud et &agrave; l'Est ? La seule r&eacute;ponse
- moralement contestable mais &eacute;conomiquement correcte -
serait que le Nord riche peut se permettre de gaspiller une partie
de ses ressources alors que, dans les PVD, les rares ressources
doivent &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on optimale !
D'autres mettent en exergue les distorsions que la corruption
provoque dans le jeu loyal des conditions de concurrence, en d&eacute;favorisant
les entreprises performantes, mais honn&ecirc;tes.
<P>
<H3>Un obstacle majeur au d&eacute;veloppement </H3>
<P>
Pour ma part, je l'aborderai quant &agrave; ses effets sur le
d&eacute;veloppement. En effet, une longue exp&eacute;rience professionnelle
m'am&egrave;ne &agrave; conclure que la corruption est un des
obstacles majeurs au d&eacute;veloppement, que ses effets sur
le d&eacute;veloppement sont d&eacute;sastreux. 
<P>
Certains opposeront &agrave; cette affirmation l'argument &quot;culturel&quot;
qui veut faire croire que, dans certaines cultures, la corruption
serait usuelle et moralement accept&eacute;e. Or, nulle part au
monde, l'enrichissement par la corruption n'est licite ou moralement
admis ! Je citerai &agrave; ce sujet Olusegun Obansanjo, l'ancien
pr&eacute;sident du Nig&eacute;ria : &quot;Dans la conception
africaine de l'estime et de l'hospitalit&eacute;, un don est un
symbole, un signe. Sa valeur est dans l'esprit de donner, non
dans sa valeur mat&eacute;rielle. Le don est fait ouvertement,
jamais dans le secret, pour que tous le voient. Lorsqu'un don
est excessif, il suscite de l'embarras et est m&ecirc;me rendu
au donneur. La corruption a perverti les aspects positifs de cette
vieille tradition&quot;. 
<P>
Ensuite, il y a les cyniques - et parmi eux des professeurs r&eacute;put&eacute;s
- qui pr&eacute;tendent que la corruption graisse la machine du
d&eacute;veloppement et la fait fonctionner. Encore convient-il,
&agrave; cet &eacute;gard, tout aspect &eacute;thique &agrave;
nouveau mis &agrave; part, de distinguer entre le petit bakchich
qui peut acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer certaines proc&eacute;dures administratives
(&quot;acceleration fees&quot;) et la grande corruption qui, elle,
pervertit le processus de d&eacute;veloppement. Sans sous-estimer
pour autant l'effet destructeur, m&ecirc;me de la petite corruption,
sur la soci&eacute;t&eacute; ! 
<P>
D'autres encore sont r&eacute;sign&eacute;s. Pour eux, la corruption
est intrins&egrave;quement li&eacute;e au sous-d&eacute;veloppement
: aussi longtemps que des revenus normaux ne permettent pas de
vivre d&eacute;cemment, toutes les portes lui seraient ouvertes.
C'est donc par le d&eacute;veloppement qu'il faudrait s'attaquer
&agrave; la corruption. Cela rappelle le d&eacute;bat sur l'explosion
d&eacute;mographique : c'est par le d&eacute;veloppement, disent
certains, qu'on r&eacute;soudra le probl&egrave;me de la croissance
de la population. Mais d'ici l&agrave;, la plan&egrave;te sera
inexorablement surpeupl&eacute;e ! Ce m&ecirc;me argument me para&icirc;t
valoir pour la corruption : nous ne pouvons pas attendre que le
d&eacute;veloppement l'ait &eacute;limin&eacute;e. (En tout &eacute;tat
de cause, le d&eacute;veloppement n'est pas non plus un rem&egrave;de
miracle : s'il y a les exemples de Singapour et de Hong-Kong avec
des taux de corruption extr&ecirc;mement bas, il y a aussi l'Italie
o&ugrave; la corruption s'est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;e
en pleine p&eacute;riode de d&eacute;veloppement). Il faut donc
agir, hic et nunc, sur la grande corruption. 
<P>
En analysant quelques-uns des effets de la corruption sur le d&eacute;veloppement,
on peut d'abord constater qu'elle rench&eacute;rit, de mani&egrave;re
non n&eacute;gligeable, le co&ucirc;t des prestations et de fournitures.
Si un taux de 5 % sur sa marge b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire pouvait,
&agrave; la limite, &ecirc;tre support&eacute; par le fournisseur,
les taux de corruption de 10 &agrave; 20 %, devenus usuels, sont
r&eacute;percut&eacute;s sur le prix et pay&eacute;s de la sorte
sur les ressources internes ou externes (en cas de financement
ext&eacute;rieur) d'un pays. C'est donc l'&eacute;conomie nationale
qui supporte le surprix injustifi&eacute; du produit ou de la
prestation, la diff&eacute;rence &eacute;tant empoch&eacute;e
par un fonctionnaire ou un homme politique qui aura abus&eacute;
de son pouvoir au profit de ses int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts priv&eacute;s.
Ces op&eacute;rations &eacute;tant habituellement financ&eacute;es
par cr&eacute;dits bancaires, ou concessionnels dans le cas d'aide
ext&eacute;rieure, les surprix accroissent d'autant la dette du
pays. On suppose d'ailleurs aujourd'hui qu'une partie non n&eacute;gligeable
de la dette ext&eacute;rieure des PVD est constitu&eacute;e par
la contre-valeur des sommes pay&eacute;es au titre de la corruption.

<P>
Mais les m&eacute;faits de ces pratiques ne s'arr&ecirc;tent pas
l&agrave; : le d&eacute;cideur corrompu peut &ecirc;tre tent&eacute;
de se satisfaire d'une prestation de moindre qualit&eacute; qui
lui procurera un profit personnel accru. Ainsi, par exemple, lors
de la r&eacute;alisation d'un projet routier, la complicit&eacute;
entre administration et entreprise peut conduire &agrave; la r&eacute;duction
des normes de qualit&eacute; convenues pour se partager l'&eacute;conomie
r&eacute;alis&eacute;e. L'effet d&eacute;sastreux de la corruption
atteint son comble lorsque la conception d'un projet et, finalement,
son choix m&ecirc;me, sont d&eacute;termin&eacute;s par la corruption.
S'agissant de la conception, on peut penser ainsi &agrave; l'achat
d'une technologie mal adapt&eacute;e aux besoins d'un pays ou
au choix d'une r&eacute;alisation &agrave; forte intensit&eacute;
de capital - plus prometteuse en termes de corruption - plut&ocirc;t
qu'&agrave; forte intensit&eacute; de main-d'oeuvre, qui favoriserait
pourtant davantage le d&eacute;veloppement. 
<P>
Mais o&ugrave; l'on atteint le sommet de la perversion, c'est
lorsque le choix m&ecirc;me des priorit&eacute;s - et donc des
projets - est d&eacute;termin&eacute; par la corruption. Nous
visons ici les situations o&ugrave; les priorit&eacute;s de d&eacute;veloppement
r&eacute;elles d'un pays sont n&eacute;glig&eacute;es en faveur
d'op&eacute;rations qui procurent les plus grands gains personnels
aux d&eacute;cideurs. Et je citerai ici R&eacute;mi Godeau qui
&eacute;crivait dans &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; : &quot;Cimeti&egrave;re
d'&eacute;l&eacute;phants blancs, ces projets morts-n&eacute;s,
d&eacute;voreurs de devises, l'Afrique est truff&eacute;e de larges
autoroutes d&eacute;sertes et rong&eacute;es par la savane, d'usines
livr&eacute;es cl&eacute;s en main laiss&eacute;es &agrave; vau-l'eau
quelques ann&eacute;es &agrave; peine apr&egrave;s leur inauguration,
de lignes de chemin de fer impraticables par manque d'entretien,
de barrages hydro-&eacute;lectriques abandonn&eacute;s faute de
rentabilit&eacute;&quot;. Parlons-en de ces usines cl&eacute;s
en main, de toutes ces &quot;ruines du d&eacute;veloppement&quot;,
un peu partout dans les PVD et notamment en Afrique, qui n'ont
soit jamais fonctionn&eacute;, soit jamais atteint une utilisation
&eacute;conomique de leurs capacit&eacute;s, lorsque leur co&ucirc;t
prohibitif n'oblige pas l'Etat &agrave; les subventionner! Lorsqu'on
remonte la fili&egrave;re, on d&eacute;couvre le plus souvent
des ventes d'usines sans r&eacute;elle mise en concurrence des
fournisseurs, avec un financement commercial (c'est rarement un
financement par aide publique) mais toutefois garanti par des
organismes &eacute;tatiques. Il y a plus ici que pr&eacute;somption
de corruption car quelle autre raison pourrait amener &agrave;
prendre des d&eacute;cisions aussi contraires au d&eacute;veloppement
? Dans son ouvrage &quot;Grand corruption in Third World Development&quot;,
George Moody-Stuart a identifi&eacute; les domaines qui y sont
plus particuli&egrave;rement expos&eacute;s : fournitures militaires
et autres mat&eacute;riels techniquement sophistiqu&eacute;s,
grands travaux, soit tout ce qui &quot;chiffre&quot; et tout ce
qui peut rendre les &eacute;valuations et comparaisons objectives
malais&eacute;es en raison de la sophistication technique. 
<P>
Il n'est pas superflu de mentionner ici qu'un pays qui s'est endett&eacute;
pour r&eacute;aliser des projets qui ne r&eacute;pondent pas &agrave;
ses priorit&eacute;s r&eacute;elles, voire &eacute;conomiquement
inutiles ou absurdes, voit sa dette augmenter, non pas des 10
&agrave; 20 % de la corruption mais, &agrave; la limite, des 100
% de l'investissement rest&eacute; improductif pour l'&eacute;conomie
nationale. Dans le d&eacute;bat sur la dette, on parle rarement
des m&eacute;canismes qui l'ont provoqu&eacute;e. Dans la plupart
des cas, elle est devenue insupportable en raison d'une mauvaise
utilisation des financements ext&eacute;rieurs &agrave; laquelle
la corruption contribue de mani&egrave;re significative. 
<P>
Au surplus, en d&eacute;tournant les rares ressources vers des
domaines non prioritaires ou de moindre priorit&eacute;, la corruption
contribue pour une large part &agrave; ce que les besoins fondamentaux
- alimentation, sant&eacute;, &eacute;ducation - restent insatisfaits.
Elle est donc l'une des causes du sous-d&eacute;veloppement et
de la pauvret&eacute;, en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. Certes, l'aide
publique est souvent appel&eacute;e &agrave; combler des d&eacute;ficits
laiss&eacute;s par des gestions irresponsables de ressources disponibles
par ailleurs. Mais faut-il s'&eacute;tonner alors que l'opinion
publique des pays du Nord puisse, &agrave; la longue, se lasser
de boucher des trous qu'une bonne gestion des ressources n'aurait
pas d&ucirc; faire appara&icirc;tre. Et de quelle mani&egrave;re
convaincre le contribuable europ&eacute;en que c'est &agrave;
lui de prendre en charge des dispensaires de brousse dans des
pays qui investissent leurs fonds dans des projets de prestige,
lorsqu'ils ne sont pas d&eacute;pos&eacute;s sur des comptes en
Suisse ?
<P>
<H3>Un cercle vicieux qu'il faut briser</H3>
<P>
C'est dire que nous sommes quasiment enferm&eacute;s dans un cercle
vicieux : la corruption est une des causes du sous-d&eacute;veloppement
et de la pauvret&eacute;. Mais la pauvret&eacute; contribue &agrave;
son extension : celui qui ne peut gagner honn&ecirc;tement les
moyens de subsistance des siens est pratiquement contraint &agrave;
des m&eacute;thodes moins honn&ecirc;tes. La corruption est donc
bel et bien cause et cons&eacute;quence du sous-d&eacute;veloppement.
Pour rompre ce processus, il faut donc s'attaquer &agrave; la
grande corruption en tant que cause importante du sous-d&eacute;veloppement
et &eacute;liminer graduellement les raisons de sa propagation
dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, et notamment l'insuffisance notoire
de revenus permettant une vie d&eacute;cente. 
<P>
De mani&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, on peut dire que la
corruption tue aussi l'esprit de d&eacute;veloppement. Rien n'est
plus destructeur pour une soci&eacute;t&eacute; que la course
vers &quot;l'argent facile et rapide&quot; qui fait appara&icirc;tre
ceux qui travaillent honn&ecirc;tement et durement comme des imb&eacute;ciles
na&iuml;fs. C'est pourquoi, dans le cadre des r&eacute;formes
&eacute;conomiques appel&eacute;es &quot;ajustement stucturel&quot;,
il importe que le mod&egrave;le pr&eacute;conis&eacute; soit celui
d'une &eacute;conomie de march&eacute;, bien encadr&eacute;e par
la loi et par un Etat efficace, qui ne laisse pas libre cours
&agrave; un capitalisme sauvage orient&eacute; vers le profit
imm&eacute;diat et &agrave; tout prix. L'exemple de certains pays
de transition &agrave; l'Est, o&ugrave; l'&eacute;conomie de march&eacute;
est devenue synonyme de jungle, de mafia et de corruption, doit
nous inciter &agrave; la r&eacute;flexion. 
<P>
Enfin, une &eacute;conomie min&eacute;e par la corruption exerce
un effet r&eacute;pulsif sur les investisseurs ext&eacute;rieurs
potentiels et les bailleurs de fonds publics. Or, le d&eacute;veloppement
exige que les flux financiers soient attir&eacute;s par le pays
qui en a besoin. &quot;Le succ&egrave;s appelle l'argent. Le gaspillage,
l'&eacute;chec et la gabegie le font fuir&quot; comme l'a dit
Serge Michailof. Et si les investisseurs sont d&eacute;termin&eacute;s
&agrave; faire des affaires, ils recherchent, &agrave; l'exception
des aventuriers, des pays d'accueil o&ugrave; le climat est stable
et pr&eacute;visible. On conna&icirc;t ainsi des entrepreneurs
qui se sont retir&eacute;s de certains pays africains - pourtant
dot&eacute;s de ressources - en raison des contraintes de la corruption
qu'ils jugeaient insupportables. Quant aux bailleurs de fonds
publics, ils h&eacute;sitent de plus en plus &agrave; apporter
une aide financi&egrave;re &agrave; des pays qui g&egrave;rent
mal leurs propres ressources. C'est en cela que r&eacute;side
l'une des causes de ce qu'on appelle la lassitude en mati&egrave;re
d'aide publique (&quot;aid fatigue&quot;). Pourquoi d'ailleurs
les institutions d'aide financi&egrave;re n'iraient-elle pas jusqu'&agrave;
la suspension de la coop&eacute;ration en cas flagrant de corruption
et de mauvaise gestion, comme elles le font lorsqu'il y a violation
grave des droits de l'homme ? Invers&eacute;ment, la bonne gestion
des affaires publiques (&quot;good governance&quot;) devrait devenir
le crit&egrave;re d&eacute;terminant de l'allocation de l'aide.
L'article 5 de la Convention de Lom&eacute; IV r&eacute;vis&eacute;e
me semble pr&eacute;figurer une telle orientation. 
<P>
En conclusion, loin de r&eacute;server l'examen critique qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;de
aux pays du Sud, je dirai que les partenaires du Nord ont leur
part de responsabilit&eacute; dans les m&eacute;faits de la corruption,
ne serait-ce qu'en raison de l'incoh&eacute;rence entre leur politique
de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement et leur politique
de promotion des exportations. Partant du principe que les efforts
de coop&eacute;ration sont r&eacute;ellement motiv&eacute;s par
des consid&eacute;rations de d&eacute;veloppement - et je puis
en attester en tout &eacute;tat de cause pour la politique de
l'Union europ&eacute;enne que j'ai servie durant de longues ann&eacute;es
-, il faut bien constater que les pays occidentaux ont tendance
&agrave; promouvoir leurs exportations, avec d'autres instruments,
sans consid&eacute;ration aucune pour leurs effets en termes de
d&eacute;veloppement, contribuant ainsi aux errements que nous
avons analys&eacute;s. Qu'ils tol&egrave;rent, voire encouragent,
la corruption comme un moyen de promotion de leurs ventes - en
limitant l'application du droit p&eacute;nal aux actes sommis
sur leur propre territoire et en permettant la d&eacute;duction
fiscale de la corruption comme &quot;d&eacute;penses utiles&quot;
- me para&icirc;t scandaleux. Il y a, dans les pays du Nord aussi,
un vaste champ de lutte contre le chancre de la corruption internationale,
lutte que nous avons engag&eacute;e dans le cadre de &quot;Transparency
International&quot;. Cette ONG cr&eacute;&eacute;e en 1993 se
tient &agrave; la disposition de tout pays qui souhaite r&eacute;ellement
s'attaquer au fl&eacute;au de la corruption.

<p>
<B>The European Community's investments in human
resource development - health, nutrition and education - in ACP
states have regularly been dealt with at length in the pages of
this magazine whether in the context of dossiers or of country
reports. Here we present a brief description of how EU's policy
in education and training evolved under the Yaound&eacute; and
Lom&eacute; Conventions.</b>
<p>
Educating all the people. This is not just a slogan.  In a poor, under-developed country, there may
be some short-term gains from supplying high quality education
and training to an elite few.  But, as the  'Asian Miracle ' has
proved, major long-term gains in development and wealth are possible
only if the entire population possesses a reasonable level of
education. Now for the problem.  For many countries, notably those
of sub-Saharan Africa, a large proportion of school age children
receive no education at all.  Of those who do attend school, many
receive very little benefit from their education because of the
very low quality of provision.  Only a small minority reach secondary
education.   And yet a higher proportion than ever of national budgets is now going to the education sector.
<P>
The problem is urgent
because of the time it will take to resolve. Even if we could
wave a magic wand to provide all children with a good primary
education, it would take a decade to see the benefits.
<P>
How is
European aid helping to tackle this problem? What have been the
guiding principles of European aid to education in the past? And
why is the problem still acute in, for example, sub-Saharan Africa,
despite decades of investment in aid to education?

<H3>Aid mirrors developments</H3>

Aid to education has mirrored developments in the
education sectors of the countries concerned. For example, the
low-income countries of Africa, which account for 73% of Africa's
population, have seen a rapid expansion in their education systems
followed by a collapse of funding. This has resulted in a serious
decline in standards of provision. European aid which began by
providing piecemeal assistance to infrastructure and manpower,
shifted to a  'project approach ' to tackle these emerging problems
and is now moving towards a coordinated sectoral approach to help
tackle the reform of whole education systems.
<P>
From 1970 to 1980,
the number of pupils enroling in the primary schools of developing
countries more than doubled, and the numbers in secondary and
tertiary education quadrupled. Even relative to the increasing
population, there was a 90% increase in the proportion of primary-aged
children in school, and a large increase in the proportion of
girls. This growth was accompanied by a doubling of government
budgetary resources made available to education.
<P>
In the massive general economic decline between 1980 and 1985, the money made
available for education from the public purse fell by 40%, yet
the education systems continued to grow.  The result was that
teacher salaries plummeted, and funds for non-salary recurrent
costs such as teaching materials and maintenance virtually dried
up.
<P>
Since 1985, the financial situation has somewhat improved
and funding is now at an all-time high. Nevertheless, for many
African states, the education sector is in a state of crisis.
Buildings are crumbling and inadequate; teachers are untrained
or undertrained and often absent because of low incentives and
weak supervision.  There are few books and other teaching materials.
Consequently, many pupils leave school virtually illiterate and
innumerate. Moreover, because of the low quality of instruction
and increasing costs to parents, many parents are no longer bothering
to send children to school even when places are available. Primary
enrolment fell by around 10% between 1990 and 1992. Thus in many
countries, a fundamental reform of the sector is seen as the only
way forward.

<H3>Evolution of aid</H3>

In the early days of European aid,
education and training were seen as suppliers of manpower for
countries to modernise their economies. The priority themes of
the 1970 Yaound&eacute; Convention for European Community aid
were industrialisation, regional cooperation and international
trade. Community support to education and training focused on
the construction of colleges and university faculties to serve
industrialisation and regional cooperation.
<P>
The 1975 Lom&eacute;
I Convention referred specifically to  'the establishment of regional
institutions of advanced technology, in the context of training
programmes to enable nationals to participate fully in economic
development '.
<P>
The 1980 Lom&eacute; II Convention introduced
multiannual training programmes, and support in the form of training
awards and courses/seminars; experts and instructors; teaching
equipment; collaboration between training or research establishments
and universities. The emphasis was still on vocational training
for other sectors.
<P>
A significant proportion of European bilateral
aid to education and training took the form of European teachers
for secondary schools, colleges and universities. These helped
to cover the shortage of locally trained teachers, whilst educating
an elite able to fill senior and middle positions in the public
and private sectors.
<P>
By 1985, problems were becoming all too apparent
within the education systems being supported. As in other sectors,
there was increased emphasis on the  'project approach ' towards
tackling these problems. Thus the Lom&eacute; III Convention includes
support to education and training  'in the form of integrated
programmes aimed at a well-defined objective '. This could include,
for example,  'assisting the ACP States' own efforts to restructure
their educational establishments and systems and to update curricula,
methods and technology employed, in order to step up the effectiveness
and cut back the cost of all types of training '. A concern for
under-represented groups, particularly women, was also becoming
explicit.
<P>
By 1990, the concept of investing in people through
education and training had become high on the donor agenda, and
alongside it, a growing concern for sectoral reform.  According
to the 1989 Lom&eacute; IV Convention,  'Cooperation shall be
aimed at supporting development in the ACP States, a process centred
on man himself and rooted in each people's culture. It shall back
up the policies and measures adopted by those States to enhance
their human resources, increase their own creative capacities
and promote their cultural identities. Cooperation shall also
encourage participation by the population in the design and execution
of development operations. ' In a chapter entitled Operations
to enhance the value of human resources, a section on Education
and Training refers to supporting the ACP State's efforts to 
'reform their basic education institutions and systems, in particular
by providing overall primary education coverage and adjusting
imported systems as well as building them into development strategies'.
<P>
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, European states and the
Community joined the World Bank in support to structural adjustment.
In a 1991 communication to the European Development Council, the
European Commission stated that it  'will give absolute priority
to the social dimension of adjustment, in particular ensuring
that health and education sectors are adequately covered, in conjunction
with sectoral reforms introduced or planned in these two areas.'
<P>
Balancing this concern for system reform has been a growing
appreciation of the importance of decentralised cooperation. An
example is the cost-sharing microprojects for grassroots development
first introduced in Lom&eacute; I with explicit mention of support
to primary schools. Another example is the need to support the
activities of non-governmental organisations.

<H3>A new policy</H3>

Two events in the early 1990s have had a profound impact on European
support for education and training. The first was the World Conference
on Education for All: Meeting the Basic Learning Needs, held in
Jomtien in 1990. This emphasised the need for universal primary
education and adult literacy to be firmly placed on the political
agenda, and has resulted in a profound swing of donor support
away from higher education and towards primary education. The
second important event was the 1992 Treaty of European Union which
requires the coordination of Member States' policy and operations
particularly in the social sectors. Guidelines are contained in
the 1994 Council Resolution on support to education and training
in developing countries in which  'The Council emphasizes that
education, in particular basic education, is a fundamental right'.
<P>
According to the Resolution,  'the priority for the Community
and the Member States must be both to maximise access to education
within the limits of the resources available and to ensure that
the quality of education provided is suited to the needs of the
majority of students. This is to be achieved through  'a balanced,
programme-based strategy, tailored to the specific circumstances
of the individual developing country ', with pride of place accorded
to basic education. It should provide  'support to the developing
countries' own policies and efforts ', not acting as a substitute
for local initiative, and should involve better integration of
action under structural adjustment with Education sector priorities
and aid activities. The Council also recommends a special emphasis
on coordination in a number of pilot countries.
<P>
From the outset, Community aid to education and training in Africa, Caribbean and
Pacific countries has been a response to requests from the ACP
States with an emphasis on ownership of the resulting programme
by those states. What the new policy introduces into this process
is a dialogue between government and all donors on needs, priorities
and approaches set in the context of the education sector as a
whole.  Only through such a comprehensive approach can developing
countries and European States reach a true partnership in realising
the education and training needs of all citizens on which the
future of their countries so crucially depends.<p>

<I>Le bilan de vingt ans d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement du Sahel
est mitig&eacute;. Si l'aide a su organiser les moyens, elle s'est
av&eacute;r&eacute;e incapable de mobiliser les hommes. D'o&ugrave;
la priorit&eacute; de tenir compte des aspirations et des r&eacute;actions
des populations locales.</I>
<HR>
<P>
La communaut&eacute; internationale a d&eacute;couvert le Sahel
lors de la grande s&eacute;cheresse de 1973-1974. Le symbolique
&#171;contrat de g&eacute;n&eacute;ration&#187; conclu alors entre
les pays sah&eacute;liens et les institutions et pays donateurs
exprimait un v&eacute;ritable engagement. Depuis, l'aide ext&eacute;rieure
occupe une place extr&ecirc;mement importante, plus peut-&ecirc;tre
que nulle part ailleurs, dans certains domaines de la vie des
pays sah&eacute;liens.
<P>
Au terme de vingt ann&eacute;es de coop&eacute;ration, le moment
est venu de faire un bilan des actions entreprises. Tel est le
sens de l'exercice dans lequel les partenaires r&eacute;unis au
sein du Club du Sahel se sont engag&eacute;s. Pour &eacute;tablir
un nouveau &#171;contrat de g&eacute;n&eacute;ration&#187; avec
les pays sah&eacute;liens, ils m&egrave;nent de front deux r&eacute;flexions.
D'une part, ils tentent de dresser un diagnostic des transformations
du Sahel, sans lequel toute r&eacute;flexion sur l'aide serait
d&eacute;connect&eacute;e des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s. Ce projet,
connu sous le nom de Sahel 21 et pilot&eacute; par le Comit&eacute;
inter-&Eacute;tats de lutte contre la s&eacute;cheresse dans le
Sahel, permettra de savoir quelle vision les Sah&eacute;liens
ont de leur avenir. D'autre part, les donateurs proc&egrave;dent
&agrave; une analyse approfondie des m&eacute;canismes et de l'impact
r&eacute;el de l'aide, esp&eacute;rant en retirer des enseignements
qui serviront de guides ou de garde-fous &agrave; l'avenir.
<P>
Aujourd'hui, la situation des pays sah&eacute;liens est &agrave;
bien des &eacute;gards plus favorable qu'au milieu des ann&eacute;es
1970. La question alimentaire est moins pr&eacute;occupante, avec
des succ&egrave;s agricoles reconnus dans les secteurs du coton,
du riz, des fruits et l&eacute;gumes. L'investissement dans la
construction urbaine a &eacute;t&eacute; consid&eacute;rable.
La l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; des institutions et la participation
des populations ont largement progress&eacute;. Un secteur priv&eacute;
moderne se structure peu &agrave; peu. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; leur
mobilit&eacute; r&eacute;gionale et internationale, les habitants
ont tiss&eacute; de nouveaux r&eacute;seaux de solidarit&eacute;
et de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
<H3>Des acquis fragiles</H3>
<P>
Mais les acquis de ces derni&egrave;res
ann&eacute;es semblent encore fragiles, tant du point de vue des
institutions que de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire, de
la gestion des ressources naturelles ou de la paix civile. Les
populations sah&eacute;liennes restent parmi les plus pauvres
au monde et figurent dans les derniers rangs des classements internationaux
en termes de bien-&ecirc;tre. Indicateur cl&eacute; du d&eacute;veloppement,
le taux de scolarisation demeure tr&egrave;s bas, en particulier
pour les filles.
<P>
Ces progr&egrave;s et ces faiblesses montrent cependant l'image
de soci&eacute;t&eacute;s sah&eacute;liennes en mouvement. L'aide
a contribu&eacute; &agrave; leur &eacute;volution et imprim&eacute;
durablement leur fonctionnement. Par de multiples actions locales,
elle exerce une influence dans de nombreux domaines : infrastructures
et communications, r&eacute;partition de la population, enseignement
sup&eacute;rieur, dispositif hospitalier et sanitaire, paysage
institutionnel, restructuration &eacute;conomique, etc. Toutefois,
notre propos n'est pas d'imputer &agrave; l'aide l'ensemble des
transformations qu'a connues le Sahel. Le d&eacute;veloppement
des villes, les dynamiques de la majeure partie de l'agriculture
et du secteur informel, les &eacute;volutions sociales ne doivent
que tr&egrave;s peu &agrave; l'aide ext&eacute;rieure. Par ailleurs,
l'aide peut &ecirc;tre jug&eacute;e trop pr&eacute;sente, critiquable,
voire nocive. Quoi qu'il en soit, elle est loin d'avoir &eacute;t&eacute;
inop&eacute;rante. Les efforts fournis et les moyens mis en place
ont incontestablement laiss&eacute; une profonde empreinte dans
les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s sah&eacute;liennes. Reste &agrave;
en d&eacute;gager les forces et les faiblesses.
<P>
Am&eacute;liorer la coop&eacute;ration exige de r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir
aux &eacute;checs de l'aide, de comprendre pourquoi certains objectifs
- par exemple le d&eacute;veloppement des institutions, l'intensification
des cultures c&eacute;r&eacute;ali&egrave;res ou l'int&eacute;gration
r&eacute;gionale - demeurent difficiles &agrave; atteindre malgr&eacute;
l'importance des moyens mis en oeuvre.
<P>
En fait, il semble que l'aide r&eacute;ussisse &agrave; apporter
de nouveaux instruments (ouvrages, messages, techniques, savoirs)
mais qu'elle soit beaucoup moins efficace lorsqu'il s'agit d'influencer
l'utilisation de ces instruments, peut-&ecirc;tre parce qu'elle
n'a pas su prendre en compte le facteur humain. Le syst&egrave;me
d'aide s'est montr&eacute; bon planificateur, dans le sens o&ugrave;
il sait organiser les moyens, mais m&eacute;diocre strat&egrave;ge,
car il g&egrave;re mal les ressources humaines. Il a ainsi jou&eacute;
un r&ocirc;le important pour am&eacute;nager le territoire, construire
des routes, des barrages, des forages, am&eacute;liorer le capital
g&eacute;n&eacute;tique des plantes, etc. Peut-on en dire autant
de la fluidit&eacute; du trafic routier, de l'utilisation pertinente
des forages ou de la vulgarisation agricole ?
<P>
Pour comprendre la remise en cause actuelle de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement,
on ne peut &eacute;viter d'&eacute;voquer les doutes qui traversent
les acteurs de l'aide. Qui n'a pas &eacute;prouv&eacute; l'impression
de travailler &agrave; une entreprise absurde, de faire partie
d'un syst&egrave;me qui perd parfois le sens de ses objectifs
? C'est l&agrave; un constat plut&ocirc;t d&eacute;rangeant, mais
auquel tout responsable de l'action quotidienne au Sahel est parvenu
&agrave; un moment ou &agrave; un autre. On sait peu comment se
manifeste cette perte de sens. On invoque le plus souvent l'absence
de coordination des donateurs, l'exc&egrave;s d'aide (l'offre
d'aide dans certains domaines ne correspondant plus &agrave; une
demande) et le caract&egrave;re &eacute;ph&eacute;m&egrave;re
des interventions.
<P>
L'aide a surtout privil&eacute;gi&eacute; l'action imm&eacute;diate
aux d&eacute;pens de la continuit&eacute;. De plus, les donateurs
n'ayant pas pris le temps de comprendre les probl&egrave;mes en
profondeur, ils ont n&eacute;glig&eacute; la capacit&eacute; des
organisations humaines &agrave; r&eacute;soudre leurs difficult&eacute;s.
Ils ont ainsi longtemps soutenu la constitution &agrave; grands
frais d'un secteur industriel public comme base du d&eacute;veloppement
des villes, alors que celui-ci a finalement repos&eacute; pour
l'essentiel sur le secteur informel. Les donateurs ont le pouvoir
de susciter l'adh&eacute;sion &agrave; leurs vues et &agrave;
leurs objectifs, mais le dialogue actuel avec les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
est-il suffisant pour &eacute;tablir un v&eacute;ritable partenariat
?
<P>
<H3>Pour un second souffle</H3>
<P>
Le Sahel est pris dans le grand
processus de transformation qui a caract&eacute;ris&eacute; le
d&eacute;veloppement d'autres r&eacute;gions du monde : accroissement
d&eacute;mographique, ouverture internationale, n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
de formation du capital humain, &eacute;mergence de la comp&eacute;tition.
Ces changements s'exercent &agrave; un rythme tr&egrave;s rapide,
entra&icirc;nant d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibres, d&eacute;sordres
et retards d'adaptation. Ceux-ci ne dureront probablement pas,
mais il est indispensable de les comprendre et de les traiter
sur le long terme. Autant qu'en 1975, le Sahel a besoin que la
communaut&eacute; internationale s'engage durablement &agrave;
ses c&ocirc;t&eacute;s.
<P>
A cette situation critique des pays sah&eacute;liens
s'ajoute la red&eacute;finition de l'aide qu'op&egrave;rent les
pays donateurs. Diff&eacute;rentes visions du d&eacute;veloppement
et du r&ocirc;le de la coop&eacute;ration se sont succ&eacute;d&eacute;es
depuis cinquante ans. L'euphorie du chantier du d&eacute;veloppement
a progressivement fait place &agrave; la rigueur de l'orthodoxie
&eacute;conomique et financi&egrave;re puis &agrave; la tentation
de l'&#171;afro-pessimisme&#187; et &agrave; la &#171;fatigue
de l'aide&#187;. Les contraintes financi&egrave;res se sont resserr&eacute;es
et les flux d'aide diminuent. L'aide est peut-&ecirc;tre en train
d'entrer en crise dans bon nombre de pays donateurs. Son efficacit&eacute;
et m&ecirc;me sa l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; sont de plus en plus
remises en question. Le Sahel n'est pas seul concern&eacute;,
mais peut appara&icirc;tre comme un espace t&eacute;moin de cette
crise de l'aide.
<P>
Aujourd'hui, face aux d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibres persistants
des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s sah&eacute;liennes, face au d&eacute;sir
de d&eacute;veloppement que continuent d'exprimer les populations
locales, la communaut&eacute; internationale a besoin de retrouver
une l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; pour la coop&eacute;ration et le
&#171;contrat de g&eacute;n&eacute;ration&#187; &agrave; venir.
Cela appelle un nouveau projet motivant pour se donner le go&ucirc;t
de l'engagement. C'est &agrave; ces aspirations que s'adresse
le programme Coop&eacute;ration 21 du Club du Sahel.

Are Africans culturally hindered in enterprise and commercial

<hr>
<P>
<B>With Africa lagging behind in almost every sphere of economic
development, this rather unpleasing question in the title is not
entirely impertinent so long as it is not misconstrued as calling
into question the intellect and industriousness of Africans.</B>
<P>
 Culture is undeniably a crucial factor in economic development,
but the issue raised by this question is not so much African culture,
the vibrancy of which continues to enrich the world, as the culture
of enterprise, about which we must look to history for an explanation.
In doing so, we must first avoid generalisation on a continent
as immense and diverse as Africa, where environment, experiences
and varied animist traditions have combined to shape the characteristics
of communities, their ways of life and their vision of the world.
We must also limit our ambition to sub-Saharan Africa and admit
that some communities here, as elsewhere in the world, are relatively
more dynamic, enterprising and creative than others - the <I>Ibos</I>
in Nigeria and the <I>Bamilekes</I> in Cameroon, are just two
examples. All, however, have suffered the misfortunes of history.
<P>
<B>Archaeological evidence</B>
<P>
 If there is anything archaeological discoveries have taught us
in recent years, it is that several ancient African societies
were as technologically advanced as any of their time. The Ugbo-Uku
works of art in metal, which date back to between the 9th and
10th centuries, and which were the subjects of acclaimed exhibitions
in the United States and Europe in the first half of the 1980s,
provide incontrovertible evidence to that effect. They radically
changed Western perception of African civilisation during these
periods. The continent's arts had been labelled 'primitive' because
they consisted essentially of wooden sculptures and terracottas.
Most of the works of arts in bronze in museums across Europe (some
of which were looted) date back to the15th century.
<P>
 The Igbo-Ukwu discoveries proved that, although the appearance
of the Portuguese on the western coast of Africa at that time
gave a boost to works of art in bronze, some African societies
had already mastered the technology of metal - how to mine and
cast it. The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu were made from an alloy of locally
available copper, lead and tin. They are widely acknowledged to
be of very high technical quality and artistic refinement. Although
most of the arts were court art and often had religious significance
or utility, the extent to which the knowledge of metal casting
would have formed the basis of a technological revolution in agriculture
and industry in these societies will never be known, since history
took a different turn.
<P>
<B>Arab and European intrusion</B>
<P>
 Africans are often accused of blaming their misfortunes on colonialism,
but such criticism stems from a total lack of understanding of
the extent to which Arab and European intrusion into Africa disrupted
traditional societies.
<P>
 In pre-colonial times, societies, from the Sahel down to Southern
Africa, were well organised in kingdoms, chiefdoms, clans and
villages and were governed by a series of laws or 'taboos' handed
down from generation to generation. The societies were either
nomadic or sedentary. Although the individual existed only in
a group, his or her status in society was determined by birth.
One was born into a family of nobles, freemen or slaves. The socio-professional
structure was equally well-defined in the sense that one was also
born a herdsman, a farmer, a blacksmith, etc, with little or no
possibility of changing profession (European societies during
these periods were structured along similar lines as family names
across generations show).
<P>
 Communities were self-sufficient. Production was entirely family-based.
While grazing was done in wide open spaces, extensive farming
was practised because of the abundance of arable lands. There
was thus no need for the technologies of intensive production.
Ancient Africa was largely rural and sparsely populated. Trade
was minimal and unprofitable.
<P>
 The earliest recorded contact between sub-Saharan Africa and
the outside world was around the 10th century. It started with
Arabs from North Africa who came south to trade salt and crafts
for gold and slaves. This trade led to the founding of great commercial
centres such as Koumbi Saleh, Walata, Gao and Timbuktu. It also
facilitated the penetration of Islam in the region1. However,
the real beneficiaries of the trade were not the local communities
(salt and crafts were hardly wealth-creating commodities), but
Arab merchants who had exclusive control over it. There were no
possibilities for a Sahelian business class to emerge.
<P>
 The Portuguese, who appeared along the West African coast in
the 15th century traded in much the same commmodities as the Arabs
in the north, but on a much smaller scale. This lasted until the
17th century when Portugal lost its trade monopoly to other European
powers. This marked the beginning of Africa's nightmare.
<P>
 Gold decisively took second place to slaves as the most sought-after
'merchandise'. Slave hunting, which was being practised on a small
scale by the belligerent aristocracy, intensified. Insecurity
increased and the resulting anarchy wreaked havoc on the social
fabrics of the coastal kingdoms.
<P>
 The abolition of slave trade in the early 19th century did not
significantly change the situation. The end of that trade resulted
in the transformation, adaptation and expansion of international
trade to the benefits of European traders. Hides, arabic gum,
groundnuts, timber, rubber, cocoa, palm oil and so on were exported
in return mainly for manufactured goods. Only a minority of the
African aristocracy was involved: any who dared challenge the
European monopoly was severely dealt with. Often the punishment
was exile and several African potentates suffered that fate. The
tragedy of <I>King Ja Ja</I> of Opodo was a case in point. Here
was a monarch who had set up a monopoly in his territory and who
made sure that the article which provided for free trade under
the British Protectorate agreement in southern Nigeria was removed
in the version he signed (he actually nursed the ambition to trade
directly with England). In 1887, he was arrested and deported
to Barbados for refusing to apply the terms of the 1885 Berlin
Treaty in his territory. That treaty guaranteed freedom of navigation
which, if applied, would have opened up his kingdom to free trade
(see issue no. 133 of <I>The Courier</I> at page 102).
<P>
 King Ja Ja's sense of business acumen was indisputable. It is
easy to imagine what economic impact monarchs like him would have
had on Africa had they had the opportunity to control trade in
their kingdoms or to trade directly with the outside world.
<P>
<B>Open to new but disruptive ideas</B>
<P>
 The slow but successful penetration of Islam and Christianity
(both of which were initially fiercely resisted by Africans who
clung desperately to their animist beliefs), illustrated the openness
of those societies to new ideas and to change. Unfortunately the
ideas which Islam and Christianity inculcated were more destructive
than constructive as they led to the erosion of traditional African
values in favour of foreign ones.
<P>
 Although colonialism, which followed, brought stability and security
of sorts, it upset the social order. 'Alongside traditional society,
a new urban society, completely divorced from its rural roots,
emerged. The schools set up by the colonial administration produced
a new social class of ancillliary workers such as interpreters,
clerks, teachers, nurses and post office employees. This class
was relatively privileged but was often rejected by the population
and treated with both fear and envy.'1
<P>
 A class of technicians - mechanics and various other technical
workers who were also products of the colonial school system -
was born. Not belonging to the traditional castes of craftsmen,
there was no continuity between pre-colonial African technical
knowledge, which had suffered so much disruption, and the new
technologies introduced by the Europeans. This category of educated
technician was  employed mainly in the nascent European-owned
factories which were geared to import substitution in the aftermaths
of the first and second world wars. This reduced further the possibility
of cross-fertilisation of knowledge between the modern and the
traditional.
<P>
 Large-scale businesses were in the hands of colonial companies
while newcomers - Syrians and Lebanese - had a virtual monopoly
of the retail trade by virtue of their access to capital. Studies
into the role of these newcomers in the Senegalese economy during
the colonial era and immediately afterwards revealed the extent
to which capital formation among the indigenous population was
impeded by the systems of 'credit-sale' or 'hire-purchase' that
they introduced. Under this system, the new class of African civil
servants obtained supplies on credit against their monthly salaries.
This not only translated into perpetual indebtedness and lack
of savings, but also into the adoption of a consumption pattern
that was both foreign and expensive.
<P>
 A similar situation existed elsewhere. In the rest of West Africa,
the retail trade was also dominated by Syrians and Lebanese and
in East Africa by Indians. While the former shied away from reinvestment
of profits into production, the latter did not, illustrating perhaps
their degree of commitment to their adopted countries. 'The colonial
era was thus no more favourable to the emergence of a local African
business class than earlier periods had been.'1
<P>
 In the late 1970s and 1980s the situation bred resentment and,
in some countries, naked xenophobia. The attitude of African governments
varied from inaction to expropriations. In Uganda, <I>Idi Amin
Dada</I> confiscated Indian properties and expelled Asians from
the country with devastating economic consequences. In Nigeria,
where indigenous peoples did gain access to capital in the wake
of the oil boom, the military government issued an indigenisation
decree which, among other things, reserved the retail trade for
Nigerians. The beneficiaries of that decree, as some studies show,
were mainly women who had acquired commercial skills through the
local market system. Indeed the increasing role of businesswomen
in enterprises (the <I>mama benzes</I>, for example) not only
in Nigeria, but throughout West Africa, has been a major phenomenon
of the past two decades. Unfortunately there have not been enough
of them and they have avoided risk-taking - recent studies in
the West suggest that women are less inclined to take business
risks. Most other governments have been more prudent in seeking
greater commitment of the 'newcomers' to their host countries
in terms of investments in production.
<P>
 It is clear from the foregoing that foreign intrusion in Africa
has been detrimental to the birth and growth of an entrepreneurial
class. Nevertheless evidence of African ingenuity, creativity
and entrepreneurship abound in the traditional sector which has
continued to evolve despite being affected by that intrusion.
Today, the informal sector (both urban and rural) provides the
basis for the continent's survival in terms of both production
and employment.

The Club du Sahel is made up of CILSS countries (Burkina Faso,
Cape Verde, Chad, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania,
Niger and Senegal and OECD states  that play an active part in
the region (Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,
Switzerland, USA and Germany). This book is the source of much
of the information in this article, particularly as regards the
pre-colonial and colonial periods.

<I>L'&eacute;conomie du d&eacute;veloppement vacille sur ses fondements
: &eacute;chec des politiques de croissance ax&eacute;es sur l'industrie,
d&eacute;couverte du r&ocirc;le cl&eacute; de l'agriculture dans
le succ&egrave;s des &eacute;conomies asiatiques. M&ecirc;me si
l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement reste souhaitable, ses bases doivent
&ecirc;tre enti&egrave;rement revues.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Dans les ann&eacute;es 1950 et 1960, le d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique
semblait facile &agrave; atteindre. Le Premier ministre indien
Nehru ne comparait-il pas les planificateurs &eacute;conomiques
&agrave; des ing&eacute;nieurs construisant un pont ? Pour transformer
une &eacute;conomie arri&eacute;r&eacute;e, il suffisait d'utiliser
les param&egrave;tres techniques des industries modernes dans
le cadre d'un mod&egrave;le national de planification et de mettre
d'importantes quantit&eacute;s de capitaux &agrave; la disposition
du gouvernement.
<P>
Le mod&egrave;le de d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique enseign&eacute;
&agrave; l'&eacute;poque par les universitaires et appliqu&eacute;
par les responsables politiques refl&eacute;tait cette logique
simple. Il faisait de la mobilisation de l'&eacute;pargne le moteur
du d&eacute;veloppement, le plan national se chargeant d'affecter
de fa&ccedil;on optimale les ressources financi&egrave;res. L'&eacute;pargne
devait ainsi servir &agrave; construire des entreprises modernes
permettant d'accro&icirc;tre la production industrielle, synonyme
de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
Le taux de croissance &eacute;conomique d&eacute;pendant directement
du volume de capital investi dans le secteur industriel, l'enjeu
fondamental &eacute;tait de mobiliser une &eacute;pargne importante.
Les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices des nouvelles entreprises constituaient
une source significative d'accroissement de l'&eacute;pargne,
d'autant plus facile &agrave; diriger vers de nouveaux investissements
industriels quand les entreprises &eacute;taient la propri&eacute;t&eacute;
de l'&Eacute;tat.
<P>
Toutefois, la principale source d'&eacute;pargne disponible pour
l'&Eacute;tat, particuli&egrave;rement au tout premier stade de
d&eacute;veloppement, provenait du secteur agricole. Le gouvernement
alimentait en effet l'&eacute;pargne nationale en taxant les exportations
agricoles, en fixant des prix agricoles &agrave; un niveau relativement
bas, en vendant au prix fort des biens manufactur&eacute;s dans
les campagnes et en sur&eacute;valuant la monnaie. Cette politique
permettait de maintenir &agrave; un faible niveau les salaires
dans l'industrie (et l'agriculture) et d'importer &agrave; bas
prix les intrants n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; l'industrie. Elle
&eacute;tait sens&eacute;e garantir des profits industriels &eacute;lev&eacute;s
et une croissance &eacute;conomique rapide.
<P>
<H3>Ce qu'il ne faut pas faire</H3>
<P>
Au d&eacute;but de l'industrialisation, r&eacute;duire la ponction
sur les ressources tir&eacute;es de l'agriculture semblait inopportun,
car cela aurait frein&eacute; la croissance industrielle. Mais
avec la transformation des structures &eacute;conomiques (poids
d&eacute;croissant de l'agriculture dans l'&eacute;conomie), les
b&eacute;n&eacute;fices d'une industrie en expansion pouvaient
jouer le r&ocirc;le tenu auparavant par l'&eacute;pargne agricole.
<P>
Ce mod&egrave;le &eacute;conomique a exerc&eacute; une grande
influence malgr&eacute; sa simplicit&eacute;. Il privil&eacute;giait
en fait syst&eacute;matiquement les villes par rapport &agrave;
l'agriculture. Cette strat&eacute;gie ne tenait pas uniquement
&agrave; l'action des syndicats ou d'hommes politiques born&eacute;s,
mais se trouvait au coeur m&ecirc;me du processus de d&eacute;veloppement.
Ce premier mod&egrave;le sugg&eacute;rait que tout effort de soutien
&agrave; l'agriculture r&eacute;duit in&eacute;vitablement le
taux de croissance &eacute;conomique et que presque toutes les
ressources du gouvernement doivent &ecirc;tre affect&eacute;es
au secteur industriel. D'ailleurs, plus la domination de l'industrie
sur l'&eacute;conomie s'affirmait, marginalisant l'importance
de l'agriculture, moins il semblait utile de consacrer les maigres
ressources nationales &agrave; d&eacute;velopper l'agriculture
- secteur de toute fa&ccedil;on en d&eacute;clin.
<P>
R&eacute;trospectivement, il est clair que cette strat&eacute;gie
fond&eacute;e sur la planification centrale et la discrimination
&agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'agriculture a ruin&eacute; l'&eacute;conomie
de nombreux pays parmi les moins avanc&eacute;s. Mais certains
gouvernements, particuli&egrave;rement en Asie de l'Est et du
Sud-Est, se sont d&eacute;tach&eacute;s de ce mod&egrave;le &agrave;
la fin des ann&eacute;es 1960 et au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es
1970, sans toutefois compter aveugl&eacute;ment sur le libre-&eacute;change
et le secteur priv&eacute; pour constituer le moteur de la croissance.
Au contraire, ils ont stimul&eacute; le secteur agricole afin
d'assurer la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire nationale et cherch&eacute;
un &eacute;quilibre entre le r&ocirc;le des forces du march&eacute;
et l'action n&eacute;cessaire de l'&Eacute;tat dans l'ensemble
de l'&eacute;conomie.
<P>
Sur quoi repose cet &eacute;quilibre ? Telle est la question que
les &eacute;conomistes se posent au milieu des ann&eacute;es 1990.
Les gouvernements peuvent-ils faire quelque chose, &eacute;clair&eacute;s
par les annales du d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique, pour
acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer le rythme de croissance ? L'histoire du
d&eacute;veloppement est riche d'enseignements sur ce que les
pouvoirs publics ne doivent pas faire. Mais existe-t-il un ensemble
de mesures politiques et d'investissements publics susceptible
d'entra&icirc;ner une croissance rapide et durable ? R&eacute;pondre
&agrave; cette question constitue la priorit&eacute; de nombreux
pays : en Europe de l'Est et dans l'ancienne Union sovi&eacute;tique
d'une part, o&ugrave; se d&eacute;roulent de virulents d&eacute;bats
autour des strat&eacute;gies propres &agrave; assurer la restructuration
des &eacute;conomies socialistes ; en Afrique et en Am&eacute;rique
latine d'autre part, o&ugrave; il convient de rem&eacute;dier
au d&eacute;clin &eacute;conomique que beaucoup de pays ont connu
tout au long des ann&eacute;es 1980 ; et m&ecirc;me aux &Eacute;tats-Unis,
o&ugrave; l'administration Clinton est en conflit avec le Congr&egrave;s
r&eacute;publicain &agrave; propos du r&ocirc;le de l'&Eacute;tat.
Ce n'est gu&egrave;re qu'en Asie, particuli&egrave;rement de l'Est
et du Sud-Est, que l'on a appris &agrave; maintenir un rythme
constant et soutenu de croissance &eacute;conomique.
<P>
Le mod&egrave;le de d&eacute;veloppement de l'Asie de l'Est, &eacute;labor&eacute;
au cours des ann&eacute;es 1960, se fixait trois objectifs : croissance,
stabilit&eacute; et &eacute;quit&eacute;. Une strat&eacute;gie
de d&eacute;veloppement int&eacute;grant ces trois facteurs est
la cl&eacute; d'une croissance &agrave; la fois rapide et durable.
La plupart des analyses du succ&egrave;s &eacute;conomique des
pays de la r&eacute;gion ont surtout soulign&eacute; les bienfaits
du maintien d'un taux de change comp&eacute;titif et d'une &eacute;conomie
tir&eacute;e par les exportations. Cependant, depuis quelque temps,
les analystes mettent en &eacute;vidence le r&ocirc;le de la stabilit&eacute;
et de l'&eacute;quit&eacute; dans la croissance rapide des pays
riverains du Pacifique.
<P>
En particulier, un facteur explique que les pays d'Asie de l'Est
aient trouv&eacute; un consensus politique sur les strat&eacute;gies
de croissance tourn&eacute;es vers l'ext&eacute;rieur et aient
pu s'adapter aux chocs &eacute;conomiques externes de la fin des
ann&eacute;es 1970 et du d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1980 :
l'importance accord&eacute;e &agrave; l'agriculture et &agrave;
une &eacute;conomie rurale dynamique. La r&eacute;partition &eacute;galitaire
des revenus a permis d'accro&icirc;tre les investissements dans
l'&eacute;ducation et la formation des ressources humaines, consid&eacute;r&eacute;e
aujourd'hui comme un facteur cl&eacute; de croissance &eacute;conomique.
Par ailleurs, l'option des pays d'Asie de l'Est pour la stabilit&eacute;
&eacute;conomique et politique et l'aptitude des gouvernements
&agrave; pr&eacute;server cette stabilit&eacute; expliquent que
les investisseurs priv&eacute;s et publics prennent leurs d&eacute;cisions
dans une optique de long terme.
<P>
Une le&ccedil;on importante se d&eacute;gage donc de l'exp&eacute;rience
de ces pays : la stabilit&eacute; &eacute;conomique et politique
peut activer la croissance &eacute;conomique, et les pauvres peuvent
en b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier. Dans un environnement macro-&eacute;conomique
favorable et stable, les perspectives sont positives, la confiance
se traduit par des investissements &agrave; long terme qui g&eacute;n&egrave;rent
des gains rapides de productivit&eacute;. La stabilit&eacute;
de l'&eacute;conomie rurale, en particulier les m&eacute;canismes
de protection contre une chute rapide des prix des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales,
rassure les agriculteurs et les encourage &agrave; investir dans
de nouvelles technologies et de nouveaux intrants. En m&ecirc;me
temps, la stabilit&eacute; des prix pr&eacute;serve les travailleurs
agricoles sans terre et les classes urbaines pauvres d'une flamb&eacute;e
des prix des aliments de base, auxquels ils consacrent l'essentiel
de leurs ressources. La stabilit&eacute; des prix alimentaires
signifie &eacute;galement que les employeurs n'ont pas &agrave;
appr&eacute;hender de changements brutaux de co&ucirc;ts salariaux.
Ils peuvent donc investir davantage et utiliser des techniques
plus intensives en travail.
<P>
<H3>R&ocirc;le de l'&eacute;conomie rurale</H3>
<P>
La plupart des pays asiatiques pr&eacute;sentent un d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre
entre l'importance de la population et la surface agricole disponible.
Assurer la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire interne est donc
pour tout gouvernement le pr&eacute;alable &agrave; la stabilit&eacute;
&eacute;conomique et politique. Les disettes et famines en zone
rurale, les &eacute;meutes de la faim en ville sapent tout effort
de construire une &eacute;conomie moderne. La s&eacute;curit&eacute;
alimentaire des m&eacute;nages ruraux et des prix alimentaires
stables en zone urbaine sont essentiels au d&eacute;marrage et
au maintien du processus de croissance &eacute;conomique.
<P>
C'est la raison pour laquelle les grands pays asiatiques ont d&eacute;velopp&eacute;
leur agriculture, en particulier le secteur du riz. Avec les vari&eacute;t&eacute;s
de riz et de bl&eacute; &agrave; haut rendement disponibles au
milieu des ann&eacute;es 1960, la R&eacute;volution verte a accru
la capacit&eacute; des pays asiatiques &agrave; r&eacute;soudre
leurs probl&egrave;mes alimentaires et assurer la stabilit&eacute;
de leur &eacute;conomie. Les &Eacute;tats qui ont su exploiter
ce potentiel avec succ&egrave;s ont alors pu acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer
le rythme de croissance &eacute;conomique. Comme le processus
de croissance &eacute;tait &agrave; l'origine centr&eacute; sur
l'&eacute;conomie rurale, la pauvret&eacute; a diminu&eacute;
rapidement.
<P>
Pour assurer la stabilit&eacute; &eacute;conomique et politique,
les gouvernements doivent se garder d'aggraver l'incertitude relative
&agrave; l'avenir. Or, les pouvoirs publics accentuent souvent
le caract&egrave;re impr&eacute;visible du futur en menant des
politiques financi&egrave;res erratiques, en intervenant de fa&ccedil;on
arbitraire dans la fixation des prix alimentaires et &eacute;nerg&eacute;tiques,
en manipulant les r&egrave;gles de base du fonctionnement du syst&egrave;me
politique. Avec un minimum de prudence, les gouvernements pourraient
&eacute;viter de renforcer l'incertitude. Mais peuvent-ils faire
mieux ? Peuvent-ils am&eacute;liorer la stabilit&eacute; interne
? Un gouvernement comp&eacute;tent peut sans doute exercer des
contraintes en d&eacute;pit de comportements de droits acquis
(c'est le cas de plusieurs gouvernements d'Asie de l'Est du Sud-Est).
Des interventions cibl&eacute;es destin&eacute;es &agrave; renforcer
la stabilit&eacute; &eacute;conomique et l'efficacit&eacute; du
syst&egrave;me politique sont possible, comme l'illustre la politique
tr&egrave;s courante de stabilisation des prix du riz.
<P>
Une fois un environnement stable &eacute;tabli, la principale
t&acirc;che du gouvernement est d'assurer le respect du principe
d'&eacute;quit&eacute; au cours du temps afin de p&eacute;renniser
la croissance &eacute;conomique. Le processus de croissance ne
se mesure pas en ann&eacute;es, mais en d&eacute;cennies et en
si&egrave;cles. Si la majorit&eacute; de la population est tenue
&agrave; l'&eacute;cart de ce processus, elle ne soutiendra pas
les politiques rigoureuses destin&eacute;es &agrave; mobiliser
l'&eacute;pargne ni l'affectation de ces ressources aux projets
d'investissement les plus rentables.
<P>
Redistribuer les revenus au moyen de taxes et d'allocations est
une r&eacute;ponse bien insuffisante &agrave; ce probl&egrave;me.
La redistribution est source de co&ucirc;ts administratifs &eacute;lev&eacute;s,
de divisions politiques et d'incitations n&eacute;gatives pour
les investisseurs. Il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable, conform&eacute;ment
&agrave; l'exp&eacute;rience de la plupart des pays d'Asie du
Sud-Est, de structurer d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but le processus
de croissance de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; r&eacute;soudre le probl&egrave;me
de la pauvret&eacute;. Cette approche oblige in&eacute;vitablement
&agrave; d&eacute;finir une strat&eacute;gie centr&eacute;e sur
les petits agriculteurs pour am&eacute;liorer la productivit&eacute;
du travail agricole. En d&eacute;finitive, le mod&egrave;le que
devraient utiliser les &eacute;conomistes pour analyser le processus
de d&eacute;veloppement renverse ainsi enti&egrave;rement le mod&egrave;le
traditionnel.

<I>L'aide financi&egrave;re internationale jouera un r&ocirc;le
crucial dans la mise en place d'une administration palestinienne
comp&eacute;tente et dans le redressement &eacute;conomique du
pays... tant qu'une r&eacute;elle dynamique d'investissement priv&eacute;
ne se mettra pas en place.</I>
<HR>
<P>
La signature de la D&eacute;claration de principes du 13 septembre
1993 constitue un jalon important dans la reconnaissance mutuelle
entre Isra&euml;l et l'Organisation de lib&eacute;ration de la
Palestine (OLP). Elle a enclench&eacute; un processus certes sinueux
et sem&eacute; d'emb&ucirc;ches mais qui, &agrave; plus ou moins
long terme, devait - tragiquement - d&eacute;boucher sur un Etat
palestinien dot&eacute; de l'essentiel des attributs de la souverainet&eacute;.
Les &eacute;v&eacute;nements qui se sont succ&eacute;d&eacute;s
depuis cette date attestent &agrave; la fois l'irr&eacute;versibilit&eacute;
du processus et la d&eacute;termination de ses adversaires &agrave;
le faire avorter.
<P>
Consciente de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de soutenir le processus
entam&eacute; &agrave; Madrid lors de la conf&eacute;rence de
1991, consolid&eacute; &agrave; Washington en septembre 1993 puis
&agrave; Taba avec l'accord d'Oslo II en 1995, la communaut&eacute;
internationale s'est mobilis&eacute;e pour promettre une aide
&eacute;conomique et prouver que la paix ne vient pas &#171;les
mains vides&#187; et qu'elle aura des retomb&eacute;es positives
sur toutes les parties. Pour Isra&euml;l d'abord, qui par le biais
d'une normalisation de ses relations avec les pays arabes et la
fin du boycott arabe verrait son &eacute;conomie prosp&eacute;rer.
Pour les Etats arabes ensuite, qui en crevant enfin cet abc&egrave;s
de fixation qu'est le conflit isra&eacute;lo-arabe devraient r&eacute;duire
leur budget militaire et pouvoir consacrer leurs maigres ressources
financi&egrave;res au d&eacute;veloppement. Et pour les Palestiniens
enfin, qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieraient d'un soutien financier
international suffisant pour installer leur administration, r&eacute;habiliter
leurs infrastructures et investir dans des projets de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
<H3>La Banque coordonne</H3>
<P>
A cet effet, une Conf&eacute;rence de soutien &agrave; la paix
au Moyen-Orient s'est tenue le 1er octobre 1993, un Comit&eacute;
de liaison <I>ad hoc</I> s'est mis en place le 5 novembre 1993,
un groupe consultatif s'est organis&eacute; le 16 d&eacute;cembre
1993. La Banque mondiale devait assumer un r&ocirc;le dirigeant
dans la mobilisation de l'aide. Mais c'est l'Union europ&eacute;enne
qui allait &ecirc;tre la principale r&eacute;gion donatrice.
<P>
De mani&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, la communaut&eacute;
internationale a promis 966 430 000 dollars pour 1994 et 721 110
000 dollars pour 1995, mais les sommes r&eacute;ellement d&eacute;bours&eacute;es
se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;es &agrave; seulement 496 770 000 dollars
en 1994 (soit 55 % de moins que les montants promis) et 262 950
000 dollars en 1995 (40 % de moins).
<P>
Ces chiffres appellent certaines remarques. La premi&egrave;re
est que la communaut&eacute; internationale n'a pas respect&eacute;
ses engagements &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des Palestiniens. La seconde
est que le pilotage de l'aide &eacute;conomique est confi&eacute;
&agrave; la Banque mondiale alors que l'Europe a fourni plus du
quart de l'aide totale en 1994 et plus de 35 % en 1995. La troisi&egrave;me
est que les organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) &eacute;trang&egrave;res
ont d&eacute;pens&eacute; des sommes modiques en Palestine (22
millions de dollars en 1994 et seulement 8 millions en 1995).
<P>
En outre, les bouclages fr&eacute;quents des enclaves urbaines
plac&eacute;es sous le contr&ocirc;le de l'Autorit&eacute; palestinienne
ont quasiment annul&eacute; les effets b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques
de l'aide publique aux territoires palestiniens. Aujourd'hui,
la situation &eacute;conomique dans ces territoires est pire qu'avant
l'accord d'Oslo I. Les exportations palestiniennes continuent
&agrave; &ecirc;tre entrav&eacute;es par l'autorit&eacute; d'occupation.
La circulation des marchandises &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de
la Cisjordanie et de Gaza est constamment contrari&eacute;e par
les couvre-feux et les bouclages. Par ailleurs, l'interdiction
faite aux travailleurs palestiniens de se rendre en Isra&euml;l
constitue un manque &agrave; gagner dont souffre toute la population.
Le co&ucirc;t de ces mesures a repr&eacute;sent&eacute; 600 millions
de dollars en 1995 et s'annonce encore plus lourd pour 1996.
<P>
<H3>D&eacute;rapages administratifs ?</H3>
<P>
Les ONG europ&eacute;ennes ont &eacute;t&eacute; particuli&egrave;rement
actives en Palestine depuis l'Intifada. Plus d'une centaine sont
impliqu&eacute;es dans diff&eacute;rents projets de d&eacute;veloppement
ou de r&eacute;habilitation. Beaucoup d'entre elles ont b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;
de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale pour financer leurs activit&eacute;s.
Certaines ont acc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; des fonds communautaires.
Leur travail a &eacute;t&eacute; facilit&eacute; par l'existence
d'un r&eacute;seau associatif particuli&egrave;rement vigoureux
en Palestine et d'ONG locales efficaces. Il est fort probable
qu'&agrave; l'avenir l'Autorit&eacute; palestinienne cherchera
&agrave; r&eacute;glementer l'action des ONG et exigera d'exercer
un plus grand contr&ocirc;le sur le choix des projets &agrave;
financer ainsi que sur la comptabilit&eacute; des ONG. Si le souci
de la transparence est l&eacute;gitime, le risque est grand de
voir la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile mise sous contr&ocirc;le
d'une autorit&eacute; tatillonne et centralisatrice.
<P>
Pour finir, l'aide publique aux Palestiniens s'est av&eacute;r&eacute;e
relativement modeste au regard des besoins. Pour l'essentiel,
elle a servi &agrave; financer les administrations, la police,
les universit&eacute;s et divers frais de fonctionnement. C'est
une situation malsaine qui ne doit pas se prolonger de fa&ccedil;on
excessive. Mais pour que les Palestiniens puissent subvenir &agrave;
leurs besoins, il est indispensable que le processus de paix d&eacute;bouche
sur une &eacute;conomie d&eacute;senclav&eacute;e et un Etat ind&eacute;pendant.
Pour l'heure, la paix arrive au compte-gouttes : une sorte de
paix au rabais...

The effects of corruption on development</h2>

<hr>
<p><b>
Corruption - defined as 'the abuse of public power for personal
ends' - has always existed. During recent decades, however, it
has grown both in terms of geographic extent and intensity. Since
the mid 1970s, it has infiltrated virtually every country in the
world.</b>
<P>
It was hoped that the easing of political and economic restrictions
that characterised the 1990s after the end of the Cold War would
have gone some way to reducing this phenomenon. Through increased
openness resulting from political pluralism and the freedom of
the press, the process of democratisation should, under normal
circumstances, mobilise efforts to overcome corruption. However,
emergent democracies are still fragile and seem to find the task
of tackling established self-interests a formidable one. 
<P>
By reducing state intervention and therefore the opportunities
for corruption, economic liberalisation should, for its part,
likewise improve matters. In the short term, however, the opposite
would appear to be true. Weakened state structures, a lack of
appropriate legislation, powerlessness on the part of the judicial
system to combat corruption, the pursuit of easy money - mistakenly
perceived by some as being equivalent to a market economy - all
these factors together contribute to aggravating the phenomenon,
at least in the transitional stages. Such a state of affairs cannot
fail to have some effect on those who are involved in and concerned
by development issues. 
<P>
Needless to say, corruption and its effects can be seen from a
multitude of viewpoints. There is always the ethical angle - but
how can we possibly presume to preach to countries of the South
and East when bribery is just as rife in the North and when, as
far as corruption within international economic relations is concerned,
it is in fact, virtually by definition, the North who is the corrupter
and the South and East who are the corrupted? The only possible
reply to such an argument - and one which is morally disputable
even though economically valid - would be that the rich North
can afford the luxury of wasting some of its wealth whereas in
the case of developing countries, their sparse financial resources
need to be used in the best way possible! Other lines of reasoning
emphasise the distortions that corruption causes in the fair application
of conditions of competition by penalising successful, yet honest,
undertakings.
<P>
<H3>A major obstacle in the path of development </H3>
<P>
In my opinion, corruption should be approached from the point
of view of the effects it has on development. I say this because
long professional experience has taught me that corruption is
one of the major obstacles to progress, and that its effects on
development are disastrous. 
<P>
Some people would no doubt counter this assertion with the 'cultural'
argument whereby they would have us believe that, in certain cultures,
corruption is quite normal and morally acceptable. Well I do not
know of a single place on earth where growing rich through taking
bribes is considered lawful or morally acceptable! I should like
to quote Olusegun Obansanjo, former President of Nigeria, on the
subject: 'In the African concept of appreciation and hospitality,
a gift is a token. It is not demanded. The value is in the spirit
of the giving, not the material worth. The gift is made in the
open for all to see, never in secret. Where the gift is excessive,
it becomes an embarrassment, and is returned. If anything, corruption
has perverted the positive aspects of this age-old tradition'.

<P>
Then there are the cynics - including renowned professors - who
claim that corruption oils the wheels of progress and enables
development to take place. In this respect again, and putting
all ethical aspects aside, it would be worthwhile distinguishing
between the small baksheesh which 'helps' certain administrative
procedures along ('acceleration fees') and large-scale corruption
which perverts the course of development. This does not of course
mean to say that we should underestimate the destructive effects
that even small-scale corruption can have on society! 
<P>
Yet others have simply resigned themselves to the situation. For
them, corruption is intrinsically linked to underdevelopment.
As long as a person's normal income does not provide him with
a decent living, the door will always be open to bribes. It is,
therefore, through development that we should be attempting to
eradicate corruption. Yet this argument is reminiscent of the
debate on the population explosion. It is only through development,
some say, that the problems of population growth will be resolved.
But by then, the planet will be inexorably overpopulated! In my
opinion, the same argument is just as valid as far as corruption
is concerned. We simply cannot wait for it to be stamped out through
development. (In any case, development is hardly a miracle cure:
true, we have the examples of Singapore and Hong Kong where corruption
is extremely uncommon, but we could also mention Italy, where
it was precisely at the height of the country's development that
corruption became the norm). We must act therefore, and without
delay, focusing our efforts on eradicating large-scale corruption.

<P>
If we analyse some of the effects that corruption has on development,
the first thing we notice is that it increases the cost of goods
and services, and not insignificantly either. Although a 5% reduction
in the profit margin might, at a pinch, be absorbed by the supplier,
corruption levels of 10% to 20%, which have become commonplace,
will inevitably be reflected in the price and will, consequently,
be paid for through the national or foreign (in the case of foreign
aid) resources of a country. It is therefore the national economy
that ultimately suffers the consequences of an unjustified surcharge
on the goods or services, with the difference being pocketed by
some government official or politician who has abused his power
for his own personal gain. Given that such operations are generally
financed by bank loans or, in the case of foreign aid, by concessional
loans, these surcharges inevitably bring about a proportionate
increase in that country's debts. In fact it is now assumed that
the exchange value of sums paid out in backhanders makes up a
considerable proportion of the foreign debts of developing countries.

<P>
However, the damaging effects of such practices do not stop there.
The corrupt decision-maker may well be tempted to accept a substandard
quality of service which will make his personal profit all the
greater. Thus, with a road-building project for example, complicity
between government departments and contractors may result in corner-cutting
with regard to agreed standards of quality so that the savings
made may be shared out between the two parties. 
<P>
At their very worst, the disastrous effects of corruption mean
that the conception of a project, and ultimately its very choice,
are determined by corruption. As far as conception is concerned,
a good example would be the purchase of a technology which is
wholly unsuited to the particular needs of a country or the choice
of a capital-intensive project - more lucrative in terms of corruption
- rather than a labour-intensive one which would nevertheless
be far more beneficial to that nation's development. 
<P>
The absolute peak of perversion, however, is when the very choice
of priorities - and therefore of projects - is determined by corruption.
What we are referring to here are those situations in which the
real development priorities of a country are neglected in favour
of operations which generate the greatest personal gain for the
decision-makers. At this point I would like to quote R&eacute;mi
Godeau, writing in Jeune Afrique: 'These currency-guzzling abortive
projects have become a graveyard of white elephants. Africa is
littered with vast deserted motorways which are being eroded by
the savannah, with fully functional but empty factories which
have been left to fall into ruin only a few years after they were
opened, with railway lines which are now impassable through a
lack of maintenance, and with hydroelectric dams abandoned because
they cost too much to run'. Let us pick up on the point about
empty factories. These 'follies of development' are to be found
in many developing countries and in Africa in particular. Some
have never produced, others have failed to reach full production
capacity while others still face such prohibitive costs that big
state subsidies are needed to keep them going. If we follow the
thread right back to the beginning we find, more often than not,
that factories have been sold without ensuring real competition
between suppliers. Admittedly, such projects usually have only
private-sector backing (they are rarely financed through official
aid), but the funding is nonetheless backed by state-controlled
bodies. The existence of corruption in such cases must be more
than mere presumption - what other reason could there be for making
decisions which run so counter to the interests of development?
In his work 'Grand Corruption in Third World Development', George
Moody-Stuart identified those areas which are especially vulnerable
to corruption. These are most notably, the procurement of military
and other technically sophisticated equipment, and large-scale
works (in other words, any major, capital-intensive project and
any scheme where objective valuation and comparison is hampered
because of the technical sophistication involved). 
<P>
It is worthwhile mentioning at this point that a country which
borrows money to finance projects that do not satisfy its real
needs, and which may indeed be considered economically futile
or absurd, will see its debt burden increase - and not simply
by the 10% to 20% that is used to fund 'backhanders'. The loss
will ultimately be 100% if one views it in terms of the cost of
the unproductive investment to the national economy. Discussions
about the debts of developing countries rarely focus on the mechanisms
which have produced these debts. Yet in most cases, they have
become unserviceable on account of the ineffective use of overseas
aid - the sort of bad management to which corruption contributes
considerably. 
<P>
What is more, by deflecting the sparse resources which do exist
towards non-priority or low-priority areas, corruption contributes
to a large extent to ensuring that fundamental needs such as food,
health and education, are not met. It is therefore one of the
causes of underdevelopment and of poverty in general. Needless
to say, official aid is often called upon to make good the deficit
left by the irresponsible management of otherwise available resources.
Is it any surprise if, in the long run, public opinion in the
countries of the North begins to grow weary of bridging gaps which
efficient management of resources should never have allowed to
appear in the first place? How are we to convince European taxpayers
that it is they who need to provide the money to fund bush clinics
in countries which invest their funds in prestige projects, if
not directly into Swiss bank accounts?
<P>
<H3>A vicious circle that must be broken </H3>
<P>
Effectively, we find ourselves in a 'catch-22' situation. Corruption
is one of the causes of underdevelopment and poverty, yet poverty
is in part responsible for its continuation. If a person cannot
earn an honest living for himself and his family, then he is more
or less forced into earning it by less honest means. Hence corruption
is both the cause and the consequence of underdevelopment. In
order to break the pattern we must therefore combat large-scale
corruption inasmuch as it is a significant cause of underdevelopment
and we must work gradually to eradicate the reasons for its propagation
in society, and in particular to remedy the notorious lack of
adequate income to ensure a decent standard of living. 
<P>
In general terms, we can say that corruption also kills off the
spirit of development. Nothing is more destructive to a society
than the pursuit of 'a fast and easy buck' which makes honest
people who work hard appear naive or foolish. That is why, in
the context of economic reforms under the heading of 'structural
adjustment', it is vital that the model advocated be one of a
market economy based on a sound framework of legislation and on
an efficient state. It should not allow free rein to the sort
of ruthless capitalism which is aimed at immediate profit at all
costs. The example of certain transition countries in the East,
where a market economy has become synonymous with the law of the
jungle, the Mafia and corruption, really should make us stop and
think. 
<P>
In the final analysis, an economy undermined by corruption has
the effect of discouraging potential foreign investors and public
donors. Yet if development is to succeed, countries have to be
able to attract a flow of capital. As Serge Michailof put it:
'Success attracts money. Waste, failure and chaos drive it away'.
And although investors are very keen to do business, with the
exception of a few opportunists, they all look for host countries
that have a stable and predictable climate. Entrepreneurs have
been known to withdraw from certain African countries - which
are nevertheless rich in resources - because of the constraints
imposed on them by corruption on a scale which they considered
to be unacceptable. As for public donors, they are increasingly
reluctant to offer financial aid to those countries that manage
their own resources poorly. It is precisely this failing which
is one of the causes of what we now refer to as 'aid fatigue'.
Financial aid institutions should go as far as suspending their
cooperation in blatant cases of corruption and bad management,
just as they do in cases of serious violation of human rights.
Conversely, 'good governance' should be the determining factor
when allocating aid, and it would appear that Article 5 of the
revised Lom&eacute; IV Convention does in fact foresee such an
approach. 
<P>
In conclusion, far from reserving the foregoing criticisms for
countries of the South, I believe that the partners of the North
have their part to play in the ravages wrought by corruption,
be it only as a result of the inconsistencies between their development
cooperation policies and their export promotion policies. Basing
our assumptions on the principle that cooperation efforts are
genuinely motivated by concerns for development - and I can attest
that this is precisely the motivation behind the policies of the
European Union, which I have served for a great many years - we
should not forget that Western countries have a tendency to promote
exports, by other means, without any consideration for the effects
this has in terms of development. They thus contribute to the
dishonest practices which we have been discussing. The fact that
they tolerate, or even go as far as to encourage, corruption as
a means of promoting exports - restricting the application of
the criminal law to acts committed on their own territory and
allowing corruption to be tax-deductible under the heading of
'necessary expenses' - seems to me to be absolutely scandalous.
In the North too, the battle against the canker of international
corruption is a formidable one. But it is a fight to which we
are committed in the context of 'Transparency International'.
This NGO, which was created in 1993, makes its services available
to any country which genuinely wishes to eradicate the scourge
of corruption.

<hr>
<p>
<B>When a highly qualified professional chooses to leave his own country
for another, he does so for one or several legitimate political or economic
reasons: peace and security for himself and his family, job satisfaction,
better pay and conditions, a higher standard of living, etc. Throughout
history, countries and centres of academic excellence which offer these
attractions have received the largest numbers of professional migrants and
these have, in turn, made substantial contributions, not only to the economic
growth of their host countries, but also to the scientific and technological
advancement of humanity. The wave of German scientists who moved to the
United States after the Second World war, and their discoveries and
inventions, come readily to mind. On a global level, therefore, the free
movement and interaction of highly skilled people is a positive thing. But the
costs to the home countries of losing their professionals is incalculable - in
terms of both development opportunities and loss of investment.</b>
<p>
     Whereas Western Europe was the main loser, especially to the United
States, up until the 1960s, the developing countries have emerged in recent years
as the biggest suppliers of qualified professionals to the industrialised world as a
whole. Today there are more than a million and a half skilled expatriates from the
developing countries settled in Western Europe, the USA, Japan and Canada. The
USA's educational system and its research institutions are heavily dependent on
them. These migrant professionals contribute in no small way to increasing the
disparities between the world's rich and poor nations. And it is the developing
countries that need them most.
<p>
     Africa, which has serious shortages of manpower, has been worst hit. It is
said to have lost 60 000 professionals (doctors, university lecturers, engineers,
surveyors, etc) between 1985 and 1990 and to have been losing an average of
20 000 annually ever since.
<p>
     There are more than 21 000 Nigerian doctors practising in the United States
alone. Meanwhile, Nigeria's own health system suffers a cruel lack of medical
practitioners. 60% of all Ghanaian doctors trained locally in the 1980s have left the
country, according to the UNDP's 1992 Human Development report, while, in
Sudan, 17% of doctors and dentists, 20% of university lecturers, 30% of engineers
and 45% of surveyors have gone to work abroad.
<p>
     Although it is difficult to calculate the cost of an expatriate professional in
terms of the nutrition, health care and education provided by households and the
State, it is clear developing countries are losing colossal amounts of investment
annually to the developed countries.
<p>
     The US Congressional Research Service, for example, computed in 1971-
72 that the USA gained $20 000 annually on each skilled migrant from the
developing countries. If this rather conservative amount is extrapolated for Africa,
then the continent lost more than $1.2 billion of investment between 1985 and
1990 on the 60 000 or so African professionals who emigrated during that period.
Much closer perhaps to the truth today would be the estimate made by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), using 1979 prices
which put a cash value of $184 000 on each African professional migrant (and this
only for those between the ages of 25 and 35).
<p>
     On the other hand, expatriate remittances, particularly from skilled workers
who earn higher salaries than the average migrant, constitute an important source
of funds for development in their home countries. Throughout Africa, households
are being maintained by remittances from relatives working abroad. Also, fine
buildings are being put up and small-scale projects are financed in villages and
cities across the continent with funds sent from overseas. But taken together,
these will never be large enough to compensate Africa for the loss of investment
suffered as a result of the 'brain drain'.
<p>
<H3>Serious flaw in international cooperation</H3>
<p>
     The migration of highly qualified professionals from the developing countries
is an extremely complex problem which presents the international community with
a major dilemma. First of all, the 'brain drain' cannot be stopped by force nor can
it be legislated against. It is linked to fundamental human rights - the right of
individuals to move from one country to another, although the exercise of that right
is governed by the immigration policies of individual countries. Second, it is
fundamentally a national problem which can only be resolved at the national level
by providing enough incentives for qualified nationals to remain at home. Third,
some industrialised countries like the United States and Canada, have historically
operated liberal immigration policies. Even European states, whose immigration
policies tend to be more restrictive, have a good number of third world
professionals, but there are over a million in the USA and Canada. It is arguable
whether, under the circumstances, the liberalisation of the international labour
market under the World Trade Organisation, as is being suggested (even by some
developing countries), will actually be in Africa's interests.
<p>
     The reasons for Africa's brain drain problem are legion and easily
identifiable, being both structural and economic. The most often cited cause is the
continent's school curricula which many see as still largely modelled on the
systems of the former colonial masters. This, it is argued, has led to the
production of graduates in disciplines that have little or no relevance to the socio-
cultural and economic milieux of the continent. This is a highly debatable
assertion, given the large numbers of the technical assistants currently working in
Africa who are products of the educational systems of the former colonial powers -
at least some of whom are having a positive impact on the continent's
development. This, however, must not distract from the fact that African higher
schools systems are ill-equipped to produce the right skills for Africa's
development needs. Because of shortages of both science equipment and
teachers, the system instructs the vast majority of pupils in arts rather than in
science and technology  - and it is the latter which hold the key to economic
growth and development. Thus, there is overproduction of graduates in areas
where there are few employment opportunities. This results in high levels of
migration, even, paradoxically among the few trained scientists because of the
absence of an environment conducive to full professional expression and
satisfaction. It is not uncommon for things as simple as electricity and water
supply to provide reasons for emigration. Examples abound of frustrated African
scientists who have had their experimental work of several years destroyed
overnight through power failures.
<p>
     Powerful factors in the brain drain include Africa's poor rates of economic
growth over the past 30 years (worsened by structural adjustment measures which
have resulted in dramatic falls in living standards) and political instability
(disturbances in Nigeria and Zaire, civil war in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Somalia
etc). Thousands of qualified professionals have been forced unwillingly into exile,
and the majority of those left behind, in these times of serious economic crisis, are
engaged in unskilled pursuits - in petty trading and taxi driving - far removed from
their professional training. The loss of investment associated with this situation
cannot be underestimated. The effect on households who have paid taxes and
made sacrifices for years to educate their children, and on the States which have
invested in educational systems, are huge.
<p>
     Sub-Saharan Africa is in the paradoxical situation today of having large
numbers of graduates in various disciplines - from medicine and engineering to
architecture and accountancy - who have either emigrated or are simply
unemployed, while it hosts a large army of foreign technical assistants. Indeed,
Africa receives more advice per capita than any other continent. In 1988, there
were more than 80 000 technical assistants, and today the figure is well over
100 000. These experts are believed to cost donors a total of $4bn annually to
maintain, a figure which represents nearly 35% of Africa's total official
development aid. This situation reveals a serious flaw in the operation of
international development cooperation. Would it not be more efficient and cost-
effective to employ qualified African expatriates in the place of many of these
foreign technical experts. The former, after all, have both linguistic and cultural
links with the continent. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has
a programme in this area which points to a possible way forward.

<a name="int"><h3>Introduction</h3></a><p>
<b>Together, the EU and its Member States provide more than 50% of global
development aid. The Union, however, is rarely perceived as being the world's
largest donor. This is because the development policies of the Community
(representing about 15% of the total funding) and of individual member countries
have tended to operate independently. With the passage of the Maastricht Treaty
on European Union in 1993, this situation is now gradually changing.</b>
<p>
      Although the Community has been involved in development cooperation
since 1957, European development policy has only recently been given a specific
legal basis. The new Title XVII of the EC Treaty formalises the existence of such
a policy, operating alongside those of the Member States. It also recognises their
interdependence, establishing policy objectives and providing instruments to
achieve them. In this context, Article 130u states that the Community's
development policy 'shall be complementary to the policies (of) the Member States'
while Article 130x requires the Community and its Member States to coordinate
policy in this area. The term 'complementarity' first cropped up in Council
Resolutions on development during the 1970s and 1980s but its exact meaning
only began to be seriously debated after 'Maastricht'. The reasons included the fact
that development aid was coming under growing criticism and new funds had to
be found for cooperation with other countries. There was also, of course, the fact
that the policy had obtained a more formal status in the European framework, and
in this connection, some EU countries were keen to define more closely the border
between bilateral and EC development cooperation.
<p>
      At the Council's request, the Commission issued a communication on 
complementarity and in June 1995, the Council adopted a Resolution on the same
subject ('Complementarity between the development policies and actions of the
Union and those of the Member States'). The Parliament is presently preparing its
own report.
<p>
<h3><a name="mis">Misconceptions</a></h3>
<p>
      The concept of complementarity has obviously been discussed at length by
the various parties. With development budgets under pressure, a number of Union
members sought to justify a possible diversion of funds from the EC to bilateral aid.
There was a concern that complementarity might result in the Commission gaining
control over national programmes. Others, by contrast, feared a 'renationalisation'
of European development cooperation. The interpretations of 'complementarity that
emerged from this process included the following:
<ul>
<li>specialisation of tasks between Member States and the Union, whether based on
the existence of comparative advantages or not;
<li>a 'one way street' whereby only the EU would have to 'complement' Member
State activities, without any reciprocal obligation;
<li>that it should be considered in the light of the subsidiarity principle, as set out in
Article 3b of the EC Treaty.
</ul>
<p>
      On this last point, it should be noted that complementarity and subsidiarity
are two very different concepts. Subsidiarity relates to the division of competences,
and entails decisions being taken at the most appropriate level. Complementarity
relates to the use of established competences and requires that decisions taken by
different participants within the field of their own powers, are consistent with each
other. As the Commission has stated, there can be no complementarity if the basic
philosophies, objectives and policies of the EU and its Member States diverge.
Complementarity requires, moreover, that shared objectives are translated into
common sectoral policies, that a common view is reached on the needs of the
developing countries, and that activities are closely coordinated. Accordingly, it
cannot be seen as a 'one way street' and must involve active Member State
participation - with consequences for their own bilateral policies.
<p>
      Complementarity thus involves a partnership of equals. EU countries cannot
force the Commission to support or participate in national schemes, although such
participation is not excluded. Similarly, the EC Treaty provides for Member States
to 'contribute if necessary to the implementation of Community aid programmes'.
Nor does complementarity entail specialisation involving a formal division of tasks
between the various actors, although one should clearly take advantage of the
strengths of the different parties. If a certain Member State or the Commission, for
example, has particular experience in education in Tanzania, why not let it take the
lead in that area?
<p>
<h3><a name="wha">What complementarity is about</a></h3>
<p>
      Despite the EU's leading role in global aid provision, the advantages of this
critical mass have not so far been reaped. The results of operating largely
independently have included unnecessary overlaps, work duplication and even
conflicting activities. There is general agreement that the way to achieve greater
collective effectiveness is through coordination, as foreseen in the aforementioned
Article 130x (which gives the Commission the role of initiator). The potential
advantages are numerous. For example, duplication could be reduced through joint
studies, evaluations or projects. There could be more efficient resource allocation
through the effective use of specific expertise, and economies of scale could be
achieved. Policies decided jointly should be easier to implement. The EU's collective
position vis-a-vis recipients and other donors would be strengthened. Finally, the
administrative burden on developing countries would be reduced - instead of
dealing with 16 separate donors, they can deal with them as one.
<p>
<h3><a name="has">What has Happened Since Maastricht</a></h3>
      Since 1992, there has been some progress in achieving coherence between
EU and national policies. In 1992, the Member States issued a declaration on
'Aspects of Development Cooperation Policy in the run up to 2000' which accepted
that the principles established for EU development policy in the EC Treaty applied
equally to their own bilateral policies. They also agreed to enhance coordination at
the policy and operational levels as well as in international fora. A number of
sectoral policies have since been harmonised, providing guidelines which are
applicable both to the Commission and to national development agencies. In the
area of operational coordination guidelines have been agreed and six 'pilot'
countries have been chosen with a view to gaining practical experience. 
<p>
<h4>Structured coordination</h4>
<p>
      Considering that Member State/EC coordination was still too ad hoc, the
Council agreed with the Commission on a more structured approach. In December
1993, procedures for coordination between the Community and its Member States
were laid down and the Resolution of 1 June 1995 details ways of achieving this.
<p>
<h4>Policy coordination</h4>
      In the past, Member States meeting in Council established EU sectoral
policies which were only applicable to the Commission. This is now changing, with
recent guidelines also applying to national development agencies. So far common
guidelines have been agreed in four areas: poverty alleviation, health, education and
food security. These are to apply in EU dealings with all developing states, but, in
the meantime, a number of pilot countries have been selected to gain experience
with coordinated implementation in specific sectors. The results should benefit
coordination in all developing countries. In the Resolution, Member States
expressed satisfaction with this process, and indicated that it should continue. The
Commission will identify further sectors to be considered.
<p>
      In practice, policy coordination functions as follows. Proposed guidelines are
drafted by the Commission in close liaison with national experts in the sector. They
are then adopted by the Council, usually in the form of a Resolution. Coordination
of implementation will take place primarily in the developing countries, but the
management committees (EDF/ALA/MED) also have a role. The national experts are
asked to follow implementation of the guidelines and discuss possible updating or
amendments with the Commission. The latter eventually decides whether or not
to propose modifications to the Council.
<p>
<h4>Coordination in forward planning</h4>
      The establishment of country strategies (NIPs under Lom&#233;) is an
important phase in the process. These provide guidelines for action in a specific
country over a certain period of time. To achieve complementarity at this level, the
different approaches need to be coherent; something which implies coordination.
Community strategies have always been discussed with Member States in the
management committees. Thus, for example, internal financing agreements under
Lom&#233; have had to be examined in the context of overall EU strategy and to
ensure consistency and complementarity with aid provided by Member States. By
contrast, national strategies have barely figured in these meetings. The Commission
therefore proposed that these should also be looked at within the framework of
discussions on EU strategies. The Council endorsed this in its Resolution.
<p>
      Coordination of country strategies has particular significance given the
forthcoming programming phase for the 8th EDF. The first step is the drafting of
a document by the Commission delegate in each ACP state setting out the strategy
for the EC's cooperation with that country. The main purpose is to determine areas
where the Community might usefully make a contribution, taking account of the
activities of other donors (including, in particular, the Member States). The
Commission has issued instructions to its delegates to coordinate with Member
States on the spot in order to establish a common view on the development
strategy of the country concerned and on the major constraints, as well as to
identify the most efficient way in which the EU can intervene.
<p>
<h4>Coordination in international fora</h4>
      In contrast to the common commercial policy (where the EC has exclusive
competence), development cooperation is an area where the Community and 
Member States enjoy parallel or 'mixed' competences. This means that, while the
Commission normally represents the EU in international trade discussions, they
operate, in principle, side by side in the development cooperation area. Indeed, the
Treaty stipulates at Article 130x that Member States and the Commission should
also coordinate their activities in international organisations and at international
conferences. This is designed to ensure that they take the same position, thus
facilitating their work at these meetings. More importantly it ensures coherence
between what has been decided within the Union and the positions to be taken
outside. Progress is being made in this area, in the sense that positions for
international conferences such as the recent Rio and Cairo summits were
coordinated in advance. The same approach is used for Consultative Group and
Round Table meetings. Unfortunately the Member States' political will to coordinate
is still lacking in some areas - notably where the Bretton Woods institutions are
involved. Those EU countries with direct representation in the World Bank and IMF
show little enthusiasm for coordination, although there are a few exceptions. Thus,
for example, effective coordination does take place in the Special Assistance
Programme for LDCs sub-Saharan Africa.
<p>
      Given the importance of the Bretton Woods institutions (notably, the World
Bank) in the development field, the positions taken by the EU Member States in
these fora ought to be closely coordinated, and to follow policy lines jointly
established in the Union. Currently, EU countries have about 28% of the votes on
the Executive Board of the World Bank. Germany, France and the UK (all permanent
members) have roughly 13% while the others pool their individual voting rights,
mainly with third states. The Netherlands, for example, 'shares' a seat with
Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine. It would
seem logical for EU countries without a permanent seat to pool their efforts as far
as possible.
<p>
      In addition, the Commission only has observer status on the World Bank's
Board of Governors and advisory development committee. Given that the EU is
(collectively) the largest donor, consideration should perhaps be given to giving it
representation in its own right. This is already the situation at the equivalent level
of the FAO.
<p>
<h4>Operational coordination</h4>
      Operational coordination relates to the implementation of policies and
strategies. In its Resolution of December 1993 on 'procedures for coordination
between the Community and its Member States', the Council stated that extensive
coordination was desirable in the development policy field. As with sectoral policy
coordination, the Council selected a number of countries to gain experience in this
area. A progress report on operational coordination in these countries has been
submitted by the Commission to the Council. The conclusions in the final report,
due by the end of the year, should help to achieve more effective operational
coordination in all developing countries. Initial experience points to only limited
interest, on the part of some Member States, in participating in this coordination.
This appears particularly to be the case in those countries where coordination is
already taking place in a wider context, including non-EU donors. Follow-up of
coordination on the ground, at the level of the national capitals, has not always
been satisfactory.
<p>
      In certain countries, some coordination already takes place, but it has been
limited to specific sectors (for example, the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport
Programme). This often includes donors from outside the EU. These efforts are
worthwhile and should be continued. So long as they work efficiently, the purpose
of specific EU coordination may appear limited. There are, however, three key
reasons why the latter should happen. First, coordination is required to put into
practice the common guidelines agreed in Brussels. Second, the Member States and
the Commission are in a stronger position if they work collectively rather than as
16 individual players. Third, the fact that the 16 speak with one voice will
obviously help facilitate wider coordination in the donor community.
<p>
      Responsibility for coordination on the spot, in specific sectors, is presently
being divided between Member States and Commission. The reason for this is a
practical one, namely a shortage of suitable personnel. From an institutional
standpoint, however, it is the Commission that has the task of coordinating (Article
130x of the EC Treaty) and if it is effectively to fulfil its role as initiator of
proposals, it is important that it should be able to exercise its responsibility in the
field. Thus, while for practical purposes, coordination in specific sectors can be
delegated to individual Member States, the overall coordination should, in the final
analysis, be the job of the Commission.
<p>
<h3><a name="eva">Evaluation and working methods</a></h3>
      Learning from experience is important in improving collective effectiveness.
With this in mind, the Commission proposed joint evaluations of EC and bilateral
Member State development policies. EU countries agree on the importance of
evaluation, but some have been less enthusiastic about bringing their bilateral aid
into the process. The utility of such evaluations has, however, been recognised by
the Council (in its Resolution of 1 June 1995). 
<p>
      The new approach described above should eventually have consequences for
Member State and EU working methods. If increased coordination is to function
well, the decision-making structures of Member States and the Community have
to be compatible with each other. Coordination in the field, for example, loses
much of its impact if those on the ground have no effective input into decisions
taken in their capitals. At national level, there also needs to be effective
coordination or, better still, integration, between those involved in EU policy-
making, and those responsible for bilateral programmes. Similarly, bilateral
strategies should be discussed more openly within the EU framework. These are
all themes which feature in the recent Council Resolution, which also suggests
greater compatibility between the decision-making powers of national and EU
delegations.
<p>
      The adaptation of working methods is always cumbersome. In the area of
development cooperation, it will certainly demand time and effort. Such adaptations
are possible, however, as Sweden recently illustrated when it integrated three 
services - responsible for development cooperation, industrial cooperation and
technical assistance - into a single service.
<p>
<h3><a name="con">Conclusion</a></h3>
      The Member States and the Community have only just begun the process of
increased coordination - which should ultimately lead to a coherent development
policy in Europe. The process is necessarily lengthy and must be undertaken one
step at a time. It requires, in particular, an extra initial effort from all those
involved. Because political commitment is needed, there is always the possibility
that things will be held up. Some people, perhaps fearing a loss of control over
national policies, may be reticent. But there appears to be no viable alternative.
Closer coordination is the logical consequence of continuing EU integration and few
would dispute the desirability of the aim - which is to achieve greater collective
effectiveness in development policy. This is surely something which both the
European taxpayer and our developing country partners have a right to expect.

<P>

<A NAME="int"><H3>2.1  INTRODUCTION</H3></A>

<p>

It is universally acknowledged that education is the force that

will, more than any other, shape the future of a society or a

nation.  Education has long been recognised by Irish people as

a worthwhile end in itself but also as the sine qua non for

effective participation in society and as a referent for change

and development of society.  It is for these reasons that

education has always been a priority sector for Irish ODA and for

Irish missionaries and NGOs.

<p>

The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) felt it appropriate,

therefore, to undertake a study on education and development at

this time, and to work towards the development of a clear policy

on Irish Aid educational assistance to developing countries.

<p>

As outlined in Section One of this Report - IAAC commissioned a

study by Ms Cathy Gaynor entitled Irish Aid and Education:

Strategic Challenges, which was followed by a Consultative

Seminar which debated and discussed issues pertinent to the

future development of Irish Aid to education in developing

countries.  In this Section, IAAC presents their considered

opinion and recommendations following discussion of the

consultant's report and the views expressed during the ensuing

consultative process.  This Section prioritizes key issues, makes

specific recommendations and identifies further steps in the

process towards an effective Irish Aid policy on educational

assistance to developing countries, in line with overall

priorities set for Irish Aid in the Strategy Plan of 1993.

<p>

<A NAME="eff"><H3>2.2  EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF IRISH AID</H3></A>

<p>

Given the expansion in the Irish Aid budget and the high level

of bilateral aid expenditure on education, it is now appropriate

and timely to analyze the human resource implications for Irish

Aid of developing and implementing a policy on education.  

<p>

It would be appropriate that a locus within the Irish Aid office

be established with overall responsibility for policy and

projects across the education sector.  This "locus" could take

of the form of an education advisor(s), with expertise in

education, located in Irish Aid; who would be supported by a

voluntary Steering Committee on aid to education - possibly a

sub-committee of IAAC. 

<p>

This "locus" would have the responsibility for the continuing

development and implementation of overall education policy in

Irish Aid. Such a policy will, of necessity, be flexible in

nature and will continually evolve and adapt to meet changing

situations both here and in host countries. 

<p>

Other areas of work for such a "locus" would be the initiation

of on-going consultation and dialogue, in host countries and in

Ireland, on educational policy development and strategies for

implementation, (including between multi-lateral and bilateral

aid and NGOs); the development of better instruments for

assessing, monitoring and evaluating education projects and

programmes supported by Irish Aid; and the monitoring of all

funding for educational projects and programmes to ensure that

the criteria for aid allocation are consistent with overall

policy and principles of Irish Aid to education.

<p>

The initial strategy in the development of a comprehensive policy

should be the adoption of this current Report as a starting point

for developing principles and priorities for Irish Aid

involvement in education.

<p>



<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 1</H4>

<p>

     - that a permanent structure on education in Irish Aid be

     established with responsibility for:

          a)  continually evolving and developing Irish Aid

          policy on education;

          b) monitoring criteria for all aid allocation to

          education projects and programmes;

          c) establishing effective procedures for the

          continuous monitoring and evaluation of education

          projects and programmes supported by Irish Aid;

          d) developing structures and strategies to facilitate

          networking and collaboration between all those

          involved in education in the developing world.

<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 2</H4>

<p>

     - that this Report from IAAC, which is based on Ms Cathy

     Gaynor's study and the ensuing consultative process, be

     adopted as the starting point for the development of a

     comprehensive policy on education in Irish Aid. 

<p>



<H3>2.3  EDUCATION IN THE IRISH AID PROGRAMME</H3>

<p>

Throughout the consultative process, there has been agreement on

one central theme, namely the role of education in the

development of communities and nations, and the need to make the

right to education a reality for all of the world's citizens.

<p>

The development of the capabilities of individuals through formal

and non-formal education is essential to the overall process of

capacity building in developing countries and thereby to the

process of sustainable social and economic development. In light

of this, the current substantial level of Irish Aid to education

should be maintained, even in an expanding aid budget. 

Furthermore, a broad spectrum of education indicators should

continue to be a major consideration in the selection of

countries for Irish Aid assistance.

<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 3</H4>

<p>

     - that the current level of Irish Aid support to education

     projects and programmes be maintained.

<p>



<p>

<A NAME="pri"><H3>2.4  PRIORITIES FOR IRISH AID TO EDUCATION</H3></A>

<p>

All indicators point to the need for ongoing dialogue and debate

on the nature and proportion of Irish Aid by level of education

and, while this should be based on country specific needs, there

must be development of an overall Irish Aid strategy in this

regard.

<p>

This strategy should continue to place major emphasis on primary

& basic education.

<p>

In this context, it should be remembered that provision of basic

education includes support for projects and programmes aimed at

reaching those whom the formal education system has failed, ie.

non-formal education interventions.  There is ongoing debate as

to whether official Irish Aid should directly support non-formal

educational interventions, or whether it should concentrate its

efforts on building up and improving the formal education

institutions of the host country.  Two points must be made in

this context: 

<p>

     i) Many educationalists believe that non-formal education

     has contributed significantly to democratic practice and

     development in the developing world and a wealth of

     information and experience exists among NGOs regarding non-

     formal education theory and practice.  There is, however,

     clearly a need to further clarify the complimentary roles

     of formal and non-formal education and a study similar to

     that undertaken by Ms Cathy Gaynor (which focused largely

     on the formal education sector) should now be undertaken

     with specific reference to the non-formal sector education. 

     This study should analyze the need for non-formal education

     in developing countries, examine current Irish involvement

     in non-formal education, both official and non-

     governmental, and should identify future strategy and

     policy for Irish Aid support for non-formal education. 

<p>

     ii) Irish Aid support for NGOs engaging in non-formal

     educational activities should be strengthened.

<p>

While support for basic education must be kept high on the

political agenda, there is just argument which views education

as a holistic process with all levels inter-linked.  Logically,

in an education system, secondary and tertiary levels of

education are important for effective delivery of primary

education (eg. for the training of teachers) and for building the

capacity needed to plan and manage educational development. 

Furthermore, in the wider development spectrum, capacity building

and sustainable development will never be achieved without the

higher levels of education being supported.  In light of this,

support for secondary education and tertiary education should be

decided on a country-specific basis, taking into account national

and regional needs and demands.

<p>

With regard to higher education, Irish Aid must be seen to

support ways of increasing access by disadvantaged groups,

including women, to higher education.

<p>



 <H4>    RECOMMENDATION 4:</H4>

 

     - that Irish Aid to education should place major emphasis

     on support for primary and basic education.

<p>



<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 5:</H4>

<p>

     - that support for secondary and tertiary education be

     maintained where necessary and appropriate.

<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 6: </H4>

<p>

     - that a study be undertaken on non-formal education in

     developing countries and that the importance of non-formal

     education continue to be recognised by strengthening

     support for NGOs engaged in non-formal educational

     activities.

<p>

  Also at higher level, Irish Aid should support teacher

education programmes and mechanisms and structures for improved

management of education.  In line with this, a proportion of the

fellowship budget should 

be allocated to fellowships which directly support strengthening

of the education system. Also with regard to fellowships, the

process for selection of fellows should be critically analyzed,

local and regional centres of training and research should be

strengthened and the value and effectiveness of returned fellows

to host countries should be monitored.

<p>



<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 7: </H4>

<p>

     - that a proportion of the fellowship budget be allocated

     to fellowships which directly support the education system

     in developing countries and that the fellowship scheme be

     continually monitored to ensure its effectiveness.

<p>

Other areas of educational intervention which should be

considered by Irish Aid include - educational provision for pre-

school children, remedial and special education and education of

refugees and displaced peoples.

<p>

In summary, however, while the holistic rather than sectoral

approach to education is laudable, the limited nature of Irish

Aid resources must be borne in mind, hence a policy on Irish Aid

and education must identify specific areas for prioritization in

order that the focus can be on the quality and relevance of the

education provided and that develop coherent strategies can be

developed under a broad policy umbrella.  It must also

acknowledge the need for dialogue and co-ordination between the

major donors to education in developing countries.  Irish Aid

should also seek to exert influence on multi-lateral agencies,

especially the EU and UN, in relation to allocation of support

for education - particularly where the policies of multi-lateral

agencies inhibit or compromise the effectiveness of Irish Aid

programmes.  There must also be active Irish Aid participation

in efforts to develop EU policy on education and training in

developing countries and to co-ordinate member state activities

in this field.

       

<p>

<A NAME="key"><H3>2.5  KEY PRINCIPLES IN IRISH AID TO EDUCATION</H3></A>

<p>

All Irish Aid support for education should be based on three

principles:

<p>

- an increase in host countries capacity to plan and manage    

  education;

- improvement in educational access and equity; and 

- improvement in the quality of education.

<p>

Regardless of the level or type of educational intervention,

these three key principles, vital to effective aid allocation,

should be borne in mind at all times.  

<p>

All Irish Aid supported educational projects should be reviewed

and appraised with the aim of promoting greater access for girls

and women to education systems and higher female continuation

rates.  Furthermore, reporting on efforts and achievements in

relation to redressing gender imbalance should be mandatory for

all education and training projects.    

<p>

In terms of capacity-building, Irish Aid should support the

provision of teacher training, educational institutional

development and support for development of a favourable education

policy environment.  In this regard, the shift away from long-

term Irish technical assistance towards the use of short-term

highly-skilled consultants should continue with greater use being

made of host country skills and expertise.  

<p>

Also in the area of capacity building and partnership, host

countries should be supported to identify and analyze the

educational needs of their country in partnership with local

people's organisations (to ensure that the needs of local

communities are expressed in the needs of Government).  

<p>

It should also be ensured that control of programmes is held by

the recipients of aid rather than by the donors and that host

country priorities always take precedence in the identification

of educational interventions.  However, in this regard, Irish Aid

should also strive to ensure acceptance and application of the

principles of gender equity, capacity development and partnership

by national and local authorities. 

<p>

Having regard for this, there is need for a reconsideration of

the implications of the APSO target of 2,000 personnel overseas

by 1997 as aid must never become supply driven.  There is also

need for formulation by APSO of a coherent strategy on its

support to the education sector which is consistent with Irish

Aid policy in this regard.  

<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 8:</H4>

<p>

     - that all Irish Aid support for education should be based

     on three principles:

<p>

          -    an increase in host countries capacity to plan

               and manage education;

          -    improvement in educational access and equity; and

          -    improvement in the quality of education.

<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 9:</H4>

<p>

     - that APSO develop a strategy on its support to the

     education sector consistent with Irish Aid policy.

<p>

<A NAME="con"><H3>2.6  CONCLUSION</H3></A>

<p>

Taking all of the above points into consideration and bearing in

mind the recommendations emanating from Ms Cathy Gaynor's Report

and the consultative process, an Irish Aid policy on principles

and priorities for Irish Aid involvement in education should now

be developed.  This policy must build on the existing body of

research as well as field experience, consultation and dialogue. 

It must be agreed by all partners and provide a base of

fundamental principles which will issue forth into concrete

action for education and change in the developing world.
