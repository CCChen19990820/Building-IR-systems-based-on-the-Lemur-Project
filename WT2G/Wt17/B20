Finland's and EU's Development Cooperation: A Comparison.<br>

<i>Jarle Harstad and Paul Silfverberg</i><p></h3>

<h5>(Summary of FINNIDA Evaluation Study 1995:2)<br></h5>

</center><p>

<hr>

Upon Finland's entry into the European Union, FINNIDA decided to carry out a comparative analysis of Finland's and the EU's development cooperation policies and modalities. The points of departure were the new obligations and responsibilities as well as the new opportunities which participation in the new European-level international cooperation offered Finland. The study contains:

<ul>

<li>a comparative analysis of Finnish and EU development cooperation policies and processes;<br>

<li>a comparison of the modalities of developing country relations, as well as the concurrence and coherence between and within Finnish and EU relations;<br>

<li>visions for future Finnish participation in policy dialogue and development cooperation issues within the EU.

</ul><p>

After a review of EU and Finnish development policy and programmes, the authors suggest that:

<ul>

<li>Finnish comparative advantages compared to the EU seem to be in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable use of natural resources, and social development (including gender issues).<p>

<li>Finland can benefit from cooperation within the EU in matters such as democratisation, macro-economic policies, institutional development, trade, untying of aid, and the development of private sector institutions.<p>

<li>Finland can activity promote Finnish experience and expertise in countries such as Vietnam, Nepal, and Nicaragua where the EU has been a marginal donor until now.<p>

<li>Finland should continue its efforts to increase recipient responsibility and execution in its programmes. This includes seeking to influence the EU towards establishing real partnerships with recipient countries.<p>

<li>Together with fellow EU members, Finland should assess ways to simplify and streamline EU aid and cooperation procedures, espcially for ACP countries.<p>

<li>Both Finnish and EU aid should gradually shift from an emphasis on attainment of physical targets toward more concern for local competence and institution building.

<h1>Equal is as equal does: Challenging Vatican views on Women</h1>



In preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women, United Nations member states reported on the status of women within their borders. The Vatican, whose Permanent Observer Mission enjoys UN status identical to Switzerland's, offered opinions on women's status globally, remaining mute about any woman living in the Holy See. The WomenChurch Convergence submitted a commentary on the Vatican report to the planning committee for the Beijing conference, of which this is an edited version.<p>




As women from the Roman Catholic tradition, we have a special expertise in analysing and critiquing the language in which the Vatican presents - and sometimes cloaks - its ideas and aims. We have read with concern and consternation the Report of the Holy See in Preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women. We see in the Report an aspect of religious fundamentalism that misuses tradition and anthropology to limit women's roles and functions - indeed, rights. <p>


The Vatican acknowledges that the difference between its "nature" and that of other governments results in a country report that is "different in character from those presented by the other groups taking part in the preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women". <p>


We would add that, in asserting itself as a "state", the Vatican faces numerous challenges in presenting a credible report. First, the governing structure of the Holy See includes no women in policy making and no women in the church's single existing electoral body, the College of Cardinals. There is no requirement that women be consulted regarding the development or content of Vatican documents, including this Report - and no indication that such consultation occurred voluntarily.<p>


Second, we would note that, unlike other country reports, the Vatican makes not even the pretence of including information on the status of women within the church itself - neither women's employment in church agencies, nor their political rights, nor health care options within Catholic hospitals. In all such areas, serious issues of discrimination exist, and Roman Catholic women and men are working to correct these flaws. They do so in the face of substantial resistance from the very church leaders who are responsible for this Report. <p>


Given these flaws, we suggest that the positions taken by the Holy See and the theoretical constructs that inform them should be read with caution - indeed, suspicion - by both governments and non-governmental organizations accredited to the Beijing conference.


<h3>The prime problem: patriarchal anthropology</h3>

The Vatican's document calls for the promotion of women's dignity. However, implicit throughout the Report is the fundamental flaw that plagues all hierarchical Catholic teaching about women, namely, an anthropology which presumes that men are the human norm and women are "different".<p>


The Vatican constructs a vision of women and men in which men are normative persons and women are primarily understood in terms of their reproductive and mothering capacities. The most serious implications of this outmoded anthropology are apparent in the terms, definitions, and proposals that are built on its inaccurate premises. For example, the laudable ideal of women's dignity is circumscribed by the assumption that women's dignity is somehow based in reproductive capacity. No such assumption is made, ever, with regard to men, whose dignity is presumed simply to be conferred by their humanity. <p>


Moreover, the roles of women in family life, in the work place, and in politics are all limited and understood in relation to this anthropology. Nothing accrues to women simply because they are human. Now that women have increasing control over their reproductive lives, and now that men are understood to share equally the joys and burdens of rearing the next generation, there is simply no justification for such outdated notions unless the intent is to discriminate. We challenge the Vatican to reconstruct this anthropological foundation if it wishes to be taken seriously when it claims to have women's well-being in mind. 

<h3>A corollary problem: hostility to feminism</h3>

Another aspect of patriarchal anthropology is seen in the Report's deep hostility to all that modern feminism has contributed to the advancement of new concepts of women's nature and roles in society. Feminists are implicitly divided into the good and the bad-the latter being "radical feminists." Radical feminists are caricatured as having sought, in the bad old 1960s and 1970s, a "complete uniformity or an undifferentiated levelling of the two sexes," which is now rejected. "Radical 'feminism'," according to the Vatican, denied women the "right to be a woman". Equally, there is the now classic attempt to divide women, North from South. Women in the industrial world, the Vatican claims, have adopted "approaches to the advancement of women" that ignore the poverty of women in the South and are part and parcel of "hedonistic and individualistic culture".<p>


Nowhere in the Report is there any recognition of what women have done worldwide to improve their own lives and those of their communities. Nowhere is there a recognition that it is women - and feminists - who have articulated and struggled for measures that have improved the lives of women in the North and the South alike. Nor does the Report notice that women have been the backbone and sometimes the leaders of broad-based movements for peace and justice worldwide - from Ireland to Argentina, from the Philippines to the United States.


<h3>Equality admits no exceptions</h3>

In its Report, the Vatican pays lip service to women's equality but, in every instance, adds qualifiers that indicate that it is an equality predicated on difference, which is finally not equality. In fact, the "specificity of women" no more needs safeguarding than the specificity of men, if both are taken as normatively human. We who know the Vatican's mind-set best respectfully point it out to those who might be moved by the rhetoric and not the reality of the Vatican's theological politics.<p>


Equal is as equal does. The Vatican's record of response to women's "specificity" is dismal at best. It is the Vatican's view of women's specificity that has led to prohibitions on women's reproductive choices and sexual expression, and to the banning of women as priests and bishops. It is this kind of thinking - that some are more fully human than others - that underlies the hierarchical structures of the Catholic church, structures that exclude and demean women.


<h3>Women are more than their reproductive capacities</h3>

Our primary concern follows on the Vatican's actions in Cairo last year, at the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development. Note that, throughout the Vatican Report for Beijing, women's reproductive capacity is emphasized. This strikes us as anachronistic at a time in history when so many other things could merit priority: women's unprecedented levels of education and employment throughout the world, women's political work, women's contributions to the arts, and indeed, women's theological contributions, which have increased geometrically in a generation. <p>


All of these and many more aspects of women are left aside in favour of the old, tried and untrue statements about the implications of women's reproductive capacity. Even in those instances where women are idealized, like Mary, there is the old fall-back to stereotypic notions of women as, fundamentally, wives and mothers. What is clear and true is that not all women are mothers, and those who are, are not simply mothers. It is hard to imagine - and it certainly is never stated - that the Vatican has in mind a similar notion of men as husbands and fathers. In this pernicious form, complementarity is not reciprocal. The far-reaching damages of this mistaken idea about women are such that the idea must be eradicated.


<h3>Women's 'vulnerability' is men's violence</h3>

Perhaps the most perplexing part of the Vatican's analysis is its notion that the "life of women remains more uncertain and more vulnerable than that of men". No analysis follows that would suggest what is missing from the equation, namely, that the uncertainty or vulnerability that many women experience is neither biological nor essential. In fact, it is created by a patriarchal society in which men are taught that women are "special" - read, inferior - and that men, as normative human beings, can treat women as they will. The Vatican conveniently leaves out this "absent referent", men. The statement would be more accurate if it said, "Many men treat women with such disdain that women are vulnerable and subject to violence in a patriarchal society." This acknowledgement - along with a condemnation of the fact - would be welcome, but it is missing.<p>


Such an acknowledgement would seem to come most hard to those in the Vatican, who, lacking the very family life that they extol, instead have romantic visions of family life. Not surprisingly, they fail to account for the well documented fact that - against women's will and desire - the family is the site of most violence against women, that is, of the "hazard and ... handicap" which the Vatican ridicules as feminist cant.<p>


There is another lacuna in what the Report does say about violence and families. Families are said to suffer violence "through the imposition from outside of various programmes which particularly concern the obligatory control of the number of births, forced sterilization and the encouragement of abortion". This strikes us as remarkable and pernicious when promulgated by the very ecclesiastical institution that has been responsible for preventing access to sexuality education, contraceptives, and safe, affordable, accessible, and legal abortions. On this point, the Vatican doth protest too much. Indeed, if the Vatican had its way, the "gift of life" it exalts would be coerced through forced continuation of pregnancies that are unsupported and unsupportable. 


<h3>A new vision of Catholic social justice</h3>

Given these concerns, it is clear that economic policies, educational programmes, and political strategies for women which emerge from the Vatican are deeply suspect. As women from the Roman Catholic tradition, we respectfully suggest a new vision of social justice, one that emerges from our feminist understanding of the church - and other communities -as properly consisting of a "discipleship of equals"; that is, our vision begins with the radical equality of creation: women, men, children, and the earth. Justice for women, as for men, is predicated on equality in deed as well as in word. To that end, we offer the following sketch of a social justice vision for the coming century. <ul>

<b>*</b>A feminist anthropology rests on the radical equality of women and men in community. Both women and men are expected to contribute to the work, education, culture, and moral and reproductive tasks of bringing forth successive generations. <p>


<b>*</b>The radical equality of women and men means just what it says. The diversity of creation, including different genders, races, and life styles, implies that there will be great differences among us. The task of a "discipleship of equals" is to hold all of this difference in common, encouraging it and making the world a welcoming place for it.<p>


<b>*</b>Women are multifaceted, just as men are. Women's contributions to the political world and in the home, in the work place sports, culture, and religion are to be taken seriously and valued. Reproduction is important, but it is only one of the functions that women and men share; because women have been discriminated against in this arena, we give special priority to women's reproductive health needs, whose fulfilment has been shown to promote the well-being of children and the development of countries. <p>


<b>*</b>Community, rather than family, is our programmatic focus. For example, as members of the human community, we all require health care; this need is not subsidiary to family roles and relationships which nevertheless often structure, and limit, the availability of health care through insurance. Likewise, in education and work, we favour programmes that leave aside the relational constellations in which people find themselves, and instead look to the tremendous needs, material and spiritual, which remain to be fulfilled. <p>


<b>*S</b>afety is a human right. We strive to dismantle hierarchical structures and to end discrimination because they can result in insult and injury. We encourage change in attitudes, behaviours, and laws to secure our common well-being. Our reverence for the earth, as well as for all of its peoples, requires such vigilance. </ul><p>

Less attention was given to the fundamental shift in the nature of Mexico's political system produced by an alliance of NGOs. Report by <b>David C. Scott, </b>former Mexico correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor. </i><hr>The 1994 elections in Mexico will probably be viewed as a milestone in the development of NGOs south of the border. Under the coordination of Civic Alliance, Mexican non-governmental organizations banded together on a scale never seen before. Some 400 human rights and social groups marshalled 20,000 volunteers to scrutinize the votes and carry out a series of crucial checks on the election process. Their efforts stimulated a civic ground swell that brought out another 60,000 observers belonging to labour unions, business organizations and youth groups. <p>In contrast to the elections in South Africa, Cambodia and El Salvador (to name some random examples), the United Nations provided only technical assistance in Mexico. Reluctance on both sides of the fence kept the UN role marginal. Instead, Civic Alliance took the lead.<p>In the months leading up to the elections, the Alliance worked with human rights groups from several states to monitor media coverage of the campaigns to detect bias. Regular reports spotlighted the huge bias toward the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (RPI) in the media and had a mitigating effect. <p>On election night, a "quick count" was made by Alliance members reporting in from around the nation, producing an early gauge by which to judge official results. In 1988, the computers tallying the officials results mysteriously "crashed" when early returns showed the opposition party in the lead and final results took weeks to appear.<p>"In 1988 we had no information. This time we had the data, putting pressure on the government institutions to perform," says Sergio Aguayo, director of Civic Alliance and the Mexican Academy for Human Rights. "Society generating its own data is part of the process of democratization of information." The elections gave many of these small, isolated groups their first taste of technology - fax machines, computers, modems - now familiar to urban organizations. The technology was used not only to send in voter tallies but rapidly transmit reports of fraud, intimidation and other irregularities in the election on a timely basis.<p>But Aguayo sees another, more significant benefit for those who participated in the alliance. "We're seeing a profound effect on their self-esteem. They've proven to themselves that they can coordinate and do difficult tasks which have significant political implications."<p>The Civic Alliance model grew out of a voter education and poll-watching effort in the 1991 Governor's election in San Luis Potosi. Aguayo's Mexican Academy of Human Rights brought his technical and political savvy to a partnership with a local NGO, the San Luis Potosi Civic Front. For the first time in Mexico, an organization unaffiliated with any political party provided proof of fraud during the elections. The evidence was a catalyst for huge protest marches.<p>With an authoritarian government, the drive for political rights and human rights goes hand in hand, says Mariclaire Acosta, director of the Mexican Commission for the Defence and Promotion of Human Rights, which participated in the Alliance. "We won't have respect for human rights until we have accountability. And the only way to get accountability is if the political process works." <p>Polls by Este Pa!s magazine editor Federico Reyes Heroles show that 67 percent of the Mexican population doesn't have faith in the judicial system. Only 20 percent believe in their government institutions. But NGOs, increasingly effective and visible in recent years, garner an 80% credibility rating. <p>The government's abysmal credibility is a "very dangerous situation," says Acosta. "To restore credibility to government institutions you have to build from below. That's what we're doing."<p>The Alliance is a democratizing process for the NGOs, too. As in many developing countries, Mexican NGOs often have more contact with foreign counterparts than their domestic colleagues. <p>Through the Alliance, observes Acosta, "we're learning now how to discuss and tolerate our differences, to achieve a shared goal. That's part of the democratic process. The networking also gives us a better capacity to mobilize when we need to in the future." <p>For example, on 23 September the Alliance is pooling the efforts of several groups in Mexico City to hold an unofficial plebiscite on the installation of parking meters in a neighbourhood which claims officials are ignoring their objections to the plan. The Mexican elections attracted nearly 1,000 registered foreign observers. Many coordinated their efforts with the Alliance. Their presence is likely to have a pay-off in terms of increased attention and funding, too.<p>For example, a Canadian group witnessed the persecution and arrest of a Jesuit priest for trying to get the vote out. Members of a North American lawyers' group saw the police teargas a group of campesinos protesting election fraud. "They helped the campesinos escape. This creates solidarity. Injustice now has a name and a face for these visitors," says Acosta.<p>"The elections have been a catalyst for Mexico's citizen movement, which seems to be gaining momentum month by month," says Katherine Kilbourn of Grassroots International, a Washington DC-based NGO which funds coffee farmers in Oaxaca. "The movement has been pushed along by the economic and political situation which in turn is pulling the economic and political system forward. It's exciting." <p>In Mexican literature and history, the Spanish word aguantar is continually used to define the Mexican character. It means "bear up", "endure", or "submit". While in the rest of Latin America poverty has produced revolt and civil war, Mexico's downtrodden have submitted.<p>How does that jibe with Mexico's awakening civic movement? <p>"Mexicans submit not because they are passive but because they are wise," says Acosta. "Until now they've never had a viable democratic alternative. But given an alternative, they will move." <p><hr><h3>MEXICAN CONTACTS</h3><p>Academia Mexicana de Derechos Humanos,<br>Filosofia y Letras 88,<br>Coplico Universidad,<br>Mexico, D.F. 04380.<br>Tel:52(5)-659-87-84, 659-49-80.<br>Fax:52(5)-658-72-79.<p>Acuerdo Nacional para la Democracia (ACUDE),<br>Manuel M.

DANIDA Evaluation Unit

<p>

</h3>

</center><p>

<hr>

<p>

The responsibility of Danida's Evaluation Unit is to assist in maintaining and improving the quality of Danish aid.

 



<P>An evaluation is an examination, as systematic and objective as possible, of the design,


implementation and results of an ongoing or completed project or programme, with the


aim of determining its efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and the relevance of


its objectives.





<P>Danida evaluations primarily serve as management tools with a view to improve the


projects evaluated and, being a systematic way of learning from experience, to provide


lessons which can guide future decisions and thus improve Danish development assistance.


Furthermore, evaluation together with monitoring activities provide information to Danida


and host country managers about the performance of projects and programmes.






<P>Another important purpose of evaluation is to provide accountability about the aid process


to the political community and to serve as a basis for informing the public about the


results of Danish development assistance.






<P>Evaluations are carried out by interdisciplinary teams, mostly composed of external


consultants. This is primarily due to the desirability of a high degree of independence in


the evaluation work. Furthermore Danida aims at establishing cooperation  between the


authorities and local consultants of the recipient country and the evaluation teams. This is


done partly in order to strengthen the capacity of the recipient country, partly in order to


get the benefit of these consultants' knowledge of the local conditions.








<P>A list of reports issued since late 1991 and a 4 page summary of each are available on the <A HREF="http://www.ingenioeren.dk/danaida/danida.html"  target="_top"> Internet</a> (http://www.ingenioeren.dk/danida/danida.html). A few 

reports and summaries however are not available on the World Wide Web. Some  

illustrations and enclosures are not available either. We refer to the printed editions, which

<li><b>Political deaths:</b> In Tibet there have been 13 deaths in or shortly after custody since 1990 <font size=-1>4 </font><p>

<li><b> Detentions:</b> There are 732 known political prisoners in Tibet<font size=-1> 4</font>
<br clear=left><p>

<br>

<li><b>Slave labour: </b>An estimated 16-20 million prisoners are held in 4,000-6,000 loagai or 'labour reform camps' in China and Tibet. Slave labour from these camps earns China several hundred million dollars.<font size=-1>6</font><br clear=left><p>


<br>
<li><b>Birth control: </b>Coercion is an integral part of Chinese family-planning policies, and there are reports of forced sterilizations and abortions. Fines can be as high as 10 to 15 times the average rural income. Rules for Chinese are even stricter. <font size=-1>7</font><br clear=left><p>

<br>
<li><b>Chinese rule:</b> According to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, 1.2 million Tibetans died between 1949 and 1979 of causes related to the Chinese occupation - during combat, by execution, through torture, through starvation and by suicide. <font size=-1>12</font><br clear=left><p>

<h3>Give and Take</h3>



<b>China claims to be pumping huge sums of development money into Tibet. How much it is taking out in terms of natural resources is not disclosed.</b><p>


<b>IN: </b>China spends $270 million per year on 'development' in Tibet.<font size=-1>2</font><br>
<b>OUT: </b>Half of Tibet's forests have been felled since 1959 - providing the Chinese with $50 billion worth of timber.7 
More than a quarter of Tibet's mineral resources have been extracted since 1959.<font size=-1>8</font><p>


<li> China is short of natural resources. Within the next decade 7 of the 15 key staple minerals essential to its economy will run out. In Tibet 126 types of minerals, with major deposits of uranium, lithium, bauxite, borax, chromite, copper, gold, iron, and silver have been identified by the Chinese.<font size=-1>9</font><p>


<b>China's plans for Tibet:</b><br>
<li> To achieve economic growth at 10% per year until 2000.<br>
<li> To industrialize agriculture and boost grain production to one million tons per year.<br>
<li> To build a US 2.6 billion Tibet-China rail link, to aid migration and transport resources.  <br>
<li> To encourage foreign investment.<font size=-1>8</font><p>

<hr width=71%><p>



<h3>Discrimination</h3>



<b>Chinese migrants have far greater access to education and jobs than ethnic Tibetans.</b><p>

<br><br><br>


<li>Tibetans and Chinese are segregated at school. Chinese classes get better teachers and facilities.<font size=-1>7</font><p>

<li> 45% of Tibetans aged 15 and over are illiterate or semi-literate, three times the average Chinese rate of 15%.<font size=-1>7 </font><p><br clear=all>

<br><br><br>


<li> Tibetans still far outnumber Chinese in the TAR area of Tibet. Yet the Chinese dominate the key areas of employment.<p><br clear=all>



<br><br><br>

<li> According to official statistics the children of Chinese migrants make up only 3.7 per cent of the child population. But Chinese is the dominant language in secondary education and Chinese children get much further than Tibetans.<br clear=all>

<h3>Survival</h3>



<b>China's communist rule brought science and modern medicine to Tibet. But after 45 years of occupation, the basic health and survival needs of Tibetans are far from being met.</b><p>

<br><br><br>

<b>Health and wealth</b><p>

<li>To be admitted into hospital as an in-patient a deposit of $60 has to be paid. This is almost as much as a Tibetan rural worker can hope to earn in a year.<font size=-1>7 </font><br clear=all><p>

Development Programme(CSPD) </CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
UNICEF's cooperation with the government of Tanzania started in 1954 with
a shipment of milk powder. 40 years later UNICEF and the government of Tanzania
are partners in a comprehensive, multi-million dollar effort to improve
the lives of women and children.<BR>
<BR>
Tanzania is renowned for the culture of self-reliance which was initiated
by its first president, Nyerere, who was in office for 24 years. The population
of Tanzania is still predominantly based in rural areas, and still largely
reliant on subsistence farming for day to day survival.  <BR>
<BR>
From 1970 President Nyerere established  a programme of villagisation, which
encouraged subsistence farmers in remote parts of the country to resettle
in population clusters where they could be more easily reached with social
services. Although unpopular at the time it  certainly helped the development
of Tanzania's extensive social services programme. <BR>
<BR>
Following villagisation, in the late 1970s UNICEF's new Basic Services Strategy
supported efforts to: provide improved water schemes to more than half the
country's villages; construct thousands of primary schools and health centres,
and train teachers and healthworkers. Sadly, life for many Tanzanians is
probably worse now than it was 20 years ago. As in so many countries, repayment
of the national debt and introduction of economic austerity measures is
restricting funds available for health and education, which has meant that
these services are inadequate and deteriorating.<BR>
<BR>
Nyerere retired in 1985 and was followed by President Mwinyi (facing elections
in October '95) but much of the administrative structure remains the same.<BR>
Tanzania has a pyramid administrative structure (see diagram below). A similar
structure has been developed in Zanzibar. This facilitates delivery of the
CSPD programme. <BR>
The CSPD programme began in the mid-1980s. It is now active in 12 out of
the 20 mainland Regions as well as Zanzibar, reaching almost half the population.
The programmes in two of  Mwanza Region's six districts, and Zanzibar, where
we visited, are completely supported by UNICEF, largely through donations
from the UK Committee. UNICEF supports the CSPD programme in 50 of the 104
Districts. Other donors to UNICEF include the government ministries of:
Sweden (SIDA), Norway (Norad) and the Netherlands.<BR>
<BR>
A major part of the CSPD programme is the establishment of systems for planning,
delivering and monitoring services at community level. Each village selects
two village health workers - a man and a woman. Every village has a village
government structure of elected members, supported by a government representative
who will live in the village but not originate from the village. This person
feeds village decisions into Ward level meetings. The selected health workers
are crucial to the success of the CSPD programme. They need to be stable
members of the village, reliable and trustworthy with a primary level education.
They receive two months training. One of them may already be a traditional
birth attendant.<BR>
<BR>
The village government sets up four committees: health, water and sanitation,
finance and village safety and security, which are overseen by the village
leaders. (See the data for Kashishi Village, page 14, for example of the
decisions made by village government.)<BR>
<BR>
The two health workers keep registers of all families/householders, children
and their health records. Education extension staff from the Ward level
oversee pre-school and primary education. Every village has at least one
primary school and a school committee of parents and teachers. Secondary
schools are at District level and children often have to board.<BR>
<H3>CSPD in Mwanza Region</H3>
<BR>
Mwanza Region - population<BR>
<BR>
Region 	- population 	1.7 million<BR>
District 	- population 	2-300,000<BR>
Division 	- population 	50-70,000<BR>
Ward 	- population 	10-15,000<BR>
Village 	- population 	2-3,000<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The CSPD programmes in Geita and Sengerema, two Districts with high population
density, started in June 1992.<BR>
<BR>
First the programme was discussed with Regional authorities, who are government
officials, and District Councils, who were enthusiastic about the prospect
of this integrated approach to community development. The first year was
spent mobilising local leaders and communities so that they would understand
their responsibilities within the programme, and that of the supporting
agencies like UNICEF and non-governmental organisations working in the Region.<BR>
<BR>
With acceptance of the programme came 'capacity building', i.e. training,
research, putting equipment and supplies in place. UNICEF provided the following
to Geita District which has 76 villages:
<BLOCKQUOTE>155 bicycles - for village health workers<BR>
12 motorcycles - for 13 Ward offices<BR>
2 motor vehicles (Toyota Landcruiser and Hilux) - at Regional and District
level<BR>
56 weighing scales (hanging)<BR>
62 weighing scales (standing)<BR>
78 file folders<BR>
196 registers for recording information<BR>
20, 679 growth monitoring cards<BR>
41 birth attendant kits<BR>
147 Village health workers kits <BR>
147 drug kits </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Every village has a village health day once a month when mothers come to
the health centre with their young children for weighing and vaccination
in a systematic growth monitoring programme. UNICEF provides regular supplies
of vaccine which are kept cold in UNICEF supplied kerosene fuelled refrigerators
- the government supplies the kerosene. The vaccination programme is a national
programme and takes place throughout the country.<BR>
<H3>The Child Survival, Protection and Development Programme is divided
into six main areas:</H3>
<BR>
<B>Community mobilisation</B>, participation and management involves raising
awareness of health, nutrition, education and community development issues
in the village. It helps communities to assess the situation, analyse the
causes of the problems and take action for solutions - a process known as
the Triple A approach  to problem solving.  Communities gather information
on their social problems such as child malnutrition and manage their initiatives.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Adequacy of food intake</B> is a concept used to describe efforts to
ensure that women and children get enough of the right kind of food, which
entails improving feeding practices and the availability of food.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Child development and education</B> aims to improve the quality of early
child care and basic education through greater community involvement in
the management of day-care centres and primary education. It supports training
for teachers, childcare centre attendants and members of village and school
committees.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Health, water and sanitation</B> rest on the principle that clean water
and good health are inseparable. The CSPD programme provides support for
communities to improve and manage health and water and sanitation systems
themselves.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Income-generating activities</B> are designed to alleviate poverty, one
of the most basic causes of malnutrition. Assistance is provided, especially
to women, to increase their income and their control over it. Income-generating
schemes provide credit, training and technical assistance.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Children's and women's rights and protection</B> are promoted through
advocacy using the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The main
focus is on children at risk, the special needs of girl children, street
children, AIDS orphans and women's rights.  <BR>

<h2>Letter from Amnesty International to the NGO Forum on Women 1 September 1995</h2>


<h3>Members of the Facilitating Committee<br>
NGO Forum on Women</h3>

<font size=+1>Dear Members,</font><p>


The NGO Forum at this World Conference on Women provides an historic opportunity for women from around the world to join together to achieve the goal of the conference -- Equality by the Year 2000.<p>


The hopes and expectations of the activists at this conference are especially high since this is the first world conference on women in a decade, and as such offers a chance to dramatically change the situation of women as we enter the next century. <p>


The debates and activities organized by the women's groups themselves will stimulate an important debate around the crucial issues facing women today. The caucus discussions around the Platform of Action will hopefully lead to a strong and clear demand from the Forum to the official conference on the action that is needed to improve the lives of women internationally. <p>


As we enter the third day of the NGO Forum, however, there are still serious questions being raised and problems encountered by those attending the Forum. Until those questions are put to rest and the problems resolved, I fear that the real issues at the Forum will not get the attention they rightly deserve.<p>


The first issue is the unhealthy atmosphere created at the Forum by the heavy security presence.<p>


Conflicting messages continue to be sent to the organizations at the Forum: we have been told alternately that demonstrations are allowed only in the schoolyard in Huairou, that demonstrations are allowed anywhere in the Forum compound, and that regardless of where demonstrations are held they won't be allowed if they are deemed by the authorities to be "anti-China".<p>


Other examples that Amnesty International and other delegates to the Forum have experienced include: workshops being monitored by security officials who take notes and photographs of participants and have attempted to confiscate workshop materials. These conditions at the Forum have been accompanied by some delegates being followed by security officials within the forum compound, and heavy and constant security presence and surveillance in hotels, which extends to participants not being allowed to receive guests. <p>


This presence is often described as necessary to ensure the safety of participants at the Forum; however, the effect is not to create a sense of security but to instill a deep feeling of insecurity among Forum delegates. Our fear is that these intimidating tactics will not allow participants to exchange views freely and debate fully the issues that have brought them to this conference from around the world. And we have to ask - is this extreme level of security really necessary for a conference that can in no way threaten the security of the state. <p>


The second issue is of access to the Forum. While we understand that it is not the role of the NGO Forum organizers to grant visas to participants, it is still astonishing that only 26,000 visas were apparently granted out of some 36,000 applicants. In the past few days leading up to the start of the Forum, we have heard many stories of participants being frustrated in their attempts to get visas and others simply not receiving them. <p>


It is our view that the NGO Forum should seek and obtain from the Chinese authorities detailed explanations regarding those participants who were denied the right to participate in this world gathering. It is indeed regrettable that those women at the grassroots who have been at the forefront of all the advances achieved in the fields covered by this Forum have been denied the opportunity to share experiences with their sisters. <p>


And finally, the issue of facilities, organization, and access to information through independent newspapers. For two days running, a significant number of Forum participants have been excluded from joining in key events because of inadequate facilities. First the opening ceremony and then the opening plenary session. Participants have told us about rooms that are too small and equipment that is faulty or inadequate. And facilities and access for people with disabilities are wholly inadequate.<p>


I am setting down these concerns at the start of the Forum in the hope that you will be able to address them quickly. Until they are solved, we fear that the crucial issues that must be debated by the women at this Forum will be overshadowed by anger, apprehension and confusion. <p>


In yesterday's issue of Forum 95 you were quoted as saying that "protesters are free to use any area in the forum site as the rules of the United Nations demands, and we will go by that". As well you offered assurances that freedom of expression will be guaranteed and that clarification of this issue has been obtained from the Chinese government. <p>


I would urge you to do everything within your power to ensure that the opportunity for real freedom of expression prevails at the Forum to ensure the vital contribution of everyone at this conference.<p>


Sincerely,<p>


Pierre Sane<br>
Secretary General<p>

Many of today's serious international problems -- ethnic conflicts, failing states, and the resultant humanitarian disasters -- could potentially be averted or ameliorated with effective early attention. <p>Yet, despite the considerable attention given to conflict prevention, there has still been little clinical scrutiny of the concept or practise. The CPA is an effort to fill those voids of understanding and action.  <p>The CPA has four main functions:<p><ol><li>To convene an annual conference -- the first was held in New York on 16 December 1994 -- to assess the state of the art. The conference brings together practioners from governments, international organizations, and NGOs with scholars, representatives of foundations, Congress and journalists to assess what they have learned in the previous year.<p><li>To serve as a coordinating centre, letting everyone involved in conflict prevention know what everyone else is doing.<p><li>To serve as a repository for relevant books, articles, and other documents. Such a centralized research centre does not currently exist.<p><li>To test systematically the viability of conflict prevention by sending investigative teams to pre-explosion crisis areas to map out how to settle or manage conflicts and then to advocate action by appropriate governments and organizations, national and international, private and public.</ol><p>For further information contact: Barnett R.

<p>



<h3>The growth of towns and urban poverty in the Third World</h3>



According to projections by the United Nations, 51% of the world's population will live in towns and cities

in the year 2000 and as many as 65% in the year 2025. The total population of the world will be 8.4 billion

in the year 2000, 4.4 billion of whom will live in the towns of developing countries. Primary and medium-

sized towns in developing countries will grow explosively, especially in Asia and Africa. Because of their

unbalanced demographic structure - large numbers of young migrants and a high excess of births over deaths

- the population in towns and cities will continue to grow faster than in rural areas for a long time, even if

migration to towns declines. 

<p>

A growing percentage of the urban population of Latin America, and of Africa and Asia, live below the

poverty line. Between 1970 and 1980, the population of greater Sao Paulo rose by 44%, but that of the

working-class districts went up by 446% in the same period. More than a third of urban residents in Asia

(1985) live below the poverty line and the figure is as high as 86% in Bangladesh. Even in the rapidly

expanding economies of South and East Asia more than 10% of the urban population live below the poverty

line. 

<p>

Absolute poverty in the world, measured in terms of income, is still worst in rural areas. According to

statistics the level of provisions and facilities is higher in urban than in rural areas. However, a growing

number of the urban poor are affected by a concentration of inter-related poverty factors. According to their

own perception of their circumstances the urban poor see "vulnerability" as the main feature of their

existence. They often have no access to provisions such as education, health care, proper housing and credit

and other facilities for work and income. In most Third World towns and cities a large percentage of the

workforce is unemployed or working in temporary jobs. The growth of the workforce - the population

between 15 and 65 years of age - is usually faster in towns than that of the urban population as a whole.

The demand for labour by the government authorities and large and medium-sized business declined sharply

in the eighties in a number of developing countries. The fall in real wages in the public sector and major

private sector companies and the large numbers of unemployed have also caused incomes to drop in the

informal sector. The levels of protection for employees have fallen dramatically.

<p>

The urban poor do not have social networks, nor do they have any influence on political decision-making

processes or say about the circumstances in which they live. The urban authorities do not usually have the

management capacity or the resources to deal with the complex problems effectively. Nevertheless, many of

the urban poor actually succeed in raising their standard of living. In a number of towns, the residents of

slum areas have successfully formed self-help organisations, often for highly specific purposes such as

housing and water. The appalling living conditions of poor people in towns also create psychological and

social problems in the form of stress, alienation, instability and insecurity, heightened by the disappointment

of expectations which have failed to materialise and the discrepancy between incomes and spending

opportunities in towns. This situation often leads to social unrest, forms of violence and crime in which

young people are both victims and offenders, child abuse and violence against women in the home.

<p>

<h3>The most affected groups</h3>



The vicious circle of marginalisation in towns is worst for three groups of poor people:

<ul>

<li>Mothers, especially breadwinners who are heads of poor households i.e. women-maintained

households. The repercussions of a poor diet, bad health, living conditions in slums, and long hours at work

and travelling to and from the workplace are worst for pregnant women with jobs.

<li>Street children. Children and young people up to the age of 24 represent 55.8% of the total population

of developing countries and 65% in Africa (1992). The low family incomes of the poor, their limited access

to work and the disintegration of the family mean more children end up on the streets. Estimates suggest the

world total amounts to tens of millions. The most vulnerable are once again girls aged between 12 and 16

and pre-teenagers. Street children are left to fend for themselves and many end up in crime and prostitution.

They are abused by the drugs mafia and in Latin America they are exposed to violence by the police and

death squads.

<li>Unemployed young people. Unemployment is especially high among young people up to the age of

25. They have little access to the informal sector and small companies. The young also have to compete

with older people who have lost their jobs in the formal sector.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Existing policy to fight urban poverty</h3>



The Council's report examines the policies of a large number of players who are attempting to fight urban

poverty. The Council notes that the policy priorities of developing countries, multilateral donors and the

Netherlands Minister for Development Cooperation do not always coincide. The authorities of developing

countries only approach the problem of the urban poor as a separate issue as an exception. Even an

organisation like the World Bank places its efforts to reduce urban poverty in the context of general urban

development. The priorities of Netherlands policy such as work and incomes, the human settlements sector

and improving public administration are no different from those of the  multilateral organisations, although

the strong emphasis of current policy on direct measures to fight urban poverty is an exception.

<p> 

To summarise, the Council has the following comments about Netherlands development policy:

<ul>

<li>Development policy to fight urban poverty is formulated as a flanking policy, not only in relation to

the policy of virtually all the relevant multilateral organisations, but also in relation to the policy of most

developing countries.

<li>Policy as a whole does not focus explicitly on problems of unemployment among young people and

their lack of training, the position of women in towns and the problem of urban environment, nor on special

opportunities for Netherlands policy to solve problems in secondary towns. Publications do not suggest that

the Women and Environment Spearhead Programmes have integrated urban aspects into their activities. In

the view of the Council this means that an important area of policy - unemployment among young people -

is not receiving attention.

<li>The Council endorses the importance of programmes by the Netherlands Finance Company for

Developing Countries (FMO) and the Retired Managers Assignment Programme (PUM) to generate

employment in developing countries.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Basic premises</h3>



The Council's most important conclusion is that a special policy needs to be formulated in view of the

nature and rapidly growing urgency of urban poverty. The Council's basic premise is that policy to reduce

urban poverty is an integral part of Netherlands development policy as a whole. 

<p>

The Council considers that Netherlands bilateral aid to fight urban poverty should be confined to cities

which have no more than one to two million inhabitants, if only because the Netherlands can not call on the

expertise required to administer very large cities. In view of the structural nature of the problem, the choice

of towns will involve long-term cooperation with "concentration towns". The Council also thinks that the

three most important target groups for Netherlands policy which is designed to fight urban poverty should

be women-maintained households, unemployed young people and street children.

<p>

Formulation of Netherlands policy in this area should be based on a broad and integrated vision and a

process approach. In view of the inter-related nature of the problems, attempts to solve urban poverty will

require simultaneous policy interventions at various administrative levels and of different kinds: human

resource development to raise productivity, improvements in administration and management, macro-

economic policy, creating facilities, promoting the participation of the urban poor and helping them to form

their own organisations, investing in economic activities and infrastructure, combined with improving the

urban environment.  

<p>

The Council attaches great importance to stimulating economic growth as a necessary, though not in itself

sufficient precondition to fight poverty in general and urban poverty in particular. It believes productivity

must be raised in many developing countries, despite the apparent contradiction between this objective and

the possibility of unemployment as a result of short-term and long-term increases in productivity. 

<p>

The Council considers that Netherlands policy to fight urban poverty must make allowance for the extent to

which national development policies of governments of recipient countries allow for the effects of such

policies on the urban poor. Using this criterion, Netherlands policy can make choices to flank or support the

policy of governments or multilateral organisations, and to support certain types of activities such as those

of local NGOs. The Council considers that in countries where national governments do not pursue a

redistribution policy, NGOs should be supported which are trying to help the poor, with the aim of

persuading governments to revise their policies.

<p>



<h3>Policy recommendations</h3>



The Council recommends intensifying the Spearhead Programme for Fighting Urban Poverty in order to

achieve the integrated approach which it advises in its recommendations. 

<p>

If possible the Council recommends that towns should be chosen using an urban poverty index.

<p>

The Council makes a distinction between direct and indirect forms of fight ing urban poverty. Direct

measures to fight poverty means activities which are undertaken in cooperation with or on the initiative of

target groups. Indirect measures to fight poverty include activities designed to improve situations which

partly determine the lives of the target groups, over which they have no say or influence.

<p>



<h4>Direct measures to fight poverty</h4>



The Council recommends promoting direct measures to fight poverty in towns by continuing to provide

NGOs with direct or indirect assistance to encourage the poor to form their own organisations and to take

care of street children. It makes good sense to carry out policy to help unemployed young people in

cooperation with the Netherlands joint financing organisations (MFOs), both sides of Netherlands industry -

unions and employers' organisations - and SNV, all of whom are already involved in such activities. The

Council recommends examining where these organisations can see opportunities to contribute towards the

training of young people and the level to which the local private sector can be involved in such activities.

<p>

The Council recommends that the Netherlands should contribute to the creation of temporary safety net

constructions of the kind used in Bolivia and Jamaica. Steps must be taken to ensure that a Social Develop-

ment Fund meets the conditions which are necessary to ensure that the available funds benefit the target

groups in particular. Although people who depend on wages in a number of countries are among the

vulnerable groups when they become unemployed, in the Council's view they do not occupy an exceptional

position in this respect.

<p>

The Council recommends that the policy dialogue with developing countries on the problems of the urban

poor should take the following considerations into account in relation to the living conditions in working-

class and slum areas:

<ul>

<li>increasing the feasibility and sustainability of activities by involving the population in planning and

implementation;

<li>providing housing rights and land rights and improving the urban infrastructure by making safe

drinking water and sanitation available and refuse collection facilities;

<li>creating opportunities for self-help activities connected with agriculture - such as crops and small

livestock - or making such activities legal in working-class districts;

<li>providing advisory services which will help to persuade small and medium-sized companies in

working-class districts to implement process improvements which will result in less industrial waste and

improve working conditions, especially those of the target groups in such companies; and

<li>improving the quality of the services provided by the urban authorities. 

</ul>

<p>

<h4>Indirect measures to fight poverty</h4>



The Council recommends supporting the policy of the World Bank and the IMF to improve the economic

structure and macro-economic policy in recipient countries. Allowance should be made for the consequences

of this policy for the urban poor. On the basis of an analysis of the effects, flanking activities can be

undertaken, through bilateral channels  if necessary, especially in concentration towns.

<p>

The Council considers that cooperation between UNCHS, UNDP and the World Bank in the Urban

Management Programme merits further support and recommends examining how far it is possible to make

allowance  at the implementation stage for the choice of towns by the Netherlands and the deployment of

Netherlands expertise in this field. In connection with the shortage of resources of the urban authorities the

Council recommends investigating how far the Netherlands can become involved in the World Bank's

Urban Development Loans, especially the parts which relate to improving the urban infrastructure.

<p>

The Council recommends examining the conditions under which Netherlands companies would be willing to

invest in economic activities in concentration towns selected by the Netherlands. In the Council's view, the

demand for products of small businesses is largely determined by the incomes of people who work for large

and medium-sized companies and for government authorities.

<p>

The Council recommends investigating whether opportunities can be created through bilateral or multilateral

channels to stimulate credits for housing by means of local currency loans. It is still important to continue

existing policy in order to support initiatives in the field of credit unions, often through NGOs.

<p>



<h3>Research</h3>



The Minister also asked the Council to examine the need for research to increase the effectiveness of policy

to fight urban poverty. The Council has identified thirteen areas in which  research can fill existing

information gaps. The Council believes that it is important to involve the perspective of the poor themselves

in each field of research. The five most important areas are as follows:

<ul>

<li>The perception of urban problems among the poor and the survival strategies they have developed as

the basis for policy. 

<li>Regular research in countries which are selected, especially in concentration cities, into the effect of

macro-economic policy on urban poverty. 

<li>The conditions which will allow poor people's organisations to have an effective influence on local

urban policy, for the benefit of the policy of NGOs and local and national authorities.

<li>The role of NGOs and companies in training young people.

<li>The integration and disintegration of groups of migrants in towns and the survival strategy at

household level, especially in women-maintained households.

<h2 align=center> HOW TO PHASE OUT CHILD LABOUR IN FOOTBALL PRODUCTION
     WITHOUT DRIVING CHILDREN INTO POVERTY</h2>

<h4>13 February 1997</h4>



     
      
     
     On Friday 14 February, Save the Children (UK) will lend its support to 
     sporting
     goods companies and other children's rights groups who are working 
     towards
     phasing out child labour from the production of soccer balls in 
     Pakistan. Vital to the
     plan are steps to ensure that the situation is not made worse for 
     children. Details
     of the initiative will be announced at a press conference in Atlanta 
     USA (12.00
     noon, or 5pm UK time - for details, see below).<p> 
     
     Pakistan is the source of approximately 75% of the world's annual 
     sales of hand-
     stiched soccer balls, an industry estimated to involve 7,000 children 
     under the age
     of 14. Save the Children believes that an immediate boycott of the 
     industry could
     have a very negative effect by reducing vital family income and 
     pushing children
     into potentially more hazardous and exploitative forms of work. 
     However, this
     proposed action programme is much more realistic in that it allows for 
     the gradual
     phasing out of child workers over a period of 18 months while 
     providing them with
     practical support. It will be particularly important for families to 
     find alternative
     sources of income. Crucially the initiative has the backing of sports 
     manufacturers
     themselves.<p>
     
     David Husselbee, Save the Children's Field Director in Pakistan, who 
     will be
     speaking at the press conference on Friday said:<p>
     <blockquote>
          "Save the Children has been working with Pakistani soccer ball
          manufacturers for several months to ensure that their commitment 
     to end
          child labour in their industry is complemented by other efforts 
     to ensure that
     
          children removed from work do not end up in more damaging 
     physical or
          economic circumstances. This partnership offers the promise of 
     substantial
          additional resources from the ILO and UNICEF to assist at-risk 
     children and
          their families."<p>                             
     </blockquote>
     
     More than 50 sporting goods brands including Adidas, Mitre, Nike, 
     Puma, and
     Reebok have pledged to purchase balls produced in Pakistan only from 
     local
     manufacturers that participate in the monitoring programme. <p>
     
     Save the Children joins the World Federation of the Sporting Goods 
     Industry
     (WFSGI), the Soccer Industry of America, the International Labour 
     Organisation,
     and UNICEF (among others) in putting together a plan for action. This 
     will include
     a social protection programme to provide educational and other 
     opportunities to
     children removed from the industry, as well as a system for 
     independent
     monitoring to ensure that child labour is phased out by participating 
     manufacturers
     within 18 months.<p>
     
     Says David Husselbee:<p>
     <blockquote>
          "With all the best intentions, phasing out child labour in this 
     industry will not
          work unless an independent removal and monitoring system is put 
     in place.
          This has to take account of the best interests of affected 
     children, and it has
          to be phased in over a period of time so that there is time to 
     develop
          effective social programmes and alternative sources of income for 
     the
          families affected. Save the Children intends to work with the 
     industry and
          other partners to make sure that this is achieved."<p>
     
    </blockquote>

<h2>UNICEF Rwanda Emergency Programme</h2>
<h3>Briefing Notes on Rwanda</h3>
<h4>1. Update on situation in SW Rwanda (Kibeho)</h4>
<ul><li>Before the forced clearing of the camps, there were approximately 240,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in the SW in 13 camps.
<li>Largest camps were Kibeho and Ndago - together about 200,000.
<li>Agencies recognise need and right of Government to reduce security risks in these camps, training was going on, arms were available, intimidation of IDP's were going on, incursions from Zaire for sabotage are common.<p>

<li>However, the rapid clearance of the camps caused numerous deaths of innocent civilians, including many women and children.  UNICEF deplores the killing, in particular the killing of women and children, but these figures are disputed by Government as too high and by some NGO's as too low.  The president of Rwanda and the UN Secretary General have called for a Commission to be formed to investigate the events leading  up to the clearance of the camp and the killings that took place.  The Commission should start its work this week.<p>

<li>More than 1,500 Unaccompanied Children (UAC) have been moved by UNICEF and others from Kibeho to Butare, Gitarama and other locations with UAC centres.  Most are in centres with NGO's providing shelter, water and care.  By 22 April all UAC were evacuated from Kibeho, following agreement with Government.  UNICEF has provided UNIMIX, Water bladders, tents, milk, emergency health kits (each enough for 10,000 people for 3 months), HP biscuits, medical supplies and equipment.
<li>We have our office in Butare, which is catering to the most immediate needs.  This team has been strengthened by additional health, water and social assistant staff to provide support to the emergency relief operations.<p>

<li>Current situation:  Only very few left in Kibeho and other camps (approximately 1,000 in Kibeho).  Most others have fled first to Butare and Gitarama, and subsequently to their home communes (walking or transported by UN).  The remaining population includes a very large number of women and children and UNICEF has been involved with The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), UNAMIR, WHO and others to negotiate the delivery of food and water to these people.  The majority of the people inside have thus far refused to leave the compound, despite atrocious sanitary conditions.  An outbreak of Cholera may be possible if conditions are not improved immediately.<p>

<li>UNICEF continues to monitor the situation and provide assistance to those in need of emergency relief.  We will also continue to support the provision of support to communes of return, water, health facilities, education, relief supplies, technical assistance.</ul>


<a name="basic"></a><h3>2. Basic Information</h3>
The UNICEF Rwanda Emergency Operations began in May 1994 (in Ngara Tanzania and cross-border relief from Uganda into Rwanda).  UNICEF had an early presence in Rwanda for relief assistance - 2 people were in Kigali continuously from May-July 1994.  A full office was set-up in August 1994.  The office covers operations inside Rwanda, in Goma, Bukavu, and provides financial and technical assistance to the Tanzania-based programme in Ngara.  The current operation thus covers (unusually) areas in 3 countries, given distances, relative ease of access, and common populations.  A gradual re-phasing of activities to the host country offices is planned in 1995-96.  This will depend somewhat on the decision of refugees to return home - thus the long-term nature of the refugee population.<p>

The pre-war budget of UNICEF Rwanda was approximately $3.0 - $4.0 million per year.  However, given the 
very large assistance requirements in the country and the support required to the refugee population, the actual expenditure for July-December 1994 surpassed $40.0 million.  The planned budget for 1995 is $66 million of which $55 million is for inside Rwanda and $11 million for the adjacent refugee areas.<p>


Current estimates of affected population is indicated below:<p>

<h3>3. Major Programme Areas - UNICEF Rwanda Emergency Programme</h3><p>

<h4>Traditional UNICEF areas</h4>
<ul><li>Health:  Rehabilitation of health centres (150 planned of 307 pre-war, work begun in 27, being prepared in 66); repair of central medical store (done and now functioning); provision of medical equipment, supplies and medicines;  Reactivation of national vaccination programme (210 centres of 307 now operational); preventive health and health education (training conducted for malaria, hygiene, HIV/AIDS, ARI); emergency support to IDP's and camps,  AIDS/HIV prevention (focus on youth).  In camps, support to UNHCR and NGOs for provision of essential medicines and drugs, vaccination services for refugees and local population (Zaire and Tanzania), support to health care services for Unaccompanied children's centres.<p>

<li>Nutrition & HFS:  Supplementary feeding in camps and for UAC - UNIMIX; nutrition surveillance starting, training and support to nutrition centres (UNICEF will rehabilitate 106 of 278 nutrition centres);  Women's credit facilities are being reinitiated, support for food production within context of IDP's and support to area-based activities (distribution of seeds and tools and technical support to 12 communes).  Support to Ministry of the Family and Women's Promotion for review and eventual revision of laws pertaining to women.  In camps,  support and to supplementary feeding of unaccompanied children and for growth monitoring at health centres.<p>

<li>Education:  Provision of Teacher Emergency Package of education materials (TEP's or 'school in a box') in Rwanda and in camps - 7,500 distributed.  Curriculum development, textbook development and support to production, development of Education for Peace programme, teacher training for TEP's and for regular school, teacher training in trauma recovery.  In camps, development of basic schooling programme with TEPs, curriculum and organization with UNHCR and NGOs.<p>

<li>Water and sanitation:  Provision of emergency water assistance for IDPs, refugees and returnees.  This includes drilling wells in Ngara, trucking water to camps in Zaire and Rwanda and provision of chemicals and equipment for water distribution.  Repair and rehabilitation of urban and rural water schemes support to operation of key urban water schemes (coverage of urban water supply now at pre-war levels), support to donor consortium to repair electrical grid line in Rwanda to ensure long-term sustainability of water supply.  Hygiene education.</ul><p>

<h3>Areas specific to Rwanda Emergency Operations</h3>
<ul><li>Children in Especially Difficult Circumstances (CEDC): UNICEF is focal point for issues dealing with children inside Rwanda and has joint responsibility with UNHCR for children's issues in all camps.  Special programmes for <i>Unaccompanied Children</i> (UAC) including identification, family tracing, direct support to children, to fostering and family follow-up.  To date nearly 9, 000 children have been re-united with their families thanks to the combined work of UNICEF, ICRC, SCF, UNHCR and several NGOs.  Photographic programme with ICRC and UNHCR in camps and inside Rwanda (12,000 children photographed in Goma and over 8,000 children in centres inside Rwanda) is now accelerating the tracing process.  Posters with photos assist the parents and relatives to find their children.<p>

<li>Develop and carry-out a programme with Government and NGOs for moving <i>child prisoners</i> from currently overcrowded prisons to separate detention centres.  The first 200 children should be moved this month, once the new facility is available.  UNICEF is also providing education materials (TEPs), recreation equipment, trauma counselling and legal assistance to children accused of participating in the genocide.<p>

<li>develop and organise a programme for the <i>demobilisation of child soldiers</i>.  Inside Rwanda approximately 2,000 children are being removed from their current military context to a centre in Butare.  Support for education, counselling, parent tracing and fostering will be included in the programme.  A further 1, 500 child soldiers outside Rwanda (with former government) are also being demobilised.<p>

<li><i>Trauma recovery programme:</i>  training, development of materials, counselling, development and support for a national trauma recovery centre.  Over 2,000 social agents have been trained (teachers, care givers in orphanages, NGO staff, health workers and religious/community leaders).  Mass media campaign for radio with dialogue on trauma and support in Kinyarwanda.  Pilot surveys of children and women done, survey of 2,200 children throughout Rwanda will be carried out this month.  National seminar on trauma and bereavement held on 5-6 April as part of national week of mourning.  National trauma recovery centre will be opened this month for documentation, training and treatment.<p>

<li>Institutional support: To commune level development - provision of equipment, supplies and temporary personnel for commune level development.  Support to central ministries and physical rehabilitation of infrastructure, transport and logistics.</ul>

<a name="funding"></a><p>
<h3>4.  Current funding Situation 1995</h3>
<ul><li>The UNICEF portion of the 1995 Consolidated Appeal seeks a total of $66.0 million of which $55.0 million was for inside Rwanda and an additional $11.0 million for UNICEF support programmes in the refugee areas of E.Zaire and N.Tanzania.  The impressive response to the 1994 appeal and the gradual contributions (some received in November and December) allowed UNICEF to carry-over more than $20.0 million to 1995.  These funds are exhausted and UNICEF is now operating on a very limited budget of approximately $8.0 million received to date against the 1995 appeal.  Funding needs against currently available grants are indicated in the table below.</ul><p>

Sources of Funding:<br>
<ul>45%   National Committees for UNICEF and other private fund-raising.<br>
32%   Bilateral.<br>
23%   Multilateral (World Bank, ECHO, UNFPA, WHO)</ul>

<a name="donor"></a><p>
<h3>5.  Donor Reporting</h3>
UNICEF Rwanda has received more than 100 individual contributions from over 50 separate donors.  We have now completed the first overall Progress Report covering the period of May 1994 - March 1995 (copies available).  This will be submitted to all donors along with a short detailed description of the utilisation of their specific donation.  We have tried to develop a format that is informative and interesting to donors without being overly burdensome to the UNICEF operations.

<h2>Statement by Dr. (Mrs.) Attiya Inayatullah<p>


President of IPPF<p>


on <p>


World Population Day<p>


11 July 1996 </h2><br clear=all>

<hr width=71%></center><p>



<blockquote>
On this World Population Day, IPPF urges the global community to live up to the promises made at recent international conferences by incorporating the human right to sexual and reproductive health care into their national policies and by allocating the funding necessary to make these promises a reality. <p>




The UN-sponsored conferences of the past few years - particularly the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, the World Social Summit in Copenhagen, the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women and the Conference on Human Settlements in Istanbul - have been valuable tools for discussion and consensus building. We have witnessed in recent years, an international community that is ready for change - that through its acceptance of the lofty language of conference documents, has signalled its willingness to accept people-centred development as the only kind of development that is truly sustainable and acceptable.<p>




The Habitat II Conference which took place in Istanbul in June brought to a close the series of world conferences designed to move the focus of the UN member states from the traditional concepts of security towards sustainable development. For the past few years the world community has debated development from the point of view of environment, social issues, population, women and finally human settlements.<p>




The subjects of these conferences were of direct concern to IPPF which worked throughout to emphasise that sexual and reproductive health care and rights were important components of sustainable development. <p>




In Cairo at the International Conference on Population and Development, we were able to help the global community move away from the demographic way of thinking about population programmes toward the human dimension which recognises reproductive health as fundamental to population and development policies and initiatives. In Beijing at the Forth World Conference on Women, we helped the global community recognise and accept the pivotal role of women's empowerment and rights in achieving healthy families and communities and in overall economic and social development. In Istanbul at the Habitat II Conference, we joined together with our partners in development to ensure that the "human" element - particularly as it pertained to women, young people, and the maginalized - was front and centre in the discussion on human settlements. The outcome of the Habitat II Conference was significant because, as the last of the series of international conference in the millennium, it protected the advances made in Cairo and Beijing and went an important  step further by recognising women's rights to inheritance and ownership of property. <p>




Since the Cairo Conference nearly two years ago governments in some countries have made real progress. In Pakistan and Thailand for example, the governments are increasing spending on reproductive health programmes and on education for girls and women. South Africa has begun nationwide public consultations on new reproductive health and population policies. India has passed a national law banning sex selective abortion. New Zealand has passed progressive human rights legislation that includes sexual rights protection. Canada has become one of the first countries to recognise Female Genital Mutilation as grounds for refugee status in that country.<p>




But much more work needs to be done. Each year nearly 600,000 women continue to die from problems associated with pregnancy and childbirth. Twenty million women have unsafe abortions each year and tens of thousands die as a result. Fifteen million teenage girls give birth yearly. Pregnancy and childbirth is the biggest killer within this age group.<p>




Despite promises made in Cairo of an extra $12 billion in funding for population-related activities, family planning and sexual and reproductive health continue to be viewed by most countries as a consumer sector for which a few dollars are reluctantly spent. Yet for half of that - the amount it cost to build 10 B-2 Stealth Aircraft or 5 Trident nuclear submarines - the entire maternal health and education of the women of the world could be paid for.<p>




IPPF and its member Family Planning Associations are determined to integrate the goals agreed to at Cairo and the other global conferences into their work. FPAs sometimes with the help of other agencies and governments member, are making a difference. In Russia for example the FPA through programmes to disseminate information and provide access to services has helped reduce the high number of abortions performed. In Mexico the FPA has created successful programmes to encourage men to take responsibility for their sexual and reproductive behaviour. In Kenya the FPA has started a successful advocacy programme which is helping to change public attitudes toward the harmful practice of Female Genital Mutilation. <p>




Let us use World Population Day to mark the beginning of a new era for development - where IPPF and its global partners form the bridges of communication, using their foundations of grassroots pragmatism to help governments shape constructive policies and wisely use their limited financial resources to ensure healthy lives for women, children and men everywhere.</blockquote><p>

<center><h2>TANZANIAN PUPILS SAMPLE BRITISH LIFE</h2></center>

A group of Tanzanian students visiting Britain for the first time say our weather is similar to theirs - well, they did visit in the middle of a July heatwave!<p>

The east African students, from Shambalai School in Lushoto, were on a three-week visit to St Bedes School in Redhill, Surrey. Their visit was part of an exchange scheme between the two schools dating back to 1989. Highlights included a trip to the Rover car factory in Cowley, Oxfordshire, and a visit to the Houses of Parliament where they met Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development.<p>

Last year pupils from St Bedes visited Shambalai School in Tanzania.  For many of them, it was their first experience of Africa - and they found a warm welcome.<p>

<i>"We were all overwhelmed by the friendliness of the Tanzanians and how they went out of their way to help us," &nbsp;</i>remembers Alice Lear. <p>

Louise Barton, another pupil, noticed that Tanzanian students were less keen on fashion than British teenagers. <i>"The Shambalai students consider clothes a necessity and not a fashion statement," &nbsp;</i>she said. <p>

Timothy Larcombe summed up the trip: <i>"It was the experience of a lifetime," &nbsp;</i>he says.<p>
<hr width=60%>
<br><br>

A visit to the Cowley car plant in Oxford helped 18-year-old Erick Justin make up his mind about  his future. <p>
<i>"I enjoyed the car visit best," he says. "We saw how cars were made - now I want to go to college to study engineering."&nbsp;</i><br><br><br><br><br clear=all><hr width=60%>

<br>
<i>"Most of the families are very small,"&nbsp;</i> says Sylvia Denis, 17, who is one of  five brothers and two sisters. <i>"It's good because it's easier to take care of the children."&nbsp;</i><p>

Other plusses included computers, the "beautiful houses" and the food (chips, chicken and beef). Sylvia finds the British days too long though: in Tanzania it's dark by 6 pm.<br><br><br clear=all>

<hr width=60%>

<br><br>
<i>"Families are very different," &nbsp;</i>says 18-year-old Daniel Herman.<i> "In Tanzania, the women and the girls do the cooking. Here, even the fathers cook for their children.<p>


"But people are so busy here, they don't have time to talk to each other."&nbsp;</i><br><br><br><br clear=all>
<hr width=60%>
<br><br><br>

Like Erick, 18-year-old Hyasinta Lucas enjoyed the visit to the  car factory best. Other likes include the air conditioning, the food, television and British family life. <p>
Any dislikes? <i>"Only  that some of the skirts are too short,"&nbsp;</i> she says.<br><br><br clear=all>

<center><h3>SIXTH-FORMERS TO SPEND DAY AS WORLD LEADERS</h3></center>

Sixth-formers are being invited to spend the day as diplomats, presidents and prime ministers in eight mock international debates during the autumn.
Pupils will debate world issues in a role-play based on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which this year will take place in Auckland, New Zealand.<p>

The schools conferences will focus on trade, aid and debt; the environment and development; the Commonwealth and the 'new world order'; and human rights.

<center><h4>CARE launches telephone info line</h4></center>

The aid agency CARE has launched a telephone service to give callers up-to-date information on its work around the world.<p>

Callers to the 'dispatches' service, which was launched in May, hear a two-minute pre-recorded message on CARE's work in developing countries such as Egypt and India and in war zones like Bosnia and  Afghanistan. 
The messages, which are updated weekly, are recorded by CARE workers overseas.<p>

<i>"Dispatches would be suitable for schoolchildren doing projects on particular countries,"&nbsp;</i> says press officer Antony Robbins. <i>
"What makes this service special is that these messages are from people in the field, so callers can get an overview of our projects all over the world."&nbsp;</i><p>

You can hear 'Dispatches'  by telephoning +44 (0)171 284 5052 at normal BT rates.

Refugees, displaced persons and development cooperation</h2>

<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>

<p>

Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 6, October 1993</h4>

<h5>The full text of the report in English, as well as a list of other publications, are available free of

charge from the Council's secretariat: E-mail: nar-dgis@dgis.minbuza.nl</h5>

</center>

<hr>

<b>The 102nd report of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) on the

relationship between development cooperation and the refugee problem was presented to Mr J P Pronk,

Minister for Development Cooperation, at the beginning of October 1993.</b>

<p>

<h3>Summary of the problems and questions considered in the report</h3>



How can development cooperation help to prevent large-scale flows of refugees and combat and/or help to

forestall their negative consequences? How can host countries - developing countries in particular - be

assisted in dealing with an influx of refugees and displaced persons? These were the questions posed by the

Minister in his request for recommendations on the refugee issue. Another was how can support be given to

sustainable solutions to the refugee problem other than asylum in the region? It is a fact that more people

than ever before are now fleeing. Current estimates indicate that twenty million people have left their home-

land, while a similar number have been driven out of their homes, albeit not out of their country of origin.

The great majority of them are women and children fleeing from one developing country to another. Many

of them wait to return, sometimes for decades, in desolate camps. The report is principally concerned with

aid to such people, and definitely not with migrants coming to Europe in search of work. It does, however,

discuss the changes that the definition of a refugee has undergone in the last ten or twenty years. The

Council would associate itself with the policies developed by the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.

<p>

However, we have to be very cautious concerning the potential contribution of development cooperation to

resolving the refugee problem. After all, the question of the extent to which economic underdevelopment is

responsible for creating refugee flows is well-nigh impossible to answer. The connection between economic

inequality and violent social upheaval is a highly complex one. Nevertheless, development cooperation is

increasingly called upon to serve as a preventive instrument, and speculation is voiced about reducing the

numbers of asylum seekers by "developing" poor regions. Leaving aside the incentive to poor government

which would result from such a policy, it is a formula that takes no account whatever of the capriciousness

and unpredictability of the refugee problem. The Council wold argue that economic underdevelopment as

such is not a major cause of refugee flows.

<p>

The question even arises of whether conflicts are inherent in the development process itself, since

development implies social change and the emergence of a new situation affecting relations between groups

and the relationship between people and their environment. Such a process rarely proceeds smoothly. Some

critics say that the current economic crisis, with all the violence it entails (such as increasing domestic and

international crime rates, conflicts involving the use of force, civil wars, drug trafficking and damage to the

environment) is the product of the dominant Western-style development model.

<p>

On the other hand, development cooperation can be seen as a potential way of preventing the conflicts which

give rise to refugee flows. Improved living standards might forestall conflicts caused by scarcity, ecological

degradation or economic inequality. However, as stated above, the causes of refugee flows are legion: the

formation of states and nations, decolonisation, sometimes linked with economic factors, problems of

institutional development, and not least environmental degradation. Violations of human rights, life-

threatening violence and national or ecological disasters drive vast numbers of people to abandon the scene

of their misfortune. Alongside the wider reality of persecution in general can be found the more personal,

individual motive of fear. All this is closely related to changes in the identity of the population of developing

countries, changes brought about to some extent by education and development, resulting in a new sense of

individuality. Such values as autonomy, personal liberty, responsibility, mutual respect and, above all,

guarantees of physical integrity thus acquire a new meaning, particularly for young people, as a result of

which violence in society is more frequently regarded as unjust and unacceptable. This may lead to political

radicalisation and hence the need to flee. At the same time, however, the numbers participating in what are

increasingly rigid political processes are declining all the time and collective action is hardly an option. In

that case there is nothing for politically aware young people in the South to do but leave. Their main

motives for doing so are - in that event - by no means economic. In general they would have stayed if they

could have been guaranteed freedom from violence or from the caprices of an unpredictable tyranny. 

<p>

<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>



The Council therefore believes that development policy should be based to a greater extent on concepts of

social, economic and cultural diversity as the foundation of self-elected development from the bottom up. In

the long term a policy of this kind can have a preventive, or at least moderating, effect on polarisation and

violent outbursts of idiosyncratic fundamentalism. Moreover, as stated in NAR report no. 100, many

developing countries are the victims of skewed growth, with the result that the structure of society has

become one-sided, being dominated by economic institutions or an overgrown state apparatus. Skewed

growth of this kind often leads to social tensions, which sometimes spill over into violence, forming an

obstacle to efforts to achieve sustainable development.

<p>

In this connection the Council feels that fostering respect for human rights is vital. Measures such as early

warning systems, the physical presence of international organisations and the promotion of good governance

can have a direct preventive effect. The Council would recommend that support be given to human rights

organisations, more particularly if human rights violations are on the increase. This should be extended to

include working with other organisations which are sensitive to human rights issues, such as trade unions

and women's organisations. Early reporting of trends in the area of human rights violations is likewise

called for. Local embassies should report on law enforcement and the beginnings of trends such as

disappearances, incarceration and executions. Good reporting on human rights violations and incipient

refugee flows could also help to raise awareness of the problems, as could invitations to and assignments of

journalists and commissioning television documentaries from journalists in the relevant countries. As part of

enhanced conditionality,  all industrialised countries should declare themselves willing to accept international

monitoring of observance of human rights in their own region, in the same way as most of the states of

Europe have done by means of the European Convention on Human Rights.

<p>

The Council wishes to point out once again that 80% of the world's refugees are women and children. It

would be advisable for this to be stressed at both bilateral and multilateral level, and for policy to take

account of this fact.

<p>

The Council is very concerned to note that no more than 35% of total Dutch development aid expenditure in

1992 on refugee aid (including reception facilities for asylum seekers) went to refugees in developing

countries. This percentage is in danger of declining even further in the near future. The Council would urge

that a halt be called to this trend, adding that the provision of reception facilities for asylum seekers in the

Netherlands should no longer be paid for out of the development cooperation budget.

<p>

Asylum in the region certainly merits support. It must be remembered that what is referred to as the cultural

region for some refugees is situated in the West rather than in countries near their country of origin. Some

years ago, for example, it would have been improper for Bhutto supporters from Pakistan who sought refuge

in London to have been sent back to a camp in the sub-continent. The Council recommends that a distinction

be drawn between the policy field relating to Dutch admission and reception problems and that relating to

assistance to refugees in developing countries. Moreover, given the different timescales involved, simply

linking policy on refugees and asylum seekers with development cooperation would be in the interests of

neither.

<p>

The Council believes that development cooperation should be involved in voluntary repatriation projects for

refugees. Both bilateral and multilateral efforts can be effective, particularly in relation to the reconstruction

of a country. The restoration of human rights - political, social and economic - should also be actively

promoted. If voluntary repatriation is to work in the long term, conditions in the home country must be such

that those who return are never again compelled to seek refuge elsewhere.

<p>

Development cooperation should give more consideration to social structures in a post-conflict situation.

This means doing more to reconcile warring factions. Links could be sought with an international policy on

organising peace through development which is gradually taking shape. The Council also believes that

consideration should be given to the problem of the millions of people who have been living in exile for

many years in refugee communities with political leadership structures and military wings which wage war

for political ends. Their existence not only creates problems as far as fund-raising is concerned but also

poses dilemmas in terms of international law, since refugee status is incompatible with armed political

activism.

<p>

Refugees and their own organisations in the West should be closely involved with both repatriation projects

and reconciliation processes. Their knowledge, experience and dedication as regards development projects in

their countries of origin would then be doubly effective. Such involvement would help to stem the brain

drain from developing countries, as highly-qualified persons could contribute to the reconstruction of their

countries while Western donors could take advantage of refugees' expertise.

<p>

The Council is of the opinion that support should be given to regional, integrated approaches, which

embrace political, economic and development-related aspects of the problems associated with refugees

and/or those returning home. Such an approach requires coordination, particularly between (and within) the

UN and the EC and the various international aid organisations. The UNHCR is attempting to expand its

programmes and step up its activities. The Council believes that generous support should be given to the

UNHCR in this, as in its more traditional activities, namely increasing and improving emergency aid in

collaboration with other international organisations, donor governments and NGOs, increasing scope for

voluntary repatriation of refugees, for example by the introduction of quick impact development projects, the

resettlement of refugees whose lives or fundamental wellbeing would otherwise be threatened and measures

to improve the protection afforded refugees.

<TR><TD>Abstract <TD>In the following article, it is argued, unlike commonly held assumptions about the impossibility of Latin American cooperation, that recent empirical evidence authorize a different and more optimistic view on the subject.  The author sustains that after experiencing a serious economic and political crisis during the first half of the Eighties, three    regional cooperation systems (Central America, the English Speaking Caribbean, and the Southern Cone) begun to recover their strength during the second half of the past decade.  The article further contends that whilst it is true that trade and financial flows are important indicators, more attentions should be devoted to the position adopted by the regional and extra-regional powers (i.e. hegemony in international relations) if we want to have a correct assessment of Latin American cooperation and its possibilities of success.                                         Finally, the author suggests that EC aid to Latin America would gain greater significance if, instead of been mostly bilateral, it were given by the EC to the Latin American coopereation systems.

A fact-finding mission has been interviewing refugees who fled from Grozny, the Chechen capital, and the surrounding missions and is reporting its findings in a series of information bulletins, the first which was published in January 1995. Updated bulletins are expected to follow in the months ahead.</i><hr>According to the HRW researchers, Russian security forces have shown utter contempt for civilian lives in its efforts to suppress revolt in the breakaway republic. Both victims and witnesses have reported Russian bombs, shells and mortar fire levelling apartment buildings, entire neighbourhoods, and single-family homes in Grozny. The Russians have also been hitting civilian areas in outlying villages both in Chechnya and in neighbouring Ingushetia. <p>HRW maintains that Russia's consistent pattern of firing on civilians grossly violates its humanitarian law obligations set out in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their 1977 Second Protocol, which governs internal armed conflict. The Geneva Conventions strictly forbid indiscriminate fire and targeting civilians, and oblige Russian forces at all times to prevent harm to civilians. Russia has similar obligations under United Nations rules adopted in 1969. <p>HRW says that it condemns "in the strongest terms" the conduct of Russian forces and calls upon Russian President Boris Yeltsin to end the indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians and civilian property. It also calls upon the Russian leader to condemn these attacks, and to punish, in a manner consistent with international law, those responsible for carrying them out. Similarly, HRW calls upon Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin to enforce adherence to the Geneva Conventions by the Russian Army and Interior Ministry commanders and troops, and to announce publicly that violations of humanitarian law will be punished. <p>(Human rights observers at the Geneva Human Rights Commission in February noted that even with the Russian takeover of the Chechen capital, fighting may not come to an end but is expected to move to other areas, many of them with large civilian populations.)<p>HRW also criticized the Clinton Administration in the United States for losing an opportunity to take an early stand against the slaughter in Chechnya. It first made mild calls for Russian restraint and characterized the conflict as "an internal matter", even though the rules of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) consider that gross violations of human rights are the concern of all member states. Only after public criticism of its position and after its European partners deplored Russian conduct did the US government show appropriate concern, HRW maintains. In contrast, Western European governments were quick to condemn Russian conduct in Chechnya and to threaten sanctions. The Council of Europe, for example, has suspended temporarily Russia's application for admission, which is premised on respect for human rights principles.<p><hr>For further information contact: Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10017-6104, USA.

<html><head><title>Womankind Worldwide - Newsletter</title></head><body bgcolor="bdfbc0" text="000000" link="9306a9" vlink="502c88"><h1 align=center><img width=589 height=77 src="newsletter_logo.jpg" ></h1><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="../wk_info.html">Womankind Worldwide</a></i><hr><h1 align=center>Making a will</h1><font size=+1>If sorting out your will is something you have been meaning to do for ages but just haven't got around to yet, you are not alone. In fact, three quarters of the population have never made a will. Yet, making a will can be quite simple and takes a lot less effort than people imagine.</font><h4>Why make a will?</h4>By making a will, you can be sure that those close to you will benefit from your estate in accordance with your wishes. Many people underestimate the money and assets they have to leave to their family, friends or favorite good cause. A small property added to a car, and maybe an insurance policy or one or two items of value, can easily mount up to quite a considerable estate.<p>If a person dies without leaving a valid will, they are said to have died intestate and their estate is divided among certain relatives according to the laws of intestacy. Of course, the way in which the law divides up your estate may not reflect your wishes.<p>For instance, many people assume that if they are married and die intestate, everything automatically goes to their wife or husband. This is not necessarily the case by any means. In fact, a spouse may have to share the estate with children or other relatives. There have been cases where a surviving husband or wife has had to sell the family home in order to pay a relative's share of their partner's estate. For the growing number of couples who choose to live together without being married, many do not realise that a common law husband or wife is not entitled to any part of their partner's estate unless they are specifically mentioned in their will.<p>The laws of intestacy are fascinating and it is worth finding out more about them. There are easy to read books available for the lay person. Nevertheless, the one sure way to guarantee your money will be divided according to your wishes is to take the time now to make a will.<p><h4>How to make a will</h4>Writing your own will is easier than most people think. There are helpful 'DIY' packs and books available from leading stationers and book shops. In fact, 1 in 5 people do write their own will. However, we would recommend that you seek professional assistance from a solicitor or your bank, especially if your affairs are at all complicated. <p>One area where professional advice may be able to help is by advising you on how you might reduce or avoid inheritance tax. In general, if the value of what you leave in your will, added to the value of any gifts made over the last seven years, is more than £150,000 then inheritance tax is payable on the excess ( unless bequeathed to your spouse ).<p>If you already have a will, it is worth reviewing it every once in a while and keeping it up to date with your personal circumstances. It is important to remember that in most circumstances your existing will be completely revoked if you get married. Minor alterations, such as including additional beneficiaries, can be made as a codicil to your will but it might be better to write a new will if there are major alterations. ( Make sure you destroy the old one ! ) <p><h4>Remembering a good cause</h4>Remembering a charity in your will is a wonderful way of leaving a gift that will go on doing good work in your memory. <p>Legacies already make a considerable contribution to the excellent work carried out by the voluntary sector. Every year, people in England and Wales alone leave between £600 and £700 million to charities. This accounts for about one-third of all voluntary income. The outstanding work of British charities could not continue without the generosity of ordinary people who remember their favourite cause in their will.<p>We hope that you, our supporters, will remember the lives of women in developing countries when you come to write or modify your will. We are still a very young charity and, as to be expected, our income from legacies is small. However, as we look towards our long term future, it is our hope that some of our vital work can be supported in this way. <p>A gift in your will towards the work of WOMANKIND will be a departing gesture of hope and encouragement to women in developing countries who face hardship and prejudice every day of their lives. Whatever you leave, it will help to support their unfailing courage and determination to get their voices heard and to make the most of their tremendous talents, vision and hard work.<p>If you are considering leaving a bequest to WOMANKIND in your will, we do have a leaflet setting out approved wording which we would be happy to send you. Please call Simona on 0181 563 8607 and ask to be sent our 'Have you the Will?' leaflet.<p><h3 align=center>Make a Will Week, organised by The Law Society, will run from 16 to 22 October this year.</h3><b><a href="index.html">Contents Page</a></b><p><hr><p>©Copyright:1996 Womankind Worldwide<hr></body></html>

<html><head><title>Crosslines: Chechnya - How best to express concern</title><!!keys: Crosslines+Chechnya+war+violence+migration+Russia></head><body><img src="crosslines_pix/crosslines_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="crosslines.html"> CROSSLINES</i></a><hr><h2>Chechnya: how best to express concern</h2><i>Even if a prolonged military ceasefire is achieved in Grozny and other parts of Chechnya, it will not necessarily mean an end to the fighting. <b>Tamara Dragadze, </b>a London-based analyst of Georgian origin, seeks to explain some of the reasons behind Russia's invasion of the territory and the challenges facing a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</i><hr>The sheer brutality of the war against the Chechens makes it difficult to see a way forward, how to play our part as concerned human beings, let alone specialists in the fields of Caucasian studies, politics, humanitarian aid or peace movements. Should our anger or concern be directed towards galvanizing Western governments into paying more political attention to the facts presented to them? Or should the warring parties themselves be confronted in their faraway lands?<p>One of the problems facing potential mediators is that it will prove difficult to decide where and with whom real peace talks should take place. There is certainly no enmity between local Russians and Chechens. Both have suffered from Russian army assaults. A majority of Russians polled have declared themselves against fighting the Chechens. Nor is the current war in Chechnya an "ethnic conflict" -- a buzzword which should be kept out of every reference to the invasion. So it seems that Western charitable organizations seeking to promote conciliation and dialogue, at least at the grassroots level, are not needed. The more one learns about the background of this war, the more complex it becomes to determine whom to target to bring an end to the fighting.<p>As one Russian journalist put it, Yeltsin is now a pseudonym for the unelected clique presently ruling Russia, which has emerged as the furtive instigator of this war. It is therefore difficult to expect such a secretive band to be willing to receive delegations of peacemakers composed of the world's great and good, however imposing or colourful, seeking to persuade Moscow to negotiate with the Chechens. Yet there are Russian politicians, journalists and citizens-at-large who are equally concerned about these developments. They are attempting to resist them and have demanded Western support to help bring about reforms and an end to the fighting.<p>For the war to stop, however, this clique will either have to be disbanded entirely, preferably by democratic means, or persuaded to relinquish its current military operations. It is perhaps in this context that human rights advocates, pressure groups, and other concerned individuals must seek a way forward.<p>The Russian military onslaught on Grozny has revealed an underbelly of authoritarian and belligerent structures in certain parts of the central government in Moscow which are genuinely threatening. The conditions prevailing in Chechnya prior to Moscow's decision to invade, particularly its timing and the way the war is now being handled, reveal ominous developments within the Russian body politic. <p>The Chechens, a mountainous people of just over a million, are indigenous to the Caucasus. They speak a language unique to the region and closely related only to the neighbouring Ingush. They have recently adopted the Latin alphabet although throughout the Soviet period they wrote in Cyrillic. They are Sunni Muslims with Sufi practices in which their folk customs and beliefs are deeply embedded; one of their forms of worship is called the zikr, where they dance and chant. Theirs is not an "imported" fundamentalist Islam from which the present Russian government has to save civilization. Chechen war cries of "Allah is Great" should be seen in their proper context. The fact that the pledge of allegiance in the United States includes a reference to "one nation under God" does not mean the American people are fanatic Christian fundamentalists.<p>The Russian justifications seeking to legitimize the assault are weak in the extreme. First, the economic argument that the three years of self-declared independence by the Chechen government leader, General Dzhokhar Dudayev, has been costing the central coffers in Moscow dearly in lost revenues, is not borne out by the realities. Chechnya is only around 50,000 square kilometres, roughly the size of Costa Rica or slightly larger than Denmark. It has a little oil, around five million tonnes, which is a great asset for such a small country, but cannot compare to the vast oilfields of Siberia. Except for some industry, Chechnya consists primarily of mountain pasture. Tax revenues from local agriculture and industry are relatively insignificant for the Russian budget.<p>Another argument is that oil politics are the key to understanding - and thus forgiving - the Russian government's decision to destroy Grozny, the Chechen capital. Rebellious Chechnya allegedly thwarted Moscow's vital regional aspirations through its control of part of the oil pipeline. The Chechens have allegedly charged local passage fees, as they do in other parts of the Russian Federation, where the central government has turned a blind eye, both voluntarily or involuntarily. Chechnya, however, has continued to cooperate bilaterally with nearby Russian regions. The use of oil pipelines which traverse Grozny has been open to negotiation. Oil has never been sequestered and indeed was exported with Russian Federation licences providing some illicit gains to influential people in Moscow.<p>Interestingly, the Azerbaijani government which has just signed a large oil deal with a Western consortium has been seeking an alternative route for some time for its Caspian oil which the Russians have insisted should pass through their own territory, including Grozny. The Kazakhs are equally engaged in looking for alternative routes, to which Moscow has objected. Even if the Caspian Sea oil pipelines do not end up passing exclusively through Russian territory, the lost income to the central government will remain insignificant in comparison to the military and political cost of enforcing pipeline routes which their neighbours do not want.<p>Much has been made of the Chechen 'mafia' gangs, which the Russian assault against Grozny was supposed to destroy. These gangs are only one type of the numerous ethnically-based criminal groups inside and outside the Russian Federation. The business interests of the Chechen mafias, however, have remained based in Moscow, and it is they who have supported the largely Russian-designated Chechen opposition factions. To link the Dudayev government in Chechnya with the mightiest `mafia' gangs makes no sense, since the Chechen leader himself has been the target of serious terrorist attacks.<p>There are also clearly racist overtones in Russian references to Chechens -- and Caucasians generally -- as "bandits," or sometimes "Oriental bandits." Discriminatory practices in Moscow of charging a local tax for anyone of "Caucasian nationality," whatever that may mean, for each day spent in the capital, while turning a blind eye to other visitors, is likely to prove to be anti-constitutional. It is regrettable that by and large the racist rhetoric linking the Chechens to powerful mafiosi networks is not recognized for what it is: an attempt to mislead gullible sections of Western opinion. <p>Another reason given by the invaders was that they must free Chechnya of its "illegitimate" government and its "illegal" president. It is notable that in August 1991 Dudayev was the only leader with President Akayev of Kirghyzstan to come out wholly and unequivocally against the communist putschists in Moscow and to support Boris Yeltsin and the new democracy. A week later, however, the newly established authorities in Moscow accused the Chechens of insurrection when a majority attempted to disband the conservative Communist Supreme Soviet in their own republic.<p>The Russian government furthermore has refused to recognise the validity of the election in which Dudayev received a majority of popular support. Although not all the Chechen population voted, the proportion was no lower than that which prevailed in apathetic Russia during the 1993 elections, the legitimacy of which has never been questioned. The stand-off has resulted in three years of lost opportunities to engage in dialogue, hardly a costly activity.<p>There have been patronizing descriptions from some Moscow and Western pundits alike that Chechen politics are based on backward clan loyalties. These assumed that not only was the loyalty to the Dudayev government merely clan-based but that it was confined to a restricted number of areas. The military believed that if they conquered these, the rest of the Chechen Republic would rejoice and welcome them with free access.<p>Although the role of clans is much overstated, the way kinship links are constructed in Chechen society, whereby relatives cannot marry each other, results in people having kinship networks that spread throughout the territory. Nevertheless, this does not imply that regional political allegiances are straightforward. Given that Chechen national pride is unlikely to be easily diluted by clan rivalries, they will certainly make Russia's conquest of the whole territory long and difficult.<p>What particularly irked the central government is that the Chechens have demanded independence. This is always a relative term. Europeans are becoming acutely aware of this in the wake of the Maastricht Treaty. The Moscow authorities, it appears, have been oblivious to the impact that all their racist threats and uncertainties resulting from insufficiently democratic structures both in government and the economy have been having on the Chechens. These so frightened the Chechens that they sought independence as the only way out of their predicament. <p>Moscow's spurning of the Chechen government's calls for talks did not reflect the democratic procedures they had pledged themselves to follow. Negotiations may well have been possible in which the Russian Federation's territorial integrity could have been maintained in formal terms while not offending the Chechens' sense of self-worth, at least for the time being. Now it will prove increasingly difficult for such a compromise to be reached in any voluntary way.<p>The first significant military incursion by Tsarist Russia was in 1785-1791. The Chechens, however, scored some remarkable successes against their powerful invaders from the north. In the 19th century, Shamil led further resistance against the Russians in the North Caucasus lasting several decades. Many Chechens were finally expelled from Imperial Russia and their descendants today are dispersed in various parts of the Middle East. (See the CROSSLINES article in this issue by Marie Bennigsen Broxup). When Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev presented evidence of Middle East passport holders fighting in Chechnya as Muslim mercenaries, he conveniently concealed the fact that they have been mostly Diaspora Chechens.<p>Even when the Bolsheviks tried to subdue the North Caucasians in 1921, the inhabitants mounted an uprising. In 1944, Stalin used trumped charges to justify having the whole Chechen population deported for collaborating with the Germans who, in fact, had never made it to the territory. A significant number perished while travelling. When they were allowed to return, they found their holy shrines desecrated, family tombstones used for paving in Grozny, and they were forced to submit to a harsher political regime than other Soviet peoples in the Caucasus. <p>One poignant example of their lack of confidence in a future under the Russians is that Chechen scholars have continued for decades to be concerned about the fate of the ethnic artifacts they have gathered in their local museum. The sense of insecurity among the Chechens cannot be over-estimated. This should be taken into account in any prudent policy by Western and other governments toward them.<p>Russia's claim that the current implacable war against the Chechens is necessary to defend its statehood is not borne out by looking at the map. Chechnya is entirely landlocked within the Russian Federation with an external frontier only with Georgia. This can hardly pose a threat to Russia. Neither is it likely that the Chechens would form an ominous anti-Russian alliance with the separatist Abkhazians along the Black Sea.<p>It should not be forgotten that in 1993 Russian Defence Minister Grachev declared that Moscow had to defend the Abkhazians against the Georgians because "Russia needed an extended Black Sea coast." The boomerang effect of such policy, however, will now come to haunt him not only from Georgia. Some specialists' pleas that the Russian military industrial complex should better control its weapons inventory should have been heeded long ago; let us not forget that the Chechens are fighting with Russian weapons. <p>Besides fellow North Caucasians, other nationalities, regardless of religion, such as the West Ukrainian volunteers, have come to the aid of the Chechens. The Chechen plight which the international media has conveyed has also awakened outrage from fellow Muslims. The Russians could find themselves facing a long and costly war of attrition.<p>The democrats in Russia who oppose the war, including Nobel Peace Prize nominee Sergei Kovalyev, the human rights campaigner, and organizations such as the Soldiers' Mothers' Union have been appalled at the inept and grudging support they have received from Western governments. Seventy percent of public opinion in Moscow is against the use of brutal force as are elements within the Russian parliament and the armed forces. These opinions have to be encouraged. Otherwise Russia will return to the old ways with tanks deployed against striking miners and demonstrators, or with efforts to clampdown on free media coverage, something that has already been attempted. This is not the Russia that anyone should want. Nor is it one which the Russian people deserve.<p><hr><b>Tamara Dragadze</b> is a fellow of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London. <p>©Copyright:<b> CROSSLINES</b> Global Report 1995.

<font size=4>The people in these photographs are now too old to make economic miracles
in Hong Kong; some 10,000 of them live as outcasts in cages near the heart
of the city. <p>

<br>

In 'bedspace apartments' of 100 people or more they occupy a single bed
in rows of bunks two or three tiers high. To protect themselves and create
a symbolic sense of privacy some fix wire and locks around their bunks,
which have come to be called 'cage-homes'.<p>


<font size=2>'Miracle' makers: many of the lodgers migrated from the Chinese mainland
in the 1940s and 1950s and worked as manual labourers or on the harbour
piers. <br>

<br>

The lodgers receive a maximum pension from the Hong Kong Government of $232
per month, and pay on average $64 for their cages. They live in constant
fear of fire, theft and the spread of disease. Most suffer from respiratory
illness.  <p>

On Christmas Eve 1990 six people were killed and 50 injured in a cage-apartment
fire in Shamshuipo. On Lunar New Year's Day in 1993 Mok Choi, an elderly
lady, froze to death in the cage-apartment at 56 Fuk Tsuen Street.

<br>

The apartment blocks are constantly being demolished. The lodgers have no
security and so must somehow find another cage-home. Protests have been
made to the Hong Kong Government, which has so far made little positive
response.<p>

<font size=4 face=helvetica, arial>GLOBAL BANQUET:
TVE FILMS FOR THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT<br>
13 to 17 November 1996</font>
<p>


<font size=2 face=helvetica, arial>Dear Broadcaster,<p>

I am writing to let you know about a new series of programmes that TVE is offering for broadcast this
autumn.<p>

More people eat better than ever before - while, at the same time, more people go hungry than ever
before. It s a paradox accounted for by increasing global food production and increasing numbers of poor
people. Before the middle of the next century, the planet will have to feed 50 per cent more people than
are alive today. But increasing current food production is only one aspect of the agenda on the World
Food Summit - a better diet; security of tenure; improved marketing; soil and biodiversity conservation;
help for women farmers are others. The challenge is to provide enough food.<p>


To mark the Food Summit, TVE is producing a 30-minute special , <b><a href="food.html">FOOD FOR
THOUGHT</a></b> - which is embargoed
until the eve of the conference itself. <b><a href="food.html">FOOD FOR THOUGHT</a></b> looks at some
of the
key issues the world s governments will consider in Rome: land reform in Nepal; revival of traditional
farming in Zimbabwe; monsoon harvesting in India are among the stories currently in production. <p>


The programme begins with a five minute introductory overview. The six 
featured stories can be shown as separate items, or together as a single programme in chapters .<p>


We also have <b><a href="newprogs2.html">details of the other programmes we can provide for your
stations</a></b>.<p>


I look forward to receiving your order.<p>


Yours sincerely,<br>

What a mess! If the South uses energy in the same way as the North has done,
we are heading for a future dominated by global warming, toxic waste and
air pollution. But the arguments for sustainability do not necessarily go
hand-in- hand with those for equity. <b>Vanessa Baird</b> constructs a conversation
between <b><i>Claire</i></b>, from the energy-glutted North, and <b><i>Gloria</i></b> from the energy-starved
South. Can they ever share the same priorities - and a common vision
for the future?</font><BR>
<BR>
<hr width=71%><p>



Quickly, she moved out of the lecture hall, along the corridor and through
a pair of swinging doors, violently at odds with each other. No time to
think why it was always like this, before she reached the room with her
plaque on it: Dr Claire Green, Senior Lecturer, Renewable Energy Studies.
A student caught her eye. 'Can I talk to you?' 'Sorry. Can it wait till
next week?' A tome slipped off her pile, 1160 pages of it, entitled 'Energy
Forever'.<BR>
<BR>
'God, I could do with just a bit of it right now,' she thought as she closed
the door behind her and poured herself an evil-smelling, thick, black liquid
from the coffee maker.<BR>
<BR>
'Relax,' she told herself sternly, gazing out through the window at the
Heart of England University campus. It was one of those sunny, windy days
that should be a joy to a renewable energy freak. Her computer whirred quietly
in the background. Next to it, her answerphone was flashing. She switched
it to 'play' and heard her lover informing her that they had agreed to meet
for lunch. Remember?! Before she could make the requisite grovelling, apologetic
call, her phone buzzed. <BR>
'Your visitor from South Africa is here! Shall I send her through to you?'<BR>
<BR>
Claire did not know quite what she had expected of Gloria Thembisa, community
leader and NGO worker, with a special interest in rural energy. But when
she appeared Claire realized what she had not expected: a woman six-feet-tall,
wearing jeans and a big crimson, floppy shirt. Behind her large spectacles,
Gloria had a slight squint that gave her a permanently quizzical air. But
her smile lines were deeply etched, Claire noticed with relief. If she was
going to spend five days accompanying this woman on a study tour of energy
alternatives, a sense of humour would be a plus, if not an essential requirement.
<BR>
<BR>
After the initial polite exchanges Claire went to her printer and ripped
off a list she had prepared the previous night. 'Just a few ideas about
different kinds of energy systems your community might be interested in.'<BR>
<BR>
'Ah yes, yes. Wind, solar, wave. Mmmm, solar hydrogen. Very interesting...'
said Gloria. 'But there is something missing here. Something that really
does interest me...' <BR>
'Ah yes..?'<BR>
'Nuclear power'<BR>
'Nuclear..?'<BR>
'Yes. You have heard of it?' said Gloria, with a smile. <BR>
'Yes,' Claire flustered. 'Do you want to...'<BR>
'Visit your newest nuclear power station? Yes, I would love to!'<BR>
<BR>
Claire had a sinking feeling as she made the arrangements. 'Yes, we are
open every day of the year except Christmas here at Sizewell,' said the
chirpy voice on the other end of the line. 'You can book a tour now. And
you will probably want to spend time in our Visitors Centre... It's one
of the best in the country..'	<BR>

Population and development:<br>The road to Cairo '94</h2>

<b>

At the beginning of March 1994 the 104th report of the National Advisory Council for Development

Cooperation (NAR) was presented to the Minister for Development Cooperation, Mr J P Pronk. The report

deals with the relationship between population and development and is part of the preparation for the

International Conference on Population and Development which is to be held in Cairo in September

1994.</b>

<p>

<h3>Summary of the problem and the issues addressed in the report</h3>



How can the Netherlands contribute towards formulating and implementing population policy within the

framework of Dutch development cooperation policy? The Minister for Development Cooperation requested

the NAR to produce a report as part of the preparation for the International Conference on Population and

Development to be held in Cairo in September 1994. The Dutch delegation will be expected to present a

standpoint on abortion, the relationship between women's right not to have children and demographic aims

and the relationship between the rights of women and the responsibilities of men. The report covers these

issues.

<p>

Population policy affects people in their most intimate relationships, beliefs and values and survival

strategies, which makes it a difficult and often emotionally-charged subject. Nevertheless, it seems that

international agreement is being reached on the need to slow down the world's population growth. This is

closely related to growing interest in sustainable development in that population growth is placing an

increasing burden on the environment. However, unsustainable patterns of production and consumption are

equally harmful. The essence of the problem lies in the interrelationship between population growth and

patterns of production and consumption which are characterised by unequal distribution of resources and

power.

<p>

For the poor, children can represent security for the future. At the same time, however, it is the poor who

have limited reproductive choice owing to lack of access to family planning services. In addition, limited

access to education, health care and the labour market are further factors which lead to high fertility rates.

Population policy must therefore be embedded in strategy for combating poverty and vice versa. It is

difficult to fight poverty if the population is growing at a consistently high rate. This situation is making it

increasingly difficult to improve the lives of large sections of the population. It is clear that population

growth and poverty are interrelated.

<p>

However, population growth is not always the only problem or indeed the main problem. Geographic

distribution, the aging of the population and migration all affect population structure and give rise to

problems. Urbanisation too is becoming an extremely urgent problem. There are therefore many aspects to

the population problem and more than one solution is required.

<p>

The fertility rate, or the number of children born to each woman, varies widely depending on the

socioeconomic position of women, their cultural and religious environment and prospects, and, naturally,

those of men. However, inequality between men and women in both personal and public life is a major

influence on reproductive patterns. The joys and responsibilities of childbearing and the rearing of children

are very unequally distributed in most countries. The way in which population policy is formulated and

implemented tends to reduce women to instruments of birth control policy. Women's autonomy is restricted

and furthermore, they are burdened with the full responsibility of reducing the rate of population growth.

The needs of women are not considered enough when population policy is translated into family planning

programmes.

<p>

It is now recognised that family planning is no longer only a means of keeping the population rate down, but

that it forms part of a package of measures aimed at improving the reproductive health of women.

Reproductive health care includes the provision of contraceptives, information on the prevention, diagnosis

and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and other infections, and services to deal safely with

unwanted pregnancies. Recent information from organisations active in the field of population policy such as

UNFPA, the World Bank and the Population Council, reveal that they now use qualitative rather than

quantitative factors (including treating people with respect and providing good guidance) to measure the

success of their family planning programmes.

<p>

The trend in international debate is to place these facilities in a broader perspective: family planning is only

one means of slowing the population growth rate. After all, this growth is a result of the fertility rate and of

demographic momentum (the increase in the number of men and women of childbearing age as a result of

the rise in the birth rate of the previous generation). Family planning is effective only where there is a

desire to reduce the fertility; it has no effect on the other factors of growth. This means that population

policy must also be included as an aspect of broader socioeconomic policy, while education and health

policy must be matched to the aims of population policy. A woman's education is still the most accurate

indicator of the number of children she will bear: the more education, the fewer children.

<p>

Infant mortality is also a factor which causes uncertainty. More funds should therefore be allocated to

education and health and socioeconomic policy should ensure that the allocation of tasks between men and

women is changed. Provisions for old age not only influence the number of children people have but also

meet the needs of the increasing numbers of old people in developing countries. The aging of the population

requires that the special needs of the elderly, of whom women form a high percentage, be taken into

account when funds are allocated. Urbanisation calls for facilities for reproductive health which are

appropriate to the specific living conditions and varied patterns of sexual and reproductive behaviour in the

cities.

<p>

<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>



People must be given access to good health care and reproductive health care facilities so that they are able

to decide how many children they wish to have. This applies particularly to women who have only limited

control over their sexual relations and cannot take their own decisions on fertility. The fact that girls and

women have only limited access to education and the traditional allocation of roles in family life define the

framework within which they can make choices on having children. Legislation in many countries only

serves to reinforce the limited choice they have.

<p>

The Council believes that family planning should be part of reproductive health care. It is essential that

family planning programmes offer a wide range of high quality services. If the wrong type of birth control

is prescribed (for example the pill where there are contraindications or the IUD where there is an infection

present) or not enough information provided on side effects, women are going to be very reluctant to

participate in programmes. In addition to birth control, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted

diseases and infections of the reproductive tract should be provided. Reproductive health care services

should also be available to young people and single women. Information campaigns must make men aware

that they are responsible for their sexual behaviour and their fertility, and the consequences thereof.

<p>

Safe abortion should be included in this package. Unwanted pregnancies may result from the failure of

contraceptive devices or from the lack of effective birth control methods. However, they are often the result

of violence perpetrated against women: rape either by members of the family or others or during a war

situation. The Council is of the opinion that governments should be made aware of their responsibilities

towards women's health and that they should make safe abortion available by legalising it.

<p>

The Council objects on paying target groups to limit fertility on grounds of principle and would emphasise

the enormous practical problems involved in applying this instrument. In practice there is no cost-effective

method of guaranteeing that this type of instrument would not be open to abuse, given the context of

corruption, poverty and the low status of women in which it would be applied. The Council is, however, in

favour of refunding some expenses, for example travel expenses, incurred in visiting a family planning

clinic. This would make services more accessible.

<p>

The Council recommends more support for research in order to broaden and improve the range of

contraceptives available. This applies particularly to research into male contraceptives. The Council also

recommends support for research into methods over which women have control, for example, a gel which

provides protection against HIV infection. Two forms are being developed: one provides protection only

against HIV and the other is also a contraceptive. The Council believes that research into immunological

vaccines for women is less desirable as there would be risks involved in their use and women would have

little control over such methods.

<p>

When population policy is formulated specific ways of giving greater power to the grassroots should be

sought. The Council is of the opinion that substance should be given to mechanisms for ensuring

participation in population programmes. The assistance of advisory or supervisory committees which

represent private organisations, NGOs and women's organisations in particular should be sought in

formulating and implementing programmes. Ways of evaluating participation should also be built into policy

programmes.

<p>

It is the Council's view that frank debate with the Roman Catholic church should take place on the

consequences of its doctrine on sexuality and contraception.

<p>

The Council would point to the common aspects in the approaches of environmental and women's

movements. These are clear if one examines critically the present patterns of development from a sustainable

development perspective. It is not possible to alter these patterns without changing the existing balance of

power and inequality. Survival strategies and the participation of the poor are central features of this type of

approach. Common strategy should be geared towards achieving political undertakings to spend more money

on a broad, integrated approach to population issues.

<p>

As far as the dialogue on population issues between the governments of the industrialised countries and the

developing countries of the South are concerned, the North should not evade its responsibility for sustainable

development. Unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the North are placing a

disproportionate burden on the world's resources. The population issue should not result in a new

conditionality being introduced into development relations, but in equal dialogue.

<p>

Two members of the Council, who are also members of the working group which prepared the report,

support most of the report but have different views on a number of points, under which are also included

the idea to actively propagate a broad and consistent strategy at the Cairo conference and the offer to

elaborate on the operationalisation of a broad population policy in a future recommendation. The most

important different views can be summarised as follows:

<ul>

<li>The most serious problem by far is still rapid population growth and problems such as urbanisation

and the aging of the population are merely extensions of the main problem. Attention should therefore be

devoted primarily to population growth.

<li>The recommended measures are therefore unlikely to succeed in alleviating the population problem.

While growth is still so rapid, all acceptable means should be deployed to reduce it, including providing

target groups with financial rewards to reduce fertility. This should be subject to certain safeguards.

<li>Clearer priorities should be set, particularly relating to the nature and extent of family planning

facilities and related information campaigns.

</ul>

<h2 align=center> WELCOME TO THE SAVVIEST PLACE IN HYPERSPACE</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>

     
     It is challenging. It might make you angry; it might change your mind. 
     You may
     even take action. Welcome to Hot Savvy 
     (http://www.oneworld.org/scf/youth),
     Save the Children's new website for young people, which is launched on 
     Monday
     16 December.<p>
     
     Are you aged between 11 and 20 and concerned about children's rights; 
     racism;
     famine; poverty; homelessness; pollution? If so, this internet site is 
     made for you.
     Hot Savvy is fully interactive, with plenty of ideas of how to put 
     your thoughts into
     action. You can also take part in surveys (the results are regularly 
     posted up), a
     voting page, and The Questionifier, aided by guides Savvy Sal and the 
     Duke of
     URL.<p>
     
     As well as being fun, the idea behind Hot Savvy is to encourage young 
     people to
     think about issues important to them - personal concerns as well as 
     their opinions
     on global issues. For example, the Voting Page asks browsers about 
     their top
     gripes: exams, boredom; jobs; Noel and Liam; money (or lack of); 
     family,
     relationships; school; drugs; appearance; police/law; place to live.<p>
     
     The pages can be used by individual surfers but are also ideal for 
     sparking
     discussions in youth groups and the classroom. Says Peter White, 
     author of the
     pages: <p>
     <blockquote>
          "Hot Savvy invites young people to think, it gives them ideas and 
     things to
          do - without ever taking itself too seriously. Hot Savvy is also 
     a great way
          to find out about the lifestyles of people in your own age group 
     who live
          thousands of miles away."                         </blockquote><p>
                                        
     <h4>NOTES FOR EDITORS:</h4>
     
     1. Save the Children's main website can be found on One World On-Line: 
     http://www.oneworld.org/scf, which gives information on current 
     projects, live
     issues, publications and ways to support Save the Children's work in 
     the UK and
     overseas.<p>
     
     2. Hot Savvy is the latest initiative from Save the Children's Youth 
     Education
     Programme. Its aim is to make children's rights a reality through 
     global education.
     The Programme also produces a range of publications for youth groups 
     including
     Right Angle (available from Save the Children's Education Unit, 0171 
     703 5400)
     and Spotlight which appears in the youth work magazine Young People 
     Now).<p>

Minister for Development Cooperation, J P Pronk, with a report on the norms and nature of the Netherlands

development cooperation.</b>

<p>

<h3>Summary</h3>



With this report, the NAR wishes to make a contribution to the current social and political discussion on

Netherlands development cooperation. The report contains the following propositions:

<ul>

<li>the current confusion regarding the nature of the Netherlands development effort and the norms

defining its extent - in that order - should be brought to an end as quickly as possible;

<li>the recently abandoned norm was in no way excessive, considering the problems, both old and new,

confronting developing countries;

<li>the problems currently facing developing countries need to be re-assessed in the light of recent

developments;

<li>there is an urgent need for a clear policy, particularly in the light of current public opinion in the

Netherlands - as perceived by the Council - regarding development cooperation.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Time for clarity</h3>



The NAR urges that a number of measures should be taken within the coming five years to address the

problems, both old and new, facing development policy. Aid to the poorest developing countries should be

increased, with less going to the richer ones. More scope should be created for assistance to Central and

Eastern Europe and to tackle environmental problems. With this new framework for aid established, the

norm for the Netherlands contribution should be set at a new level - 1.5% of NNI (Net National Income)

after the five-year period.

<p>

Furthermore, the Council urges that the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay round) be completed as

soon as possible and in such a way as to increase the export potential of developing countries. The Council

also believes that there is scope for drawing up regional trade agreements between the North and South.

<p>

Protection of the markets of the rich countries against the import of goods and the migration of labour from

developing countries restricts the development potential of these countries. The Council sees this as a further

reason for providing assistance, to compensate for these restrictions.

<p>

Discussion of new tasks in the areas of the environment, peace and security and aid to Central and Eastern

Europe should not be avoided. These issues are relevant to development cooperation and should, under

certain conditions,  be integrated into development policy.

<p>

In the interests of effectiveness and to prevent fragmentation, the Council advocates reducing the number of

countries (currently 54) which receive aid from the Netherlands. In addition, efforts aimed at structural

poverty alleviation should be concentrated in the 37 poorest countries with which the Netherlands already

has a development relationship. Expansion of the programme to countries in Central and Eastern Europe

will make further streamlining  necessary.

<p>

<h3>Stop the political erosion of development cooperation</h3>



The NAR is optimistic regarding the extent of public support for development cooperation in the Nether-

lands. It laments the erosion of development policy at the political level and the emergence of a political

decision-making process which is both unclear and out of line with the intentions and preferences of a large

part of the Netherlands population. The "contamination" of the budget, which has increased considerably

since 1989, should be rectified within a specified period to allow scope for the proposed new policy.

<p>

<h3>Measures</h3>



Given the current situation, the Council recommends that the government undertake the following action

during the coming five years:

<ol>

<li>Official Development Assistance (ODA): The first priority should be to increase ODA to developing

countries through multilateral and bilateral programmes (including those of the Co-Financing Organisations)

from its current level of 0.78% to 1,0% of GNP in the 1998 budget. The table below indicates how the

development budget should be allocated:

</TR>

</TABLE>





<p>

<li>'Purification' of the budget: A clearer picture should be given of the expenditure that should, now or

in the future, be included in the aid budget. A number of the items that are currently covered by the budget

(see annex 3) should be removed. These include the costs of accommodating asylum-seekers, the

contribution to the Ministry of Education and Science and a number of others which are in no way related to

the interests of developing countries. The first two items mentioned account for 36% of the non-ODA part

of the 1993 development budget (NLG 497.7m of a total of NLG 1,385m). The total non-ODA part of the

budget is 0.24% of GNP or 0.31% of NNI. This purification should be effected within a specified period

(for example, five years);

<p>

<li>Choice of countries: In the interests of efficiency, the criteria for countries eligible for development

assistance from the Netherlands should be tightened up. In respect of the ODA contribution, at least 80%

should be allocated to countries with a per capita income of US$ 650 or less and no ODA should be

allocated to countries with a per capita income higher than US$ 1,235 (1991 levels). Countries falling

between these two limits may be eligible for concessional loans on ODA terms in exceptional circumstances;

<p>

<li>New countries: Aid to countries in Central and Eastern Europe will automatically be categorised as

ODA when they qualify for the DAC list and if the aid is sufficiently concessional. This assistance should

be provided from regular development funds, as far as this is made possible by reducing the contamination

of the budget. If this proves insufficient, additional funds will have to be released;

<p>

<li>Environmental expenditure: Contributions that are made by the Netherlands through bilateral and

multilateral (e.g. GEF) channels to help developing countries on the DAC list comply with international

environmental agreements will automatically be considered ODA by the DAC. This assistance should be

provided from regular development funds, as far as this is made possible by reducing the contamination of

the budget. If this proves insufficient, additional funds will have to be released;

<p>

<li>Separation of expenditure: Certain items that fall under the development budget which are relevant to

developing countries but are not ODA as defined by the DAC should be given a ceiling. This expenditure

includes such items as administrative expenses, certain interest subsidies, etc. It is recommended that a

ceiling of 0.14% of GNP be imposed on these items within a period of five years;

<p>

<li>Security: Development funds should not be used to put an end to armed conflict but to provide

humanitarian aid and support for reconstruction once conflicts have been resolved. Assessment of defence

spending by developing countries and subsequent policy should as far as possible follow the criteria drawn

up jointly by donors. Support for the setting up of democratic institutions at both national and local level and

including institutions to guarantee access to reliable legal procedures should be given high priority.

</ol>

<p>

"It would be a miracle if we succeed, functioning as we do". These words were used by Jawaharlal Nehru

when he presented India's first Five-Year Plan. The NAR believes that international problems in the areas

of security, poverty and the environment will increase in both size and intensity during the coming decade,

demanding a greater international effort and greater sacrifices from the industrialised countries. As a

development partner and in its role as international defender of the interests of developing countries and the

poor that inhabit them, the Netherlands should reaffirm that it is able to provide an appropriate and reliable

contribution to the solution of these issues. Where possible the Netherlands should strive to attain a higher

norm - two per cent of NNI is not an excessive target.

<title>Tintin returns to the Congo</title>

Tintin returns to the Congo:<br>Belgium wishes to resume

its influence in Central Africa</h2>

<h4>by <i>Jos van Beurden</i>

<p>

Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly

magazine on development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol

29, No. 5, 1995: page 11</h4>

</center>

<hr>

<b>In recent years the Belgian presence has been

increasingly less evident in Africa. But the Secretary of

State for Development Cooperation, Reginald Moreels, wishes

to change this. And policy has been drawn up with this in

mind. But the aid budget also needs to see a dramatic

increase in the years to come.</b>

<p>

There was a time when Belgium had considerable economic

interest in Africa. But this now has the air of something

from a past era. Africa has practically ceased to play any

part in Belgian business. Only 1.22 percent of the entire

Belgian export goes to Sub-Saharan Africa, while 2.53

percent of imports come from the continent. The interests

of the Belgian business community have shifted in favour of

countries such as Vietnam or Indonesia.

<p>

The Belgian military presence in Africa has also faded. The

Military-Technological Cooperation Agreement with Burundi

was terminated way back in 1972 following massacres

perpetrated by the Burundian army. The agreement with Za&iuml;re

came to an end in June of 1990 following the blood bath in

May at the University of Lubumbashi. The agreement with

Rwanda was suspended in April of 1994 following the Belgian

withdrawal. "From a military point of view, France has

taken over the Belgian position," explains Jean-Claude

Willame, formerly a Professor in Za&iuml;re and now employed for

many years at the African Study and Documentation Centre in

Brussels. "The French presence in former Belgian Africa

continues to give rise to resentment." If Belgium now also

chooses to intervene from the airport of Zaventen, the

paratroopers will arrive no later than 24 hours after their

French colleagues.

<p>

Development aid dropped. Of all the bilateral aid given

between the years of 1970 and 1990, two-thirds went to

former colonies with intense concentration on Za&iuml;re. After

the break with Za&iuml;re, that share fell considerably. Up to

that point, what Africa policy there was was geared towards

maintaining the Mobutu regime.

<p>

"Unlike France, for a long time Belgium had no African

policy at all. The Congo was never a Belgian colony," says

Willame. "It was the colony of a few Belgian individuals:

King Leopold II, the Miners Union, the General Company (La

Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale) and a handful of adventurers. There

exists in Belgium no African debate which can be compared

with the bickering in the Netherlands over Indonesia and

Surinam. At one point Minister Tindemans of Foreign Affairs

presented a memorandum on African Policy, only ten members

of parliament showed any interest."

<p>

The Dehaene Cabinet wants to change all this. It refuses to

restrict African policy to evacuation orders for Belgian

citizens in situations of crisis. At the beginning of this

year there appeared: Belgium and Sub-Saharan Africa: Agenda

for a new Dialogue and new Cooperation. On 12 October 1995

the general policy document was issued by the brand-new

Secretary of State for Development Cooperation, Reginald

Moreels. Until recently Moreels was director of the Belgian

section of Doctors without Borders.

<p>

"Belgian policy documents are different from Dutch policy

documents," observes Belgian development expert Geert

Laporte. "They are shorter, possibly less profound, but

certainly not less clear. And when it comes to

implementation we are equally as good. Our ambitions are

more modest, more sober and less idealistic." This

conclusion also applies to the two documents referred to.

Both testify to a rupture. In retrospect, aid, intervention

and pressure have not led to sustainable development, good

management nor to the constitutional state. Thus something

other is required. In place of the massive efforts of

Belgian development workers, there is now a call for

Africa's endemic capacity to be developed. The traditional

project managers have to make way for strategic, long-term

thinkers both in Belgium and in the recipient countries.

Bilateral aid no longer goes solely to national

governments. Local authorities and non-governmental

organizations are also in the running. Paternalism is

making way for partnership.

<p>

Nice words, no doubt. The motives behind the new policy are

also nicely packaged: the permanent pressure of migration

by Africans, people that Europe is unable to accommodate,

and who simultaneously deprive Africa of its most important

capital, and the threat of armed conflict which needs to be

stemmed. Peace is a fundamental condition for sustainable

development. However, it would also appear that the new

opportunities for the Belgian business community are

certainly no less important. The Belgian business community

is betting on the fact that standardization will press

ahead rapidly in Za&iuml;re. It wants to start work again in the

diamond mining in Za&iuml;re. Not only that, the scent of

opportunity is also in the air in South Africa. For

Flanders South Africa is even a focus country.

<p>

Belgium is keen to regain the influence in Central Africa

that it relinquished to the French and to once again assume

the role of a driving force. The official bilateral aid to

Za&iuml;re has not yet been resumed, but considerably more money

is to be made available for Non-Governmental Organizations

(NGOs) in healthcare and education. Immediately after

presenting his memorandum, Secretary of State Moreels flew

to Rwanda - with the highly esteemed journalist Els de

Temmerman as advisor, she will hold the post for a year in

order to discuss the return of refugees and the Rwanda

Tribunal.

<p>

Host to and very much a member of the European Union, the

Belgians see an important role for the Organization for

African Unity. It is the African troops rather than the

French which must take over the work of the Belgians.

Brussels is even ready to assume the role of godparent to

the African intervention units. Much to his dismay,

Reginald Moreels will have to make do with 0.32 percent of

the Gross Domestic Product for the time being, even if he

writes that this is to be increased to 0.7 of the GDP by

the year 2000. As the director of Doctors without Borders,

Moreels called for a Minister for Development Cooperation.

For now he has had to make do with a Secretary of State.

<h2>Silencing the Net - Summary</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Governments around the world, claiming they want to protect children, thwart terrorists and silence racists and hate mongers, are rushing to eradicate freedom of expression on the Internet, the international &quot;network of networks,&quot; touted as the Information Superhighway. It is particularly crucial now, in the early stages of vast technological change, that governments reaffirm their commitment to respect the rights of citizens to communicate freely. A G7 Ministerial Conference on the Information Society and Development to be held in South Africa from May 13-15, 1996 should be used as a platform to repudiate the international trend toward censorship and to express unequivocal support for free expression guarantees on-line.</P>
<P>Restrictions on Internet access and content are increasing worldwide, under all forms of government. Censorship legislation was recently enacted in the United States, the birthplace of the Bill of Rights as well as of this new communications medium and, for better or worse, a model for other nations' Internet policies. The Clinton administration claims the law will protect minors from &quot;indecent&quot; material and appears unconcerned that it will reduce on-line expression between adults to what may be deemed suitable for a child. Other democratic countries are following suit. The German phone company cut off access to all the sites hosted by an American Internet service provider (ISP) in an effort to bar Germans from gaining access to neo-Nazi propaganda on one of the sites it hosted. The governments of France and Australia have also indicated they may enact legislation to control Internet content.</P>
<P>Authoritarian regimes are attempting to reconcile their eagerness to reap the economic benefits of Internet access with maintaining control over the flow of information inside their borders. Censorship efforts in the U.S. and Germany lend support to those in China, Singapore, and Iran, where censors target not only sexually explicit material and hate speech but also pro-democracy discussions and human rights education. Proposals to censor the Internet wherever they originate violate the free speech guarantees enshrined in democratic constitutions and international law. In the attempt to enforce them, open societies will become increasingly repressive and closed societies will find new opportunity to chill political expression. </P>
<P>Because the Internet knows no national boundaries, on-line censorship laws, in addition to trampling on the free expression rights of a nation's own citizens, threaten to chill expression globally and to impede the development of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) before it becomes a truly global phenomenon. Democratic countries, including the U.S. and Germany, that are pushing for the development of the GII will lack legitimacy in criticizing efforts by China to eliminate information that &quot;hinders public order&quot; or by Vietnam, where the &quot;the cultural aspect&quot; is cited as a reason to censor connections to pro-democracy discussions abroad. <B>1</B> <font size=2>(According to Nghiem Yuan Tinh, deputy director of Vietnam Data Communication Company, &quot;The Internet must be controlled, not only for technical and security reasons but from the cultural aspect.&quot; &quot;Plan by Telecom Authorityto Exercise Control Over Internet Disturbs Foreign Investors and Agency,&quot; Financial Times (London), September 19, 1995.)</font></P>
<P>An issue closely related to censorship is that of access, which is to a large extent determined by the existing telecommunications system. According to a 1995 report by the Panos Institute, a London-based international non-profit organization specializing in development issues, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Access requires a telephone line. Forty-nine countries have fewer than one telephone per 100 people, 35 of which are in Africa. India, for example, has 8 million telephone lines for 900 million people. At a global level at least 80% of the world's population still lacks the most basic telecommunications. <B>2</B> <font size=2>(The Internet and the South: Superhighway or Dirt-Track? (London: Panos Institute, 1995).)</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Opportunities to promote access have never been greater, however. New communications technologies are providing developing countries with an unprecedented means to leapfrog antiquated communication networks. </P>
<P>Limits on access are imposed by governments for a variety of reasons, including economic gain and political control. Some governments, including India and Saudi Arabia, have chosen to control the liberalizing effect of the Internet by denying access to entire segments of their populations, either through exorbitant charges or by confining access to select populations, such as universities. Rather than attempting to extend the Internet to a diverse group of citizens, these governments are striving to reap the economic benefits of Internet access without making it available to economically, socially, and politically disadvantaged groups, for whom it has the greatest potential for positive change. In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, individuals who have Internet connections through foreign-owned corporations are able to elude these restrictions. </P>
<P>Even at this relatively early stage in the Internet's development, a wide range of restrictions on on-line communication have been put in place in at least twenty countries, including the following: </P>

<UL>
<LI>China, which requires users and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to register with authorities;
<LI>Vietnam and Saudi Arabia, which permit only a single, government-controlled gateway for Internet service;
<LI>United States, which has enacted new Internet-specific legislation that imposes more restrictive regulations on electronic expression than those currently applied to printed expression;
<LI>India, which charges exorbitant rates for international access through the state-owned phone company;
<LI>Germany, which has cut off access to particular host computers or Internet sites;
<LI>Singapore, which has chosen to regulate the Internet as if it were a broadcast medium, and requires political and religious content providers to register with the state; and
<LI>New Zealand, which classifies computer disks as publications and has seized and restricted them accordingly.
</UL>

<P>Privacy issues are closely related to the regulation of content and access. On-line communications are particularly susceptible to unauthorized scrutiny. Encryption technology is needed to ensure that individuals and groups may communicate without fear of eavesdropping. Lack of information privacy will inhibit on-line speech and unnecessarily limit the diversity of voices on the GII.</P>
<P>The Internet has the potential to be a tremendous force for development by providing quick and inexpensive information, by encouraging discussion rather than violence, and by empowering citizens, to cite but a few examples. But this potential can be realized only if it becomes a truly global effort. Policy makers must make every effort to ensure that internationally guaranteed rights to free expression are extended to on-line communication and call for the repeal of censorship legislation. Without such commitments, individuals face the danger of seeing their rights eroded by the very technologies they are embracing. </P>
<P>This report recommends principles for international and regional bodies and nations to follow when formulating public policy and laws affecting the Internet, sets forth the international legal principles governing on-line expression, and, finally, examines some of the current attempts around the globe to censor on-line communication.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The meeting of the G7 countries (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States) in South Africa in May 1996 to discuss the development of the GII should be used as one platform to emphasize the importance of freedom of expression. <B>3</B> <font size=2>(A UNESCO meeting was held in Madrid in March 1996 to discuss copyright protection on the Internet. To our knowledge, that conference represented the only U.N.-sponsored effort to address Internet regulation.)</font> Regional agreements should clearly state that freedom of expression principles apply to electronic communication. These agreements should clarify that the Internet differs significantly from broadcast media in areas such as the level of choice and control afforded to the individual user. Because of such distinctions, it is important that the Internet not be subject to the same restrictions as are often imposed on broadcast media.</P>
<P>It is important to promote the universal application of two important free expression principles not yet codified in international law. The first of these is an explicit prohibition against prior censorship, that is, requiring official approval of communication before making it public. Such a practice has been used by repressive governments against the press and could be invoked against electronic communication. The second is an explicit prohibition against restrictions of free expression by indirect methods, such as the abuse of controls over equipment or broadcasting frequencies used in the dissemination of information; or by any other means tending to impede the communication and circulation of ideas and opinions. Controls over newsprint have frequently been used to silence critical publications. Governments are already modernizing their techniques to include modem lines and international Internet connections.</P>
<P>In its February 1995 letter to U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the eve of the G7 Ministerial Conference on the Information Society, Human Rights Watch joined with a number of other organizations in proposing the following principles regarding content, access, and privacy. <B>4</B> <font size=2>(The American Library Association, American Civil Liberties Union, Article 19, Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic Frontiers Foundation, Electronic Privacy Information Center, People for the American Way, Privacy International also signed the letter.)</font> These principles are even more critical today, and we urge policy makers at the G7 conference in South Africa, and the framers of GII policy within other regional bodies and international organizations, to follow them.</P>

<H3>Content Issues</H3>
<P>Policy makers should take the initiative to expressly enshrine freedom of expression as a principle in the development of the GII. This should include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Prohibiting prior censorship of on-line communication on the GII.
<LI>Demanding that any restrictions of on-line speech content beclearly stated in the law and limited to direct and immediate incitement of acts of violence.
<LI>Requiring that laws restricting the content of on-line speech distinguish between the liability of content providers and the liability of data carriers.
<LI>Insisting that on-line free expression not be restricted by indirect means such as excessively restrictive governmental or private controls over computer hardware or software, telecommunications infrastructure, or other essential components of the GII.
<LI>Calling for the promotion of non-commercial public discourse on the GII.
<LI>Promoting the wide dissemination of diverse ideas and viewpoints from a wide variety of information sources on the GII.
<LI>Ensuring that the GII enable individuals to organize and form on-line associations freely and without interference.
</UL>

<H3>Access Issues</H3>
<P>GII policy should emphasize the importance of providing Internet access to everyone, regardless of geographic or other factors. This should encompass:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Including citizens in the GII development process from countries that are currently unstable economically, have insufficient infrastructure, or lack sophisticated technology.
<LI>Providing non-discriminatory access to on-line technology.
<LI>Guaranteeing a full range of viewpoints, by providing access to a diversity of information providers, including non-commercial educational, artistic, and other public interest service providers.
<LI>Providing two-way communication and enabling individuals to publish their own information and ideas.
<LI>Protecting diversity of access by establishing technical standards that can be applied easily in a variety of systems.
<LI>Prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
</UL>

<H3>Privacy Issues</H3>
<P>Delegates to the G7 meeting and other meetings concerning policy on the GII should guarantee respect for the privacy of communication on the Internet by:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Ensuring that personal information generated on the GII for one purpose is not used for an unrelated purpose or disclosed without the person's informed consent.
<LI>Enabling individuals to review personal information on the GII and to correct inaccurate information.
<LI>Providing privacy measures for information regarding on-line business transactions as well as content.
<LI>Allowing users of the GII to encrypt their communications and information without restriction.
</UL>

<P>The above recommendations are also pertinent to individual governments in shaping their own policies with respect to on-line communication. In addition, the following recommendations apply to domestic Internet policies:</P>

<UL>
<LI>To ensure that domestic Internet services are designed to ensure universal access, governments should provide full disclosure of information infrastructure development plans and encourage democratic participation in all aspects of the development process. They should also advocate widespread use of the GII and strive to provide adequate training. In addition, governments should urge citizens to take an active role in public affairs by providing access to government information.
<LI>In order to guarantee the privacy of on-line communication, governments should put in place enforceable legal protections against unauthorized scrutiny and use by private or public entities of personal information on the GII. They should also oppose controls on the export and import of communications technologies, including encryption. In addition, governments should conduct investigations on the GII pursuant only to lawful authority and subject to judicial review.

<h2>Silencing the Net - Background</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Internet began in the 1960s as a way of linking a U.S. Defense Department network and other communications networks. Over time, many other networks and users from around the world have connected themselves to the Internet. The U.S. still dominates the Internet in terms of users and content, but Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are also on-line in large numbers. Internet usage in much of Asia is increasing rapidly as well. The number of Internet users is believed to range between twenty and thirty million. More than 160 countries are reported to have links to the Internet, over one hundred nations with full access and the rest through e-mail. <B>5</B> <font size=2>(Johanna Son, &quot;Asia-Communication: Bumps Lie Ahead in Information Superhighway,&quot; Inter Press Service, December 14, 1995.)</font> </P>
<P>The Internet is composed of a number of different ways of organizing, transmitting and accessing data. Because of this multiplicity of systems, it is unlike any other single medium. Rather, it incorporates characteristics of several other media and communications systems, including print, broadcast, and postal systems. Electronic mail (e-mail) allows for one-to-one or one-to-many communication. Gopher sites provide text-only information arranged according to menus. The World Wide Web allows for the display of many types of information, including text, images, sound and video, as well as interactive communication.</P>
<P>A recognition by world leaders of the need to formulate policy for this powerful new medium prompted members of the G7 to hold a &quot;Ministerial Conference on the Information Society&quot; in Brussels in February 1995. At that conference, a number of principles were agreed to, including encouraging competition and private investment, defining an adaptable regulatory framework, providing open access to networks, ensuring universal access, and promoting equality of opportunity and diversity of content. Although freedom of expression was not highlighted in specific terms, to the disappointment of Human Rights Watch and other groups that had urged such an emphasis, it is implied in the final goal promoting diversity of content which can be achieved only by encouraging free expression for people all over the world. <B>6</B> <font size=2>(Letter to Vice President Gore from Human Rights Watch, Electronic Privacy Information Center, ACLU, American Library Association, Article 19, Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic Frontiers Foundation, People for the American Way, and Privacy International, February 16, 1995.)</font> In his keynote address to the conference, Vice President Gore, an active proponent of the GII, stated, &quot;[Global communication] is about protecting and enlarging freedom of expression for all our citizens and giving individual citizens the power to create the information they need and want from the abundant flow of data they encounter moment to moment.&quot;</P>
<P>One of the main targets of the censors is Usenet, a system separate from the Internet but accessible from it, that &quot;pump[s] upwards of 100 million characters a day into the system - nearly an encyclopedia's worth of writing.&quot; <B>7</B> <font size=2>(Adam Gaffin, EFF Guide to the Internet (San Francisco: Electronic Frontiers Foundation,Revised December 4, 1995).)</font> Usenet comprises more than 9,000 &quot;newsgroups&quot; discussions or picture databases on various topics, including the political and the sexually explicit. The groups are arranged under headings such as biz (business), comp (computers and related subjects), rec (hobbies, games and recreation), sci (science), soc (&quot;social&quot; groups, often ethnically related), talk (politics and related topics), and alt (for alternative, often controversial). Not all the newsgroups are available on all Internet host computers. Usenet came to prominent international attention most recently in late December 1995, when CompuServe, an on-line service of H&amp;R Block, based in Columbus, Ohio, removed from all of its computers more than 200 Usenet computer discussion groups and picture databases that had provoked criticism by a federal prosecutor in Munich. <B>8</B> <font size=2>(The &quot;banned&quot; newsgroups were still available to CompuServe users who used the service to connect to computers that carried the newsgroups. Information on how to do this circulated quickly through the CompuServe system.)</font> Three days later, the Chinese government echoed the Germans' actions by calling for a crackdown on the Internet to rid the country of pornography and &quot;detrimental information.&quot; <B>9</B> <font size=2>(&quot;China Cracks Down on Internet,&quot; Deutche Presse Agentur, January 1, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>It should not be surprising that governments around the globe are anxious to control this new medium. Every communications advance in history has been seen by self-appointed moral guardians as something to be controlled and regulated. By 1558, a century after the invention of the printing press, a Papal index barred the works of more than 500 authors. In 1915, the same year that the D. W. Griffith film &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; changed the U.S. cultural landscape, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an Ohio state censorship board created two years earlier, thus exempting motion pictures from free speech protection on the grounds that their exhibition &quot;is a business, pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit....&quot; The same view was applied in the early days of radio entertainment programs were thought to be exempt from freedom of speech guarantees.</P>
<P>The Internet, as the first truly &quot;mass&quot; medium, is even more threatening than these earlier media. While few individuals and groups can publish books or newspapers, make a film, or produce a radio or television program, any person with a personal computer and a modem can communicate with a huge international audience. The implications of a real GII for the advancement of human rights and democracy are vast. When traditional means of communication broke down and the war in Sarajevo made it impossible for civilians to leave their homes without risking their lives, many citizens used on-line technology to communicate with family members, the international press, and humanitarian relief agencies. Human rights groups, political organizations, and builders of burgeoning democracies are using the Internet to communicate, educate, and organize. During the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, women all over the world were able to feel a sense of participation because of regular postings on the proceedings. It is precisely because of the Internet's potential for increasing the political participation of the disenfranchised that governments are seekingto control it.</P>
<P>These initial achievements could easily disappear if the censors are allowed to have their way. Governments and other institutions that support freedom of expression must ensure that the Internet is granted the same guarantees that are given to other forms of individual expression. International law is clear on what electronic rights of expression must entail. Although international law does not address such communication specifically, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enshrine rights to freedom of expression, access, and privacy, which are relevant to the new medium. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. <B>10</B> <font size=2>(Other relevant articles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights include the following: &quot;Article 7: All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law; Article 12: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence; Article 27: Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.)</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees this right as well, and notes that restrictions on this right &quot;shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.&quot; <B>11</B> <font size=2>(Other relevant articles from the ICCPR include the following: Article 25 guarantees the right &quot;to take part in the conduct of public affairs;&quot; Article 26 states: &quot;All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law....[T]he law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.&quot;)</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The recently adopted Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information <B>12</B> <font size=2>(These Principles were adopted on October 1, 1995 by a group of experts in international law, national security, and human rights.)</font> state that restrictions on freedom of expression are permitted only when &quot;the government can demonstrate that the restriction is prescribed by law and is necessary in a democratic society to protect a legitimate national security interest.&quot; <B>13</B> <font size=2>(For the purposes of the Principles, &quot;a democratic society is one which has a government that is genuinely accountable to an entity or organ distinct from itself; there must be genuine, periodicelections by universal and equal suffrage held by secret ballot that guarantee the free expression of the will of the electors; political groups must be free to organize in opposition to the government in office; and there must be effective legal guarantees of fundamental rights enforced by an independent judiciary.&quot;)</font> According to the Principles, the burden of demonstrating the validity of the restriction rests with the government. <B>14</B> <font size=2>(Principle 1(c).)</font> Criticism of the government or its leaders is protected. <B>15</B> <font size=2>(Principle 7.)</font> In addition, a government must demonstrate that &quot;the restriction imposed is the least restrictive means possible for protecting that interest.&quot; <B>16</B> <font size=2>(Principle 1.3(b).)</font></P>

<h2>Silencing the Net - North America</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><p><H3>United States</H3>
<P>Hysteria about &quot;cyberporn&quot; was ignited in the U.S. after Time magazine published a cover story, complete with lurid photographs, asserting the wide availability of sexually explicit material on the Internet. <B>17</B> <font size=2>(Philip Elmer-Dewitt, &quot;On a Screen Near You: It's Popular, Pervasive and Surprisingly Perverse, According to the First Survey of On-line Erotica. And There's No Easy Way To Stamp It Out,&quot; Time, July 3, 1995.)</font> The article was based on the research findings (later acknowledged by Time to have been seriously flawed) of a student at Carnegie Mellon University. Nevertheless, this concern recently culminated in the enactment of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), an amendment to a sweeping telecommunications reform bill signed in February 1996.</P>
<P>The CDA criminalizes on-line communication that is &quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass an other person&quot; or &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; if the recipient of the communication is under eighteen years of age &quot;regardless of whether the maker of such communication placed the call or initiated the communication.&quot; Also prohibited is on-line communication to minors that &quot;depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the communication.&quot; <B>18</B> <font size=2>(U.S. Code, Title V, Subsection A, Section 502 &quot;Obscene or Harassing Use of Telecommunications Facilities Under the Communications Act of 1934.&quot; )</font> The CDA would permit the U.S., for example, to seek the arrest of a European content provider whose sexually explicit material was seen as &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive.&quot; </P>
<P>In letters to members of Congress and President Clinton, Human Rights Watch opposed the CDA, taking the position that &quot;indecent&quot; speech is protected by both the U.S. Constitution and international law. Human Rights Watch is also concerned that the effort to censor &quot;indecent&quot; communication could impede the work of our own and similar organizations which transmit graphic accounts of human rights abuses. Because of these concerns, in February, Human Rights Watch became a plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the CDA on constitutional grounds. The suit is currently before a panel of judges. According to our affidavit, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some of the accounts [of abuses in Human Rights Watch reports] are necessarily graphic and explicit: torture, rape, mutilation, execution, mass murder are brutalities that must be discussed in detail if people are to understand the widespread human rights abuses occurring worldwide. Likewise, to address human rights abuses without discussing the violence of acts such as rape, torture, and bodily mutilation would be impossible. Human Rights Watch exposes the abuse in order to educate the public about the scope of current abuse and to prevent future atrocities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he graphic nature of some of the eyewitness accounts,especially those dealing with sexual assault, may be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot; under this statute. For example, our July 1995 press release on slavery in Pakistan, posted at our gopher site [on the Internet], provides graphic and factual details on the ways in which bonded laborers have been tortured. The text relates that they have been &quot;beaten with sticks, stripped naked, hung upside down, burned with cigarettes, beaten on the genitals and have had their legs pulled apart. Women prisoners are often held in custody indefinitely and suffer a consistent pattern of sexual assault, including rape.&quot; A March 1995 press release on abuses by Nigerian security forces in Ogoniland, posted at our gopher site, quotes the testimony of one woman, as follows: &quot;K, a woman in her late thirties from the village of Bera, told Human Rights Watch that she had been raped by five soldiers in rapid succession on the morning of May 28, 1994. After locking K's 10-year-old son in a room, K recalled,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><b>..the soldiers beat me with the butts of their guns, pushed me onto the ground, and kicked me. They tore off my wrapper, then my underwear. Two of them raped me through my anus, three the usual way. While one soldier raped me, another would beat me. I tried to scream, but they held my mouth. They said if I made too much noise they would kill me.</b></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our October 1993 report on the abuse of Burmese refugees from Arakan, posted on the newsgroup reg.seasia, relates abuses against women in language such as, &quot;then the official grabbed her breast&quot; (p. 12); &quot;the CIC and the other official put their hands inside S.K.'s clothing and touched her all over her body, including her vagina&quot; (p. 13); &quot;...one policeman fondled S.K.'s breasts and struck S.K. on the back of then neck with a stick&quot; (p. 13).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Clearly, obstacles to Human Rights Watch in reporting these atrocities in the United States are likely to be magnified for groups operating in more repressive states and attempting to post similar findings on the Internet.</P>
<H3>Canada</H3>
<P>In response to the debate about cyberspace, the Canadian government formed the Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) in 1994 to study and prepare an official statement on what directions the Internet should take in Canada. In September 1995, the council released its first report, which contained only vague recommendations. On the issue of content, it concluded that there should be controls on two primary targets: obscenity and racist/hate material. <B>19</B> <font size=2>(Alana Kainz, &quot;Information Highway: Advisory report leaves uncharted roads,&quot; Ottawa Citizen, September 28, 1995.)</font><p>
It is illegal to spread &quot;hate propaganda&quot; and &quot;obscenity&quot; in Canada. Sexually explicit material is legal as long as it is not deemed obscene, that is, characterized by &quot;undue exploitation of sex,&quot; meaning sex plus violence or degrading sex. Under a new law on child pornography that has not been tested by the Supreme Court, mere possession is illegal. According to David Jones, president of Electronic Frontiers Canada, &quot;There are no new laws being proposed that apply specifically to the Internet.&quot; <B>20</B> <font size=2>(E-mail correspondence from Dr.David Jones to Human Rights Watch, February 15, 1996.)</font> <p>
That could change, however. On April 2, 1996, Justice Minister Allan Rock released a discussion paper inviting Canadians to present their views on regulating excessive violence in the media, including the Internet. <B>21</B> <font size=2>(David Vienneau, &quot;Rock seeks views on violence,&quot; Toronto Star, April 3, 1996.)</font><p>

<h2>Silencing the Net - Asia</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Asia now has over 1.5 million users, two thirds of them in Japan. <B>22</B> <font size=2>(Johanna Son, &quot;Asia-Communication: Bumps Lie Ahead in Information Superhighway,&quot; Inter Press Service, December 14, 1995.)</font> Among the region's authoritarian nations, only North Korea and Myanmar are without any Internet connection. <B>23</B> <font size=2>(Philip Shenon, &quot;Why Nations Fear the Net,&quot; New York Times, June 11, 1995.)</font> Currently, most countries in Asia are connected directly to the U.S., rather than to each other, but new initiatives have proposed establishing an intra-Asia connection.</P>
<P>Some Asian governments, including Pakistan, are choosing to control the Internet's effects mainly by limiting its availability. A senior scientist at Pakistan's state-owned National Institute of Electronics has noted that Internet access would be limited by the small number of nodes and hosts available to users and by the intervention of service providers who could stop undesirable discussion groups and electronic messages. <B>24</B> <font size=2>(Ajoy Sen, &quot;Some Asian Nations Give Internet Mixed Reception,&quot; Reuters, June 13, 1995.)</font> In India, where commercial Internet access was launched in mid-1995, only the state-owned phone company, VSNL, has been allowed to provide international Internet services, in order to maintain the government's monopoly on long-distance phone services. <B>25</B> <font size=2>(Spaeth, Anthony, &quot; National Security,' the Vietnamese Government Wants to Control Internet Access,&quot; Time, October 16, 1995.)</font> According to guidelines issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) based on the antiquated Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, an ISP must ensure that nothing objectionable or obscene is carried on the network, but it is not clear that these have been enforced. In late January 1996, the DoT decided to allow commercial access, but all companies will have to route their services through VSNL. <B>26</B> <font size=2>(C. T. Mahabharat, &quot;VSNL Monopoly on Internet Access to End,&quot; Newsbytes News Network (Stillwater, Minnesota), March 1, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>Thailand's National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (Nectec), an official agency responsible for information technology policy, recently called upon local ISPs to police their own sites for sexually explicit material. It also said that subscribers and operators are required to agree not to show anything considered indecent or they will face criminal prosecution. <B>27</B> <font size=2>(Nigel Armstrong and I.T. Daily, &quot;Thai Group on Porn Trail,&quot; Newsbytes News Network, February 26, 1996.)</font> In the Philippines, Internet censorship measures have been introduced in the legislature. <B>28</B> <font size=2>(Ninez Cacho-Olivares, &quot;My Cup of Tea Pornography on the Net,&quot; Business World (Manilla), March 18, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>In early March 1996, member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) said they planned to set up a regulatory body to deal with the flood of information technology; they also voiced concern about pornography and disinformation. <B>29</B> <font size=2>(Ramthan Hussein, &quot;Singapore Deputy Premier Defends Curbs on Internet,&quot; Reuters, March 9, 1996.)</font></P>
<H3>China</H3>
<P>Commercial Internet accounts became available in China in mid1995, but at prices far beyond the means of all but the wealthiest. In June 1995, China's telecommunications minister stated that &quot;as a sovereign state, China will exercise control on the information&quot; entering China from the Internet. &quot;By linking with the Internet, we do not mean the absolute freedom of information.&quot; <B>30</B> <font size=2>(Teresa Poole, &quot;China seeks to make the Internet toe party line,&quot; The Independent (London), January 5, 1996.)</font> Many Usenet newsgroups, including those classified as alt, rec and soc, were reportedly not allowed on Chinese Internet host computers, but the comp and sci hierarchies were apparently provided. <B>31</B> <font size=2>(E-mail from Peng Hwa Ang, Singapore, to Human Rights Watch, November 1995.)</font></P>
<P>The Hong Kong-based China Internet Corporation (CIC), principally owned by China's state-run Xinhua News Agency, offers Chinese business subscribers only limited access to business-related information. Users have access to information generated outside China, but only after it has been screened in Hong Kong. According to James Chu, CEO of CIC, customers can be assured their e-mail will not be screened or bugged by mainland &quot;unless you have broken the law.&quot; <B>32</B> <font size=2>(Rhonda Lam Wan, &quot;Xinhua Affiliate to Offer E-mail,&quot; South China Morning Post (Hong Kong), October 6, 1995.)</font></P>
<P>ChinaNet, based in Beijing and Shanghai, which became available in May 1995, provided commercial Internet access. Control of Internet access accounts was extremely tight, and people wishing to open them were required to register at the Postal Ministry. Fairly quickly, black market permits became available. <B>33</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Net Spreads a Web of Uncertainty,&quot; South China Morning Post, December 14, 1995.)</font></P>
<P>On January 1, 1996, several days after CompuServe cut off access to 200 Usenet newsgroups, Xinhua News Agency, China's official medium, reported that the government had called for a crackdown on the Internet to rid the country of unwanted pornography and &quot;detrimental information.&quot; <B>34</B> A joint statement issued by the State Council and the Communist Party Central Committee said effective measures had to be adopted to solve the problem of uncontrolled information. The leadership also reportedly summoned the Chinese suppliers of Internet connections, and on January 15, the biggest supplier announced a &quot;moratorium&quot; on new subscribers. <B>35</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Economic News A Blackout,&quot; The Economist (London), January 20, 1996.)</font> According to press reports, officials said that as many as 70,000 people were using the Internet through 7,000 accounts, and that the high volume was more than the current system could handle. <B>36</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Jammed Capacity Halts Sale of Internet Accounts,&quot; Economist Intelligence Unit (London), February 8, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>On January 23, a cabinet session chaired by Premier Li Peng adopted draft rules governing links to the Internet. The cabinet reiterated its provisional approval for global computer links but declared it &quot;imperative&quot; to formulate rules to govern China's use of the new technology. <B>37</B> <font size=2>(Paul Eckert, &quot;Britain Raises Concerns About China Media Measures,&quot; Reuters, January 24, 1996.)</font> OnFebruary 4, Xinhua announced that the new Internet regulations required existing computer networks to &quot;liquidate&quot; and &quot;re- register,&quot; and to use only international channels provided by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Electronics Industry, the State Education Commission and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. <B>38</B> <font size=2>(Martyn Williams, &quot;China Issues Regulations to Control Internet, Newsbytes News Network, February 6, 1996.)</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As the New York Times reported:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Neither organizations nor individuals are allowed to engage in activities at the expense of state security and secrets,&quot; [Xinhua] said. &quot;They are also forbidden to produce, retrieve, duplicate or spread information that may hinder public order.

<P>In mid-February, the Ministry of Public Security ordered all those who use the Internet and other international computer networks to register with the police within thirty days. </P>
<H3>Hong Kong</H3>
<P>Hong Kong has not drafted any policy or released any official statements regarding Internet censorship. The 1987 Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance does not specifically discuss on-line communication, but the ordinance reportedly applies to communication on the Internet. <B>40</B> <font size=2>(Nigel Armstrong and IT Daily, &quot;First Hong Kong Porn Charge Could Take &quot;Weeks,&quot; Newsbytes News Network, August 3, 1995.)</font> The Hong Kong government's Recreation and Culture Branch, which oversees on-line media, recently commissioned a study of on-line communication. Its secretary said that developments in other countries, including the United States, would be taken into account. <B>41</B> <font size=2>(Eric Lai, &quot;Cyberporn a threat to freedom of expression,&quot; South China Morning Post, January 23, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>There are currently more than fifty Hong Kong ISPs, and some censor content, including Hong Kong SuperNet, one of the largest Hong Kong ISPs, which voluntarily ended access to sexually explicit material on Usenet in March 1995. <B>42</B> <font size=2>(Maggie Farley, &quot;Hong Kong's Remedy for Subversive Use of Cyberspace Pull the Plug,&quot; Los Angeles Times, April 25, 1995.)</font> Star Internet followed suit in November, by blocking about twenty newsgroups with erotic text and pictures. <B>43</B> <font size=2>(Lai See, &quot;No Cyber-Sex Please, as Squeaky-Clean Star Internet Takes Axe to Animal Acts,&quot; South China Morning Post, November 24, 1995.)</font></P>
<P>In March 1996, Commissioner of the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority Peter Cheung Po-tak said that controls on the Internet should ensure a &quot;minimum degree of decency&quot; to protect children and said the best solution would be for ISPs to regulate themselves. <B>44</B> <font size=2>(Glenn Schloss, &quot;Hint on Internet Porn Laws,&quot; South China Morning Post, March 29, 1996.)</font></P>
<H3>Singapore</H3>
<P>In Singapore the Internet is treated as a broadcast medium, regulated under the Singapore Broadcasting Authority Act of 1995, which established the Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA). Singapore allows three service providers: Singnet, which is part of Singapore Telecom, Pacific Internet and Cyberway. The government claims that it does not currently censor e-mail, but in 1994 it disclosed that it had searched individual accounts to try to identify those who had downloaded sexually explicit material. After businesses expressed alarmed about the security of their information, authorities said they would refrain from conducting such searches in the future.</P>
<P>The main means of censorship up to now has been to control access. In addition, sexually explicit material and news have been censored by the Ministry of Information and the Arts, the government body in charge of media censorship. Fewer than half of Usenet newsgroups are available through Singnet. Currently there are no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use of any Internet services, and local administrators have to make arbitrary decision on access.</P>
<P>The minister of information and the arts told Parliament that &quot;Censorship can no longer be 100 percent effective, but even if it is only 20 percent effective, we should still not stop censoring....We cannot screen every bit of information that comes down the information highway, but we can make it illegal and costly for mass distributors of objectionable material to operate in Singapore.&quot; <B>45</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Singapore defends censorship in Internet age,&quot; Reuters, July 7, 1995.)</font> Colonel Ho Meng Kit, the CEO of the SBA, the committee that oversees content on the Internet, said objectionable material could be censored through three main channels: technology, legislation, and licensing. He stated that only ISPs would be targeted and noted, &quot;[Censorship] may not always be effective but it makes a statement about the nature of Singapore society and the values it wants to uphold.&quot; <B>46</B> <font size=2>(Jimmy Yap, &quot;Singapore Takes Aim at Cybersmut,&quot; Straits Times (Singapore), July 30, 1995.)</font></P>
<P>Although authorities initially stated that they would not heavily censor political criticism, they have reportedly shifted from watching for sex-related material to watching for &quot;misinformation.&quot; Some topics recently discussed on the newsgroup soc.culture.singapore ranging from Michael Fay's caning to the case of a Filipino maid convicted of double murder sparked the formation of a government administrative committee, which has started Singapore Infomap, a Web site, to provide &quot;correct&quot; information and rebut &quot;inaccurate&quot; information.</P>
<P>In early March, the government announced more severe censorship measures, including the licensing of all ISPs and a requirement to use filtering software. The measures are meant to prevent Singaporeans from accessing sexually explicit material and hate literature, and will also cover politics and religion. The government also announced that World Wide Web content providers would have to register with the SBA, and that three categories of Web pages would be scrutinized: those operated by political parties, electronic newspapers targeting Singapore, and pages concerned with politics or religion. <B>47</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Singapore GovernmentClamps Down on Internet and Supports Its Future,&quot; Telenews Asia (Rozelle, Australia), March 21, 1996.)</font> In April, the regulations tightened further. The SBA announced that it was setting guidelines, to become effective in June 1996, for Internet content providers. According to the preliminary guidelines, those with Web sites must ensure they do not encourage abuse or distribute objectionable information, such as sexually explicit material. Sponsors of discussion groups may have to register with the SBA. Internet content providers and ISPs will be responsible for what is transmitted. The rules also require Internet service providers to institute an acceptable use policy. <B>48</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Singapore Sets Rules for Internet Providers, TV Singapore,&quot; Reuters, April 14, 1996.)</font></P>
<H3>Indonesia</H3>
<P>Indonesia's first commercial provider, Indonet, began operation in late 1994. A number of others soon followed, and the country now has numerous ISPs. The more established electronic bulletin board networks also draw extensively from the Internet. The Internet is more free than any other mass medium in Indonesia, and there are no laws, regulations or ministerial decrees concerning its use. Tempo, a news weekly that was closed by the government two years ago, recently established a site on the Web, with the blessing of the minister of information who agreed &quot;there are no regulations against it,&quot; but warned that &quot;maybe the House [of Representatives] will want to discuss legislating the Internet.&quot; <B>49</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Tempo on Internet is okay: Harmoko,&quot; Jakarta Post, March 13, 1996, as reported on the Indonesia- L mailing list, March 13, 1996.)</font> At this stage, however, the government has chosen to compete with opposing views by establishing its own Web sites. </P>
<P>Armed Forces spokesman Brig.-Gen. Surwarno Adiwijoyo told Reuters news agency that the military had suggested to the Communications Ministry the need for some sort of &quot;toll gate&quot; to &quot;black out&quot; news that could damage culture or affect security. <B>50</B> <font size=2>(Jim Della-Giacoma, &quot;Politics, Not Sex, Indonesian Internet Concern,&quot; Reuters, November 16, 1995)</font> It has also suggested registering uses and users, he said. At present, private ISPs do not carry all Usenet groups, but this is reportedly done in the interests of conserving disk space and because of the language barrier. <B>51</B> <font size=2>(E-mail from John MacDougall, April 9, 1996.)</font></P>
<H3>Malaysia</H3>
<P>The Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems (Mimos), the nation's sole Internet provider, has experienced a huge demand, with an average monthly increase of 22 percent since it began service in late 1994. As of October 1995, there were some 30,000 users. In April 1996, Mimos announced that it would appoint eight new ISPs to help ease congestion.</P>
<P>Usenet newsgroups are heavily censored. The &quot;acceptable use&quot; policy at Jaring, the main Malaysian Internet line, states that &quot;members shall not use Jaring network for any activities not allowed under any Law of Malaysia.&quot; <B>52</B> <font size=2>(Charles A. Gimon, &quot;Internet Censorship Around the World,&quot; Info Nation (Minneapolis,MN), July 1995.)</font> The government reportedly realizes that on-line censorship may not be effective. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad has warned Malaysians that &quot;It depends on the culture. If the culture is weak, we will be the victims. But if we use it in a way that can increase our knowledge, we will get many benefits from the Internet.&quot; <B>53</B> <font size=2>(Lokman Mansor, &quot;Dr. M, Ramos Have a Chat Via the Internet,&quot; Business Times (Kuala Lumpur), January 18, 1996.)</font> However, in March 1996, Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat announced that a new regulatory body would be set up to monitor the Internet and that those criticizing the government &quot;will face the music.&quot; <B>54</B> <font size=2>(Ian Stewart, &quot;Internet Curbs in the Pipelines,&quot; South China Morning Post, March 13, 1996. )</font></P>
<P>In reaction to Malaysian students abroad criticizing Malaysia on the Internet, the government has considered various ways to curb such dissent, according to the information and education ministers, and the education minister proposed cutting scholarships of offending students.</P>
<H3>South Korea</H3>
<P>In South Korea, about half of all Internet users are affiliated with universities or the government. The nationally run telephone corporation, Korea Telecom, started service in June 1994, and there are a number of other commercial providers.</P>
<P>The government has decided to censor computer networks, according to statements by communications officials in October 1995. The decision was reportedly made out of growing concern regarding children's access to sexually explicit and other undesirable material. Local computer networks will be asked to prohibit access by local subscribers to banned sites, according to the Information and Communications Ethics Committee of the Data and Communications Ministry. Sexually explicit material will be banned, along with information deemed &quot;subversive,&quot; such as instructions on making bombs and drugs. Computer games and other software are already censored. Details, such as punishments, have reportedly yet to be worked out. <B>55</B> <font size=2>(&quot;South Korea to Censor Computer Communications Networks,&quot; AP Worldstream, October 20, 1995.)</font></P>
<H3>Vietnam</H3>
<P>The state-owned telecommunications company Vietnam Datacommunications Company (VDC) had planned to launch Internet service earlier this year, but it reportedly put off the opening day because officials decided to first draft regulations on allowable Internet links and users. Internet regulations will reportedly comply with the government's existing censorship regulations. Pham Dao, director of VDC, said that an Internet firewall would be installed to screen out transmissions from specified senders or news resources cutting out much of the anti-government commentary carried by dissident groups, including support for jailed Buddhists and dissidents. <B>56</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Vietnamese Net Provider to Censor Inbound Transmissions,&quot; Telecomworldwire, January 11, 1996, and Jon Auerbach, &quot;Fences in cyberspace; Governments move to limit free flow of the Internet, The Boston Globe, February 1, 1996. )</font> It appears likely that the Ministry ofCulture and Information will monitor on-line content and that Interior Ministry will be in charge of monitoring Internet national security issues. <B>57</B> <font size=2>(Peter Mears, Radio Australia, March 24, 1996, as reported in &quot;Help Sought from Singapore in Policing the Internet,&quot; BBC, March 26, 1996, and &quot;Government to use foreign software to police Internet users,&quot; Agence France Presse, March 24, 1996.)</font> Nguyen Ngoc Canh of the General Directorate of Posts and Telecommunications, which sets communication policy, said competing domestic services likely will be allowed as long as Vietnam Datacommunications Company monitors a single outside link. <B>58</B> <font size=2>(Kathy Wilhelm,&quot;Vietnam Net or Not,&quot; AP, January 4, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>Until recently, Vietnam's Internet service was made available through the Institute of Information Technology, which exists mostly for the benefit of academics and nongovernmental organizations. A VDC official told the press that the organization's effort to control the Internet &quot;is the requirement from our leaders, our government. The Internet must be controlled, not only for technical and security reasons but from the cultural aspect.&quot; <B>59</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Vietnam: Plan by Telecom Authority to Exercise Control Over Internet Disturbs Foreign Investors and Agencies,&quot; Financial Times (London), September 19, 1995.)</font> The government is reportedly worried about sexually explicit material from foreign countries and about &quot;foreign organizations&quot; transmitting information.

<h2>Silencing the Net - Australia and New Zealand</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Australia has been considering regulating the Internet since 1993. In August 1994, the Department of Communications and the Arts released a report, &quot;Regulation of Computer Bulletin Board Systems,&quot; which called for regulations. A year later, the recommendations in that report were updated and released in the &quot;Consultation Paper on the Regulation of On-line Information Services.&quot; One of the goals elucidated in the consultation paper was &quot;to protect freedom of expression, especially with regard to private communication between adults, while at the same time limiting children's exposure to harmful or unsuitable material.&quot; It proposed a system of self-regulation reinforced by legislative sanctions. Objectionable material was defined in the consultation paper as material that &quot;depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that it offends against the standards of morality, decency and proprietary generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that the material should be refused classification.&quot; Restricted material was defined as &quot;material that [is] unsuitable for seeing, reading or playing by persons under 15.&quot; <B>61</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Consultation Paper on the Regulation of On-line Information Services,&quot; Australian Department of Communications and the Arts, July 7, 1996 (URL: <A HREF="http://www.dca.gov.au/pubs/paper_2.html">http://www.dca.gov.au/pubs/paper_2.html</A>))</font></P>
<P>In August 1995, the minister for communications and the arts directed the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), an independent federal authority responsible for the regulation of the broadcasting industry, to investigate the content of on-line information and entertainment services and report to him by June 30, 1996. The resulting ABA &quot;issues paper&quot; became available in December 1995, with an invitation for comments to be submitted by the public until mid-February. The paper discusses various issues involved in the development of a code of practice, the adoption of a classification scheme, enforcement of a code, and blocking offensive sites.</P>
<P>Electronic Frontiers Australia, a nongovernmental organization working for rights of Internet users in Australia, submitted a response to the issues paper, arguing a number of points, including that the Internet, because of its interactivity, significantly differs from broadcast media. &quot;[C]lassification of content is unnecessary and in most instances impossible to police,&quot; it pointed out. The EFA also urged the government to consult with the industry and &quot;develop a grasp of the realities of the on-line service industry.&quot; <B>62</B> <font size=2>(Kimberly Heitman, &quot;ABA Inquiry Submission,&quot; Electronic Frontiers Australia, February 16, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>Some state governments, including those of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania, have already passed or are planning to introduce on-line censorship legislation. <B>63</B> <font size=2>(Michael Sharp, &quot;Internet Porn Pedlars Face Jail,&quot; Sydney Morning Herald, April 3, 1996, and John Davidson, &quot;New Moves on Internet Porn Laws,&quot; Australian Financial Review (Sydney), April 3, 1996.)</font> In early October 1995,eighteen people were being questioned and fifteen computers seized across the state of Queensland for alleged involvement with child pornography, based on the state's Classification of Computer Games and Images Act (1995). In Victoria state, the Classification (Publications, Films &amp; Computer Games Enforcement) Bill, which has passed two houses of Parliament and awaits enactment, makes it an offense to use an on-line network to transmit &quot;objectionable&quot; material to minors. <B>64</B> <font size=2>(Mike van Niekerk, &quot;Censor Moves to Shackle Net,&quot; The Age (Melbourne), February 13, 1996.)</font> Victoria's bill has passed two houses of Parliament. A similar law in Western Australia went into effect on January 1, 1996. Both leave primary censorship in the hands of service providers, and seek to punish senders of information deemed &quot;objectionable&quot; and senders of information classified as &quot;restricted&quot; to minors according to broad definitions contained in the legislation. <B>65</B> <font size=2>(For example, the Western Australia bill defines &quot;restricted material&quot; to be that which a reasonable adult, by reason of the nature of the article, or the nature or extent of references in the article, to matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena, would regard as unsuitable for a minor to see, read or hear.&quot;)</font> ISPs are liable only if they knowingly permit objectionable material to be transmitted on their network. An even more extreme bill now before the parliament in New South Wales will hold individuals and ISPs responsible for objectionable material, which includes not only sexually explicit information but also drug- and crime-related material. All state laws are subject to change when new federal laws are adopted.</P>
<H3>New Zealand</H3>
<P>Restrictive Internet legislation was proposed in Parliament in 1994, but, according to Stephen Bell, an Internet activist in New Zealand, it &quot;is widely perceived as more or less dead&quot; at present because of unrelated political developments. <B>66</B> <font size=2>(E-mail from Stephen Bell to Human Rights Watch, February 1996.)</font> Under the legislation, the New Zealand Technology and Crimes Reform Bill, all users would be cut off from any site that transmitted a single piece of objectionable material to a single user. Those found in violation of the law could be fined thousands and lose the use of a telephone for up to five years.</P>
<P>Under current law, computer disks are treated as &quot;publications,&quot; and may be censored as such under the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act of 1993. If authorities find one example of the more serious grade of &quot;objectionable&quot; material, as defined by the Act, <B>67</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Objectionable&quot; is defined to include that which &quot;describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters such as sex, horror, crime, cruelty, or violence in such a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good.&quot;)</font> they may arrest and shut down an ISP. <B>68</B> <font size=2>(E-mail to Human Rights Watch from Stephen Bell of New Zealand, February 7, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>Apparently fearing possible liability, several universities and Internet providers have been blocking access to newsgroups dealing with erotica. <B>69</B> <font size=2>(Internet Australasia, August 1995 (URL:<A HREF="http://www.interaus.net">http://www.interaus.net</A>).)</font></P>

<h2>Silencing the Net - Middle East</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Middle East is coming on-line in increasing numbers, but many governments are hoping to control access to sensitive political and religious discussion as well as sex-related material. Bahrain went on-line in December 1995 through Batelco, the government-run phone company, after installing an expensive system to block access to certain Internet-related sites. <B>70</B> <font size=2>(Richard Moore, &quot;Huge Demand for Internet Link,&quot; Egyptian Gazette (Cairo), January 11, 1996.)</font> GlobeNet, a U.S. firm, won a contract to provide Internet service in Jordan in 1995 and was asked by authorities to install a special screening facility to control sexually explicit material. <B>71</B> <font size=2>(London Observer Service, &quot;Many Arab nations seek Internet curbs,&quot; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, January 8, 1995.)</font> Kuwait is planning to launch a new Internet service soon, but a Communications Ministry official told the press that the new ISP &quot;must ensure that no pornography or politically subversive' commentary is available in Kuwait.&quot; There is no new content-related legislation planned at present. <B>72</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Kuwait to boost Internet service but plans censorship,&quot; Agence France Presse, April 11, 1996.)</font> In Abu Dhabi, an Internet club &quot;ha[s] agreed to ban sex, religion and politics on the Internet to respect the local laws.&quot; <B>73</B> <font size=2>(Michael Georgy, &quot;Internet Fever Sweeps Gulf,&quot; Reuters, April 4, 1996.)</font> Police in the United Arab Emirates recently held a seminar on combatting political dissent and sexually explicit material. <B>74</B> <font size=2>(Ibid.)</font></P>
<P>In Morocco, the state Office National des Postes et Telecommunications (ONPT) brought the Internet to the nation on November 16, 1995. ONPT has secured an agreement with the commercial companies that will provide the service. Charges will be fixed, and a convention has been signed to govern all aspects of the Internet's operation. The service has been targeted at the banking and insurance sectors, universities, and multinational corporations. <B>75</B> <font size=2>(John Cooper, &quot;The Middle East Gets Caught in the Internet,&quot; Middle East Economic Digest (London), December 4, 1995.)</font></P>
<H3>Iran</H3>
<P>The first Iranian Internet line was opened in 1992 by the Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics through a link to Vienna. <B>76</B> <font size=2>(Stuart Wavell, &quot;Closed Societies Opened by Internet Genie,&quot; Sunday Times (London), September 3, 1995.)</font> The government helped with funds. Internet users, still mostly at universities, now number around 30,000. <B>77</B> <font size=2>(Ibid.)</font> </P>
<P>The government also sponsors a network whose chat rooms allow on-line dialogue between only two subscribers at a time, and private ISPs also exist. Access to the Internet is relatively unregulated, but its increasing popularity will likely result in greater government control. One private network had its lines cut by the Telecommunications Company (TCI) of Iran in August 1995. TCI may have been reacting to reports that the network was being used by young people for sex chats, or it may have been trying to reduce competition to its own network service. <B>78</B> <font size=2>(Cooper, &quot;The Middle East Gets Caught in the Internet,&quot; Middle East EconomicDigest.)</font></P>
<H3>Saudi Arabia</H3>
<P>In Saudi Arabia, Internet access has been confined to universities and hospitals. All local accounts, which automatically note the material accessed, are open to inspection by the Ministry of the Interior. Government officials have justified their reluctance to permit large-scale access on the grounds that there is a need to protect people from pornographic and other harmful effects. Existing pornography laws apply to the Internet, but loopholes are available: large foreign companies are increasingly offering their unmonitored Internet access to Saudi business acquaintances, and commercial members of the GulfNet are also free from scrutiny. </P>
<P>Internet access will reportedly be made available to businesses in 1996, but reportedly with strict controls. Mohammed Benten, a dean at King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, told a local newspaper, &quot;Here in the kingdom, with our strict rules and regulations, we will see the Internet being accessed only for constructive objectives.&quot; <B>79</B> <font size=2>(Faiza S. Ambah, &quot;Dissidents Tap the Net to Nettle Arab Sheikdom,&quot; Christian Science Monitor, August 24, 1995.)</font> Minister of Posts, Telephones and Telegraphs Dr. Ali Al-Johani said in February 1996 that, although the Internet was beyond government control, authorities were investigating how it could be regulated. <B>80</B> <font size=2>(Saleh Al-Dehaim, &quot;Panel Formed to Study Telecom Privatization,&quot; Arab News, January 31, 1996, as reported in Moneyclips, February 21, 1996.)</font></P>

<h2>Silencing the Net - Europe</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The European Union is considering adopting some Internet-related controls. In late January 1996, a European Union Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia said it &quot;hope[d] the EU [would] take all needed measures to prevent Internet from becoming a vehicle for the incitement of racist hatred.&quot; It also called for the &quot;creation of protective judicial measures.&quot; <B>81</B> <font size=2>(&quot;EU Group Calls for Curb on Racism on Internet,&quot; Reuters, January 29, 1996.)</font> It urged all member states to follow the example of Germany, which has been trying to censor racist and pornographic messages. France joined the call for regulation in early February, when the French minister for information technology announced that France would request members of the EU to draft new legislation to cope with legal issues posed by the Internet. It is believed that France's reaction has to do with the recent posting on the Internet of the banned book, Le Grand Secret, by Claude Gubler, the late President Mitterand's physician. <B>82</B> <font size=2>(Sylbia Dennis, &quot;Banned Mitterand Book on the Net Ignites French Government,&quot; Newsbytes News Network, February 5, 1996, and &quot;French plan to stifle Internet freedom,&quot; New Media Age, February 8, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>EU culture and telecommunications ministers met informally in Bologna, Italy in late April 1996, to discuss Internet regulation. At the meeting, France proposed the drafting of a global convention on Internet regulation. The ministers agreed to ask the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, to draw up a report on the question. The Commission is reportedly supposed to determine whether the EU should deal with this issue, or whether the issue should proceed directly to international negotiations. <B>83</B> <font size=2>(&quot;EU/Media Commission Studies Mechanism for Preliminary Notification of National Draft Legislation on Internet ICRT's Position,&quot; Agence Europe (Brussels), April 26, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>That same week in Strasbourg, Irish Minister of State for European Affairs Gay Mitchell called on the EU to investigate controls on the transmission of child pornography on the Internet at a joint meeting organized by UNICEF and the Council of Europe, to discuss the commercial exploitation of children. <B>84</B> <font size=2>(Patrick Smyth, &quot;Mitchell Argues for World Wide Register of Paedophiles,&quot; Irish Times (Dublin), April 26, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>The European Commission reportedly plans to draft a discussion paper on interactive services, including the Internet, which may lead to a directive that may include content regulation. The European Commission is considering a regulation requiring EU member states to send draft national legislation affecting the Internet to the EU in order for member states to vet the laws before they are adopted. The European Commission is reportedly divided over how to standardize Internet policies of its member states. The European Parliament has introduced changes to the EU's broadcasting law to extend its scope to the Internet, but that approach is strongly opposed by many in the computer industry. <B>85</B> <font size=2>(Fiona McHugh, &quot;European Commission Makes Moves to Co-ordinate Policing of EU Cyberspace,&quot; Media and Marketing Europe (London), April 3, 1996.)</font></P>
<H3>United Kingdom</H3>
<P>The UK has not yet enacted any Internet-specific censorship legislation but has relied, instead, on existing laws banning obscenity. Gay groups, however, reportedly feel they are being victimized. An organizer for the London-based group, S&amp;M Gays, for example, told the press that &quot;The police seem to have great difficulty in distinguishing between gay men and pedophiles.&quot; <B>86</B> <font size=2>(Liberty, &quot;Caught in the Net,&quot; Agenda (London), June 1995.)</font> The group closed down its computer bulletin board, fearing that it might become a police target.</P>
<P>In its recent proposals for media ownership, the UK government suggested that the media industry regulator could have some influence over the content of the Internet. An inter-departmental group was set up in March 1995 to examine tackling such issues as sexually explicit material on the Internet. <B>87</B> <font size=2>(Cath Everett, &quot;Internet Pedophile Case Exposes Gaps in the Law,&quot; Computing (London)</font> , January 4, 1996. A new defamation bill extending libel to computer networks was introduced in February 1996; it provides a defense for ISPs as long as they are do not knowingly permit a defamatory statement to be made over their networks. On-line service providers have asked the government for further clarification on their responsibilities under the legislation.</P>
<P>In March 1996, British Trade and Industry Minister Ian Taylor said the UK was seeking a voluntary approach to regulation of content on the Internet. The Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA), a voluntary grouping of service providers to be formally launched in May 1996, is drawing up a code of practice that will cover fair trading issues, and Taylor said that he expected the code to cover &quot;both illegal and undesirable material.&quot; He added, &quot;The only alternative to voluntary action ... is increased political pressure for legislation in various areas. That pressure may get increasingly hard to resist.&quot; <B>88</B> <font size=2>(&quot;UK Back Voluntary Web Censorship,&quot; New Media Age (London), March 28, 1996.)</font></P>
<H3>France</H3>
<P>On March 15, 1996, French ISPs were subpoenaed after a French Jewish student organization brought charges against them for alleged &quot;complicity&quot; in making available propaganda that denies the Holocaust; such propaganda is illegal in France. A decision was to be reached in April, as this report went to press.</P>
<H3>Germany</H3>
<P>Germany and CompuServe have both been criticized for their roles in the CompuServe censorship episode. CompuServe and the German officials involved have made conflicting statements regarding who actually made the decision to censor Usenet newsgroups. As far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, a task force was set up by the Bavarian minister of the interior at police headquarters in Munich in 1994 to search for on-line child pornography. The task force obtained a search warrant to investigate the Munich CompuServe office on November 22, 1995.The search was reportedly more like a visit, in which the authorities told the company of their concerns and CompuServe agreed to comply. Two days later, CompuServe's German managers reportedly stated that they would support German authorities' fight against pornography in cyberspace. On December 8, the authorities gave them a list of more than 200 suggested newsgroups with a letter saying &quot;...it is left to CompuServe to take the necessary steps to avoid possible liabilities to punishment.&quot; CompuServe then made the decision to take all the groups off its servers, apparently without making the effort to look at them. Among the groups it &quot;banned&quot; were discussion groups for homosexuals and the news service Clarinet, which was not even on its servers.</P>
<P>As with other instances of Internet censorship, the ban was an ineffective effort to comply with the demands of an ill-informed authority. CompuServe users still of course had access to the Internet and could therefore connect to other host computers that carried the forbidden newsgroups. In February, CompuServe again provided access to the 200 formerly censored newsgroups, except for five groups. The Bavarian minister of justice recently claimed that CompuServe's new Cyber Patrol software does not meet the company's obligations under German law because the company has an obligation not to supply illegal material to German citizens.</P>
<P>Moving from sexually explicit material to hate speech, in January 1996, Deutsche Telekom (DT), the national telephone company, blocked users of its T-Online computer network from accessing Internet sites used to spread anti-Semitic propaganda, which is a crime in Germany. Authorities also announced that they were expanding their investigation to America Online and Deutsche Forschungsnetz, the national scientific research network. The company was responding to demands by Mannheim prosecutors who were investigating Ernst Zuendel, a German-born neo-Nazi living in Toronto. DT also blocked access to a Santa Cruz, California computer service, Web Communications, that also provides access to Zuendel's site. Web Communications stated that although it did not agree with Zuendel, it was not the company's policy to censor its users. A DT spokesman said that access to certain providers was blocked while government prosecutors investigated on-line neo-Nazi material. The lack of organized monitoring by DT is reflected in the fact that Zuendel's Web site was still available through CompuServe at the same time as it was &quot;banned&quot; through Web Communications. <B>89</B> <font size=2>(Reuters, January 25, 1996, and &quot;German Service Cuts Net Access,&quot; San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, California), January 27, 1996.)</font></P>
<P>Rita Suessmuth, president of the Bundestag, the German parliament, was recently quoted in German newspapers as saying, &quot;The information superhighway must not be allowed to become a forum for those who defile children.&quot; She added, &quot;Freedom of expression reaches its limit when human dignity is violated and violence is promoted.&quot; <B>90</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Bundestag Seeks World Curbs on Internet Child Porn,&quot; Media Daily (Wilton, Connecticut), February 13, 1996.)</font> The government reportedly disagrees with her assessment, however. Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig said in late March 1996 that the government would introduceInternet censorship legislation before the summer recess. The legislation will seek to punish an ISP only if it knowingly permits illegal material on its service, but will not expect ISPs to be responsible for all the content on their servers. <B>91</B> <font size=2>(Andrew Gray, &quot;Germany Plans Bill to Punish Internet Indecency,&quot; Reuters, March 29, 1996.)</font> The legislation is expected to face opposition from the regional states, who plan to contest the measure on constitutional grounds and may propose a more restrictive law. <B>92</B> <font size=2>( Ibid.)</font></P>

<P>Internet censorship has not become a major issue in Latin America. Latin America is fully connected, except for Paraguay, Haiti, Belize and Cuba. In May 1996, Cuba, which at present has only e-mail service, will hold its first national telecommunications and informatics conference, Ariadna 96, to discuss the Internet.

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[In February 1995] South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki pointed out to the G7 conference of wealthy countries that there were more telephone lines in Manhattan, New York than in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa.&quot; Half of humanity has never made a telephone call,&quot; he said. <B>97</B> <font size=2>(Panos Institute, The Internet and the South: Superhighway or Dirt Track?)</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In Africa, access, technology and training are the huge hurdles to cross before censorship will be a major issue. As of late 1995, fewer than ten countries were directly connected to the Internet. In those countries, however, government control and censorship have already asserted themselves. As in Asia and the Middle East, some countries, such as Botswana, that have Internet access do not allow private ISPs to operate. The reason is reportedly not so much one of content control, but of money. The government is anxious not to lose the revenue from its monopoly on telecommunications services. </P>
<P>In the southern African country of Zambia, where Internet access is limited, the February 5 Internet edition of The Post, a daily and one of Zambia's most important opposition voices, was banned by President Chiluba under the State Security Act. The charges relate to a report based on leaked documents, revealing secret government plans to hold a referendum on the adoption of a new constitution. It remained on the Web site for two days until the police warned the ISP, Zamnet Communications, that it would be liable. <B>98</B> <font size=2>(David Lush, Media Institute of Southern Africa, &quot;Action Alert Up-Date Zambia,&quot; February 16, 1996.)</font></P>

<h2>Conclusion: Principles of free expression on the GII</h2>

</CENTER><br><br clear=all>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Rather than striving to control content on the Internet, democratic governments should be working to ensure that the GII becomes truly global, and to motivate citizens to become more involved in decision making as they organize, debate, and share information unrestricted by geographic distances or national borders. It has already been shown that the GII has the potential to:</P>

<UL>
<LI>permit individuals with common interests to organize themselves in forums to debate public policy issues;
<LI>provide instant access to a wide range of information;
<LI>increase citizen oversight of government affairs;
<LI>decentralize political decision making;
<LI>empower users to become active producers of information rather than passive consumers.
</UL>

<P>As noted above, although the extraordinary potential for a GII has been suggested by existing on-line communications networks, the present on-line community is still quite limited. Only countries with a sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure are able to take full advantage of on-line technology. Even in countries with advanced telecommunications infrastructures, only persons with access to equipment and training can take advantage of new information resources. General illiteracy remains the primary obstacle to computer literacy. And while the GII may foster an unprecedented sharing of cultural traditions, current users of on-line technology are primarily American or northern European, affluent, white, and male. </P>
<P>To maximize the GII's potential to promote democracy, it must adopt and expand upon international standards of free expression. National and international guarantees of free expression should be expressly extended to the Internet.</P>

Pistes de r&eacute;flexion sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE</i>. (Rapport No. 6). Maastricht: Centre Europ&#233;en de Gestion des Politiques de D&#233;veloppement.

<HR>

<P>

<H3>Une &eacute;volution in&eacute;vitable</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171;La future coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement ACP-UE ne devrait plus &ecirc;tre r&eacute;serv&eacute;e aux organismes centraux mais elle devrait s'&eacute;tendre &agrave; des acteurs qui jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent ont &eacute;t&eacute; marginalis&eacute;s&#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant du secteur priv&eacute; africain).</I>

<P>

Voil&agrave; un message essentiel qui a &eacute;merg&eacute; au cours de notre processus de consultation. S'il est vrai que le nouveau partenariat entre l'Europe et les pays ACP sera scell&eacute; au niveau gouvernemental, il devra &ecirc;tre guid&eacute;, tant dans son esprit que dans sa mise en oeuvre, par un pluralisme institutionnel et une coop&eacute;ration entre les diff&eacute;rents acteurs du d&eacute;veloppement. Ce processus d'&eacute;largissement de la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne aux acteurs non &eacute;tatiques a &eacute;t&eacute; rendu in&eacute;vitable suite:

<P>

<LI><I>A des processus de changement internes</I>. Dans la plupart des pays ACP, la derni&egrave;re d&eacute;cennie a vu l'introduction d'importantes r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques et politiques. La r&eacute;duction du r&#244;le de l'Etat a cr&eacute;&eacute;, pour le secteur priv&eacute; et les diverses composantes de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, de nouvelles possibilit&eacute;s de participation au processus politique. Ces nouveaux acteurs exigent aujourd'hui d'&ecirc;tre associ&eacute;s au processus de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement ACP-UE;

<P>

<LI><I>Au d&eacute;veloppement participatif</I>. Ce concept existe depuis longtemps, mais il est &agrave; pr&eacute;sent de plus en plus reconnu comme le pivot des partenariats de d&eacute;veloppement. Cela a aliment&eacute; la recherche de nouvelles modalit&eacute;s d'acheminement de l'aide (la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, par exemple) pouvant rapprocher la coop&eacute;ration des besoins des personnes. Les organismes donateurs, y compris la CE, adaptent lentement leur attitude, leurs syst&egrave;mes de gestion et leurs proc&eacute;dures en cons&eacute;quence;

<P>

<LI><I>Au souci d'&eacute;viter les mises &agrave; fonds perdus</I>. L'opinion publique en Europe critique de plus en plus l'utilisation faite des ressources d'aide. Des exigences de justification font pression sur les responsables politiques et les administrateurs de l'aide. Confront&eacute;s &agrave; l'&eacute;chec de &#171;l'Etat d&eacute;veloppemental&#187; (surtout en Afrique), ils cherchent d'autres partenaires capables de garantir &agrave; la fois l'efficacit&eacute; et la responsabilisation. Ceci explique, par exemple, l'augmentation spectaculaire du nombre d'ONG (du Sud) et le niveau des fonds qui leur sont allou&eacute;s.

<P>

<H3>Un grand potentiel &agrave; exploiter</H3>

<P>

Au cours du processus de consultation, on a syst&eacute;matiquement affirm&eacute; que des approches plus participatives - tant au niveau de l'&eacute;laboration des politiques nationales qu'&agrave; celui de l'utilisation des ressources de Lom&eacute; - pourraient &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<LI><I>Des politiques plus r&eacute;alistes</I>. Au cours des derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, les limites d'une approche extr&ecirc;mement centralis&eacute;e et bureaucratique de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement sont devenues manifestes. La participation d'autres acteurs au processus de formulation des politiques pourrait aider &agrave; d&eacute;finir des politiques qui soient mieux ancr&eacute;es dans la r&eacute;alit&eacute; &eacute;conomique et sociale des pays concern&eacute;s.

<P>

<LI><I>Des r&#244;les compl&eacute;mentaires</I>. L'apparition de nouveaux acteurs pourrait d&eacute;boucher sur une meilleure r&eacute;partition des t&acirc;ches et une recherche des compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute;s (par exemple: de nouveaux partenariats public-priv&eacute;). Cependant, cela n&eacute;cessitera une red&eacute;finition du r&#244;le de l'Etat. Nombreux sont ceux qui pensent que le pendule a un peu trop bascul&eacute; dans la voie d'un &#171;Etat minimal&#187;. Ils sont d'avis qu'aucun d&eacute;veloppement ne peut se produire en l'absence d'un appareil &eacute;tatique en fonctionnement; les pays ACP o&ugrave; l'Etat menace de s'effondrer en sont un bon exemple.

<P>

<LI><I>Une appropriation et une responsabilisation accrues</I>. En g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, les approches hi&eacute;rarchiques n'ont ni am&eacute;lior&eacute; le sens de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; parmi les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires de l'aide, ni stimul&eacute; la transparence dans la gestion des fonds. L'ouverture de Lom&eacute; pourrait permettre une r&eacute;partition plus efficace des ressources tout en r&eacute;duisant les probl&egrave;mes d'absorption de l'aide. Plus la responsabilisation est proche des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, plus les chances d'&eacute;viter les mises &agrave; fonds perdus sont grandes.

<P>

<H3>Attention aux risques</H3>

<P>

Il ne faudrait pas sous-estimer la complexit&eacute; du processus de transition vers de nouvelles formes de coop&eacute;ration participative et d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e. De nombreuses personnes soulignent le danger d'un changement trop radical. La d&eacute;centralisation de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement ne devrait pas &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme une panac&eacute;e car elle ne permettra pas automatiquement de rehausser le niveau de participation ou de transparence. A cet &eacute;gard, les risques suivants ont &eacute;t&eacute; mis en &eacute;vidence:

<P>

<LI><I>Le danger d'ignorer l'Etat</I>. L'UE serait malavis&eacute;e de contourner simplement le gouvernement central et de distribuer les ressources au hasard parmi un grand nombre d'acteurs non &eacute;tatiques. Tout d'abord, les organismes donateurs qui adoptent un r&#244;le trop important en d&eacute;cidant seuls avec qui ils veulent travailler rencontrent peu de soutien, ce qui soul&egrave;ve les grandes questions de la souverainet&eacute; et de la responsabilisation politique (en particulier dans les d&eacute;mocraties bien &eacute;tablies). Ensuite, la poursuite d'une privatisation effr&eacute;n&eacute;e et le d&eacute;mant&egrave;lement de l'Etat constitueraient une erreur aussi grande que la centralisation, comme le montre l'exp&eacute;rience de l'Est asiatique.  Le d&eacute;veloppement par le bas a besoin du d&eacute;veloppement par le haut : s'il est vrai que le secteur priv&eacute; et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile sont capables de compl&eacute;ter le r&#244;le de l'Etat, ils ne peuvent cependant pas le remplacer. La coop&eacute;ration future devrait plut&#244;t viser &agrave; renforcer la capacit&eacute; de l'Etat &agrave; remplir sa fonction dans le d&eacute;veloppement, telle qu'elle sera red&eacute;finie. Dans certaines parties de l'Afrique, l'enjeu n'est rien de moins que la &#171;reconstruction d'un Etat viable&#187;.

<P>

<LI><I>La confusion entre les fonds et le contenu</I>. Pourquoi la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne recherche-t-elle la participation d'acteurs autres que l'Etat? S'agit-il seulement de transf&eacute;rer les fonds de Lom&eacute; de l'Etat &agrave; des acteurs non &eacute;tatiques? L'objectif est-il seulement de redistribuer les responsabilit&eacute;s pour la mise en oeuvre des programmes de d&eacute;veloppement? Ou vise-t-on plut&#244;t &agrave; favoriser un d&eacute;bat ouvert et transparent entre les diff&eacute;rents acteurs locaux sur la meilleure fa&ccedil;on de tirer parti du soutien de l'UE?

<P>

<LI><I>La perte de contr&#244;le</I>. On est &eacute;galement tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;occup&eacute; par le danger de transf&eacute;rer des fonds &agrave; des acteurs autres que l'Etat sans &eacute;tablir de syst&egrave;mes appropri&eacute;s de contr&#244;le et de suivi.

<P>

<LI><I>Le manque de capacit&eacute;s</I>. Il ne faudrait pas surestimer la capacit&eacute; des acteurs d&eacute;centralis&eacute;s &agrave; participer au processus de d&eacute;veloppement et &agrave; g&eacute;rer des programmes de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement. Submerger les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques d'&eacute;normes quantit&eacute;s d'aide est une recette menant droit &agrave; l'&eacute;chec. Dans le cas du secteur priv&eacute;, cela cr&eacute;erait une concurrence d&eacute;loyale et cela pourrait tuer la dynamique qui est justement &agrave; la base de la r&eacute;ussite du secteur priv&eacute;. Des contraintes de capacit&eacute;s existent &eacute;galement &agrave; la Commission europ&eacute;enne. L'adoption d'une approche plus participative implique un profond changement dans les attitudes des organismes donateurs, dans leur gestion, leurs proc&eacute;dures et leur organisation.

<P>

Dans la suite de ce chapitre, nous &eacute;tudierons plus en d&eacute;tail ce que cette ouverture de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE peut signifier pour les organisations du secteur priv&eacute; et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile.

<P>

<H3>L'ouverture de la coop&eacute;ration au secteur priv&eacute;</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171;L'UE peut aider le secteur priv&eacute;, tant directement qu'indirectement, &agrave; devenir un acteur &agrave; part enti&egrave;re du d&eacute;veloppement socio-&eacute;conomique des pays ACP&#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant du secteur priv&eacute; des Cara&iuml;bes).</I>

<P>

La version r&eacute;vis&eacute;e de la Convention de Lom&eacute; attache une plus grande importance au d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; et &agrave; la promotion des investissements dans les pays ACP. Ces priorit&eacute;s t&eacute;moignent d'un consensus grandissant entre les Etats ACP et l'UE au sujet de la contribution indispensable du secteur priv&eacute; au d&eacute;veloppement. Le triomphe de l'&eacute;conomie de march&eacute; et la mondialisation des &eacute;changes, ajout&eacute;s aux &eacute;normes probl&egrave;mes sociaux qui frappent la plupart des pays ACP, n&eacute;cessitent la pr&eacute;sence d'un secteur priv&eacute; (local) dynamique, capable de cr&eacute;er des emplois et de g&eacute;n&eacute;rer des revenus.

<P>

L'ordre du jour politique sous-jacent est assez impressionnant. Le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; implique, entre autres choses, un environnement favorable, des mesures incitatives appropri&eacute;es, de nouveaux partenariats public-priv&eacute;, tout une batterie de nouvelles dispositions institutionnelles et des investissements consid&eacute;rables dans le renforcement des capacit&eacute;s d'entreprise et de gestion.

<P>

La responsabilit&eacute; principale du lancement de ces r&eacute;formes se trouve entre les mains des gouvernements ACP. Bien qu'ils trouvent en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral beaucoup &agrave; redire aux attitudes de leurs gouvernements, les acteurs ACP non &eacute;tatiques soulignent tr&egrave;s souvent ce fait. Selon eux, le secteur priv&eacute; est encore trop souvent per&ccedil;u comme un ennemi plut&#244;t qu'un alli&eacute; dans le processus de d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

Nombre de gouvernements ACP doivent encore cr&eacute;er l'environnement favorable et convivial qui stimule le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;. Ou, pour reprendre les propos d'un repr&eacute;sentant du secteur priv&eacute; africain: &#171;Les pays ACP doivent s'aider eux-m&ecirc;mes avant d'aller chercher l'aide des autres&#187;. L'UE peut jouer un r&#244;le catalyseur dans ce processus, &agrave; condition qu'elle revoie, de mani&egrave;re fondamentale, ses strat&eacute;gies, approches et instruments en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;. Les actions prioritaires suivantes ont &eacute;t&eacute; sugg&eacute;r&eacute;es:

<P>

<H4>Mieux comprendre le secteur priv&eacute;</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171;Lorsqu'elle &eacute;voque le secteur priv&eacute;, la Convention regorge de toutes sortes de choses sur le papier, mais elle reste tr&egrave;s vague quand il s'agit de propositions politiques concr&egrave;tes et susceptibles de mise en oeuvre&#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant du secteur priv&eacute; africain).</I>

<P>

Telle est la premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape dans le processus visant &agrave; atteindre les op&eacute;rateurs du secteur priv&eacute;. Une analyse claire et objective de la situation actuelle r&eacute;v&egrave;le une v&eacute;rit&eacute; toute simple: le secteur priv&eacute; se sent compl&egrave;tement marginalis&eacute; dans la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Les principales frustrations du secteur priv&eacute; ACP &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des Conventions de Lom&eacute; successives peuvent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;sum&eacute;es comme suit:

<P>

<LI><I>Manque de participation dans le dialogue politique</I>. Les gouvernements ACP offrent rarement l'occasion au secteur priv&eacute; de participer &agrave; la formulation de politiques de d&eacute;veloppement nationales ou &agrave; l'&eacute;tablissement des priorit&eacute;s dans l'utilisation des fonds de Lom&eacute;. Le dialogue est quasi inexistant entre le secteur priv&eacute; et l'UE (&agrave; quelques exceptions pr&egrave;s peut-&ecirc;tre, telles que le dialogue nou&eacute; gr&acirc;ce au Conseil des Cara&iuml;bes pour l'Europe). Par cons&eacute;quent, les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du secteur priv&eacute; sont en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral mal refl&eacute;t&eacute;s dans la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Des mesures de soutien et des dispositions incitatives ad&eacute;quates font d&eacute;faut. Les domaines de croissance potentielle (par exemple, le tourisme dans les Cara&iuml;bes) ne re&ccedil;oivent pas l'attention qu'ils m&eacute;ritent. Des consid&eacute;rations politiques peuvent supplanter les crit&egrave;res d'efficacit&eacute; dans la r&eacute;partition des ressources de Lom&eacute; (par exemple, dans l'utilisation des fonds du STABEX visant &agrave; r&eacute;duire les d&eacute;ficits budg&eacute;taires).

<P>

<LI><I>Politiques floues de l'UE</I>. La raison d'&ecirc;tre du soutien de l'UE n'est ni clairement expliqu&eacute;e, ni bien comprise. L'objectif est-il d'aider les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s ACP &agrave; int&eacute;grer l'&eacute;conomie mondiale, d'am&eacute;liorer la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; des entreprises ACP ou d'encourager l'apparition de capacit&eacute;s industrielles indig&egrave;nes? Ou bien encore d'aider les entreprises europ&eacute;ennes &agrave; identifier les possibilit&eacute;s d'investissement et les cr&eacute;neaux commerciaux? Sur le terrain,  on constate un manque de coh&eacute;rence politique au niveau de l'UE. Les ressources de Lom&eacute; sont consacr&eacute;es pendant une longue p&eacute;riode &agrave; soutenir la production de r&eacute;coltes destin&eacute;es &agrave; la commercialisation alors qu'ensuite, ces m&ecirc;mes produits se voient refuser un acc&egrave;s pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel aux march&eacute;s de l'UE.

<P>

<LI><I>Gestion centralis&eacute;e</I>. Les acteurs du secteur priv&eacute; des ACP n'arrivent pas &agrave; comprendre pourquoi les &#171;bureaucrates assumeraient la responsabilit&eacute; de la gestion des fonds de Lom&eacute; destin&eacute;s au d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;&#187;. Cela complique l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; la Convention, rend la transparence &eacute;lusive et engendre une paperasserie consid&eacute;rable. Tout ceci tend &agrave; dissuader fortement les op&eacute;rateurs du secteur priv&eacute; de participer &agrave; la vie de la Convention.

<P>

<LI><I>Instruments inappropri&eacute;s et utilisation inad&eacute;quate des instruments</I>. Dans certains pays ACP, on trouve des exemples d'utilisation efficace des instruments actuels de Lom&eacute; pour le soutien du secteur priv&eacute; (l'industrie du caf&eacute; en Ouganda, le secteur horticole au Kenya). Globalement cependant, la Convention ne fournit pas vraiment un ensemble coh&eacute;rent, flexible et diversifi&eacute; de politiques et d'instruments qui soient adapt&eacute;s aux besoins sp&eacute;cifiques du secteur priv&eacute; (qui requiert un environnement stable, l'acc&egrave;s au cr&eacute;dit et au capital-risque, des banques de d&eacute;veloppement pour les petites et moyennes entreprises, des infrastructures &eacute;conomiques favorables, ainsi qu'un accord g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de promotion et de protection des investissements). Le secteur priv&eacute; ne re&ccedil;oit pas de ressources sp&eacute;cifiques. La bureaucratie &eacute;touffante de part et d'autre constitue un obstacle de taille. Le potentiel de la BEI et du CDI est rest&eacute; largement inexploit&eacute;, en partie &agrave; cause de la structure et de la gestion actuelles de ces organisations.

<P>

<LI><I>Manque d'informations</I>. Il est difficile d'obtenir des informations pertinentes sur les possibilit&eacute;s cr&eacute;&eacute;es par la Convention de Lom&eacute; pour le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;. La responsabilit&eacute; de cette situation est partag&eacute;e. Dans la plupart des pays, le secteur priv&eacute; n'est pas assez organis&eacute; pour se rep&eacute;rer dans les m&eacute;andres de la Convention de Lom&eacute;. On reproche souvent aux gouvernements ACP de &#171;confisquer&#187; l'information. Nombre de personnes estiment que la Commission aurait pu intensifier ses efforts pour diffuser l'information, soit par le biais de manuels faciles &agrave; utiliser, soit en organisant des s&eacute;minaires de sensibilisation.

<P>

<H4>Cr&eacute;er des m&eacute;canismes de dialogue et de consultation</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171;L'attitude du gouvernement doit changer. S'il n'est pas dispos&eacute; &agrave; aider le secteur priv&eacute;, il n'y a pas grand-chose &agrave; faire&#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant du secteur priv&eacute; africain).</I>

<P>

C'est l&agrave; un pr&eacute;alable indispensable &agrave; l'&eacute;tablissement de nouveaux partenariats public-priv&eacute;. En associant les secteurs priv&eacute;s &agrave; un dialogue continu et fructueux avec leurs gouvernements respectifs, on pourra petit &agrave; petit apaiser cette m&eacute;fiance historique qui existe entre eux. Cela pourra alors favoriser les flux d'information, la communication, la participation &agrave; la formulation des politiques nationales et, partant, une participation juste et &eacute;quitable &agrave; la programmation et &agrave; la gestion des ressources de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

A cette fin, il faut concevoir une nouvelle s&eacute;rie de dispositions institutionnelles (officielles et non officielles) pour le dialogue et la consultation. On a propos&eacute; la formule d'un conseil &eacute;conomique et social, structure permettant de r&eacute;unir les secteurs public et priv&eacute;, qui obtient d'assez bons r&eacute;sultats dans l'UE et peut s'adapter &agrave; l'environnement ACP. L'exp&eacute;rience dans certains pays ACP semble indiquer que pour qu'un tel conseil fonctionne, il faut que les conditions de gestion publique soient appropri&eacute;es. Dans ce cadre, on pourrait cr&eacute;er diff&eacute;rents forums auxquels participeraient des acteurs du secteur priv&eacute; provenant de domaines divers. D'autres parties prenantes (syndicats, universitaires et organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile) pourraient &ecirc;tre coopt&eacute;es. Ce type de structure interm&eacute;diaire fournirait &eacute;galement une plate-forme pour des n&eacute;gociations tripartites avec la CE (dans le cadre de la programmation des programmes indicatifs nationaux et r&eacute;gionaux). On pourrait &eacute;galement envisager de nouer des relations avec des organisations homologues dans l'UE. Dans le cas des petits Etats insulaires, de tels m&eacute;canismes de consultation pourraient &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre &eacute;tablis au niveau r&eacute;gional.

<P>

<H4>Apporter une aide directe</H4>

<P>

Il est &agrave; pr&eacute;sent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement admis qu'une &#171;approche bureaucratique&#187; du d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; n'a pas beaucoup de sens. La logique, les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et la dynamique des secteurs public et priv&eacute; sont tout simplement trop diff&eacute;rents. Par exemple, les acteurs du secteur priv&eacute; op&eacute;rant sur le march&eacute; ne peuvent s'offrir le luxe de se lancer dans des modalit&eacute;s longues et pesantes de demande de financement de projet. Si le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; doit &ecirc;tre soutenu dans la future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE, il faudra adopter des approches de gestion plus d&eacute;centralis&eacute;es, alliant l'efficacit&eacute; &agrave; la participation fonctionnelle du gouvernement. On peut envisager diff&eacute;rentes options:

<P>

<LI><B><I>La gestion des fonds d&eacute;centralis&eacute;s dans le cadre d'un programme indicatif national ou r&eacute;gional</B></I>. Cette option se fonde sur le principe qu'il existe un v&eacute;ritable dialogue politique entre les secteurs public et priv&eacute; en ce qui concerne les strat&eacute;gies de d&eacute;veloppement et les priorit&eacute;s connexes pour la r&eacute;partition de l'aide (europ&eacute;enne) ext&eacute;rieure. Dans ce cas, il devrait &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre possible de d&eacute;l&eacute;guer la gestion de certains des programmes convenus &agrave; des acteurs du secteur priv&eacute;. Cette option offre deux avantages importants. Premi&egrave;rement, elle organise les mesures d'aide au secteur priv&eacute; dans un cadre politique national. Deuxi&egrave;mement, elle permet une r&eacute;partition pragmatique des responsabilit&eacute;s de gestion bas&eacute;e sur les avantages comparatifs. L'exp&eacute;rience montre que cette formule peut porter ses fruits si les conditions sont appropri&eacute;es.

<P>

<LI><B><I>Le financement direct</B></I>. Cette option propose la cr&eacute;ation d'un cr&eacute;neau distinct en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;. Un pourcentage des ressources accord&eacute;es &agrave; un pays serait r&eacute;serv&eacute; &agrave; un &#171;fonds du secteur priv&eacute;&#187;, g&eacute;r&eacute; directement par l'UE et ses partenaires du secteur priv&eacute;. De nombreux acteurs ACP non &eacute;tatiques sont partisans de cette solution, montrant bien ainsi leur m&eacute;fiance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'ing&eacute;rence du gouvernement et leur d&eacute;sir d'autonomie, y compris dans leurs relations avec la Commission. Cette option peut garantir davantage de flexibilit&eacute; et d'efficacit&eacute;, mais elle comporte aussi des risques. Le financement direct peut &eacute;branler la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; de l'Etat. On court le risque de soutenir une multitude d'activit&eacute;s non coordonn&eacute;es, d&eacute;connect&eacute;es des politiques nationales. Cela peut attiser la rivalit&eacute; au sujet de l'acc&egrave;s aux fonds et attirer des op&eacute;rateurs du secteur priv&eacute; non qualifi&eacute;s (et irresponsables). En outre, le secteur priv&eacute; de la majorit&eacute; des pays ACP est mal structur&eacute; pour se lancer dans ce type de partenariats directs. La Commission pourrait se trouver dans une position difficile, tant au niveau politique qu'op&eacute;rationnel (dans l'&eacute;tablissement des priorit&eacute;s ou dans la s&eacute;lection de partenaires cr&eacute;dibles).

<P>

<LI><B><I>Des fonds fiduciaires du secteur priv&eacute;</B></I>. L'id&eacute;e est d'accorder des  ressources &agrave; des interm&eacute;diaires ind&eacute;pendants, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement &eacute;tablis en tant qu'institutions nationales (publiques). Les fonds seraient distribu&eacute;s, dans le cadre d'une politique nationale, &agrave; des organisations demandant des ressources sur une base comp&eacute;titive. Le pouvoir de gestion serait conf&eacute;r&eacute; &agrave; un conseil d'administration repr&eacute;sentant les diverses parties int&eacute;ress&eacute;es (gouvernement, secteur priv&eacute;, organisme donateur). Cette option permet d'&eacute;viter certains des risques associ&eacute;s au financement direct tout en simplifiant la participation du secteur priv&eacute;. Dans les Cara&iuml;bes, par exemple, on projette l'ouverture d'un &#171;bureau du secteur priv&eacute;&#187; &agrave; la Banque de d&eacute;veloppement des Cara&iuml;bes. Ce bureau serait g&eacute;r&eacute; par une fondation ind&eacute;pendante; il s'agirait d'une sorte de fonds fiduciaire dont la gestion serait partag&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re &eacute;gale entre les repr&eacute;sentants du gouvernement et ceux du secteur priv&eacute;.

<TR><TD>

L'adoption d'une approche d&#233;centralis&#233;e par rapport &#224; certains projets de l'UE (tels que le programme de d&#233;veloppement des exportations en Zambie) semble donner des r&#233;sultats encourageants sur le terrain. Dans le cas de la Zambie, bien que le programme soit dirig&#233; par un organisme semi-public, le conseil d'exportation de Zambie, l'administration du programme a &#233;t&#233; enti&#232;rement d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;e &#224; des op&#233;rateurs du secteur priv&#233; (c'est-&#224;-dire &#224; des associations de fabricants) qui sont membres du conseil et seuls habilit&#233;s &#224; d&#233;cider de la r&#233;partition des ressources financi&#232;res (autrement dit des facilit&#233;s de cr&#233;dit) et de l'utilisation de l'aide technique.

<P>

Les responsables du programme &#224; un niveau local pr&#233;tendent que sa r&#233;ussite tient manifestement &#224; l'absence d'ing&#233;rence du gouvernement dans l'administration au jour le jour du programme. 

</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

<H4>Adopter des approches souples et sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; chaque pays</H4>

<P>

Le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; est une expression passe-partout qui englobe g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement un grand nombre d'acteurs parmi lesquels les secteurs officiel et informel, les petites, moyennes et grandes entreprises et le secteur priv&eacute; &eacute;tranger (dont le r&#244;le est essentiel dans l'apport d'investissements &eacute;trangers directs et le transfert de technologies pour soutenir l'exportation).

<P>

Au-del&agrave; de ce point, cependant, la diversit&eacute; r&egrave;gne. Les politiques publiques, les conditions de gouvernance, l'environnement institutionnel global, les fonctions et niveaux de capacit&eacute;s du secteur priv&eacute; ont tendance &agrave; varier de pays &agrave; pays. Cela n&eacute;cessite, d&egrave;s lors, l'adoption d'approches diff&eacute;renci&eacute;es, sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; chaque pays ou r&eacute;gion, ce qui, &agrave; son tour, a des implications consid&eacute;rables sur la conception des politiques europ&eacute;ennes, des strat&eacute;gies de mise en oeuvre et des instruments ad&eacute;quats pour soutenir le secteur priv&eacute;.

<P>

Dans nombre de pays ACP, les perspectives d'une &#171;insertion harmonieuse et progressive dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale&#187; (trait&eacute; de Maastricht, article 130 U) sont incertaines. La marginalisation serait plut&#244;t &agrave; l'ordre du jour. Dans ces pays, les strat&eacute;gies de soutien seront, in&eacute;vitablement, assez discr&egrave;tes et marginales. L'accent sera probablement mis sur l'am&eacute;lioration de l'environnement politique et des capacit&eacute;s g&eacute;n&eacute;rales pour le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; (petit et moyen).

<P>

L'UE pourrait fournir une &#171;aide indirecte sous la forme de conditionnalit&eacute;s permettant au secteur priv&eacute; de jouer un r&#244;le plus important dans l'&eacute;conomie&#187;. Dans les petites &icirc;les Cara&iuml;bes qui d&eacute;pendent de la culture des bananes, la t&acirc;che consiste &agrave; aider &agrave; restructurer l'industrie de mani&egrave;re &agrave; assurer une plus grande compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; entre le commerce et l'aide, et &agrave; soutenir l'apparition d'un petit secteur &eacute;conomique viable. Dans les &eacute;conomies ACP plus avanc&eacute;es dot&eacute;es d'un secteur priv&eacute; extr&ecirc;mement d&eacute;velopp&eacute; (comme l'&icirc;le Maurice, par exemple) il faudra absolument acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer l'int&eacute;gration de ces &eacute;conomies dans les processus de globalisation par l'interm&eacute;diaire des &eacute;changes internationaux et des investissements &eacute;trangers directs.

L'exemple du R&#233;seau de l'entreprise en Afrique occidentale t&#233;moigne du r&#244;le que les groupes repr&#233;sentant les int&#233;r&#234;ts priv&#233;s peuvent jouer dans une perspective r&#233;gionale.

A moyen terme, et dans le contexte d'une politique de coop&#233;ration europ&#233;enne ax&#233;e sur un plus grand degr&#233; de d&#233;centralisation, le r&#233;seau souhaite devenir l'un des partenaires pr&#233;f&#233;r&#233;s de l'UE et participer &#224; la mise en oeuvre des programmes europ&#233;ens destin&#233;s &#224; soutenir le secteur priv&#233;.

<P>

<H4>D&eacute;velopper les capacit&eacute;s &agrave; tous les niveaux.</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171;Il faut du temps pour faire un entrepreneur, en particulier dans les pays o&ugrave; il n'existe pas de tradition de prise de risques et d'initiative du secteur priv&eacute;&#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant du secteur priv&eacute; des Cara&iuml;bes).</I>

<P>

La r&eacute;ussite de toute tentative d'&eacute;largissement de la coop&eacute;ration au secteur priv&eacute; d&eacute;pendra de l'&eacute;tat de pr&eacute;paration des diff&eacute;rents acteurs concern&eacute;s &agrave; d&eacute;velopper de nouvelles capacit&eacute;s institutionnelles et humaines.

<P>

Tout d'abord, le secteur priv&eacute; doit s'organiser s'il veut &ecirc;tre trait&eacute; comme un partenaire s&eacute;rieux. En fonction des conditions du pays, l'ordre du jour institutionnel pourrait comprendre les points suivants:

<P>

<LI>D&eacute;velopper les aptitudes &agrave; la direction des affaires dans le secteur priv&eacute; (afin qu'il puisse assumer son r&#244;le social dans le d&eacute;veloppement);

<LI>Structurer des organismes repr&eacute;sentatifs capables de promouvoir les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du secteur priv&eacute; (dans toute sa diversit&eacute;) face aux gouvernements et aux organismes donateurs;

<LI>Elaborer de nouveaux accords institutionnels pour canaliser le soutien de l'UE;

<LI>Concevoir des syst&egrave;mes efficaces de suivi, de contr&#244;le et de responsabilisation;

<LI>Am&eacute;liorer les capacit&eacute;s analytiques et les aptitudes &agrave; la n&eacute;gociation;

<LI>Investir dans le d&eacute;veloppement des ressources humaines et dans l'esprit d'entreprise;

<LI>Renforcer les capacit&eacute;s d'association avec les partenaires du secteur priv&eacute; europ&eacute;en.

<P>

Ensuite, il faut renforcer les capacit&eacute;s dans le secteur public. Plut&#244;t que de d&eacute;manteler l'Etat, il faut d&eacute;velopper de nouvelles capacit&eacute;s institutionnelles et humaines afin de permettre la gestion des r&eacute;formes et le fonctionnement d'une &eacute;conomie de march&eacute; dans le contexte du processus de d&eacute;veloppement global. De nouvelles comp&eacute;tences sont &eacute;galement n&eacute;cessaires pour communiquer, participer au dialogue et arriver &agrave; des d&eacute;cisions conjointes avec les acteurs du secteur priv&eacute;.

<P>

Enfin, la Commission doit investir dans le renforcement des capacit&eacute;s afin de concevoir un ensemble plus coh&eacute;rent de politiques et d'instruments soutenant le secteur priv&eacute;, et de g&eacute;rer les programmes sur le terrain d'une mani&egrave;re souple et d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e. Cela n&eacute;cessitera un renforcement de ses propres capacit&eacute;s internes (par le biais du recrutement de sp&eacute;cialistes du secteur priv&eacute;), tant au niveau des d&eacute;l&eacute;gations qu'&agrave; Bruxelles (o&ugrave; la responsabilit&eacute; est dispers&eacute;e dans plusieurs unit&eacute;s diff&eacute;rentes).

<H3>La collaboration avec la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile</H3>

<P>

<H4>Des parties prenantes lointaines ...</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171;Notre gouvernement refuse tout simplement d'associer les ONG &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne. Plusieurs demandes pour recevoir au moins une copie du programme indicatif national ont &eacute;t&eacute; rejet&eacute;es&#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant d'une ONG africaine).</I>

<P>

Les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile (groupements ruraux et de villages, coop&eacute;ratives, ONG, syndicats, associations de d&eacute;fense des droits de l'homme, etc.) constituent un autre ensemble d'acteurs qui insistent pour devenir des partenaires &agrave; part enti&egrave;re dans la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Ils veulent participer &agrave; la mise en oeuvre de l'actuelle Convention de Lom&eacute; IV mais aussi au d&eacute;bat portant sur l'avenir de cet accord de coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

Ils sont d&eacute;&ccedil;us, eux aussi, de la situation actuelle. En d&eacute;pit de tous les discours sur &#171;le d&eacute;veloppement participatif centr&eacute; sur les personnes&#187;, la plupart des gouvernements ACP rechignent &agrave; associer la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile &agrave; la vie de la Convention. On remarque que cette approche hi&eacute;rarchique r&egrave;gne &eacute;galement dans les organisations r&eacute;gionales impliqu&eacute;es dans la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne. Des structures pour le dialogue au niveau national font d&eacute;faut. La soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile a peu de possibilit&eacute;s d'expression au sein des institutions communes de la Convention. On fait actuellement des tentatives prometteuses d'ouverture de l'Assembl&eacute;e paritaire ACP-UE aux acteurs non &eacute;tatiques, mais on est loin d'&eacute;tablir un v&eacute;ritable dialogue politique entre les diff&eacute;rentes parties prenantes. Un simple fait peut illustrer la marginalisation de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile: &#171;A la moiti&eacute; de l'exercice de programmation du 8e FED, l'UE et les Etats ACP ont pris d'importantes d&eacute;cisions relatives &agrave; la r&eacute;partition des ressources et aux secteurs de programmes prioritaires sans qu'aucun effort n'ait &eacute;t&eacute; fait ni pour informer, ni pour consulter les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques du d&eacute;veloppement&#187;.

<P>

Il n'est pas surprenant, d&egrave;s lors, que l'UE soit critiqu&eacute;e par de nombreux acteurs non &eacute;tatiques qui lui reprochent de ne pas pr&ecirc;cher d'exemple. Il faut reconna&icirc;tre que des efforts ont &eacute;t&eacute; faits pour cr&eacute;er des projets sp&eacute;ciaux &agrave; leur intention. Dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; I (1975-1980), d&eacute;j&agrave;, des organisations sociales ont pu b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier de micro-projets. Le syst&egrave;me a peut-&ecirc;tre &eacute;t&eacute; une r&eacute;ussite dans de nombreux pays ACP, mais il faut bien se rendre compte que les micro-projets ne repr&eacute;sentent qu'une toute petite partie de l'ensemble des ressources de Lom&eacute; (2,5% sous Lom&eacute; III). C'est au cours des ann&eacute;es 70 &eacute;galement que la Commission a &eacute;tabli le syst&egrave;me de cofinancement qui a ouvert la voie &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration intensive entre les ONG du Sud et leurs homologues du Nord. Alors que les fonds attribu&eacute;s &agrave; ce syst&egrave;me ont augment&eacute; de mani&egrave;re impressionnante, cette coop&eacute;ration se concentre principalement sur la mise en oeuvre de projets au niveau de la base, une t&acirc;che pour laquelle on se rend compte que les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile pr&eacute;sentent un avantage comparatif. Cependant, les ONG du Sud surtout, veulent &ecirc;tre plus que des &#171;syst&egrave;mes bon march&eacute; de distribution de l'aide &#187; pour la mise en oeuvre des projets. Elles mettent &eacute;galement en doute la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de faire passer cette aide par le canal d'ONG europ&eacute;ennes.

<P>

L'une des principales innovations de la Convention de Lom&eacute; IV (1990-1995) fut l'introduction de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e. Elle visait &agrave; donner le droit &agrave; une grande vari&eacute;t&eacute; d'acteurs du d&eacute;veloppement d'utiliser les ressources de Lom&eacute;. On pr&eacute;tend que la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e refl&egrave;te les principaux objectifs de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE (promotion de la d&eacute;mocratie, d&eacute;veloppement participatif et lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;). Ici aussi cependant, la pratique se r&eacute;v&egrave;le assez diff&eacute;rente. Peu de progr&egrave;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; accomplis dans la mise en oeuvre, principalement en raison d'un manque d'information, de la r&eacute;sistance politique des Etats ACP et de faibles m&eacute;canismes de suivi. Au cours de la r&eacute;vision &agrave; mi-parcours de la Convention de Lom&eacute; IV, les Europ&eacute;ens ont beaucoup insist&eacute; pour &eacute;largir les possibilit&eacute;s offertes aux acteurs non &eacute;tatiques de b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier (directement ou indirectement) de Lom&eacute;. On a &eacute;galement essay&eacute; de faire de la place pour une participation en amont des acteurs d&eacute;centralis&eacute;s dans les processus d'&eacute;laboration des politiques et de prise de d&eacute;cision de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Ce mandat ne s'est pas vraiment r&eacute;alis&eacute;. Des ouvertures limit&eacute;es ont &eacute;t&eacute; obtenues pour la participation d'acteurs non &eacute;tatiques &agrave; la formulation et &agrave; la mise en oeuvre de Lom&eacute;, sans parler de l'apport d'un soutien direct. On n'a proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; aucune remise en cause de la position de monopole des organismes du gouvernement central dans la r&eacute;partition des ressources de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

Le r&eacute;sultat final constitue un paradoxe frappant : alors que l'on admet de plus en plus que les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile ont une r&#244;le crucial &agrave; jouer dans le d&eacute;veloppement, en particulier au niveau des collectivit&eacute;s et parmi un grand nombre de personnes vuln&eacute;rables et d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es, ces organisations sont trait&eacute;es comme des &#171;acteurs secondaires&#187; dans la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE.

<P>

<H4>... nourrissant de grandes esp&eacute;rances ...</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171;Ce dont nous avons s&eacute;rieusement besoin, c'est d'une Convention de Lom&eacute; pour les pauvres&#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant d'une ONG europ&eacute;enne).</I>

<P>

La majorit&eacute; des personnes interrog&eacute;es dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile ont l'impression qu'elles ont une contribution importante &agrave; apporter &agrave; la red&eacute;finition de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; leur exp&eacute;rience dans le domaine du d&eacute;veloppement, les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile ont accumul&eacute; une masse de connaissances et de comp&eacute;tences pr&eacute;cises leur permettant de mieux travailler &#171;directement&#187; avec les populations d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es. Une utilisation plus efficace et plus syst&eacute;matique de ce savoir-faire pourrait contribuer &agrave; r&eacute;aliser les objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement ACP-UE. En les associant &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration des politiques nationales, on arriverait peut-&ecirc;tre &agrave; concevoir une autre s&eacute;rie de politiques socio-&eacute;conomiques et de programmes d'ajustement nationaux mieux adapt&eacute;s aux r&eacute;alit&eacute;s locales et aux besoins des &#171;exclus&#187; (femmes et jeunes).

<P>

Quelles sont les attentes des organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile en ce qui concerne l'avenir? Quels changements recommanderaient-elles si la Convention devait &ecirc;tre radicalement recon&ccedil;ue? Trois esp&eacute;rances principales ont &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es:

<P>

<LI><B><I>Am&eacute;liorer l'acc&egrave;s aux fonds</B></I>. C'est, pour la plupart des organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, la priorit&eacute; num&eacute;ro un. Elles veulent &#171;la part du g&acirc;teau &agrave; laquelle elles ont droit&#187; dans les ressources de Lom&eacute; aux termes du 8e FED. L'exp&eacute;rience ainsi acquise les aiderait &agrave; renforcer les capacit&eacute;s afin de participer au d&eacute;bat sur l'avenir de Lom&eacute; IV.

<P>

Deux modalit&eacute;s principales sont propos&eacute;es pour canaliser ces ressources. Une majorit&eacute; d'acteurs non &eacute;tatiques sont partisans du financement direct qu'ils consid&egrave;rent comme la &#171;voie la plus s&ucirc;re et la plus efficace&#187;, &agrave; condition que &#171;l'on &eacute;tablisse de nouveaux crit&egrave;res pour garantir la s&eacute;lection d'organisations l&eacute;gitimes, cr&eacute;dibles et responsables&#187;. La popularit&eacute; de cette option est un signe manifeste de leur m&eacute;fiance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des gouvernements et de leur d&eacute;sir d'autonomie. D'autres pensent que la voie &agrave; suivre consiste plut&#244;t &agrave; &eacute;largir et &agrave; am&eacute;liorer l'application de la &#171;coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e&#187;. Id&eacute;alement, cette approche place les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile aux commandes tout en encourageant les relations avec les autres acteurs (tels que les gouvernements locaux) et les politiques du gouvernement central. On pense que cette approche est plus prometteuse qu'une distribution des ressources de l'UE parmi une multitude d'organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile travaillant isol&eacute;ment.

<P>

<LI><B><I>Forger des partenariats public-priv&eacute; constructifs</B></I>. Ce message trouve surtout un &eacute;cho dans les pays ACP o&ugrave; les relations entre le gouvernement et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile sont relativement ouvertes et coop&eacute;ratives. Dans ces pays-l&agrave;, les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques affirment que marginaliser les gouvernements serait une erreur. Il s'agit plut&#244;t de &#171;red&eacute;finir le type d'intervention qui est du ressort des gouvernements et du secteur priv&eacute;&#187;. La coop&eacute;ration de l'UE peut contribuer &agrave; stimuler les synergies entre ces deux secteurs. Au dire d'ONG d'Afrique orientale et australe:&#171;Le partenariat et la collaboration entre des secteurs civil, priv&eacute; et public responsables et engag&eacute;s, tant dans les pays ACP qu'entre eux, constituent pour nous le seul moyen de trouver des solutions qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient aux personnes et prot&egrave;gent les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de nos pays&#187;. Dans un avenir proche, il sera extr&ecirc;mement important de trouver de nouveaux moyens et de nouveaux m&eacute;canismes pour garantir ce type de collaboration tant au niveau politique qu'au niveau pratique.

<P>

<LI><B><I>Donner la priorit&eacute; &agrave; la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;</B></I>. Il s'agit de l'objectif politique principal poursuivi par les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile (y compris les ONG europ&eacute;ennes et leurs r&eacute;seaux) dans leur travail de d&eacute;fense sur Lom&eacute;. L'accent mis sur la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; ouvre un vaste programme politique. Cela signifie que les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile doivent se r&eacute;veiller et d&eacute;fendre les meilleures dispositions de Lom&eacute;. Cela les invite &agrave; entreprendre des &eacute;tudes s&eacute;rieuses d'&eacute;valuation des r&eacute;percussions possibles, pour les pauvres (&agrave; divers niveaux), de la lib&eacute;ralisation des &eacute;changes. Cela signifie fournir plus d'efforts pour faire pression afin d'obtenir une prise en consid&eacute;ration correcte des dimensions sociales de l'ajustement et de l'all&eacute;gement de la dette. Certaines ONG vont encore plus loin en affirmant qu'il s'agit de mettre en question de mani&egrave;re fondamentale l'id&eacute;ologie n&eacute;o-lib&eacute;rale et les processus de mondialisation connexes qui sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme &eacute;tant &agrave; l'origine de la pauvret&eacute; tant dans le Sud que dans le Nord.

<P>

<H4>... mais mal &eacute;quip&eacute;es pour participer au d&eacute;bat au-del&agrave; de Lom&eacute; IV</H4>

<P>

Il semble que les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile ont encore un long chemin &agrave; parcourir avant de pouvoir vraiment participer au d&eacute;bat, qui &eacute;volue si rapidement, sur l'avenir de la Convention de Lom&eacute;. C'est l&agrave; un triste paradoxe: &agrave; pr&eacute;sent que l'on supprime les obstacles politiques &agrave; leur participation dans la plupart des pays ACP, il se peut que les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques se trouvent dans l'incapacit&eacute; d'assumer une fonction importante.

<P>

Parmi les principaux &eacute;cueils qui entravent leur participation, citons:

<P>

<LI><I>Un manque de connaissances</I>. La plupart des personnes interrog&eacute;es dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile reconnaissent qu'elles n'avaient &#171;aucune id&eacute;e de ce dont il est question dans Lom&eacute;.&#187; On constate un manque d'informations et de connaissances g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute; des caract&eacute;ristiques de base de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE, des principaux d&eacute;bats politiques et des instruments, y compris, bien souvent, de ceux qui sont con&ccedil;us sp&eacute;cifiquement pour les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile (par exemple, les micro-projets ou la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e). Il en r&eacute;sulte finalement une sorte d'indiff&eacute;rence &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de la Convention de Lom&eacute; et de l'ensemble du d&eacute;bat sur son avenir.

<P>

<LI><I>Une faiblesse des capacit&eacute;s</I>. Dans bien des pays ACP, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile est assez fragment&eacute;e, insuffisamment organis&eacute;e et mal structur&eacute;e. Les ONG du Sud, par exemple, sont souvent des organisations r&eacute;centes, luttant pour &eacute;tablir leur identit&eacute; ou pour maintenir leurs projets en activit&eacute;. Rares sont celles qui se risquent dans un travail de d&eacute;fense. Celles qui se concentrent sur le lobbying ont tendance &agrave; consid&eacute;rer que d'autres questions (telles que l'influence sur les politiques nationales, les questions d'environnement ou celles li&eacute;es au genre, le d&eacute;veloppement social) sont plus importantes qu'une &#171;chose lointaine comme Lom&eacute;.&#187; Ces organisations ne sont en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral pas capables de mobiliser la &#171;masse critique&#187; politique et analytique n&eacute;cessaire pour faire une br&egrave;che importante dans les discussions.

<P>

<LI><I>Des voies de dialogue limit&eacute;es</I>. Les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile disposent de peu de structures de communication et de dialogue bien &eacute;tablies avec leurs gouvernements ou avec les diff&eacute;rentes institutions europ&eacute;ennes (les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations, la Commission &agrave; Bruxelles, le Parlement europ&eacute;en, etc.).

<P>

<LI><I>Des relations fragiles avec leurs homologues du Nord</I>. En Europe, la communaut&eacute; des ONG consacre une partie (assez r&eacute;duite) de ses ressources au travail de d&eacute;fense, y compris &agrave; des questions telles que la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Ce travail est organis&eacute; soit &agrave; un niveau national, soit par diff&eacute;rents r&eacute;seaux europ&eacute;ens (comit&eacute; de liaison des ONG, Euro-Cidse, EUROSTEP, APRODEV) et des r&eacute;seaux th&eacute;matiques (WIDE, EURODAD). Ils font des efforts consid&eacute;rables pour traiter les questions de coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne au d&eacute;veloppement, bien souvent sans recevoir beaucoup de soutien de la part de leurs ONG membres. Dans l'ensemble, cependant, les ONG europ&eacute;ennes n'ont pas vraiment &eacute;t&eacute; capables d'associer compl&egrave;tement leurs partenaires du Sud &agrave; la conception et &agrave; la mise en oeuvre de strat&eacute;gies de lobbying. En Europe, la &#171;voix du terrain&#187; parle trop souvent dans le d&eacute;sert, ce qui tend &agrave; g&ecirc;ner la qualit&eacute; et l'efficacit&eacute; du travail de pression.

<P>

Le message est clair : en l'absence d'informations, d'un renforcement des capacit&eacute;s internes, de structures de dialogue et d'alliances strat&eacute;giques avec les partenaires du Nord, les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile ont peu de chances d'exercer une grande influence sur le d&eacute;bat concernant l'avenir de la Convention de Lom&eacute;.

We were warned that most women would be afraid to speak about their lives in front of the camera, and that they would need permission from either their father, brothers, husbands or sons. Indeed we did have to put a lot of effort into obtaining permits and permissions. However once the women were alone in front of the camera, we were struck by how openly and intimately they were prepared to speak.

Travelling on a Danish train, a young boy sits opposite a mysterious stranger who turns out to be 100,000 years old. The boy is entrusted with a talisman - a timeless objects which holds the secret of eternal life - and, in a series of flashbacks, the 100,000 year-old man tells him the story of his long life, from his birth in the Stone Age period to the present day. It is the story of the human migrations, and the irresistible economic and climatic forces that fuelled those migrations over the centuries. By weaving the educational message into an innovative storylineJim Groser has created a powerful allegory about the inevitability of migration throughout history.

<br clear=left>

The border between Denmark and Germany, agreed after a referendum in 1920, has been undisputed for over 70 years. The border between the Occupied Territories and Israel is one

of the bloodiest, the most debated and the most vulnerable in the world. A study of the psychological need men and nations have to create boundaries, this co-production between Novavision and Afikim Films looks at  the lives of people whose existence is dominated by the presence of borders.<p><br clear=right>

Director Christopher Klint's lyrical documentary is the record of an odyssey around the Mediterranean sea - by felucca, caique and trireme - in search of the traditional music, song and dance of the region. His wanderings take him from the smouldering volcanic Eolian islands off the northern coast of Sicily, where the inhabitants still sing of the horrors perpetrated by the corsair Barbarossa, to his mausoleum on the shores of the Bosphorus in Istanbul.<p>

Scottish artist David Roberts' drawings of the Arab world were first published as a book of lithographs in 1842. In Victorian England - in the fervour of British empire - the book was an overnight success, giving its travel hungry, Bible-reared readers their first impression of the Holy Lands of Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. Director Douglas Lowndes has a long history of productions exploring cultural themes, and his latest film has recreated the seminal journey Roberts took through the Holy Land.

Beneath the deceptive calm of the Mediterranean Sea lies a wealth of history, stored in the wrecks of all the ships that have fallen victim to the unpredictable Mediterranean weather and sunk without trace. The second trilogy of films in the co-production series initiated by CMCA explores three new shipwrecks off the coast of Tunisia, France and Crete. The first two date from the second half of the 17th century, the third from the dawn of Christianity

<p>


In the stormy aftermath of 1993's peace accord between Israel and the PLO, former Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi has emerged as a formidable negotiator and a persuasive voice on the international stage. But beyond the polished rhetoric and the public poise, what drives the 47-year-old mother of two who twice turned down the Ministry of Information portfolio out of fears she would end up running a Palestinian censorship department? Ashrawi's high profile and personal integrity have made her enemies as well as friends. In this intimate document by fellow Palestinian Mai Masri, she recalls her Christian upbringing, her formative teenage years at the American University in Beirut, and her first meeting with Yasser Arafat. She also gives an insider's account of the intricate negotiations with Israel, describes the secret Oslo peace channel she created from her own home, and confronts the challenges ahead for the PLO in the struggle to build a viable homeland state.<p>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Luxembourg's Development Cooperation</h3>



Government development assistance programmes were created in the second half of the 1980s, supported by

the public and the many NGOs in Luxembourg. Support for development cooperation is still high among the

public and in Parliament, based on a humanitarian tradition.

<p>

Net official development assistance grew steadily - and sometimes quite spectacular - since the mid-1980s

and in 1992 stood at US $ 36 million, or 0.26 per cent of GNP, while further rises are planned. 55.5 per

cent of the total ODA was spent bilaterally in 1992, and 25 per cent through the EU. The remaining 20 per

cent mainly went to the World Bank Group. Multilateral assistance and contributions, having been very

high, stabilised since 1988 on 30 - 45 per cent. Luxembourg joined the DAC in November 1992. 

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Development cooperation is the political responsibility of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The management

of Luxembourg's aid programme lies with the Directorate for International Relations and Economic

Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, External Trade and Cooperation. It is not a structure

specifically geared to development problems. Its staff is primarily made up of diplomats, who tend to

change posts, making it hard to build up expertise. In 1992 the administrative structure was completely

overhauled. A legislative framework for development cooperation was established by a number of laws in

1985, and has been up-dated since. It created, amongst other things, a special fund to finance the aid

programme, the FAD, which presently is the main bilateral aid channel. The Development Cooperation

Fund (FCD) is replenished annually by the Government, by budgetary capital gains and by private grants. It

is not subject to the annual budget appropriation principle, which facilitates the administration of

development projects spanning several years. The MFA is responsible for 89 per cent of the total

cooperation budget (1993). The other Ministries involved are the Treasury (for contributions to international

financial institutions), Finance (contributions to certain international organisations), Health, and National

Education. The latter operates a.o. through an independent Agency in the field of cultural cooperation for

countries that are (partially) French speaking.

<p>

For implementation of the bilateral programme the MFA relies heavily on Lux-Development, a private

status company. Set up to promote exports to developing countries in 1978, it is now, after a reorganization

in 1992, a fully equipped implementing agency. Lux-Development has a governing board of 13

representatives from the Federation of Luxembourg Industries, the banks, the Chamber of Commerce,

consulting engineers, and, as representatives of the Government, three members from the MFA, one from

the Treasury and another one from the Ministry of Finance.

<p>

Until now no specific structure within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been set up for the formulation of

development cooperation policy. No formal mechanism has yet been established for programming and

evaluating activities in developing countries. This situation, sometimes causes pipeline problems, with regard

to the disbursement of the planned aid volume. Policy coordination and control - the latter between the

Ministry and Lux-Development - is reported lacking sometimes.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

There is no (formally organised) advisory structure for development cooperation in Luxembourg. Outside

experts and consultants are involved in the technical operations of project and programme preparation and

implementation.

<p>

Annually an activity report of the FCD plus a financial statement is submitted to Parliament, as well as the

annual report of the MFA about development cooperation.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

There are approximately 800 NGOs in Luxembourg. One-fourth of total development assistance is

channelled through NGOs. 65 NGOs that are accredited by the Government (in 1993), are allowed to draw

from the FCD. Coordination of development efforts, streamlining of (co-financing) procedures and

professionalisation are topics of discussion between the Government and the NGOs. Consultative meetings

with government representatives take place about four times a year. An umbrella organisation, the 'Cercle

de Coop&#233;ration des ONG de Luxembourg', is created to represent the main NGOs in their contacts

with the Government and the European Union, as well as to encourage contacts among its members

(currently: 36).

<p>

No development research institutes are reported to exist in Luxembourg.

<h3>Box 3: 'Ideal' ingredients of an agricultural technology information system and related contexts</h3>
<p>
- a widely pervasive and self-financing set of mass-media (radio; television, printed media; video) used in dissemination but also in interactive modes;
<p>
- a solid and reliable network of communications (road; rail; air; telecommunications; electronic and magnetic media);
<p>
 - a comprehensive and reliable network of input supply, backed up by practical, focused research; the same for the processing and marketing of outputs. All would operate in competitive environments, ensuring responsiveness to farmers' requirements, the provision of related advisory services and the earning of no more than normal profits;
<p>
- literate, articulate and assertive farmers, capable of interacting individually with elements of the ATS and of organising rapidly and flexibly into groups - whether based on e.g. common property, input acquisition, marketing, processing or the need to lobby policymakers or defend particular interests;
<p>
- a relatively small public sector extension service, geared to providing services through measures that ensure direct accountability to users: (a) which are not adequately provided by other components of the ATS but which might be charged directly to farmers, e.g. soil testing and related advice; (b) environmental services such as effluent monitoring, which might be financed partly through the fines levied on breaches of regulations; and (c) services to the private sector such as quality control in product processing, health and safety monitoring etc., all of which would be directly chargeable. (In practice, some of these functions might be performed by different regulatory agencies, but the principle of user charges remains intact.)

<center><h3>Herijking Ontwikkelingssamenwerking in het Teken van Kwaliteitsverbetering

</h3>

<h5>Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken,<br>Ontwikkelingssamenwerking Persbericht Nummer 29, 19 September 1995</h5></center>

<br>

<hr>

Er zal de komende jaren hard worden gewerkt aan verdere

verbetering van de kwaliteit en de effectiviteit van de hulp. Zo

zullen er minder projecten worden uitgevoerd en zal vaker worden

gekozen voor andere vormen van hulp die meer op de situatie in een

bepaald land zijn toegesneden. Andere maatregelen hebben

betrekking op de vereenvoudiging van hulpprocedures, verbetering

van het systeem van 'monitoring' en evaluatie, een sterke

delegatie van taken naar Nederlandse ambassades in

ontwikkelingslanden en het geven van meer verantwoordelijkheden

aan de ontvangers van de hulp.

<p>

De keuze van de hulp ontvangende landen zal in de toekomst worden

afgestemd op de diverse instrumenten van de Nederlandse

buitenlandse politiek, waaronder ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Binnen

de groep van ontvangende landen zal een aantal landen meer een

breder samengestelde hulp ontvangen; andere landen ontvangen

uitsluitend hulp in specifieke sectoren.



<p>De norm, waarbij de begroting voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking

overeenkwam met 1,5 procent van het Netto Nationaal Inkomen (NNI),

wordt met ingang van 1997 ingewisseld voor een internationaal

gehanteerde norm, gerelateerd aan het Bruto Nationaal Produkt

(BNP). Het uitgangspunt is dat 0,8 procent van ons BNP wordt

besteed aan zuivere Ontwikkelingshulp (ODA). Hiermee blijft de

omvang van het ontwikkelingsbudget direct verbonden met ons eigen

welvaartsniveau. Op grond van beleidsinhoudelijke overwegingen kan

soms van dit percentage worden afgeweken. Voorop staat echter dat

de netto ODA-uitgaven altijd tussen de 0,75 en 0,85 procent van

het BNP zullen liggen.

<p>

Tegelijk met de herijking van het totale buitenlands beleid van

Nederland heeft ook een nadere evaluatie van de

Ontwikkelingssamenwerking sinds de jaren vijftig plaatsgevonden.

Deze heeft geleid tot een aantal conclusies en nieuwe inzichten

die in de nabije toekomst het gezicht van

Ontwikkelingssamenwerking zullen veranderen. Behalve dat er een

nieuwe norm wordt gehanteerd en gewerkt wordt aan verbetering van

effectiviteit en kwaliteit zal Ontwikkelingssamenwerking ook

worden ge&#239;ntegreerd met buitenlands en veiligheidsbeleid,

internationaal economisch beleid, milieubeleid en ondersteuning

van veranderingsprocessen in het voormalige Oostblok.

<p>

Uit de evaluatie van het ontwikkelingsbeleid - als algemene

inleiding opgenomen in de Memorie van Toelichting bij de Begroting

Ontwikkelingssamenwerking 1996 - blijkt dat goede hulp op een of

andere wijze altijd helpt en een belangrijke bijdrage aan het

ontwikkelingsproces kan leveren, ook al wordt aan bepaalde

voorwaarden niet voldaan. Hulp bleek echter vaak niet in de goede

vorm en tegen de juiste voorwaarden te zijn gegeven. Uit de

ervaringen van het verleden zijn echter veel lessen geleerd en ter

harte genomen. Bewering als zou ontwikkelingshulp ineffectief zijn

missen grond.

<p>

<h3>Begroting 1996</h3>

In 1996 is er voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking ruim 7,1 miljard

gulden beschikbaar. Dit komt overeen met 1,5 procent van het Netto

Nationaal Inkomen (NNI) plus en minus een aantal bedragen waarover

enkele jaren geleden in het Kabinet afspraken zijn gemaakt. De

stijging ten opzichte van 1995 komt ten goede aan programma's in

de meeste begrotingscategorie&#235;n: Speciale Programma's,

Landenprogramma's, Multilaterale hulpverlening, Medefinanciering

van programma's van particuliere organisaties en SNV en

samenwerking met de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba. Vooral voor

nood- en humanitaire hulp, betalingsbalanssteun en het

Medefinancieringsprogramma is het komend jaar meer geld

beschikbaar. In verband met de in het kader van de Herijking

Buitenlands Beleid gemaakte afspraken voor ontwikkelingsuitgaven

zal de overheidsbijdrage aan de medefinancieringsorganisaties -

Cebemo, ICCO, Novib en Hivos - vanaf 1996 in een percentage van

de netto ODA worden uitgedrukt: 9,25 %, door te groeien tot 10

procent in 1999.

<p>

De nota herijking Buitenlands beleid brengt behalve beleidsmatige

en organisatorische ook begrotingstechnische veranderingen met

zich mee. In 1996 worden de uitgaven voor

Ontwikkelinssamenwerking, zoals dat tot dusver het geval was, nog

op de begroting van Buitenlandse Zaken ondergebracht in de

zogenoemde homogene groep Ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Het jaar

daarop vallen de uitgaven voor het totale buitenlands beleid,

waaronder die voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, onder &#233;&#233;n homogene

groep. Bovendien zijn de uitgaven voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking

in 1996 voor het laatst gerelateerd aan het NNI.

Development Co-operation Review of Belgium<br>Summary and Conclusions<P>

<i>OECD Development Assistance Committee</i><p></h3>

<h5>November 1994<br>

For a copy of the full report, please contact OECD Publications, 2 rue Andr&#233; Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France

</center><p>

<hr>

<h4>This Report</h4>

The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.

<p>

The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.

<p>

This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 24 November 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.

<p>

<h4>Main Points</h4>

While Belgian aid accounted for 0.39 of gross national product in 1994, volume declined by 3 per cent in real terms. Budget restrictions forced Belgium to temporarily abandon ints target for aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP by the year 2000 or shortly thereafter. The report identifies three major "areas for concern." First, the need for a clearly articulated strategy; second, a concentration on a few countries with major setbacks in the aid programme; and third, a shortage of personnel.

<p>

For several years, Belgium has been trying to concentrate its assistance to a more limited number of countries, so far with little success. Thematically, aid is directed towards social infrastructure (health and education); themes identified as having high priority in coming years are gender and environmental protection.

<p>

The AGCD administers most of the aid programme. Recently re-organised, it still faces chronic staff shortages. The AGCD has been investigating ways to decentralise the management of its field operations, notably through a joint management system that gives greater responsibilities to the recipients. Efforts alre also being made to enhance cooperation and coordination between the AGCD and Belgian development NGO's.

<p>

Within the AGCD, a monitoring and evaluation unit has been created to assess aid activities and to communicate lessons to the aid community in Belgium and elsewhere.

R&#233;f&#233;rences bibliographiques: ECDPM. 1996. <i>Au-del&agrave; de Lom&eacute; IV - 

Pistes de r&eacute;flexion sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE</i>. (Rapport No. 6). Maastricht: Centre Europ&#233;en de Gestion des Politiques de D&#233;veloppement.

<HR>

<P>

Je voudrais tout d'abord remercier le directeur de l'ECDPM d'avoir organis&eacute; cette conf&eacute;rence et de m'avoir invit&eacute;, ainsi que bon nombre de mes coll&egrave;gues du groupe ACP, &agrave; y participer.

<P>

On laisse entendre, dans certains milieux, que le d&eacute;veloppement, tel que nous le connaissons, ne devrait plus &ecirc;tre un centre d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t. Les politiques de d&eacute;veloppement, a-t-on dit, n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; efficaces et, de toute fa&ccedil;on, le monde a chang&eacute;. Mondialisation et lib&eacute;ralisation sont &agrave; l'ordre du jour. Ce sont l&agrave; les processus qui transformeront l'&eacute;conomie mondiale, y compris les &eacute;conomies des pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

Ce d&eacute;bat (et d'autres qui ont cours actuellement) au sujet de l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE porte en r&eacute;alit&eacute; sur le face-&agrave;-face de la mondialisation et du d&eacute;veloppement. Les riches, les puissants et, bien entendu, les comp&eacute;titifs sont partisans de la mondialisation; les pauvres, les faibles sans d&eacute;fense ont besoin du d&eacute;veloppement. Mondialisation et d&eacute;veloppement sont-ils incompatibles?

<P>

Ces d&eacute;bats, qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;dent la n&eacute;gociation en 1998 d'une convention succ&eacute;dant &agrave; Lom&eacute;IV, d&eacute;termineront la position de l'Union europ&eacute;enne sur cette question cruciale. Ils d&eacute;termineront &eacute;galement s'il est possible d'arriver &agrave; un m&eacute;lange judicieux de politiques et de mesures efficaces destin&eacute;es &agrave; aborder les probl&egrave;mes d'une grande partie des pauvres de ce monde.

<P>

L'ECDPM m'a demand&eacute; de me concentrer sur les questions suivantes :

<P>

<LI>Quelles sont les principales pr&eacute;occupations des ACP en ce qui concerne l'avenir de Lom&eacute;?

<LI>Lors de la red&eacute;finition des relations UE-ACP, que faut-il conserver et que faut-il changer dans l'actuel cadre de Lom&eacute;?

<LI>Le groupe ACP est-il toujours un concept viable et efficace?

<P>

<H3>Principales pr&eacute;occupations du groupe ACP en ce qui concerne l'avenir de Lom&eacute;</H3>

<P>

Le groupe ACP et les habitants des pays ACP veulent de meilleures conditions de vie. Ils voudraient que s'acc&eacute;l&egrave;re le rythme du d&eacute;veloppement de leurs pays. Les pays ACP appr&eacute;cient les Conventions de Lom&eacute; qui se sont succ&eacute;d&eacute; et qui ont consid&eacute;rablement contribu&eacute; &agrave; lutter contre la pauvret&eacute; dans les pays ACP, &agrave; cr&eacute;er et &agrave; am&eacute;liorer les infrastructures, voire, dans certains cas, &agrave; cr&eacute;er des emplois par le biais des exportations.

<P>

Les pays ACP craignent d&egrave;s lors que la mondialisation et la lib&eacute;ralisation, nouvelles panac&eacute;es, n'amoindrissent le soutien accord&eacute; en Europe au maintien de plusieurs dispositions positives de la convention actuelle.

<P>

A cet &eacute;gard, les ACP craignent:

<P>

<LI>des tentatives de r&eacute;duire les flux d'aide sous pr&eacute;texte que l'aide n'est pas utilis&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re efficace ou que les pays ACP ne disposent pas des capacit&eacute;s d'absorption permettant de les utiliser;

<LI>des tentatives de supprimer, de rendre moins efficaces, ou de r&eacute;duire les resssources disponibles pour des aspects de la Convention actuelle qui profitent &agrave; de nombreux Etats ACP, tels que le STABEX et le SYSMIN, par exemple;

<LI>la perte de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences qui, bien qu'elles n'aient pas &eacute;t&eacute; compl&egrave;tement utilis&eacute;es par le pass&eacute;, ont dot&eacute; plusieurs exportateurs ACP d'un avantage comp&eacute;titif sur les march&eacute;s europ&eacute;ens;

<LI>l'&eacute;rosion des b&eacute;n&eacute;fices tir&eacute;s des protocoles sur les produits de base - sucre, bananes, viande bovine.

<P>

La pr&eacute;occupation des ACP, et, par pr&eacute;occupation, j'entends ici leurs souhaits, est simple. Ils voudraient :

<P>

<LI>une convention exploitable, qui ne soit pas surcharg&eacute;e de conditionnalit&eacute;s limitant son efficacit&eacute;;

<LI>des mesures, dans une nouvelle convention, qui contribueraient &agrave; cr&eacute;er les conditions et le climat n&eacute;cessaires aux investisseurs dans les pays ACP, ainsi que d'autres mesures visant &agrave; encourager les investissements dans nos pays;

<LI>des dispositions encourageant et soutenant r&eacute;ellement le secteur priv&eacute; - formel et informel - et favorisant le d&eacute;veloppement des courants d'affaires entre entreprises europ&eacute;ennes et ACP;

<LI>un syst&egrave;me beaucoup plus efficace et bien moins bureaucratique de gestion de la programmation et d'autres processus li&eacute;s aux d&eacute;penses et &agrave; l'utilisation de l'aide de l'UE.

<P>

<H3>Dans la red&eacute;finition des relations UE-ACP, que faut-il conserver et que faut-il changer?</H3>

<P>

J'ose croire qu'il est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement admis que les principes sous-tendant la Convention de Lom&eacute; IV constituent des acquis pr&eacute;cieux &agrave; pr&eacute;server dans une nouvelle convention: je veux parler ici des principes tels que le partenariat, le respect de la souverainet&eacute; des Etats membres, le respect des droits de l'homme, de la d&eacute;mocratie et la non-r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;.

<P>

En cherchant &agrave; r&eacute;pondre &agrave; la premi&egrave;re question, j'ai fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; certaines mesures de Lom&eacute; IV qui pr&eacute;sentent un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t particulier pour les pays ACP et que nous souhaiterions voir maintenues:

<P>

<LI>l'acc&egrave;s commercial pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel aux march&eacute;s europ&eacute;ens

<LI>les protocoles sur les produits de base

<LI>le STABEX et le SYSMIN

<LI>les syst&egrave;mes des PIN et des PIR, entre autres.

<P>

Je voudrais dire quelques mots au sujet des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences. Les ACP n'ignorent pas l'effet, sur leur traitement pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel, de l'Uruguay Round et d'autres mesures prises par l'UE. Bien que les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences se soient &eacute;rod&eacute;es et continuent &agrave; se d&eacute;grader, il restera toujours des marges de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence bien au-del&agrave; de l'an 2000. Si ces marges subsistent, comme nous le pensons, pendant quelque temps encore, elles pourraient, associ&eacute;es &agrave; des mesures favorisant la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;, permettre &agrave; un secteur priv&eacute; ACP dynamis&eacute; de p&eacute;n&eacute;trer le march&eacute; europ&eacute;en. Un appel a &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute; dans les pays ACP et notre secteur priv&eacute; l'a bien re&ccedil;u.

<P>

En ce qui concerne le STABEX et le SYSMIN, nous aimerions voir ces syst&egrave;mes d'importance, auxquels les ACP tiennent beaucoup, &ecirc;tre moins entrav&eacute;s par des conditionnalit&eacute;s qui retardent, pendant de tr&egrave;s longues p&eacute;riodes, l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; leurs ressources. Ce probl&egrave;me doit &ecirc;tre abord&eacute;. Il faut trouver des moyens pour que certains de ces syst&egrave;mes puissent s'auto-alimenter, mais cela demandera un examen plus approfondi.

<P>

Le groupe ACP voudrait une nouvelle convention plus facile &agrave; appliquer que l'actuelle. Lom&eacute; IV comporte trop de dispositions qui constituent simplement une bonne lecture pour ceux qui se soucient de les lire, mais n'ont aucun effet pratique puisqu'elles ne sont jamais mises en oeuvre.

<P>

Les dispositions relatives aux TCDT (transformation, commercialisation, distribution, transport) abondent dans la Convention mais les mesures pratiques -destin&eacute;es &agrave; permettre aux pays ACP de se lancer dans des secteurs &eacute;conomiques plus lucratifs -en rapport avec l'exportation de produits de base et de mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res- sont insuffisantes. Cela se traduit par une Convention inutilement longue et parfois ambigu&euml; qui est interpr&eacute;t&eacute;e et utilis&eacute;e principalement par des ordonnateurs nationaux dans les pays ACP et par des hauts fonctionnaires de la Commission.

<P>

Je pense qu'au-del&agrave; de Lom&eacute; IV nous devons &ecirc;tre plus pratiques et mettre au point un instrument plus compact qui soit utilisable par la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et non plus seulement par un groupe restreint.

<P>

Il faudrait &eacute;galement consacrer des ressources &agrave; l'information du secteur priv&eacute; et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral au sujet de la nouvelle convention, tant dans les pays ACP qu'en Europe.

<P>

<H3>Le groupe ACP est-il encore un concept efficace et viable?</H3>

<P>

Si le groupe ACP n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer. Bien qu'&agrave; l'origine, le groupe ACP ait peut-&ecirc;tre &eacute;t&eacute; form&eacute; pour des raisons historiques, il a, malgr&eacute; sa taille (soixante-dix Etats), remarquablement bien fonctionn&eacute; et les m&eacute;canismes de la Convention ont permis &agrave; la Communaut&eacute; de dialoguer et de se lancer dans des entreprises coop&eacute;ratives sur des bases communes avec une grande partie de la communaut&eacute; internationale. La taille du groupe a am&eacute;lior&eacute; les capacit&eacute;s de n&eacute;gociation des membres et des r&eacute;gions individuels parmi les ACP dans leurs interactions avec la Commission europ&eacute;enne et le Conseil. Le m&eacute;canisme consultatif ACP-UE a ainsi profit&eacute; aux deux parties.

<P>

La r&eacute;gionalisation, pr&#244;n&eacute;e dans certains milieux, affaiblirait les ACP. Elle n&eacute;cessiterait &eacute;galement une augmentation de la bureaucratie et accro&icirc;trait les co&ucirc;ts pour les Etats membres de l'UE. S'il peut sembler logique de traiter s&eacute;par&eacute;ment chacune des trois entit&eacute;s g&eacute;ographiques du groupe ACP, il faut cependant tenir compte du fait que la grande envergure et la diversit&eacute; consid&eacute;rable du groupe ont d&eacute;bouch&eacute; sur un pr&eacute;cieux partage d'exp&eacute;riences, de syst&egrave;mes de gouvernement et de cultures.

<P>

Bien que les pays ACP aient b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; d'une relation particuli&egrave;re avec l'UE, les pays non-ACP n'ont pas pour autant &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;savantag&eacute;s. L'augmentation, sur les march&eacute;s europ&eacute;ens, des exportations en provenance de pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement n'appartenant pas au groupe ACP, qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient en tout cas du SPG ou du super SPG, a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;montr&eacute;e. Dans certains cas, la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement europ&eacute;enne avec des pays non-ACP moins avanc&eacute;s d&eacute;passe de loin les niveaux de sa coop&eacute;ration avec nombre de pays ACP.

<P>

Certains soutiennent que les pays ACP &agrave; revenus interm&eacute;diaires devraient &ecirc;tre trait&eacute;s diff&eacute;remment de ceux qui disposent d'un revenu par habitant plus faible. Il faut consid&eacute;rer cette opinion avec prudence puisque le revenu par habitant ne refl&egrave;te pas toute l'&eacute;tendue du d&eacute;veloppement ou de l'emprise de la pauvret&eacute; sur une soci&eacute;t&eacute;.

<P>

Dans certains pays ACP, le revenu par habitant, m&ecirc;me s'il est &eacute;lev&eacute;, est g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; dans une large mesure par les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences actuelles. Si ces pays perdent leurs pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences, on assistera &agrave; une chute brutale de leurs revenus par habitant. En outre, le revenu par habitant ne refl&egrave;te pas les capacit&eacute;s de comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; qui constituent aujourd'hui notre principale pr&eacute;occupation.

<P>

Si nous devons &eacute;tablir une diff&eacute;renciation sens&eacute;e entre les Etats ACP, je proposerais, monsieur le pr&eacute;sident, que l'on cherche des crit&egrave;res plus appropri&eacute;s.

<P>

<H3>L'avenir</H3>

<P>

Je ne peux prendre la parole lors d'une conf&eacute;rence sur l'avenir de la relation ACP-UE sans indiquer les &eacute;l&eacute;ments suppl&eacute;mentaires que je voudrais voir inclus dans une nouvelle convention.

<P>

Je pense qu'il existe toujours de vastes domaines d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts mutuels entre l'UE et les ACP: en mati&egrave;re d'environnement qui ne connait pas de fronti&egrave;res, dans le domaine de la pr&eacute;vention de la propagation des maladies transmissibles et en ce qui concerne la migration de personnes fuyant les conflits, la faim et les privations.

<P>

Les ACP accordent beaucoup d'attention &agrave; la question des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts mutuels parce que nous pensons que c'est important dans une relation &eacute;troite et durable. Par cons&eacute;quent, on s'attache &agrave; mettre en &eacute;vidence les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques, commerciaux et politiques existants et &agrave; identifier, dans les programmes de d&eacute;veloppement des pays ACP, l'ampleur des projets desquels nos partenaires europ&eacute;ens peuvent &ecirc;tre les principaux b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.

<P>

La structure des exportations ACP vers le monde ext&eacute;rieur montre sa concentration sur le march&eacute; de l'UE. Avec la croissance des &eacute;conomies ACP, que l'on constate dans nombre d'entre elles, leur demande de biens, de services et de capitaux ira &eacute;galement croissant. Si l'on &eacute;laborait une nouvelle convention visant &agrave; stimuler davantage les investissements europ&eacute;ens dans les pays ACP et &agrave; mettre en place des contacts commerciaux plus vari&eacute;s entre les entreprises europ&eacute;ennes et ACP, les pays europ&eacute;ens devraient en &ecirc;tre les principaux b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.

<P>

Les investissements, le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;, l'accroissement de la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; et la durabilit&eacute; devraient &ecirc;tre des traits marquants d'une nouvelle convention. Les effets positifs de l'union mon&eacute;taire et d'une monnaie europ&eacute;enne unique et leur relation avec les devises et les exportations ACP devraient &ecirc;tre &eacute;tudi&eacute;s. Il en va de m&ecirc;me du r&#244;le des garanties pour les investisseurs europ&eacute;ens dans les pays ACP ainsi que de l'effet des mesures fiscales prises dans l'UE sur les pays ACP.

<P>

Dans une nouvelle convention, il faudrait &eacute;galement accorder davantage d'attention &agrave; l'acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration du rythme de l'int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique r&eacute;gionale dans les pays ACP et adopter des mesures sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; cette fin. La masse critique est une force motrice pour l'investissement et les pays ACP, qui ont certainement besoin d'investissements, doivent s'engager, sans tarder, dans la cr&eacute;ation de zones &eacute;conomiques r&eacute;gionales s'ils veulent attirer davantage d'investissements &eacute;trangers directs.

<P>

Les conflits s&eacute;vissant dans plusieurs pays ACP trouvent leur origine dans la pauvret&eacute;, les privations, l'exclusion et la violation des droits de l'homme. L'UE a la capacit&eacute; - financi&egrave;re, &eacute;conomique et diplomatique - de s'attaquer aux racines des conflits et peut-&ecirc;tre m&ecirc;me d'en pr&eacute;venir certains. La Convention de Lom&eacute;, dans son mod&egrave;le actuel, n'accorde pas d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t particulier &agrave; la pr&eacute;vention ni &agrave; la gestion des conflits.

<P>

De la m&ecirc;me fa&ccedil;on, les trafics de drogue et une criminalit&eacute; croissante touchent tant les ACP que l'UE. S'il existe des m&eacute;canismes &eacute;tablis en dehors du cadre ACP-UE pour aborder ces probl&egrave;mes, certains aspects m&eacute;ritent peut-&ecirc;tre d'&ecirc;tre trait&eacute;s dans notre structure ACP-UE.

<P>

Bien que je n'aie pas &eacute;puis&eacute; tous les domaines d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun que les ACP partagent avec l'UE, il est &eacute;vident que, m&ecirc;me en cette &egrave;re d'apr&egrave;s-guerre froide, les ACP rev&ecirc;tent un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t strat&eacute;gique consid&eacute;rable pour l'UE.

<P>

Dans les mois qui viennent, nous devons tous nous appliquer &agrave; fa&ccedil;onner un cadre flexible afin de renforcer les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs entre l'UE et les ACP et de traiter, &agrave; la racine, les obstacles entravant le d&eacute;veloppement de cette relation. Les adaptations que nous apporterons &agrave; la Convention de Lom&eacute; IV et les nouvelles solutions que nous &eacute;laborerons dans une nouvelle convention doivent contribuer au d&eacute;veloppement acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute; des pays ACP au cours du prochain mill&eacute;naire et &agrave; une relation toujours plus &eacute;troite avec nos partenaires de l'Union europ&eacute;enne.

Decades will pass before the conventional benefits of theWeb reach most of the rural South - unlike radio, the world's most-usedmass medium.<p>But the trouble with radio is that it usually has to remain within nationalbounds.  Few stations can afford foreign correspondents - and it isproblematic to send broadcast-quality audio material over long distanceswithout expensive technology, so southern broadcasters are often frustratedwhen they try to acquire affordable foreign news. Content is a problem too:who offers broadcasters global news of human rights and sustainabledevelopment?<p>Now there is to be an innovative new service that aims to meet all theseneeds.  The OneWorld supersite, the world's leading website on human rightsand development issues, has now developed the OneWorld Radio News Service -and it is free to Southern broadcasters.<p>Says OneWorld's editor, Anuradha Vittachi: "To radio's advantages as a massmedium, we are adding the Internet's outreach and flexibility - in order toput the debate about global justice firmly on the world's agenda."<p><h3>THE ONEWORLD RADIO NEWS SERVICE</h3>The pilot project will enable radio broadcasters worldwide to download fromthe Internet - and then re-broadcast from their local radio station - soundclips containing important human rights and development news.  Theinformation is intended to flow both ways: radio stations from the Souththat join the Radio News Service will be contributing material as well asreceiving it. So direct South-South information exchange could become quickand easy.<p>The one year pilot project  is being launched in April 1997 by OneWorldOnline (the Internet arm of the One World Broadcasting Trust) with helpfrom the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association.<p><h3>WELCOME FROM BROADCASTERS</h3>The Radio News Service has already had a warm welcome from internationalbroadcasters.  Govin Reddy, Chief Executive of Radio at the South AfricanBroadcasting Association has expressed to COMBROAD his interest in checkingout the project's potential for SABC.<p>Jonathan Marks, Director of Programmes at Radio Netherlands, went further,emphasising the need for alternative global news networks: "It's a veryimportant development.  Media coverage of an event is too often based onwhether CNN or other big networks are covering it - if they're not, thenthe story is often dismissed as being of no news value.  If the creation ofthis OneWorld Radio News Service means that programme-makers around theworld have greater access to relevant environmental or human rights storiesfrom places where there isn't a camera, and use this opportunity, then it'sfulfilling a vital need."<p>OneWorld and the CBA are eager to involve community radio broadcasters fromthe very beginning of the project.  They hope to give support to existingradio partnership networks, like Pulsar in Latin America.<p>"We are working on a number of projects including a pilot service providingradio spots and announcements on HIV and AIDS," says Steve Buckley,Vice-President of the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters(AMARC) and Director of the national Community Radio Association in theUnited Kingdom.  "We are keen to work in partnership with otherorganisations such as OneWorld who could develop the use of radio forbroadcasting information on social and developmental issues."<p><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>OneWorld has set up a Web site - globally accessible through the Internet -where radio broadcasters can browse through audio news and features andchoose which items they would like to re-broadcast on their stations.There are no copyright restrictions (bar a requirement to attribute thesource).<p>After logging into the OneWorld Radio News Service and choosing a clip, thebroadcaster only has to enter a few short details and a password - and hitthe 'download' button.  The clip will then download to the radio station'scomputer and be ready for local playback.  The clips will play back at veryhigh quality for broadcast, which can then be recorded onto tape andprogrammed into the station's output.  To assist broadcasters, OneWorld hasmade available a text summary of each audio clip, a suggested introduction,in and out points, and a possible back announcement.<p><h3>TECHNICAL DETAILS</h3>To transfer quickly across the Internet, digital audio files must bemassively compressed.  Using RealAudio, this can be achieved with only asmall loss of local playback quality.  Further, Shockwave software allowsaudio to be 'streamed' in realtime over the Internet, for broadcasters tohear previews before downloading clips.  Both pieces of software areavailable free from the Radio News site.<p><h3>HOW TO JOIN</h3>A pilot project of the Radio News Service is already operational.  OneWorldwould like to hear from any broadcasters interested in trying out orhelping set up the Radio News Service.  Registration can be completed withan online form on the Radio News site: <a href="../../radio_news/">http://www.oneworld.org/radio_news/</a>Alternatively, broadcasters can e-mail OneWorld on: <a href="mailto:justice@oneworld.org">justice@oneworld.org</a>  -or fax: 00 1494 481751<p></font></blockquote></body></html>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of French Development

Cooperation</h3>



France's official cooperation with developing countries, which dates from the early

1960s, is an extension of its earlier decolonisation policies and administrative set-up.

The annual opinion poll shows that the French public is concerned about the problem of

the hunger issue, and that there is a growing support for aid to Third World

development (25 per cent in 1992).

<p>

Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 8 270 million, or 0.63 per

cent of GNP. After a period of growth, ODA disbursements are expected to rise only

slightly after 1992. About three-quarters of French ODA is bilateral aid. 24 percent was

disbursed multilaterally in 1992, nearly half via the EU.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Development cooperation is based on a number of successive constitutional laws that

defined France's relationship with its colonies/former colonies, and was elaborated

subsequently in numerous decrees by the President and the Prime Minister. The

administrative set-up and allocation of responsibilities have changed over the years,

following the domestic political situation. 

<p>

Policy preparation, formulation and implementation is spread over four main ministries -

Cooperation and Development (MCD), Foreign Affairs (MFA), Finance and Economic

Affairs (MEA) and the Interior, five or so technical ministries and many (semi-) official

and (semi-) autonomous agencies (educational and training institutes, research

institutes, and NGOs), the latter category being involved mainly in implementation.

<p>

Overall and strategic policy coordination are the responsibilities of the Offices of the

President and Prime Minister. Over and above the internal administrative structure of

the various ministries, decision making is the prerogative of a 'Cabinet', the Office of

each Minister.

<p>

There is no centralised budget for development cooperation, although the Ministry of

Finance and Economic Affairs keeps an overall record of the budget for and expenditure

on development cooperation by the various departments and institutions. 

 

The Ministry of Cooperation and Development, created in 1961 on the basis of the

previous administrative set-up for a French Commonwealth, is responsible for technical,

financial, cultural, military and scientific aid to 'du champ' countries (14.7 per cent of

ODA in 1992). The MCD has the most technical and sectoral expertise of all the

ministries. 

<p>

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has traditionally been responsible for French external

cultural policy in countries not within France's sphere of influence. Within the MFA the

Directorate-General for Cultural and Scientific Relations is responsible for technical,

cultural and scientific cooperation in the 'hors champ' countries (8.7 per cent of ODA in

1992). Another department handles multilateral cooperation and UN relations (24 per

cent of ODA in 1992). The MFA conducts major policy debates, e.g. on security and

European issues. 

<p>

The Treasury at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and the MFA are

currently considered as having the greatest influence on policy matters. The Treasury

disburses financial aid (loans and grants) and, together with the Ministry of

Cooperation, finances debt cancellations in the 'du champ' countries. The Treasury

functions as a consultative body for macro-economic matters, drawing on the

substantial analytical and economic expertise of the CfD (Caisse Fran&#231;aise de

D&#233;veloppement).

<p>

Disbursements to the TOMs, as well as to the DOMs, are administered by a State

Secretariat (Ministry of Overseas Departments and Territories; MODT) under the

authority of the Ministry of the Interior. 

<p>

The technical ministries of Research (7.7 per cent of ODA in 1992), Health, Education

(1992: 8.4 per cent of ODA), Agriculture and Culture each manage their own projects.

<p>

Various development institutions implement projects and programmes, often through

specialist agencies working under them. The Fonds d'Aide et de Coop&#233;ration

(FAC), which is a fund without corporate status, administers economic and social

infrastructure projects. The CfD, a banking agency created in 1941, finances through

its many agencies state approved loans for productive investment projects in the 'du

champ' countries, and recently also in some 'hors champ' countries. The technical

ministries operate in the 'du champ' countries often through institutions working under

their authority. Cooperation with development institutes, the private sector, NGOs and

experts in respect of project identification, assessment and preparation, and

implementation and evaluation of technical cooperation is widespread. In addition, there

are various institutions responsible for the training of and technical support for the

French "cooperants." 

<p>

Policy planning and formulation is a complex process involving many institutions, at

various levels. The main actors are the government institutions and agencies

responsible for French cooperation and the relevant interministerial consultative

structures. While policy formulation and decisions are strictly the responsibility of the

Government, many outside actors are involved at a more technical level. 

<p>

As far as the evaluation function is concerned, generally speaking, a systematic and

independent evaluation structure would seem to be lacking, although all institutions for

development cooperation in principle have an evaluation procedure for ODA-funded

operations. Evaluation and programming units are often part of the internal audit or

statistical function. Procedures for feedback and coordination of evaluation activities

will have to be developed. Some institutions have an evaluation or programming unit,

that has input into policy formulation. Since 1989 the Ministry of Cooperation and

Development for instance has had a Studies, Evaluation and Prospective Analysis

Mission that plans policy on the basis of its reviews of French assistance to 'du champ'

countries. Summaries of the findings are for government use only. 

<p>

Since foreign policy, including aid, is a 'shared' concern, coordination of development

cooperation policy ultimately rests with the President of the Republic and the Prime

Minister. They play a discrete but important and, if necessary, arbitrating role. The

State Secretariat of Planning ('le Plan') at the Prime Minister's Office has an important

coordinating function, as has the 'Cabinet' of each minister.

<p>

In 1992 the Government set up a Committee for Orientation and Programming (COP) to

ensure greater complementarity and coherence of cooperation activities in the 'du

champ' countries. Chaired by the Minister of Cooperation, COP is composed of

representatives from his own Ministry, the MFA, the MEA and the CfD. It has

apparently met infrequently. Suggestions for improvements have been put forward.

<p>

Since EU affairs fall under the Prime Minister, several ministries participate in EU policy

preparation, the MFA having a leading role. The General Secretariat of the

Interministerial Committee (SGCI) defines and coordinates the French position on

European affairs. 

<p>

Consultations between ministries and departments on specific topics do occur, e.g.

between the MCD, MFA, MEA/Treasury, the President's Office and the Ministries of

Environment and Agriculture during the preparations for UNCED. Informal talks are held

on trade, multilateral cooperation, treasury matters and cooperation procedures. Policies

and programmes for 'hors champ' countries are coordinated ad hoc by the departments

concerned. However, the frequency of such talks on the 'hors champ' countries is

considered low. Trade and investment relations with developing countries are discussed

with the Agency for Technical, Industrial and Economic Cooperation (ACTIM).

<p>

Project proposals for funding from FAC or CfD funds are handled in a Project

Committee, chaired by the Minister for Cooperation and Development. CfD activities are

coordinated by a 'Conseil d'Administration' which comprises representatives of the

MCD, MFA, MEA and the Ministry of the Interior (DOM/TOMs). The FAC, which is

chaired by the Minister for Cooperation and Development, comprises representatives of

departments involved in development cooperation.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and

Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

France has strong central governmental institutions. There is a certain reluctancy to

seek official external advice; there is no tradition of this, and no formal structure for it.

In fact much advice is given during technical and political consultations. The dividing

lines between 'consultation', 'advising' and 'decision-making' are not always clear to

outsiders.

<p>

The Minister for Cooperation and Development submits an annual Statement on aid to

Parliament, as an annex to the Finance Act. The National Assembly has a Foreign

Affairs Committee. However, no substantial discussions appear to be conducted in

Parliament.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

Many outside actors make an indirect contribution at least to the

preparation of future policies. First, there are the many research institutes - both

government-financed and independent - that have many years of experience and a

wealth of technical knowledge about the Third World. They undertake studies on their

own initiative and/or may be contracted in by government institutions. Secondly,

private organisations - NGOs and businesses - and the "reseaux" -- sectoral networks

with a broad basis in French society, are involved in implementation and consultation

(see below). Finally, the informal and institutional contacts between politicians at

various levels and individual experts, in organisations ranging from the 'Syndicats

d'Agricole', the White Fathers and M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res, play an

important role in policy consultation and preparation.

<p>

The following categories of organisations, more or less outside the Government, could

be listed as having an 'advisory' impact on French development cooperation policy and

its implementation: informal, mixed brainstorming groups; NGOs and the bureaux

d'&#233;tudes; networks (reseaux); parastatal or state-owned research institutes and

independent research institutes and individual members of their staff. 

<p>

Ad hoc working groups or committees may be appointed to deal with specific subjects,

e.g. the Scientific Committee on Women in Development set up to prepare for the

1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, which includes representatives of the

ministries concerned and the French and European Parliaments, and journalists. 

<p>

Some departments responsible for development cooperation have informal

brainstorming relationships with outside specialists and institutions. The Centre

d'Analyse et de Prospective (CAP) for instance is involved in brainstorming and policy

preparation on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It functions in a rather informal

and independent way, with members from inside as well as outside the Government. 

<p>

In 1992 1 per cent of bilateral ODA was disbursed through NGOs. This is supposed to

reach 5 per cent by 2002. Many of the several hundred French NGOs are involved

actively in French cooperation programmes, through project identification and

preparation, implementation, evaluation, studies and discussions. Discussions with the

Government appear to focus more on the project and programme level than on overall

cooperation policy. Government co-financing activities with NGOs in 'du champ' and

'hors champ' countries are coordinated by an Associations Bureau that both reports to

the MCD and the MFA. 

<p>

The largest of the NGOs (which are now called Associations (or Organisations) for

International Solidarity (AIS) are organised in eight Development Collectives. The largest

collective, created in 1990, is the Comit&#233; de Liaison des Organisations de

Solidarit&#233; Internationale (CLOSI). It comprises eight umbrella organisations that

represent around 250 NGOs. CLOSI, which is financed entirely by the Government, was

set up to improve links between the NGOs themselves and between NGOs and the

Government. A Development Cooperation Board comprising representatives of the

MCD, the MFA, the technical ministries and the NGOs and chaired by the Minister of

Cooperation and Development discusses topics of more general interest. Discussion are

being held on creating a new structure for the joint management, on an equal footing,

of public funds for NGOs: a Public Interest Group (Groupement d'Inter&#234;t Public

(GIP). Many NGOs also have a study and research capacity (the 'bureaux

d'&#233;tudes') and carry out government contracts, for instance GRET, SolaGral,

SURVIE, AGIR-ICI and institutes such as the Institut des Sciences et des Techniques de

l'Equipement et de l'Environnement pour le D&#233;veloppement (ISTEED). An

Evaluation Fund has been established for NGO activities, managed jointly by the NGOs,

the MCD, the MFA and the CfD.

<p>

Since 1992 nine networks (reseaux) have been created on the initiative of the MCD,

comprising institutions and individuals with a recognised interest and expertise in

development cooperation (e.g. farmers' organisations, communities, national and

international women's organisations, NGOs, ex-"cooperants"), as a consultative

structure for the Ministry. These networks, which are financed entirely by the MCD,

were originally set up to work out the details of sectoral programmes for the MCD and

to mobilise development cooperation initiatives in France. They are organised by topics

(e.g. health, women in development, food production). They also have a brainstorming

function: to generate and exchange ideas on development cooperation. In addition they

conduct studies, distribute information on French development cooperation and liaise

with French development institutions, expatriates in developing countries and local

partners (notably in Africa). The original idea was that the networks would grow into

solidarity organisations and undertake development activities. They would appear,

however, to be turning increasingly into implementing agencies for the MCD, although

their relationship with the Ministry is not without its problems. 

<p>

Many large state-owned institutes traditionally do research and carry out studies for the

French Government. The following are well known for their work in development

cooperation: the Institut Fran&#231;ais de Recherche Scientifique pour le

D&#233;veloppement en Coop&#233;ration (ORSTOM), the Centre de

Coop&#233;ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le

D&#233;veloppement (CIRAD) and the Institut de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA).

To some extent the CfD can be included in this group. It has a large analytical research

capacity in various macro-economic fields (e.g. privatisation, debt, regional cooperation

and sustainable development).

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey there are 103 institutes in France - some

attached to universities, and some not, some government owned, others not - that

qualify as Development Research and Training Institutes. Some of these play a

considerable role in development cooperation studies, consultation and implementation,

on an institutional and/or individual basis. The best known of these are the Centre

d'Etudes et de Recherche sur L'Economie du D&#233;veloppement (CERED) in

Nanterre, the Centre d'Etude et de Recherches sur le D&#233;veloppement

International (CERDI) in Clermont-Ferrand, the Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches

Internationales (CERI) in Paris, the Institut d'Am&#233;nagement R&#233;gional (IAR)

in Aix-en-Provence, the Centre d'Etudes d'Afrique Noire (CEAN) and the Centre

d'Etudes de G&#233;ographie Tropical (CEGET), both in Talence. Eight specialised

institutes for applied scientific research in development cooperation are grouped

together in the Study and Research Group for the Development of Tropical Agriculture

(GERDAT). 

<p>

One group in the business sector that is involved in policy consultation is the Conseil

d'Investisseurs en Afrique Noire (CIAN). There are also other consultative structures in

which the Government consults with representatives of the local authorities, and

Chambers of Commerce.

<!!keys: Save the Children Fund+Social Summit+children>
</head>
<body>

<br clear=right>
<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="STCF.html">Save the Children Fund</a></i>
<hr>
<h3>1. The Social Summit: A Vision Which Will Fail</h3><p>
<p>
<i>The World Summit for Social Development (Social Summit) holds out the promise of putting human welfare back at the top of the world's agenda.  Save the Children welcomes this approach but believes it will fail children.</i>

<p>
Save the Children, as a development agency working in 50 countries including the UK, welcomes and supports the Social Summit, for two reasons: 

<ul><li>it is an attempt to establish a new vision for development which puts people first;  
<li>it encompasses the North as well as the South of the globe.
</ul>

<p>
Save the Children fervently hopes that world leaders will heed this call for a new vision.  
<p>
But at the same time, Save the Children believes that <b>there is a flaw at the very heart of the new vision.</b>  As it stands, <b>it will fail children.</b> In so doing, it will fail as a comprehensive tool for social development.  

<p>
Development, to date, has failed millions of the world's children.  Some of the new policies which will be discussed in Copenhagen will bring improvements. But, for social development to succeed, <b>children must be placed at the heart of policy and planning,</b> in ways which the Summit does not adequately address.

<p>
The way societies regard their children and relate to them, the extent to which children's needs, interests and rights are placed centre stage, must come to be seen as a litmus test of their commitment to human and social development.

<p>
<b>A 'Children's Agenda' for development is urgently required.  Save the Children (UK) has been working towards such an agenda.  The following briefing sheets explain why, and what we mean.</b>
<hr>
<h3>2. How Children Have Been Failed So Far</h3>

<p>
The Social Summit's very existence shows that policy-makers are now facing up to the consequences and failings of economic and social development as practised in the last 50 years. Above all, these failings are reflected in the conditions of life for tens of millions of children.
<p>

The last five decades have brought great improvements in infant mortality, nutrition levels, and life expectancy. But they have also brought growing impoverishment and exclusion from these processes, expressed in the widening gap between rich and poor in all societies, including the industrialised countries.
<p>

Around 1.3 billion people, a quarter of the world's population, live in absolute poverty. And across the world, <i>children</i> are much more at risk of living in poverty than the population as a whole.
<p>

<b>Children in developing countries are twice as likely to be poor as the population as a whole. Almost <i>half</i> of all under-fives in the world live in absolute poverty.
<p>

In the UK, the government's own figures suggest that almost one child in three lives in poverty, again much higher than the proportion of the whole population (about one in four).</b>
<p>

These children face considerable threats to their physical and mental development due to ill-health, poor nutrition and poor housing. Such conditions exist in countries at every stage of development.
<p>

There are other impacts on children of the failure of development, including:
<ul><li>
family breakdown, and lack of family support;
<li>child labour and exploitation;
<li>discrimination;
<li>lack of equal access to essential services such as education and primary health care;
<li>abandonment;
<li>trafficking and sexual exploitation of children.
</ul><hr>
<h3>3. Children As A Litmus Test For Social Development</h3>
The failures of development outlined above matter for several reasons -- not least because <i>children are one of the largest groups in any society,</i> developed or undeveloped.
<p>

Globally, one out of every three people is a child under the age of 15. In some countries the proportion is even higher: in many parts of Africa and the Middle East, children are <i>half</i> the population. But even in industrialised countries, between one fifth and one quarter of the population are children. Thus <i>any</i> development model which neglects or damages children's interests must be accounted a failure.
<p>

But the argument against policies which neglect or damage children is not one of 'special pleading'. <b>Damage to children means damage to society as a whole.</b> 
<p>

Childhood is a vital window of opportunity not only for the individual child's development, but for society as a whole. 
<b>Considerable evidence exists that investing in childhood can generate enormous long-term benefits, among them:
<ul>
<li>a happier and more integrated population
<li>a better trained and more productive population
<li>less wastage, such as educational drop-out
<li>lower delinquency
<li>lower expenditure on welfare and social services</b>
</ul>
<p>
By contrast, failure to invest in childhood both denies individuals the opportunity to reach their full potential <i>and</i> has a massive impact on society's own capacity to develop. 
<p>
It deprives children of their right under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to: "a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development". In so doing, it produces societies which are less likely to be well integrated, well educated and productive, and with greater problems of meeting social and welfare budgets.
<p>
<b>Development policies which ignore or damage children's interests are therefore a failure not only on moral grounds but <i>even on their own, largely economic and social terms.</i></b>
<p>
It is for this reason that policy-makers'attitude towards children can be seen as a <b>litmus test</b> of their attitude to social development. It is a test which the documents to be discussed at Copenhagen do not pass.
<hr>
<h3>
4. The Invisibility of Children</h3>

In the policies to be discussed at the Social Summit, as with previous development models, children are invisible. This may be surprising, given the emphasis on social <b>integration and participation.</b> But Save the Children (UK)'s research has discovered that when policy-makers address development:
<ul><li>there is little information or data available specifically related to children 
<li>children's positive and productive contributions to society's development are not recognised
<li>decision-makers see them only as dependents of adults, not individuals in their own right
<li>children are not consulted or expected to participate
</ul>
<p>
In short, <i>policy-makers actually know very little about children's real lives.</i> For example, in research, statistics, government reports and policy proposals children are usually described according to adult categories, often as members of 'households' or 'families'. 
<p>
This can be highly misleading. An increase in household income may not actually benefit the children within the household. Indeed, if it involves extra hours of employment for parents, the attention to children's needs and interests may decrease. 
<p>
Children's contribution to development is not recognised. The majority of children in developing countries 'work', in that they undertake activities which help the household's economic survival. In Brazil, children contribute up to 40 per cent of family income; in India 19 per cent. Children herd animals, fetch water and firewood, help in the fields, and care for other children within the family or community. These active contributions never appear in official figures.
<p>
If, in addition, children are rarely asked to participate or to express their views, this means adults make assumptions about them which are not based on evidence. 
<p>
Thus, <i>policy is made without reference to those whom it affects.</i> In any other sphere it would immediately be clear that any such policy would fail -- this remains unrecognised where children are concerned.
<p>
<b>Save the Children (UK) believes that the goals set out in the Social Summit Declaration will be achieved only if children and their needs, interests and perspectives are placed at the centre of social and economic policy, alongside and equal to those of adults.
<p>
If we wish to make a new start, to give 'social development and human well-being' the highest priority, policy-making can no longer treat children as invisible. A 'Children's Agenda' for development, both North and South, is an urgent necessity. </b>
<hr>
<h3>5. Towards a Children's Agenda</h3>


Save the Children (UK) is actively working towards a Children's Agenda. 

<p>
This will be a long term process, involving a whole range of groups and organisations, and of children themselves, whose participation in the design and implementation of projects is beginning to be explored. 
<p>

However, the outlines are becoming clear, and Save the Children (UK) issues the following call for action to all policy-makers:
<p>

<b>In order to move towards a Children's Agenda, Save the Children recommends that all decisions on social policy, practice and development should adhere to the following principles.</b>
<p>
<ul>
1.	The needs, rights, responsibilities, views and interests of children and adults are not necessarily the same.
<p>


2.	Children are 'social actors' in their own right. They make their own social, economic and cultural contribution to their communities.
<p>


3.	Children have a right to participate in the decisions which affect them, giving informed consent to the fullest extent possible in line with their age, abilities and culture.
<p>


4.	Society must share responsibility with parents for giving every child an equal start in life, and for investing in future generations of adults.
<p>


5.	Families are the basic unit of care, nurturing and support for children, but government and society must support them in these tasks. 
<p>


6.	Child-focused policy and practice must not penalise children. It must ensure that the impact of policy on children is foreseen and beneficial.
<p>


7.	Child-centred policy and practice must be informed by child-centred information and data.
<p>


8.	Different historical, cultural and subcultural traditions of childhood should be recognised and respected -- without endorsing discrimination, exploitation, repression or the waste of potential.
<p>

9.	All development policy and practice should adopt an holistic approach to children's needs.
<p>

10.	Children's needs and capacities vary with age. Social policy and practice should address all age groups, including young people in their teens.
</ul><hr>
<h3>

CHILDREN 'S PLACE IN DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>

The importance of putting children at the centre of development thinking may become clearer by using the following, imperfect parallel.
<p>

It is now recognised by all development planners including governments, UN agencies and non-governmental organisations that development policy will fail unless it fully recognises the specific position of women within societies and social groups.  This was not always so: a revolution in thinking has occurred over the last 30 years.
<p>

Children remain in the position of women 30 years ago in many respects:
<ul><li>
they are invisible in policy-making and not counted in statistics and research
<li>policies are made 'in their best interests' without consulting them
<li>they receive different and unequal treatment, often oppressive
<li>they suffer disproportionately from social adjustment and inequalities in opportunity and well-being
<li>they are seen as unproductive
<li>they are seen as dependent on powerful others, not as social actors
<li>they are denied participation in decision-making
</ul><p>

The parallel is imperfect because childhood is a different state to gender. The boundary between children and adults is less clear than that between women and men; childhood is not a permanent state; and children's ability to take a full part in decision-making is limited by other factors than social position -- such as parental rights and biological immaturity.
<p>

What the parallel does show is how profound and radical a shift in all thinking about social development is required -- if we truly want social development to work.
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

<h3>The World Summit for Social Development</h3>
<p>


The World Summit for Social Development (Social Summit) will take place from 6-12 March 1995 at the Bella Centre in Copenhagen. It was established by UN General Assembly Resolution 47/92 in December 1992

<h3>Focus and Structure</h3>
The Summit represents a call for "social development and human well-being " to be given "the highest priority both now and into the twenty first century" (Draft Declaration 26 January 1995).  To do this it will focus on

<ul><li>the alleviation and reduction of poverty
<li>measures to increase productive employment
<li>measures to promote social integration 
</ul><p>

The Summit comprises two parts: an expert Conference (6-10 March) and a heads of state/ heads of government Summit (11-12 March)

<h3>Documentation</h3>
Two documents will form the basis of discussion at the Conference and agreement at the Summit: the Declaration and the Programme of Action.
<p>

The Draft Declaration sets out a series of key principles. These include the importance of policies which "empower people to strengthen their own capacities, resources and opportunities", the interdependence of economic and social development, and the importance of democracy and human rights. 
<p>

The Draft Declaration's nine commitments are elaborated in the Draft Programme of Action:
<ul><p>

1.	An enabling economic, political, social, cultural and legal environment, conducive to social development
<p>
2.	The eradication of poverty
<p>
3.	The right to work and to secure and sustainable livelihoods for all people
<p>
4.	The promotion of social integration by fostering stable, safe, and just societies
<p>
5.	Full equality and equity between men and women, and enhanced participation for women.
<p>
6.	Promoting economic, social and human resource development of Africa and least developed countries
<p>
7.	Ensure that structural adjustment programmes include social development goals
<p>
8.	Increase significantly and/or use more efficiently resources asigned to social development
<p>
9.	A strengthened framework for international cooperation for social development
</ul><h3>
NGO Forum</h3>
The Social Summit will be paralleled by a Forum of Non-Governmental Organisations, which will be held  at the former naval base on Holmen in Copenhagen.

<TITLE>The Week in Europe</TITLE>

</HEAD>

The Week in Europe, 9 January 1997</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

On Tuesday last (January 8) the European Commission imposed safeguard

measures restricting the volume of rice exported from the ACP (principally

Guyana and Suriname) arriving in Europe via the Overseas Countries and

Territories (OCT) route through the Netherlands Antilles, Turks & Caicos

and Montserrat.  They did so in response to a formal request from Italy,

itself a rice producer, which together with other southern European rice

producing states had become alarmed at increasing volumes of rice appearing

on the European market from the ACP and other sources.

<p>

The Italian request began life, in part, as a tactical measure to try to

force the Dutch government into accepting an Irish proposal to limit ACP

exports by establishing annual quotas for the OCT route (about which more

later). But the safeguard proposals have now become one measure in what is

likely to be a much broader battle, in which five EU member states and the

Agriculture Directorate of the European Commission seek to limit rice

imports from third countries into Europe. Their fear is, that the supply

from outside Europe has increased so dramatically that it will exceed EU

domestic demand, thereby causing the EC to take between 250,000 - 300,000

tonnes of EU produced rice into intervention at the expense of the European

tax payer.

<p>

The history of how this situation has arisen is, to say the least,

complicated. Scarcely four weeks ago it seemed that the then Irish

Presidency of the EU had established a compromise acceptable to all member

states bar one on the much-debated trade aspects of the EU/OCT agreement.

<p>

Under the OCT/EU relationship, which forms part of the Lom&#233; Convention,

products from the ACP which undergo certain transformation in the OCT enter

Europe quota and duty-free. This facility was first used by Guyana and

Suriname for rice and, just as intended, it has had a developmental effect

in the OCT and in the ACP nations concerned. However more recently this

route has begun to be used for sugar from the Dominican Republic, dairy

products, and a range of other sensitive items.

<p>

Faced with this - and subject to a discussion on numbers - the EC, all but

one member state, and the ACP rice producers accepted that a system would

have to be established to set quotas on specific products exported to

Europe in this manner. But the solution required unanimity and the Dutch,

for reasons that are no longer clear, were not prepared to work with other

member states on an acceptable compromise. To the anger of all other EU

nations, Dutch intransigence in a General Affairs Council meeting led to

the Irish compromise not being agreed and the issue remaining unresolved.

<p>

If this had simply resulted in the status quo prevailing, ACP producers

could have slept, if not easily, then without too much discomfort. But what

materially changed the circumstances was a parallel action by Italy to

introduce safeguard measures. Although the Italian position was probably

tactical initially with the objective of encouraging Dutch agreement in the

General Affairs Council, the absence of agreement to the Irish compromise

led directly to a decision to proceed to demand the imposition of safeguard

measures.

<p>

Apparently sensing that their stalling was likely to be damaging to their

own interests, if the result were safeguard measures, the Dutch, just

before Christmas, began to indicate their willingness to compromise on the

trade aspects of the OCT/EU review if EU member states were prepared to:

keep the OCT/ACP trade route open after the Lom&#233; Convention expires;

compensation was offered to owners of mills in the OCT; quotas proposed by

the Irish were increased slightly; and clarification was provided on

certain technical issues proposed by the EC. But this was not enough to put

off those EU member states angry with the Dutch and the ever-increasing

volume of other commodities transiting the OCT, from forging ahead with

safeguard measures.

<p>

So what does all this mean for the small rice farmer in ACP who quite

understandably has planted in the expectation of continuing access to

Europe via the OCT?

<ul>

<li>Firstly exports of ACP rice by this route will be severely limited as the

safeguard quota of 42,650 tonnes per quarter is only about half of existing

export levels if annualised. Moreover quotas allocated for Turks and Caicos

(1328 tonnes) and Montserrat (4594 tonnes) may possibly mean that one or

both routes may close as there is some suggestion that these figures are

below what is commercially viable for the mills concerned. The end result

may therefore be an unseemly battle between millers in the Netherlands

Antilles to see who can ship the most rice by the earliest date, thereby

further dislocating the market in Europe; 

<p>

<li>secondly the whole issue is likely to become highly political in the

Caribbean as the implications of the removal of this successful development

measure becomes apparent on the economies of ACP rice-producing nations;

and

<p>

<li>thirdly in Europe itself further Dutch intransigence  on this issue will

not be welcome while they hold the EU Presidency and have to deal with

immensely more weighty questions on the future of Europe. It may also mean

the early introduction of safeguard measures on sugar and other commodities

using this route through the Netherlands Antilles.

</ul><p>

What  this appears to point to is a possible compromise solution through

early agreement on the much debated OCT/EU dossier in a manner that allows

for sensible quotas for rice and other commodities passing through the OCT.

If such a solution can be found in conjunction with the planned tariff cuts

for ACP rice reaching Europe by the direct route, ACP rice farmers and the

millers in the OCT will have a workable solution.

<p>

What is now required is for the Caribbean Governments' concerned, in

conjunction with their rice industries and representatives of the least

developed OCT's (Turks & Caicos and Montserrat) to make clear in every

possible way, that the issue is a political one requiring a workable

solution to be found as a matter of urgency.

<hr>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;The

situation at the 1993 Aid Review of Italy</FONT></B></A><BR>



<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The last Aid Review took place at a time of dramatic

political upheaval in Italy.  Fundamental reform was being demanded.

 Investigating judges were laying bare a system of entrenched

corruption involving political leaders, major industrial groups

and organised crime.  The aid programme was not immune from these

developments.  Although there was little evidence of corruption

at the operational levels of aid administration, it was plain

that aid management tools had been inadequate to ensure the integrity

and effectiveness of a programme that had expanded too rapidly

in the 1980s.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Public confidence in aid had collapsed.  While the

DAC's 1993 Aid Review identified special strengths in areas such

as conflict resolution and community-based social programmes,

it called for major reforms in administration, including:</FONT>

<UL>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>the introduction of country programming, competitive

procurement, systematic project appraisal and project cycle management;

 creation of an evaluation capacity and strengthening field missions;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>creating the capacity to design and implement

private sector development policies and programmes;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>strengthening staffing levels and staff training;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>reducing the high degree of dependence of NGOs

on state funding.</FONT>

</UL>



<P>

<A NAME="_Toc356020665"><B><FONT SIZE=2><BR>

</FONT></B></A>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>II.  Reforms implemented and the evolution of

public and political attitudes<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Under strong leadership in the Directorate-General

for Development Co-operation&nbsp;(DGCS), the majority of reforms

called for in the 1993 Aid Review are now being implemented. 

The project disciplines, in particular, are being rigorously applied,

and new project proposals are subject to stringent expert examination

against a comprehensive checklist of criteria.  Less effective

older projects have been identified and wound up as efficiently

as possible within contractual obligations.  Evaluation activities

will take some further time to develop fully, but the benchmarks

now being laid down for new projects will provide a sound basis

for future assessments of project effectiveness.   A comprehensive

policy on private sector development has been introduced.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>There is still some way to go to improve the staffing

arrangements and the organisation of the DGCS.  The structure

of the DGCS is overly compartmentalised, and the more sophisticated

economic and social analysis of recipient countries now being

undertaken as a basis for preparing country strategies requires

special expertise.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Since 1993 the level of state funding for non-governmental

organisations has fallen drastically and there has been a crisis,

resolved only by special legislation, in payments to NGOs.  However,

NGOs have been able to maintain and in some cases increase their

activities by drawing on local and EU sources of funding.  And

Italian local and regional authorities are now more involved and

co-ordinated in the assistance effort.  But political circles,

and the public generally, remain sceptical of aid activities.

 Continuing parliamentary investigations have kept the spotlight

on the past errors in the official programme.  Some see aid as

just another part of a wider Italian public management problem,

and DGCS officials have perceived themselves as working in a &quot;climate

of condemnation and ridicule&quot;.  Fortunately there have been

hopeful signs recently of a recognition of reform efforts already

undertaken and of the importance of aid as a part of a modern

foreign policy.<BR>

<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc356020666"><B><FONT SIZE=2>III.  Sharp decline in

core aid activity; increased importance of debt relief</FONT></B></A>

<BR>



<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Italian aid budgets soared in the 1980s, and have

collapsed in the 1990s because of the erosion of public confidence

in aid and the increasingly stringent overall constraints on public

expenditure.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Bilateral grants and loans have taken the brunt of

cuts in aid. Multilateral contributions have been reduced more

gradually, as they are regulated by burden-sharing agreements

which often run for a number of years.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>An increasing share of Italy's total reported aid

arises from the rescheduling on concessional terms of loans originally

made for commercial purposes.  Agreements to facilitate this are

worked out on a multilateral basis in the Paris Club.  Italy has

lent substantial sums to recipient countries which now have major

debt problems and which qualify for concessional debt relief or

exceptional measures.  As the Paris Club reviews the debt positions

of more of these countries over the next few years, Italy's reschedulings

will continue to boost its level of official development assistance

(ODA).  The ODA/GNP ratio of 0.27&nbsp;per cent in 1994 would

have been only 0.18&nbsp;per cent without the debt relief component.

 Funds for debt rescheduling are provided separately from the

main aid budget.<BR>

<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc356020667"><B><FONT SIZE=2>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;The strengths

of Italian aid in the light of DAC principles</FONT></B></A><BR>



<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Italian aid policy reflects the strengths of its

civic traditions and the special role played by small and medium-sized

enterprises in its economic development.  It emphasizes principles

of human solidarity and the promotion of self-reliant and sustainable

development, not only in economic, but also in environmental,

social and cultural terms.  These principles closely reflect the

norms and guidelines which Members of the Development Assistance

Committee have elaborated.  Particular features of Italy's programme

include:<BR>

</FONT>

<UL>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Regions, municipalities and non-governmental

organisations make a major contribution to development, relief

and reconstruction efforts, and mechanisms have been established

to ensure that their contributions are well co-ordinated both

among themselves and with official activities.  One example is

the &quot;Tavolo di Coordinamento&quot; which co-ordinates Italian

aid to the former Yugoslavia.  Important developments and debates

are underway in Italy on the expansion of this kind of &quot;decentralised

aid&quot;.</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>On the recipient level, Italy has developed effective

social development strategies showing how official programmes

can involve local people to improve economic and social conditions,

build up institutional capacity and promote gender equality. 

The major Italian-funded effort to promote the reintegration of

refugees in Central America, PRODERE, has served as a model for

these interventions.</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>There is close collaboration with multilateral

agencies, particularly in relief and peace-building programmes

like PRODERE, but also in development activities such as the World

Bank-led Albanian Development Fund.</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>More open and competitive bidding procedures

have been introduced.  In many cases, recipient governments are

now running the tender process, which increases their own expertise

and helps ensure that assistance meets their needs.  More aid

is now effectively untied, following a dramatic fall in infrastructure

projects and the channelling of more aid through international

organisations  which conduct procurement under their own rules.</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Activities to develop the private sector now

account for about one&nbsp;quarter of the bilateral programme.

 These bring the strengths of Italian small and medium-sized enterprise

to bear on the key tasks of building a modern market economy in

Italy's priority recipients.  Projects stress technical and marketing

assistance and knowledge transfer, not just efficient provision

of equipment.</FONT>

</UL>



<P>

<A NAME="_Toc356020668"><B><FONT SIZE=2><BR>

</FONT></B></A>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ahead<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The Italian authorities have introduced major reforms

to improve the quality and transparency of the aid programme.

 Current aid allocations are being effectively employed.  Italy's

experiences with people-to-people aid involving the Italian community

and in grass-roots based social programmes, including in conflict

zones, provide models of interest for the whole aid community.

<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>To build on these strengths the Italian authorities

need to:<BR>

</FONT>

<UL>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>continue the reform of the administration and

staffing structure so that ongoing improvements to country programmes,

policy analysis, project disciplines and evaluation could yield

their full benefits;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>amend existing budget provisions to allow assured

financing for aid programmes and projects which extend over several

years;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>modify administrative procedures so as to enhance

flexibility and effectiveness, while emphasizing accountability

for results as well as financial integrity;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>reinforce interdepartmental co-ordination, especially

on funding for multilateral development banks;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>enhance consultation arrangements with regions,

municipalities, NGOs and social partners, including business and

unions, on broad policy directions for aid;</FONT>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>increase funding for bilateral aid to a level

consistent with Italy's foreign policy aims, its improved management

capacity, and the scope for effective use of aid by Italy's main

development partners.</FONT>

</UL>



<P>

<FONT SIZE=2></FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The basis exists for restoring public confidence

and building a new consensus around a style of aid which reflects

Italy's concern for international solidarity, uses Italy's special

talents and civic traditions, and helps achieve its foreign policy

goals.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>This consensus should be consolidated in a new law

to govern development co-operation  based on the major progress

in aid management over the past three years and taking account

of the lessons learnt in the course of the recent parliamentary

enquiries.<BR>

</FONT>

<TITLE>The Week in Europe</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<hr>

<H2><center><p></a>

The Week in Europe, 2 January 1997</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

It is no exaggeration to say that 1997 will be the most critical year in

the history of the Europe/Caribbean relationship since Britain decided to

become a member of the European Community, thereby changing its

relationship with the Caribbean irrevocably. 

<p>

This year will be the one in which inter-European politics will decide the

structure of the future relationship between the Caribbean and Europe. This

will not be by any considered  action relating to the Caribbean alone, but

as a result of decisions that will be taken on the way in which Europe sees

its own future and its ties with the wider world. How the Caribbean or

individual nations in the region choose to interest Europe in their future

will determine whether a new form of special relationship can be

established or whether the Caribbean is to see its identity increasingly

subsumed into that of the Americas.

<p>

The most obvious issue in Europe in 1997, when seen from a Caribbean

perspective, is the negotiation of a successor agreement to Lom&#233; IV which

will be the subject of many more column inches as the year proceeds.

Suffice it to say at this time, the European Commission has produced its

discussion document, and Germany, the UK, Holland, France and Spain have

all either developed post Lom&#233; positions or are finalising them. As a

result Europe will have debated and completed its approach by  either the

end of the Dutch Presidency in June, or most probably the start of the

Luxembourg Presidency in the second part of the year.

<p>

Of less apparent impact, but of much greater potency in the long term will

be the inter-European debate that will take place in the first six months

of this year on revisions to the Maastricht Treaty during the EU's Inter

Governmental Conference (IGC). This Heads of Government meeting will

establish the basis on which the mechanisms that will govern Europe in the

future, can be made more manageable and responsive. At the heart of these

discussions will be proposals to change the voting system in Ministerial

meetings to a simple majority vote; the strengthening of decision making by

the European Commission and other EU institutions; and the enlargement of

the Union to include nations of Central and Eastern Europe.

<p>

It is enlargement that is providing the stimulus to the IGC discussions as

it is apparent in most European capitals that unless decision making is

simplified, future expansion to a Europe of 25 nations will be impossible

and the Union will become unmanageable. The debate is critical to the

future of the Union and implies for some states, such as Germany and the

Netherlands, political reforms that point to the need to move to a more

federalist approach. But whatever happens to the detail during the

negotiations no one should have any doubt that enlargement will proceed. To

do otherwise would be to loose an historic prize for western Europe, namely

its re-consolidation following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the

ending of the cold war. 

<p>

While this is desirable from a European perspective this will create new

uncertainties for the Caribbean. Not only will enlargement cause the EU to

become even more remote from former partners but will also demand the

reconstruction of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and internal

financing so as to accommodate significantly poorer economies of eastern

Europe. Such changes early in the next millennium- now just three years

away - will almost certainly change the nature of the EU's trade

relationship with the Caribbean, even if the WTO and post the Lom&#233; debate

do not.

<p>

The final shape of the IGC proposals, or the highly contentious issue of

European Monetary Union (EMU) the criteria for which have to be met this

year by  EU member states, will lead to a new balance of power in Europe.

In this regard the position taken by the Anglophone Caribbean's traditional

friend in Europe, the United Kingdom may well determine whether it becomes

an outsider in the European debate.

<p>

A general election is expected by May 1 in Britain and it seems

increasingly probable that the outcome may well be determined by the

position the two main parties take on  future relations with Europe.

Politics aside, this will have a direct and indirect term impact on the

Caribbean's future relations with Europe.

<p>

The signs are that the Conservative government, which has opposed changes

to future EU voting in Council meetings, any further strengthening of the

Commission and has fudged the question of membership of the EMU, is likely

to take a strident anti- European posture during the election campaign.

This means that if the present Conservative Government were to win again,

it may well have alienated most of its colleagues in Europe just at the

moment the Caribbean will need its support and leadership on a post Lom&#233;

relationship. This may be compounded by the fact that a future Conservative

government is likely to be dominated by a new intake of  young right of

centre Conservative members dedicated to an Atlanticist approach, the

introduction further market oriented policies that for example see no role

for preference and the semi-detachment of the UK from its European

neighbours. 

<p>

Alternatively a Labour win may well make Britains role in Europe a central

part of its foreign relations strategy and as a part of this a position of

leadership on a post Lom&#233; accord. However, not only is this less certain if

Britain's membership of the Union comes to dominate the election campaign,

but no one in the region should have any illusions that new Labour's

policies will be pragmatic and like its Conservative counterpart, aimed at

ensuring a secure Europe.

<p>

European Governments, the European Parliament, the European Commission and

most others return to their offices on January 6 after a long Christmas and

New Year's break.  Pressing issues that will be back on the daily agenda

include: the WTO and bananas; proposed safeguard measures to limit ACP

Caribbean rice exports;  relations with Cuba; the Helms Burton

legislation; the development of the debate on a post Lom&#233; relationship; and even the obscure matter of  how to establish a nomenclature for Trinidad lake asphalt. But it will be a wider range of positions emerging, as the year proceeds, from the inter-European debate that will determine the real shape of the Caribbean's future  relationship with Europe.

<h3>PEACE MOVES AS WATER DISPUTES HEAD FOR BOIL</h3>
<i>
If wars over water become common next century, as environmental doomsters 
predict, the Nile basin is a possible troublespot. The basin's 10 countries, 
reports <b>Gemini News Service</b>, are taking the first steps to sort out their 
conflicting demands.<p>


By <b>CRESPO SEBUNYA</b>,<br>
Kampala </i><hr><p>


A new World Bank report on the dangers of water conflicts in North Africa and 
the Middle East comes in the wake of a conference that spotlighted the Nile 
basin as a potential flashpoint.<p>

The Bank's recipe for averting "looming crisis" is a reduction of subsidies, 
greater efficiency in irrigation and diversion of water away from low-value 
agriculture towards cities and people.<p>

It looks to investment of up to $60 billion in the North Africa-Middle East 
region over the next decade. This, it says, would increase water supplies by 50 
per cent and avoid disputes.<p>

Dispute-avoidance was also the underlying concern of the Nile waters 
conference.<p>

Within hours of the opening of the Kampala meeting, a Ugandan participant 
accused Egypt of acting like colonial masters determined to preserve the status 
quo regardless of the interests of sub-Saharan Africa: "I think we are entitled 
to some form of compensation," he said.<p>

His charge was based on arguments that Egypt and Sudan consume an unfairly 
large amount of the river's waters after being given the right by colonial 
Britain to veto all major developments along the Nile, which Egypt regards as 
its lifeblood.<p>

When Ethiopia announced a plan to divert water from the river in the 1980s, 
for example, Cairo threatened military retaliation. The proposal was dropped 
immediately.<p>

The veto policy, explained Egyptian legal scholar Dr Aziza Fahmi, stemmed from 
the view that the North African states were more dependent on the river than 
were African countries with their rain-fed agriculture: "This created servitude 
in favour of Egypt as against the upper riparian states," said Dr Fahmi.<p>

But economic development in all 10 countries in the Nile basin - Burundi, 
Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire - is 
placing increasing demands on all available water resources.<p>

"The Nile is a gift from God for all of us," said Uganda's Water and Natural 
Resources Minister Henry Kajura. "Every country has a right to use the 
resource, and no country should have veto power over the rest and hinder their 
beneficial use of the resource."<p>

Uganda's concern for the river has grown because of climatic changes. "We are 
all concerned by the recent climate trends," said Kajura. "We have been 
experiencing recurrent drought which tends to be more severe and prolonged and 
which, coupled with poor environmental management and rising population, is 
making the Ugandan environment increasingly fragile and threatening the social 
livelihood of the people."<p>

Uganda criticises Egypt for sticking to those parts of historic agreements 
that are in its favour, but ignoring other aspects of river-sharing, such as 
compensating Uganda for its role as a reservoir for the Nile waters.<p>

Not all conflicts are between sub-Saharan and Arab countries, although that 
ethnic divide is potent. Last year, some Kenyans said that expansion of 
Uganda's Owen Falls dam had caused a drop in the level of Lake Victoria, 
affecting water supplies to several Kenyan towns.<p>

Denying the allegation, Ugandan officials attributed the drop in the lake to 
the rapid spread of the water hyacinth which, they said, was increasing 
evaporation rates.<p>

To sort out such disputes, an International Nile Basin Association is being 
established.<p>

"We hope the headquarters will be functioning fully with a secretariat before 
the end of 1998," said P. Kahangire, chairman of the conference organising 
committee and Uganda's Director of Water Development.<p>

A technical committee is already in existence, charged with helping countries 
make effective and equitable use of the river's waters.<p>

The 10 countries have been asked to draw up national water action plans for 
integration in the proposed $100 million Nile Basin Development Plan, which is 
currently unfunded.<p>

"It is an ambitious project," admitted Fathy El Gamal, water resources planner 
for the technical committee. But he expressed optimism over the commitment of 
the governments concerned.<p>

To achieve real results, economic cooperation may be needed, and that has 
proved elusive in the past.<p>

Egyptian diplomats in Kampala say their country is considering ways of cutting 
water use. One suggestion is for Egypt to reduce its grain output and increase 
imports from countries up-river, while stepping up industrial production and 
exports to its near neighbours. But the conference was also told that Egypt has 
plans for irrigating a further 1.5 million hectares of land.<p>

Another proposal up for consideration is that Uganda should expand its 
hydropower output. It already supplies electricity to Kenya, Tanzania and 
Rwanda. Zaire and Sudan could theoretically be added to the list of buyers, but 
only if huge political, financial and technical problems can be resolved. <p>

<h1>Emblems of failure</h1> <font size=+1><b><i>by  David Rieff</i></b></font><p>


           Its failure in former Yugoslavia illustrates only too clearly that the UN is out of tune with the world it inhabits. Chances that the rulers will change to fit the reality are, however, slim<p>


The United Nations operation in Croatia is winding down rapidly. Detachment after detachment of peacekeeping troops - Canadians, Jordanians, Kenyans - are being mustered at Split airport, and sent home. Many of them were stationed around Knin, in what was the Serb-secessionist region of the Krajina until Croatia recaptured the territory this August, and if they smile and joke with each other it is in part because they know they are lucky to be alive. The Croatian army was not particularly concerned with the safety of these blue helmets when it launched 'Operation Storm'. They had been useful to the Croatians in 1991, 1992 and 1993, when the Serbs were strong and Croatia unable to do anything against them on the battlefield. But, by the summer of 1995, it was Croatia that had regained the military upper hand. At that point, the buffer of a United Nations peacekeeping force was dispensable, and the Croatian army moved through its lines as contemptuously as the Israeli army had moved through UN lines in South Lebanon in 1981.<p>

	In Bosnia, UN forces are still present but they are almost as irrelevant to the outcomes of both the political negotiations or the military balance. NATO war planes attack Serb positions from the sky. US diplomats shuttle between Washington, Geneva, Sarajevo, Zagreb and Belgrade. It is emblematic that, though nominally under UN command, most of the troops of the so-called Rapid Reaction Force - the heavily armed Anglo-French unit now stationed on Mount Igman overlooking Sarajevo - have declined even to paint their fighting vehicles in UN white. 'White is the colour of surrender,' a French sergeant told me recently.<p>

	What the renewal of peace negotiations in Bosnia under the US aegis, and the commitment of NATO forces both reveal, is what most people who cared to know have understood for a long time: the diplomatic and peacekeeping tracks that have been pursued by and through the UN have never been much more than an intellectually and morally dubious exercise in wishful thinking. Whether UN officials themselves understand this is another matter. At the very moment when Croatian artillery was pounding Knin, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, issued a statement declaring that 'the deliberate reopening of large-scale conflict flouts the ceasefire that has provided the opportunity to search for a peaceful settlement.'<p>

	This statement is breathtaking in the number of ways it misleads. It might give someone who has not followed events in the former Yugoslavia the impression that before the Croatian attack, UN negotiators had been making significant progress toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In reality, there had been no progress. On the contrary, the Croatian Serbs were as committed as ever to the idea of a Great Serb state whose borders would run from Croatia through Bosnia to Serbia proper, while the Croatian government remained adamant that the Krajina had to revert to Croatian control. The one peace plan that had shown some promise earlier - the so-called Z-4 plan initiated by the US ambassador to Zagreb, Peter Galbraith - had already been rejected by the Knin Serbs.<p>

And yet whether it was out of genuine antipathy toward the Croatian government, or sympathy for the Krajina Serbs, or simply the sense, expressed to me recently by a senior UNHCR official that 'all three sides [in the conflict] are abominable', UN officials kept insisting all the way up to the beginning of Operation Storm that in time there would be a peaceful resolution. They did so despite knowing that there was no common ground between the belligerents and that, leaving politics aside, Croatia's economic future depended on removing the threat of Serb guns less than 20 kilometres from its tourist resorts along the Dalmatian coast. The current situation was temporary, UN officials insisted.<p>

	But it is a commonplace that in the Balkans, temporary political arrangements have a way of becoming permanent, particularly when, as has been the case since 1991 in the former Yugoslavia, they are accompanied by ethnic cleansing. A UN brokered ceasefire may seem like the first step in the process to the UN, but to the belligerent on the ground who benefits from it, it is in fact the only step. As a Croatian friend, an opponent of the Tudjman regime, put it to me recently: 'I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. The UN thinks the Cyprus ceasefire, which has lasted 30 years, is a big success. As far as Boutros-Ghali is concerned, success is measured not by a  final settlement but by the sole yardstick of keeping the guns silent. It would not have bothered them at all if we had all gone on talking for 10 years.'<p>

	And UN officials in Zagreb, Sarajevo and New York, though they might quarrel with the tone of this remark, do not in fact disagree. Theirs, they have argued since 1991, is a peacekeeping mission. The rights and wrongs of the conflict are not their concern. Croats, Krajina Serbs, Bosnians, Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Serbs, these are all just 'parties' to the conflict, or, to use the term of art still favoured by UN military briefers, 'warring factions'. Such impartiality, they insist, is indispensable to any successful peacekeeping operation. And what they are talking about, of course, is, more than anything else, the delivery of humanitarian aid. For if the UN is to succeed in getting such aid to all parties and, in many cases, cross battle lines to do so, they must remain on good terms with all sides. Moral judgements are for others to make.<p>

	In making this argument, the UN has fallen into both a practical and a moral trap. This is why one of the most important outcomes of the war in the former Yugoslavia has been a radical weakening of both the prestige and legitimacy of  the UN in the minds of many who, until the war began, were disposed to side with the world body against its detractors. On the practical level, what the Yugoslav tragedy should make clear, at the very least, is that no humanitarian effort can ever be a substitute for political engagement. It may even be that at the present time humanitarian engagement is the emblem of political failure, not just in the former Yugoslavia, but in Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and Kurdistan as well.<p>

	Certainly, the notion that a relief effort, no matter how massive or well publicised, can ever suffice on its own is ludicrous. On the contrary, when such efforts are not closed down precipitously, as recently in the case of Rwanda, but instead are prolonged indefinitely, they risk taking on a life of their own without ever addressing the root causes of the conflict. A good example of this is the relief effort in Sudan, Operation Lifeline Sudan, originally undertaken to prevent a famine. It has been going on for more than six years now; and the danger of famine has passed. But it is perpetuated because it has been judged, at least by those who fund and administer it, to be a success story. No-one wants to confront the possibility that by giving the world an out - governments can say that something is being done - the sufferings of the Sudanese people are in fact being prolonged.<p>

	As Alex de Waal has pointed out in the Sudanese case - and it applies to Bosnia as well - complex humanitarian operations also contribute in important ways to the war efforts of the belligerents. They don't have to worry about feeding their people as long as the international community will do it. And since aid is now a business, and the survival in funding terms of individual aid organisations depends on their presence in various zones of war and calamity, nations or rebel groups can effectively blackmail these aid agencies into helping them, on almost any terms.<p>

	In Bosnia and Croatia, these institutional deformations have been one facet of the larger deformation that the concept of strict impartiality wrought on the UN operation. For UN officials, securing peace on no matter what terms was always a victory; and their resort to war, no matter how justifiable in terms either of morality or national interest, was always a defeat. There was never a sense, in UN pronouncements, that it might be important to make a distinction between a just and an unjust peace. How could there have been? The UN in Croatia and Bosnia did not see itself as principally obliged to uphold, if only verbally, the ideals of the UN Charter, but rather the mandate of the Security Council. And that, they insisted rightly, was to provide humanitarian aid and diplomatic mediation. As the Secretary-General's Special Representative in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, has often done: 'Yes, I have my moral judgements, but I have my role as a go-between... All international peace-keepers and mediators have to be impartial.'<p>

Obviously, one of Bosnia's misfortunes has been that the UN Secretariat under Boutros-Ghali operated under the conceit that the Charter is more or less whatever the permanent members of the Security Council interpret it to be in a relevant resolution. 'Pharaoh', as he is called by dissident UN officials in New York, is not only no Hammarsjkold, he is not even a Perez de Cuellar. Of course, Pharaoh's time will pass. The question, after Bosnia, is how much of the moral legitimacy upon which, when all is said and done, the UN's effectiveness and perhaps even its survival depends, will be left? On the ground in the former Yugoslavia, UN officials have taken refuge in the idea that none of this is their fault and that they have simply been whipping boys for the international community's refusal to act. And they are right in the sense that they are not the sole architects of the international failure.<p>

	But, though they like to pretend otherwise, they have not just been innocent, powerless bystanders either. They could have spoken out; with a few exceptions, usually people temporarily rather than permanently employed by the UN like the Special Rapporteur for Human Rights, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, they chose to remain silent. Perhaps the cynicism about politics engendered by 40 years of being hamstrung by the superpower rivalry got the better of them. Whatever the reason, odd though it may be to say about an institution whose principal constituent element is the nation state, the UN in the former Yugoslavia revealed itself to be most comfortable thinking in anti-political terms. To hear Yasushi Akashi, Boutros-Ghali's Special Representative talk, the war had three categories: political and military elites - always bad - civilians - always innocent - and peace keepers - always well-intentioned.<p>

	This is a lovely, if somewhat self-serving, idea. But it happens to be wrong, and the UN's allegiance to it reveals a great deal about why it went so wrong in the former Yugoslavia. For the truth, uncomfortable though it may be to admit, is that most civilians on all sides of the confrontation line supported their political leaders. Indeed, what is remarkable about the war has been the degree of consent the political elites have garnered from their populations. Even Radovan Karadzic, alas, does not rule by terror. Most Serbs believe his arguments. Whether this is an example of 'false consciousness' or the deleterious effect of the media is irrelevant in this context. The fact is that the distinctions between leaders and populations upon which the UN has based is policy are false.<p>

	Small wonder then that the policies themselves have gone so disastrously wrong. The UN resented being deployed in the former Yugoslavia, and rightly blame the member states of this improper use of peacekeeping. But its officials could never get a grip on what was actually going on, either in moral or in practical terms. As a result, they misjudged the resolve of the Bosnian government, whose surrender in 1992 and 1993 the UN desperately tried to encourage; they misjudged the willingness of the Bosnian Serbs to negotiate seriously, insisting on the signing of each successive, soon to be proved worthless agreement, that this time the Bosnian Serbs were sincere; and, of course, they misjudged the resolve of the Croatian government to reconquer the secessionist Krajina.<p>

	What is worse, the UN seems to have learned nothing from its mistakes. To listen to UN officials, from the Secretary-General annoyed that he has had to spend so much time on Bosnia when there are so many other pressing problems, on down, it is easy to get the impression that the UN believes that it is the real victim in the Yugoslav tragedy. No significant UN official has publicly questioned the reliance on impartiality or any of the other principal modalities of peacekeeping, even though it can be argued that a genocide took place in Bosnia and that to be impartial between those who commit a genocide and those who are murdered is morally outrageous. All the UN has been willing to do is insist that the Bosnian deployment was inappropriate, since there was never any peace to keep in the Balkans.<p>

	Now, in the autumn of 1995, the UN role is so drastically diminished that, whatever the outcome of the Bosnian tragedy, UN peacekeepers and UN humanitarian agencies on the ground will play an ever more subsidiary role. NATO soldiers have usurped their military function, and the bilateral aid promised by the USA to Bosnia in return for accepting partition, will, in all likelihood, usurp the humanitarian function. It would be nice to think that the end of this UN intervention would provoke reflection in New York and Geneva. But if the current mood among UN officials is any guide, this seems unlikely to happen.<p>

	It is not that the world the UN wanted, either in Bosnia, or, for that matter, at events like the Women's Conference in Beijing, is not preferable to what exists or what, in the Bosnian case, people on the ground themselves opted for. But, to paraphrase Brecht's ironic verse at the time of the East German uprising of 1953 about the rulers needing to change the people, the UN will sooner or later have to confront the fact that while it may have 'outgrown' war, and think nationalism a crude and ridiculous motivation, in many parts of the world - perhaps in most - people crave justice, even at the price of war, and identify themselves with the nations and ethnicities to which they belong. It would be nice to believe otherwise, but it is an illusion, and to insist upon it after Bosnia is a moral blunder as well as a practical one. <p>

This chapter summarises in very broad terms the main characteristics and trends that can be observed

in the

description of development cooperation policies and administrative structures as the main environment

in which

advisory institutions have to operate. Secondly, the various advisory boards or councils encountered

are

summarised in several categories, and discussed per category. Third, an overview is given of

possibilities for

cooperation between these institutions. The choice between given alternatives and/or realisation of

these

possibilities, depends very much on the outcome of the subsequent discussions on this report. Within

the current

changing  circumstances, the observations that are made here are mainly points for discussion rather

than

recommendations.

<p>

<hr><a name="trends"><h3>Characteristics and Trends in Policies and Administrative

Structures</h3></a>

<p>

The main characteristic that can be observed from the 17 country reports is their wide range of

variations in all

relevant aspects. A number of these differences dates back to historical situations, from which several

countries are

presently emerging (Portugal, Spain, Austria). All countries have to deal with a current changing

international

political situation that brings new problems and focal points for international cooperation to the fore:

environmental degradation, conflicts and peacekeeping, aid to the Central and Eastern European

Countries (CEEC)

and the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union and reception of immigrants.

Moreover nearly all

donor countries face domestic economic constraints. Regardless of old or new policies, focal points,

a too familiar

ghost keeps haunting developing countries: poverty.

<p>

The main differences between the 17 European countries can be observed in the following areas:

<ul>

<li>general aid objectives and their historical background;

<li>the balance between numbers of officially stated objectives and priorities,  available means and

actual

disbursements;

<li>aid targets as well as the actual disbursed volume of aid;

<li>the composition of aid such as emergency aid, and commercial orientation;

<li>instruments and channels such as multi- and bilateral ratio, and channelling through NGOs;

<li>the level of detail to which general objectives are operationalised into separate sector- and country

guidelines,

policies for cross-cutting issues such as WID and the environment;

<li>the forms of political responsibility for development cooperation, policy coordinating authority,

and the

administrative organisation of aid;

<li>aid procedures, including those for evaluation and feedback;

<li>the importance that is attached to policy dialogue with recipient countries and the responsibilities

that are

shared with them, which are strongly related to the decentralisation of implementation;

<li>the number of documents on general policies, White Papers, Strategies, country and sector

policies, and

evaluations in which official policies are described, published and made available to the public. 

</ul>

<p>

Regardless of their present type of development cooperation policy and their actual modes of

implementation, all

donor countries have to find a new coherence, both within the framework of development cooperation

policy as

well as between development policy and other policy areas, notably foreign, domestic and economic

affairs. At the

same time they have to find a new balance between stated objectives and required means. All countries

are in

different stages of this re-orientation process. In a number of countries these changes have led to

administrative re-organisations. The main points of difference are summarised below.

<p>

As far as can be observed from government Strategies, White papers and general Policy Papers, in 11

countries

major policy changes can seen to have taken place over the past four years, that will be continued

during the

coming years, in Denmark, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Portugal, Finland,

Sweden, UK and

Switzerland. In 8 of the 11 countries these major policy changes are directly related to efforts for the

integration of

new tasks into 'traditional' areas of development cooperation, in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands,

Norway,

Finland, Sweden, UK and Switzerland. In this process the integration of Agenda 21 has advanced

farthest. In 3 of

the 11 countries adjustments are, till now, mainly related to surpassing historical constraints (in Spain,

Austria,

Portugal, and to a certain extent in Italy). In a majority of the 11 countries, major policy changes were

accompanied

by re-organisations in the aid administration. In 3 countries no major policy changes could be observed

(in

Germany, France, Luxembourg), while in another 2 countries only administrative changes were, or

are,

implemented (in Belgium, Italy). The situation in Greece is largely unknown. 

<p>

Apparently in a number of countries budget cuts are implemented without major changes in policy.

In the majority

of the 17 countries, decentralisation of aid implementation - for instance: policy dialogue and the

sharing of

responsibilities with developing countries - as a central feature of administering aid can be observed.

In at least 2

countries relationships with development countries are entered into on a basis of mutual responsibility

for each

other's development. The Netherlands and Switzerland established relations in which recipient

countries, for

instance advice on measures for the realisation of the donor country's national goals for sustainable

development. 

<p>

In Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Finland, Sweden, the UK and Switzerland

White Papers,

Strategies and comprehensive Policy Papers on development cooperation in the 1990s, including an

emphasis on

the integration of Agenda 21 and sustainable development have been written in the last three years,

in addition to

the usual Annual Plans, Annual Reports and Explanations on the Budgets that some countries

produce. Studies on

Agenda 21 include both consequences for developing countries and for development cooperation, as

well as the

consequences of sustainable development for donor countries. In particular in Denmark, Ireland, the

Netherlands,

Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom and Switzerland the sustainable development issue has been

integrated in

cooperation policies, and is linked to their own national environmental plans. 

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3>



In 11 countries a Minister or a State Secretary is responsible for development cooperation (Belgium,

Denmark,

Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, UK). In 6 of these

11 countries

the Minister is a full member of the Cabinet. To compare: in 1992 out of the 20 member states of the

DAC 8 had a

Minister of  Development Cooperation that held a full Cabinet position. Allocations of responsibilities

and

coordinating authorities vary greatly. In these 11 countries there is a separate form of governmental

organisation for

policy formulation and implementation of official development cooperation, or for parts of it. In most

cases the

responsible directorates are located within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2 of the 11 countries

implementing

agencies are located outside the administration (Norway, Sweden). In the majority of countries

development

cooperation is distributed over several ministries, agencies and institutions. Some are still traditionally

structured,

some organised on the basis of new concepts and tasks. Internal and external coordination of policy

formulation

and implementation is difficult and time consuming. In the majority of countries the government aid

organisation

has been re-organised several times, initiated mostly by changes in the domestic political situation and

in a few

cases as a direct consequence of changes in the content of development cooperation policies.

<p>

Since 1980/81, and more significantly since 1989, ODA volumes in nearly all of the 17 countries have

decreased.

In 1992/93 the ODA GNP ratio of 12 countries was below the international target of 0.7 per cent and

the ratios of 4

countries were above this target (1 unknown). In 1990 ODA of 11 of the 17 countries (1 unknown)

was already

below the average of the EU member states of 0.51 per cent of GNP. In 11 countries budget cuts are

projected for

the years after 1993, in 4 countries none are planned (Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, Austria), and

in 2 countries

plans are unknown (Greece and Portugal). Costs for peacekeeping, for aid to the CEECs and the NIS,

for the

reception of immigrants and refugees have been kept mainly outside ODA. Nevertheless the need for

a re-ordering

of all 'external assistance costs' is growing, while the discussion for an up-date of the familiar definition

of ODA

continues. At the same time the call for more attention to domestic economic interests within

development

cooperation policies becomes louder. Multilateral contributions to the EU, UN- and World Bank

institutions grew

fastest. These contributions are likely to continue to increase, at the expense of bilateral aid to

developing

countries, in a time of constant or decreasing total aid budgets. Paraphrasing a question posed by the

Finnish

NGOs, one could ask: 'What is there left to defend Europe's ODA?' 

<p>

Concluding: 17 European countries are searching for new forms of coherence and coordination of new

policies and

instruments, in changing circumstances, still supported by the public, and with apparently less funds. 

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

Advisory Councils and other advisory structures vary as widely as the above summarised policy and

administrative

environment. This paragraph describes some general characteristics, and elaborates successively

mandate and actual

functioning, size and membership, independence, and subject areas covered. The description cannot

be complete in

all detail, since for some countries (notably Greece) and on some points data are lacking; for instance

on the

subjects discussed by councils that mainly have an internal advising function within the Ministry of

Development

Cooperation. Finally, some general observations are made. Figures elaborated in this survey point to

general

indications and directions of observed developments and trends. 

<p>

In this survey several types of Advisory Structures and Mechanisms are described. These are 'Formal

Advisory

Institutions'. Advisory Councils for Development Cooperation that are installed by the Government

and that have

the explicit mandate to advise the Government, through one of its Ministers, on matters of

development cooperation

policy. Not taking into account other characteristics, such as actual functions, procedures, right of

initiative.

'Policy' is defined here as general development policy excluding specific policies for sectors or

countries. A

Council is classified in this category when at least its mandate permits it to advise on general policy

questions; in

practice it may also cover other areas, for instance a Council may comment on annual reports or

contribute to the

specification of the budget. These include the institutions described under the second paragraphs

headed 'Formal

Advisory Institutions'. In these countries other organisations, structures and mechanisms that might

contribute to or

influence advising on development cooperation policy, are described in the third paragraphs, 'Other

Actors'. They

are not covered in the following summary. 

<p>

In countries where no such Formal Advisory Institution for policy advice exists, all advisory activities

are described

in the second paragraphs of the country descriptions, headed 'Advisory Structures and Mechanisms'. 

<p>

For completeness sake, attention in the country reports has been given to commercial consultancy

services for

implementation of development activities that may influence general development policy. However,

these activities

are excluded from the following summary. This leads to the observation that in the majority of the 17

countries

more policy advisory activities are carried out than the objective of this survey allows to describe.

Formal Advisory

Councils are only one group of several producers of policy advice.

<p>

<h3>Table I: An overview of Formal Advisory Institutions and their structure or status</h3>

<p>

8 formal advisory institutions (board and/or council) in:

<ol>

<li>Denmark,  since 1971 (a Board and a Council)

<li>Germany, since 1963 (a Scientific Council)

<li>Ireland, since 1994 (first Council installed in 1979 )

<li>Italy, since 1987

<li>The Netherlands, snce 1964, (to be abolished in 1997)

<li>Austria, since 1974

<li>Finland, since 1992 (first Council installed in 1979)

<li>Switzerland, since 1976

</ol>

<p>

1 Board of a limited mandate, in:

<ol>

<li>Sweden, since 1965 (a separate Council is installed for each aid agency)

</ol>

<p>

In 2 countries Councils are about to be installed:

<ol>

<li>Spain, planned by the government

<li>Portugal, requested by groups in society

</ol>

<p>

2 Councils have been abolished in:

<ol>

<li>Belgium, since 1962 (abolished in 1985, although not officially )

<li>Norway, since 1968(abolished in 1989)

</ol>

<p>

In 2 countries policy advisory work is carried out by other institutions or influenced by other

mechanisms:

<ol>

<li>France - many renowned research institutes and other organisations

<li>UK - many renowned research institutes, some government owned

</ol>

<p>

in 1 country no formal advisory institutions and/or other institutes are known:

<ol>

<li>Luxembourg

</ol>

<p>

in 1 country the advisory situation is unknown:

<ol>

<li>Greece - no Council, the contribution of research institutes is unknown

</ol>

<p>

In the 11 countries where a Minister or State Secretary is responsible for development cooperation

policy, 6 have

an Advisory Council, in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland. In 4 of the

11 countries

there is no formal Council, in Belgium (defunct), Norway (abolished), Portugal (requested) and the

UK. In Sweden

several Boards exist, one per aid agency. Sweden is not included in the following description, unless

explicitly

mentioned. Two countries without a Minister or State Secretary of Development Cooperation have

an Advisory

Council, Italy and Switzerland. 

<p>

All 8 Advisory Councils were installed - finally or for the first time - in the same period in which

legislation on

development cooperation was passed and the first governmental administrative institutions were

created, in the

1960s and 1970s. A period, when official development cooperation policy had to be elaborated, and

its support

base -NGOs and voluntary organisations - had to be enlarged in the donor countries. In the

Scandinavian countries,

where a clear distinction exists between relatively small Ministries for policy formulation and larger

agencies for

implementation, a Board as well as a Council for the implementing Agency were established. The

Board (Styrelse)

can be considered a Steering Committee, and the Council (Radet) a Consultative Committee. In

Sweden this is still

the function of the boards at SIDA and the other implementing agencies, BITS, SAREC and

SWEDECORP. One

of the functions of the, now defunct, Belgian Council, certainly was to strengthen the independent

position of the

newly created agency AGCD.

<p>

Generally speaking, the Advisory Councils observed in this survey may be divided into two broad

categories,

according to their official mandates and actual functions:

<ul>

<li>Councils with a primarily consultative function, in Denmark, Italy, Austria, and Finland. The

Council in these

countries serves to inform the administration, as well as Council members and their networks. All 4

Councils meet

in the presence of the Minister or her/his representatives. In Austria the Minister convenes and chairs

the Council's

meetings. Since, among others, Parliamentarians are also Council members (except in Italy),

consensus can be

reached before parliamentary debates take place. None of these Councils publishes results, since these

results are

for internal use only. In practice there are more variations in actual activities. Denmark's Council also

comments on

projects before they are sent to Parliament; the clear intermediating role of Finland's KESU between

Government

and pressure groups in society has been described earlier. In Italy the Council comments on the annual

report on

development cooperation, and in the 1970s the Austrian Council elaborated Austria's Law on

Development

Cooperation into Guidelines for cooperation.

<p>

<li>Councils with mainly an advisory function, in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and

Switzerland. These

Councils firstly advise the Government on general development cooperation policy, on their own

initiative or on the

governments request. Also here distinctions are not clear cut. In Germany the Minister may attend

discussions of

the Beirat, while in the Netherlands the Minister only discusses written recommendations in a special

meeting with

the Council and is officially obliged to respond in writing to the Council and to Parliament. In

Switzerland the

Council also comments on government policy documents before they are sent to Parliament, and meets

in the

presence of SDC officials. In this category, the now defunct Belgian Council might be classified, since

its first task

was to advise the Government on policy formulation. But in addition the Minister was obliged to ask

the Belgian

Council's advice on his annual report on development cooperation, on policy options and on project

proposals of

NGOs.

</ul>

<p>

Judging from the apparent change in composition of the Dutch Council's membership over the years),

one might

conclude that changes in the principal function of one and the same Council occur; in this example a

change from a

primarily consultative to a mainly advising function.

<p>

It can be observed that the actual realisation of a mandate very much depends on the position and

initiatives of a

Council's members. Secondly, a Council actually combines the function of 'consultative committee'

and that of

'advisory council'. The last observation is supported by the fact that actual Council membership is

based both on

expertise and representation. A construction which might influence the technical contents of

recommendations and

reports, and the speed with which they are produced. 

<p>

Of the 8 Councils, 3 Councils have a membership of less than 20 persons (Ireland, Finland - the

smallest Council

with 10 members - and Switzerland). The German Council has 25 members, while 4 countries have

Councils with

45 members or more: in Denmark (the largest Council with 75 members), Italy, the Netherlands and

Austria.

SIDA's Board in Sweden has 14 members and the Belgian Council used to have 14 and later 35

members. Small or

large, actual representativity of Councils' membership is high, even in Councils of which the members

are

appointed on criteria of expertise and personal capacities. For instance in the Netherlands, the NAR

membership is

based on expertise, but should also include as many sections of Dutch society as possible.

<p>

The Councils in Denmark, Austria and Switzerland have the greatest variety in membership

composition, followed

by (Belgium), Italy, and Finland, then by Ireland and the Netherlands. The German Council has the

most

homogeneous composition and purest scientific character. Trade unions and the business community

tend to be

underrepresented. Councils with a primarily consultative function, include members from the official

development

cooperation administration in (Belgium), Denmark, Italy, Austria and Finland. In Denmark Council

meetings may

also be attended by the press. Three of these Councils also have Parliamentarians among their

members, in

Denmark, Austria and Finland. This underlines their consultative function. In the Netherlands official

contacts on

behalf of the Council with members of Parliament are currently maintained by the Presidium of the

Council, and

have an informative function about the general position of the Council only. Except for the Council

in Austria, the

other 7 Councils have the right of initiative. They select subjects for discussion and write

recommendations. They

bring matters of their choice to the attention of the Minister. 

<p>

Five Councils have their own secretariat that is located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These are

the two

'consultative councils' in Denmark and Finland, and the three 'advisory councils' in Ireland, the

Netherlands and

Switzerland. The secretaries are officials of the Ministry except in Ireland where the Secretary is

directly contracted

by the Council. Secretaries of the former Finnish Councils were sometimes located outside the

Ministry. 

<p>



In Germany the Council can be contacted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in Austria

through the

Federal Chancellery. As far as is known the Secretariats of the Councils in Denmark, the Netherlands,

Finland and

Switzerland are located in the Policy Planning Unit of the development cooperation administration

within the

MFA. Details of feedback procedures of Councils' discussions and reports to- or through these Units

are unknown,

except for the Netherlands. Generally speaking, they vary greatly, according to the appreciation by

Ministers of the

results of the Council's activities. The fate of the now defunct Belgium Council is a point in case.  

<p>

Councils in Ireland and the Netherlands have their own budgets, provided by the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs. The

Councils in Germany and Finland have to submit a funding request for each activity to the Ministry.

In the

Netherlands and in Finland,  Councils may have research conducted on their behalf and organise

conferences and

seminars for a wider public. This was also the case with the Belgian Council. In Germany the Ministry

sometimes

decides to publish the reports of the Council. In the Netherlands reports by the Council are always

published (in

several languages). The Irish Council can do so in consultation with the Ministry. Working procedures

of the

Councils seem to be farthest elaborated and formalised in the Netherlands.

<p>

From the foregoing it can be observed that Councils in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Finland

have the

most independent relation with their respective Governments, followed by Denmark, Italy,

Switzerland, and last,

Austria. Evidently, this observation does not take into account the variations that doubtless occur,

based on

personal initiatives.         

<p>

Policy areas and subjects that are and were covered by Councils are difficult to describe, since only

three Councils

have the means to publish results of their work. The Netherlands' Council publishes its

recommendations and other

studies; the German Council publishes some of its results. Publications of the present Irish Council

are not yet

known. In most countries results of discussions are for internal use only. However, subject-areas that

were and are treated, are amongst others:

<ol>

<li>General development cooperation policy: WID, migrants and refugees, development cooperation

in the 1990s,

public support for development cooperation, industrial and agriculture development, comments on

reports of

international organisations such as DAC, UNDP and World Bank. Agenda 21 after UNCED 1992

appears to be the

most frequently studied and discussed issue in the past few years. Current agenda's of several Councils

include

discussions on the coming UN Worldconference on Population, the UN Worldconference on Women

and on the

World Social Summit. Although broad in their analyses, these studies are oriented towards the

formulation of

national positions for those occasions.<p>

<li>Specific areas and issues include: comments on annual reports, budgets, project proposals,

specific policy papers, national aid instruments and channels for aid, procedures and guidelines;

</ol>

<p>

Apparently in only one country, Finland, the Council has contributed directly to the Government's

most recent

Strategy Paper (1993), 'Finland's Development Cooperation in the 1990s'. While Agenda 21 is both

on the agenda

of several Governments and on the agenda of several Councils, it seems doubtful whether the two have

actually

met.

<p>

<h3>Further Observations</h3>

<p>

From the foregoing summary a number of very tentative observations can be made.

<ul>

<li>Regardless of their actual consultative or advisory functions, Councils appear to have been most

influential in

the period when development cooperation was yet unexplored and expertise had to be built up. In

several countries

Councils were abolished when the administration had acquired expertise, when support for

development activities

was secured, and when advice could be bought through less complicated procedures from consultants,

specialised

institutes and NGOs. However, current international circumstances appear to create similar

opportunities for

Councils, as in the 1960s and 1970s. The current changes in international relations, again create areas

where new

policies can be explored. Globalisation and regionalisation processes have consequences for: financial

systems,

sustainable development in the traditional 'recipient' and 'donor' countries, technology and

environment, social and

economic reforms, economic development and human rights, security, arms and conflict, economic

dualism,

government policies and private enterprise, population, contents of development cooperation policy

and foreign

policy, etc. Leaving the smaller and more traditional issues, Councils could concentrate on the

coherence of these

policy areas. They could fulfil again an intermediating task between Governments, policy makers, and

scientific

communities as well as related sections of society. 

<p>

<li>The world anno 1994 probably requires a consistent shift of perspective in all activities that

concern relations

between groups of people. The international perspective could replace the traditional national one, in

which the

point of departure could be shared responsibilities with developing countries. This required change

of perspective

might be of the same importance, as was the transition from a colonial order to a cooperation structure,

to which

councils and other advisory or consultative structures and mechanisms have contributed in the past.

<p>

<li>The degree of 'Euro-content' of Councils' activities could certainly be raised. Not only as far as

the number of

activities on specific European issues is concerned, but firstly by the inclusion of the European

dimension in each

study and recommendation. 

<p>

<li>These changes could be facilitated by a number of practical measures, to be derived from the

above described

experiences:

<ul>

<li>the acquisition of a relative independent position appears to enhance a Council's productivity;

<li>a minimum amount of formally regulated procedures, amongst others for operating, feedback

mechanisms, and

secretarial support, is required;

<li>publication of results, studies and recommendations is probably a conditio sine qua non for

participating

effectively in policy debates;

<li>enlarging the accessibility of studies and reports through translations into relevant languages is

an obvious

measure in 'our global village';

<li>inclusion of relevant domestic expertise, as well as expertise from the South, and from 'Brussels'

supports an

international and European approach and quality;

<li>the consultative function could be more clearly separated from the advisory function. Why not

delegate the first

function to the existing 'Committees for Development Education', already concentrate in some

countries on

development cooperation  nd sustainable development? They also are changing their perspective;

<li>a budget would create more possibilities for councils to organise seminars, workshops and have

research

conducted and establish contacts;

<li>Secretariats could integrate the international and European dimension in their work by allocating

some of their

time to these activities, if only by maintaining international contacts;

<li>secretariats could organise meetings with representatives from the EC and other relevant

international

institutions and with partner Councils.

<li>Councils appear to have been established on the initiative of Governments, and seem to have gone

up and down

with administrative reforms. They could find ways to create their own, scientific base of support in

their societies

and through international contacts. For instance, contacts by Councils as a whole or by the Secretariats

could be

institutionalised with research communities and institutes, and international data-bases could be used. 

<li>Networking experiences of NGOs and Universities could be used here. Besides the

EC-NGO-Liaison

Committee and the numerous other NGO-networks, one could mention the 'Joint Planning Committee'

between

NGOs and Governments that was established in 1993 in Paris. Also, the cooperation between the

Evaluation Units

for Development Cooperation from several donor countries could be instructive. Within and without

the DAC,

several of these Units conduct joint evaluations, for instance of the World Food Programme, the EU-

Food Aid

Programme, the Regional Development Banks and a planned evaluation of the EDF.

<li>A flexible model such as the Finnish Council might enhance the topicality of a Council's work.

The KESU in

Finland is installed for a limited period and receives a specific mandate for each new term. 

</ul></ul>

<p>

A short remark should be made about the situation in France and the UK on the one hand and in Spain

and

Portugal on the other. In the first two countries numerous 'other advisory structures and mechanisms'

are present in

many broad as well as specific areas, without an apparent need to create more formalised advisory

institutions for

development cooperation. In Spain and Portugal, perhaps supplemented by Belgium, there is a wish

- from different

quarters though - to organise the available expertise for development cooperation, into some sort of

advisory or

consultative structure. Institutions in both groups of countries may profit from the here described

experiences,

when they want to decide upon their course for further cooperation in this area. 

<p>

<hr><a name="poss"><h3>Possibilities for Cooperation in Europe</h3></a>

<p>

The EC has shown interest in the efforts of several Councils to establish some form of cooperation

between

advisory councils for development cooperation policy. Representatives of the EC attended the 1991

Workshop in

the Hague and in June and December 1993 DG VIII organised two one day meetings on Coherence

of EU-Development Cooperation Policies, that were also attended by representatives of several of the

here mentioned

institutions. However, the DG VIII focuses on ad hoc cooperation with a group of individual experts

for policy

development in specific areas, rather than on establishing more structured or organised forms of

cooperation.

Notwithstanding this difference in focus, contacts and cooperation with the EC should be maintained,

and

approaches should be developed that connect with the European level of policy formulation. 

<p>

Recent EU-related discussions include several useful suggestions for the direction of any future

cooperation

between advisory structures in Europe. With regard to general approaches, inclusion of global issues

and broad

approaches are stressed. For instance, Bossuyt, Laporte and Brigaldino argue, in their discussion of

complementarity, that the EC should limit itself to those areas where it has an added value, such as

macro-economic approaches, policy coordination, or performing the role of think tank. The present

preoccupation with the

implementation of projects should be left to other actors, according to the authors. Faber also stresses

the need for

the study of coherence between areas such as development cooperation, agriculture, trade, environment

and

monetary policies, effectiveness and evaluation of EC policy instruments, on the basis of the

development

cooperation paragraph of the Treaty of Maastricht (art. 130 u). He proposes that the EC introduces

a coherence test.

Broad topics and the coherence between them are mentioned, such as trade, SAP's, good governance,

human rights,

population, Africa, and migration. A report on the position of the Netherlands' Social Economic

Council (SER) in

Europe, also argues that activities of the Council directed towards 'Brussels' should not loose

themselves in short-term details, but should concentrate on fundamental points and main issues.

<p>

In addition to raising the degree of the 'Euro-content' of studies and recommendations by choosing

subjects of

European importance (including studies on the consequences of European measures for Member

States), and by

including the European dimension in reports directed to national Governments, contacts with relevant

institutions

could be helpful. Direct contacts could be established by Councils and their Secretariats with relevant

EC

departments and European umbrella organisations and networks of scientists, researchers and NGOs.

The EC-NGO-Liaison Committee and EADI have already been mentioned, but also contacts with

institutes such as

ECDPM in Maastricht and the North-South Institute in Portugal can be useful.

<p>

As yet there is no 'European Advisory Council for Development Cooperation Policy' , comparable to

the advisory

Social Economic Committee (SEC), that was installed by the Treaty of Rome. An input by advisory

Councils and

other advisory institutions for development cooperation policy into the 'Brussels information

processing

machinery', can contribute to the coherence and coordination of EU development cooperation policy

and to that of

its Member States. However, without a careful pragmatic approach, such a network might be more

of a hindrance

than an asset for effective cooperation. The SEC appears to feel the need for a number of measures for

strengthening its functioning. These measures seem to be related to the above mentioned points with

regard to

national Councils: strengthening independence, institutionalisation of working procedures, clear

criteria for

membership and required and relevant expertise.

<p>

Information on the (former) cooperation of the Councils of Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden

in the 'Nordic

Council' is not conclusive about the actual reason for stopping this cooperation. Perhaps, minds were

too 'like

minded', thereby excluding interesting topics for discussion, or it could not operate independently

enough in order

to be sufficiently creative.  

<p>

The foregoing summary does not generate one exclusive route to one form of cooperation between

advisory

structures in Europe. Depending on the choice of goals, long-term and mid-term, several ways are

open, probably

parallel to each other. The original idea for cooperation pre-supposed the existence of more or less

identical, and

also quite structured advisory councils for development cooperation policy. This 'ideal type' apparently

does not

exist. The 8 - 9 described Councils vary greatly on most essential aspects. In addition, in some

countries any form

of advisory structure is clearly absent. Whatever form any future cooperation will take, it has to take

into account

this variety, at least as a point of departure.

<p>

Theoretically two routes for strengthening European Cooperation could be followed.

<p>

Route I starts with building a structure for cooperation. This approach seems futile and will not create

any

participation. What could it have to offer? The discussions and interviews during this survey did not

find any

enthusiasm for this route. Route II takes as a starting point a pragmatic form of cooperation between

interested

members of councils and other institutions in Europe, which may create in mid-term a network for

practical

cooperation and, in long-term some form of more structured cooperation, if need be. People

interviewed appear

interested in such a, carefully managed, approach. It could start with a relative small nucleus of people

that are

prepared, and have the practical possibilities, to invest in building up cooperation and enlarge the

number of

contacts, gradually.

<p>

The interest for cooperation of people spoken to in 14 countries during this survey, is felt through all

Councils and

institutions. Roughly speaking, people in half of the number of countries visited are prepared to be

involved from

the start in one way or the other. The other half, which is certainly interested, would rather like to wait

for further

developments first. Both groups acknowledge the relevance of cooperation, both for their national and

for their

international functioning. These attitudes support a choice for Route II. Finally, one should be aware

that

cooperation, at least for the time being, actually should be established on commitments of individuals,

since no

Council, or Council member, has a 'European mandate'. 

<p>

In addition to these suggestions, the following practical points of action for enhancing cooperation can

be

proposed. 

<p>

The Council in Germany is prepared to organise a workshop to discuss 1) the results of this survey,

second, 2) a

draft for a joint paper, and 3) possible further steps for cooperation. This workshop might be held later

in 1994

when Germany chairs the EU.

<p>

Cooperation could be initiated by producing joint reports on subjects of common interest. Cooperation

should

produce something of interest to all parties concerned. Members of the Council of Germany, the NAR

of the

Netherlands, the ODI in the UK and the ELO in Portugal expressed their interest and willingness to

prepare a draft

paper for joint discussion. The German Council would be prepared to coordinate matters and produce

a first set-up

for the draft of the joint paper.

<p>

Collection and exchange of information could contribute to the coordination of activities, as well as

to establish

and maintain contacts. A definite interest was expressed in such an exchange. Information might

include subject

areas of work, agenda's, coming reports, events and publications, as well as (changing) procedures.

This report

could serve as a basis. Generally speaking, the information that could be collected during the survey,

consists

mostly of documents that are published by Governments and institutes. It gives little exchangeable

information on

the functioning of advisory Councils and institutes. The majority of the latter type of information was

acquired

during interviews and from internal documents. In fact, policy recommendations were only received

from the

Councils of the Netherlands and Germany. 

<p>

A practical continuation of the present cooperation during this survey, could be the preparation of an

up-dated

edition of this report within the next year.

<p>

Observing the experiences during the survey in the past year, it appears that these efforts need the

regular support

of some sort of focal point, that may function as a liaison between the participants. And, at this stage,

some

encouragement might be needed. An internationally composed steering committee of interested people

could be

installed to coordinate and initiate activities, at however low profile it should operate.

<p>

As indicated in the beginning of this part of the report, the further course of cooperation depends first

and foremost

on the decisions that will be taken by the participants in the coming discussions. The collected material

seems more

than sufficient.

<h3>History and Future of the ACP Group</h3>

<p>

<i>"There is an intra-ACP solidarity even in the absence of concrete common interests shared by the three 

parts"  (African researcher)</i>.

<p>

The creation of the ACP group was related to the United Kingdom's accession to the EEC. Twenty

Commonwealth States in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific were invited to enter into special relations

with the EEC -- along the lines of the association that already existed between the EEC and eighteen

French-speaking African countries (through the Yaound&#233; Conventions).

<p>

These states were all former colonies of EEC Member States. This colonial past provides the foundation

for the "geography" of the future ACP group. While the Lom&#233; Convention was always intended to

cover the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa, the colonial argument was the eligibility criterion for Caribbean

and Pacific States to receive special treatment. This explains why the Lom&#233; Convention has often

been described as a "post-colonial agreement."  

<p>

According to Dieter Frisch, former Director-General at DG VIII, "many Europeans were surprised when

the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries sat down together at the EEC negotiating table in July 1973.

One would have rather expected parallel negotiations to have taken place with the three groups. The

formation of the ACP group - which may appear somewhat artificial - came about as a result of a number

of common problems (sugar), but principally because the Caribbean and Pacific contingent wanted to take

advantage of the bargaining power of Black Africa, which was then quite considerable."

<p>

Twenty years later, and looking to the year 2000, the question could be raised whether the ACP group

is still a viable and effective concept. Does it make sense to keep this grouping together, taking into

account the growing heterogeneity among the regions and countries involved? Can the Lom&#233;

Convention continue to provide special treatment to a specific set of countries or should this geographical

approach be abandoned in favour of equal treatment for all countries with comparable levels of

development? If a new geographical division is sought, what criteria can be used to differentiate future

EU cooperation with the developing world? Can "differentiation" be introduced while preserving the best

principles of the Lom&#233; Convention?

<p>

<H3>Pressures on the "Geography" of Lom&#233;</H3>

<p>

<i>"Would there still be an ACP group if the EU did not provide 14 billion ECU every five years?" 

(European researcher)</i>.

<p>

The question of the geographical coverage of the Lom&#233; Convention (and the continuing existence

of an ACP group) will feature prominently on the agenda in the debate on future ACP-EU cooperation.

Several factors are pushing for a reappraisal of the Lom&#233; geography:

<ul>

<li>Growing heterogeneity of the ACP. The wide diversity of conditions prevailing in the ACP creates

tensions. It is, for instance, increasingly difficult to see what "common interests" tie the 70 ACP countries

together. This tends to weaken their negotiating position towards the EU, while reducing the overall

effectiveness of the ACP institutions. It may also help to explain the limited political leverage of the ACP

in other international fora (such as the WTO, and the Bretton Woods institutions). Representatives from

ACP countries with a good "track record" often express their frustration at the EU lumping them together

with a group of "bad performers."

<p>

<li>EU demands for greater differentiation. "Value for money" concerns led the international donor

community to increasingly differentiate among "categories" of developing countries, using a range of

criteria (such as levels of development and commitment to economic reform). The EU is now keen to also

introduce a greater degree of differentiation (and selectivity) in its cooperation relations. The current

Convention does not cater for this need. It provides, to a large extent, a "standard treatment" to all ACP

countries, regardless of their economic development, governance systems, administrative capacities and

performance. The same trade arrangements apply to the whole group. Only a limited amount of

differentiation exists in financial and technical cooperation (for example, through phased programming). 

<p>

<li>Internal political changes in Europe. The European partner has much evolved since the signing of

the first Lom&#233; Convention. The European Union now has 15 Member States. Newcomers have

generally tended to have little sympathy for the Lom&#233; idea -- which they see as a "post-colonial

relic" and "discriminatory." The planned enlargement of the Union will compound this problem. With the

Treaty of Maastricht, the EU has set out its overall policy on development cooperation. Yet the

Lom&#233; Convention (and the EDF) stands outside this framework. There are now increasing pressures

to integrate Lom&#233; into the overall policy framework and to "budgetise" the EDF (to make it part

of the overall EU budget and procedures). Finally, privileged cooperation with the ACP group as such is

no longer a shared EU foreign policy priority. Member States have different interests, either linked to their

own history (Spain with Latin America), proximity (the South of Europe with the Mediterranean region),

economic interests (South-east Asia) or the fight against poverty (in both Lom&#233; and non-

Lom&#233; countries).

</ul><p>



<H3>Do the ACP Countries want to stay Together?</H3>

<p>

"For political and strategic reasons, the ACP group should be maintained, even when there is a growing

economic distance between the different regions" (Caribbean official).

<p>

Obviously, ACP countries need to decide for themselves whether they want to remain together as a group

in any future cooperation agreement with the EU. During our consultations, a rather ambivalent message

came across. Most people consulted strongly defend the actual configuration of Lom&#233; and the

integrity of the ACP group. In their view, any attempt to "break-up" the geography of Lom&#233; would

weaken the ACP. Those in favour of keeping the ACP group, tend to argue the following:

<ul>

<li>Bargaining power. This was the reason behind the formation of the group and it is still perceived as

a valid argument. The group format "has enhanced the negotiating capacity of individual members and

regions among the ACP in their interactions with the European Commission and the Council." This holds

particularly true for the smaller Caribbean and Pacific islands states. According to many people in the

Caribbean, "the Lom&#233; framework had provided  more bargaining power than the region would have

obtained on its own." In the Pacific, there is a strong perception that the region would "simply slip into

oblivion if it had to deal with the EU as a separate region."   

<p>

<li>Dialogue structure. The consultative mechanisms in the Convention have enabled the Community to

have dialogue and engage in cooperative ventures on common terms with a large section of the developing

world. Splitting-up the group (for example, through region-specific arrangements) would require new

dialogue structures, as well as increased bureaucracy and management capacity at Commission level.

<p>

<li>Intra-ACP cooperation. Even though relations are not always harmonious, artificial barriers have been

removed to some extent and collaboration seems to have been enhanced between various parts of the ACP

(including between Anglophone and Francophone Africa). The broad spread and diversity of the group

has led to "a valuable sharing of experiences, of systems of governments and of cultures." Another reason

invoked to keep the group together was its "vast potential for South-South cooperation" -- although it is

admitted that the record so far had been rather poor.  

<p>

<li>Doubts about discrimination of non-ACP states. While recognising the special treatment enjoyed from

the EU, several people argue that this has not led to major discrimination against non-ACP states with

regard to their exports to European markets (they benefit through the generalisation of trade preferences).

Moreover, EU cooperation with non-ACP least-developed countries far exceed the levels of its cooperation

with many ACP countries.

</ul><p>

At the same time, however, many admit that the "sacred ACP unity" has become "a rather hollow

concept." In their view, it becomes increasingly difficult "to hide away, in such a big an incoherent group,

the huge diversity of interests at stake and the antagonisms between the different countries and regions."

The much heralded bargaining power has not prevented the erosion of the preferential treatment over time.

<p>

Against this background, the question is often raised whether "yet another global negotiation between 70

ACP countries and the EU would be the best way to defend the interests of the different component

elements of the ACP group." In the views of this group, revitalisation of relations with Europe may

require "much more specific regional agreements, based on redefined mutual interests." They argue that

this should not entail the loss of the "spirit of Lom&#233;." As one Caribbean researcher puts it: "history

has its rights and change is by definition incremental; hence, the need to search for greater (regional)

differentiation while safeguarding the overall Lom&#233; umbrella." 

<p>



<H3>Options for Differentiation</H3>

<p>

In this section we look in some detail at the different scenarios that have been proposed with regard to

the future "geography" of Lom&#233; and the related issue of differentiated treatment. Four major options

can be distinguished --                        Preserve the Status Quo, 

                      Extend the Benefits of Lom&#233;,                               Vary the Geometry,  and 

                                Dismantle the ACP:

<p><ul>

<li>Preserve the status quo (with marginal changes). This option makes a clear choice for

continuity. Its proponents argue that the ACP group functions relatively well. It makes little

sense to break up this structure in the absence of alternative arrangements that offer similar

political and institutional benefits to its members. Hence, there should be no major change

to the "geography" of Lom&#233;. A limited number of new members could join the ACP

group (South Africa, Cuba), amongst others to ensure greater (regional) coherence. EU

demands for increased flexibility and differentiation could be accommodated within the

existing framework, either through a diversified use of the instruments for financial and

technical cooperation, or through a refinement of phased programming. From a strategic

point of view, it is quite understandable that many ACP people defend this option. However,

a status-quo proposal is not likely to generate much support at EU level, nor does it offer

solid guarantees against further marginalisation of the ACP group.

<p>

<li>Extend the benefits of Lom&#233;. The idea behind this option is to abandon the

geographical approach in favour of equal treatment for countries with comparable levels of

development. This proposal is supported by several EU Member States. For equity reasons,

they want to extend the benefits provided by a future cooperation agreement to other poor

(least-developed) countries. This would be consistent with the overall poverty alleviation

focus, contained in the Treaty of Maastricht development cooperation objectives. Proponents

of this option also argue that the trade agreement for the ACP as a group is partly challenged

in the WTO because it discriminates against countries with comparable levels of development.

However, this option also carries risks. The "newcomers" would probably include highly

populated countries of South-east Asia (Bangladesh) and, depending on the criteria used,

perhaps also countries such as India or China. Such an extension would lead to a major

redistribution and dilution of available financial resources -- mainly at the expense of Africa.

It would also jeopardise EC attempts to obtain greater political leverage by concentrating its

development cooperation efforts. 

<p>

<li>Vary the geometry. This option proposes a Lom&#233; "umbrella agreement" as the

basic framework, objectives and principles of cooperation. The more detailed aspects of

cooperation could be covered by sub-agreements to which certain groups of countries would

be eligible. The main benefit of this option would be to reconcile to a large extent the

concerns of the defenders of the status quo and those who would like to see a greater

differentiation. The option of variable geometry could be elaborated on the basis of four

criteria:

<p>

<I>Geography</I>. One possibility is to break the ACP into three separate groups. Several ACP

interviewees favour keeping an overall Lom&#233; framework while introducing

differentiation through a set of separate conventions with each of the three regions of the

ACP group. In their view, such a "regionalisation" of Lom&#233; would allow the partners

to focus much more on the specific problems and development patterns of each region. It

would make it possible to find a better match with ongoing regional integration processes.



For the Caribbean, for instance, it has been argued that it would make little sense to exclude

Spanish speaking countries from a new deal between Europe and the Caribbean. A

geographical restructuring could take place, along the lines of the Association of Caribbean

States. In the case of Africa, there is much debate whether "regionalisation" would mean a single

convention with the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa, or rather a set of sub-regional agreements

(an option mainly advocated by Southern African interviewees). A majority seems to favour

a single convention, taking into account the fragility of sub-regional integration processes in

Africa, the danger of reduced bargaining power and the management problems associated

with a variety of sub-regional arrangements.



"Regionalisation" seems a far more dangerous option for the Pacific. The region is probably

too small, heterogeneous and "far away from Europe" to be covered in a fair and balanced

agreement. The perceived lack of common interests could lead to a withdrawal of Europe --

a scenario much feared by Pacific people, taking into account their levels of aid and trade

dependency.

<p>

<I>Development indicators</I>. Using this criterion, differentiation would be based on levels of

development within the ACP group. The purpose is to treat poor countries (Mozambique)

differently than those with middle incomes (Barbados) or even those with relatively high

incomes (the Bahamas). A deconstruction of Lom&#233; would allow more aid resources

to be allocated to the poorest countries, in line with the EU priorities for poverty alleviation.

This type of differentiation could be based on criteria such as per capita income or human

development indicators. Some also suggest to look at criteria such as purchasing power. On

the basis of some of these criteria it would be possible to split the ACP Group into sub-

groupings of least developed countries, less developed countries and middle income countries.

Some warn against to rigid a definition of such categories. It has, for instance, been argued

that per capita income does not necessarily reflect the full depth of development or of the

pervasiveness of poverty in society. In some ACP countries, per capita income, even though

high, is generated in large measure by existing preferences. If those countries lose their

preferences, you will see a shuddering drop in their per capita incomes.

<p>

<I>Content</I>. Another way to ensure differentiation is to introduce a Lom&#233; &#224; la

carte. The idea is to have different sub-agreements according to the nature and content of

the cooperation relationship. A menu of options would be available to ACP countries, with

or without reciprocity. Individual ACP countries or regions could select the options in the

menu that best suit their needs. This would, in turn, lead to the establishment of different

types of partnerships, ranging from a mere aid agreement to a free trade area.

<p>

<I>Performance</I>. This criterion is put forward by a number of European policy-makers. It

advocates the introduction of differentiated treatment on the basis of "performance" criteria.

This proposal is consistent with the "new politics of aid" which emphasise the need for

credible partners in development cooperation, good governance, and accountability. Under

this scenario, countries are distinguished according to, for example, whether they are in "deep

political and social turmoil," seriously reforming economies, or at the early stages of reform

processes. Proponents of this option argue that such categories may help to identify the most

appropriate support packages.

<p>

<li>Dismantle the ACP. This fourth option advocates a more radical approach. It starts

from the premise that there will no longer be a Lom&#233; "umbrella agreement." In this

scenario, the EU would probably negotiate a new set of separate agreements with each of the

three regions of the ACP group. Another possibility is to associate some ACP countries to

existing arrangements (the Caribbean might have a joint agreement with Central America).

</ul><p>

<h3>Additional Research is Needed</h3>

<p>

The issues of the changing "geography of Lom&#233;" and related differentiation of ACP

countries and regions opens a broad and complex policy agenda.

<p>

Both issues appear to be priorities on the EU agenda in the Beyond-Lom&#233; IV debate.

Much brainstorming is taking place on these topics, without much consultation so far with the

intended "beneficiaries" or "victims" of the proposed changes.

<p>

From this analysis, it is also clear that this debate is still rather embryonic in ACP countries.

Fears to become even more marginalised prevent many ACP actors from openly considering

the potential benefits of any redefinition of the Convention's geographical coverage. Hence,

the need for additional (joint) research into the different options and their likely implications.

<h1 align=center>From this month's editors</h1>

Class creates tensions that are leading some workplaces - in California
for example - to add 'class-awareness training' to the list of appropriate
therapies. <p>

The <b>NI</b> is very much a co-operative, but even so a 'hidden hand' can sometimes
be detected at work on our office politics. The design and office management
teams on the ground floor - where Alan, who designed this issue, works
- occasionally refer to themselves as 'the engine-room' or 'the trenches';
the editorial and marketing teams on the upper floors - where David,
one of our editors, works - imagine periodically that they sit on 'the
bridge'. From time to time a reasonably good-natured, low-intensity form
of class warfare seems possible. In order to edit this magazine Alan and
David have had, as it were, to bridge the trench: a painful posture which
class-awareness therapy seems unlikely to change.<p>

We ran a trial of the questionnaire that appears on page 14, asking some
of our colleagues to fill it in to see where they feature in the class struggle.
We assumed that everyone would, by virtue of an equal-pay policy and conventional
wisdom, classify as 'C1' or 'middle'. There were, however, some perverse
results. With a strange flourish, some people came forward with claims that
they had achieved working-class status. Closer scrutiny revealed errors
in the questionnaire, and a re-run duly evened things out.<p>

<br>


'Class' has become one of those odd words that are used as adjectives rather
than nouns. It is quite commonplace for someone to say 'working-class this',
'middle-class that' or 'ruling-class the other' - and remarkably rare
for them to say 'the working class', 'the middle class' or 'the ruling class'.
When we start to prevaricate with language it's a sure sign that something
troublesome is afoot. <p>

Some of the most interesting sections eventually had to be excluded from
the questionnaire: the names we give our children; what we call the kind
of houses we live in or the bodily functions we perform; the shops we use;
the curses we utter. All of them betray something about the class system
we live with and all are specific to the particular place where we live.
The scope for the denial of common experience across cultural or geographical
boundaries is pretty well limitless. Yet it is sometimes only by breaking
down barriers that we can see things at all. Class, in a global supermarket,
is one such thing.<p>

Mad Cow Disease has come to our rescue in Britain by displacing class as
'the British disease'. The perception that class was a uniquely British
obsession has prevented the <b>NI</b> from tackling it before. It was Alan -
perhaps the only one among us whose personal experience told him why -
who insisted that we must do so eventually. In the event, we could have
filled the magazine many times over with revealing stories about how class
operates around the world and the terrible constriction on the human spirit
that it imposes, without mentioning Britain once. For both of us the experience
has been a revelation. <p>

You may not be entirely surprised to learn, nonetheless, that because Alan
says 'class' as in 'mass', and David says 'class' as in 'art', it seemed
possible at one stage that we would fail to understand each other at all
and that this magazine would never have materialized.<BR>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Norwegian Development Cooperation</h3>



Norway's development cooperation stems from an old and powerful humanitarian and religious tradition. As

a strong supporter of the United Nations system, Norway has contributed to the development programmes of

the UN since the early 1950s. Voluntary contributions to the social work of Norwegian missionaries paved

the way for development aid in Parliament and with the public. In 1952 Parliament approved the creation of

The Norwegian Foundation for Assistance to Underdeveloped Countries. In 1968 the Norwegian Agency for

Development Cooperation (NORAD) was created, and in 1969 Norway set itself the target of 1 per cent of

NNI for development cooperation (including 0.75 of GNP for ODA).

<p>

Net official development assistance in 1992 amounted to US $ 1 273 million, which was 1.16 per cent of

GNP, the highest ratio in DAC Member countries. Since 1982 Norwegian ODA amounted to more than 1

per cent of GNP. For 1993 the figure was expected to decline 1.01 per cent amongst others due to the

present economic constraints. For the first time the 1994 figures will include the cost for the reception of

refugees in Norway, resulting in an effective cut of the budget by 3 per cent. These relative budget

decreases will be compensated by improved quality. In principle Norwegian ODA is divided equally

between multilateral and bilateral channels. Since 1970 multilateral contributions have never reached 50 per

cent of the budget. In 1992 the multilateral share was 36 per cent of total ODA. 

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Although certainly in its early years development cooperation was subject to intensive discussions in

Parliament, little of it is laid down in legislation. The Ministry of Development Cooperation (MDC), created

in 1983, was integrated into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in 1989. The Ministry has three

Ministers at the moment, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Trade and Shipping, and the

Minister of Development Cooperation, who is still a member of Cabinet. 

<p>

Norway's aid programme is divided into two roughly equal parts and is managed at two levels, one by the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the authority of the Minister of Development Cooperation, and one by

NORAD (Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation).

<p>

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs defines the general priorities and strategies for development cooperation,

the budgeting for Norwegian ODA, it sets general guidelines, formulates priorities and cross-sectoral

policies, and has direct responsibility for emergency, refugee and humanitarian aid, and for the overall

evaluation of the aid programme. The MFA covers around 10 per cent of the total aid budget. Under the

Minister of Development Cooperation three departments work on the formulation of the policies. The

Department for Bilateral Cooperation has divisions for different regions and for humanitarian assistance. The

Department for Multilateral Cooperation deals with UN organisations and development finance institutions,

and the Department for Development Cooperation Programmes is responsible for budget planning, for the

research programme, and for developing guidelines for development cooperation. Aid financed export

credits are administered by an institute under the Minister of Trade, provided NORAD approves of their

development impact.

<p>

Second, Norway's bilateral aid programme is managed by a separate agency, the Norwegian Agency for

Development Cooperation (NORAD). With the merger of the Ministries in 1989, NORAD was separated

again from the Ministry of Development Cooperation and was established as an external Directorate, under

the supervision of the development branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it still reported

directly to the Ministry. NORAD is primarily organised along geographical lines. There are two regional

departments, complemented by a Department for Technical Advisory Services, an Industrial Development

Department and a NGOs, Volunteers and Cultural Affairs Department. There is an advisory group on

Women, Environmental Affairs, Democracy and Human Rights Issues (KVIM) to the Director-General.

NORAD has Aid Missions in the main recipient countries, where implementation of the programmes is

done. 

<p>

Recently the MFA has established the Norwegian Resource Bank for Democracy and Human Rights, a fund

for technical assistance for democratic organisation, conflict resolution, constitutional development, human

rights education and related activities.

<p>

Overall policy planning is done by the Department of Development Cooperation Programmes of the MFA.

Advisors and advisory units do exist within the MFA, the MDC and NORAD for cross-cutting issues, such

as WID, environment and human rights. The integration of the Ministry of Development Cooperation into

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is motivated by the need to improve cooperation within the administration

and to strengthen the coherence in all decision making processes. Internal policy coordination within the

MFA is intensive. Daily or weekly meetings are held by the three Ministers or their representatives

(including NORAD); internal ad hoc committees discuss specific questions and sectors of aid policy. 

<p>

For policy coordination between ministries, a Contact Committee for Environmental Questions was re-

established, comprising representatives of the Ministry of the Environment and of various departments of the

MFA. These two Ministries drafted a Paper on the follow-up to UNCED. The White Paper No. 51 was

jointly written by the departments of the MFA that work under its three Ministers. Task forces, comprising

participants from the ministries concerned and from the Prime Minister's Office are regularly set up for the

preparation of important conferences, such as the Population Conference in Cairo (1994), and the Women's

Conference in Beijing (1995).

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

Advisory structures form an intrinsic part of the administrational set-up in Norway. NORAD used to have

an Advisory Board (Styrelse) as well an Advisory Council. The members of the Board were appointed by

the Government, and the 20 members of the Council by Parliament. The Council, created to build a

constituency for official development cooperation, included representatives from many sections of

Norwegian society, a.o. research institutes and universities, media, politics, NGOs and industry. Although

the formal mandate of the Council was rather limited, it discussed norms and objectives for Norwegian aid

policies, formulated guidelines, and discussed the annual budget. Its comments were sent to Parliament. The

Council was abolished in 1983, when NORAD was brought under the administrative structure of the newly

created Ministry of Development Cooperation. A new Advisory Council for the Ministry of Development

Cooperation was created, and for NORAD a Program Board was installed. The new Council functioned

mainly as a debating platform. In 1989 the number of advisory boards, -councils, and -committees for all

policy areas in the Norwegian administration was reduced substantially, and the Advisory Council was

abolished again, as well as the Board.

<p>

At the moment two advisory bodies function for the MFA, one on Human Rights questions, led by the

Special Advisor on Human Rights of the Ministry, and one on disarmament questions. The 'North-South

Commission' is a temporary institution. The MFA finances a 'Norwegian Ideas Group', that organises

seminars and issues a newsletter. 

<p>

Until the beginning of the 1990s a Nordic Council of the Ministers of Development Cooperation of

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden met bi-annually to discuss policy issues. Adjacent to these

meetings advisory meetings were organised of parliamentarians and researchers from the five countries. One

of these advisory meetings was a seminar Human Rights and Democracy held in Helsinki. The proceedings

were published in English. It is not known whether these meetings will be continued.

<p>

Parliament receives the annual budget for development cooperation, strategy and other policy documents,

annual reports as well as sector policy papers and evaluation studies. The annual budget is discussed in a

public session of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs. However, unlike the earlier years, when

extensive debates took place in Parliament on development cooperation, Parliamentarians do not seem to

devote much time to the subject nowadays. 

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

NORAD and the MFA both cooperate with NGOs. NGOs work usually for NORAD in those countries

where NORAD has no official presence itself. The Government intends to draw up framework agreements

with NGOs for long-term cooperation. Cooperation on a project-by-project base is declining, since the

Government promotes cooperation with local organisations. There are more then 60 highly motivated

developing NGOs, secular and church related, that were carrying out projects in more then 60 developing

countries in 1991. In 1993 NORAD provided support to 43 organisations. These numbers include

humanitarian, emergency and refugee relief aid. Norwegian NGOs shift from implementation to networking

with international NGOs and cooperation with local NGOs. The NGOs have regular working contacts and

policy discussions with the Ministry. They are active in the public debate and in development education.

Umbrella organisations are: the Norwegian Forum for Environment and Development, the North South

Coalition - both functioning as information banks and pressure groups - and the Missionary Council. NGOs

have well established contacts with politicians and other sectors of Norwegian society. Issues that NGOs

consider important for discussion with the Government are amongst others: post-emergency assistance,

professionalism of NGOs and the consequences for Norway of sustainable development policies. 

<p>

Researchers have always been involved in the formulations of development cooperation policies. Officials

have many contacts with researchers and advisers. The Minister of Development Cooperation used to

finance 3 to 5-year research programs. The Research Council for Development Cooperation was integrated

into the general Research Council of Norway in 1989. The Norwegian Institute of International Affairs

(NUPI) in Oslo used to organise seminars on development cooperation issues and publish the results in a

series. NUPI still issues a bi-annual journal, Forum for Development Studies. A leading role in development

cooperation issues is played by the Christian Michelsen Institute (CMI) in Bergen. The institute is often

requested by the Government to do studies on policy topics, for instance on the consequences for the

Norwegian aid programme of the entry of Norway into the EU. According to the OECD/EADI(1991) 10

institutes and centres in Norway qualify as Development Research and Training Institutes. 

<p>

The Government's intends to foster private sector participation in development cooperation through several

programmes: mixed credits for associated financing, guarantees for investments in and exports to developing

countries, investments in economic and social infrastructure for joint ventures with Norwegian private

enterprises, promotion of imports through the Norwegian Import Promotion Office for Products from

Developing Countries (NORIMPO).

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Belgian Development Cooperation</h3></a>

Official development cooperation started in the early 1960s, based on Belgium's historical

relations in Central Africa (Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi), a missionary tradition and the

importance attached to the functioning of the UN system. Public support for private

development cooperation activities has always been considerable, linked to a positive

attitude towards support for Third World problems in general. There seems to be a general

scepticism towards governmental cooperation programmes.

<p>

Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 865 million, or 0.39 per cent of

GNP. After a substantial increase in 1989/90, the volume of ODA decreased in 1992 when it

reached the 1988 level, which was the lowest percentage for two decades. With a decreasing

GNP, this is a decrease in real terms. Part of the 1992 allocations remained undisbursed.

Prospects are uncertain; increases are not expected, however. The aid volume target of 0.7

per cent ODA of GNP, repeatedly stated since 1970 was not mentioned after 1992. Multilateral

aid comprises around one-third of total ODA, with considerable variations in volume over the

years. 19 per cent of ODA was disbursed to the EU in 1992 and 18 per cent to other bilateral

institutions, mainly to the World Bank Group and as obligatory contributions to UN

institutions.



<a name="ins"><h3><hr>Institutional Framework</h3></a>



Official development cooperation is not based on an organic law but on numerous royal

decrees and administrative decisions from 1961 onwards. Several laws in other areas

concern specific components of development cooperation, mainly financing of aid. 

<p>

Depending on the domestic political situation, development cooperation is the responsibility

of a State Secretary (under different Ministers), a Minister of Development Cooperation or

the Minister of Foreign Affairs (MFA). In the present Government development cooperation

is spread over several ministries, of which the Ministries of Finance and External Trade

appear the most influential. 60 to 70 per cent of the budget is under the responsibility of a

State Secretary for Development Cooperation -or Minister of Development Cooperation, who

is not a member of the Cabinet- under the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The MFA manages the

bilateral programme, technical programmes and part of the financial and the multilateral aid.

The Ministry of Finance handles around 30 per cent: contributions to the World Bank group

and to regional banks, and state approved loans (the latter in cooperation with the Ministry

of External Trade). Around 2 per cent of the cooperation funds is managed by the Ministry

of Defence for military cooperation. The Ministry of Education handles nearly 1 per cent of

the total development budget for research institutes and universities, and specific

fellowships and expert sending programmes. The MFA handles, outside the aid

administration, part of the development budget for refugee aid, military training and for

compensation of nationalised property in Zaire. EU questions are the responsibility of the

Ministry of External Trade and European Affairs. 

<p>

Within the MFA development cooperation is managed by the General Administration for

Development Cooperation (AGCD or ABOS in Flemish) under the Minister of Development

Cooperation. AGCD, started mainly as an expert sending organisation in 1962, has since

been reorganised several times (based on studies by external consultants), in 1971, 1976,

1982, 1986 and, most recently in 1992. Since 1986 part of the AGCD officials is integrated

with the Foreign Service. The budget of the AGCD is part of the budget of the MFA.

<p>

Implementation is done by AGCD by the other ministries mentioned above ('direct bilateral

aid') and various NGOs, universities, other private organisations and enterprises,

communities, provinces and regions.  This latter category of 'indirect aid' via private

organisations accounted for 12 per cent of the AGCD's budget in 1988/89 and it is scheduled

to grow, while at the same time the number of recipient countries will be reduced. AGCD has

field offices at the embassies in around 20 recipient countries. The AGCD is organised in two

main sections, one for 'direct bilateral aid' and one for 'indirect aid', supplemented by

departments for planning, evaluation and services.  

<p>

Since 1981 two funding sources for development cooperation exist. The Fund for

Development Cooperation (FOS) is replenished from public and private funds. Bilateral

cooperation, including the AGCD activities, is financed from the FOS. It is managed by the

State Secretary for Development Cooperation in consultation with the Ministers of Foreign

Affairs and Finance, and an Interministerial Committee for the Budget. The Fund for Loans

to Foreign States (FPPE) is managed by the Ministers of Finance and External Trade, and is

replenished by public funds and income from repayments. An interministerial administrative

committee, including representatives from the Ministries of Finance, External Trade,

Economic Affairs, and Foreign Affairs, coordinates its functioning of the FPPE. Both funds

were established to enable the aid administration to implement pluriannual planning and

disbursements. It is not known whether this will be continued, since it has also created

underdisbursements.  

<p>

Policy planning is done by the 'Cabinet' of the Minister of Foreign Affairs - a 15 to 20 member

office of the Ministers choice and by the Department for Organisation, Training and

Evaluation Service of the AGCD. It is not known to what extend AGCD cooperates with

external consultants and research institutes.  

<p>

Over the years several ministerial committees for the coordination of cooperation policy have

been installed (1969, 1972, 1976, 1981, 1985). They apparently never were convened, or have

been abolished. There seems to be no mechanism for structural consultation between the

ministers responsible for components of ODA besides the two interministerial committees

mentioned above. 

<p>

Several studies, reports and policy papers on Belgian development cooperation have been

published over the years. There are, amongst others, the 1977 report of the study group on

adjustment problems, the 1982 SOBEMAP study on the AGCD, the 1988 paper 'Le dialogue

ouvert &#224; propos de la politique au d&#233;veloppement' of the Minister for Development

Cooperation, the 1992 paper 'On the path to alleviating rural poverty' by AGCD and IFAD, and

a 1994 policy paper (further details unknown), of which the part on employment has been

formulated in consultation with the employer's organisations and the trade unions. Most

policy documents focus on the implementation of aid activities in relation to the

administrative organisation of the programmes. It is not known whether there are sector and

country papers, or evaluations, and whether they are published. It is noted that statements

by ministers are more conclusive about policy developments than policy papers. Official data

on cooperation are often difficult and late to obtain. Annual reports on the activities of the

AGCD and the FPPE are presented to Parliament and are published.



<a name="adv"><hr><h3>Formal Advisory Strcutures and Mechanisms</h3></a>



One of the first three institutes for development cooperation, installed in 1962, was an

Advisory Council for Development Cooperation Policy. At the same time the Government

installed a Coordinating Ministerial Committee and an administrative aid division, which was

the predecessor of the present AGCD. Belgium was the first European country to install an

Advisory Council for Development Cooperation. The 14 member Council met regularly and

formulated recommendations. However, it never attained any status and its advice was not

sought by the Minister or the Parliament, nor by the public or the press. It was authorised to

discuss the general development cooperation programme and to make proposals for its

implementation, as well as to advise on draft legislation and budget proposals. It had a

limited autonomy and was not allowed to publish recommendations. Since 1962 several

reorganisations were decided upon, the last in 1977. In 1971 the membership was enlarged

to 35 members: 10 members nominated by the NGOs, 5 by the trade unions, 5 by the

employer's organisations, and 15 to be nominated by the Minister. The Council was also

allowed to publish its recommendations. Nevertheless, it appears not to have functioned.

Although it has not been abolished officially, it might be considered as non-existent.

<p>

Budgets, policy papers and annual reports are sent to Parliament. Parliamentary debates are

usually held around the annual budget and policy plan. As regards contents, decisions on

development cooperation policies are made mainly by the Government which does not seem

to be inclined to confront Parliament on these issues. There is no separate Parliamentary

Committee on Development Cooperation. Development cooperation is usually discussed in

various other Parliamentary Committees, such as the Committee for External Trade and

Technical Assistance, or External Relations and Defence. These Committee meetings tend

to be open for the public.  



<a name="ngo"><hr><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>



The approximately 250 development NGOs, personnel assistance organisations, solidarity

committees, and studygroups are based on Belgium's missionary tradition, former colonial

relations, the international solidarity movements and international university cooperation

groups. NGOs are actively involved in discussions and studies on development cooperation,

in implementation and lobbying. They have good relationships with the political and other

sectors of society. Project implementation is done through their partner organisations in

developing countries, either on their own funds or co-funded by the Government. To be

eligible for funding from the co-funding programme of AGCD, NGOs need to be formally

recognised by the Government. However, bilateral aid through NGOs is limited to emergency

aid. The management and funding of certain NGO-activities has been delegated to the

Regional Governments, for instance the Netherlands and French language teaching

activities. The Government has announced to step up implementation of projects through

NGOs. Structural contacts between government and the NGOs have been established,

amongst others through the installation of three Advisory Commissions in 1991. In 1993 a

Round Table of NGO and Government representatives discussed debt relief issues.

Cooperation with employer's organisations and trade unions have already been mentioned.

Topics for discussions with the Government are amongst others: actuality of information,

stated policy objectives and realisation, commercialisation of development cooperation and

the increase of Government cooperation with NGOs.

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 22 institutes in Belgium qualify as Development

Research and Training Institutes. Some of the best known are: the Institut de M&#233;decine

tropicale Prince L&#233;opold, the International Institute of Administrative Sciences, and the many

faculties and institutes at the universities of Antwerp, Ghent and Louvain. They publish

numerous reports and studies on specific development issues and do consultancy services

for AGCD. Several universities are involved in training programmes for foreign students and

education projects. NGOs execute extensive programmes for development education, partly

government funded.

<p>

There are two university based umbrella organisations that have a Committee for

Development Cooperation. The Committees include representatives of universities, of the

AGCD and the Minister of Development Cooperation. The organisation in the French

speaking region is the CIUF (the Francophone Interuniversity Council) and in the Flemish

speaking region the VLIR (the Flemish Interuniversity Council). Although the details of their

specific mandates are not quite clear, the activities of both Committees may contribute to the

policy debate on development cooperation. Both organisations conduct research for

developing countries and developing projects, as well as on development policy and

cooperation management.

<p>

Over the years more informal groups have played an influential but temporary role in the

development debate, such as the Association for the Study of International Division of

Income and Employment, which formulated rural development as one of the first priorities

for Belgian development cooperation.

<p>

Some large corporations have been main contractors for development projects in the areas

of energy production, telecommunications and railway infrastructure, through the Ministries

of Finance and External Trade. The 1992 Government announced plans to limit

commercialisation of development assistance, at the same time inviting private enterprise

to play an active role within the objectives of development cooperation.

<h3>PLANNERS AIM FOR 'A LITTLE TAIWAN' IN THE JUNGLE</h3>
<i>
Plans for a land bridge across Mexico to rival the Panama Canal and cash in
on global trade are being welcomed by business interests. But critics,
reports <b>Gemini News Service</b>, point to the dire threat to a largely unspoilt
tropical forest and its indigenous inhabitants.
<p>


By <b>JOHN ROSS</b>,<br>
26 July 1996,<br>
Mexico City      </i><hr><p>




Mexico is hoping to cash in on economic globalisation by creating "a little
Taiwan" - in an area containing the country's last great tropical forest.<p>

Whereas the government sees international success - a chance to make the
country a link between the Asian "Tigers" and consumer markets in the
United States - environmentalist Miguel Angel Garcia sees local disaster.<p>

"This proposal is a death sentence for these forests," he warns, "and
Mexico can't live without them."<p>

Supporters describe the plan to drive a transport corridor through the
Tehuantepec isthmus as a brilliant opportunity to tap growing world trade.<p>

They say the Atlantic-Pacific link could both rival and relieve the
congested Panama Canal.<p>

The building of road and rail links could also pave the way for large-scale
industrial development in the narrow neck of Mexico. "This could become a
Taiwancito," gushed a government official.<p>

But critics say that such an outcome could be disastrous for the
Chimilapas, the forest that covers much of the isthmus, and the 12,000
Zoque Indians who live there.<p>

"These plans will reduce the Chimilapas to the size of a park," says
Garcia. "They'll probably give us a golf course," he quips blackly,
referring to another community's struggle against a controversial sports
project in Morelos state.<p>

Teeming with tapirs, toucans, ocelots, jaguars and rare flora and fauna,
the 18,000 square kilometres of Chimilapas mountain and lowland jungles
straddle an area that has for centuries been eyed as the site of a canal or
land bridge between oceans.<p>

The Aztecs, Spanish and North Americans all sought to develop Tehuantepec
trade routes.<p>

In 1907, a 303-kilometre single-track railway was built, and oil pipelines
were constructed in the 1970s with the help of Japanese investors keen to
tap Mexico's oil boom.<p>

A Tehuantepec canal is currently ruled out on cost and technical grounds.
But proposals for a land bridge have now been drawn up by the department of
Mexico's Secretary of Communications and Transport (SCT) at a time when the
government is selling off railways and port facilities as part of a major
privatisation drive.<p>

Detailed plans have not been published, but a four-lane highway between
Veracruz and Oaxaca is already scheduled for completion by 2000 to
facilitate road haulage between coasts.<p>

Rail privatisation could herald two-way container trains. More than 80
transport companies will start bidding in August for the concessions on
five routes - of which the Tehuantepec line is the plum attraction.<p>

Big commercial rewards are guaranteed for whoever picks up the line and the
port facilities at either end. Time-saving is a key feature of the
Tehuantepec route: unloading, transporting, and reloading between oceans is
calculated to take 24 hours.<p>

Cuitlahuac Morales, port director at Salina Cruz, says that use of the
route will cut days off comparative journey times through the Panama Canal
where more than 60 vessels have to wait in line.<p>

With this in mind, Salina Cruz is building storage yards to hold 80,000
containers.<p>

The SCT is also understood to be proposing the siting of new assembly
plants on the Pacific-side Tehuantepec plain, touting the region for its
cheap labour and the abundant hydroelectric power that future dams on
Chimilapas rivers could provide.<p>

Commented a leading national financial newspaper, El Financiero: "The
development and concession of the Tehuantepec corridor is the most
important strategic decision (Mexico's President Ernesto) Zedillo will take
during his six-year term."<p>

Transforming the isthmus into a land bridge is of vital strategic
importance to transnational interests competing in a global economy, says
Andres Barreda, a strategic resources investigator at the Autonomous
University of Mexico.<p>

It will improve links between production centres in eastern Asia and prime
consumer markets in the southern and eastern US and the Midwest. Oil flows
will also benefit.<p>

Environmentalist Garcia believes the proposed commercial corridor will open
up the forest to private exploitation - posing a big threat to the
Chimilapas and the Zoques, who have long sought to defend their land from
timber firms and other commercial interests.<p>

Garcia, assisted by a World Wide Fund for Nature grant, has been seeking to
bring the Chimilapas' 34 agrarian communities together in a pact with the
Zoques to boost conservation efforts. In the past, they have managed to
curb road-building and the burning of woods for new farmland. "Every road
built represents a loss of resource," he says.<p>

The projected industrial boom will poison the air and drain rivers on the
Atlantic side if dams are built to siphon off hydroelectricity for Pacific
coast development, he says. And a big influx of job-seekers "will bring us
everything the neo-liberal social pathology dictates: prostitution,
alcoholism, inflation, contamination". - GEMINI NEWS

    <TITLE>NI Issue 274 - Tibet - a cause for courage</TITLE>

<H3>New Internationalist Issue 274</H3>
<BR>
<I>The material that follows has been provided by <A HREF="../NIinfo.html">New

'Tibet' - even while preparing to sneak into the country to research this report, the word kept conjuring up romantic and exotic images in my mind. This was to be a trip to the 'Roof of the World', the 'Forbidden Kingdom', the mythical 'Shangri-La'. The Himalayan home of a peace-loving, unworldly people, who smile a lot and believe in a god-king they call the Dalai Lama. The mythology surrounding Tibet was powerful, and I was as susceptible to it as anyone. <p>



But I was also getting another, quite different, set of images - coming mainly from action-group bulletins and newsletters. The recent case of Sherab Ngawang, for instance, a 15-year-old political prisoner who was beaten to death because she 'pulled a face' at one of her Chinese guards. Or Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who earlier this year came to the West to show reporters his nefarious collection of torture instruments. They were the kind used against him by his Chinese jailers over the course of 30 years, and he had obtained them by bribing guards.<p>

These two sets of images - the romantic and the horrific - do not sit easily together. And the first set may well have done the cause of the Tibetan people more harm than good. If Tibetans are presented as a dreamy, unrealistic people, obsessed with religion, their struggle is unlikely to be taken seriously by a world driven by more secular values. Their demand for independence will be seen as pie-in-the-sky and their ability to rule themselves will be open to question.<p>

Meanwhile, frustration is mounting among many Tibetans as they see their country no nearer to regaining its independence than it was at the time of the Chinese invasion 45 years ago. Some are asking how much longer Buddhist patience and non-violent resistance can hold out - is resort to the gun the only way to get heard in a violent world?<p>

I had to get into Tibet if I were to gain any real sense of the conditions under which Tibetans are currently living. But working there had its difficulties. I had never before been in a country where surveillance was so intense and informer networks so organized that you really were putting locals at risk just by talking with them. Even Pinochet's Chile seemed safer in this respect.<p>

It's one of the many ways in which China tries to stop real information about Tibet reaching the rest of the world. This issue of NI tries to get that information out by its own route - going first to Kathmandu to interview recent Tibetan escapees; then furtively into Tibet itself; and finally to Dharamsala, home of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile.

<H3>Historique et avenir du groupe ACP</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171;Il existe une solidarit&eacute; interne au groupe ACP m&ecirc;me en l'absence d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs concrets partag&eacute;s par les trois parties&#187; (un chercheur africain).</I>

<P>

La cr&eacute;ation du groupe ACP est li&eacute;e &agrave; l'adh&eacute;sion du Royaume-Uni &agrave; la CEE. Une vingtaine d'Etats du Commonwealth, d'Afrique, des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique furent invit&eacute;s &agrave; nouer des relations sp&eacute;cifiques avec la CEE,sur le mod&egrave;le de l'association d&eacute;j&agrave; existante entre la CEE et dix-huit pays africains francophones (dans le cadre des Conventions de Yaound&eacute;).

<P>

Tous ces pays &eacute;taient d'anciennes colonies des Etats membres de la CEE. C'est ce pass&eacute; colonial qui a dessin&eacute; les contours g&eacute;ographiques du futur groupe ACP. Alors qu'il avait toujours &eacute;t&eacute; entendu que la Convention de Lom&eacute; devait couvrir l'ensemble de l'Afrique subsaharienne, c'est le crit&egrave;re colonial qui a d&eacute;termin&eacute; l'&eacute;ligibilit&eacute; des Etats du Pacifique et des Cara&iuml;bes &agrave; un traitement sp&eacute;cial. Cela explique pourquoi la Convention a souvent &eacute;t&eacute; qualifi&eacute;e d'accord postcolonial.

<P>

Selon Dieter Frisch, ancien directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de la DG VIII, &#171;de nombreux pays europ&eacute;ens ont &eacute;t&eacute; surpris quand les Etats d'Afrique, des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique se sont assis ensemble &agrave; la table de n&eacute;gociations avec la CEE en juillet 1973. On se serait plut&#244;t attendu &agrave; ce que les n&eacute;gociations soient men&eacute;es parall&egrave;lement avec les trois groupes. La formation du groupe ACP, qui peut appara&icirc;tre quelque peu artificielle, a r&eacute;sult&eacute; d'un certain nombre de probl&egrave;mes communs (sucre), mais surtout du fait que les pays du Pacifique et des Cara&iuml;bes entendaient profiter de la position de force, consid&eacute;rable &agrave; l'&eacute;poque, de l'Afrique noire dans les n&eacute;gociations&#187;. 

<P>

Vingt ans apr&egrave;s, et consid&eacute;rant l'horizon 2000, il y a lieu de se demander si le groupe ACP est encore un concept viable et efficace. Est-il judicieux de conserver cet ensemble, compte tenu de l'h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&eacute;n&eacute;it&eacute; croissante entre les r&eacute;gions et les pays concern&eacute;s? La Convention de Lom&eacute; peut-elle continuer &agrave; proposer un traitement sp&eacute;cial &agrave; un groupe particulier de pays, ou bien, serait-il plus appropri&eacute; d'abandonner cette approche g&eacute;ographique en faveur d'un traitement identique pour tous les pays &agrave; niveau de d&eacute;veloppement comparable? Et si l'on tend vers une nouvelle division g&eacute;ographique, quels crit&egrave;res utiliser pour diff&eacute;rencier la future coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne avec le monde en d&eacute;veloppement? Peut-on introduire une diff&eacute;renciation tout en pr&eacute;servant les meilleurs principes de la Convention de Lom&eacute;?

<P>

<H3>Pressions sur la g&eacute;ographie de Lom&eacute;</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171;Le groupe ACP existerait-il encore aujourd'hui, si l'UE ne fournissait pas 14 milliards d'&eacute;cus tous les cinq ans?&#187; (un chercheur europ&eacute;en)</I>

<P>

La question de la couverture g&eacute;ographique de la Convention de Lom&eacute; (et donc la survie du groupe ACP) figurera en t&ecirc;te de l'ordre du jour des d&eacute;bats sur la future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Plusieurs facteurs plaident en faveur d'un r&eacute;examen de la g&eacute;ographie de Lom&eacute;:

<P>

<LI><I>H&eacute;t&eacute;rog&eacute;n&eacute;it&eacute; croissante des ACP</I>. La diversit&eacute; des situations existant dans les ACP est source de tensions. En effet, il est de plus en plus difficile de discerner les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs liant les 70 pays ACP entre eux. Cela tend &agrave; affaiblir leur position dans les n&eacute;gociations avec l'UE, tout en r&eacute;duisant l'efficacit&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des institutions ACP. Cela permet peut-&ecirc;tre aussi d'expliquer le poids limit&eacute; des ACP dans d'autres forums internationaux, tels que l'OMC et les institutions de Bretton Woods. Les repr&eacute;sentants de pays ACP d&eacute;mocratiques et &#171; bien g&eacute;r&eacute;s &#187; expriment souvent leur frustration &agrave; se voir assimiler et rel&eacute;guer par l'UE dans le groupe des moins performants.

<P>

<LI><I>Exigences par l'UE d'une diff&eacute;renciation accrue</I>. Les pr&eacute;occupations quant &agrave; l'utilisation et &agrave; l'efficacit&eacute; des fonds engag&eacute;s ont amen&eacute; la communaut&eacute; des donateurs &agrave; diff&eacute;rencier de plus en plus entre diverses cat&eacute;gories de pays en d&eacute;veloppement, selon toute une s&eacute;rie de crit&egrave;res, tels que les niveaux de d&eacute;veloppement et l'engagement &agrave; adopter des r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques. A l'heure actuelle, l'UE cherche aussi &agrave; introduire un plus grand degr&eacute; de diff&eacute;renciation et de s&eacute;lectivit&eacute; dans ses relations de coop&eacute;ration. Or la Convention actuelle n'a pas vraiment pr&eacute;vu cette &eacute;ventualit&eacute; car elle propose, dans une grande mesure, un traitement uniforme pour tous les pays ACP, sans tenir compte de leur d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique, de leur syst&egrave;me de gouvernement, de leurs capacit&eacute;s administratives ni de leurs performances. Les m&ecirc;mes dispositions commerciales valent pour l'ensemble du groupe. Une certaine diff&eacute;renciation existe seulement au plan de la coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re et technique, par exemple par le biais de la programmation par tranches.

<P>

<LI><I>Changements politiques internes en Europe</I>. Le partenaire europ&eacute;en a beaucoup &eacute;volu&eacute; depuis la signature de la premi&egrave;re Convention de Lom&eacute;. L'Union europ&eacute;enne compte maintenant quinze Etats membres, et les nouveaux venus sont en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral peu enclins &agrave; partager la philosophie de Lom&eacute; qu'ils consid&egrave;rent comme une &#171; relique postcoloniale &#187; et &#171;discriminatoire &#187;. L'&eacute;largissement pr&eacute;vu de l'Union va aggraver le probl&egrave;me. L'UE a formul&eacute; sa politique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale en mati&egrave;re de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement dans le trait&eacute; de Maastricht, alors que la Convention de Lom&eacute; et le FED sortent de ce cadre. Actuellement des pressions de plus en plus insistantes se font sentir pour int&eacute;grer Lom&eacute; &agrave; la politique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et budg&eacute;tiser le FED (afin de l'int&eacute;grer dans le budget et les proc&eacute;dures g&eacute;n&eacute;rales de l'UE). Enfin, une coop&eacute;ration privil&eacute;gi&eacute;e avec le groupe  ACP en tant que tel n'est plus une priorit&eacute; de politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re partag&eacute;e au sein de l'UE. Les Etats membres ont des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts divergents, li&eacute;s soit &agrave; leur propre histoire (l'Espagne et l'Am&eacute;rique du Sud), soit &agrave; la proximit&eacute; (l'Europe du Sud et le monde m&eacute;diterran&eacute;en), soit encore aux int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques (Asie du Sud-Est) ou &agrave; la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; (&agrave; la fois dans les pays ACP et non-ACP).

<P>

<H3>Incertitudes quant au  maintien du groupe ACP</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171;Pour des raisons politiques et strat&eacute;giques, le groupe ACP devrait continuer &agrave; exister, m&ecirc;me si les diff&eacute;rences &eacute;conomiques entre les r&eacute;gions ne font que s'accro&icirc;tre&#187; (un fonctionnaire des Cara&iuml;bes).</I>

<P>

Il est &eacute;vident que les pays ACP doivent d&eacute;cider eux-m&ecirc;mes s'ils veulent continuer &agrave; former ensemble un groupe unique dans un futur accord de coop&eacute;ration les liant &agrave; l'UE. A la lumi&egrave;re des consultations que nous avons entreprises, la r&eacute;ponse &agrave; cette question est plut&#244;t ambivalente. La plupart des gens interrog&eacute;s d&eacute;fendent fermement la configuration actuelle de Lom&eacute; et l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; du groupe ACP. Selon eux, toute tentative de briser la g&eacute;ographie de Lom&eacute; affaiblirait les ACP. Les partisans du maintien du groupe ACP avancent les arguments suivants:

<P>

<LI><I>Position de force dans les n&eacute;gociations</I>. C'est la raison qui a pr&eacute;sid&eacute; &agrave; la formation du groupe, et elle est toujours per&ccedil;ue comme un argument valable. La taille du groupe &#171;a renforc&eacute; la position (dans les n&eacute;gociations) des membres et des r&eacute;gions individuels du groupe des ACP, dans leurs interactions avec la Commission europ&eacute;enne et le Conseil&#187;. Cela est particuli&egrave;rement vrai pour les petits Etats insulaires des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique. De nombreuses voix dans les Cara&iuml;bes affirment que &#171;le cadre de Lom&eacute; a permis d'acqu&eacute;rir un poids dans les n&eacute;gociations sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; celui que la r&eacute;gion aurait pu obtenir par ses propres moyens&#187;. Dans le Pacifique, l'opinion selon laquelle la r&eacute;gion &#171;glisserait dans l'oubli si elle avait affaire &agrave; l'UE en tant que simple r&eacute;gion &#187; est tr&egrave;s largement r&eacute;pandue.

<P>

<LI><I>Structure de concertation et de dialogue</I>. Le m&eacute;canisme consultatif au sein de la Convention a permis &agrave; la Communaut&eacute; d'entamer un dialogue et de s'engager dans une coop&eacute;ration sur des bases communes avec une grande partie du monde en d&eacute;veloppement. Un &eacute;clatement du groupe, par exemple au travers d'arrangements sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; une r&eacute;gion, n&eacute;cessiterait &agrave; la fois la mise en place de nouvelles structures de concertation et un accroissement de la bureaucratie et des capacit&eacute;s de gestion au niveau de la Commission. 

<P>

<LI><I>Coop&eacute;ration inter-ACP</I>. M&ecirc;me si les relations ne sont pas toujours tr&egrave;s harmonieuses, les barri&egrave;res artificielles ont &eacute;t&eacute; dans une certaine mesure supprim&eacute;es et il semble que la coop&eacute;ration ait &eacute;t&eacute; renforc&eacute;e entre diff&eacute;rentes composantes des ACP, y compris entre l'Afrique francophone et l'Afrique anglophone. L'&eacute;tendue et la grande diversit&eacute; du groupe ont engendr&eacute; &#171;un &eacute;change fructueux d'exp&eacute;riences, de syst&egrave;mes de gouvernement et de cultures&#187;. Une autre raison invoqu&eacute;e pour conserver l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; du groupe est &#171;le vaste potentiel qu'il repr&eacute;sente pour la coop&eacute;ration Sud-Sud&#187;, bien qu'il faille admettre que les r&eacute;sultats &agrave; ce jour aient &eacute;t&eacute; relativement limit&eacute;s.

<P>

<LI><I>Doutes sur l'effet discriminatoire au d&eacute;triment d'Etats non-ACP</I>. Tout en reconnaissant le traitement sp&eacute;cial octroy&eacute; par l'UE, certains affirment qu'il n'a pas provoqu&eacute; de v&eacute;ritable discrimination &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des pays non-ACP en ce qui concerne leurs exportations vers les march&eacute;s europ&eacute;ens (en effet, ils b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient de la g&eacute;n&eacute;ralisation des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales). De plus, la coop&eacute;ration de l'UE avec les pays non-ACP les moins avanc&eacute;s d&eacute;passe de beaucoup celle qu'elle entretient avec de nombreux pays ACP.

<P>

Dans le m&ecirc;me temps, toutefois, nombreux sont ceux qui admettent que l'unit&eacute; sacr&eacute;e des ACP s'est vid&eacute;e de son sens. Selon eux, il devient de plus en plus difficile &#171; de concilier, dans un groupe si grand et si incoh&eacute;rent, la grande diversit&eacute; des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts en jeu et les antagonismes entre les diff&eacute;rents groupes et r&eacute;gions&#187;. Ainsi, la position de force dans les n&eacute;gociations, si fr&eacute;quemment invoqu&eacute;e, n'a pas pu, en fin de compte, &eacute;viter l'&eacute;rosion du traitement pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel. 

<P>

Dans ce contexte, on s'est souvent demand&eacute; si &#171;une nouvelle n&eacute;gociation globale entre 70 pays ACP et l'UE &eacute;tait la mani&egrave;re la plus appropri&eacute;e de d&eacute;fendre les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts des diff&eacute;rentes composantes du groupe ACP&#187;. Selon les partisans de cette th&egrave;se, la relance des relations avec l'Europe pourrait n&eacute;cessiter &#171;des accords r&eacute;gionaux beaucoup plus sp&eacute;cifiques, bas&eacute;s sur des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts mutuels red&eacute;finis&#187;. Ils estiment que cela ne devrait pas provoquer la disparition de l'esprit de Lom&eacute;. Comme un chercheur des Cara&iuml;bes l'a d&eacute;clar&eacute; : &#171;L'histoire a ses droits et le changement est par d&eacute;finition porteur d'&eacute;volutions, d'o&ugrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de tendre vers une plus grande diff&eacute;renciation (r&eacute;gionale) tout en conservant le cadre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Lom&eacute;&#187;.

<P>

<H3>Options en vue de la diff&eacute;renciation</H3>

<P>

La section ci-apr&egrave;s examinera en d&eacute;tail les diff&eacute;rents sc&eacute;narios qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; propos&eacute;s pour la future couverture g&eacute;ographique de Lom&eacute; et la question connexe du traitement diff&eacute;renci&eacute;. On peut distinguer quatre options principales:

<P>

<LI><B><I>Pr&eacute;server le statu quo (tout en proc&eacute;dant &agrave; des changements mineurs)</B></I>. Cette option constitue un choix tranch&eacute; en faveur de la continuit&eacute;. Ses partisans soulignent que le groupe fonctionne relativement bien et qu'il semble par cons&eacute;quent peu appropri&eacute; de supprimer cette structure en l'absence d'autres dispositions qui offriraient des avantages politiques et institutionnels analogues &agrave; ses membres. La couverture g&eacute;ographique de Lom&eacute; ne devrait donc subir aucune modification majeure. Un nombre restreint de pays pourraient rejoindre le groupe ACP (l'Afrique du Sud et Cuba) afin, notamment, d'assurer une plus grande coh&eacute;sion r&eacute;gionale. Les exigences de l'UE en mati&egrave;re de flexibilit&eacute; et de diff&eacute;renciation accrue pourraient &ecirc;tre satisfaites dans les limites du cadre existant, soit par l'emploi diversifi&eacute; des instruments de la coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re et technique, soit par un affinement de la programmation par tranches. D'un point de vue strat&eacute;gique, il est tout &agrave; fait compr&eacute;hensible que cette option jouisse d'un large soutien dans le groupe ACP. Cependant, une proposition de statu quo n'appara&icirc;t gu&egrave;re susceptible ni de rencontrer un soutien s&eacute;rieux au niveau europ&eacute;en, ni d'offrir de solides garanties contre une marginalisation plus pouss&eacute;e du groupe ACP.

<P>

<LI><B><I>&Eacute;tendre les acquis de Lom&eacute;</B></I>. L'id&eacute;e centrale de cette option est d'abandonner l'approche g&eacute;ographique au profit d'une &eacute;galit&eacute; de traitement des pays &agrave; niveaux de d&eacute;veloppement comparables. Cette proposition b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie du soutien de plusieurs Etats membres de l'UE. Pour des raisons d'&eacute;quit&eacute;, ils voudraient &eacute;tendre les avantages d'un futur accord de coop&eacute;ration &agrave; d'autres pays pauvres parmi les moins avanc&eacute;s. Cela serait conforme &agrave; l'accent mis sur la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;, au titre des objectifs de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement du trait&eacute; de Maastricht. Les partisans de cette option soulignent, de surcro&icirc;t, que l'accord commercial en faveur du groupe ACP dans son ensemble est contest&eacute; au sein de l'OMC notamment parce qu'il est discriminatoire envers des pays &agrave; niveau de d&eacute;veloppement comparable. Cependant, cette option comporte aussi des risques. Parmi les nouveaux membres figureraient probablement certains des pays les plus dens&eacute;ment peupl&eacute;s de l'Asie du Sud-Est (Bangladesh) et peut-&ecirc;tre, selon le choix des crit&egrave;res utilis&eacute;s, des pays comme l'Inde et la Chine. Une telle extension d&eacute;boucherait sur une redistribution et une dilution importantes des ressources financi&egrave;res disponibles, surtout aux d&eacute;pens de l'Afrique. Cela remettrait &eacute;galement en cause les tentatives de la CE d'accro&icirc;tre son influence politique par le biais de la concentration de ses efforts en mati&egrave;re de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement. 

<P>

<LI><B><I>Adopter une g&eacute;om&eacute;trie variable</B></I>. Cette option propose un accord-cadre de Lom&eacute; qui d&eacute;finirait la structure, les objectifs et les principes de la coop&eacute;ration. Les aspects plus d&eacute;taill&eacute;s de la coop&eacute;ration serait couverts par des sous-accords dont certains groupes de pays pourraient b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier. Cette option pr&eacute;sente l'avantage principal de concilier dans une large mesure les pr&eacute;occupations des partisans du statu quo et de ceux qui pr&#244;nent une plus grande diff&eacute;renciation. L'option &agrave; &#171; g&eacute;om&eacute;trie variable &#187; pourrait s'articuler autour de quatre crit&egrave;res:

<P>

<UL>

<LI><LI><I>G&eacute;ographie</I>. La premi&egrave;re possibilit&eacute; serait de scinder le groupe ACP en trois entit&eacute;s distinctes. Plusieurs repr&eacute;sentants des ACP interrog&eacute;s se d&eacute;clarent en faveur du maintien d'un cadre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral Lom&eacute; tout en introduisant une diff&eacute;renciation par le biais de conventions s&eacute;par&eacute;es avec chacune des trois r&eacute;gions du groupe ACP. Selon eux, cette r&eacute;gionalisation de Lom&eacute; permettrait aux partenaires de concentrer beaucoup plus leur attention sur les probl&egrave;mes sp&eacute;cifiques et les dynamiques de d&eacute;velop- pement de chaque r&eacute;gion. Cette option permettrait de prendre en compte de fa&ccedil;on plus satisfaisante les processus d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale en cours. 

<P>

Ainsi, dans les Cara&iuml;bes, certains affirment qu'il serait peu sens&eacute; d'exclure les pays hispanophones d'un nouvel arrangement entre l'Europe et les Cara&iuml;bes. Une restructuration g&eacute;ographique pourrait intervenir dans le sens de l'Association des Etats des Cara&iuml;bes.

<P>

Dans le cas de l'Afrique, les avis sont partag&eacute;s sur la question de savoir si la r&eacute;gionalisation se traduirait par une convention unique avec l'ensemble de l'Afrique subsaharienne ou plut&#244;t par une s&eacute;rie d'accords sous-r&eacute;gionaux (option principalement d&eacute;fendue par nos interlocuteurs d'Afrique australe). Une majorit&eacute; semble opter en faveur d'une convention unique, compte tenu de la pr&eacute;carit&eacute; des processus d'int&eacute;gration sous-r&eacute;gionaux en Afrique, des probl&egrave;mes associ&eacute;s &agrave; la multiplicit&eacute; des arrangements sous-r&eacute;gionaux et du risque d'un affaiblissement de position en mati&egrave;re de n&eacute;gociations. 

<P>

La r&eacute;gionalisation semble une option beaucoup plus risqu&eacute;e pour le Pacifique. La r&eacute;gion est vraisemblablement trop petite, h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;ne et bien trop &eacute;loign&eacute;e de l'Europe pour &ecirc;tre couverte par un accord &eacute;quitable et &eacute;quilibr&eacute;. L'absence constat&eacute;e d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs pourrait d&eacute;boucher sur un retrait de l'Europe, sc&eacute;nario que craignent les habitants du Pacifique, compte tenu de leur niveau de d&eacute;pendance par rapport &agrave; l'aide et aux &eacute;changes commerciaux.

<P>

<LI><LI><I>Indicateurs de d&eacute;veloppement</I>. En cas d'utilisation de ce crit&egrave;re, la diff&eacute;renciation serait bas&eacute;e sur les niveaux de d&eacute;veloppement au sein du groupe ACP, et ce, dans l'intention de traiter les pays pauvres (Mozambique) diff&eacute;remment de ceux &agrave; revenus moyens (Barbade) et m&ecirc;me de ceux &agrave; revenus relativement &eacute;lev&eacute;s (Bahamas). Un d&eacute;mant&egrave;lement de Lom&eacute; permettrait qu'une quantit&eacute; accrue de ressources d'aide soit allou&eacute;e aux pays les plus pauvres, conform&eacute;ment aux priorit&eacute;s de l'UE en faveur de la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;. Ce type de diff&eacute;renciation pourrait s'appuyer sur des crit&egrave;res comme le revenu par habitant ou des indicateurs de d&eacute;veloppement humain. D'autres voix sugg&egrave;rent aussi de consid&eacute;rer le crit&egrave;re du pouvoir d'achat. Sur la base de certains de ces crit&egrave;res, on pourrait subdiviser le groupe ACP en sous-groupes: pays moins avanc&eacute;s, pays en d&eacute;veloppement et pays &agrave; revenus interm&eacute;diaires. Certains s'insurgent contre une d&eacute;finition trop rigide de ces cat&eacute;gories; ils ont avanc&eacute;, par exemple, que le revenu par habitant ne refl&egrave;te pas n&eacute;cessairement le degr&eacute; r&eacute;el du d&eacute;veloppement ou de la p&eacute;n&eacute;tration de la pauvret&eacute; dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Dans certains pays ACP, le revenu par habitant, pour &eacute;lev&eacute; qu'il puisse &ecirc;tre, est souvent g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; dans une large mesure par les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences existantes. Si ces pays perdaient leurs pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences, il s'ensuivrait une chute inqui&eacute;tante du revenu par habitant. 

<P>

<LI><LI><I>Contenu</I>. Une autre mani&egrave;re d'assurer une diff&eacute;renciation consisterait &agrave; introduire une Convention de Lom&eacute; &agrave; la carte. Cela &eacute;quivaudrait &agrave; mettre en place diff&eacute;rents sous-accords en fonction de la nature et du contenu de la relation de coop&eacute;ration. Un menu d'options serait mis &agrave; la disposition des pays ACP, avec ou sans r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;. Les pays ou r&eacute;gions ACP pourraient s&eacute;lectionner individuellement dans ce menu les options r&eacute;pondant le mieux &agrave; leurs besoins. Il en r&eacute;sulterait diff&eacute;rents types de partenariat, allant d'un accord d'aide pur et simple &agrave; une zone de libre-&eacute;change (ZLE).

<P>

<LI><LI><I>Performance</I>. Ce crit&egrave;re est invoqu&eacute; par un certain nombre de d&eacute;cideurs europ&eacute;ens, dans la perspective de l'introduction de traitements diff&eacute;renci&eacute;s sur la base de la &#171; performance &#187; des pays ACP. Cette proposition s'inscrit dans la ligne de la nouvelle politique d'aide qui met l'accent sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; des partenaires en mati&egrave;re de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement, de bonne gouvernance et d'obligation de transparence. Ce sc&eacute;nario &eacute;tablit une distinction entre les pays en fonction, du fait par exemple qu'ils se trouvent dans &#171; une phase de profond bouleversement politique et social &#187;, dans &#171; une situation de r&eacute;forme s&eacute;rieuse de leur &eacute;conomie &#187;, par exemple par l'application de programmes d'ajustement structurel ou &#171; au premier stade des processus de r&eacute;forme &#187;. Les partisans de cette option soulignent qu'une telle cat&eacute;gorisation pourrait permettre d'identifier les programmes d'appui les plus appropri&eacute;s. 

</UL>

<P>

<LI><B><I>D&eacute;manteler le groupe ACP</B></I>. Cette quatri&egrave;me option d&eacute;note une approche plus radicale. Elle pr&eacute;suppose qu'il n'y aura plus d'accord-cadre de Lom&eacute;. Dans cette &eacute;ventualit&eacute;, l'UE n&eacute;gocierait probablement une nouvelle s&eacute;rie d'accords s&eacute;par&eacute;s avec chacune des trois r&eacute;gions du groupe ACP. Il serait &eacute;galement possible d'associer certains pays ACP &agrave; des arrangements existants (les Cara&iuml;bes, par exemple, pourraient &ecirc;tre englob&eacute;s dans un accord avec l'Am&eacute;rique centrale).

<P>

<H3>N&eacute;cessit&eacute; de recherches compl&eacute;mentaires</H3>

<P>

Les probl&eacute;matiques de la modification de la couverture g&eacute;ographique de Lom&eacute; et de la diff&eacute;renciation qui en r&eacute;sulte entre les pays et les r&eacute;gions ACP sont des questions vastes et complexes &eacute;minemment &agrave; l'ordre du jour.

<P>

Ces deux points constituent des priorit&eacute;s de l'agenda europ&eacute;en dans le d&eacute;bat sur l'apr&egrave;s-Lom&eacute; IV. La r&eacute;flexion sur ces questions est bien engag&eacute;e sans toutefois qu'une consultation tr&egrave;s approfondie n'ait eu lieu jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent avec les premiers    concern&eacute;s    par    les    changements    propos&eacute;s,    qu'ils    en   soient  &#171; b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires &#187; ou &#171; victimes &#187;.

<P>

Partant de cette analyse, il appara&icirc;t clairement que ce d&eacute;bat n'en est encore qu'au stade embryonnaire dans les pays ACP. La crainte de se voir davantage marginaliser emp&ecirc;che de nombreux acteurs ACP de consid&eacute;rer ouvertement les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices potentiels d'une red&eacute;finition de la couverture g&eacute;ographique de la Convention, quelle qu'elle soit. D'o&ugrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de proc&eacute;der &agrave; des recherches suppl&eacute;mentaires, y compris des recherches conjointes, sur les diff&eacute;rentes options et leurs cons&eacute;quences probables.

<A NAME="abstract"><hr><h3></A>Abstract</h3>



<I>This paper presents the current Danish aid policy as a product of a continuous balancing of general policy objectives against the specific organisation and management of the aid administration within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is pointed out that the basic framework for Danish aid has remained fairly stable throughout the last 2-3 decades. Poverty orientation, returns to Danish business enterprises, an equal distribution between bilateral and multilateral aid channels, and a strong emphasis on popular involvement with aid issues are recurring features of Danish aid policy. Thus, while aid discussions are popping up in public debates from time to time it is striking how little the overall objectives have changed.</I><P>



<I>

Still, the more specific Danish system of aid administration and management has changed considerable during recent years as a result of a complex balancing between internal ministerial interests and external demands on Danida. It is argued out that the outcome of this process varies over time and with regard to the respective aid issue areas. Furthermore, obviously the result is also a product of the relative strength and capacity that various actors can mobilise and master, both within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in Government at large and in Parliament, and within the broader aid policy community.</I><P>

<A NAME="1"><h3><hr>1. The Framework for Danish Aid Policy</h3>



This paper sets out to present the current Danish aid policy as a product of a continuous balancing of general policy objectives against the specific organisation and management of the aid administration within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<A HREF="#e1">(1.)</A> <A NAME="b1"></A>Trends in aid strategies, management and administration during recent years are analysed on the background of the general consensus-based aid policy-making that historically has characterised the issue area. The focus is on the impact exerted by the aid policy community on different aspects Danish aid policy and administration. In the first two sections the basic approach and philosophy for Danish aid is outlined followed by a presentation of current trends in Danish country programming. Subsequently, the Danida approach to the project management cycle is introduced. Following this are two sections on how Danish aid administration have approached the World Bank's policy-based lending, respectively recent trends within the EUs aid programmes. The paper concludes with a section on accountability for Danish aid.<P>



Danish aid policy can be viewed from different perspectives. In the only comprehensive analysis of Danish North-South policy, it is argued that this specific policy area can be seen as one element in the totality of Denmark's international relations (Holm 1982). In this perspective, aid policy is similar to general Danish foreign policy which is described as 'reactive balance policy'. The distinctive mark of this form of policy is that development policy, like general foreign policy, has to weigh the many demands and needs which originate both from the external environment and from the Danish society. <P>



It has been argued that aid programmes in the OECD countries more than other government activities have been subject to public concerns and allegations that tax money are squandered on dubious purposes. Furthermore, aid policy might be a field where many different constituencies seek to favour their respective ideals (Administrationsdepartementet 1986a:42).<P>



Thus, it can also be fruitful to look at development policy as a particular policy field which is characterized by the existence of strong norms and morally based attitudes. Seen in this perspective, one can perceive development policy as the specific sector of Danish foreign policy which deals with the normative aspects of the international system. By stressing the normative element, the understanding of development policy falls within the same framework as is used when small states in general are analysed. In relation to the reflections on small states, considerable emphasis is put on norm (giving) behaviour as a central determinant for foreign policy behaviour.<P>



In this context it has been suggested that the concept of &quot;humane internationalism&quot; can establish the necessary connection between domestic policy and international norm setting behaviour. Humane internationalism is defined as &quot;an acceptance that the citizens and governments of the industrialized world have ethical responsibilities towards those beyond their borders who are suffering severely and who live in abject poverty&quot; (Pratt 1990:5). The concept implies that idealistic attitudes and humanistic values are ascribed quite a central position in the understanding of goals and means in Danish aid policy. As the one of the key observers of Danish development policy, Knud Erik Svendsen, puts it what is unique about Danish development policy as a policy field is the fact that it is <I>

 'marked by idealism and therefore, it is more open towards arguments, that is to say, it is less tied to the common economic clash of interests</I>' (Svendsen 1981:11). <A HREF="#e2">(2.)</A><P><A NAME="b2"></A>



It has furthermore been argued that Danish development policy represents a continuation of domestic Danish welfare policies which put emphasis on income transfers as a central element in the redistribution between the rich and the poor. In that respect, the aid policy can be understood as a 'doubling' of or as a transfer of Danish welfare values to the international scene. The strength of these values is an important explanation of the high degree of continuity which has characterised Danish development aid policy since the early 1970s (Svendsen 1989; Svendsen 1995). The resilient nature of this basic development objective has recently been confirmed in the new aid strategy which the Danish Parliament passed in 1994 (Danida 1994d).<P>



The fact that ideological considerations probably have a particularly great significance in this policy-field does not exclude that the policy cannot be understood in the same way as other sectors of Danish politics. Older analyses of the Danish political system point out that Danish politics can be understood as divided up into a number of political sectors where the various actors connected to a specific policy area interact in rather firmly established patterns (Damgaard 1977; Damgaard &amp; Eliassen 1980). However, recent analyses indicate that this sectorisation of Danish politics was more pronounced in the 1960s and the 1970s than was the case in the late 1980s where the political system, was described as far more <I>

 'complex and anarchic'</I> (Christensen &amp; Christiansen 1992:29).<P>



While these more or less anarchic features of Danish politics in general have become more salient during recent years, the aid sector has shown a remarkable continuity concerning both the actors involved and the issues discussed. In spite of many public debates, what may be particularly striking is the fact that Danish foreign aid policy has changed so relatively little over the years. Hence, a recurrent feature of this policy field is the tendency to place development assistance above traditional (party) politics, although concessions have of course been made to various interest groups throughout the years (Svendsen 1995:41). Thus, a majority of as much as 80-90% of Parliament has often backed the current revisions of the Danish aid policy agenda during the - usually annual - debates in Parliament on development assistance. Probably, the reason for this continuity - in spite of upheavals in the policy environment - is the number of interested parties to be taken into consideration, thus making it difficult to produce more fundamental changes.<P>



The combination of self-interest and shared values of the most important participants in the aid policy process is tantamount to the existence of a so-called 'policy-community'. The participants in this community have all gained from participating in the policy process and from moderating their mutual disagreements. A policy-community is usually characterised by <I>

 the stability and the high degree of institutionalization of the relations between administration and organizations (which) primarily (is) a consequence of, and lead to the consequence of, a value community that is attached to the common understanding of what are the problems, and how they should be solved. Radical policy changes which are not accepted by all actors will therefore rarely be realizable within the framework of the existing organisation</I> (Christensen &amp; Christiansen 1992:94).<P>



Politicians, and probably also civil servants as well as most other interested parties, have agreed on the desirability of winning the broadest possible support for Danish aid. Political compromise has thus become the hallmark of aid policy making. The emphasis has been on the broad humanitarian aspects of aid rather than explicitly stated political objectives that might have implied reduced backing from influential parts of the policy community. The prevailing consensus in Danish aid policy making can probably be seen as an indication of the strength of humanistic attitudes in Danish society which has found its external expression in the 'humane internationalism' mentioned.<P>



The significance of ideology in forming Danish development policy does not, of course, exclude the possibility of specific economic and political interests influencing both the form and the content of the policy. It has been argued that the Danish aid constituency can be categorised into three different groupings with a number of overlaps that have allowed for their continued coexistence and parallel influences on policy formulation and implementation (Svendsen 1995:42). The first group is composed of the broader popular aid constituency championing the above-mentioned normative aid objectives and building on alliances between aid professionals among NGOs, research institutes, Danida etc. Secondly, Danish business interests have been influential in securing and preserving quite substantial 'rates of return' to Danish companies etc. by maintaining various models of tied aid (cf. Svendsen 1981; Boel 1986; Martinussen 1989). Finally, a somewhat more loose grouping of actors closer to Government and Parliament have insisted to perceive Danish support for international development cooperation as an integral part of the general foreign policy.<P>



While the existence of a particular 'aid policy community' as argued above has served to maintain a remarkable consensus around foreign aid, the indirect outcome (or 'costs') of this coexistence of competing demands has led to a complexity of more or less independent objectives. These aims may be conflicting in the sense that substantial trade-offs may occur, but the various objectives may also differ with regard to the clarity by which they are formulated and presented to the aid administration. Finally, conflicts may occur between the explicit and implicit agendas for development assistance (Administrationsdepartementet 1986a:10).This situation is not unique to Danish aid as it is found among many official aid agencies who are facing a number of inconsistent norms (cf. Carlsson, K&ouml;hlin &amp; Ekbom 1994:38). However, it is an important feature to emphasise as it serves to make the policy base of Danish development cooperation a rather bulky affair that puts high demands on the political and administrative management of Danish development assistance.

<P>

<B><A NAME="2">2. Approach and Philosophy</B>

<P>

Two basic principles have been influential in shaping Danish development assistance. First, since the late-1960s it has been agreed to divide Danish aid on a fifty-fifty basis between multilateral and bilateral assistance, and in general favouring the UN organisations in this context. This strong support for multilateralism stems from two inter-related issues: since Denmark had no experiences from former colonies, the nation should rely on and assist UN efforts in this field. Furthermore, the basic Danish position in the international system as a small state led to a strong support for international cooperation.<P>



Secondly, the volume of aid relative to GDP has been significantly higher than most OECD-members for more than two decades, surpassing the average DAC-level since the early 1970s, reaching app. 0.7% of GDP in 1978 and stabilising at the current target of 1% of GDP in 1992. This reflected Danish support for international resource transfers to bridge the gap between North and South and a political commitment to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GDP. In 1985 a parliamentary majority agreed to reach the target of 1% of GDP in 1992, a decision that implied a rapid growth in aid budgets during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, in response to debates on the need for additional resources to finance environmentally sustainable development (in relation to UNCED etc.) and influenced by the rapidly increasing demands for emergency assistance, Parliament decided on a new and additional budget framework outside the aid appropriations. According to the agreement the appropriation will reach 0.5% of GDP in 2002, and the amount will be equally divided between international environmental assistance (to developing countries as well as to Eastern Europe) and emergency assistance, mainly pre-asylum expenditures for refugees coming to Denmark. <A HREF="#e3">(3.)</A><P><A NAME="b3"></A>

It is remarkable, especially in an international context, that Danish development assistance have not only been able to avoid budget cuts but that substantial growth rates have also been achieved in a decade during which other government activities have had to accept significant budgetary constraints. While 'Ministry of Finance' logic has impeded on most of the public sector, it was only in 1993 that the first major analysis of budgetary tendencies in Danish development assistance were analysed by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by the Finance Ministry (Finansministeriet 1993). Furthermore, the rationale behind aid to developing countries (and the lead role in this respect of Ministry of Foreign Affairs) was generally accepted, while in areas such as support for Eastern Europe or environmental assistance the Ministry of Finance insisted on a more prominent role.<P>



Since 1971, the overall objectives of Danish development assistance have been embodied in 'Act No. 297 on International Development Cooperation' (with subsequent revisions). <A HREF="#e4">(4.)</A><A NAME="b4"></A> According to the Act <I>

 the objective of Denmark's official assistance to developing countries is - in collaboration with governments and authorities of these countries - to support their endeavours to achieve economic growth in order in this way to contribute to securing social progress and political independence in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.</I>Subsequent parliamentary revisions of this Act have mainly served to update and adjust the legal framework for Danish development cooperation, while the basic objective has remained unchanged for more than two decades.<P>



In 1982 a Government appointed Commission on development cooperation was split on the need for revising the aid objectives. A majority argued in favour of specifying that Danish aid should be targeted towards enduring improvements in the living conditions of poor groups of the population and that Danish assistance mainly should be given to the poorer LDCs. During the subsequent parliamentary debate, a majority supported the Commission minority in the view that the existing (1971) broad statement of objectives was the most appropriate to allow for a continuous adjustment of the principles to accommodate for new experiences gained in development cooperation (1987:170).<P>



As referred to in the introductory section, Danish aid policy has generally been perceived of as an integrated element of Danish foreign policy emphasising the need for international cooperation and norm setting in a global environment characterised by both anarchy, economic interdependence and limited policy margins for small states like Denmark. During the 1980s other foreign policy areas such as European integration and defence and military security became rather contentious areas in parliamentary debates, <A NAME="b5"></A><A HREF="#e5">(5.)</A> while aid policy remained an area of consensus seeking. The position of aid policy within the general foreign policy was seldomly made very explicit, though, and with the creation of Danida in 1986 as an independent administrative department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs there was subsequently a tendency for aid policy to develop its own momentum.<P>



The reorganisation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1991 and the arrival of a new government in early 1993 implied some changes in this situation, illustrated by the preparation of an extensive Government memorandum on principles and perspectives for Danish foreign policy after the termination of the cold war (Udenrigsministeriet 1993). In this document, development policy is linked to broader areas such as global environment, debt crisis, and human rights. Still, the presentation of specific trends and perspectives for Danish aid policy takes up only a minor portion of the paper, a situation that the 1994 aid strategy sought to redress. The preparation of the paper was an intra-ministerial process without the participation of the aid policy community, but in addition to being presented to Parliament the completed memorandum was debated at a public meeting with inputs from key actors in Danish foreign policy.<P>



With regular intervals Parliament has debated the objectives of Danish aid, usually in the form of moving a motion requesting the Government to include one or several new objectives in the future design and implementation of the aid programme. In doing so, Parliament has traditionally been influenced by new trends in international development cooperation with a outspoken sensitivity to the contemporary UN development agenda. Hence, issues such as 'rural development', 'basic human needs', 'women in development', 'environment', 'human rights', 'indigenous people', and 'population' have been emphasised by broad parliamentary majorities. <A NAME="b6"></A><A HREF="#e6">(6.)</A> Since the mid-1980s a number of policy papers have sought to outline Danish positions in fields such as women in development, environment, and democracy &amp; human rights. <A HREF="#e7">(7.)</A> <A NAME="b7"></A><P>



The 1994-strategy defines these three areas as 'cross-cutting themes' which have to be pursued at all levels within the Danish aid programme. They are not mentioned in any order of priority in the 1994 strategy. Altogether one chapter (25 out of 100 pages in the full strategy) is devoted to a presentation of a total of seven thematic priority areas: poverty, women, population, environment, trade, debt relief, and promotion of democratisation &amp; human rights. Of these, population, trade and debt relief are 'new comers', while the others represent a continuation of current practice. It has generally been left to Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to draw up the respective strategies, most often in collaboration with various sections of the aid policy community. <P>



It is apparent that until very recently neither the Danish aid administration within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <A NAME="b8"></A><A HREF="#e8">(8.)</A>nor others have tried to define more specifically how Danida's activities can and/or have contribute(d) to poverty alleviation, the overall objective for Danish aid since the 1970s (Sano 1993:27). The most current aid strategy maintains the position of poverty alleviation as the overarching objective of Danish development assistance, albeit in a somewhat more detailed and outspoken, programmatic manner than has previously been the case. Poverty alleviation is now perceived as based on a) labour intensive economic growth; b) investments in human resources; and c) good governance and popular participation (note that the last leg of the strategy differs from the World Bank's focus on social safety nets). <P>



Prior to the 1994 strategy paper the poverty alleviation objective has traditionally been operationalised in terms of a focus on low-income countries, on support for social sector development and, occasionally, on support for deprived local areas (e.g. integrated rural development programmes). Hence, so far operational guidelines to e.g. define different groups of poor people or suggestions to target assistance to a certain percentage of the absolute poor have not been prepared. It is currently argued that the implementation of the general poverty strategy will be an integral component of the formulation of country strategies (cf. below) and will appear explicitly in these. Previously, the Government has rejected calls for an explicit and operational poverty alleviation strategy, but work is currently under way with regard to reviewing past performance in the poverty field and including attempts to formulate an actual policy in this area.<P>

Generally, neither Parliament nor the Danida management have placed the various aid objectives in any order of priority apart from the general commitment to poverty orientation as mentioned above. This seems to be a recurrent source of frustration and tension in the design and implementation of individual projects and in country programming as it is left to individual departmental sections and staff members within the Ministry to define the actual priorities for a particular intervention.<P>



According to the Act on international development cooperation, the main planning instrument for Danish aid policy implementation is the so-called 'rolling five year plan'. This report is prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and presented to Parliament. Usually, however, the plan does not serve as a motivation or specific 'platform' for debates in Parliament on aid policy issues. Formally speaking the Act requests the Minister to present the budget framework for future aid expenditures, but since 1989 (following the presentation of the Danida Plan of Action) the document has come to include more policy oriented analyses and statements, in addition to the mere budgetary projections that had been the case previously. Currently the plan includes 1-2 pages on each programme country and the major multilaterals with app. half of the text presenting a general picture of the country/organisation while the other half is devoted to listing particular Danish objectives and perspectives. <A NAME="b9"></A><A HREF="#e9">(9.)</A><P>



In 1988 'Danida's Plan of Action' was presented to supplement the annual rolling five year plan (Danida 1988). It had a five year perspective and appeared as the culmination of a strategic planning effort that had been initiated subsequent to a major study on Danish aid administration and management (Administrationsdepartementet 1986). <A NAME="10"></A><A HREF="#e10">(10.)</A> Hence the Plan of Action was the first major policy document to appear after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was reorganised in 1986 to uplift 'Danida' to one of three departmental units in the ministry. Contrary to the rolling five year plans, the Plan of Action did not dwell at e.g. budgetary matters such as allocations between individual recipient countries but rather pointed at the need to focus Danish bilateral assistance on 20-25 programme countries, hence abandoning the four 'main cooperation countries' concept' that had been adhered to for app. two decades (Bangladesh, Kenya, India, and Tanzania). Furthermore the Plan of Action argued in favour of a more activist Danish position in multilateral development cooperation and a set of criteria for deciding on Danish budget allocations to the international organisations were presented.<P>



The paper was the result of a major intra-ministerial planning process initiated in 1987. It had included the preparation of eight sub-reports (on the perspectives for Danish development cooperation in various countries/geographic regions and with regard to the multilateral organisations). As such there was substantially less involvement of the aid policy community than had been the previous practice with regard to aid policy formulation. Hence, <I> the till then existing aggregation and compromise creating mechanisms had been suspended</I>, although considerable consideration was being made to especially Danish commercial interests (Martinussen 1989:256). <A NAME="11"></A><A HREF="#e11">(11.)</A> The decisive difference compared to previous exercises was, however, the fact that the aid administration was now taking the initiative rather than reacting to outside pressure. The public and parliamentary debate on the Plan of Action focused to a large extent on the controversial choice of programme countries and the weighing out of middle- and low-income countries (cf. section 3 in this paper) while most other elements in the paper received support or were not explicitly debated.<P>



In 1994 the document 'A World in Development - Strategy for Danish Development Policy towards the Year 2000' took the place of the Plan of Action that had by then exceeded its original five year perspective (Danida 1994d). <A NAME="12"></A><A HREF="#e12">(12.)</A>  It is important to note, though, that the new aid strategy was not formulated on the background of an analysis of the experiences with the previous Plan of Action (Ewers 1994:37). It was prepared in continuation of the 1993 foreign policy memorandum to adjust Danish development policies to the new global situation emerging from the profound global changes which have taken place since 1989. As such it is an ambitious document that seeks to address the need for policy coherence in Denmark's relations with developing countries including aid recipients. Hence 'development policy' is meant to encompass <I>

 all our relations with developing countries, economic and political as well as multilateral and bilateral</I>, although aid policies still attracts the main attention in the paper Danida 1994d:ii). <A NAME="13"></A><A HREF="#e13">(13.)</A><P>



Contrary to the 1988 paper, the new strategy was the result of a deliberate 'open door' policy where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited comments from NGOs, business interests, researchers etc. during various stages of the preparation of the document. Hence, this process served to confirm and indeed promote the existence of the aid policy community (or the 'Danish resource base' as ministerial terminology has it), i.a. in the sense that a number of potentially controversial issues had been resolved prior to the finalisation of the document and its presentation to Parliament (Ewers 1994:37).<P>



This was most pronounced with regard to outlining the roles of Danish business and Danish NGOs respectively in overall Danish development cooperation. Here, the Ministry had established two working groups with representatives from the respective parts of the aid policy community to formulate specific strategies on these issues. The results of the working group efforts were published as independent strategies in separate volumes (Danida 1993e, 1993f, 1993g, 1993h) and a summary was included in the 'main strategy' without any alterations. In these fields the strategy is rather innovative and sets out a series of new objectives that includes also Danida demands on private enterprises and NGOs to ensure that they strengthen their capacities for a long-term development engagement with specific identities distinct from those of official development cooperation.<P>



In other areas the strategy represents a continuation of existing policies, e.g. with regard to focusing Danish bilateral assistance to 20 programme countries and in relation to seeking to develop a more proactive stance vis-&agrave;-vis multilateral organisations, the so-called active multilateralism. Despite a number of policy statements to the contrary, these two policy initiatives did not really seem to get off the ground following the adoption of the Plan of Action by Parliament in 1989, although the number of programme countries were gradually increased from 12 in 1989 to 20 in 1994. However, a combination of administrative and business interests appear to have been successful in arguing for a rather long-term phase out process in several other countries to whom bilateral assistance had been extended during the 1980s. With regard to increasing general policy dialogue and putting pressure to bear on the multilaterals, the problem appear to have been both lack of ministerial staff resources and - more importantly - the need to first develop a methodology to assess the effectiveness of various international organisations. <A NAME="14"></A><A HREF="#e14">(14.)</A><P>



In the follow-up to the 1994-strategy it appears, though, that more decisive action has now been taken. Apart from nine countries receiving transitional assistance, the remaining aid to countries not among the 20 programme countries will be phased out during the next five years. In addition a Plan of Action for Active Multilateralism has recently been prepared indicating organisation specific objectives to improve the performance of international organisations receiving Danish aid (Danida 1994c).<P>



A novel feature of the 1994 strategy was the proposal to base Danish bilateral assistance mainly on 'sector programme assistance' by concentrating on 3-4 sectors within each of the programme countries. This appears to have a several functions. First, it seeks to enable the Danish aid administration to build up more focused administrative expertise in key areas compared to a situation with a highly diversified country programme portfolio. Secondly, it is hoped that this formula will be instrumental in moving away from the long- standing dominance of project assistance in Danish bilateral aid. <A NAME="15"></A><A HREF="#e15">(15.)</A> It is decided that the selection of sectors will be made on a country basis in connection with the current process of formulating country strategies for each of the 20 countries. The overall objective is to pave the way for a greater integration of external assistance into policies and programmes of recipient countries, hence improving ownership.<P>



On the other hand one can argue that the 'programme country' and 'sector programme assistance' concepts together with the notion of 'active multilateralism' are all illustrations of an underlying current in Danish aid policy to move away from traditional 'neutrality' positions towards using aid as a lever to influence recipient country policies. Up through the 1960s and 1970s the combination of a strongly project focused organisation and the strong support for the UN system had implied a rather responsive position vis-&agrave;-vis developing countries both within the UN system <A NAME="16"></A><A HREF="#e16">(16.)</A>and in the bilateral aid programme. Partly influenced by the generally changing aid relations during the 1980s, partly as an implicit consequences of e.g. elaborating criteria for the choice of programme countries, the 1994-strategy served to confirm a more pronounced Danish position. The full effect of these tendencies are yet uncertain, but they will certainly serve to further politicise domestic aid debates, as argued in the next section.<P>



Compared to the approach pursued in 1988 the intensive involvement of the aid policy community in the strategy preparation during 1993-94 took place at the expense of intra-ministerial participation (Therkildsen 1994:6). Whereas in 1987-88 work groups had been established throughout the Danida structure, work with the 1994 strategy directly involved only a small handful of senior staff in the Ministry. <A NAME="17"></A><A HREF="#e17">(17.)</A>Hence, one may conclude that ministerial 'ownership' of the strategy is less outspoken today than in 1988 when Danida staff at several levels had been involved. This tendency may be particularly manifest with regard to implementing the new sector programme assistance concept that requires ministerial staff to move away from what has so far been a strongly project focused organisational setup (cf. Ewers 1994:39). One should note, though, that the extra-ordinary amount of staff resources spent in 1987/88 in many ways made it 'a unique exercise' that could not be repeated at regular intervals (Danida 1993b:3)<P>



One further effect of opening-up the policy-formulation process is a less consistent and more all-inclusive paper which is more of a listing of varying objectives than a strategy setting clear priorities and outlining a distinct goal hierarchy. On the other hand the early and strong involvement of the aid policy community prepared the way for a much smoother and less antagonistic public and parliamentary debate compared to the situation in 1988-89.<P>

Since 1989 Danish aid policies have emphasised that bilateral assistance would be focused on 20-25 programme countries.<A NAME="18"></A> <A HREF="#e18">(18.)</A>This objective stands out as a contrast to the situation prevailing from the early 1970s when four 'main recipient countries' (India, Bangladesh, Kenya and Tanzania) had accounted for 2/3 or more of bilateral project aid while the remaining share was widely dispersed. <A NAME="19"></A><A HREF="#e19">(19.)</A>The 'programme country' concept was part of the 1988 Danida Plan of Action, and while the notion as such was generally supported, the criteria for the choice of programme countries and the countries suggested in the Plan of Action was the source of considerable public and parliamentary debate. The Parliament's Foreign Committee in 1989 identified seven criteria that has so far remained the basis for the selection of 20 programme countries during recent years:<P>

<ol>

<li>the level of economic and social development and the development needs of the country and its own development objectives;<P>



<li>the supply of aid from other bilateral and multilateral donors and the capability of the country of utilizing and benefitting from aid;<P>



<li>the possibility of promoting sustainable development, defined by the Committee as a development which also in the long run will be economical and ecological warrantable, and which aims at bringing about lasting improvements for the poorest population groups;<P>



<li>the possibility of promoting the advance of and respect for human rights;<P>



<li>the possibility of ensuring women's issues a central and fully integrated position in the development process;<P>



<li>Danida's experiences from previous bilateral assistance;<P>



<li>Finally, the Committee stated that provided that the abovementioned points have been considered, the possibilities for promoting the participation of the Danish business sector - and in doing so Danish employment - should be taken into consideration. However, this should be on the basis that Danish deliveries and services would be competitive with regard to appropriate technology, price and quality.

</ol>

<P>

The Committee report emphasises the importance of being able to address issues such as human rights, sustainable development, and women's issues in collaboration with authorities of the programme countries. The Parliament Committee did not suggest changes in the long standing policy that bilateral assistance would only be given to countries with a GDP/capita of two thirds of the World Bank limit for long-term credits (currently USD 1,855). In practice, though, the vast majority of programme countries for Danish bilateral assistance are all low-income economies.

The process to concentrate on 20 countries for the major part of bilateral assistance was initiated in 1989, subsequent to the presentation of the Danida Plan of Action, with the choice of the first 12 programme countries. Only in June 1994 was the process completed with the selection of Ethiopia, Niger and Bolivia. <A NAME="20"></A><A HREF="#e20">(20.)</A> The 20 countries (excluding Thailand) received a total of 64,2% (DKK 2,9 bill) of bilateral aid allocated in budgetary 1994.<A NAME="21"></A> <A HREF="#e21">(21.)</A>Comparing the 1994 figures with the ten year average column one notes that Nepal is the only newcomer as the 7th main recipient (3,7% of bilateral assistance), while China is the only country from the 1985-94 figures not figuring among the top ten in 1994. Although the relative positions have changed during the period, this is still indicative of the strong continuity in Danish bilateral assistance. The table also points to the significant reductions in aid to the four previous 'main recipient countries' towards the current situation which appear more conducive for flexible country programming.<P>



Danish bilateral assistance is dispersed on a number of different purposes, implying that out of the total budget for bilateral aid only 55% is allocated for official bilateral assistance in the 20 programme countries (DKK 2,655m. out of 4,857 m. in 1995). <A NAME="22"></A><A HREF="#e22">(22.)</A>Thus, the average budget framework for each country programme is around USD 24 m. The remaining amount is mainly spent on bilateral assistance in other countries (including transitional assistance), other technical assistance programmes, support for NGOs, external consultants, the mixed credit programme, and asylum seekers in Denmark. After some years with substantial growth rates it is now agreed that government support for Danish NGOs should be in the range of app. 17% of the total budget framework available for bilateral project assistance (in 1994 this amounted to app. DKK 600 m.).<P>



The main pressures to extend bilateral aid outside the 20 country programmes stem from three main sources. First, Danish business interests tend to argue that their best export markets are not low- income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, but rather some of the fast growing East and South-East Asian countries. The choice of programme countries during recent years has confirmed the tendency for traditional business interests to 'loose the battle' when new programme countries are being introduced, cf. the predominance of low-income countries. In the Danish context e.g Thailand and Egypt are often considered 'too wealthy' to qualify for Danish aid money. At a more general level, private companies seem to fear lack of flexibility in their access to aid funds if major shares of bilateral aid is tied to use in a limited number of programme countries. <A NAME="23"></A><A HREF="#e23">(23.)</A>The introduction in 1993 of a mixed credit scheme seems to have satisfied at least some of the business critics, though, as this facility will be available in developing countries with a GDP/capita below USD 2,230 irrespective of their status as Danida programme countries. <A NAME="24"></A><A HREF="#e24">(24.)</A><P>



General foreign policy motives appear as a second reason for extending Danish bilateral assistance outside the 20 country programmes. Both Government, parliamentary foreign policy spokesmen, and various NGOs tend to see aid money as flexible funds that can be used to 'reward' promising development trends in individual developing countries. The aid strategy therefore includes the concept of 'transitional assistance' to be employed in such situations. Currently, such programmes have been established in eight countries with a total amount of DKK 5,578 m. for programmes of typically 3-5 years duration with implementation often involving Danish NGOs, the Danish business sector and a number of multilateral organisations.<A NAME="25"></A> <A HREF="#e25">(25.)</A><P>



Finally, the tables presented above are clear indications of the general budgetary pressures emerging from fiscal policy and exerted on the bilateral aid budget in recent years with regard to financing the rapidly growing expenditures for asylum seekers from developing countries. In 1990 it was decided with retroactive effect for the period 1987-89 that Danida would apply DAC rules allowing expenditures related to reception of asylum seekers from developing countries to be categorised as ODA. These expenditures then grew rapidly until in 1993 it was agreed to gradually phase out such payments from the aid budget in the period 1993-98 and to let the new budget for environmental and emergency assistance finance these activities. <P>



Thus, the current general allocation of the bilateral aid budget can in some ways be seen as a direct expression of the 'costs' related to the continuous involvement of the aid policy community in policy formulation and implementation. However, pressures are also exerted on the aid administration during the process of drawing up country strategies as will debated below.<P>



<B><A NAME="3.2"></A>3.2 Donor procedures for country programming</B><P>



Traditionally, Danish bilateral aid has mainly be extended in the form of project aid and technical assistance while programme aid has taken up a significantly smaller share than most other like-minded donors. Furthermore, strategic planning was only introduced in Danida from 1987 and onwards. Thus, prior to the previously mentioned intra-departmental planning process in 1987/88, country programming was essentially reactive and based on project proposals emerging from field staff and others. Danida management would promote those ideas that was felt to be in line with current aid policies while discouraging others. During annual negotiations with recipient authorities focus would mainly be on project specific issues, while a proactive approach to country programming was virtually absent from Danida (Administrationsdepartementet 1986c:14-15).<P>



In continuation of the 1988 Plan of Action considerably more work was initiated with regard to preparation of country analyses and strategies. It is, however, remarkable that Danida chose to contract external consultants to prepare the first range of reports rather than relying on in-house staff. This may be explained as a combination of lack of ministerial capacity (both staff availability and experiences with general policy analysis), fear of conflictual relations to recipient authorities in case touchy issues would be included in the reports, and the general politicization of the choice of Danida programme countries since 1989. As a follow-up to this the Danida management in 1992 initiated a new strategic planning process with the preparation of 4-6 country strategies annually starting in 1993. While a consultation with the aid policy community was included in the plans, emphasis was put on internalising the planning process within the ministry (Danida 1993b:9-10).<P>



These plans were to a certain extent overtaken by the rapid preparation of the 1994 aid strategy in the sense that the new orientation inherent in the strategy caused a revision of the original timetable to allow for a faster completion of the process. Furthermore, during the course of 1993/94 several new countries were chosen as programme countries. Finally, the strategy placed considerably more emphasis on involving recipient authorities and the Danish aid policy community.<P>



The aid strategy envisages that for each of the 20 programme countries, a country strategy will be drawn on the basis of an overall assessment of the national economic and political situation. The country strategies are required to set out guidelines for the overall allocation of bilateral assistance, the concentration on and allocation of bilateral assistance between a limited number of sectors and the cross-cutting themes. The country strategy process is devised to enable consultation with both recipient government authorities and actors among the Danish 'resource base', i.e. private companies, NGOs, research institutes etc. with potential knowledge about and interest in a particular country. It is currently expected that the country strategies will be updated on a regular basis and revised every 4-5 years (Danida 1994d:12-13). Currently, 7 have been prepared while an additional 6 are near completion. The first round will come to an end in 1996 when the remaining 7 strategies have been finalised. Upon completion all strategies are publicly available and translated into the national language of the respective programme country.<P>



So far the country strategy process has been rather uneven, both with regard to the involvement of actors external to the Ministry and concerning the content and approach of the individual papers. In the Regional Departments there is still some uncertainty with regard to country programming and consequently also with regard to prioritising the drafting of country strategies. Some strategies have been finalised mainly by Danida staff prior to the presentation to Danish actors and to recipient authorities. Only in a few countries has the process included workshops with local resource persons to identify e.g. key development needs of the particular country before the various strategy elements were compiled. The papers also differ quite considerably with regard to the treatment of cross-cutting themes in Danish aid, e.g. poverty. <P>



Reports from the strategies completed so far indicate that the choice of sectors have been subject to internal ministerial debates as well as to a rather intense politicization from various actors in the aid policy community. This is not surprising since subsequent to the completion of the choice of programme countries the sectoral priorities are currently perceived to be the only major possibility left to influence the future direction of Danish bilateral aid. NGOs and representatives from the business community have clashed in debates on choosing between social sectors perceived to be more poverty oriented on the one hand and infrastructure and productive sectors on the other hand believed to assure higher returns to Danish companies.<P>



Previously, reports from annual negotiations provided the Danida board with the opportunity to comment ex-post on the future profile of Danish aid in a particular country. So far, however, there has been no central mechanism to ensure ex-ante that general aid objectives were actually satisfactorily reflected in the individual country programme portfolio. This may change with the new country strategies, since they are presented in draft formats to the Danida board subsequent to being debated with the Danish actors and recipient government authorities. Furthermore, the papers are also presented to the Parliament Foreign Committee.

<A NAME="3.3"></A>3.3 Sectoral distribution and sector policies for Danish aid</B><P>



During recent years the sectoral distribution of Denmark's bilateral aid seen a decline in aid to 'productive sectors' and 'economic infrastructur' while 'social infrastructure' has maintained a high share of total bilateral aid. Public health, agriculture, transport, and water supply &amp; sanitation stand out as major sectors during the first half of the 1990s, accounting for app. 1/3 of bilateral assistance on average during 1992-94. The declining figures for productive sectors and economic infrastructure are i.a. a result of changes in the tying procedures for Danish aid agreed upon in 1988. Prior to 1989 high shares were achieved in e.g. agriculture, industry and energy as a result of the tying of aid to these sectors to Danish deliveries.<A NAME="26"></A> <A HREF="#e26">(26.)</A><P>



The 1994 aid strategy contains specific mentioning of the following areas as priority sectors for future Danish assistance: agriculture, natural resource management &amp; food production; infrastructure; social sectors (including water &amp; sanitation); and the private sector. It further states that the shares of productive sectors and of economic infrastructure will be increased, while aid to the social sectors will be maintained at the current levels (Danida 1994d:21-27).<P>



Since 1993 a number of 'Danida Sector Policies' have been prepared covering the following sectors: energy, fisheries, health, forestry &amp; agroforestry, vocational education &amp; training, water supply &amp; sanitation. A paper on agriculture is currently being prepared. In addition a number of environmental 'issues papers' were prepared in 1989 on environmental issues in 'human health', 'fisheries development' and 'agriculture &amp; humid areas'. The formulation of sector based policies has occasionally been the cause of tensions between the 'Technical Advisory Service' (TSA), who have been in charge of drafting the papers, and the Danida Policy Department. Generally, the tendency seems for the Department for Policy &amp; Planning and the respective regional departments to gain increasing influence in decisions on sector priorities and country portfolio design, while TSA focuses increasingly on issues related to project design and periodic project reviews. The current move towards sector programme assistance may change this division of labour, although the modalities for planning and implementation of the new form of aid are yet to be clearly resolved.

<P>



Increased sector concentration and more emphasis on general programming and policy issues rather than project interventions appear reasonable in an attempt to improve impact by achieving the necessary 'critical mass' of resources and professional expertise in the aid efforts. However, four critical observations with regard to the concentration on key sectors should also be made at this stage. First, it must be assumed that the final result of the current country strategy process will be highly diversified in terms of both a relatively high number of total sectors where Denmark will be active, and with regard to how sectors and sector programme assistance is defined and delimited. Thus, while country programming may improve at the level of individual programme countries this does not necessarily imply an easing of the pressures at the level of central Danida management.<P>



Second, it appears plausible that Danish interests (particularly in the aid administration and among the business community) will have a significantly greater say in actual sector choice than those of recipient authorities. Thus, despite the generally increased transparency in the country strategy process, one may experience less openness and more hidden agendas when it comes to linking sector choices to the objective of securing Danish supplies as a result of bilateral aid. While explicit concerns for increasing the returns to Danish business have seldomly been made explicit during the process so far, it is evident that the choice of sectors is an important means to achieving this objective. The difficult art of balancing Danish commercial interests with other aid objectives remains an issue in Danish aid administration despite the 1994 strategy and its emphasis on developing new aid modalities.<P>



Third, parallel to experiences from the country concentration phases it is to be expected that it will take time before the sector concentration is reflected in budgetary allocations. Despite good intensions there is still considerable 'informal pressure' from missions abroad, from the business community, from Government etc. to maintain a certain 'flexibility' rather than to tie rather than to predetermine the use of every available krone.<P>



Finally, general tendencies in recipient countries and among official donor organisations may also imply less room for manoeuvre for Danida at the sectoral levels. This emphasises the need for Danish aid to identify and exploit existing and potential comparative advantages as well for establishing effective links between sector and project interventions on the one hand and general policy dialogue on the other hand (cf. Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1994b:75f).

<P>

<B><A NAME="3.4"></A>3.4 Relations to other donors and recipient governments</B>

<P>



Denmark takes part in co-ordination in a number of settings such as World Bank Consultative Groups, UNDP Round Tables, within the European Community, between the Nordic countries and on ad hoc basis with varying groups of donors, with a primary emphasis on the 20 programme countries and in particular where embassies have been established. While resident missions are expected to take an active role in liaising with other donors, there are no general guidelines and the picture varies considerably between the 20 programme countries. This depends not only on the effectiveness of the donor coordination set-up (particularly the capacity and priorities of the World Bank resident mission), recipient government attitudes vis-&agrave;-vis donors' 'ganging-up', but also on the relative size of the Danish country portfolio compared to other donors, and interests among individuals at the Danish embassies. Generally, the move towards country programming has meant a greater awareness of seeing Danish aid in relation to other donors.<P>



In recent years, Danida has gradually put somewhat more emphasis on participation in the policy dialogue concerning macro-economic issues, particularly within the framework of the World Bank's Special Programme of Assistance for Africa (SPA). These efforts are primarily initiated by the Danida administration in Copenhagen but may also involve resident missions in the programme countries. One such example is participation in public expenditure reviews with the view to ensuring realistic allocations for the social sectors. On the other hand, staff at local missions may often take the lead in involving Danida in the preparation of sectoral master plans to support the policy framework and capacity of local line ministries. Such work will often take place between a smaller group of bilateral donors and 1-2 multilaterals. <P>



The decision to concentrate Danish aid on fewer sectors in programme countries is expected to be accompanied by more intensified policy dialogue at the sector level with the recipient authorities.Guidelines are currently under preparation. Currently, annual negotiations take place between Danish and recipient authorities on progress made with regard to implementing the country portfolio and particular problem-areas (often related to individual projects). The negotiations take place in recipient capitals with a Danish delegation headed by senior officials from Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Copenhagen assisted by staff from the local Danish embassy.

<P>

<B><A NAME="3.5"></A>3.5 The future course of Danish country programming and implementation</B><P>



The general trend in country programming of Danish aid is towards an increasing politicization compared to previously when country portfolios were mainly the product of the aid administration promoting individual project proposals while others were discouraged. The drafting of country strategies and the choice of sector focus both imply a more open and aggregated presentation of how general Danish aid objectives is sought to be achieved. In turn this implies an increasing externalisation of country programming and implementation compared to the previous situation where the Danida administration would act rather autonomously. Thus, one may in the future witness a situation with fewer general policy debates (on tied aid, poverty alleviation, environment etc.) and an increase in discussions of specific country and sector programmes that are felt not to be in line with the various objectives among the policy community. <P>



A trend towards more country and sector focused debates may also change the role of the aid policy community as more this will demands on the actors for more specific information and experience as well as more capability to combine this insight with analyses of general trends in Danish aid. In general, the increased emphasis on country and sector programming in Danish aid may imply less possibility to shift priorities and focus with short notice as the more strategic planning will require more long-term commitments.<P>



It has also been argued, though, that it is a recurrent feature for official aid administrations to constantly move back and forth between professional and internal demands for country and sector concentration on the one hand and external, political and commercial pressures for expanding the number of recipient countries and/or sectors. The decisive issue in this case is for the aid administration to adopt a sufficiently flexible programming system to accommodate for these conflicting tendencies (Bruszt, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990:51).

<P>

<B><A NAME="4"></A>4. Project Management Cycle</B>

<P>



During the last decade one has witnessed increasing attempts to professionalise Danish development assistance. Expanding aid volumes, growing number of tasks put out for tenders to Danish private companies and a higher degree of decentralisation of authority away from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Copenhagen to Danish embassies and from there to individual project implementation bodies are among the factors underlining the need for more coherent concepts and more streamlined administrative procedures. It is no matter for surprise that such efforts have been dominated by ministerial initiatives, whereas the aid policy community in general have not been involved or concerned with these issues.<A NAME="27"></A> <A HREF="#e27">(27.)</A><P>



Contrary to other European aid administrations there is no central administrative body that controls all project proposals. However, all proposals are presented to Danida's Board (an autonomous entity with 9 members appointed to advice the Minister) prior to submission to the Parliament's Finance Committee. All projects exceeding DKK 5 m must be approved by the Board, while all spending above DKK 20 m. goes to the Parliamentary Finance Committee for approval. <P>



The various guidelines for project management are based on the Logical Framework Approach (LFA) which is presented to Ministry staff and external consultants etc. in Danida's Logical Framework Handbook. The Danida Project Management Cycle is comparable to that of several other bilateral aid agencies and it is divided into the following three stages: project preparation, project implementation, and project completion. <A NAME="28"></A><A HREF="#e28">(28.)</A>Responsibility for revising and updating the various guidelines rests with Danida's evaluation unit.

<P>

<B><I>1. Project preparation</B></I> includes identification, project formulation, pre-appraisal, feasibility studies, project appraisal and appropriation. Key documents to be employed during this phase includes the 'project proposal document' that is a standardised presentation of a given project on the basis of project identification and project formulation. Furthermore a 'project document' is required on the basis of the appraisal report and additional comments from the cooperation country and from Danida. The project document forms the basis of decision-making by the appropriation authorities, and it also includes the 'project implementation plan'. The project preparation phase is concluded with a Government Agreement or a Letter of Understanding signed by authorities in the Cooperation Country and Danida.

<P>



<B><I>2. Project implementation</B></I> is to be based on 'Annual Plans of Action', current monitoring and periodic project reviews. In general the responsibility for monitoring project implementation has been delegated from the Ministry in Copenhagen to local Danish embassy officials in collaboration with the project implementing organisation. The task of preparing and carrying out project reviews lies with the Technical Advisory Service in the Ministry in Copenhagen, though. While project reviews form part of the internal Danida monitoring process, it is now commonplace to involve external consultants in most reviews.<P>



Obviously, project implementation involves significant amounts of interaction between Danish authorities and government officials in the cooperation country. The specific division of labour and responsibilities is of course subject to considerable variations between countries and individual projects. In the case of very large and/or complex projects the Guidelines allows for establishing a specific 'monitoring and evaluation unit' as part of the project. Project management staff are generally required to prepare semi- annual 'progress reports', although the frequency may be higher, depending on individual circumstances and wether it is a well established or newly initiated project.

<P>

<B><I>3. Project completion</B></I> involves the 'handing-over' to the project-implementing organisation in the cooperation country, the project completion report (PCR), and evaluation studies that may be undertaken in order to extract experience applicable to the specific project and with regard to future development activities. PCRs are prepared by staff who have been involved in implementation and the information provided in the reports is forwarded to the Evaluation Unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for further analysis.<P>



During recent years Danida has worked with a rolling two-year evaluation programme, comprising 12-15 studies annually. The programme is categorised into the following six types of evaluations: <I>

 interim evaluations</I> are studies of ongoing projects with a major focus on project management and implementation. <I>

 Ex-post project evaluations</I> aim at assessing what lasting impact a particular project has had or is likely to have, while <I>

 evaluations of aid forms</I> analyse one specific aid modality (e.g. support for NGOs or balance of payment support), usually by looking at several projects or programmes in different countries. <I>

 Sector evaluations</I> look into all or most Danida supported projects within a given sector (e.g. agriculture or electrification) in one or several recipient countries, while <I>

 thematic evaluations</I> address Danida experiences with regard to aspects such as women, technology or human rights. Finally, <I>

 country programme evaluations</I> study the entire Danida programme in one of the 20 programme countries, including the various instruments in country programming (Danida 1994a:1-3). <A NAME="29"></A><A HREF="#e29">(29.)</A><P>



The evaluation guidelines emphasise the following three categories of users of evaluation findings: project staff &amp; recipient authorities, Danida, and others, including Danish media. Evaluation studies are seen as a means to ensure accountability for the use of aid funds, and therefore reports are generally made available to the general public, including comments from Danida on key evaluation findings. Key findings from the evaluation programme are presented on an annual basis to the Danida board together with an updated two-year programme, while a brief overview of completed evaluations is included in the Danida Annual Reports. <A NAME="30"></A><A HREF="#e30">(30.)</A><P>



Generally, it appears that evaluation studies and other feed back mechanisms in project management are not key concerns for the aid policy community despite the fact that such reports seek to document the extent to which the overall aid policy objectives are actually achieved. Rather the main emphasis remains on influencing the policy formulation parts of Danish aid administration, i.e. the input side. Thus, project management issues has remained primarily the domain of the Danida administration. Internally in Danida it has also been argued that experiences highlighted in evaluation reports are often not sufficiently utilised by staff in the operational departments (Bruszt, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990:22).

<P>

<B><A NAME="5"></A>5. Policy-Based Lending</B><A NAME="31"></A> <A HREF="#e31">(31.)</A>

<P>



For many years the concept of 'neutrality' was a fundamental element in Danish aid relations. During the years of 'North-South dialogue' in the UN system on a new economic world order, Denmark perceived herself as a bridge builder between radical third world demands and the conservative Northern 'camp'. Bilateral aid was only little affected by these debates, though, as these issues were almost solely raised in relation to multilateral organisations. Furthermore, Danish aid remained based on project interventions without much concern for the national and sector policy framework for project implementation. The World Bank's move to policy-based lending in the context of structural adjustment programmes in 1980 and onwards was initially viewed with some scepticism, but there are no reports of Danish initiatives in this field until the latter part of the decade. <A NAME="32"></A><A HREF="#e32">(32.)</A>However, during the last ten years conditionality issues and broader questions of policy reforms have been raised to an increasing extent.<P>



There are three major reasons for this development. First, like it has been the case for other donors the World Bank has become an increasingly important international determinant of Danish aid policies. This is narrowly linked to the growing importance of the Bank in development cooperation, particularly the poor African countries to whom Denmark has traditionally given priority in its development cooperation (Mosley et al. 1991:3-61). Secondly, the move since 1987/88 towards more strategic country programming has implied more concern with general policy issues in recipient countries and with regard to seeing Danida assistance in relation to other donors. Finally, during the 1980s the seriousness of the African crisis had an increasing impact on Danish bilateral project implementation - a fact that served to pave the way for a realisation that economic policy reforms were required. One should note, though, that until very recently (app. 1992/93) general debates on policy based lending and its impact on Danish bilateral aid has only to a limited extent been raised by the Danish aid policy community. <P>



Changing Danish positions in this field in the mid-1980s was partly provoked by developments in Tanzania, the main recipient of Danish aid during many years. In the first half of the decade Denmark together with other like-minded countries had supported work undertaken by a team of foreign and local experts to 'break the ice' between Tanzania and the Bretton Woods institutions. However, the continuing economic depression and a deteriorating foreign exchange position finally prompted the Tanzanian government to adopt an IMF/WB supported adjustment programme. Experiences from this process seem influential in making Danida subsequently support the World Bank's efforts in this field. Thus, the 1988 Danida Plan of Action appeared as the first major policy document emphasising the need for economic liberalisation and structural reforms in Africa (Danida 1994b:67).

<P>

<B><A NAME="5.1"></A>5.1 Danish efforts to influence World Bank policies</B><P>



However, the relationship between the Danish aid administration and the World Bank is not only a question of the Bank influencing Danish policies. From 1986 initiatives were taken in the World Bank by the Nordic constituency requesting the World Bank to address the social impact of adjustment programmes (Bodelsen 1989). <A NAME="33"></A><A HREF="#e33">(33.)</A> These concerns were voiced in parallel to analyses emerging from UNICEF studies aimed at promoting the 'adjustment with a human face' approach. Thus, a thorough assessment of Denmark's particular influence on the World Bank's adjustment policies is hampered by the fact that Denmark and the other Nordic countries have not been alone in their criticism. UNICEF and others have argued along the same lines. On the other hand the emphasis on seeking alliances among other donors and multilateral institutions has given Denmark more influence on the Bank's objectives and policy than the modest Danish financial contributions to the World Bank Group could otherwise provide (Bodelsen 1989:142).<P>



Danish aid has occasionally been employed in co-financing operations with the World Bank but in a rather ad hoc fashion where it is hard to discern any deliberate Danida policy to employ aid funds to influence World Bank policies and conditionality (Danida 1993c). <A NAME="34"></A><A HREF="#e34">(34.)</A>Such financing has primarily been extended in support of specific projects and only rarely as cofinancing in the form of balance of payments support for World Bank structural adjustment programmes. In the period 1987-93 70% of the balance of payments support was allocated through 'commodity import support' programmes, while only 4% were spent of co-financing of World Bank SAP-credits, and 3% spent on debt relief. Furthermore, in the same period Danish balance of payment support was equivalent to app. 7% of the bilateral aid budget, a smaller share than for most other like-minded countries.<A NAME="35"></A> <A HREF="#e35">(35.)</A> Thus, while Danida acknowledges that cofinancing or parallel financing of World Bank adjustment operations can be viewed as an 'admission ticket' to getting a position in the policy dialogue on macro-economic issues, this option has not been used very often (Danida 1994b:8,70).<P>



Contrary to policy initiatives at central levels in the World Bank, it seems hard to identify deliberate Danish positions on adjustment in the policy dialogue at recipient country level before the early 1990s. Furthermore, it appears that Danish attempts to influence the course of adjustment have then primarily taken place during the implementation rather than the appraisal and design phases, although options exist for such initiatives. Meetings of the respective Consultative Groups have often formed an occasion to raise adjustment related issues (Danida 1994b:67ff).

<P>

<B><A NAME="5.2"></A>5.2 Current Danish policies on policy-based lending</B><P>



Currently, however, Danish aid policies are increasingly concerned with adjustment policies and the course and content of the policy dialogue between donors and recipient, as exemplified in the recent aid strategy where such issues take up the major part of the section devoted to stating Danish policies with regard to international financial institutions. Major emphasis is placed on the social aspects and impact of adjustment and on increasing local capacity and on ensuring ownership during programme design and implementation (Danida 1994d:44ff; Nielson 1995). In terms of Danish financial support in connection with structural adjustment a gradual change is foreseen. In the future, less resources will be made available for direct balance of payment support. Higher priority will be given to debt relief and more resources will be made available for budget support in connection with Danish support for recipient countries' sector programmes. It is expected, though, that the share of balance of payments in total bilateral aid may remain at the comparatively speaking low levels highlighted above.<P>



Although the World Bank's Special Programme of Assistance for Africa (SPA) has been operating since 1987, it is only since 1987 that is has received substantial attention in Danish aid policy and administration. A high level SPA working group has been set up within Danida as well as a SPA task force with the objective to involve Danida more in the cooperation with other donors on aid to Africa. Danida is engaged in several of the working groups Danida 1994b:73).<P>



An increased and more explicit Danish profile in the policy dialogue between donors and recipients as stated in the new aid strategy may carry with it a number of dynamics with rather different potentials. Thus, there may be several opportunities as well as weaknesses in the current Danida approach to policy dialogue, while the current external environment among donors and recipients may imply both new opportunities and threats to the succesfull achievement of Danida objectives. This is highlighted in a recent Danida evaluation report, from which the table below is reproduced.<P>

<P>

The more explicit Danida policy stance in this field appears to be partly the result of external pressure from parts of the aid policy community, primarily the NGOs, partly effected by an increasing consciousness within the Danish aid administration to improve bilateral aid effectiveness by also taking up issues that are not confined to project-based interventions. Adding to the issues raised in the table one could further argue that a more marked Danish profile vis-&agrave;-vis the World Bank also carries the risk that this part of Danida policies will be further politicised. In turn this may serve to narrow the freedom of manoeuvre previously enjoyed by Danida staff and management in relation to the international financial institutions.



<A NAME="6"><h3><hr>6. Relations with the European Union</h3></a>



Danish contributions to development cooperation within the European Union account for almost 15 % of Denmark's multilateral development assistance or about 7 % of Denmark's total aid budget. This corresponds to 2,1% of the total EDF.<P>



After a cautious start in 1973, Denmark has adopted a more active approach in relation to the EC aid policy especially since the latter part of the 1980s. The relatively clear change in attitude to the Community aid policy was presumably inspired by the new dynamism in the EC cooperation appearing after 1986. It is, however, hardly not enough to explain the conspicuously active Danish contribution to the drafting of the Maastricht Treaty, which took effect in 1993.<P>



In this process, Denmark played an active role in formulating the policies concerning aid and trade. This new and active Danish policy is only understandable if it is seen as part of a broader Danish negotiating strategy prior to the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. It can be argued that aid policy, in particular, represented a &quot;soft&quot; area, where Denmark could have both an interest in and especially an opportunity to give high profile to the Danish views. The possible influence could thus be used as an argument or a &quot;proof&quot; of Denmark's ability to win influence in the EU under a new and closer European co-operation regime.<P>



From a Danish point of view, the currently most important task within the EU development co-operation is to further elaborate the development policy framework set out by the Maastricht treaty. In official Danish aid circles there is a widespread feeling that the content of the articles 130 U - Y in the Maastricht treaty is a proof of the influence in the EU as the principles are more or less identical with Danish bilateral aid goals. Danish proponents refer especially to the wording of article 130 U, according to which Community policy in the sphere of development cooperation is complementary to the policies pursued by the member states. It is especially important that the Article points out that Community policy must promote <I>

 the sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them</I>. In addition, Community policy must support <I>

 the campaign against poverty in developing countries</I>. Viewed from Denmark, these formulations are bringing Community development policy in line with the fundamental poverty orientation of Danish bilateral assistance. That the poverty orientation has now been enshrined in the treaty is considered a reflection of Danish influence.<P>



The concern for poverty implies that Denmark works to maintain Africa in focus in European development policy. Priority is also given to increase the participation of poor countries in the international trade co-operation. The Danish Government thus considers the EU to possess a major comparative advantage in the sense that it is possible to combine a wide geographical coverage with an integrated approach to areas of development policy such as trade, economic cooperation and aid (Danida 1993a:77).<P>



During the negotiations of the mid-term revision of the Lom&eacute; IV Convention, Denmark particularly sought to strengthen the agreement in three key fields: 1) increased demands for respect for human rights, democracy and good governance, 2) improvements in the administrative procedure for the Union's development assistance, and 3) greater emphasis on qualitative criteria in connection with payment of funds under individual country programmes.<P>



Generally, Danish officials argue that it is possible to exert a far greater influence than can be expected from its share of 2,1 per cent of the EDF and from the 1,8 percent Danish share of the general budget.<A NAME="36"></A> <A HREF="#e36">(36.)</A>Among the reasons for these perceptions are undoubtly the large and growing aid volumes during recent years as well as good international reputation of being both poverty oriented and effective. Having argued that Denmark has been quite successful in promoting its goals into the wording of the EU development policy, it can in no way be seen as a guarantee that deeds live up to the words, however. Generally, it seems that Danish moves towards a more activist position in multilateral development cooperation has been most pronounced in relation to the United Nations system, which has been the focus of various studies and reform proposals. No such specific initiatives have been launched so far with regard to EU where the ordinary meetings in the Council of Ministers remain the primary focus for Danish policy-making.<P>



Official Danish aid positions vis-&agrave;-vis the EU have traditionally argued for the Commission to be the 13th donor rather than a supra-national actor with a mandate to coordinate and influence the individual aid programmes of the 12 member states. Furthermore, it has been emphasised that there is still scope for improvement in the performance of the Commission's own programmes, and that one should concentrate efforts in these fields rather than moving to increased policy and operational coordination at headquarters and field levels. It is often stated that the Commission seriously lacks capacity in Brussels as well as at the delegations to cope with expanding mandates related to coordination of the member states. Thus, Danida emphasises the key roles of the World Bank and (to a lesser extent) the UNDP in aid coordination, and it is argued that the EU should not duplicate this work. <P>



At the field level the Commission's portfolio is regarded as that of any other multilateral institution, and Danish officials usually do not engage in a lot of interaction with EU officials at the level of recipient country capitals. On the other hand increasing weight appears to be given to participating in fortnightly or monthly meetings, organised by the local delegation to exchange views on the overall political (i.e. not specifically aid related) development in a given country.<P>



The Danish aid policy community has generally payed less attention to EU aid compared to the two other major 'pillars' in Danish multilateral aid: the UN system and international financial institutions. Partly this is a reflection of relatively little knowledge on EU aid in the public and among aid professionals outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. More importantly, it must be seen in the light of general Danish debates on European cooperation and integration - a discussion that often tended to focus on the virtues of EC/EU membership as such rather than debating the specific objectives and contents of individual EU programmes. More recent Danish debates on EU aid has tended to focus on more systemic policy issues (the level of Lome IV funding, coherence between trade and aid policies of the EU etc.) rather than more specific issues related to the performance of EU aid at the country and project level.



<B><A NAME="7"></A>7. Organisational Structure for Planning, Implementation</B>



<P>



Since the start of Danish aid programme in 1962 (with an initial staff of 20) and until 1991 the aid administration has been handled by separate units within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Still, prior to 1986 aid administration was subordinate to other departments in the Ministry, thus e.g. limiting Danida's direct access to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. <A NAME="37"></A><A HREF="#e37">(37.)</A>Proposals to place Danida outside the framework of the ministry (as an independent directorate or as a new ministry) had previously been rejected on the grounds that aid policy had very close relations to general foreign policy and to foreign trade policy. The status of Danida within the ministry had been debated, though, a few times during the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s but without major changes occurring (cf. Administrationsdepartementet 1986e). In 1982 the Government appointed Commission to review Danish aid policies had been rejected by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in looking into aid administration issues as part of its work (Udvalget vedr. dansk bistandspolitik 1982:174f).<P>



However, by 1986 a major management review of Danida led to substantial changes in the organisational set-up for Danish aid administration, as a series of recommendations were implemented from late 1986 and onwards (Administrationsdepartementet 1986). The main thrust of the review report is presented here since it is an important precondition for assessing the more recent organisational changes with regard to Danida's position within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<P>



The review led to strategic planning being employed as a key management instrument (resulting i.a. in the 1988 Danida Plan of Action), and it was emphasised that more attention should be paid to aid <I>operational</I> purposes in contrast to the previous situation where aid <I>policy</I> issues had dominated. The review also paved the way for an integration of the different aid modalities (tied aid, project aid and technical assistance) all to be administered by regional divisions and field missions in stead of functional divisions in the ministry. Rather than 'diplomats' rotating between different ministerial positions (most of them not aid related) Danida would in the future base itself on a core staff of permanently employed 'aid administrators' in the regional departments plus an expanded number of sector and technical professionals to serve in support functions during project preparation and execution.<A NAME="38"></A> <A HREF="#e38">(38.)</A><P>



The review further emphasised the need to reduce the then high staff turn over caused by ministerial rotation policies, as it was argued that Danida files and not staff members were the sole carriers of corporate memory. It was suggested that individual positions should be occupied by the same staff members for at least 3 years (Administrationsdepartementet 1986c:18; ibid. 1986d:4). Finally, the review made Danida initiate a decentralisation process whereby decision-making competence would be transferred away from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs headquarters in Copenhagen to Danida field missions in developing countries and further on to staff at the individual, Danida supported projects. <A NAME="39"></A><A HREF="#e39">(39.)</A><P>



The basic administrative framework for these and other changes was to be a new separate department within the Ministry, Danida, with its own permanent secretary and direct access to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Chart 1 presents the administrative structure of Danida in the period 1986-91.<P>



In 1990 a review of experiences with the reformed Danida structure pointed at a number of achievements and problems related to the administrative setup (Bruszt, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990). First, it was emphasised that an integration of the different aid modalities in bilateral aid had been successful, and that important achievements had been made with regard to strengthening Danida's policy and sector professional capacity. The review pointed out, however, that this had happened partly at the cost of weakening the core element in the new structure, the regional departments. Lack of resources and reduced decision-making competence had made the regional departments loose out to the newly established technical departments. The resulting structure had become a highly complex matrix organisation with uncertain lines of command.<P>



Furthermore, Danida management had not given higher priority to aid operational issues (as opposed to policy advice for the Minister of Foreign Affairs) such as it had been suggested in the 1985/86 management review. Finally, an end to rapid staff rotations between different positions had not been achieved, although this had also been a key issue in the management review. Periods of service had increased somewhat, particularly for heads of departments, but was generally deemed much too low, especially for personnel from the general foreign service who came out with an average of 1,3 year on a positing (Brustz, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990:43f).

<P>

<B><A NAME= "7.1"></A>7.1 The 1991 Danida reorganisation</B><P>



In 1989 the Government set up the Foreign Service Commission to define centrals tasks for the foreign service in the years ahead and to recommend changes in the organisation of the entire foreign service (Udenrigskommissionen 1990). Following the recommendations of the Commission in 1990, a new organisational structure was implemented in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1991 to create a unified foreign service with two administrative groups organised on the basis of geography rather than the previous three functionally divided departments. <A NAME="40"></A><A HREF="#e40">(40.)</A> One group (called North) covers the industrialized countries plus the former Communist countries in the East and another group (called South) covers all the developing countries. <A NAME="41"></A><A HREF="#e41">(41.)</A>Each of the two groups is headed by a state secretary. In addition to the geographical modes of organisation, two other main changes was included in the new structure: a unified foreign service where staff members move between positions throughout the organisation rather than being confined e.g. to Danida; and a system of joint representations in the foreign service abroad. Thus, individual civil servants may serve and seek promotion in each of the two groups. However, in the South Group the Technical Advisory Service has been taken over from the previous administrative structure, and the various technical and sector specialists are not part of the foreign service as such.<P>



The Foreign Service Commission reconfirmed and reinforced the 1986 decisions to decentralise major decision-making competence to embassies abroad. Furthermore, the previous system with separate Danida field missions and embassies was changed, so that embassies would also be in charge of the Danish aid programme. Concerning decentralization and simplification, this was mainly aimed at the embassies, representations and missions abroad. The basic idea was to establish units abroad of such a size that they would be self-sustaining and where the head of the mission had both a considerable room for disposing over his own yearly appropriations and a possibility to act within certain broadly defined policy guidelines.

<P>

<B>Organisation chart 2: The Danish Aid Administration since 1991</B><P>





<P>



The unique feature of the 1991 reorganisation is that each of the two groups are responsible for all aspects of Denmark's bilateral relations with a given country i.e. the political, economic, developmental and - to a certain extent - the commercial. However, should be careful not to over-interpret the new structure as a radical departure from the past, since the setup still includes departments within each of the two main groups that derive their rationale from a functional division of labour rather than mere geography (Christensen 1992:94). The implication of the new structure is also that since 1991, 'Danida' is no longer synonymous with an administrative entity. In formal terms the 'label' is currently to be used only as the joint identification for Danish aid activities. However, due to the dominance of the aid programme within the South Group portfolio (Brustz, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990:71), 'Danida' is often used synonymously with the South Group. Furthermore, in reality the majority of the currently 19 embassies related to the South Group are based in Danida programmes countries and thus have a major emphasis on aid administration.

<P>



<B><A NAME="7.2"></A>7.2 Autonomy of overseas offices: delegation of powers</B>

<P>



As mentioned previously, increasing decentralisation has been included among Danida administrative objectives since the mid-1980s. <A NAME="43"></A><A HREF="#e43">(43.)</A>The precondition for effective decentralisation was perceived to be the formulation of a more strategic planning framework to guide the individual aid operations. Prior to the 1991 reorganisation main emphasis had been on strategic planning while a more thorough decentralisation of aid operations still remained (Brustz, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990:1). However, administration of technical assistance generally rests with the embassies, and in some in some countries procurement have been contracted to private companies.<P>



To gain momentum in the further process decentralisation has been suggested as a means to overcome the structural tendency for Danida management to focus primarily on policy advice to the Minister rather than involving themselves with aid operational and implementation issues. Thus, rather than insisting that management at headquarters should devote more attention to such issues, it would be a preferable option to decentralise responsibility for such tasks away from the top Danida management in Copenhagen to regional departments and further on to embassies in the programme countries (Bruszt, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990:39, 62).<P>



Local embassies play a key role in project identification and project monitoring together with government authorities. Furthermore, it is expected that embassy staff conduct a regular dialogue with local authorities on sector policy issues as well general development issues. Still, with regard to appraisal, review, evaluations and annual negotiations participation from headquarters are more pronounced: primarily with regard to the regional departments and TSA. In order to utilize the resources available in the most cost-effective manner and enhance the quality of Danish development aid, Danida is currently examining the possibilities of further decentralisation by transferring additional responsibility and decision making competence from the headquarters to the embassies.<P>



Since 1988 Danish embassies have been authorised to approve small projects and enter into contracts with e.g. local private companies, local NGOs etc. in amounts of up to DKK 1 m (the Local Grant Authority, LGA). This amount was raised to DKK 3 m. in 1990. The individual embassies have applied the LGA in very different manners with a general tendency for embassies with a limited project portfolio to spend large amounts (as much as 20% of the total budget framework) while embassies in countries with a long standing Danida presence and a larger project portfolio to spend rather small amounts. Danida policy is currently to limit LGA spending to a maximum of 10% of total financing planned within the area covered by the embassy. <P>



Within the aid administration experiences with this aid modality are generally considered to be very positive. It provides for more flexibility, the possibility to test new partners on a limited scale before entering into major engagement, and the possibility to use the Local Grant Authority to support various national and local NGO initiatives is sometimes felt to be very useful in enhancing the Danish 'profile'. Problems have related to lack of staff at the embassies to assess new applications and to ensure satisfactorily accountability with recipients. Furthermore, new projects are often initiated according to the personal priorities of individual project officers at the embassies and as staff turn over is high this leads to many new activities being started and to neglects in project follow up. Finally, coordination problems have been a recurrent feature with regard to division of labour and information procedures between the embassies, the regional departments, the Danida policy department and the Finance department (Danida 1994e).

<P>

<B><A NAME="7.3"></A>7.3 Experiences with the new administrative structure</B>

<P>



Experiences with the new 'South Group' structure are mixed. Some contend that aid professionalism is lost due to pressures from objectives emanating from the traditional diplomatic service. Furthermore, it is argued that swift rotations to ensure the training of 'generalists' for the foreign service take place at the expense of much needed continuity at both headquarters and field levels. The direct administrative linking of general foreign policy motives with aid implementation may imply less attention to complex aid professional issues. On the other hand it is also argued that a more holistic approach has proven to be beneficial, i.a. since other Danish Foreign Policy objectives that might serve to undercut aid objectives are often absent in most of the low-income countries where Denmark is operationally involved. Furthermore, improved coordination between different policy areas may lead to enhanced policy coherence. Finally, some assert that the 'main streaming' of development aid administration implicit in the new structure is actually an advantage to the sidelining that could take place in a set-up that allowed aid to be isolated from general foreign policy making.<P>



The appointment since 1993 of a Government Minister for Development Cooperation is probably as important as any reorganisation for the standing of the Danish aid administration in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the Government as such. This is the first time since the late 1970s that a government minister has been appointed, as the general government position otherwise has been to include development cooperation within the portfolio of the Foreign Minister. On the one hand this has served to reduce the standing of aid in the general government hierarchy: before 1993 aid policy 'benefitted' from the traditional 'number two position' of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government, now development cooperation ranks much lower. On the other hand, a politically appointed minister tends to imply a higher profile in public and parliamentary debates on aid, than has been the case previously. Probably more important is the fact that ministerial management is now guided much closer in aid policy formulation and administration than previously.<P>



Before leaving the reorganisation, it may be relevant to reflect on what kind of interests have been involved in the recent changes. Unlike other Danish ministries the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can generally said to rely less on tight relations to and interaction with major interest organisations in the particular sector. However, both with regard to export promotion &amp; foreign trade and concerning aid administration the ministry is involved in considerable interaction with external organisations (Christensen 1992:99). With regard to Danida it is important to note, though, that while the organisation of Danish aid administration has been the subject for debates (e.g. in the Council for International Development Cooperation), major actors have generally abstained from involving themselves directly in debates on the virtues of reorganising aid administration. <A NAME="44"></A><A HREF="#e44">(44.)</A>Thus, it is assumed that internal interests and internal pressure groups can have considerable influence on the arrangement of the organisation (Christensen 1992:100).<P>



It can be argued that there was a merging of the interests of the Minister at that time (who in his portfolio had both foreign affairs and aid) and top management in the Ministry. In addition to a complex management structure in general, the Danida management felt to an increasing extent that the 1986 reorganisation was not working according to the intentions. The aid administration had ended in having a centralized structure where the technical and sector staff had gained a unintentional concentration of decision making power (cf. Brustz, Hedberg &amp; Wallroth 1990; Christensen 1992:102). At the same time, there was a majority in Parliament in favour of increasing aid allocations to reach 1% of GDP by 1992. <P>



However, following three decades of rapid growth with headquarter staff more than doubling, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself was subject to the very strict appropriation limitations as were other ministries at that time. <A NAME="45"></A><A HREF="#e45">(45.)</A> On the contrary aid budgets continued to grow, and already by 1990 the aid budget was six times the size of the budget for the rest of the Foreign Service (Udenrigskommissionen 1990: vol. I, 81).This necessarily lead to considerable tensions between the different departments of the Ministry. Also there were often critique of the concrete projects financed by Danida as well as critique of Danida itself. All these circumstances produced a recognition of the need to tighten the whole organisation in order to secure control of concrete arrangements and also to carry out a decentralization which changed the guidance system and the administrative procedures in a direction to make the Ministry and the Minister himself less vulnerable to critique from the outside, i.e. from the press, the public and from the Parliament. One expected consequence of the reorganisation was that it would now be easier to give clear political signals of where the aid policy was heading.<P>



It seems that most of the involved persons and groups were in favour of the reorganisation when it was proposed. The Minister and ministerial management quite obviously supported a reorganisation which would strengthen management and which opened for a better coordination of the whole field of foreign affairs. <A NAME="46"></A><A HREF="#e46">(46.)</A> Generally, it is the prerogative of Danish Governments to organise the civil service according to their priorities, and Parliament and the general public often abstain from involving themselves in such debates (Christensen 1992:102). Finally, the aid policy community was satisfied as long as the new structure provided them with sufficient entry points to policy decisions and access to aid funds.

<P>

<B><A NAME="8"></A>8. Accountability and the Role of the Aid Policy Community</B>

<P>

Questions of accountability and the involvement of actors external to Government and Parliament have been of central importance since the initial phases of the Danish aid programme. Thus, popular organisations were highly influential in shaping the Danish aid programme during the first half of the 1960s. Furthermore, during the following years it became a deliberate Government policy to use aid funds for development education programmes implemented by Danish NGOs. Contrary to perceiving the Danish aid programme as part and parcel of traditional foreign policy with its emphasis on bureaucratic and diplomatic distance from broader public and political debate, it was considered vital to involve broader sections of the Danish society. Accordingly, the participation of different Danish organisations would serve to avoid e.g. tax payer criticism of government funds being squandered on useless purposes (J&oslash;rgensen 1977).<P>



It was in line with these considerations that the first Parliament Act on Development Cooperation (1962) instituted the Board for International Development Cooperation and the Council for International Development Cooperation. Both the Board and the Council have been maintained in subsequent aid legislation. The role of the Board is to advice the Minister of Foreign Affairs (or the Minister for Development Cooperation), who also appoints the nine members, including the Chairman. Although the Act does not provide further details, it seems firmly established that at least six of the nine members represent various organisations, among them the Danish Trade Unions Congress, Danish Industry, and the Agricultural Council, while two NGOs have served as observers in addition to the full members. <A HREF="#e47">(47.)</A><P>



The Board considers all project applications above DKK 5 m. whereafter they are submitted to the Minister. Projects with a budget above DKK 20 m. are presented to the Parliament Finance Committee. Historically, the Board has given priority to project applications rather than to giving the Minister policy advice on broad aid related issues, a field where ministerial staff has dominated. <A NAME="48"></A><A HREF="#e48">(48.)</A> During recent years debates on country strategies and broader policy issues have gained increasing importance. Still, neither in relation the 1988 Danida Action Plan nor with regard to the 1994 development policy strategy has the Board played any key role (cf. Martinussen 1989:247). Furthermore, the Board does not appear to have been involved in the process of selecting programme countries for Danish bilateral aid. The Board's annual report on its operations (usually app. 10 pages) is included in Danida's Annual Report.<P>



Still, considerable <I>de facto</I> decision-making power is vested in the Board, whereas the Council primarily serves as a broad forum for debates with its app. 75 members representing an array of Danish organisations and aid interested individuals. The Council convenes at ordinary meetings twice a year to debate the rolling five year plan and the Danida annual report respectively. In addition the Council meets for thematic sessions 2-4 times annually. While there does not appear to be any link between Board agendas and parliamentary aid debates, one can occasionally observe a connection between Council debates and subsequent discussions in Parliament.<P>



It is obvious that both the Board and the Council serve importants function with regard to accountability. It is noteworthy, however, that in the eyes of the public and within Danida itself the Board may be perceived as securing legitimacy rather than accountability since almost no information on the deliberations of the Board are generally available apart from the brief annual reports. On the contrary the Council promotes debate and exchange of information and thus provides interested parties, including the NGOs, the media and parliamentarians with a possibility to hold Danida accountable. Still, it is notable, though, that the main actors in the Council are generally drawn from the core of the established aid policy community rather than other organisations and environments without the same amount of immediate day to day involvement with aid policy and management issues.<P>

<A NAME="8.1"></A>8.1 The role of Parliament and the political parties</B><P>



According to article 2 in the act on Denmark's International Development Cooperation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (or recently) the Minister for Development Cooperation presents to Parliament a plan for Danish ODA appropriations for the coming five year period, the rolling five year plan. However, while the plan is debated in the Council Parliament does not have tradition for debates on the paper, neither in full sessions nor in the Foreign Committee. Furthermore, the Budget is in general subject to considerable debate, but proposals and decisions on aid appropriations are seldom receiving much attention.<P>



When in opposition the parties to the right usually include reductions in the aid budgets in their proposed amendments, but generally these are not in the focus during subsequent parliamentary debates on the size and composition of public expenditures. Furthermore, it is notable that since the then liberal government was defeated in the 1985 vote on increasing the Danish aid budget to 1% of GDP, it did not include aid reductions in its budget readings during the rest of its period in office. Thus, while not all parties will support the 1% objective if questioned specifically, in general it has become 'a fact of life'. With regard to aid budget allocations, the only recurring issue seems to be the question of the distribution between bilateral and multilateral assistance. The policy to divide aid approximately equal between the two main channels has consistently been supported by a government majority since the early 1970s despite opposition from the two main parties on the right.<P>



Individual aid allocations above DKK 20 m. are sent to the Finance Committee for approval, but it is uncommon for the committee to debate these as the recommendation from the Board is generally considered to guarantee that the specific appropriation falls within Danish aid objectives. The Foreign Committee receives a copy of the application documents for information but in general these are not subject to further discussions. However, both the Danida Action Plan (1988) and the recent strategy for Danish development policy (1994) have been debated in the Committee subsequent to their presentation and general approval by parliament. Thus, the Committee in a 1989 report laid down the still valid criteria for the choice of programme countries.<P>



In its 1994 report on the strategy for development policy the Committee reiterated its interest in being involved in debates on country strategies and it further requested the Minister for Development Cooperation to prepare to Parliament an account of how the general poverty alleviation objective is being operationalised in Danish aid. In this connection the Committee has signalled an interest to monitor somewhat more closely than has previously been the case the implementation of Danish aid policy. The modalities have not yet been fully worked out, and the extent to which Parliament considers aid a priority issue is still an open question. <P>



The public auditors do include aid projects, bilateral as well as multilateral, in their regular investigations and reporting to Parliament. Critical issues in these reports are often raised in public and political debates. However, responses from particularly Danida and occasionally also the aid policy community tend to emphasize the inherent difficulty in conforming to strict auditing criteria developed in a specific Danish context during the implementation of complex aid interventions.<P>



A final issue in debating accountability of aid policy to Parliament relates to the question of seeing the Government's aid programmes as part and parcel of the general Danish foreign policy. Thus, like other Western democracies the Danish constitution emphasises foreign policy as a Government prerogative where the legislature will only to a limited extent be involved. Against this it can be argued that Government together with the major political parties historically have underlined the importance of popular participation in aid debates, cf. the role of the Board and the Council.<A NAME="49"></A> <A HREF="#e49">(49.)</A> To a certain extent one can argue that accountability to Parliament has been squeezed between these two basic notions of Danish aid policy: as a government prerogative and as a policy area that requires broad popular backing.<P>



Studies suggest that the political parties face a dilemma, if and when foreign aid policy is politicised. On the one hand, Danish development aid has been generally supported by the population ever since the 1960s (Svendsen, 1989:94). Polls have even shown a steadily rising level of support up to the most recent survey where 75 per cent of the respondents were in favour of granting development aid at the precent level, i.e. 1% of GDP (Berlingske Tidende, February 13, 1995). Another poll confirms the picture and finds that 85% of respondents consider aid conditionality fully acceptable. Also, it is shown that 75% think that aid should only be given to democratic countries (Jyllands Posten, March 12 1995).<P>



On the other hand, there are no signs that the votes of the electorate are affected to any appreciable extent by the parties' development policies (Holm 1982:110-115; Svendsen 1989:93). It is relatively cost-free for politicians to have a high profile in this policy area. Still, it seems that both the political parties, the wider aid policy community and successive governments have stressed the importance of a consensus based approach to Danish aid in order not to alienate public support by constantly criticising and challenging existing policies and programmes. Thus, it is probably correct that Danish aid is characterized by having <I>'political peace as its political goal'</I> (Boel 1986).<P>



The dilemma of the parties touches upon a paradox at the heart of the Danish political system. On the one hand, there is a multitude of political parties and on the other hand, Danish political culture tend to emphasise compromise and consensus in decision-making. Parly this apoproach is based on the ambition that at least the broader and more important issue areas will not be too strongly affected by the recurring changes in party alliances after the next round of elections for Parliament. Thus major efforts are made to ensure that substantial political initiatives, particularly in foreign policy, are supported by the largest possible majority of political parties, be they in government or in opposition.

<P>

<B><A NAME="8.2"></A>8.2 The NGOs and the business interests</B> <A NAME="50"></A><A HREF="#e50">(50.)</A><P>



While Parliament appears in a reactive position vis-&agrave;-vis Government and external actors with regard to aid policy, quite extensive public debates take place on aid and general development issues. Development policy has repeatedly been an arena for a variety of organisations and interest groups. While championing a general concern for development as the rationale for various interventions in public debate, there is no doubt that both several NGOs and business organisations have been motivated by getting access to or maintaining their share of government aid funds. <P>



There is a large number of voluntary organisations engaged in development and aid issues in Denmark, including both religious and secular organisations. In conformity with their objectives they undertake general campaigns as well as lobby efforts vis-&agrave;-vis Danida in order to seek influence on the shaping and implementation of aid policy. Their work is facilitated considerably by the fact that part of their information activities and general operations are financed by Danida. <P>



There is no doubt that the Danish NGO community has had considerable leverage on parts of Denmark's aid policy. NGOs have contributed to setting the agenda for the official Danish policy concerning the necessity of local popular involvement in the development process, women's special role and consideration for the environment etc. Recurrent features have been debates on the acclaimed negative effects of tied aid in the Danish aid programme and the need for a clearer poverty orientation. Possibly, NGOs have been most influential with regard to increasing aid resources. First with regard to committing Parliament to achieve the 1% target and secondly in maintaining the 50/50 distribution of aid between bilateral and multilateral uses. As a third feature one may pint to the decision to add another 0,5% of GDP to the already large Danish budgets for international assistance, the special budget line for environment and emergency assistance. Finally, NGO efforts have been decisive in down scaling the aid budget financing of receiving asylum seekers from developing countries.<P>



The choice of programme countries for Danish bilateral assistance is also a field where NGOs successfully have lobbied and campaigned for a focus on Africa and on low-income countries. Thus, in a number of instances NGOs have first influenced the formulation of broader policy objectives and subsequently held Danida and Parliament accountable.<P>



It is, however, also characteristic that Danish NGOs have been involved in both the current policy processes and the management of a growing part of Danish ODA. The strong growth that some organisations have experienced during recent years and the heavy demands that this have implied for management and implementation procedures have tended to reduce the focus on information and campaigning. The reliance on government funding and the demands for professionalisation of project management within NGO administrations are often seen as a gradual co-optation of these organisations, a tendency that easily leads to less critical policy positions towards official aid programmes. (J&oslash;rgensen, Larsen &amp; Udsholt 1993:17).<P>



In addition to the NGOs the business community is one of the most important participants in the Danish aid policy community. However, its interests are mostly tied to the magnitude of the orders and how the individual companies can maximize their earnings from Danish aid contracts It is evident that since the abandonment of the tied aid programme as such and its replacement by the more flexible procedures to ensure the return of 50% of bilateral aid to Danish contracts and services, one has witnessed considerable informal and hidden pressure on Danida management. This has been especially outspoken in relation to choice of sector focus and programme countries for Danish aid. While private companies may emphasise the need to keep Danida accountable with regard to return rates, business interests may generally prefer a softening of the other overall aid objectives. The termination of the 'fixed' tied aid programme in 1988 has clearly led to increasing quality in Danish aid. However, taken in isolation this particular aid modality in the past probably led to a higher degree of accountability as it was applied in an open fashion and not directly affecting the rest of the aid programme.<P>



Currently the 'flexible approach' in certain instances can reduce accountability mechanisms as this particular objective may not always be stated explicitly even though it has in reality been an important determinant for a particular policy outcome.



<B><A NAME="8.3"></A>8.3 Concluding remarks on the role of the aid policy community</B>

<P>



While the general concern to seek wide consensus in aid policy making has been an important determinant for Danish aid objectives, one may also need to consider the self-interests of the parties involved. The participants form a relatively closed 'policy community' where participants gain from being involved with the policy process and from moderating their explicit differences.<P>



It is also remarkable but not surprising that both accountability issues and the involvement of the aid policy community are most pronounced within the field of bilateral aid. As mentioned previously with EU and the World Bank as specific cases, there is generally less public attention to multilateral organisations, and the mechanisms for influencing policy making are both less known and less developed than what is the case for bilateral aid. This is not surprising since political processes in international organisations often do not lend themselves to public scrutiny (Engberg-Pedersen 1994:53).<P>



To a certain extent this may have a negative effect on the nature of the accountability systems which currently characterize the Danish aid administration. However, compared to other areas of foreign policy, Danish aid is certainly the policy field where demands for accountability are most clearly expressed and institutionalised.

<P>

<B><A NAME="9"></A>9. Conclusion</B><P>



The basic framework for Danish aid has remained fairly stable throughout the last 2-3 decades. Poverty orientation, returns to Danish business enterprises, an equal distribution between bilateral and multilateral aid channels, and a strong emphasis on popular involvement with aid issues are recurring features of Danish aid policy. Thus, while aid discussions are popping up in public debates from time to time it is striking how little the overall objectives have changed.<P>



Two inter-related factors have been decisive for this outcome. First, the large number of stakeholders demanding an influence on both general policy and specific aid allocations serves to hamper fundamental changes. Secondly, the explicit objective to seek the broadest possible public support for the aid programme has led to an incremental approach to policy making with a strong emphasis on consensus and broad compromises.<P>



Still, the current Danish system of aid administration has evolved as a result of a long-term and continuous process of balancing three different sets of demands and interests. They are strongly inter-related and may not necessarily always be mutually exclusive. The striking feature in this context is not the dominance of one over another but rather the fact that this balancing act in itself has become a fundamental condition for aid management and administration.<P>



The first issue relates to the very observable contrast between seeing aid policy as an integrated part of foreign policy and therefore a Government prerogative on the one hand and on the other hand the notion of aid policy as an issue area that requires particular and explicit forms of external participation. Thus, there is a marked difference between placing aid management in an organisation culture highly influenced by the diplomatic service and its emphasis on confidentiality on the one hand and on the other hand inviting Danish NGOs to manage substantial aid resources while also requesting them to comment on Government policy making.<P>



Secondly, one has experienced persistent attempts to enhance aid management capacity within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This has been an outcome of professional and technical ambitions among the staff. However, this tendency is contrasted with the emphasis on involving actors outside the ministry in management and implementation of the aid programme. In this regard the rationale appears to be partly the complexities inherent in aid administration and implementation. These issues require involvement of considerable amounts of specialised expertise which almost by definition cannot be fully available with the aid administration itself. Partly the participation of external actors are explained in virtue of the constant pressures to limit government civil service expenditures by contracting substantial amounts of work to private companies.<P>



A third and final feature concerns the balancing between seeing Danida's primary task as one of providing policy advice to the Minister and the Government as opposed to emphasising aid operational issues as being at the core of the Danida raison d'etre.<P>



There is probably not one single 'correct' and 'definitive' answer to the question of how the optimal balancing would look like. Demands on the aid administration vary considerably over time and with regard to the respective aid issue areas. Furthermore, obviously the result is also a product of the relative strength and capacity that various actors can mobilise and master, both within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in Government at large and in Parliament, and within the broader aid policy community.

<LI><A NAME="e1"></A>Contrary to several other European donors Danish governments have traditionally maintained a unified aid administration within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including both bilateral and multilateral development assistance, and including various 'tied aid' programmes. Recently, one has witnessed a growing number of other government bodies being involved in programmes to assist e.g. Eastern Europe or to address global environmental problems. However, this paper maintains a focus on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The paper has generally been structured in conformity with the design of a comparative research project on European aid administrations, initiated by Overseas Development Institute (UK) and European Centre for Development Policy and Management (Netherlands). <A HREF="#b1">[Back to Text]</A>

He further notes i.a. an unusually high degree of collaborative efforts with a large emphasis on universally international cooperation and with relatively small emphasis on defence and security concerns. (Martinussen 1989:249).<A HREF="#b2">[Back to Text]</A>

<LI><A NAME="e3"></A>Activities supported by this budget line fall within the juridistiction of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Environment & Energy. The specific division of responsibilities for environmental assistance has been the source of considerable inter-ministerial rivalry and tensions. Experiences with this new type of Danish aid is not debated in this paper.

Thus, in reality Danish aid figures to an increasing extent surpass the 1% of GDP target that remains the basic aid volume objective, since environmental assistance and expenditures for asylum seekers from developing countries are not included in the aid figures. It is, however, government policy not to consider these expenditure categories as ODA, contrary to current DAC rules.<A HREF="#b3">[Back to Text]</A>

<LI><A NAME="e4"></A>The first Act on development cooperation (1962) included no statement of objectives. Rather it was agreed that during build up of the aid programme, one should allow the relevant authorities to accumulate experiences and professional insights prior to a decision on overall guidelines and objectives.<A HREF="#b4">[Back to Text]</A>

<LI><A NAME="e5"></A>The liberal minority government managed to secure majority support for its economic policies while accepting several defeats with regard to parliamentarymotions on security policy (e.g. on NATO and European nuclear rearmament).<A HREF="#b5">[Back to Text]</A> 

<LI><A NAME="e6"></A>Interestingly, Parliament has not yet had a specific thematic debate on 'private sector development' similar to the ones on 'women', 'environment' etc., and one looks in vain for a specific Danida policy paper on this issue. Hence, the long-standing agreement to ensure a 50% rate of return to Danish companies from the bilateral aid appropriations is mainly reflected in strategies to involve Danish business in development cooperation, and not founded on a specific strategic vision of the role of the private sector in development.

<A HREF="#b6">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e7"></A>These are currently: Strategy for Danish Support to Indigenous People (Danida 1994f); Environmental Assessment for Sustainable Development (Danida 1994g); Human Rights and Democracy. Perspectives for development Cooperation (Danida 1993j); Women in Development. Danida`s WID Policy Towards the Year 2000 (Danida 1993K); Denmark`s Efforts in the Population Field. Strategy. (in Danish - Danida 1994g).

<A HREF="#b7">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e8"></A>Since 1991 the Danish aid administration has been an integrated part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contrary to the situation prevailing in 1986-91 when 'Danida' was one of three separate departments within the Ministry. Today, Danish development assistance is managed by the 'South Group' in the Ministry. Hence, in strictly formal terms the 'Danida' label is not currently applied to any specific administrative entity but rather to the activities taking place within the framework of Danish development cooperation policies. However, it seems to be common practice to equate Danida with the South Group. This approach is also pursued in this paper.

<A HREF="#b8">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e9"></A>The plan has recently been made available in an abridged English language version (Danida 1994j).

<A HREF="#b9">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e10"></A>The study notes that prior to 1986 strategic planning had not been employed as a management instrument in Danida. The study furthermore observes that policy formulation is in itself a partly unclear process which is a result of a relatively stable, long-term policy development and a range of more sudden adjustments which may appear as a result of more or less haphazardly arising `issues` (...). (Administrationsdepartementet 1986c:13). 

<A HREF="#10">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e11"></A>This was the case with regard to the proposals for future programme countries and the proposed 'flex-fund' that would be available to stimulate Danish business participation in various projects in developing countries. As a result of the subsequent public and parliamentary debate, the plan for the flex-fund was abandoned and several of the middle-income countries were not short-listed as programme countries. Still, the Plan of Action seemed to indicate that Danish commercial interests had now gained a significantly larger influence on Danish aid policy (cf. Martinussen 1988:252ff).

<A HREF="#10">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e12"></A>A summarised 20-page English version of the paper has been made available (Danida1994i). French and Spanish versions have also been prepared.

<A HREF="#12">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e13"></A>Furthermore, one might add that the document obviously served the purpose of formulating more explicitly the policy foundation for the new Minister for Development Cooperation that had been appointed with the formation of the new government in early 1993.

<A HREF="#13">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e14"></A>A major analysis of agency field effectiveness for 11 multilateral organisations completed in 1991 has been instrumental in enabling Danida to follow more systematically the relative performance of multilateral development agencies (Danida 1991).

<A HREF="#14">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e15"></A>Danida is now moving away from being a retailer with a speciality in `projects towards becoming a wholesaler in support of `sector programmes` (Therkildsen 1994:7).

<A HREF="#15">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e16"></A>Holm compares Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish positions in this respect and finds Danish policies to be the least responsive among the Scandinavians (Holm 1982:177). However, in a general DAC perspective Denmark has beenamong the group of donor countries emphasising dialogue rather than conditionality. Cf. Jørgensen (1977) for a historical account of the early phases of Danish development policy and its emphasis on `neutrality`.

<A HREF="#16">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e17"></A>Two of the key civil servants in the 1988 process from the then Danida policy office recurred in the 1993/94 process as respectively deputy permanent secretary (head of the South Group in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and as head of the small strategy unit created specifically to prepare the strategy.

<A HREF="#17">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e18"></A>It is currently agreed that the number of programme countries will normally not exceed 20, except in situations when programmes are beingphased in/out. In this case one may reach the maximum limit of 25.

<A HREF="#18">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e19"></A>Until 1989 Danish bilateral aid was equally divided between project assistance on grant terms and a tied aid programme providing government credits on concessional terms to finance deliveries from Danish companies. During the 1980s concessionality was gradually increased so that by 1988 all tied aid was provided on grant terms. In 1988 it was decided to terminate the tied aid programme as such. Since then, the objective to ensure 50% of bilateral aid to be spent on goods and services procured in Denmark has been measured ex post as the combined result of the total decisions on aid allocations in the bilateral programme. During the period 1989-93 the proportion of bilateral aid that 'returned' to Denmark declined from 68% to 51%. However, the more narrowly defined 'business related' returns on bilateral aid spending dropped from 56% to 27% within the same period. This figure is based on 'production criteria', i.e. only the share of a delivery actually produced in Denmark is included, whereas the other Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Germany all apply a criteria based on the location of the contractor. In 1994 Denmark changed to this approach.

<A HREF="#19">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e20"></A>The programme in Thailand - a country which was selected amidst much debate in 1989 - is currently being phased out since the country's GDP/capita now exceeds the Danish limit of 1,855 USD/capita. In this context it was decided to include Ethiopia among the programme countries in 1994 with a programme that would be gradually built up as Thailand was reduced. No resources were made available, though, for Ethiopia in the 1994 and 1995 budgets. By mid-1995 the Minister for Development Cooperation announced that the country would be taken off the list due to i.a.uncertainty with regard to conducting a regular policy dialogue with the Government. It was furthermore suggested that Malawi would be included in stead. Final approval by the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on this issue is still pending at the time of completing this paper (October 1995).

<A HREF="#20">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e21"></A>Danida figures in the Annual Report include technical assistance and support via Danish NGOs, while country figures in the rolling five-year plan are exclusive of these budget categories.

<A HREF="#21">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e22"></A>This figure includes expenditures for bilateral advisors in addition to the budget figures for the 20 programme countries reported in table 3. Most advisors are stationed in the 20 programme countries. The existing official budget presentations separate project aid from technical assistance. On the contrary Danida annual reports include all Danish aid (including NGOs, TA etc.) in the figures for actual country programme allocations.

<A HREF="#22">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e23"></A>It is, however, noteworthy that when in 1988 Danida approached 22 major Danish companies to learn about their views on country concentration, the result was a substantially more differentiated and more widespread obligingness towards the DANIDA-administration request for geographic concentration than the traditional positions of the main interest organisation 'Danish Industry', who favoured a more widely dispersed aid programme (Martinussen 1989:248).

<A HREF="#23">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e24"></A>It is expected that most credits will be allocated to projects in China, India and in some of the middle-income countries in South East Asia. An amount of DKK 173 m. is currently allocated for this purpose, growing to app. DKK 300 m. in 1997 (app. 6% of bilateral aid).

<A HREF="#24">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e25"></A>One may also find NGOs considering it more easy to receive Danida funding for NGO-projects in countries where Danida itself maintains a country programme. This linkage is, however, excluded in the recent strategy for Danida cooperation with Danish NGOs (Danida 1993g).

<A HREF="#25">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e26"></A>Furthermore, Danish commodity import support programmes had been tied to the supply of Danish goods, but improving foreign exchange balances during recent years in several Danish programme countries have meant less need for this type of assistance. This has also been an important contributing factor to the declining rates of return (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1994b).

<A HREF="#26">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e27"></A>Still, a number of the administrative changes dealt with below stem partly from experiences and recommendations contained in analyses and reports prepared by consultants external to Danida. Compared to the other areas covered in this paper project management stands out as being the least affected by Danida interaction with the aid policy community.

<A HREF="#27">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e28"></A>Currently (autumn 1995) new 'guidelines for programme preparation' are being prepared with the intention to accommodate for the new approach to sector programme assistance and to include more explicit references to the cross-cutting objectives in Danish development assistance, e.g. poverty orientation. The presentation here is based on the 1992-guidelines for project preparation (Danida 1992).

<A HREF="#28">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e29"></A>So far, no `real` country evaluation has been implemented, although Danida 1993b on Zimbabwe and Danida 1995 on Nepal each addresses major aspects related to country programming of Danish assistance. The Zimbabwe study focuses on country programming instruments while the Nepal study analyses the profile of the poverty objective in the country portfolio.

<A HREF="#29">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e30"></A>In 1993 Danida published an interesting study on lessons learned during the ten years since the establishment of the Danida evaluation unit in 1982 (Danida 1993i).

<A HREF="#30">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e31"></A>Policy-based lending is discussed in this paper mainly in relation to World Bank supported adjustment programmes. Like other Western bilateral donors, Danish aid has recently also taken up much more actively issues related to democratisation and human rights. This debate, which is certainly also an expression of the tendency towards more policy-based aid, has primarily been seen in relation to the choice of programme countries for bilateral aid.

<A HREF="#31">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e32"></A>Writing in 1987 Svendsen notes with regard to the IMF and the World Bank that the Nordic countries have kept a low profile, both internationally and in their home constituencies (Svendsen 1987:161).

<A HREF="#32">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e33"></A>In addition, the Nordic countries from the mid-1980s and onwards pursued two other mainly project-related issues in the World Bank: women in development and environmental concerns (Bodelsen 1989).

<A HREF="#33">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e34"></A>A recent Danida evaluation report contrasts the Danish approach with that of Norway who has pursued a `more focused and more instutionalised` use of cofinancing (Danida 1993c:39).

<A HREF="#34">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e35"></A>Five countries, Nicaragua, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique and Bangladesh received more than 80% of Danish balance of payment support during this period.

<A HREF="#35">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e36"></A>It has been argued that the perception of an `over-proportional influence' is a general feature among Danish civil servants involved with EU cooperation (Wæver 1995:284).

<A HREF="#36">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e37"></A>Danish government ministries are headed by civil servants recruited from within the bureaucracy. Thus, contrary to several other Western democracies, permanent secretaries and state secretaries are not politically appointed.

<A HREF="#37">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e38"></A>This is in line with a general tendency for aid administrations to move away from focusing on aid modalities and channels for aid delivery towards geographical and professional concerns gaining more prominence as structuring factors in aid administrations (Administrationsdepartementet 1986a:51).

<A HREF="#38">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e39"></A>The first five Danida field missions had been established in the mid-1970s (Administrationsdepartementet 1986d:4), but it was only a decade later than the number of field missions started to grow as is evident from table 7.

<A HREF="#39">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e40"></A>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been organised along functional lines since the mid-19th century (Udenrigskommissionen 1990:vol. I, 176).

<A HREF="#40">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e41"></A>In addition the forum principle was applied in the sense that within the South Group the multilateral department is organised according to the fora in which Denmark participates (the UN system, the development banks etc.).

<A HREF="#41">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e42"></A>In addition to the figure for total staff in the South Group 1995, 11 staff members worked with aid related issues in the joint Information Secretariat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

<A HREF="#42">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e43"></A>It has been argued that prior to the 1991 reorganisation, the Ministry as such (i.e. not only Danida) was characterised by a very centralised mode of operation compared to the situation in several other ministries and other public sector organisations (Christensen 1992:96).

<A HREF="#43">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e44"></A>Exceptions from this trend might be Danida management of support for NGO information and development projects, and the establishment of a Danida business secretariat. Compared to the `big` questions in relation to ministerial reorganisation, these areas are certainly less central.

<A HREF="#44">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e45"></A>In the period 1987-1990 the Foreign Service as such had been reduced with 80 posts while Danida staffing itself had not been cut (cf. Udenrigskommissionen 1990: vol. I, 27). However, staff increases in Danida in the late 1980s could certainly not make up with the rapid growth in aid allocations.

<A HREF="#45">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e46"></A>Senior ministerial management may not have been the sole group in favour of establishing a common career system for both the North and the South group. For the young and ambitious, the new organisation opened for better and faster opportunities for advancing in the very observable hierarchy of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<A HREF="#46">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e47"></A>Recently, the Minister for Development Cooperation has reappointed the Board for another 3-year term. For the first time since the formative years of the Danish aid programme the composition of the Board has been changed to the effect that representatives from the Danish Youth Council and the Union of Danish Cooperative Societies no longer serve on the Board. In stead representatives from the consulting companies and two major NGOs are nowincluded among the Board members, while the `observer category` has been abandoned.

<A HREF="#47">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e48"></A>While the Board advices the Minister, these recommendation are passed on indirectly via Danida top management, as the Minister does not participate in Board meetings.

<A HREF="#48">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e49"></A>Interestingly, the Council for International Development Cooperation for some politicians served as a model when the Council for European Cooperation was established in 1993 to allow for more involvement of the public in debates on Danish policies towards the EU. Furthermore, counting i.a. on traditions to provide government funds for NGO development education programmes, the Parliament decided to set aside specific budget lines for adult education and popular campaigns on the issue of European integration during Danish debates on the Maastricht Treaty.

<A HREF="#49">[Back to Text]</A><LI><A NAME="e50"></A>It is evident that field experiences and the changing profile and size of NGO and business` project portfolio both have major impacts on the position of these parties in Danish aid debates. It has not been possible, though, to deal with these aspects within the framework of this paper.<A HREF="#50">[Back to Text]</A>

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Campaign against French Nuclear Testing</title>

<h2>Campaign against French nuclear testing in Tahiti</h2>

<p>
<a name="../greenupdate">
<p>

<h2>September 5th Update from Mururoa Atoll</h2>
<h3>Protesters invade exclusion zone</h3>

In a final desperate attempt to delay the French nuclear tests at Mururoa, protesters from the peace flotilla launched inflatables towards the atoll.<p>

They were arrested, but succeeded in reaching the atoll's lagoon.  Their fate is not yet known.  Meanwhile, there has been fresh condemnation of French President Jacques Chirac's decision to resume testing.<p>

The former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev endorsed Greenpeace's action.  The French ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau also called on Chirac to change his mind and cancel the tests.<p>

The peace flotilla around Mururoa includes 12 boats from New Zealand, 4 from Greenpeace (although two have been stormed by the French), a Danish and a German boat, as well as a Polynesian canoe.<p>

Mururoa atoll has been shaken by 140 previous French nuclear explosions.  Thirteen nuclear bombs were exploded in the atmosphere before 1975.  The environmental and health effects on local populations have been inadequately studied by the French military, according to anti-nuclear campaigners.

<h3>French commandos attack again</h3>
Soon after dawn local time, September 1st  - around 4.0 pm GMT - the Rainbow Warrior crossed into the Mururoa exclusion zone. It was quickly pursued by French commandos in inflatables who boarded it. 
<p>
The commandos used oxyacetylene cutting equipment in an attack described as far more professional than the one on July 9th. 
<p>
<h3>The next French test </h3>
September 1st is the eve of the most widely-protested of French nuclear tests  - possibly the first of eight explosions in the area. 
<p>
A large demonstration in protest at the tests is expected on Tahiti on September 2nd. The French are thought to be developing two new war-heads, one intended for a submarine-launched missile. 

<p>

<h3>In Britain</h3> 
The British Ministry of Defence has announced an end to its nuclear test explosions, and the intention to rely instead on computer simulations.<p>

<h3>"Say Non"</h3>
French citizens have been strongly divided in their reactions to an anti-nuclear commercial broadcast last week on French television - and on the Internet. 
 <p>
The 30-second commercial recommends the boycotting of French wines until Chirac stops nuclear testing in Polynesia. Although it is undoubtedly powerful and stylish, you may feel its use of a violent metaphor - however ironical and allusive - is questionable.

<h3><i>Teargas used as French warships ram the Warrior</i></h3>

<b>The Greenpeace mission to Mururoa Atoll has come to a brutal end - on Sunday 9 July French commandos stormed the Rainbow Warrior and arrested the entire crew.</b><p>

The Greenpeace ship was surrounded at 6.40am local time, inside the Mururoa exclusion zone, by four warships - one of which had been shadowing the ship for several days.  Up to 140 marines stormed aboard from rubber inflatable motorboats.<p>


According to the French Greenpeace spokesman on the Warrior, Jean-Luc Thierry, a warship rammed the Warrior, and commandos used teargas to overpower the protesters.  A radio interview being given by Thierry was cut off in mid sentence as the marines seized Greenpeace equipment.<p>


<p>

<b><li>12.00 GMT, 13 July</b> - A Greenpeace inflatable with three crew on board
remains undetected in the vicinity of the test site. <p>

Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills, on board the Rainbow Warrior, said
Greenpeace would continue to scale up its protest as long as the
French authorities continued to prepare for a resumption of
nuclear testing at Moruroa.  She said the inflatable crew would
remain at the test site and was prepared stay around or go into
the atoll to further disrupt preparations for testing there.<p>
 
<b>The three people aboard the inflatable are Henk Haazen
(Netherlands), Chris Robinson (Australia) and honourary chairman
of Greenpeace, David McTaggart (Canada).  All are very
experienced seafarers, equipped with full emergency and safety
gear and able to communicate with Greenpeace.</b><p>
 
The three sailing vessels will meet to discuss further plans for
protest against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific and
to re-supply the Bifrost which has been at sea since leaving the
Cook Islands on June 29.  They will also celebrate the 39th
birthday of Steve Sawyer, currently on board the Vega.  Steve was
celebrating his 29th birthday on July 10 1985, when the first
Rainbow Warrior was bombed by French secret service agents in
Auckland harbour, killing photographer Fernando Pereira.<p>
 
Also aboard the Vega is Manuel Miroglio (France) and Jean-Marc
van Chinh (France).  <p>

<hr>
 
<h3>Moruroa, 12pm July 11 local time:</h3><b>The Rainbow Warrior today
sails for Papeete, Tahiti from the nuclear test site at Moruroa,
to support Tahitian protest against nuclear testing on Bastille
Day, July 14th.</b><p>
 
The Rainbow Warrior, which was boarded and tear-gassed by French
commandos two days ago, is now in international waters outside
the nuclear test site.  Two other protest vessels, the Vega and
the Bifrost, are hove to outside the test site, and a Greenpeace
inflatable with David McTaggart, Henk Haazen and Chris Robinson
aboard remain undetected in the vicinity of Moruroa.<p>
 
The Rainbow Warrior will sail from Moruroa this afternoon local
time and expects to arrive Papeete by midday July 14th.  Its
arrival will coincide with protests at French embassies and
consulates around the world at President Chirac's decision to
resume nuclear tests at the atoll in September.<p>
 

Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry, aboard the Rainbow Warrior,
said the Rainbow Warrior would show solidarity with the Tahitian
people in their strong opposition to nuclear tests.<p>
 
"The real revolutionary spirit of Bastille Day will be more
present in the streets of Papeete with those who protest the
resumption of testing than amongst the military preparing their
deadly task at Moruroa," he said.  "The vision of liberty,
equality and fraternity is meaningless for the people of
Polynesia while tests continue."<p>
 
Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said liberty from nuclear testing
would be the best present France could offer the international
community on Bastille Day.<p>
 
"The Greenpeace protest will continue and increase both at
Moruroa and around the world," she said.  "Our inflatable crew
remain undetected in the vicinity of the test site, the Vega is
on the edge of the 12 mile exclusion zone, and the Rainbow
Warrior will be back."<p>

          Luc Thierry leans halfway out the porthole and

          continues to talk to French media via satellite phone
          until commandos enter the room.<p>

<li><b>0700</b>      Two Greenpeace activists are removed from the drilling
          rig by French commandos.  All four inflatable crews are
          taken to Moruroa.<p>

          Journalists aboard the Rainbow Warrior, Oscar Temaru,
          Monseigneur Jacques Gaillot and Pastor Temarama are
          taken aboard a French military vessel and transported
          to Moruroa atoll. <p>

          Commandos and maritime police take over control of the
          Rainbow Warrior and a tow line is attached to a tug.<p>

<li><b>0930</b>      The Rainbow Warrior crew demand that the inflatable
          crew are allowed to re-join the ship.<p>

<li><b>1000</b>      Gendarmerie maritime (maritime police) demand to
          interrogate the women crew members on board the Rainbow
          Warrior individually.  The captain and crew refuse to 
          do this and demand access to a lawyer.  The French
          authorities back down.<p>

<li><b>1005</b>      The Rainbow Warrior is towed into the Moruroa lagoon
          and moored onto a buoy inside the entrance to the
          lagoon.  Skipper Dave Enever continues to refuse to
          leave the ship until all his crew are returned to it.<p>

 
          Meanwhile, interrogation of inflatable crew by the
          maritime  police is going on Moruroa atoll. The crew
          refuse to give their identities, merely saying their
          name is "Fernando Pereira", the photographer killed
          during the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985.  The
          inflatable crew non-violently resist the orders of the
          maritime police, who use French foreign legionnaires 
          to carry their limp bodies from interrogation room to
          holding rooms.  <p>


<li><b>1300</b>      The crew of the Rainbow Warrior, still refusing to
          leave their ship until the other crew are returned and

          an assessment of damage to the ship is done, is told 
          by the French authorities that they will forcibly be

          removed from the ship.  A party of French foreign
          legionnaires board the ship and force the crew, some 
          of whom resisting non-violently by going limp, onto a
          transport vessel.  The French authorities force David
          Enever, the skipper, to remain on the Rainbow Warrior.<p>

<li><b>1400</b>      The Rainbow Warrior crew are disembarked at Moruroa and

          taken to a holding room pending interrogation.  They
          demand to see their captain and the rest of the crew. <p>


          They are interrogated individually, fingerprinted and
          photographed.  The French military refuse to tell them
          whether they are under arrest or not, and refuse access
          to lawyers.  In spite of French propaganda that the
          crew are free to walk around the atoll, they are in
          fact under guard at all times by French foreign
          legionnaires who physically manhandle them to prevent
          them walking away from the holding rooms.<p>

<li><b>2000</b>      After protracted negotiations between the skipper, Dave
          Enever and French authorities, French foreign
          legionnaires take half the crew to the dock at Moruroa
          and tell them to board a transport vessel back to the
          Rainbow Warrior.  The crew refuse to do anything until
          their captain and rest of crew arrive, and sit down on
          the dock.  Journalists waiting on the dock are forcibly
          prevented from asking questions of the crew by military
          personnel who place their hands over the mouths of
          reporters and put a human barricade of foreign
          legionnaires between the crew and media.  A truckload
          more of foreign legionnaires arrive to guard the crew.<p>

<li><b>2100 </b>     The rest of the crew and then finally Greenpeace France
          campaigner Jean-Luc Thierry and skipper Dave Enever
          arrive at the dock.  Negotiations continue: Dave Enever
          refuses to return to the Rainbow Warrior without the
          vessel's inflatables and safety equipment such as hand-
          held navigational equipment and radiation protection
          gear being returned to the ship.<p>

<li><b>2230 </b>     The French authorities refuse to return the ship's
          equipment except for one inflatable. They announce that
          they will tow the ship into international waters and
          demand that Greenpeace pledge not to return to the test
          site.  Skipper David Enever repeats Greenpeace's
          demands for the return of the equipment and says that
          as long as France prepares for nuclear tests at the
          atoll, Greenpeace will be prepared to come back.<p>

<li><b>2245 </b>     Greenpeace crew sit on the dock, fearing use of force
          by the French authorities.  Around 100 French foreign
          legionnaires encircle the crew and bodily lift them
          into a transport vessel.  The crew are taken back to
          the ship and begin the clean-up of the ship.<p>

<li><b>2345 </b>     The Rainbow Warrior is towed by a tug toward
          international waters.  The ship remains under the
          control of French foreign legion and commandos but
          communications links are re-established.</ul>

 
<h3>Monday July 10</h3>
<ul><li><b>0200</b>      French commandos and foreign legion leave the ship.  
          It stays in international waters, under the watchful 
          eye of at least four French warships.<p>

<li><b>0900</b>      Rainbow Warrior crew assess damage to the ship.  Broken
          windows on the bridge have been repaired but will
          require further strengthening.  The twisted antennae
          are lashed up and the hole in the bow requires further
          work but does not prevent the ship from being
          seaworthy.<p>

<li><b>1100</b>      The Rainbow Warrior makes radio contact with the Vega
          and Bifrost and agrees to rendezvous with the two
          vessels north of Moruroa at 1530 hours.<p>

<li><b>1530</b>      The Viking model ship Bifrost, Vega and Rainbow Warrior
          meet 30 miles north of Moruroa to discuss further
          protest plans and to celebrate the birthday of Steve
          Sawyer with a barbecue on board the Rainbow Warrior.</ul><p>

<h2>Protest Action planned for July 14th</h2>

<b>In an uncanny coincidence, the seizure of the Warrior came ten years to the day after the first Rainbow Warrior was blown up in Auckland Harbour by French secret service divers, killing the photographer Fernando Pereira.</b><p>

Further protests are planned in Polynesian islands.  Speaking to OneWorld Online, the Chairman of the <a href="../../com_fnd/path_piango.html">Pacific Islands Association of NGOs</a>, Gaby Tetiarahi, called for mass anti-French protests - to coincide with Bastille Day on 14 July.<p>

<b><i>"Our message is to please support the Tahitian people here," he said, "and the best thing to do would be if people in the whole world could demonstrate on the French national day."</i></b><p>

<hr><p>


<b>On 13 June 1995 President Jacques Chirac announced a resumption of underground nuclear testing on the South Pacific atoll of Mururoa.</b><p>
  
<i>A storm of international condemnation followed the decision, and the environmental group Greenpeace is taking measures to begin a direct action campaign against the testing, which it claims has led to an increase in cancer rates and birth defects in island populations.</i><p>© Greenpeace International
<hr><p>

<h2>The Tahitian situation</h2>

<b><i>'If underground nuclear weapons tests are so safe,why don't the French conduct them on their own soil?'</i></b><p>
<hr=30%>

Action against the resumption of nuclear weapons testing is being co-ordinated in the island of Tahiti by a coalition of oppositional political parties, NGOs and unions - Greenpeace is merely an "observer" of the process, according to its representative Arnaud Apoteker.<p>

<b>"I think the mood of the population is very angry," he said.  "And for the political parties in opposition the anti-testing issue and concerns about French imperialism are closely connected."</b><p>

The protest coalition is operating a rolling programme of continual action - a recent attempt to build a 'peace village' outside official buildings in the Tahitian capital Papeete was prevented by government intervention, but more demonstrations are planned.<p>

According to Apoteker, the head of the island's government is a "very close friend of Jacques Chirac" - politically as well as personally - and feels unable to oppose a resumption of testing, despite the widespread opposition.  The issue is further complicated by the heavy dependence of the Tahitian economy on French military expenditure and subsidy.<p>

The actual incidence of radiation-induced diseases on Tahiti is impossible to quantify, Greenpeace claim, because of a lack of reliable information.  Efforts to study radioactive leakage from Mururoa by the group have been continually hampered by the French military. <p>
 
However, Apoteker points out that many workers on the atoll, who have received doses of radiation, either retire to Tahiti or commute between the two islands.  In any case, anxiety about French motivations is necessarily running high.  'If underground nuclear weapons tests are so safe,' goes a frequently-asked question, 'why don't the French conduct them on their own soil?'
<p>

<p>
<h2>Update: August 14th</h2>
On August 14th the Rainbow Warrior left Suva, Fiji, heading back to the French nuclear test site at Mururoa.<p>

The crew had spent a busy time at Suva, repairing damage done to the Warrior when it was rammed by a French naval tug on July 10.  The ship also had to be re-equipped with inflatable boats, as the French military seized all but one of the original complement at Mururoa.<p>

The crew have reported "totally enthusiastic support" for the Warrior's mission in all the places they have visited in the South Pacific.  Stores were donated and given on credit by local businesses in Fiji.<p>

Around 200 people gathered on the dock at Suva as the Rainbow Warrior sailed, en route to join an 'international peace flotilla' which is gathering near Mururoa.  Around 9000 people demonstrated against French nuclear testing in Western Samoa, on August 13th.<p>

The "European initiative":<br>Cooperation between advisory councils at European

level</h2>

<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>

<h3>The beginnings</h3>



In 1991 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) provided the

initiative for cooperation between European advisory bodies in the field of development

cooperation. A workshop was held, at which it became clear that the participants were interested

in continuing this form of contact. One important point to emerge was that the agendas of the

different countries were largely the same - further evidence that coordination could enhance the

impact of national advisory work. The European Commission was also convinced of this fact and

twice invited the advisors to Brussels to give their advice on the implications of the Maastricht

Treaty which, in its provisions on development cooperation, envisages a greater role for European

cooperation. Subjects with a European dimension also occupy an important place in the NAR's

regular advisory activities.

<p>

<h3>Workshop in Feldafing, FRG (November 1994)</h3>



In the run-up to the follow-up meeting, the NAR commissioned a <A HREF="nar_adv.htm">study of the advisory structure

in 17 European countries</A>. This revealed that external policy advice is obtained in a wide variety of

ways in the different countries. The countries of northern Europe tend to opt for advice 'at arm's

length' from a body that is independent and has a fixed structure (a council), while southern

European administrations seem to prefer to obtain advice on each subject individually, on a contract

basis and with various partners. One important conclusion drawn from the study is that

cooperation on the basis of pragmatic considerations would seem to offer the best chance of

success.

<p>

The study was welcomed by delegates at the follow-up meeting, which the FRG organised during

its presidency of the European Union. The Wissenschaftliche Beirat beim Bundesministerium

f&uuml;r wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung which hosted the meeting had taken the

lead with the drawing up of a joint advisory report entitled The <A HREF="nar_comp.htm">Comparative Effectiveness and the

Coordination Efforts of EU Donors</A>.The report, which was drawn up by a team of three authors,

from Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, explores the scope for improving aid

(policy, procedures, instruments, evaluation etc.) by cooperating at European level. It was

approved by the meeting and subsequently presented by the delegates to their overseas aid

ministers. The Council of Ministers of the EU discussed the same subject shortly afterwards.

<p>

The NAR contribution to the report consisted of a <A HREF="hoeb95.htm">comparative study of the effectiveness and

evaluation efforts of EU donors</a>. The Council has since  published this contribution separately.

Cooperation of Advisory Structures for Development Cooperation Policy:<br> A Survey in 17 European Countries

</h3></center>

This information is drawn from the report of a survey (1993-1994) carried out by the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) on behalf of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) in the Netherlands. The full-text of this report is broken up into an <A HREF = "#intro">introduction</a>, a series of <a href="../country.htm">country</a> sections, and a <a href="adv_syn.htm">synthesis</a> chapter.

<hr><h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

This report describes in broad terms the possibilities for cooperation between Advisory Councils for Development

Cooperation, including other institutions that may have an advisory function for development cooperation policy in

the current 12 Member States of the EU as well as in the three new Member States, Norway, and Switzerland.

<p>

The report is the result of a one year survey carried out by the European Centre for Development Policy

Management (ECDPM) on behalf of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) in the

Netherlands. The survey was conducted by Annemiek Kooij under a contract with ECDPM. The report was written by Annemiek Kooij and Ren&#233; Mevis, deputy secretary to the NAR.

<p>

In 1989, the Irish Advisory Council on Development Cooperation (the predecessor of the current Aid Advisory

Committee) and the NAR decided to initiate activities for cooperation between advisory institutions for

development cooperation policy in Europe. A need was felt to strengthen national advisory activities, and to

contribute to the strengthening of the coherence and coordination of EU development policy. 

<p>

In 1991, the idea was discussed in a workshop in The Hague, with participants from several advisory institutions in

Europe. The meeting was also attended by a representative of the Directorate General for Development Cooperation

(DG VIII) of the European Commission (NAR, 1992). Participants concluded that policy making on national as

well as on European level could benefit from coordinated or joint advisory efforts. It was decided that efforts for

cooperation should be continued. A subsequent NAR report on development cooperation after the Treaty of

Maastricht in 1993 recommended that one of the ways for cooperation was for members of several interested

advisory institutions in Europe to produce a joint report on a common theme (NAR, 1993).

<p>

In June and December 1993, DG VIII organised meetings to build up direct and bilateral contacts with experts and

researchers in EU Member States. These were attended by several members of Councils and institutes that were

also involved in the cooperation activities that resulted from the workshop held in the Hague. DG VIII clearly

focuses on gaining access to information and knowledge that is available in Europe for its policy-making. Both

initiatives run parallel, and sometimes they meet. This report might give some clues for a possible common future.

<p>

In 1993, NAR asked ECDPM to explore more detailed possibilities for further cooperation of advisory institutions

and structures for development cooperation. Terms of Reference were designed along the following lines:

<ol>

<li>To conduct a survey of existing advisory structures, of which the results could be discussed at a workshop.

<li>To collect and disseminate information among participants in the survey and among interested institutions,

concentrating on published recommendations. Where appropriate, the feasibility of publishing English summaries

of recommendations should be discussed, in order to facilitate future exchange of information among participants,

notably by NAR and ECDPM.

<li>To explore the feasibility of a follow-up meeting of the 1991 workshop in The Hague.

<li>To indicate ways for the continuation and strengthening of future cooperation.

</ol>

<p>

The survey would focus on Formal Advisory Institutions, i.e. Advisory Councils for Development Cooperation

Policy installed by the Government, and which have the explicit mandate to advise the Government on matters of

development cooperation policy. This definition does not take into account other characteristics, such as

procedures, right of initiative or actually performed functions; these were to be considered as secondary. 'Policy'

was defined as general development policy, excluding specific policies for sectors or countries. A Council can be

classified in this category when at least its mandate permits it to advise on general policy questions; actually it may

also cover other areas. These Institutions are described in this report under the paragraphs two of each country

report, headed 'Formal Advisory Institutions'. Other institutions that might have a policy advisory function are

described in the paragraphs three, 'Other Actors'.

<p>

NAR and ECDPM agreed further that in those countries where there are no Formal Advisory Institutions, leading

research institutes that may have a policy advisory function would be included in the survey. All advisory

institutions, structures and mechanisms in those countries are described under the heading 'Advisory Structures and

Mechanisms'. Research institutes were supposed to have expertise on issues that are essential both to policy

making by national Governments and by the EU institutions.



For the survey, literature on the 17 countries was studied and interviews were held with representatives of relevant

institutions in 14 countries (no interviews were held with institutions in Greece, Italy and Luxembourg).

<p>

In the country reports, Advisory Councils for Development Cooperation and other institutions that may have an

advisory function are described in their policy and administrative context. The last paragraphs connect with

advisory  aspects of the work of NGOs and other relevant groups in society. Country reports include descriptions

of: 1) development cooperation: history and support; policies and changes; administrative structures; policy

planning and coordination; policy papers; 2) advisory institutions and structures: history and tasks; membership;

procedures; agenda's and publications; 3) other actors: Parliament; NGOs; research institutes; private enterprise.

<p>

The final chapter summarises the main characteristics and trends observed in the description of development

cooperation policies and administrative structures, and it summarises and categorises the various advisory

structures. It concludes with an overview of possibilities for future cooperation between advisory institutions in

Europe. 

<p>

Many aspects of development cooperation are covered in the country reports. However, the authors have no

intention to be complete. Including an aspect serves to place advisory structures and their functioning in the

relevant context. The survey is not an evaluation. It intends to give a fair picture of structures and activities as they

are reported in documents and discussions. Naturally, all opinions expressed and observations reported are the

responsibility of the authors.

Exit the Dragon</h1>

<font size=+1>Is dissent in the exile community a sign of nascent democracy or disintegration? Is Tibet on the brink of a bloody intifada? Above all, what can be done to help?</font><p>

<i>China's pride, Lhasa's loss. Tibetan houses have been razed to make way for a Tiananmen-style square in front of the Potala Palace, once home to the Dalai Lama</i><br clear=left><p>


'We are all school dropouts,' says Jamyang Norbu cheerfully. 'None of us has a degree.' That's strange. The small band of people who have set up this cultural institute, Amnye Machen, have been described to me as the 'intellectual cream' of the exile community in Dharamsala.<p>
 
But the government information officer who conferred this praise went on to say: 'Unfortunately they have been printing reports critical of the Government-in-Exile. This demoralizes Tibetans in Tibet. It's playing into the hands of the Chinese.' <p>

Some ultra-conservative religious leaders have gone so far as to accuse Amnye Machen of working for the Chinese. Jamyang Norbu has himself received death threats.<p>

He's an energetic and loquacious man, clearly more inclined to speak his mind than to be cautious. Above his desk is a picture of exiled Chinese dissident Harry Wu, himself a supporter of the Tibetan cause. <p>

Jamyang Norbu is critical. He thinks religion is still too influential in Tibetan society and is holding back the struggle for independence. It would be better, he says, if the Tibetan Administration directed its energies towards studying China. 'They don't know the nature of this enemy. This enemy does not respond to compassion.' <p>

More controversial yet, he is critical of the Dalai Lama's unwavering commitment to non-violence. 'All the options have to be looked at,' he says. He is not advocating violence but he does point out that those who have used it - like the PLO - get taken seriously by the international community.<p>

Such views have prompted foreign journalists to cast Amyne Machen as 'the opposition' to the Government-in-Exile. 'That's a very Western view of politics,' says Jamyang. What Amnye Machen is doing, he says, is not opposing but providing another perspective which is at times critical.<p>
 
In one major respect Amnye Machen's goal is identical to the Dalai Lama's - they want to keep Tibetan culture alive. They publish books by Tibetan writers in Tibetan. But they also think that one way of keeping Tibetan culture alive is to keep it fed with foreign ideas, so they have translated into Tibetan for the first time the works of George Orwell, Vaclav Havel and others. <p>

Kharma Samden, a Tibetan Youth Congress member, has similar feelings of frustration with the current leadership. 'It's very traditional,' he says. 'The democratic structures may be in place but it is very difficult to criticize openly. People take it so personally. I am not saying get rid of tradition - but it has to be combined with a modern education and a sense of what is going on in the world.'<p>

<h3>Intimations of intifada </h3>

<i>Illegal image: the Chinese have prohibited the sale of images of the Dalai Lama like the one this farmer wears around his neck.</i><p>

What is going on in China is the key to Tibet's future. Beijing is losing its grip on its provinces. The economic disparity between the rich coastal areas and the poor inland areas is throwing up all sorts of problems. Farmers are leaving the countryside and moving to the cities. Unemployment is high and there are fears of insurrection. <p>

Tibetans in exile hope that China will disintegrate a la Soviet Union. New leaders in Beijing, they reason, will make negotiations easier. Maybe. And then again, maybe not. A fair deal for Tibet may not feature at all on their list of priorities, although Tibetans in exile have been forging links with exiled Chinese dissenters such as Jan Jiaqi, who leads the Federation for a Democratic China.<p>
 
Meanwhile, according to one of the foremost experts on Tibet, US historian Melvyn Goldstein, the situation in Tibet right now is dangerously volatile. A decline into violence is, he says, a 'realistic assumption'.<p>

'China's policy in Tibet is in shambles,' he says. Bringing the free market to Tibet was supposed to create 'modern' Tibetans who would abandon hopes of independence in favour of making money. But they have not materialized. This is because the core problem - of massive Chinese migration - is not being addressed. 'Tibetans are unlikely to stand on the sidelines for much longer watching Beijing transform the demography and economy of their homeland with impunity,' says Goldstein. <p>

He goes on to warn: 'Nationalistic emotions coupled with desperation and anger make a powerful brew. And there are Tibetans inside and outside Tibet who are intoxicated with the idea of beginning such a campaign focused on violence - in their view a Òwar of conscienceÓ, a Tibetan-style intifada.' With this in mind arms dealers are already moving in to try to supply Tibetans, according to Robbie Barnett of the Tibetan Information Network.<p>

What if violence does erupt? If Tibetans had recourse to serious violence - as they did in 1959 - this would most likely provoke a heavy-handed Chinese response along the lines of the Tiananmen Square massacre. If the violence spilled outside Tibet this could impact on the internal stability of China itself. One of Beijing's worst-case scenarios is for serious disturbances in Tibet to spread to other minority areas such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and the Muslim (Hui) areas in Gansu. This might help Tibet - but it might equally lead to an even tighter clampdown.<p>

According to Goldstein the Tibetan leadership has three options: it can carry on campaigning for international support and wait in the hope that China disintegrates; it can encourage or organize violent opposition in Tibet, maybe forcing China to adopt a more conciliatory line; or it can compromise by sending Beijing a clear message that the Dalia Lama is prepared to scale down even further his political demands in order to preserve the ethnically homogenous Tibetan homeland. <p>

Goldstein says that a possible compromise would leave the Chinese in control but would appoint Tibetans to all positions of power in Tibet, make Tibetan the official language and reduce the number of Chinese migrants.<p>

It's hard to imagine either side agreeing to this. The Chinese have nothing to gain by it. And the Tibetans would find it hard to accept something that falls so far short of independence.


<h3>Paper tigers </h3>

One of the problems facing those trying to resolve 'the Tibet issue' is that the status quo actually suits the international community very nicely. As long as Tibetans can be encouraged to maintain their non-violent stance and there is not much blood being openly spilled on the streets of Lhasa then governments can go on trading with China without too much protest from their own people.<p>

Governments occasionally do their duty by mentioning human rights and China duly has a fit of pique but does nothing to change its ways. And that is that. It's by now a well-known ritual that does nothing to put in jeopardy trade links and access to the markets of the third-largest economy in the world. Boycotting Chinese goods or imposing trade restrictions could hit China where it hurts. But there is little inclination to do it. No-one really wants to say boo to the dragon too loudly.<p>

	The United Nations has been equally ineffectual. In 1959, 1961 and 1965 UN resolutions called for China to 'respect the human rights and freedoms of Tibetans'. Nothing changed. In March 1994 China persuaded the UN for the fourth year running to reject a modestly worded resolution criticizing its human-rights record. In the same year China avoided censure by only one vote at the annual meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.<p>

Western legislators have often been ready to criticize China's policy in Tibet: the US Congress has passed many such resolutions, Australia's National Assembly did so in 1990 and the European Parliament has recently been adding an increasingly strong voice of complaint. But the words are not backed up by governmental action.<p>

In 1993, for example, US President Clinton announced he would only renew China's Most Favoured Nation trading status if it cleaned up its human-rights record. At last, said supporters of Tibet. But Clinton turned out to be a paper tiger. A year later China had not improved its record and yet the status was renewed all the same. <p>

<h3>Drops in the cup</h3>



So what can be done, apart from keeping up the pressure on politicians? Back in London I go and visit Phuntsok Wangyal, founder of the Tibet Foundation. A former resistance fighter who joined up at the age of 14, Phuntsok is well known for his strong views on independence. <p>

But he wears quite a different hat at the Tibet Foundation. This non-political organization is doing things that can be done: small-scale development projects to improve the situation of Tibetans in Tibet, mainly in the areas of health, education, rural small business and pastoralism. To do these things they have to get the approval and co-operation of the Chinese. Is this, I ask, not akin to sleeping with the enemy?<p>

'The Chinese know who I am and my personal views are unchanged. But I must not let that get in the way of working to improve the conditions of Tibetans. We have to deal with the Chinese. That is the reality.'<p>

He firmly believes that the future lies with Tibetans inside Tibet, not with the exile community. And so the most important thing is to make sure those Tibetans are getting a good education and adequate healthcare. 'If they have these they will be better able to change the future circumstances of Tibetans.' <p>

Some quite serious compromises have to be made. For example in the rural schools they are setting up for Tibetan children it is the Chinese version of history which has to be taught - the one that says Tibet is a part of China. <p>

'We need not make everything political,' says Phuntsok. 'We must never forget the importance of educating our kids.'<p>

Phuntsok's focused and specific approach is reflected in his views on bigger issues: like how to reach a settlement with China. 'What we need to do is ask ourselves - what is China afraid of? We know that when China is afraid it has to control everything. If we could allay some of those fears then maybe we could start getting somewhere with our negotiations.'<p>

For example, China has always feared that if it did not occupy Tibet then India would. 'If there could be an assurance from India that this is not the case, it might help.'<p>

Another fear is that China is going to run out of half the staple minerals essential to its economic growth within the next decade. 'Perhaps,' says Phuntsok, 'Tibet could commit itself to share some of its resources with China and to use Chinese rather than other foreign expertise to help extract them. This would be a way of protecting some of China's economic interests.'<p>

This sounds like good sense. After all, it is economic rather than ideological interests that are keeping the Chinese in Tibet today. Though reducing Chinese migration to Tibet will be a harder issue to resolve.<p>

On the issue of independence as the ultimate goal, however, Phuntsok remains as firm as ever.<p>

'People have to have some hope - whether they achieve it or not. For example, I am a Buddhist and so enlightenment is my final objective. When I light a butter lamp, do prostrations, chant <i>om mani padme hum</i>, I am putting something into the cup that might in the end lead to the cup overflowing and enlightenment. I know that my attainment of enlightenment is unrealistic - yet I do it. It's a lot more unrealistic than the prospect of independence for Tibet. But it is very important to have an objective.'<p>

In the course of researching and writing this issue of NI, time and again a wave of despair would wash over me. 'But it's hopeless,' I would say very quietly to myself. Phuntsok's approach is a powerful antidote to such despair. It's this kind of attitude which brought about the collapse of apartheid, the end of colonial rule in India and the restoration of democracy in Eastern Europe.<p>

It's easy to forget just how often 'the impossible' has been achieved by people working in small ways, each adding their drop to the cup.

<h3>Summary of the findings of a recent review of World Bank supported agricultural extension projects</h3>
<p>
A recent review of 33 free-standing extension projects approved after 1977, plus a further 76 projects having an extension component, noted that the Training and Visit approach had been successful in the Green Revolution context providing that certain basic principles were met: clearly-defined farming systems; technology 'on the shelf', with a high B:C ratio; and complementary resources readily available, especially in irrigated areas.
<p>
However, outside favourable areas, the performance of T&V- based extension projects has generally been weak:
<p>
 - returns to extension are high only if prices are right and complementary services are available (including input supply); frequently these conditions are not met, especially in the more difficult environments; extension has generally been more successful as a component of wider projects which aim to meet at least some of these conditions;
<p>
- inadequate understanding of farming systems, and of farmers' opportunities and constraints (including their risk-aversion practices and coping strategies) commonly means that recommendations are inappropriate;
<p>
- the number of relevant messages for difficult environments is generally limited, and without a steady stream of new technologies, the marginal returns to successive visits by extensionists are likely to diminish rapidly; 
<p>
- current extension models (i.e. especially T&V) are generally too expensive to be fiscally sustainable beyond the duration of external credits;
<p>
- the specific needs, opportunities and constraints faced by women farmers have generally been neglected;
<p>
- the 'contact farmer' mechanism of T&V rarely works as well as intended, and group organisation has rarely been a recognised component of extensionists' activities. For both these reasons, the impact of T&V on human resource development has generally been weak.

to show the roots of such alternative action reaching back through punk
anarchism to the hippie counterculture of Theodore Roszak and beyond. It
is in the Establishment's interest for cultural revolts to be dismissed
as ineffectual by succeeding generations. As was true for feminists, uncovering
roots is all-important &shyp; it helps today's activists not to feel isolated,
to draw heart and strength from previous generations' resistance.<BR>

<a name="com"><hr><h2><i>Complementarity between the development policies and actions of the Union and of its member states</i></h2></a>

<ol>

<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>

The resolution adopted in the follow-up to "Horizon2000" aims at increasing the efficiency

of coordination mechanisms already in place. Ministers stressed the importance of increasing

complementarity for the effectiveness of Member States and Community policies, and

recognised that such complementarity was in no way a threat for national policies.

<ul>

<li>The Resolution of December 1993 will therefore be put into place. Actions required include: 

<li>defining joint sectoral guidelines where necessary; 

<li>holding meetings of experts on sectoral policies; 

<li>testing operational coordination in developing countries; 

<li>coordination at international conferences and meetings. 

</ul><p>

Together with this, regular meetings of Director-Generals for informal discussion of questions

of common interest and follow-up to the coordination and complementarity process will be

implemented.More attention should be given to decentralising the decision-making process at

local level for certain categories of project and programme. The likelihood that co-financing instruments between the Community and the Member States

may assist the complementarity objective should be further studied. 

<p>

Improved coordination should also apply to the aid programming process. Formulating NIPs

for ACP countries and country strategies for the ALA and MED countries should be seen as

an opportunity for a joint examination of the actions of the Community.



</ol>

<p>



<a name="hum"><hr><h2><i>Human Rights</i></h2>

<ol>

<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>



The Council adopted a standard clause that will allow the Union to suspend agreements

concluded with third countries as soon as these countries violate human rights. Agreements

in future will include an article requiring the respect of democratic principles and fundamental

human rights as set out in the universal Declaration on Human Rights and the final Helsinki

Act and the Paris Charter. (At roughly the same time, however, the Council proposed to cut

EU budget lines destined for Human Rights work.) 



</ol>



<p>

<a name="reg"><hr><h2><i>Support for regional integration efforts by developing countries</i></h2></a>

<ol>

<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>

 



This resolution was taken against the background of the increasing number of initiatives aimed

at regional integration among developing countries.This includes the lowering of barriers to

improve the free movement of goods, services,capital and people.  The Council considers that

regional integration can help to create a favourable general framework provided that:

<ul> 

<li>the institutional framework is both stable and adaptable; 

<li>sufficient openness is maintained towards third countries; 

<li>suitable financial systems are available or are set up; 

<li>the private sector and civil society take an active part in the process of integration; 

<li>the costs and benefits of integration are shared out fairly. 

</ul>

<p>

Support for regional integration must be tailored to the requirements of the countries

concerned,and must not have the effect of discriminating against other countries in the same

region. Development cooperation policy must be based on: 

<ul>

<li>developing capabilities and strengthening institutions; 

<li>support for the private sector. 

</ul>

<p>

The Council notes that the existence of certain trade preferences may be a means of

supporting regional integration. Coordination needs to be stepped up between the Community

and the Member States, with consultation amongst them within international organisations

and at international conferences.

</ol>

<p>

<a name="str"><hr><h2><i>Structural Adjustment</i></h2></a>



<ol>

<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>

On the basis of two Commission documents, the first on Community support to structural

adjustment in ACP countries and the second a working document on this policy in the

southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, the Ministers adopted a resolution which puts

forward recommendations to the Commission. 

<p>

According to the resolution, particular attention should continue to be given to more

appropriate conditionality, local capacity for analysis and to taking account of the regional

dimension in the content of certain adjustment programmes. While setting out the improvements made due to the implementation of SAPs, the Council also draws attentions to the inadequacies of the present system. It invited the Commission:

<ul> 

<li>to continue to improve the budget process and maintain adequate levels of investment; 

<li>to ensure that temporary funding is provided for the transitional costs that may accompany

   the costs of placing programmes in a regional trade facilitation or economic integration

   framework;

<li>to assess the impact of the measures concerned on men and women; 

<li>to move from targeting counterpart funds towards more general allocation as soon as

   effective monitoring of the instruments has been achieved; 

<li>to increase the involvement of the States concerned in the monitoring of implementation; 

<li>to ensure greater coherence of Union action in implementing all the Community instruments; 

<li>to take account of external payment obligations when they have a lasting impact on poverty. 

</ul>

<p>

In conclusion, the Council stated that the Community should involve itself more effectively

and harmoniously in support of the structural adjustment process which remains one of the

most important instruments of development cooperation policy. 

</ol>

<h1>Men and their sexual and reproductive health </h1>










<b>by Evert Ketting</b><p>




The current wave of interest in male involvement in family planning, sexual and reproductive health is not new. Since the late 1970s, the issue has repeatedly been discussed in the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in family planning associations and in other agencies interested in reaching men, particularly organizations which concentrate on vasectomy and on promoting condom use.  <p>




However, the adoption of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action in 1994, which expanded the field of family planning to take in the whole area of sexual and reproductive health, has created renewed interest in the role, behaviour and needs of men. 
<p>



The rationales for male involvement and the approaches taken in male involvement initiatives have changed over the years. Initially, men were seen primarily as obstacles to female acceptance of family planning; now programmes tend to focus on men as partners, or as potential clients who have sexual and reproductive health needs themselves.
<p>



The following are some of the reasons given for giving more attention to male involvement.
<p>
<ul>


<li>	Men are more interested in reproductive health information than is often assumed. In fact, the strong focus on women in reproductive health programmes makes some men feel excluded, even though their role in it is obvious.<p>


	

<li>	Men have their own sexual and reproductive health needs and often these are not met. For example, men need knowledge of their own and their partner's sexuality; information about and treatment for the causes of infertility; information about the prevention of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV infection; understanding about sharing decision making on reproduction with partners; and diagnosis and treatment of prostate diseases.<p>


	

<li>	Men are often more supportive of family planning than is generally thought. Recent Demographic and Health Surveys indicate that in most countries men's approval of family planning matches that of women.  However, women are often unaware of partners' positive attitudes, and so do not discuss the issue.<p>


	

<li>	About one-third of couples in developing countries use male contraceptive methods, or methods that require male cooperation. Yet only a small fraction of programme efforts is usually directed towards men.<p>


	

<li>	Reproductive health initiatives are generally more effective if there is better communication between spouses. Experiences from the field clearly show that educational programmes aimed at improving spousal communication are associated with better contraceptive use.<p>



<li>	Serious reproductive health problems, including transmission of STDs, adolescent pregnancy and unsafe abortion are often caused by a complete lack of knowledge and a poor sense of responsibility among male adolescents. These problems can be solved only if young men are effectively included in information, education and communication activities and if sexual and reproductive health services are made accessible to young men.</ul><p>




One objective of male involvement programmes has been to increase male acceptance of family planning, and has targeted three categories of people: the general population (in order to create a generally favourable social climate for male participation); political, religious and other male leaders (to create community support for male participation); men as partners (to reduce or remove their opposition to their wives adopting family planning). <p>




A second objective has been to increase the use of male contraceptive methods, and programmes here have centred on vasectomy, with a more recent additional emphasis, since the advent of HIV/AIDS, on condom use. Two further objectives have been to improve spousal communication on family planning and related subjects; and to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of men. <p>




Some projects have been based on a combination of all four objectives. The male motivation programme carried out by the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council between 1987 and 1991 is a good example of this.  Meeting the first two objectives dominated programmes started in the 1980s, while improving spousal communication has been given more emphasis in current programmes.  Identifying and responding to the needs of men has only just begun. <p>




There were, however, some early initiatives in which special services for men were offered: the Brazilian PRO-PATER clinic and the men's clinics of the Colombian FPA, Profamilia, are the most outstanding examples. Activities for men usually require completely new structures; unlike women, men cannot be reached through existing maternal and child health facilities. <p>




Male involvement initiatives so far have tended to use one of the following approaches.<p>

<ul>
 

<li>	Mass media campaigns, using the written press, radio and television. These campaigns are often supported by a variety of materials, such as leaflets, T-shirts, plastic bags, etc. Notable examples are the vasectomy promotion campaigns by PRO-PATER in Brazil during the 1980s, the Los Tromés campaign launched in Peru in 1992 which aims at encouraging communication between young couples, a national male motivation campaign in Bolivia started in 1994, and the Zimbabwe programme already mentioned. <p>


	

<li>	Providing information to men at their workplaces and, where health services are available, sometimes family planning services too. This approach has been extensively implemented in Africa, with examples in The Gambia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and recently in Mauritius.  Workplaces include army barracks, police offices, the government, industrial centres, training institutes and bars and hotels.<p>


	

<li>	Community outreach to men has taken a variety of approaches, with direct contact between fieldworkers and men in the community the common denominator. Activities include formal and informal discussions, home visits, film and video shows, puppet shows, games, and also condom distribution and referral to clinics. Good examples of this approach are found in Mardan in the north-west of Pakistan, in Mali's Katibougou project, in Swaziland's roadshows which include condom promotion games, and in Kenya, where puppet shows aim to motivate men on family planning and STD prevention. Another interesting example is a project of the Nigerian FPA in which traditional healers are trained to promote the use of non-prescriptive contraceptive methods.
<p>

	

<li>	Motivating and gaining the support of male community leaders. Men are influenced by the opinions of community leaders, particularly religious leaders, so this is an important approach, mostly undertaken through organizing seminars, training courses and informal meetings. The FPA of Bangladesh has worked with religious leaders for a long time, and a comparable project has been implemented in the Minya province in Egypt, where Muslim and Christian religious leaders were trained in family planning and community mobilization skills. Subsequently, these leaders conducted meetings with men in villages. A different example is found in Tanzania, where the family planning association (UMATI) has worked extensively with political leaders at national and local levels, and with members of parliament, since the early 1980s.</ul><p>




The current growing interest in programmes directed towards men can be interpreted as a response to the need to balance the strong concentration on women's reproductive health during the past decade. The reality remains, however, that women carry a far greater burden of reproductive morbidity and mortality, and of the physical and social responsibility for fertility and its consequences, than men. Reproductive health initiatives directed towards men therefore should not just concentrate on benefits for men themselves, but also on the needs of women. <p>




At the same time, experience suggests that it is often neither realistic nor very effective to approach men as just irresponsible, uncaring and uninterested. Men should be approached as responsible partners. They also have their own particular needs, such as sexual education for young men, education and services promoting safer sex practices, sharing responsibility for child care, and counselling and treatment for sexual problems, dysfunctions and diseases.<p>




Pointers for the future include the need for information programmes that portray men as caring husbands and fathers, and that stress the benefits of shared family responsibility for both men and women; a need to improve the image of male contraceptives and of male contraceptive use; sexual health education and special services for adolescent men; special clinic hours for men and creation of an atmosphere in clinics that appeals to men; and more research into men's special sexual and reproductive health needs.<p>

	Irish Aid - 20 Questions	

</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<CENTER><H3><p>IRISH AID : 20 QUESTIONS</h3>

Vist the Main Irish Aid Web Site: <A HREF="http://www.irlgov.ie/iveagh/foreignaffairs/default.htm#c"  target="_top">http://www.irlgov.ie/iveagh/foreignaffairs/default.htm#c</a></CENTER>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<BR>

<B>1.	WHAT IS IRISH AID?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid is the Irish Government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) Programme. It provides long-term support and emergency relief to developing countries, particularly in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa.<B> </B>It is administered according to principles laid down in &quot;<A HREF="http://www.irlgov.ie/iveagh/foreignaffairs/irishaid/strategy/index.html"  target="_top">Irish Aid: Consolidation and Growth: A Strategy Plan</A>&quot;, published by the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1993.<BR>

<BR>

<B>2.	WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF IRISH AID?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid is designed to alleviate poverty and meet the basic needs of people in some of the world's poorest countries. It works in partnership with the people and governments of these countries to help them to control their own economic and social development. <BR>

<BR>

<B>3.	WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS ARE UNDERTAKEN?</B><BR>

<BR>

Projects are undertaken in such areas as primary health care, education, sanitation, rural development and capacity building (the establishment of government structures which can carry on the work). There is a strong emphasis on training local people who can then continue with the projects after Irish Aid assistance has been phased out.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.	WHO IS IN CHARGE OF IRISH AID?</B><BR>

<BR>

Ms Joan Burton, T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, has special responsibility for Irish Aid.<BR>

<BR>

<B>5.	HOW LARGE IS THE IRISH AID BUDGET?</B><BR>

<BR>

The budget for 1996 is a record £106 million. The figures for 1993, 1994 and 1995 were £55 million, £70 million and £89 million, respectively. All funding is given in the form of grants. As no loans are given, no debt is created.At a time when many other countries are cutting their overseas aid budgets, the Irish Government is committed to increasing the Irish Aid budget towards a UN-recommended level of 0.7% GNP. <BR>

<BR>

<B>6.	HOW IS IRISH AID ADMINISTERED?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid is administered through the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin, which maintains diplomatic missions in five of the most important recipient countries of Irish Aid. Funds are distributed in the forms of bilateral and multilateral aid.<BR>

<BR>

<B>7.	WHAT IS BILATERAL AID?</B><BR>

<BR>

Bilateral aid is given directly by the Irish Government - or is sometimes given through Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs) - to projects in developing countries. These projects have been carefully assessed and are being thoroughly monitored. Most are in priority countries.<BR>

<BR>

<B>8.	WHAT ARE PRIORITY COUNTRIES?</B><BR>

<BR>

Because there are so many parts of the world in need of assistance, each donor country selects particular priority countries to receive the bulk of its aid. Ireland's priority countries, for which one of the main selection criteria is low GNP, are: Ethiopia, Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.<BR>

<BR>

<B>9.	WHAT IS MULTILATERAL AID?</B><BR>

<BR>

Multilateral aid is channelled through international organisations, such as the United Nations.<BR>

<BR>

<B>10.	WHAT ROLE DOES IRISH AID PLAY IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY?</B><BR>

<BR>

Ireland is involved in the decision-making processes of the European Union (EU) and of the United Nations (UN), in relation to overseas development. Some 38% of the 1995 Irish Aid budget is being invested in large-scale, multilateral aid projects financed by the EU and various UN organisations.<BR>

										<BR>

<B>11.	WHAT IS IRISH AID'S ROLE IN RELATION TO REFUGEES?</B><BR>

<BR>

There are about 1000 refugees in Ireland, most of whom are from Vietnam or Bosnia. An additional 250 Bosnian refugees, together with family members, are due to arrive before mid- 1996. Irish Aid is responsible for the travel arrangements of refugees and works in close cooperation with the Refugee Agency, a body established by the Government in 1991, under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.<BR>

<BR>

A new Refugee Bill has been introduced (6 October 1995) which aims to place Ireland at the forefront of progressive international law and practice in relation to asylum seekers.<BR>

<BR>

<B>12.	WHAT IS EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN RELIEF?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid allocates a certain percentage of its budget to emergency humanitarian assistance, to help countries that are experiencing catastrophes in the form of natural disasters, famine, war or civil strife (eg, Rwanda, Somalia and former Yugoslavia). <BR>

<BR>

Emergency aid is channelled through NGOs such as Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, Goal, Christian Aid, Gorta, Irish Red Cross and through various international agencies such as UNICEF and UNHCR.<BR>

<BR>

<B>13.	WHAT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN IRISH AID AND NGOs?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid works in close cooperation with NGOs for both bilateral and multilateral aid programmes. One special feature is the NGO Co-Financing Scheme, whereby Irish Aid pays up to 75% of the cost of particular NGO projects. This scheme is not restricted to large NGOs and small missionary orders and other organisations may also apply.<BR>

<BR>

<B>14.	WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN IRISH AID AND APSO?</B><BR>

<BR>

APSO (Agency for Personal Services Overseas) is a state sponsored body, set up in 1974. It enables Irish people to share their skills and knowledge with people in the developing world. APSO receives a grant-in-aid from the Department of Foreign Affairs.<BR>

<BR>

<B>15.	WHAT STANCE DOES IRISH AID TAKE ON HUMAN RIGHTS?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid supports human rights and democratisation. It encourages the development of institutions and mechanisms that empower people, especially the poor or those who are victims of discrimination.<BR>

<BR>

<B>16.	WHAT STANCE DOES IRISH AID TAKE ON GENDER ISSUES?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid is committed to gender equality in all areas of development. It particularly encourages projects that offer education and training for women which will allow them to participate fully in all aspects of decision-making.<BR>

<BR>

<B>17.	HOW ARE IRISH AID PROJECTS ASSESSED?</B><BR>

<BR>

All projects submitted to Irish Aid are assessed at local level, at Departmental level and by the Audit and Evaluation Unit. This body comprises a panel of experts from a number of areas (including auditing, health, education and rural development), each of whom has experience of working in overseas development.<BR>

<BR>

<B>18.	WHY HAS IRISH AID INTRODUCED A NEW AWARENESS PROGRAMME?</B><BR>

<BR>

Irish Aid has recently appointed an Information Officer to publicise its activities. As the aid programme expands, it is important to keep the public informed of the aims, objectives and activities of Irish Aid. Part of the Information Officer's brief is to give the public a sense of ownership of the Programme.<BR>

<BR>

A brochure about Irish Aid has recently been published and a series of fact-sheets is being prepared. Each fact-sheet will describe a different aspect of Irish Aid's activities. The first of these fact-sheets will be available in the spring of 1996. <BR>

<BR>

<B>19.	WHAT IS THE <A HREF="../iaac/iaac.htm">IRISH AID ADVISORY COMMITTEE</a>?</B><BR>

<BR>

The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) was set up in November 1993, as part of the Government's Strategy Plan for Irish Aid. The functions of the 14-member Committee are to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs on matters relating to: development cooperation; policy aspects of Ireland's aid programme; and the operation, consolidation and expansion of the Irish Aid programme.<BR>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Spanish Development Cooperation</h3>



Spanish development assistance is closely related to historical and linguistic relations and cultural activities

in Latin America, as well as to Spanish commercial interests, and to geographic proximity and migratory

pressures from Northern Africa. Official Spanish development cooperation started in 1985, when the first

aid programme was initiated. NGO development activities date back to the 1950s and even the 1940s. In

1983 Spain was removed from the DAC list of developing countries. The country became a member of

DAC in December 1991. The public is concerned with domestic problems of high unemployment, economic

recession, immigration, and racism. However, in a recent opinion poll 65 per cent of the public declared

itself in favour of raising the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of GNP, a target requested by a Parliamentary

report in 1992. Parliamentary support for development cooperation is quite strong, in contrast to the actual

measures taken by the Government.

<p>

Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 1 518 million, corresponding with 0.26 per cent

of GNP, after a period of decline in the 1980s. Forecasts for 1993 and 1994 are around 0.24 per cent of

GNP. After a considerable rise in multilateral contributions, they fell to 0.25 in 1992. The greater part, 0.20

per cent of total ODA, went to the EU budget and the EDF. The EU-share was the second most important

component of ODA in 1992, after the concessional official export credits through the FAD (Fondo de

Ayuda al Desarrollo), which reached 56 percent of ODA in 1992.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Spanish development cooperation still lacks a unified development concept, a centralised aid budget and the

corresponding administrative structures. Government development cooperation structures are relatively

young and their staff has limited experience. 

<p>

A law establishing a legislative basis for development cooperation, will probably be voted by Parliament

during 1994. Until now development cooperation is based on ad hoc administrative rules, although already

in 1984 the Senate approved a motion on international cooperation.

<p>

There is no Minister for Development Cooperation. The administration of Spanish aid is spread over a

dozen ministries, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECI, established 1988) and the

Institute for Official Credits (ICO). Each ministry has a separate aid budget. Autonomous regions and some

municipalities also have their own aid programmes, mostly implemented by NGOs. The Ministry for

Foreign Affairs (MFA) has a State Secretariat for International Cooperation and Latin America (SECIPI,

established 1985). It is responsible for the programming, control and evaluation of the aid programme of the

MFA, and it is in charge of the coordination of the aid activities by other ministries. Its role is nonetheless

rather limited, since it administers only a small share of the aid programme (10 per cent of ODA including

AECI's share in 1992, otherwise 2 per cent).

<p>

The largest share of reported Spanish ODA falls under the responsibility of the State Secretariat of Trade of

the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism (MCT). It deals with FAD's extensive loan programme which is

administered by the Institute for Official Credits, and with the contributions to international financing

institutions. Other multilateral contributions are mainly handled by the Ministry of Economy and Finance

(MEF).

<p>

The bilateral technical cooperation programme is designed and carried out by the Agency AECI directly, or

subcontracted to others. AECI is managed by a Governing Council and an Executive Committee. It receives

its funds from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to which it is attached through SECIPI. AECI is organised

along geographical lines in three institutes, that can be compared with directorates-general: the Institute for

Iberian American Cooperation (ICI), responsible for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Institute for

Cooperation with Arab Countries (ICMA), in charge of cooperation with Arab countries and other countries

in the Middle East and North Africa, and the Institute for Development Cooperation (ICD), which covers

sub-Saharan Africa (mainly Portuguese speaking countries in Africa) and Asia. The ICD and the ICMA are

bound to merge in a current administrative reorganisation. Compared with 1989 AECI's budget for 1994 is

reduced by half.

<p>

The most important other ministries involved include Labour and Social Security, Education and Science,

Health, and Social Affairs.

<p>

To coordinate the various aid activities an Interministerial Commission for International Cooperation (CICI)

was established in 1986, chaired by the Foreign Minister, in which fourteen ministries are represented. The

CICI used to meet twice a year. In order to strengthen the role of the Commission, the number of meetings

has been increased, following the 1992 Parliamentary recommendations. CICI discusses the Annual Plan for

Development Cooperation (PACI), the inventory of activities and programmes for development cooperation

(not allocations or budgets) of all ministries involved. PACI is prepared by SECIPI's Planning and

Evaluation Office (OPE). These plans, after an elaborate procedure, are submitted for approval to the

Council of Ministers.

<p>

After preparation in various departments of the MCT, FAD credits are submitted to the Interministerial

FAD Commission (CIFAD), which meets about six times a year. Final approval is given by the Council of

Ministers. The Commission, chaired by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism, is composed of senior

officials from several ministries, including MFA/SECIPI, Economy and Finance, Public Works and

Transport, Agriculture and Fisheries, Industry and Energy, and the Bank of Spain.

<p>

The Parliamentary report of 1992 envisages to strengthen the coordination of the various instruments of

Spanish aid. Although the MFA, SECIPI, and the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism are represented

already on both the CICI and the FAD Commission, and although recommendations of both commissions

need the approval of the Council of Ministers, coordination might be improved. 

<p>

Many internal consultation mechanisms do exist for day-to-day policy implementation. AECI's president is

in charge of the Emergency Aid Group, by which SECIPI coordinates emergency programmes. Members of

the Group are the Ministries of MFA, of Defense, of the Interior, and Health and Consumption, the Cruz

Roja, UNICEF, Caritas, and IBERIA. Supporting the conclusions of the 1992 Parliamentary Report, the

Government has taken steps to improve the use of the PACI as a planning instrument, to strengthen the role

of the CICI. In addition the CICI approved guidelines for Spanish development cooperation in February

1994, to be operational in 1995.

<p>

The annual budget plan PACI is published. SECIPI has an evaluation office OPE, and MCT has its own

evaluation system for FAD (mainly directed towards the verification of the proper use of funds). Evaluations

are not published. Planning, monitoring and evaluation procedures are to be revised and evaluation

frequencies stepped up. The State Secretariat of Commerce issues a magazine about Spanish development

cooperation, 'Informaci&#243;n Commercial Espa&#241;ola'.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

There is no formal advisory structure in Spain. However, the Government considers the establishment of a

Consultative Council for Development Cooperation which would be composed of representatives of NGOs,

universities, trade unions, and industries. It would create a discussion platform on development cooperation

with relevant groups in Spanish society. From the side of the NGOs this plan is favoured by the

Coordinadora, a platform in which 70 NGOs are assembled.

<p>

The members of Parliament and the Foreign Affairs Committee of both houses of Parliament are well aware

of the problems in developing countries, of the Spanish administration's need for change, and they are

actively engaged in discussing the strengthening of the Spanish aid performance. Annually the Secretary of

State for Cooperation presents the Plan for Development Cooperation to the Foreign Affairs Commission.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

There are about 200 Spanish NGOs active in the field of development assistance. They have their origins in

the Church, in professional organisations, in political and solidarity committees, and in trade unions. Some

of them raise a considerable amount of money from the public, far exceeding the amount received from the

Government. Spanish ODA channelled through NGOs has increased somewhat in the last years, but fell in

1992 to 2 per cent of total ODA. Funds are allocated on a project-by-project base, through annual

competitive bidding and a rather elaborate procedure. Half a dozen larger, experienced organisations receive

more than half of the official support. Most NGO activities are located in Latin America.

<p>

The NGOs, regrouped in a single platform, Coordinadora, with 70 members, want to be more involved in

policy discussions with the Government and in decision making. They are pleading for larger government

support, and for effective procedures and greater openness on official aid activities, in particular on FAD

credits. The Government intends to expand the cooperation with NGOs.

<p>

Trade unions recently have become more active in the field of development cooperation. The two largest

unions decided to set aside 0.7 per cent of the membership fees (one), or of all trade union income (the

other); they started awareness raising campaigns.

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey, 16 institutes in Spain qualify as Development Research and

Training Institutes. Some are involved in government development policy debates, studies or consultancy

work. Generally, government institutions are only allowed to contract outside consultants for a one time

period of 3 - 4 years.

Zwaartepuntvorming in het Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek Inzake Ontwikkelingssamenwerking

<P>door <I>Kristien Verbrugghen</I>

</h2>

<h4>(Tekst van een artikel verschenen in <I>Universiteit & Beleid</I>, vol. 10, no. 1, 1995: pp. 40-44

<p></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

<H4>1. Situering</H4>

<P>

In de zomer van 1995 werden de Vlaamse universiteiten alsook de IODEWE (Interuniversitaire Overlegstructuur Derde Wereld) door het VL.I.R.-secretariaat verzocht om voorstellen van thema's voor het beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking (BVO) 1996 bij het VL.I.R.-secretariaat in te dienen. Deze voorstellen zouden dan als input worden gebruikt om een interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te helpen concipi&#235;ren. 

<P>

De visie van de VL.I.R. op onderzoek dat gericht is op de voorbereiding van het overheidsbeleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking kan alsvolgt worden samengevat :

<P>	

<UL>

<LI>met dit onderzoek moet ingespeeld kunnen worden op beleidsvragen van de overheid;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>teneinde op de vragen van de overheid te kunnen inspelen, moet het BVO dat aan de universiteiten wordt uitgevoerd, versterkt worden;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>dit onderzoek moet van internationaal niveau zijn, i.e. van dermate kwaliteit dat het internationaal meespeelt. Dit veronderstelt zwaartepuntvorming aansluitend bij bestaand onderzoek en de eigen inspanningen van de universiteiten waarbij dit zwaartepuntonderzoek moet kunnen rekenen op voldoende sterke en continue financi&#235;le ondersteuning. Een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming sluit echter geenszins vernieuwing uit;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>het BVO vormt op Vlaams niveau best een geco&#246;rdineerd geheel, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met het zwaartepuntonderzoek in Franstalig Belgi&#235; en internationaal. Vanzelfsprekend wordt interuniversitaire samenwerking rond zwaartepunten aanbevolen;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>het BVO moet tevens de belangstelling voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking in de universiteiten z&#233;lf levendig houden. Daarom dient het best te berusten op onderzoekskernen in verschillende universiteiten.

</UL>

De VL.I.R.-Werkgroep "Ontwikkelingssamenwerking", die zich moest beraden over het antwoord op de vraag rond welke thema's de Vlaamse universiteiten de komende jaren zwaartepuntonderzoek in het BVO wensen uit te bouwen, had zich in eerste instantie akkoord verklaard met de volgende vijf algemene thema's :

<P>

 

<OL>

<LI>armoedebestrijding,

<LI>politieke, juridische en culturele dimensie van ontwikkeling,

<LI>economische dimensie van ontwikkeling,

<LI>duurzame ontwikkeling, en 

<LI>onderwijs, opleiding en onderzoek.

</OL> 

De Werkgroep ging er bovendien vanuit dat het de bedoeling moet zijn bij het concipi&#235;ren van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming elk algemeen thema te verfijnen naar &#233;&#233;n of maximum twee subthema's, wat een selectie van subthema's impliceerde. De Werkgroep oordeelde dat het antwoord op de vraag rond welke thema's zwaartepuntonderzoek dient te worden uitgebouwd, ondermeer samenhangt met het Vlaams, universitair ontwikkelingsrelevant onderzoekspotentieel, alsook met het beleid dat de Vlaamse universiteiten m.b.t. het BVO willen voeren en de eigen inspanningen die zij ervoor willen leveren. Tenslotte dient ook rekening te worden gehouden enerzijds met het zwaartepuntonderzoek dat elders rond ontwikkelingssamenwerking wordt bedreven, ondermeer door de Franstalige universiteiten, en anderzijds met de internationale agenda's en de actualiteit. De criteria voor de selectie van subthema's werden derhalve afgestemd op deze vooronderstelling : er werd gekeken naar het bestaande universitair onderzoekspotentieel m.b.t. deze subthema's (i.e. de onderzoekservaring terzake en de bestaffing van de onderzoekseenheid die zich met dergelijk ontwikkelingsrelevant onderzoek inlaat), naar de bereidheid van de universiteit om dit onderzoek ook via eigen middelen te ondersteunen, en naar de relevantie van het subthema binnen het geheel van het BVO. 

<P>	

<H4>2. Geselecteerde thema's m.b.t. zwaartepuntonderzoek in het BVO</H4>

<P>

Op 20 oktober jl. keurde de VL.I.R.-Werkgroep "Ontwikkelingssamenwerking" het voorstel goed dat door het VL.I.R.-secretariaat was uitgewerkt op basis van de universitaire voorstellen, de informeel door het ABOS voorgestelde thema's voor BVO 1996, de door Staatssecretaris R. MOREELS als prioritair aangekaarte thema's in zijn beleidsnota, de ABOS-referentietermen voor de BVO 1995-thema's en de BVO 1995-thema's van CIUF.

<P>

Hieronder wordt het voorstel integraal weergegeven.

<P>

<HR>

<P>

<center><H4>Voorstel m.b.t. thema's voor zwaartepuntonderzoek in het kader van BVO<BR>

	(Oktober 1995)</H4></center>

<P>

<H4>1. Armoedebestrijding</H4>

<P>

<I>Algemeen</I>

<P>

Armoedebestrijding staat opnieuw vrij hoog geplaatst op de internationale ontwikkelingsagenda (cfr. Sociale Top van Kopenhagen, maart 1995), zo ook op de nationale agenda, gelet op de recente uitspraken van Staatssecretaris R. MOREELS. Het is evenwel niet vanzelfsprekend om deze centrale doelstelling te integreren en te operationaliseren in de werking van het ABOS. De effici&#235;ntie en effectiviteit van armoedebestrijdingsprojecten op micro-niveau worden immers in grote mate geconditioneerd door de macro-beleidscontext. In dit verband dient verwezen naar de globale macro-economische context van de mondialisering van de economie als structuur wijzigende context van ontwikkelingssamenwerking, alsook concreet naar de structurele aanpassingsprogramma's en andere economische stabilisatie- en hervormingsprogramma's die worden opgelegd door het IMF, de Wereldbank en andere multilaterale donoren en kredietverstrekkers. Maatregelen in het kader van dergelijke hervormingsprogramma's hebben vaak een aanzienlijke impact op projecten van bilaterale donoren. De koppeling van macro-economische ontwikkeling aan de armoedeproblematiek is essentieel voor een evenwichtig ontwikkelingsproces. 

<P>

Uitgangspunt voor de concrete uitwerking van dit algemeen thema vormt de vraag naar de effecten van ontwikkelingsprojecten op de spreiding van de voordelen van ontwikkeling en ontwikkelingssamenwerking onder de verschillende groepen in de lokale samenleving, waarbij bijzondere aandacht dient uit te gaan naar de spreiding van deze voordelen onder de armste groepen van die samenleving. Indien donoren op een coherente wijze een beleid van armoedebestrijding willen voeren, dan hebben zij een instrument nodig dat hen toelaat de situatie in het hulpontvangend land correct te beoordelen, koppelingsmechanismen in werking te stellen en de effici&#235;ntie ervan te evalueren, teneinde hun beleid bij te sturen indien en waar nodig.  

<P>

Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema. 

<P>

<I>Specifieke subthema's </I>

<P>

1. Bijdragen van donoren tot de ontwikkeling van een sociale economie in de gegeven macro-economische context. Specifieke aandachtspunten vormen :

<UL>

<LI>werkgelegenheid, inkomensverdeling en werkloosheid;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>de rol van multilaterale donoren, publieke overheden en NGO's bij de uitvoering en het beheer van projecten in het licht van armoedebestrijding.

</UL>

2. De organisatie en ontwikkeling van basisgezondheidszorg.

<P>

<H4>2. Politieke, juridische en culturele dimensie van ontwikkeling </H4>

<P>

<I>Algemeen</I>

<P>

Het betreft onderzoek naar de politiek-juridische dimensie van ontwikkeling, inzonderheid in de Afrikaanse context, met daarbij ruime aandacht voor culturele tradities. Toch gaat het hierbij niet uitsluitend om formele structuren. In verschillende landen wordt het effect van ontwikkelingssamenwerking doorkruist en vaak tenietgedaan door conflicten langs etnoculturele breuklijnen. Hoe hierop praktisch het best ingespeeld wordt via ontwikkelingssamenwerking, dient te worden onderzocht. Er moet voorts worden nagegaan hoe, in geval van conflicten in het algemeen, de overgang van noodhulp naar permanente ontwikkeling best dient te worden georganiseerd. Voorts dient ook aandacht te worden besteed aan de ontwikkeling van een civiele maatschappij.

<P>

Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema. 

<P>

<I>Specifieke subthema's </I>

<P>

1. Politieke stabiliteit : conflictpreventie en -beheersing, en de rol van ontwikkelingssamenwerking hierin

2. Democratisering : 

<UL>

<LI>de opbouw van de civiele maatschappij, o.m. door de ontwikkeling en versterking van cultureel ingebedde plurale rechtssystemen, met daarbij aandacht voor de rechtszekerheid

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>lokale bestuursvormen, goed bestuur en decentralisatie.

</UL>

<H4>3. Economische dimensie van ontwikkeling</H4>

<P>

<I>Algemeen</I>

<P>

De mondialisering van de economie heeft de context van ontwikkelingssamenwerking grondig gewijzigd. Afrika bleef tot nog toe evenwel in grote mate verstoken van een participatie in de internationale groeidynamiek die vele andere ontwikkelingslanden (e.g. in Zuidoost-Azi&#235; en Latijns-Amerika) de afgelopen jaren kenden. Een van de grote uitdagingen voor een ontwikkelingsbeleid bestaat er derhalve in om de economische ontwikkelingskansen voor de Afrikaanse landen te maximaliseren in deze internationale context. Sinds kort hebben experten en internationale organisaties erkend dat ontwikkeling zonder een valorisatie van de rol van het bedrijfsleven weinig uitzicht biedt om echt duurzaam te zijn. Het BVO-onderzoek rond dit globaal thema zou zich concentreren op de voorwaarden voor een economische groei- en ontwikkelingsdynamiek. Hierbij zal in het bijzonder aandacht worden besteed aan het entrepreneurship in ontwikkelingslanden. 

<P>

Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema.

<P>

<I>Specifiek subthema </I>

<P>

Entrepreneurship in ontwikkelingslanden : impact van buitenlandse directe investeringen bij transfert en diffusie van technologie in de lokale economie; groeiremmende factoren bij de ontwikkeling van industri&#235;le ondernemingen in Afrika; internationalisering en privatisering; rol van ontwikkelingssamenwerking bij deze ontwikkelingen.

<P>

<H4>4. Duurzame ontwikkeling</H4>

<P>

<I>Algemeen</I>

<P>

Het betreft onderzoek naar duurzame ontwikkeling in de context van de ontwikkelingsproblematiek en het opvolgen van de internationale agenda terzake, alsook onderzoek naar de beleidsimplicaties hiervan voor de Belgische ontwikkelingssamenwerking.

<P>

Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema.

<P>

<I>Specifieke subthema's</I>

<P>

1. Verstedelijking en duurzame ontwikkeling : knelpunten inzake de implementatie van Agenda 21 in het Belgisch ontwikkelingsbeleid, met nadruk op stedelijke planning, woonzekerheid, decentralisatie en milieudraagkracht in middelgrote steden in onwikkelingslanden.

2. Capaciteitsopbouw inzake leefmilieu zowel in de ontwikkelingslanden als in het ABOS.

<P>

<H4>5. Onderwijs, opleiding en onderzoek </H4>

<P>

<I>Algemeen</I>

<P>

Uitgangspunt vormt de vraag hoe in de derde wereld, en in Afrika in het bijzonder, enerzijds het onderwijs in zijn verschillende vormen en op de verschillende niveaus, en onderzoek en ontwikkeling/technologie anderzijds een lokale ontwikkelingsdynamiek kunnen ondersteunen. Meer in het bijzonder zal worden nagegaan op welke wijze ontwikkelingssamenwerking kan bijdragen tot een grotere socio-economische en culturele verankering van onderwijs en onderzoek, dit zowel wat betreft organisatiemodellen, onderwijsinhouden als pedagogische en onderzoeksmethodologie&#235;n.	

<P>

Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema. 

<P>

<I>Specifieke subthema's</I>

<P>

1. Integratie van het basisonderwijs in de socio-economische realiteit van ontwikkelingslanden

2. Onderzoek en ontwikkeling/technologie als factor in het ontwikkelingsproces van derde-wereldlanden, met daarbij bijzondere aandacht voor de opleiding van het lokaal onderwijzend personeel en voor de bijdrage van de universiteiten tot de invulling van de onderzoekscomponent van de lokale universiteiten

<P>

<H4>3. Voorbereiding BVO 1996</H4>

<P>

Dit voorstel van de Vlaamse universiteiten zal, tezamen met de voorstellen van thema's resp. van het Kabinet voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking en het ABOS, worden besproken door de Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek" tijdens haar volgende vergadering op 13 november 1995. In deze Stuurgroep zijn zowel de universiteiten als het Kabinet voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking en het ABOS vertegenwoordigd. De Stuurgroep zal uit de drie lijsten een selectie van thema's maken en deze aan de Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking voorstellen als prioritaire thema's voor BVO 1996. Eens de Staatssecretaris de lijst van thema's definitief heeft goedgekeurd, zal de oproep aan de universiteiten tot het indienen van voorstellen worden gelanceerd. Indien het overleg in de schoot van de Stuurgroep vlot verloopt, moet het mogelijk zijn de oproep te lanceren nog vóór het einde van het jaar.

<P>

<H3>La gestion de Lom&eacute;: une mission impossible?</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171;Cela vaut-il toujours la peine de passer par toutes ces proc&eacute;dures lentes et pesantes?&#187; (un ordonnateur national ACP).</I>

<P>

Sur le papier, la Convention de Lom&eacute; est peut-&ecirc;tre l'instrument de coop&eacute;ration Nord-Sud le plus sophistiqu&eacute; et le plus complet qui soit et la flexibilit&eacute; de la structure de Lom&eacute; a peut-&ecirc;tre permis l'adoption d'approches innovatrices et la mise en oeuvre r&eacute;ussie de programmes dans de nombreux pays ACP. Cependant, la r&eacute;alit&eacute; n'est pas toujours aussi brillante au niveau op&eacute;rationnel. Les praticiens de part et d'autre sont d&eacute;&ccedil;us. Ils voient se creuser le foss&eacute; s&eacute;parant les grandes ambitions de la Convention et les r&eacute;alisations modestes sur le terrain. Ils doivent travailler avec une Convention toujours plus complexe, dont les conditions et proc&eacute;dures de gestion ont &eacute;t&eacute; qualifi&eacute;es de &#171;cauchemar&#187;.

<P>

Les mauvais signes sont manifestes. De grosses sommes d'argent ne sont pas d&eacute;pens&eacute;es. On observe en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral un important d&eacute;calage entre les &#171;engagements&#187; et les &#171;d&eacute;boursements&#187;, une tendance que l'on peut m&ecirc;me remarquer dans des pays dot&eacute;s de niveaux de capacit&eacute;s administratives suffisants. De grands retards surviennent dans diverses parties du syst&egrave;me (dans la programmation, les appels d'offres  et l'ex&eacute;cution). La bureaucratisation s&eacute;vit. Plusieurs instruments demeurent en grande partie inconnus et, par cons&eacute;quent, insuffisamment utilis&eacute;s (c'est le cas, par exemple, de la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e). La d&eacute;motivation &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de Lom&eacute; est une r&eacute;alit&eacute; dans les administrations ACP et dans les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations de l'UE.

<P>

Le message est clair: les d&eacute;bats sur l'avenir des relations ACP-UE ne devraient pas se limiter aux &#171;grandes questions&#187;, mais devraient aussi repenser la mani&egrave;re dont l'aide est mise en oeuvre et dont les nombreux volets techniques sont g&eacute;r&eacute;s. De nombreuses questions doivent &ecirc;tre abord&eacute;es. Comment peut-on concevoir un accord de coop&eacute;ration plus facile &agrave; utiliser? Quels instruments de l'actuelle Convention doit-on conserver? Comment peut-on accro&icirc;tre la coh&eacute;rence entre les diff&eacute;rents instruments? La programmation est-elle encore un exercice utile? Devrait-on maintenir le syst&egrave;me de la &#171;cogestion&#187;? Des approches de gestion sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; chaque pays sont-elles n&eacute;cessaires?

<P>

<H3>Consensus sur les principaux goulots d'&eacute;tranglement</H3>

<P>

Il y a peu de d&eacute;saccords en ce qui concerne les principaux probl&egrave;mes de gestion qui font obstacle &agrave; une mise en oeuvre efficace de la coop&eacute;ration technique et financi&egrave;re:

<P>

<LI><I>Distension de la Convention</I>. Au cours des ans, la port&eacute;e de la Convention de Lom&eacute; s'est consid&eacute;rablement &eacute;tendue. Elle a doubl&eacute; de volume avec l'addition de nouveaux principes et de nouveaux objectifs, refl&eacute;tant l'&eacute;volution de la mode dans la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement, par exemple, l'attention accord&eacute;e &agrave; l'environnement ou au r&#244;le des femmes dans le d&eacute;veloppement. Cette distension ne refl&eacute;tait cependant pas une strat&eacute;gie de d&eacute;veloppement logique, pas plus qu'elle ne concordait avec les capacit&eacute;s de gestion tant au niveau des ACP qu'&agrave; celui de l'UE. &#171;L'assimilation&#187; de Lom&eacute; constitue un probl&egrave;me insoluble pour de nombreux pays ACP. Ils ont tendance &agrave; d&eacute;pendre de plus en plus de conseillers techniques (ch&egrave;rement r&eacute;mun&eacute;r&eacute;s) de l'UE travaillant directement pour le gouvernement ACP, avec le risque imminent d'une faible appropriation.

<P>

<LI><I>Concentration sur les instruments au d&eacute;triment de la strat&eacute;gie</I>. La premi&egrave;re Convention de Lom&eacute; a gagn&eacute; l'imagination des individus avec son grand &eacute;ventail d'instruments (innovateurs). Les ren&eacute;gociations successives portaient principalement sur les instruments (am&eacute;lioration de l'application des dispositions commerciales, r&eacute;vision des proc&eacute;dures, cr&eacute;ation de nouvelles facilit&eacute;s). Par contraste, on a accord&eacute; tr&egrave;s peu d'attention au d&eacute;bat plus fondamental sur les strat&eacute;gies. Cela s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; une recette de mauvaise aide au d&eacute;veloppement. Les r&eacute;sultats assez faibles d'instruments tels que le STABEX et les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales l'illustrent bien. Les instruments sont des moyens de parvenir &agrave; des fins et non pas des fins en soi.

<P>

<LI><I>Prolif&eacute;ration de syst&egrave;mes</I>. Avec chaque n&eacute;gociation, la gamme d'instruments et de syst&egrave;mes financiers s'est &eacute;largie. Dans un m&ecirc;me pays, la panoplie Lom&eacute; peut comporter un programme indicatif national, un programme indicatif r&eacute;gional, des financements selon le STABEX, le SYSMIN et la facilit&eacute; d'ajustement structurel, une s&eacute;rie de petits plans (coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, micro-projets) et, parfois, de l'aide alimentaire, de l'aide aux r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s et aux sinistr&eacute;s. Pour certains, il est maintenant impossible d'utiliser une telle panoplie d'instruments de mani&egrave;re coh&eacute;rente.

<P>

<LI><I>Responsabilit&eacute;s de gestion mal d&eacute;finies</I>. Aux termes du &#171;partenariat &eacute;gal&#187; de la Convention de Lom&eacute;, les responsabilit&eacute;s sont &#171;partag&eacute;es&#187;. Dans la pratique, cela pose souvent des difficult&eacute;s de savoir qui est responsable de quoi. De part et d'autre, le syst&egrave;me de &#171;cogestion&#187; b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie aujourd'hui de tr&egrave;s peu d'appui. Il est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme une cause majeure de retards dans la mise en oeuvre (comme l'a remarqu&eacute; l'&eacute;tude Post-Fidji). Dans les pays ACP o&ugrave; les gouvernements fonctionnent bien et o&ugrave; les capacit&eacute;s administratives sont suffisantes, il est tax&eacute; de paternalisme. Dans les pays o&ugrave; la gestion publique et les capacit&eacute;s administratives laissent &agrave; d&eacute;sirer, la &#171;cogestion&#187; s'av&egrave;re &ecirc;tre une fiction.

<P>

Un autre probl&egrave;me important r&eacute;side dans la concentration des pouvoirs dans les mains de l'ordonnateur national. Ce n'est pas la meilleure fa&ccedil;on de stimuler une utilisation transparente des ressources. Les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques se plaignent de ce que le programme indicatif national (PIN) soit souvent &#171;un document top secret&#187;.

<P>

<LI><I>Centralisation et obsession du contr&#244;le</I>. Les soucis &#171;d'efficacit&eacute;&#187;, de &#171;d&eacute;penses&#187; et de &#171;r&eacute;sultat&#187; ont abouti &agrave; une centralisation extr&ecirc;me des services de la Commission ainsi qu'&agrave; une pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence pour les approches et les proc&eacute;dures standard. Cela a aliment&eacute; la bureaucratisation dans l'application des proc&eacute;dures de Lom&eacute;. En cons&eacute;quence, les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations ont du mal &agrave; r&eacute;agir de mani&egrave;re efficace aux diff&eacute;rentes r&eacute;alit&eacute;s sur le terrain. En outre, une forte pression s'exerce sur les organismes donateurs qui doivent rendre compte de la moindre d&eacute;pense. Cela a engendr&eacute; une v&eacute;ritable &#171;obsession du contr&#244;le&#187; (financier) au sein de la CE. Le personnel d'une d&eacute;l&eacute;gation fait remarquer que le &#171;pouvoir [&agrave; Bruxelles] semble &ecirc;tre principalement entre les mains de comptables qui, pour la plupart, n'ont jamais v&eacute;cu dans un pays en d&eacute;veloppement et qui ont d&eacute;truit l'esprit novateur qui a souffl&eacute; sur la DG VIII au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 80, &agrave; l'&eacute;poque o&ugrave; des commissaires ax&eacute;s sur le d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;taient &agrave; la direction&#187;.

<P>

<LI><I>Contraintes de capacit&eacute;s</I>. Il est &agrave; pr&eacute;sent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement admis que les deux parties ne poss&egrave;dent pas les capacit&eacute;s n&eacute;cessaires pour assumer leurs fonctions respectives dans le partenariat de Lom&eacute;, ni pour assurer une mise en oeuvre ad&eacute;quate. Cependant, d'importantes mesures restent &agrave; prendre pour rem&eacute;dier &agrave; cette situation.

<P>

<H3>Actions prioritaires</H3>

<P>

La plupart de ces obstacles existent depuis longtemps. Les tentatives de r&eacute;forme pr&eacute;c&eacute;dentes ne sont apparemment pas parvenues &agrave; les traiter de mani&egrave;re appropri&eacute;e. Cela laisse supposer que des approches plus audacieuses sont n&eacute;cessaires pour progresser r&eacute;ellement. Les ACP comme l'UE ont int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; rompre avec la routine. La cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement en d&eacute;pend.

<P>

<H4>Elaborer un accord facile &agrave; appliquer</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171;Nous devons &ecirc;tre plus pratiques et mettre au point un instrument plus compact&#187; (un ambassadeur ACP).</I>

<P>

Pour la majorit&eacute; des gens concern&eacute;s par Lom&eacute;, un accord plus simple, plus l&eacute;ger et plus facile &agrave; utiliser est n&eacute;cessaire pour rendre la coop&eacute;ration plus efficace. Certains vont m&ecirc;me jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;tendre qu'un &#171;accord d'une page suffirait s'il comportait les conditions de base de la coop&eacute;ration&#187;.

<P>

C'est un peu exag&eacute;r&eacute;. Pourtant, les principes de base sont clairs; les mots cl&eacute;s sont clart&eacute;, r&eacute;alisme, accessibilit&eacute; et transparence. Clart&eacute; signifie des d&eacute;clarations sans &eacute;quivoque sur la base politique de la coop&eacute;ration (les r&egrave;gles du jeu convenues mutuellement). Le r&eacute;alisme est n&eacute;cessaire pour d&eacute;finir des objectifs et des buts qui ne soient pas trop ambitieux. L'accessibilit&eacute; est n&eacute;cessaire pour ouvrir la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne aux acteurs non &eacute;tatiques (dans le Sud comme dans le Nord). Mettre la transparence en avant n&eacute;cessite une r&eacute;partition pragmatique des t&acirc;ches de gestion entre les partenaires.

<P>

<H4>Inverser la logique: faire passer la strat&eacute;gie d'abord</H4>

<P>

Selon le groupe de r&eacute;flexion de la Commission sur le &#171;Partenariat 2000&#187;, il n'est pas tr&egrave;s sens&eacute; de s'engager &agrave; nouveau dans un grand d&eacute;bat sur les aspects techniques des instruments et des proc&eacute;dures. Un tel &#171;rafistolage&#187; est inappropri&eacute; si l'on tient compte des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s g&eacute;opolitiques actuelles et de la crise de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; que traverse la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement (europ&eacute;enne). Cette approche n'apporte pas non plus de r&eacute;ponse appropri&eacute;e aux besoins de d&eacute;veloppement des pays ACP. Dans la reconception de Lom&eacute;, il est important de &#171;retourner &agrave; l'essentiel&#187;, c'est-&agrave;-dire de donner la priorit&eacute; &agrave; la strat&eacute;gie avant de se pr&eacute;occuper des instruments et des proc&eacute;dures. Cela n&eacute;cessite une logique diff&eacute;rente dans la d&eacute;termination et la mise en oeuvre des programmes de coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

Par cons&eacute;quent, la Commission recommande une nouvelle approche dans laquelle on identifie d'abord les principaux d&eacute;fis et contraintes de d&eacute;veloppement pour les diff&eacute;rents pays et r&eacute;gions ACP, puis on pr&eacute;sente les strat&eacute;gies de r&eacute;action possibles - en d&eacute;taillant la contribution sp&eacute;cifique que peut apporter la CE - et on s&eacute;lectionne alors seulement les instruments et les strat&eacute;gies de mise en oeuvre.

<P>

Cette approche ouvre aussi de nouvelles perspectives pour les pays ACP. Elle permet de mettre leurs besoins de d&eacute;veloppement (vari&eacute;s) en avant. Elle permet &eacute;galement de tenir une discussion s&eacute;rieuse sur la valeur ajout&eacute;e de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement europ&eacute;enne (compar&eacute;e &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration bilat&eacute;rale et &agrave; celle d'autres bailleurs de fonds). Cette approche peut &eacute;galement contribuer &agrave; identifier la  &#171;combinaison d'instruments&#187; la plus appropri&eacute;e pour r&eacute;pondre aux besoins des diff&eacute;rents pays et r&eacute;gions ACP.

<P>

<H4>Assurer la coh&eacute;rence entre les instruments</H4>

<P>

En th&eacute;orie, le fait que Lom&eacute; dispose d'un grand choix d'instruments n'est pas une mauvaise chose; la diversit&eacute; apporte la flexibilit&eacute; et permet des approches int&eacute;gr&eacute;es bas&eacute;es sur une combinaison de diff&eacute;rents instruments. Dans la pratique, cependant, peu de pays ACP parviennent vraiment &agrave; utiliser le potentiel de Lom&eacute; d'une mani&egrave;re coh&eacute;rente et int&eacute;gr&eacute;e. Des efforts ont &eacute;t&eacute; faits aux cours des derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es pour r&eacute;soudre ce probl&egrave;me, mais sans grand r&eacute;sultat.

<P>

Voici quelques-unes des options visant &agrave; rendre la future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE plus coh&eacute;rente:

<P>

<LI><B><I>R&eacute;duire le nombre d'instruments</B></I>. Les victimes pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;es d'un tel processus de r&eacute;duction sont les diff&eacute;rents outils financiers entrant dans le cadre des ressources non programmables et les &#171;dotations incitatives&#187; (l'appui aux r&eacute;formes institutionnelles et administratives, par exemple). Dans le concept original, le PIN &eacute;tait la pierre angulaire de la coop&eacute;ration de Lom&eacute;.  Traditionnellement, une part importante du Fonds europ&eacute;en de d&eacute;veloppement  &eacute;tait pr&eacute;-attribu&eacute;e (une sorte d'allocation) au PIN. Au cours des ans, cependant, l'UE a cherch&eacute; &agrave; accro&icirc;tre son influence sur l'utilisation des ressources de Lom&eacute; en pla&ccedil;ant plus d'argent dans des fonds sp&eacute;ciaux r&eacute;serv&eacute;s aux pays qui satisfont aux crit&egrave;res d'&eacute;ligibilit&eacute;. Si cette pratique a peut-&ecirc;tre r&eacute;pondu aux exigences de justification des bailleurs de fonds, cette &#171;compartimentalisation&#187; de Lom&eacute; a compliqu&eacute; la gestion au quotidien.

<P>

De nombreux responsables de l'UE estiment qu'il est n&eacute;cessaire de r&eacute;sister &agrave; la tendance de compartimenter davantage les accords futurs. Le nombre de syst&egrave;mes devrait plut&#244;t &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;rablement r&eacute;duit. D'autres ne sont pas d'accord avec cette proposition et pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent une vari&eacute;t&eacute; de fonds li&eacute;s &agrave; la performance et allou&eacute;s &agrave; &#171;ceux qui les m&eacute;ritent suivant le principe du premier arriv&eacute;, premier servi&#187;.

<P>

<LI><B><I>R&eacute;tablir la position centrale de l'exercice de programmation</B></I>. C'est sans aucun doute l'option pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;e de beaucoup de personnes interrog&eacute;es. Elles affirment qu'une plus grande coh&eacute;rence est li&eacute;e &agrave; la position centrale de l'exercice de programmation en tant que base de l'allocation de l'aide au niveau national. Au lieu de disperser l'argent dans un grand nombre de fonds distincts - chacun ayant ses proc&eacute;dures particuli&egrave;res - il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable de rassembler ces ressources et de les int&eacute;grer dans des politiques et des programmes de d&eacute;veloppement nationaux. C'est pour cette raison que les PIN ont &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute;s il y a vingt ans. Les ACP estiment que le PIN demeure un instrument aussi valable qu'auparavant. Il laisse l'initiative au pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Tout en garantissant la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute;, c'est aussi l'instrument par excellence du dialogue politique.

<P>

A premi&egrave;re vue, cette proposition semble extr&ecirc;mement attrayante. En deuxi&egrave;me analyse, cependant, il appara&icirc;t qu'une application r&eacute;ussie de cette option d&eacute;pend des conditions locales actuelles. Cela peut r&eacute;ussir dans les pays ACP dot&eacute;s d'une gestion &eacute;conomique et politique fonctionnant bien. Si une r&eacute;elle confiance existe entre les partenaires, la Commission europ&eacute;enne devrait r&eacute;tablir la position centrale de l'exercice de programmation et adopter une approche plus souple en ce qui concerne la d&eacute;cision de l'utilisation des ressources de Lom&eacute;. En fonction des besoins sp&eacute;cifiques du pays concern&eacute;, il devrait &ecirc;tre possible d'utiliser le PIN pour coordonner tous les fonds de la CE destin&eacute;s aux investissements, &agrave; l'appui de la balance des paiements, &agrave; l'aide budg&eacute;taire ou &agrave; l'all&eacute;gement de la dette.

<P>

Cette option semble moins r&eacute;aliste dans les pays ACP en proie &agrave; des troubles politiques, &agrave; de graves probl&egrave;mes de gestion publique ou &agrave; une d&eacute;faillance g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des capacit&eacute;s administratives. On voit mal comment ces pays pourraient identifier vraiment leurs besoins de d&eacute;veloppement les plus urgents, &eacute;tablir des priorit&eacute;s appropri&eacute;es et s'engager dans un dialogue avec la Commission au sujet d'un programme national. La concentration de moyens financiers entre les mains de gouvernements irresponsables est d&eacute;sormais inacceptable en Europe. On ne peut vraiment pas envisager d'aide budg&eacute;taire directe dans ce cas. Il faudra entretenir un autre type de partenariat dans ces pays, fond&eacute; sur une autre panoplie d'instruments (par exemple, un programme indicatif restreint, concentr&eacute; sur un nombre limit&eacute; de secteurs et soumis &agrave; des conditionnalit&eacute;s clairement &eacute;tablies).

<P>

<LI><B><I>D&eacute;composer la Convention en diff&eacute;rentes parties</B></I>. Cette option vise &agrave; parvenir &agrave; une efficacit&eacute; et &agrave; une coh&eacute;rence accrues en partageant la Convention en diff&eacute;rents fonds, sur une base fonctionnelle, qui seraient g&eacute;r&eacute;s de fa&ccedil;on ind&eacute;pendante par diff&eacute;rents acteurs sur la base de leur avantage comparatif (en appliquant le principe de subsidiarit&eacute;). Au lieu d'avoir un fonds de Lom&eacute; dans un pays donn&eacute; - fonds g&eacute;r&eacute; exclusivement par l'Etat -, on en aurait plusieurs. Un sc&eacute;nario possible serait d'avoir trois fonds principaux: un fonds du gouvernement (correspondant assez aux actuels PIN pour assurer l'ex&eacute;cution de la plupart des fonctions du gouvernement), un fonds du secteur priv&eacute; et un fonds pour la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; (destin&eacute; principalement aux organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile).

<P>

<H4>Inventer de nouvelles approches de gestion</H4>

<P>

Pour venir &agrave; bout des &eacute;cueils existant de longue date dans la gestion quotidienne des conventions successives, les options suivantes ont &eacute;t&eacute; propos&eacute;es:

<P>

<LI><B><I>Trouver des alternatives &agrave; la cogestion</B></I>. Comme nous l'avons signal&eacute; pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment, l'opinion que la cogestion est une impasse recueille un large consensus. Ici aussi, dans la recherche d'alternatives, la diff&eacute;renciation par pays semble apporter une solution. Dans les pays ACP dot&eacute;s de gouvernements fonctionnant bien, la Commission n'a plus d'excuse pour adopter des approches de gestion extr&ecirc;mement centralis&eacute;es. Il faut imaginer un nouveau syst&egrave;me qui donne l'enti&egrave;re responsabilit&eacute; de la gestion des ressources de Lom&eacute; au partenaire local tout en permettant au bailleur de fonds d'exercer un contr&#244;le sur les r&eacute;sulats. La cogestion n'a pas beaucoup de sens non plus dans les pays o&ugrave; la gestion publique et les capacit&eacute;s de l'administration laissent &agrave; d&eacute;sirer.

<P>

On peut envisager ici diff&eacute;rentes options, en fonction des conditions locales. Dans certains cas, la CE conclura peut-&ecirc;tre qu'aucune relation de partenariat ne peut s'&eacute;tablir. Dans d'autres pays, elle pourrait d&eacute;cider d'assumer une partie des responsabilit&eacute;s de gestion &agrave; la place du partenaire ACP, avec les risques de d&eacute;pendance de l'aide que cela entra&icirc;ne. Si les contraintes de capacit&eacute; constituent le principal probl&egrave;me (comme c'est le cas dans les petites &icirc;les du Pacifique), l'apport d'un soutien institutionnel contribuera peut-&ecirc;tre &agrave; cr&eacute;er les conditions n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; une mise en oeuvre efficace des programmes de d&eacute;veloppement par les pays ACP eux-m&ecirc;mes.

<P>

<LI><B><I>Revoir le r&#244;le de l'ON</B></I>. Bien que l'on reconnaisse l'ON comme point de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence et comme principal n&eacute;gociateur, il a &eacute;t&eacute; estim&eacute; en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral que la future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE devrait &eacute;galement permettre des contributions des minist&egrave;res techniques et sectoriels et d'acteurs non &eacute;tatiques. Une fa&ccedil;on d'y arriver consisterait &agrave; organiser des dialogues structur&eacute;s au niveau national par l'interm&eacute;diaire de comit&eacute;s directeurs r&eacute;unissant tous les acteurs et parties prenantes du pays (gouvernement, secteur priv&eacute;, ONG, chercheurs) pour d&eacute;cider de l'utilisation des fonds de Lom&eacute;. Une structure similaire existe en C&#244;te d'Ivoire avec le Comit&eacute; national pour la gestion du programme indicatif national; cela s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; efficace dans l'&eacute;tablissement des grandes priorit&eacute;s nationales pour la coop&eacute;ration avec l'UE. Dans cette approche, cependant, la gestion des fonds doit rester fermement ancr&eacute;e dans la bureaucratie centrale, quoi qu'en pensent les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques.

<P>

<LI><B><I>Acheminer les ressources de Lom&eacute; directement vers les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires</B></I>. Cette option a de nombreux partisans parmi les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques dans les pays ACP. Certains privil&eacute;gient le financement direct sans ing&eacute;rence du gouvernement. D'autres admettent que le soutien aux acteurs non &eacute;tatiques doit s'inscrire dans une structure politique nationale. Les gouvernements ont un r&#244;le &agrave; jouer ici et conserveront, in&eacute;vitablement, l'autorit&eacute; politique et financi&egrave;re globale dans la d&eacute;cision de l'utilisation des ressources d'aide. A leurs yeux, cependant, le gouvernement ne peut pr&eacute;tendre &agrave; un r&#244;le similaire dans la gestion (mise en oeuvre) des programmes de Lom&eacute;. A ce niveau, les responsabilit&eacute;s de gestion devraient &ecirc;tre accord&eacute;es aux acteurs les mieux &agrave; m&ecirc;me d'accomplir ces t&acirc;ches.

<P>

Le secteur priv&eacute; fournit un bon exemple. Si le dialogue entre les secteurs public et priv&eacute; est essentiel pour l'&eacute;tablissement des priorit&eacute;s nationales et le soutien de l'UE qui y est li&eacute;, la gestion des &#171;programmes de d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;&#187; devrait &ecirc;tre fermement maintenue entre les mains de ces organisations elles-m&ecirc;mes. Si cette option est retenue, il ne faudrait pas le faire de fa&ccedil;on improvis&eacute;e. Certains risques potentiels devraient &ecirc;tre examin&eacute;s attentivement, tels que les questions de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; et de responsabilit&eacute; des organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et du secteur priv&eacute; (voir chapitre 6).

<P>

<H4>D&eacute;centraliser la prise de d&eacute;cision et la mise en oeuvre de la CE</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171;L'obsession de contr&#244;le de la Commission est un sympt&#244;me &eacute;vident d'une institution en crise. Le personnel de la Commission consacre le plus clair de son temps &agrave; des proc&eacute;dures d'appel d'offres, &agrave; des ordres de paiement, au contr&#244;le financier. Il ne reste alors gu&egrave;re de temps pour discuter du contenu de la coop&eacute;ration&#187; (un conseiller technique aupr&egrave;s d'un ON).</I>

<P>

Plusieurs options ont &eacute;t&eacute; avanc&eacute;es pour surmonter ce vieux probl&egrave;me :

<P>

<LI><B><I>D&eacute;centraliser vers le terrain</B></I>, en renfor&ccedil;ant les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations et en leur accordant davantage de pouvoir de d&eacute;cision, y compris pour l'engagement de d&eacute;penses plus importantes;

<P>

<LI><B><I>Revoir les r&#244;les et les responsabilit&eacute;s du personnel de la Commission </B></I>&agrave; Bruxelles et sur le terrain. Au lieu de mettre l'accent sur des fonctions purement bureaucratiques, (contr&#244;le financier, ordres de paiement), le personnel devrait s'impliquer davantage dans du travail d'analyse et de contenu;

<P>

<LI><B><I>Etablir des r&eacute;serves r&eacute;gionales </B></I>o&ugrave; l'essentiel de la comp&eacute;tence de la Commission devrait &ecirc;tre concentr&eacute; et o&ugrave; devrait se trouver la majeure partie du contr&#244;le financier et de l'expertise technique.

<P>

<H4>Donner un mandat r&eacute;aliste &agrave; la Commission europ&eacute;enne</H4>

<P>

Il est de plus en plus reconnu que les contraintes de capacit&eacute;s internes &agrave; la CE constituent une partie du probl&egrave;me de mise en oeuvre de Lom&eacute;. Dans tout futur accord de coop&eacute;ration, il faudrait r&eacute;soudre toutes ces incoh&eacute;rences de l'organisme donateur. Si le manque de personnel &agrave; Bruxelles et dans les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations constitue assur&eacute;ment un probl&egrave;me crucial, le mandat &#171;impossible&#187; de la CE porte &eacute;galement une large part de responsabilit&eacute;.

<P>

Depuis Lom&eacute; I, le rayon d'action de la CE s'est &eacute;largi de fa&ccedil;on syst&eacute;matique. La CE est cens&eacute;e &ecirc;tre active dans tous les domaines politiques et coordonner tous les instruments de Lom&eacute; de mani&egrave;re coh&eacute;rente. Parmi les options de r&eacute;forme, citons:

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Finnish Development Cooperation</h3>



Finnish development cooperation started in the early 1960s and has traditionally been based on the political

consensus that linked foreign policy, economic, and ethical interests. The ethical motives, both religious and

humanistic, hold that the satisfaction of people's basic needs is a general human right. Changes in the

international political situation and a severe domestic economic recession force the Government to re-

orientate its development cooperation policy. Traditional political consensus is under heavy pressure.

Following drastic cuts in ODA in 1993, changes in the composition of Finnish aid are called for from

different directions. From inside the administration growing commitments to international credit institutions

generated an abrupt shift in the multilateral-bilateral aid ratio. Secondly, Finnish EU membership will put an

disproportional large claim on current development funds. It is yet unknown whether traditional ethic

motives will hold up against the new foreign policy and commercial interests. Still, public support for

development cooperation is strong.

<p>

Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 644 million, which was 0.62 per cent of GNP.

After a fast growth in the past decade, the Government imposed massive budget cuts which made the

percentage drop to 0.40 per cent of GNP in 1993. The ODA of the approved development cooperation

budget for 1994 will amount to 0.30 per cent of GNP. Finland used to disburse about 40 per cent of its

ODA through multilateral channels, mainly UN organisations. However, in recent years this percentage has

fallen to less then 20 per cent, with a growing proportion going to the World Bank.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Official Finnish development cooperation is not based on an organic law. Various development cooperation

programmes are laid down in a number of specific laws. In the 1991 coalition government a Minister for

Development Cooperation was included for the first time. He serves within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

and is responsible for the Department of International Development Cooperation (FINNIDA), which is

located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The former function of Under-Secretary of State for

Development Cooperation was maintained after the installation of the Minister. FINNIDA is in charge of the

overall policy for international cooperation, and administers the major part of the aid programme, i.e. 70

per cent of ODA (1994). The remaining 30 per cent is mainly administered by the Ministry of Health and

Social Welfare on behalf of refugees in Finland.

<p>

In 1991 FINNIDA was reorganised along functional lines in order to strengthen its policy coordination

functions. The unit for policy coordination is now in charge of overall mid-term planning and budgeting as

well as with assisting the Director-General and the Under-Secretary of State for Development Cooperation.

The latter is in charge of policy-related matters, at the same time being an advisor to the Minister.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

In Finland, advisory boards and committees are a common part of the administrational set-up. There is a

Board for Customs Affairs under the Ministry of Finance, with representatives of industry, trade unions and

the farming community. For foreign affairs there are advisory Boards on UN affairs, disarmament

questions, and on human rights.

<p>

Finland has an Advisory Board for Relations with Developing Countries. Parliament decides after the

expiration of the mandate of each Board whether a new advisory board will be installed. The current Board

(KESU) was appointed by the Government in May 1992 for a three year period. The KESU has 10

members, who are nominated by the different political parties represented in Parliament. Members do not

necessarily have to be experts in the field of development cooperation. Some are Members of Parliament, or

journalists, researchers, civil servants and NGO-representatives. The chairman usually has the same political

background as the Prime Minister. The Board has a part-time Executive Secretary, who is an official of the

Policy Coordination Unit of FINNIDA. Former Executive Secretaries have also been placed outside the

Ministry. 

<p>

The current Board has a different mandate than the previous ones (the 'TALKE, I-IV', the first Board

TALKE I was installed in 1979). While the TALKE, I-IV advised on economic relations between Finland

and developing countries, an enlarged mandate permits the KESU to advise on all aspects of Finland's

relations with developing countries. The broader mandate of the KESU may reflect the need that is felt in

Finland to re-orientate development cooperation and to define its future role within the changing

international and domestic economic circumstances. The new Board is engaged in establishing relations with

other departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the political departments and the Department of Trade.

After installation a new Board can nominate a group of advisors. The advisors of the current Board are all

officials from other departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

<p>

The Board may take up topics at its own initiative. The role of KESU is an intermediary one between

FINNIDA and politics. The Board not only gives its views to the Department. FINNIDA also provides

Board members with information on development cooperation, in order to keep their parties and other

groups in society well informed. Most of the advisory work is done during discussions at the Ministry.

These take place about eight times a year. At those meetings the Board or officials of the Ministry present

papers. KESU also comments on draft versions of FINNIDA's new strategies. In the preface of the 1993

Strategy the Minister wrote that the involvement of KESU provided "the text of the strategy statement with

the necessary political realism and parliamentary balance". Another task that illustrates the intermediating

role the Board can play, is its commenting on the annual budget for development cooperation. The budget is

only very generally specified when approved by Parliament. Further elaboration is carried out by FINNIDA.

The KESU can influence choices and specify details. 

<p>

Apart from the meetings at the Ministry, one or two times a year a seminar is organised for the members of

KESU and / or a larger public. Sometimes they are organised in cooperation with the Institute for

Development Studies of the University of Helsinki. Board members are also invited to meetings and

seminars organised by FINNIDA or others, and they receive reports and other documents prepared by the

Department. In April 1994 the KESU organised a seminar on Finland's relations with developing countries

and the European Union, where amongst others the acting Director General of EC/DG VIII held a

presentation. KESU intends to organise a seminar on human resource development.

<p>

The Board may have research conducted on its behalf, and previous Boards (TALKE's) have done so. Since

the KESU has no financial resources, the Board is financed through a special fund for Committees that is at

the disposal of the Minister for Development Cooperation. Apart form the work on the budget and the

discussion on the new Finnish Strategy, KESU has recently delivered statements and position papers on,

amongst others, cultural cooperation with developing countries, Finnish ODA - eligibility of refugee-related

costs and the implementation of the decisions of UNCED The latter statement was submitted to the Ministry

of the Environment. For 1994 the KESU intended to work on the effects of potential EU membership on

Finnish development assistance, and on a Finnish strategy for trade with developing countries. 

<p>

Until the beginning of the 1990s a Nordic Council of the Ministers of Development Cooperation of

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden met bi-annually to discuss policy issues. Adjacent to these

meetings advisory meetings were organised of parliamentarians and researchers from the five countries. One

of these advisory meetings was a seminar Human Rights and Democracy held in Helsinki. The proceedings

were published in English. It is not known whether these meetings will be continued.

<p>

In Parliament, there are two Sub-Committees involved with development cooperation a Foreign Affairs

Committee and a Finance Committee. Since the recent cuts in budget the influence of Parliament on Finnish

aid has been reduced. The Foreign Affairs Committee is not supposed to deal with budgetary matters and

the Finance Committee is not supposed to make detailed statements on substance. 

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

NGOs in Finland such as trade unions and church based NGOs, traditionally have been strongly involved in

matters of international peace and development cooperation. Initially they were more East-West orientated

than North-South. The Percentage Movement is both a strong lobbying party towards the Government as

well as towards Parliament and the broad public. Approximately 60 NGOs are organised in an umbrella

organisation, the Service Centre for Development Cooperation (KEPA), that amongst others co-organises

public events on development cooperation. In 1994 FINNIDA conducted a major evaluation of NGO

development cooperation. The NGO related share of aid has been protected under the recent budget cuts.

Commitments through NGOs amounted to 2.6 per cent of ODA in 1992. The Government intends to

increase cooperation with NGOs. Among the topics of discussion between NGOs and the Government are:

the revision of Finnish development cooperation against the background of new international political

situations and domestic economic problems and the commercialisation of development aid. 

<p>

In 1992 FINNIDA organised in cooperation with Finnish consultancy firms and NGOs a large public event

on the future of Finnish development cooperation, "People and Development". This will be repeated in

1994.

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey, 17 institutes qualify as 'Development Research and Training

Institutes'. Two institutes can be said to play a role in the policy debate on development cooperation: the

earlier mentioned Institute for Development Studies and the Centre for Training and Development.

<HR><P>

<H3>La n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de repenser les fondements originaux</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171; L'heure n'est pas aux approches de type statu quo. Il nous faut red&eacute;finir la rationalit&eacute; et la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement au-del&agrave; de l'aide d'urgence &agrave; court terme&#187; (un fonctionnaire de la Commission).</I>

<P>

Cette d&eacute;claration d'un fonctionnaire europ&eacute;en constitue le point de d&eacute;part de toute tentative de red&eacute;finition de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs qui ont fa&ccedil;onn&eacute; le cadre de la Convention originelle et ses instruments ne sont plus appropri&eacute;s ou bien ils ont vu leur importance d&eacute;cliner. Des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts nouveaux communs aux deux parties sont apparus sans que la Convention actuelle n'en tienne v&eacute;ritablement compte. 

<P>

Le groupe ACP est conscient d'avoir perdu une grande partie de son poids politique et &eacute;conomique face &agrave; l'UE. L'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t d&eacute;clinant de l'Europe &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de Lom&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; tr&egrave;s bien caract&eacute;ris&eacute; par un chercheur ACP qui d&eacute;clare que la Convention est &#171;un symbole de la p&eacute;riode coloniale que l'Europe pr&eacute;f&eacute;rerait oublier [...]. En tant que partenaires commerciaux, les pays ACP ont manifestement connu un &eacute;chec, et ils ont petit &agrave; petit perdu de leur importance sur le plan politique et &eacute;conomique &#187;. Le groupe ACP craint que l'Europe, aux prises avec des pr&eacute;occupations plus urgentes, ne veuille abandonner la Convention de Lom&eacute; sans proc&eacute;der &agrave; une &eacute;valuation impartiale de son impact en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement, ni rechercher des solutions de rechange appropri&eacute;es. L'Europe leur semble &ecirc;tre &#171;&agrave; la recherche d'une mani&egrave;re &eacute;l&eacute;gante de divorcer de ses partenaires ACP &#187;.

<P>

De plus en plus de pays ACP sont conscients que la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement conna&icirc;t une crise de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;. Dans la plupart des pays europ&eacute;ens, les ministres de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement ont bien du mal &agrave; d&eacute;fendre les budgets d'aide, dans un contexte de pressions internes visant &agrave; r&eacute;duire les d&eacute;ficits et de crise majeure de l'Etat providence. Cette crise de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; de l'aide frappe &eacute;galement certains pays ACP o&ugrave; des voix s'&eacute;l&egrave;vent pour en finir avec le &#171;syndrome de d&eacute;pendance de l'aide&#187;.

<P>

Nombreux sont ceux, dans les pays ACP, qui d&eacute;noncent la lib&eacute;ralisation et la mondialisation, ces panac&eacute;es &agrave; la mode. Ils craignent que l'Europe n'adopte cette id&eacute;ologie de march&eacute; sans prendre suffisamment en compte les implications en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement. Une telle politique compromettrait le maintien de plusieurs dispositions positives pr&eacute;vues par la Convention actuelle qui, selon certains, &#171;ont contribu&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on significative &agrave; l'all&egrave;gement de la pauvret&eacute; dans les pays ACP, &agrave; la mise en place  et &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des infrastructures, et, dans certains cas notoires, &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation d'emplois dans les secteurs d'exportation&#187;.

<P>

Quelles sont les cons&eacute;quences de cette menace pour le d&eacute;bat sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE? Avant tout, cette menace invite les diff&eacute;rentes parties int&eacute;ress&eacute;es &agrave; avancer des arguments convaincants pour donner une nouvelle l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement, ce qui, en fait, revient &agrave; red&eacute;finir les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts actuels et potentiels communs aux pays ACP et &agrave; l'UE &agrave; l'horizon 2000. Il s'agit l&agrave; d'une condition pr&eacute;alable indispensable &agrave; la relance de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE.

<P>

<H3>La possibilit&eacute; d'identifier de nouveaux int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs</H3>

<P>

Deux points de vue s'opposent &agrave; ce sujet :

<P>

Selon une minorit&eacute;, compos&eacute;e principalement de d&eacute;cideurs et de chercheurs europ&eacute;ens, il n'est plus possible de trouver une &#171;communaut&eacute; d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts&#187; solide entre le groupe ACP et l'UE (&agrave; l'exception de la France, peut-&ecirc;tre). Les fondements politiques et &eacute;conomiques du partenariat sont particuli&egrave;rement fragiles. En effet, les pays ACP ne sont pas des partenaires vitaux en ce qui concerne l'approvisionnement en mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res, main-d'oeuvre et services. En outre, ils ne repr&eacute;sentent pas de d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s majeurs pour les exportations, et n'attirent pas les capitaux. Quant aux interd&eacute;pendances n&eacute;gatives (flux migratoires, trafics de drogue, d&eacute;gradation de l'environnement), elles sont per&ccedil;ues comme n&eacute;gligeables. La seule justification qui reste, &agrave; savoir le motif humanitaire, est en soi une base pr&eacute;caire pour la future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE.

<P>

La majorit&eacute; est moins pessimiste. Tout en reconnaissant que les fondements originaux de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE ont subi une certaine &eacute;rosion, elle pense qu'il est encore possible de d&eacute;finir une communaut&eacute; d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts. A un niveau &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire, les esprits cyniques font observer que l'UE retire des avantages substantiels en retour de sa coop&eacute;ration avec les ACP. On ne dispose pas ais&eacute;ment de preuves concr&egrave;tes de ces retomb&eacute;es, mais de nombreux ACP sont convaincus que les entreprises, les bureaux de consultants, les instituts de recherche et les experts europ&eacute;ens retirent des b&eacute;n&eacute;fices substantiels de Lom&eacute;. Au-del&agrave; de cette conception &eacute;troite de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t propre, nombreux sont ceux qui pensent que l'&eacute;thique et la solidarit&eacute; internationale demeurent des bases valables pour la coop&eacute;ration. Utilis&eacute;e &agrave; bon escient, la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement leur semble en mesure d'aider &agrave; pr&eacute;venir la r&eacute;cession et les conflits, &agrave; r&eacute;duire le foss&eacute; entre riches et pauvres, et &agrave; cr&eacute;er des conditions de vie d&eacute;centes dans les pays ACP. Ces objectifs sont per&ccedil;us comme allant &eacute;galement dans le sens des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts (s&eacute;curitaires) du monde d&eacute;velopp&eacute;, et semblent indiquer qu'on peut trouver les &eacute;l&eacute;ments constitutifs d'un nouvel accord de coop&eacute;ration dans ces interd&eacute;pendances n&eacute;gatives. Plut&#244;t que d'adopter une attitude frileuse, l'UE ferait bien de d&eacute;velopper une strat&eacute;gie d'ensemble &agrave; long terme en mati&egrave;re de coop&eacute;ration internationale, incluant les 70 pays ACP. 

<P>

<H3>La voie &agrave; suivre</H3>

<P>

Au premier abord, les arguments avanc&eacute;s par la majorit&eacute; semblent pertinents. Toutefois, dans le climat politique actuel, il est peu probable qu'ils soient suffisants pour relancer la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. Les d&eacute;cideurs europ&eacute;ens sont obs&eacute;d&eacute;s par les pr&eacute;occupations d'ordre interne &agrave; court terme et il est peu probable que les exhortations &agrave; d&eacute;velopper une plus grande solidarit&eacute; avec le Sud re&ccedil;oivent beaucoup d'&eacute;cho. Si les pays ACP veulent conclure un meilleur accord avec l'UE, il leur faudra adopter une approche beaucoup plus dynamique. Il devront convaincre les politiciens et l'opinion publique -&agrave; l'aide d'arguments solides et preuves &agrave; l'appui- de deux choses: premi&egrave;rement, que la coop&eacute;ration avec les pays ACP est pour l'UE une priorit&eacute; l&eacute;gitime, et, deuxi&egrave;mement, qu'il est possible de mettre en oeuvre cette coop&eacute;ration d'une fa&ccedil;on transparente, efficace et aux r&eacute;sultats tangibles.

<P>

A cette fin, il est n&eacute;cessaire de d&eacute;composer le concept d'&#171;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun&#187; pour &eacute;tablir de quelle fa&ccedil;on on peut lui donner plus de substance. Trois options ont &eacute;t&eacute; sugg&eacute;r&eacute;es:

<P>

<LI><B><I>Red&eacute;finir les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs &agrave; diff&eacute;rents niveaux</B></I>. Cette option part du principe qu'il faut analyser et red&eacute;finir le concept d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun sur trois plans : politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re, coop&eacute;ration &eacute;conomique et coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<UL>

<LI><LI><I>Politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re</I>. Les perspectives de nouveaux partenariats bas&eacute;s sur des consid&eacute;rations de politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re sont plut&#244;t sombres. Au premier abord, l'UE ne semble, en effet, pas avoir d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts g&eacute;opolitiques majeurs &agrave; d&eacute;fendre dans les r&eacute;gions ACP. Cependant, on peut mettre en avant que l'Europe a des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts s&eacute;curitaires &agrave; d&eacute;fendre chez ses voisins africains. Elle n'a rien &agrave; gagner &agrave; l'instabilit&eacute; politique, aux conflits et au chaos qui n&eacute;cessitent des op&eacute;rations de secours et de r&eacute;habilitation co&ucirc;teuses. Il est moins on&eacute;reux, nous enseigne l'exp&eacute;rience, de pr&eacute;venir que de gu&eacute;rir. Cet argument est moins appropri&eacute;, toutefois, en ce qui concerne les zones des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique que de nombreux d&eacute;cideurs europ&eacute;ens consid&egrave;rent comme faisant partie d'autres constellations g&eacute;opolitiques.

<P>

<LI><LI><I>Coop&eacute;ration &eacute;conomique</I>. A premi&egrave;re vue, il est tout aussi difficile de cerner de nouveaux int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs &eacute;mergeant au plan &eacute;conomique. A l'exception de certains p&#244;les de croissance (pensons &agrave; l'Afrique australe, &agrave; l'Afrique de l'Ouest francophone, &agrave; l'&icirc;le Maurice), les ACP sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme d'importance marginale. En y regardant de plus pr&egrave;s, cette analyse peut se r&eacute;v&eacute;ler limit&eacute;e. Certains affirment que l'Europe a bel et bien un ensemble d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques &agrave; moyen terme &agrave; d&eacute;fendre en Afrique, aux Cara&iuml;bes et, dans une moindre mesure, dans le Pacifique. L'Afrique, par exemple, dispose d'un march&eacute; potentiel d'un demi milliard d'individus et elle est richement pourvue en ressources strat&eacute;giques. Les relations de longue date qu'entretient l'Europe avec l'Afrique lui procurent un avantage par rapport &agrave; d'autres puissances &eacute;conomiques. Il est &eacute;tonnant de constater que les investissements des Etats-Unis et du Japon se sont accrus de fa&ccedil;on significative en Afrique, en particulier en Afrique australe, alors m&ecirc;me que l'Europe semble rester dans l'expectative, voire adopter une attitude de retrait. Dans les Cara&iuml;bes, on souligne que le potentiel de coop&eacute;ration &eacute;conomique demeure en grande partie inexploit&eacute;. Des <I>

joint-ventures</I> pourraient &ecirc;tre &eacute;tablies dans de nouveaux secteurs de croissance (tourisme, environnement, services) et entre divers acteurs europ&eacute;ens et cara&iuml;bes (bien au-del&agrave; du champ actuel des relations de gouvernement &agrave; gouvernement). Des avanc&eacute;es en direction de la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; sont susceptibles de donner une impulsion suppl&eacute;mentaire &agrave; l'expansion des relations commerciales et des investissements. Pour la r&eacute;gion des Cara&iuml;bes, &#171;sauvegarder une coop&eacute;ration politique et &eacute;conomique diversifi&eacute;e avec l'Europe est un enjeu vital, notamment pour &eacute;viter une d&eacute;pendance exclusive &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des Etats-Unis et de l'Am&eacute;rique latine&#187;. En &eacute;change, elle peut apporter &agrave; l'Europe &#171;une voie d'acc&egrave;s aux march&eacute;s r&eacute;gionaux &eacute;mergeant dans l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re&#187;. M&ecirc;me dans le Pacifique, l'Europe peut avoir des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques et strat&eacute;giques &agrave; d&eacute;fendre (ressources des fonds marins, tourisme, protection de l'environnement). Avec des ressources limit&eacute;es, l'UE peut se doter d'un profil haut dans le Pacifique.

<P>

Les exemples ci-dessus sugg&egrave;rent qu'il faut proc&eacute;der &agrave; une recherche bien document&eacute;e pour articuler les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques r&eacute;els et potentiels entre l'UE et les ACP dans une perspective &agrave; moyen et &agrave; long terme.

<P>

<LI><LI><I>Coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement</I>. Les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs dans le domaine de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement sont plus &eacute;vidents. Aux termes du trait&eacute; de Maastricht, l'UE s'est engag&eacute;e en faveur d'objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement ambitieux. Ces priorit&eacute;s vont parfaitement dans le sens des besoins en d&eacute;veloppement du groupe ACP, qui compte dans ses rangs certains des pays les plus pauvres du monde. Dans ce contexte, de l'avis de certains, le d&eacute;bat sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE portera r&eacute;ellement sur l'opposition entre &#171;mondialisation&#187; et &#171;d&eacute;veloppement&#187;. Il est &agrave; noter que le r&#244;le central des march&eacute;s n'est que tr&egrave;s rarement remis en cause. Pourtant, force est de constater qu'&agrave; ce stade, de nombreuses questions demeurent sans r&eacute;ponse. De quelle fa&ccedil;on assurer une int&eacute;gration en douceur et graduelle des pays en d&eacute;veloppement les plus vuln&eacute;rables et les plus pauvres dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale de march&eacute;? Comment &eacute;viter la marginalisation de la plupart des pays ACP? Ou, pour reprendre les termes d'un ambassadeur ACP: &#171;Quel m&eacute;lange judicieux de politiques et de mesures efficaces est n&eacute;cessaire pour faire face aux probl&egrave;mes d'une grande partie des pauvres de la plan&egrave;te?&#187;

</UL>

<P>

<LI><B><I>Int&eacute;grer les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs du secteur priv&eacute;</B></I>. Par le pass&eacute;, les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts publics -apanage des gouvernements- ont domin&eacute; le partenariat de Lom&eacute;. Dans la tentative de red&eacute;finition des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs, il est crucial d'inclure &eacute;galement les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du secteur priv&eacute; et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, &agrave; la fois au sein des ACP et en Europe. En effet, l'ouverture graduelle des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s africaines a sem&eacute; les germes d'un secteur priv&eacute; dynamique (au Kenya et en C&#244;te d'Ivoire par exemple). En l'absence d'une r&eacute;ponse europ&eacute;enne, ces op&eacute;rateurs priv&eacute;s se tournent vers le Japon et le Moyen-Orient. Or, ne pas prendre conscience de ses int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &agrave; moyen terme sur ces march&eacute;s en expansion d&eacute;noterait de la part de l'UE un manque de vision certain. Etablir des liens avec ces int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts priv&eacute;s pourrait aider &agrave; promouvoir des <I>joint-ventures </I>entre des acteurs du Nord et du Sud. 

<P>

<LI><B><I>Red&eacute;finir des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs dans une perspective r&eacute;gionale</B></I>. Les partisans de cette option avancent qu'il serait beaucoup plus ais&eacute; de red&eacute;finir des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs r&eacute;gion par r&eacute;gion plut&#244;t que dans le cadre de l'ensemble du groupe ACP. Selon eux, il n'est pas judicieux de consid&eacute;rer en bloc 70 pays h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;nes. Il en ressort une d&eacute;finition tr&egrave;s floue des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs (bas&eacute;s sur le plus petit commun d&eacute;nominateur ou sur une palette ahurissante d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts disparates), totalement d&eacute;connect&eacute;e des besoins sp&eacute;cifiques de chaque r&eacute;gion. Qui plus est, cela ne peut qu'inciter l'UE &agrave; adopter des politiques et des approches uniformes.

<P>

L'adoption d'une approche r&eacute;gionale permettrait d'&eacute;viter cet &eacute;cueil. Dans la r&eacute;gion des Cara&iuml;bes, par exemple, il n'existe pas de probl&egrave;mes majeurs en mati&egrave;re de gouvernance et de d&eacute;mocratie qui soient &agrave; m&ecirc;me d'hypoth&eacute;quer la coop&eacute;ration avec l'UE. La plupart des pays sont int&eacute;ress&eacute;s au premier chef par le d&eacute;veloppement d'un nouveau partenariat commercial avec l'UE, reposant sur l'introduction progressive de la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; et sur une assistance dans le processus difficile de diversification des exportations. Un processus d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale se met en place progressivement, englobant aussi des Etats des Cara&iuml;bes qui ne sont pas associ&eacute;s &agrave; Lom&eacute;. Tous ces facteurs semblent justifier la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'un nouvel accord de coop&eacute;ration &agrave; n&eacute;gocier sur une base r&eacute;gionale. Il en r&eacute;sulterait un partenariat beaucoup plus sain et solide, &eacute;tabli sur des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs conjointement accept&eacute;s. Cette question de la diff&eacute;renciation r&eacute;gionale sera examin&eacute;e en d&eacute;tail au chapitre 3.

Le Conseil D&eacute;veloppement, r&eacute;uni ce mardi &agrave;

Bruxelles sous la Pr&eacute;sidence de M. Rino Serri, secr&eacute;taire

d'Etat italien aux Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res, a

progress&eacute; sans encombres sur les quatre textes visant &agrave;

fournir une base juridique &agrave; des domaines d'intervention

importants de la politique de coop&eacute;ration de l'Union avec

le tiers monde.

<P>

Le Conseil a, en effet, adopt&eacute; formellement, en deuxi&egrave;me

lecture, le r&egrave;glement sur l'aide humanitaire et approuv&eacute;

en 1&egrave;re lecture ses &quot;positions communes&quot; sur

les 3 r&egrave;glements &quot;r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s des PVD d'Am&eacute;rique

latine et d'Asie&quot; (PVDALA), &quot;lutte contre le sida&quot;

et &quot;environnement et d&eacute;veloppement durable&quot;.

Pour ces trois dossiers, la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation britannique

n'a pas fait jouer sa r&eacute;serve de principe, arguant du fait

que la majorit&eacute; qualifi&eacute;e s'appliquait (en r&eacute;alit&eacute;,

l'unanimit&eacute; &eacute;tait requise, le Conseil ayant modifi&eacute;

la proposition de la Commission sur la question controvers&eacute;e

de la comitologie, sans l'accord de celle-ci).

<P>

Le Conseil a d&eacute;battu avec des r&eacute;sultats positifs

de tous les autres sujets inscrits &agrave; son ordre du jour,

mais n'a pas pu proc&eacute;der &agrave; l'adoption formelle des

r&eacute;solutions ou conclusions pr&eacute;vues, en raison de

l'opposition des Britanniques. L'adoption formelle aura lieu sans

d&eacute;bat lors d'un prochain Conseil, d&egrave;s que le Royaume-Uni

le rendra possible.

<P>

<U><B>Compte-rendu d&eacute;taill&eacute; des r&eacute;sultats

du Conseil.</B></U>

<P>

A la lumi&egrave;re de l'attitude de principe du Royaume-Uni sur

les diff&eacute;rents points &agrave; l'ordre du jour, le Conseil

&quot;coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement&quot; a abouti

aux r&eacute;sultats suivants sur les diff&eacute;rents points

inscrits &agrave; son ordre du jour:

<P>

<B>1.</B> <B>Aide humanitaire</B>: le Conseil a approuv&eacute;

en principe le r&egrave;glement qui fournira une base juridique

aux activit&eacute;s d'Echo (Office humanitaire de la Communaut&eacute;)

qui se sont &eacute;norm&eacute;ment d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es

(environ 750 M&eacute;cus en 1995). Ce r&egrave;glement assigne

des objectifs clairs et des crit&egrave;res g&eacute;n&eacute;raux

&agrave; l'aide humanitaire en d&eacute;finissant les types d'interventions

et les liens entre l'aide humanitaire et la pr&eacute;paration

aux catastrophes, la r&eacute;habilitation et la reconstruction.

Il fixe &eacute;galement les proc&eacute;dures de mise en oeuvre

des actions humanitaires men&eacute;es en coop&eacute;ration avec

les ONG, et des programmes d'aide financ&eacute;s par la Communaut&eacute;.

L'adoption formelle du r&egrave;glement interviendra apr&egrave;s

mise au point du texte.

<P>

<B>2.</B> <B>Aide aux r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s PVDALA, lutte contre

le sida dans les PVD, protection de l'environnement dans le contexte

du d&eacute;veloppement durable</B>: le Conseil a approuv&eacute;

ses &quot;positions communes&quot; sur chacun de ces trois r&egrave;glements.

L'accord politique sur la question la plus d&eacute;licate de

la comitologie (qui d&eacute;termine le degr&eacute; d'autonomie

d&eacute;cisionnelle de la Commission) a &eacute;t&eacute; atteint

sur la base d'un compromis de la Pr&eacute;sidence, que la Commission

n'accepte pas.

<P>

<B>3. Liens entre l'aide d'urgence, l'aide &agrave; la r&eacute;habilitation

et le d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; lONG terme</B>: le Conseil

a proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; un d&eacute;bat approfondi et

un large consensus s'est d&eacute;gag&eacute; sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

d'un continuum entre ces trois aspects de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement,

ce qui suppose notamment que les ONG soient impliqu&eacute;es

dans les actions de d&eacute;veloppement, au-del&agrave; de l'urgence.

Les conclusions n'ont pu &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;es, pour les

raisons indiqu&eacute;es.

<P>

Voici la teneur de ce projet de conclusions, que le Conseil a

ins&eacute;r&eacute; dans le communiqu&eacute; de presse m&ecirc;me

si elles ne sont pas formellement adopt&eacute;es:

<P>

a) l'UE souscrit &agrave; l'id&eacute;e que le renforcement des

liens entre l'aide d'urgence, la r&eacute;habilitation et le d&eacute;veloppement

doit s'op&eacute;rer progressivement selon le sch&eacute;ma propos&eacute;

par la Commission

<P>

b) la Commission &eacute;laborera avec les Etats membres int&eacute;ress&eacute;s

des cadres de politique globale pour un certain nombre de pays

ou r&eacute;gions - notamment ceux qui peuvent &ecirc;tre expos&eacute;s

&agrave; des risques politiques ou &eacute;conomiques et &agrave;

des tensions ou des catastrophes naturelles, et elle d&eacute;finira

plus clairement les moyens coiicrets de renforcer les liens entre

l'aide d'urgence, la r&eacute;habilitation et le d&eacute;veloppement

<P>

c) &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de la premi&egrave;re exp&eacute;rience

acquise en la mati&egrave;re, le Conseil D&eacute;veloppement

proc&eacute;dera &agrave; un nouvel &eacute;change de vues lors

de sa prochaine session (novembre 1996) qui d&eacute;bouchera

sur l' adoption d' une r&eacute;solution et l'&eacute;tablissement

de principes

<P>

La Commission a recens&eacute; 12 pays ou r&eacute;gions qui pourraient

faire l'objet de ce premier exercice: Angola, Liberia, Ha&iuml;ti,

Somalie, Pays des Grands Lacs, Guatemala, Salvador, Cambodge,

Afghanistan, G&eacute;orgie, Arm&eacute;nie, Azerba&iuml;djan.

<P>

<B>4. Evaluation de l'impact environnemental des projets et programmes

de d&eacute;veloppement</B>: le Conseil a eu une discussion politique

sur ce sujet mais n'a pas adopt&eacute; de r&eacute;solution.

Les ministres ont soulign&eacute; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de

prendre en compte le facteur environnement dans toute d&eacute;cision

ou mise en oeuvre des politiques, programmes ou projet de d&eacute;veloppement

et de recourir plus syst&eacute;matiquement &agrave; l'&eacute;valuation

d'impact environnemental avant l'approbation formelle des projets.

<P>

<B>5. Suite de la r&eacute;solution Horizon 2000</B>: dans le

cadre du suivi de la d&eacute;claration &quot;coop&eacute;ration

au d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; l'Horizon 2000&quot;, le Conseil

a d&eacute;battu: a) de la coordination op&eacute;rationnelle

&agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de l'exp&eacute;rience men&eacute;e

sur le terrain, sans adopter de conclusions toujours &agrave;

cause de la r&eacute;serve britannique; b) de la coh&eacute;rence

entre la politique de d&eacute;veloppement et des autres politiques

de la Communaut&eacute;, &agrave; la demande de la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation

danoise.

<P>

<B>6. Coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e</B>: le Conseil

a eu une discussion et approuvera d&egrave;s que possible des

conclusions.

<P>

<B>7. Migrations et d&eacute;veloppement</B>: le Conseil a d&eacute;battu

des liens entre certaines formes de l'assistance aux pays pauvres

et l'augmentation des flux migratoires. Les conclusions n'ont

pu &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;es.

<P>

<B>8. Pr&eacute;vention des conflits en Afrique</B>: sur la base

de la communication de la Commission, pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e

aux ministres par le Commissaire Pinheiro, le Conseil s'est montr&eacute;

tr&egrave;s largement favorable &agrave; l'approche de la Commission

pr&ocirc;nant une approche globale et volontariste qui int&egrave;gre

la pr&eacute;vention pr&eacute;coce des conflits violents dans

la politique de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de

l'UE.

<HR><BR>
<h1 align=center>From this month's editor</h1>

  There's been controversy on the editors' floor of this office ever since
I published a photo of myself in this space in my issue last year on an
<i>African Village</i> . I'd arranged for the village and its people to be captured
by the camera of our old friend Claude Sauvageot and he naturally took a
few pictures of me at work along the way.<BR>
<BR>
You will perhaps forgive me for having chosen the one which showed me in
the most flattering light. My co-workers, however, were unmerciful. 'The
first off-the-shoulder soft porn in the <b>NI</b>,' said one. 'He thinks he's bloody
Harrison Ford,' said another. More woundingly still: 'Who is this?', implying
that the care-ravaged, slouching apology for a man she saw crawling into
his desk every day bore no relation whatsoever to this artificial creation
of a world-class portrait photographer. The troupe of Hollywood beauticians
I took with me to Africa just to make this photo possible were of course
excluded from the frame.<BR>
<BR>
Since this is a photographic issue dedicated to documentary truth I thought
the record should be set straight. Here I reproduce again the offending
photo, purely in the interests of showing you the hideousness of my crime.
And along-side it is the unvarnished truth: a hitherto censored photo of
the journalist at work in that village in Burkina Faso. An unsavoury character:
sweaty, unshaven and with the most deeply furrowed brow in human history.<BR>
<BR>



The camera does not lie, they say. But we always edit and censor the truth
it provides. Even the greatest photographers are continually discarding
hundreds of pictures that do not show their subjects quite as they would
wish &shyp; or that do not meet their own artistic standards. For even in
the highly political areas explored by this magazine photography is an art.
A visual magazine on resistance around the world could very easily have
turned into a parade of rather tedious documentary photos showing demonstrators
waving placards. Instead the protesters and their stories have been brought
to life by the eye and appreciation of an artist for a different angle,
a quality of light, a special expression.<BR>
<BR>
This is the first photographic issue we have produced since we started printing
the magazine in full colour, a decision we originally took partly because
we felt monochrome images, for all their power, were giving no sense of
the cultural vibrancy and sheer bright colours of the South. Ironically
one of the main spin-offs of full-colour printing is that it makes high-quality
reproduction of black-and-white photographs much more possible &shyp; and,
paradoxically, black-and-whites can still often seem more 'realistic', somehow
more appropriate to social documentary. It is noticeable that all the Southern
photographers who have contributed to this issue have chosen to work in
black and white.<BR>
This is also probably one of the most positive magazines we have ever produced.
We are always keen to publish stories which show people standing up for
themselves, organizing against the forces which bear down on them. But this
issue has been a glorious excuse to focus on nothing but those examples
of active resistance. Gathering these pictures, hearing these stories, I
have felt my own spirits rise &shyp; the world may be in trouble but, hey,
the fight-back has begun.<BR>

<h2 align=center>Sensational fax shames the UN </h2>

On 11 January 1994, three months before the start of the genocide in Rwanda, the UN Commander in Kigali, General Romeo Dallaire, sent New York a coded cable. It revealed that 1,700 troops from the Interhamwe Hutu militia were in Kigali. They had access to arms and were boasting that they could kill 1,000 Tutsis in 20 minutes. The scene was set for a terrible outburst of brutality. General Dallaire called for intervention but the UN chose not to respond.<p>
 
  Details of this fax came to light in March this year in a damning report, The International Response to Conflict and Genocide, which criticised the UN and donor governments for not acting to prevent tragedy in Rwanda. The report also criticised the UN for pulling out its troops once the genocide began; and for being indecisive about sending reinforcements to protect civilians. While it praised the aid effort, which responded to a series of crises of massive proportions, it criticised several aid agencies, whose performance was not up to the highest standards of care. Oxfam (UK and Ireland) and M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;res were highlighted as two agencies that responded to the crises with skill and professionalism. <p>

 
  <i>'The International Response to Conflict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience' was prepared by international specialists under the aegis of the Danish government's aid department, DANIDA.</i>

<center><H2>Lom&#233; 2000</a><br><p>Beyond Lom&#233; IV: Exploring Options for Future ACP-EU Cooperation<br>Chapter 2 - Redefining Common Interests</H2><p></center>

<HR>

This report should be cited as: ECDPM. 1996. <i>Beyond Lom&#233; IV: Exploring Options for Future ACP-EU Cooperation</i>. (Policy Management Report No. 6). Maastricht: European Centre for Development Policy Management.

<p><hr><p>



<H3>Original Foundations No Longer Apply</H3>

<p>

<i>"This is not the time for status quo approaches. We need to redefine the rationale and

legitimacy of development cooperation beyond the provision of short-term emergency aid."

(Commission official)</i>.

<p>

These words by a European official are the starting point for any attempt to rethink ACP-EU

cooperation. The common interests that framed the original Convention and its instruments

no longer apply, or have shifted in importance. New interests (of both parties) have come

to the fore but are not adequately addressed  in the current Convention.

<p>

The ACP group is aware that it has lost much of its political and economic clout with the EU.

Europe's declining interest in Lom&#233; has been aptly captured by an ACP researcher

who says that the Convention is a "symbol of a period of colonialism that Europe would

prefer to forget [...]. As trading partners, the ACP states have been a clear failure and have

become less significant, politically and economically, with time." The ACP group  fears that

the EU has more pressing concerns and wants to abandon the Lom&#233; Convention

without fairly evaluating its development impact nor looking for suitable alternatives. It

appears to them that Europe is "searching for an elegant manner to divorce its ACP partner."

<p>

There is a growing awareness among the ACP that development cooperation faces a

legitimacy crisis. In most European countries, ministers of development cooperation face a

hard time defending aid budgets amidst domestic pressures to curb deficits and a major crisis

of the welfare state.  However, it should be noted that there is a strong desire in some ACP

countries to break with "aid dependency syndromes."

<p>

Many ACP people resent the fashionable panaceas of globalisation and liberalisation. They

fear that Europe will embrace this market ideology without proper consideration of its

development implications. This threatens the maintenance of several positive provisions of the

existing Convention that, according to some, have made "significant contributions to

alleviating poverty in ACP countries, to establishing and improving infrastructure and in some

notable cases to providing jobs through exports." 

<p>

What does all this mean for the debate on the future of ACP-EU cooperation? Basically, it

invites the different parties concerned to come up with convincing arguments to re-legitimise

development cooperation. This, in term implies a redefinition of the actual and potential

"common interests" between the ACP countries and the EU in the run-up to the year 2000.

This is a prerequisite for the revitalisation of ACP-EU cooperation.  

<p>

<h3>Can New Common Interests be Identified?</h3>

<p>

Two opposing views can be distilled:

<p>

According to a minority view (mainly held by European policy-makers and researchers) it is

no longer possible to find a solid "community of interests" between the ACP group and the

EU (perhaps with the exception of France). The political and economic foundations of the

partnership are particularly fragile. ACP countries are not vital partners for the supply of raw

materials, labour and services. They are not major outlets for exports nor do they attract

investments. Negative interdependencies (migration flows, drug trafficking, environmental

degradation) are perceived to be negligible. The remaining justification - humanitarian motives

- on its own is a shaky basis for future ACP-EU cooperation.

<p>

The majority view is less pessimistic. It acknowledges that the original foundations for ACP-

EU cooperation have been eroded. However, they argue that a community of interests can

still be defined. At the most basic level, cynics observe that the EU gets important returns

from its cooperation with the ACP. Hard evidence on the "flowback" is not readily available,

but there is a strong perception among the ACP that European companies, consultancy

bureaus, research institutes and experts, derive substantial benefits from Lom&#233;. Beyond

this narrow perspective of self-interest, many feel that "ethics" and "international solidarity"

remain a valid basis for cooperation. If properly used, they see development cooperation

helping to prevent decline and conflicts, narrowing the gap between rich and poor, and

creating decent living conditions in ACP countries. These goals are perceived to be also in

the (security) interests of the rich world and they suggest that the building blocks of a new

cooperation agreement can be found in these "negative interdependencies." Rather than

adopting a short-sighted attitude, the EU is well-advised to develop a comprehensive and

long-term strategy for international cooperation, including with regard to the 70 ACP

countries.

<p>

<h3>The Way Forward</h3>

<p>

At face value, the arguments used by the majority group make sense. However, in the current

political climate, it is doubtful whether they will suffice to revitalise ACP-EU cooperation.

Policy-making in Europe is obsessed with short-term domestic concerns. Exhortations for more

solidarity with the South are not likely to generate much response. If the ACP countries want

to strike a better deal with the EU, they will need to adopt a much more proactive approach.

They will have to convince politicians and public opinion  - with solid arguments and hard

evidence - of two things. First, that cooperation with the ACP countries is a legitimate

priority for the EU. Second, that this cooperation can be delivered in a transparent and

result-oriented manner. 

<p>

To this end, it is useful to de-construct the concept of "common interests" to see how it can

be given more "meat." Three options have been suggested:

<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center><h3>Redefining Common Interests</center></h3>

             Redefine Common Interests at Different Levels<br>

                  Integrate Private Common Interests<br>

            Redefine Common Interests in a Regional Perspective

</table></center>

<p><ul>

<li>Redefine common interests at different levels. This option argues that the concept of

common interests needs to be disaggregated and redefined at three levels -- foreign policy,

economic cooperation, and development cooperation. 

<ul><p>

<I>Foreign policy</I>. The prospects of new partnerships based on foreign policy considerations

look rather grim. It appears that the EU has no major geo-political interests to defend in

the ACP regions. However, it can be argued that Europe has security interests in

neighbouring Africa. It has little to win from political instability, conflicts and chaos that

require costly emergency and rehabilitation operations. Prevention, experience suggests,

is cheaper than the cure. This argument, however, makes less sense with regard to the

Caribbean and Pacific which, for many European policy-makers, are perceived to fall into

other geo-political settings.

<p>

<I>Economic cooperation</I>. At first sight, it is also difficult to see (new) common interests

emerging at the economic level. With the exception of some growth poles (such as

Southern Africa, francophone West-Africa, Mauritius), the ACP is seen as having only

marginal importance. On second analysis, however, this may be too narrow a view. Some

people argue that Europe does have a range of medium-term economic interests to

defend in Africa, the Caribbean and, to a lesser extent, in the Pacific. Africa, for instance,

has a potential market of half a billion people and it is richly endowed with strategic

resources. Europe's long-standing relationship with Africa gives it an advantage over other

economic powers. Surprisingly, investments from the US and Japan have increased

significantly in (Southern) Africa at a time when Europe seems to be adopting a wait and

see attitude (and is even withdrawing). 

<p>

People in the Caribbean claim that the potential for economic cooperation remains

largely untapped. Joint ventures could be established in new growth areas (such as

tourism, environment, services) and among a wide variety of European and Caribbean

actors (much beyond the present scope of government-to-government relations). Moves

towards reciprocity may give a further boost to expanding trade relations and investments.

The Caribbean has "a vital stake in safeguarding a diversified political and economic

cooperation with Europe, amongst others to avoid an exclusive dependency from the US

and Latin America." In return, it can offer Europe "a pathway to emerging regional

markets in the hemisphere." Even in the Pacific, Europe may have some strategic

economic interests to defend (sea-bed resources, tourism, environmental protection).

With limited amounts of funding, the EU can have a high profile in the Pacific. These

examples suggest that there needs to be well-documented research to articulate actual and

potential economic interests between the EU and the ACP in a medium and long-term

perspective.

<P>                          

<I>Development Cooperation</I>. It is less problematic to identify shared common interests in

development cooperation. In the Maastricht Treaty, the EU has committed itself to

ambitious development objectives. These priorities are perfectly in line with the

development needs of the ACP group -- which harbours a majority of the world's poorest

countries. In this context, it is argued that the debate on the future of ACP-EU

cooperation is really about the issue of "globalisation" versus "development."   Very few

people argue about the central role of markets. Yet, beyond this point, many questions

remain unanswered. How to ensure a smooth and gradual integration of weaker and

poorer developing countries in the global market economy? How to prevent the

marginalisation of most ACP countries? Or, as an ACP Ambassador put it: "What

"judicious mix of policies and effective measures are needed to address the problems of

a large section of the world's poor?"

</ul><p>                                       

<li>Integrate private common interests. In the past, public interests - pertaining to

governments - have dominated the Lom&#233; partnership. In an attempt to redefine

common interests, it is critical to also include the interests of the private sector and civil

society -- both in the ACP and in Europe. For instance, with the gradual "opening-up"

of societies in Africa, the seeds have been sown for a dynamic private sector (in Kenya

and Ivory Coast for instance). In the absence of a European response, these private

operators are turning to Japan and the Middle East. It would be short-sighted if the EU

would not see its mid-term interest in these emerging markets. Establishing linkages with

these private interests may help to promote joint ventures between actors in North and

South. 

<p>

<li>Redefine common interests in a regional perspective. The proponents of this option

argue that it would be much easier to redefine common interests on a region-by-region

basis rather than through the overall ACP umbrella. In their view, it makes little sense to

lump 70 heterogeneous countries together. This leads to a very poor definition of

common interests (based on the lowest common denominator or on a bewildering variety

of disparate interests), disconnected from the specific needs of each region. It also

induces the EU to adopt standard policies and approaches.

<p>

These weaknesses could be avoided by adopting a regional approach. In the Caribbean

for example, there are no major problems of governance and democracy that jeopardise

cooperation with the EU. Most countries are primarily interested in developing a new

trade partnership with the EU, based on a gradual introduction of reciprocity and support

for the painful process of export diversification. A process of regional integration is slowly

taking place, involving other Caribbean countries that are not associated to Lom&#233;.

All these factors seem to justify the need for a new cooperation agreement, to be

negotiated on a regional basis. This would allow for a much more sound and solid

partnership, anchored on mutually agreed common interests. For detailed discussion on

this issue of regional differentiation, <a href="pmr63_gb.htm">see chapter 3</a>.

Now 10 years old, the four-day meeting on3-6 April in <a href="#geneva">Geneva* </a>offers some 120 films for viewing, alldealing with developing countries or development. But at thesame time, the Rencontres is organizing nine hours of debate onthe future of the United Nations, bringing in experts andcommentators who have put forward proposals for reform. By <b>Peter Hulm.</b></i><hr>The festival takes place in April because it used to be held inthe University of Geneva and that's when the University goes onholiday so the meeting rooms are available. <i>Rencontres MediasNord-Sud (RMNS)</i> is that sort of event. You won't find Coordinator TinaBoillat making grandiose assertions about its ambitions or itsimpact. The most she will claim is that "it is really four daysof dialogue". But RMNS (international Geneva makes you want toslip into a comfortable acronym as soon as you decently can) hasbuilt itself a solid reputation as a place for independent filmmakers to meet people from the television organizations(including buyers), and particularly for Third World directorsto show their wares. Tuesday morning, for example, on Africaoffers films from Niger, Iran, Togo, Madagascar, Sweden (onAfrica), Togo, Switzerland (Rwanda), France (AIDS in Africa) andArte (a personal African story) in quick succession.<p>The meeting's gradual and continuous evolution makes it difficultto describe anything about RMNS as being fixed: this year'ssessions take place for the first time in the Maison des Arts duGrutli and Fonction:Cinema is now a co-organizer. But howsignificant is this? It testifies more to the organizers' skillat using whatever opportunity comes up to strengthen support forthe event and make it better known. "We first went to the Valaisduring the 700th anniversary celebrations the SwissConfederation in 1991, because the authorities there were givenresponsibility for the audio-visual side of the event and wantedto do something about Switzerland's relations with the world,"explains Boillat.<p>The Grutli is Geneva's Cinetheque, and so (for the second time)RMNS is showing some of the films to the general public: "One ofaims is to make these films known, particularly the work ofindependents," Boillat stresses. "These people are making verygood films -- often better than the conventional companies --and they depend on events like ours."<p>Boillat, who took over the coordinating job five years ago afterhelping out before, sees one major change in the number of womenmaking documentaries in the Third World. "There are now manywomen directors, making films in incredible conditions," shesays. "A woman from Burkina Faso who has now become a regular atthe Rencontres was forced to edit her first film at nightbecause the facilities were reserved for the news broadcastersduring the day."<p>This year RMNS received more than 90 applicants for thecompetition for independent film-makers (of CHF4,000/over$3000), and finally accepted 39. Another 35 entries came frommainstream TV.  Recent winners of the top award (CHF5,000), theGeneva International Television Prize, have been <i>Battle of theTitans </i>by Danmarks Radio (1994), Central Television's <i>War byOther Means </i>(1993), Central Television's <i>Rivers of Sand </i>(1992),and Channel 4's <i>Lessons of Exile </i>(1991). This is not afrancophone/development event that practices linguisticchauvinism or UN political correctness through geographicdistribution of its rewards.<p>But, conversely, how many of the independent prizewinners havewe seen on Northern screens?  <i>Profissao:Domestica </i>by CECIP,Brazil, won the 1994 South-North Prize. INA (France)'s <i>La FlacaAlejandra </i>won the Independents' Prize. In 1993 the winners were<i>L'acces des femmes   la terre </i>(Burkina Faso) and TVE's <i>Lucia. </i>In1992 the Sud-Nord prize went to Colombia's <i>Saranda de sue os,</i>and in 1991 to Brazil's <i>Verde Verdade.</i><p>The chances are you haven't seen more than one or two. "I don'tthink that [rich world television stations] are taking less[from developing countries]," says Boillat. "They have nevertaken films from the South. But I'm sure that if buyers from theNorth saw these films they would buy them immediately. Thechallenge is to let them know what is available."<p><a name="geneva"></a><b>* There's a fifth day of ceremonies and showings in St Maurice(Valais) on 7 April.</b><p><hr>Contact: Tina Boillat, Coordinatrice, <a href="crosslines_rmns.html">Rencontres MediasNord-Sud, </a>Television suisse Romande, Case postale 234, CH-1211Geneva 8, Switzerland.

<h1>Kings of the water</h1>



<font size=+1>River water has been critical to the making of human history. This is especially true for the people who have lived in deserts since the dawn of human civilization. Some of the most elaborate works of river engineering and the social structures needed to support them have been established to maintain life under hostile dryland conditions. NI traces the promise and the pitfalls of  hydraulic societies both ancient and modern.</font>


<h3>Subsistence
Agriculture</h3>


Irrigation is almost as old as agriculture itself. It was practised on a small scale to grow food for local consumption (and even surplus). Elaborate canal systems to water the crops of the Papago or 'bean people' allowed these native Americans to survive some of  the harshest conditions of the Sonoran desert. Intricate systems of small reservoirs or qanats and spring tunnels were used to capture 
precious run-off in a belt stretching from Palestine to Iran. The lighter the touch in dealing with delicate dryland eco-systems the better the chance of avoiding waterlogging or salt-poisoning of fertile topsoils. Today such locally-controlled irrigation is still in operation from the rice fields of Bali to the 100,000-odd irrigation co-operatives that dot the Japanese countryside.




<h3>Oriental 
Despotism</h3>

Larger-scale irrigation systems are intergrally tied to the development of the absolutist state that came to dominate small villages in the valleys of major rivers from the Tigres-Euphrates to the Yangtze and Yellow rivers of China. The state itself arose in the drylands of the Middle East where it co-ordinated the major works of irrigation and water control. The trade-off was simple: dependable water supply and relative safety from floods for tribute, labour and obedience. Huge armies of labourers had to be mobilized first to build and then to maintain elaborate systems of dikes and irrigation canals. The Nilometer (below) measured the Nile's crucial flood - 16 cubits was ideal. Religions of sacrifice and the worship of river gods - Isis and Hapi on the Nile, Ninurta in Mesopotamia and Ganga in ancient India - were part of the cosmology of a ruling priesthood. The bending of rivers to human will occurred at the same time as bending the will of the many to the dictates of the few. Today most of their great water works lie in ruins.


<h3>The Mystical Source</h3>



For the European culture of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment the sources of the world's great rivers took on a symbolic and metaphoric importance. The source of the Nile in particular became associated with everything from the Garden of Eden and the Horn of Plenty to the nourishment of political liberty. The fountains of Bernini made use of ornamental water hydraulics that were later to shape modern engineering and featured classical figures of crouched or reclining (but always well-muscled) river gods of four continents. Early European explorers such as Sir Walter Raleigh were obsessed by the idea that rivers of the New World (such as the Orinoco) would lead them to the gold of an elusive El Dorado. In later literature writers like Joseph Conrad used the river as inspiration to explore the journey into the human psyche.




<h3>Dams for 
Development</h3>

This model of a prosperous US West has bewitched modernizers around the world and led to an era of large dam construction starting in the early 1960s.  Generally dam-building and large irrigation projects came to be seen as progressive steps in the march to independence. The High Aswan Dam across the Nile (entrance pictured above) completed in 1964 with Soviet help, was a symbol of Third World independence from neo-colonial control. Since then the Volta, the Zambesi, the Ganges, the Indas, the Paranai are just a few of the great rivers of the Third World breached to supply dependable water for irrigation and the voltage necessary to jolt an industrial take-off. A powerful consortium of nationalist politicians, multilateral lenders and transnational engineering and construction firms have reshaped river eco-systems as a vital part of industrial infrastructure. Advantages and wealth for some came right away, except to those uprooted from their homes (four million at last count), costs have been slower to accumulate. The curse of salted and waterlogged fields, coastal erosion, ruined fisheries, staggering debt, and escalating repair bills are just now beginning to hit home.    



<h3>Cadillac 
Desert</h3>

The Western notion of the river mirrored first in the great Roman aqueducts was a linear highway to be shaped by destination and purpose. European rivers such as the Rhine have been heavily engineered mostly to accommodate shipping. But modern hydraulic society reached its highest expression in the American West. Here a vast wilderness was flooded with settlers looking for the promised land and finding mostly arid and semi-arid desert. Many went to the wall before billion-dollar investments in water infrastructure made the desert bloom. The Mormons led the way with a rigid theocracy directing the irrigation of Utah. By the 1930s the construction of the Hoover Dam on the wayward Colorado River initiated the era of the mega-dam. Today California's Imperial Valley, one of the world's great food-producing regions, and thirsty and energy-hungry desert metropolises such as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas are lavish testimony to the taming of the Colorado, Columbia and myriad other Western rivers. 

<h3>Respecting the River</h3>


Dam sites these days are usually surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. With good reason. The movement to resist river engineering has gained real momentum in the last decade. In the industrial North dams are becoming almost as controversial as nuclear power plants. Costs and environmental impacts undergo minute scrutiny. The number of new dams has fallen dramatically. In the South resistance has proved more difficult with Ôresettled' farmers and green activists getting blows from police truncheons rather than seats at assessment hearings. Still some notable victories have been achieved - a number of dams have been stopped in Thailand, the corruption-ridden Bangladesh Flood Action Plan has been scaled back dramatically and the World Bank has been forced to withdraw from several mega-dam projects on the Indian sub-continent. And the movement is putting alternatives on the agenda - energy development that works with a river rather than trying to reshape and conquer it. Traditional small-scale methods of irrigation are also being revived, from Karez in Western China (small-scale water catchment) to the stone lines used in arid Sahelian Africa and the rebuilding of age-old raised fields to aid drainage by the Quechua Indian farmers near Lake Titicaca in Peru.

<i>Letter from this month's editor</i>
<hr width=80%><p>

<font size=+2>T</font>he doctor knelt at eye-level with my genitalia. My father, surprised, remarked that his little boy was growing up, a reference to my new-sprung pubic hair. Before the doctor came I had asked my mother - a former nurse - if I would have to take my pyjamas off. I had prepared to die of embarrassment. <p>

Strangely, the doctor's concern dispelled all that and the examination took on a curious air of display, as though my little life had shrugged off its cares and distractions and stood naked under a spotlight, awaiting judgement.<p>

'It's acute appendicitis,' said the doctor. Magic words. Days after the operation I would tell my friends at school: 'It was really <i>acute.'</i>
In no time I was whisked off, still in my pyjamas, to the local nursing home by two very worried parents. They were justifiably worried. Before 

I came into this world a legendary uncle had died of a ruptured appendix. He had been a handsome young man with pomaded hair. On my way to the nursing home I wondered whether one day my nieces and nephews would look at a sepia photograph of an uncle whose life had been tragically cut short. You could say my fantasy life was pretty dramatic back then.<p>

Once settled in my new bed I resisted all efforts at sedation. The doctor who would be operating on me came to have a look - he was a broad man with great jowls who was more interested in talking to my parents than to me. Eventually, when I refused to go to sleep, a nurse tempted me with a walk around the place, and before I knew it I had walked into the operating theatre and was being counted out.<p>

Afterwards I would beg for sedation as the pain became too much. 
A steady stream of relatives, including a glamorous cousin who had just become an air hostess, came visiting with gifts and nothing but praise. This warm glow lasted until my stitches came out. <p>

Then I saw with horror the scar - four inches in length, just under my navel. It was red and gross like an oversized worm. Damn, I'd never make it as a film star because I wouldn't be able to take my shirt off. I informed the doctor, quite solemnly, that he had ruined my sex appeal. My parents were disappointed too that I had been split apart for a fairly common  surgical procedure. 'He's nothing but a horse doctor,' my mother muttered under her breath.<p>
 
 Since then I have encountered much doctoring, good and bad, but it is the memory of my operation that prompted me to do this magazine. Of course  this issue is packed with the usual, wide-ranging NI mix and there's actually very little of 'a funny thing happened on my way to the hospital'  in it. So I thought I'd get it in here! <p>

 The scar will always be with me. It's become quite a cherished part of my   anatomy now. It marks the spot where medicine entered into me and saved my life. <p>

<A NAME="abs"><h3>Abstract:</h3><P></A>

<H3>Euro-latinamerican relations and the process of european regional

integration</H3>

<P>

The evolution of the relations between the current European Union

and Latin America is framed within the complex system of policies

and instruments which allowed the Community to gain access to

its present status in the international context and which serve

as a reference in the attempt to advance in the process of rapprochement.

The limits of the Community powers in foreign policy and its regional

focus are some key elements which condition any advance in the

field of future prospection.

<a name=int><h3>Introducci&#243;n</h3>

<b>Una perspectiva europea</b> </P>

<P>

En el mar de flujos y reflujos del reciente devenir hist&oacute;rico

en las relaciones euro-latinoam&eacute;ricanas, la construcci&oacute;n

de la integraci&oacute;n europea constituye una marea de fondo

que ha dominado el di&aacute;logo. La evoluci&oacute;n de estos

contactos queda necesariamente enmarcada en el complejo de pol&iacute;ticas

e instrumentos que permitieron a la Comunidad Europea (CE) acceder

a su actual estatuto en el contexto internacional. </P>

<P>

La pol&iacute;tica exterior de la CE, como su misma construcci&oacute;n,

se ciment&oacute; sobre dos pilares: la cesi&oacute;n de competencias

estables por medio de Acuerdos Internacionales y la cl&aacute;usula

evolutiva, que permite una progresiva asunci&oacute;n de competencias

en la medida necesaria para una &oacute;ptima consecuci&oacute;n

de los objetivos del Tratado fundacional. Surgi&oacute; as&iacute;

una correlaci&oacute;n entre el fundamento jur&iacute;dico de

las competencias comunitarias y la extensi&oacute;n material de

&eacute;stas(Groux/Manin,1985) y aqu&eacute;l condicion&oacute;

los instrumentos utilizados para formalizar una determinada obligaci&oacute;n

internacional, de modo que observar los instrumentos jur&iacute;dicos

empleados en las relaciones con Am&eacute;rica Latina (AL) sirve

de prospecci&oacute;n sobre el grado de profundizaci&oacute;n

adquirido. </P>

<P>

Adicionalmente y al paso de sucesivas ampliaciones, la Comunidad

instituy&oacute; unos esquemas de relaci&oacute;n regional selectivos

en funci&oacute;n de prioridades consensuadas por el conjunto

de Estados miembros. Entre los pa&iacute;ses en v&iacute;as de

desarrollo (PVD), AL atrajo inicialmente s&oacute;lo un modesto

inter&eacute;s respecto al de las antiguas colonias de los pa&iacute;ses

miembros y tampoco pod&iacute;a competir con las perspectivas

comerciales de los pa&iacute;ses industrializados o las expectativas

m&aacute;s recientes de la Europa del Este y el Magreb. Este papel

secundario plane&oacute; incluso en los escogidos momentos de

entendimiento posteriores. </P>

<P>

Para hacer un an&aacute;lisis global en perspectiva hist&oacute;rica,

recurrimos a una doble estructuraci&oacute;n de las relaciones.

En corte vertical se distinguen tres &aacute;mbitos materiales:

el pol&iacute;tico-diplom&aacute;tico, las relaciones econ&oacute;mico-comerciales

y la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo, con evoluciones diversas

pero relacionadas entre s&iacute;, de manera que de la comparaci&oacute;n

se pueden destilar las principales tendencias. En horizontal se

establece una divisi&oacute;n en per&iacute;odos que tiene en

cuenta la progresividad de la pol&iacute;tica exterior de la Comunidad,

pues cualquier intento de periodizar ha de enmarcarse en dicho

proceso de ensanchamiento material paulatino y constre&ntilde;irse

a los instrumentos disponibles. </P>

<P>

<a name =1958></a><h3>1958-70: El per&#237;odo inicial de la construcci&#243;n europea</h3> </P>

<P>

La debutante Comunidad Econ&oacute;mica Europea (CEE) estaba en

fase de afianzamiento como actor de las relaciones internacionales

y carec&iacute;a de instrumentos jur&iacute;dicos para la institucionalizaci&oacute;n

del di&aacute;logo con AL, limit&aacute;ndose los contactos a

simples reuniones protocolarias entre embajadores o altos funcionarios,

sin capacidad para modificar la situaci&oacute;n mientras persistiesen

las inc&oacute;gnitas a la hora de designar un interlocutor v&aacute;lido.

</P>

<P>

<B>Los primeros contactos</B> </P>

<P>

En los a&ntilde;os iniciales se produjeron incipientes declaraciones

en favor del establecimiento de mejores relaciones, como el primer

<I>Memor&aacute;ndum sobre las relaciones con Am&eacute;rica Latina</I>

de mayo de 1958, que invitaba a una colaboraci&oacute;n fundada

en el respeto de los derechos de cada una de las dos partes interesadas

y sobre la base de ventajas rec&iacute;procas. En enero de 1963

se consider&oacute; aplicar ciertas reducciones en la tarifa aduanera

com&uacute;n frente a productos latinoamericanos en atenci&oacute;n

a su condici&oacute;n de PVD y posibles modalidades de ayuda al

desarrollo, lo cual fu&eacute; fruto de la asistencia de la Comisi&oacute;n

a la Conferencia de Punta del Este, donde los dirigentes latinoamericanos

discut&iacute;an sus estrategias frente al mercado internacional.

Como resultado, el Consejo cre&oacute; un grupo de contacto con

competencias limitadas, que exclu&iacute;an expresamente la negociaci&oacute;n

y se circunscrib&iacute;an al intercambio de informaciones. </P>

<P>

Tras un lustro de est&eacute;riles reuniones informativas, el

Gobierno italiano entreg&oacute; al Consejo un memor&aacute;ndum

que auspiciaba la creaci&oacute;n de una comisi&oacute;n de contacto

de car&aacute;cter permanente y el establecimiento de un mecanismo

de coordinaci&oacute;n de las acciones de los Estados miembros

en el campo de la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica y de la integraci&oacute;n

regional. Aunque el Consejo lleg&oacute; a proponer la creaci&oacute;n

de una comisi&oacute;n mixta, &eacute;sta no llegar&iacute;a a

concretarse, por el cansancio derivado de la ausencia de resultados

concretos, suma de la falta de interlocutor estable por parte

latinoamericana y la precariedad temporal de los contactos causada

por el sistema de autorizaciones limitadas del Consejo. </P>

<P>

Durante estos a&ntilde;os las relaciones ni tan siquiera deber&iacute;an

calificarse de multilaterales ya que, mientras los pa&iacute;ses

de AL trataban de conseguir un di&aacute;logo directo con los

Estados miembros, &eacute;ste era evitado tanto por &eacute;stos,

para impedir cualquier viso de negociaci&oacute;n con consecuencias

jur&iacute;dicas, como por la comisi&oacute;n, que buscaba reforzar

su representatividad en la arena internacional (Marchisio, 1983).

</P>

<P>

<B>El establecimiento del mercado com&uacute;n</B> </P>

<P>

Al ser las pol&iacute;ticas comercial y econ&oacute;mica las competencias

m&aacute;s tempranamente transferidas de forma exclusiva a la

Comunidad, Latinoam&eacute;rica expres&oacute; r&aacute;pidamente

sus inquietudes sobre los perjuicios que pudieran derivarse de

la implantaci&oacute;n de una tarifa aduanera com&uacute;n para

sus exportaciones ya que, en lo inmediato, supon&iacute;a una

merma en su capacidad de negociaci&oacute;n bilateral para mantener

sus mercados tradicionales en cada pa&iacute;s miembro de la CEE,

implicando enfrentarse a la disciplina de consenso que impone

el proceso de toma de decisiones comunitario. Pero los mayores

recelos eran frente al blindaje del mercado europeo que supon&iacute;a

el establecimiento de la Pol&iacute;tica Agraria Com&uacute;n

(PAC) (Grilli,1993). </P>

<P>

En ausencia de acuerdos comerciales bilaterales, los intercambios

mercantiles se regularon en los foros multilaterales, tanto en

la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas para el Comercio y el Desarrollo

(UNCTAD) como en el Acuerdo General sobre Aranceles y comercio

(GATT). Durante los debates surgidos a ra&iacute;z de las propuestas

comerciales lanzadas por los PVD a trav&eacute;s del Grupo de

los 77, la CEE, aunque se manifest&oacute; en favor de la estabilizaci&oacute;n

de los precios de los productos b&aacute;sicos, acab&oacute; decant&aacute;ndose

por la negociaci&oacute;n de materias primas producto por producto,

estableciendo distintos grados de liberalizaci&oacute;n y distintos

plazos. Tras la aprobaci&oacute;n en diciembre de 1964 del nuevo

cap&iacute;tulo IV del GATT <I>Comercio y Desarrollo</I>, que

establec&iacute;a los principios de estabilizacion de los precios

de los productos b&aacute;sicos, la no reciprocidad en las concesiones

a los PVD y el mantenimiento del statu quo en las tarifas vigentes,

el Consejo acord&oacute; suspender total o parcialmente de forma

unilateral, la tarifa aduanera com&uacute;n de determinados productos,

entre los que se encontraban algunos de inter&eacute;s para AL.

</P>

<P>

La ausencia de resultados obtenidos por v&iacute;a interregional

y los avatares que azotaban los intentos de consolidaci&oacute;n

de los sistemas de integraci&oacute;n latinoamericanos, inclin&oacute;

a los pa&iacute;ses con mayor potencial econ&oacute;mico (Argentina,

Brasil y Uruguay) a hacer uso de su iniciativa individual para

defender sus intereses en el seno del GATT, postura insolidaria

que a la larga debilitar&iacute;a su posici&oacute;n negociadora

global. </P>

<P>

<B>Primeros pasos de la Cooperaci&oacute;n para el Desarrollo</B>

</P>

<P>

Las competencias limitadas de la CEE determinaron una relaci&oacute;n

con los PVD en una doble vertiente: la participaci&oacute;n de

la Comunidad en el contexto general de la cooperaci&oacute;n para

el desarrollo, y la relativa al sistema de cooperaci&oacute;n

para el desarrollo establecida en el marco de la CEE, que en esta

primera etapa qued&oacute; circunscrita a la inclusi&oacute;n

en el Tratado CEE (TCEE) del acuerdo de asociaci&oacute;n para

las ex colonias y a la participaci&oacute;n en la Primera Convenci&oacute;n

sobre Ayuda Alimentaria de 1967. </P>

<P>

<a name=1970></a><h3>1970-79: Primera ampliaci&#243;n comunitaria y formalizaci&#243;n de las relaciones interregionales</h3> </P>

<P>

La adhesi&oacute;n de Dinamarca, Irlanda y el Reino Unido abri&oacute;

el debate, hasta entonces obviado por influencia francesa, sobre

las relaciones externas de la Comunidad, centr&aacute;ndolo en

la propuesta brit&aacute;nica de globalizar la pol&iacute;tica

de cooperaci&oacute;n con los PVD que concern&iacute;a a la ubicaci&oacute;n

de la Comunidad en el mundo. Esta preocupaci&oacute;n qued&oacute;

recogida en las Actas de la Cumbre de 1972 en Par&iacute;s, que

inaugur&oacute; la <I>dimensi&oacute;n mundialista </I>de la cooperaci&oacute;n

para sintonizar el aumento de la influencia de la CEE tras la

ampliaci&oacute;n con su presencia internacional. </P>

<P>

<B>La b&uacute;squeda del interlocutor regional</B> </P>

<P>

Tras el fracaso del primer di&aacute;logo, los pa&iacute;ses de

la Comisi&oacute;n Especial de Coordinaci&oacute;n Latinoamericana

(CECLA) trataron de definir una pol&iacute;tica com&uacute;n resumida

en la <I>Declaraci&oacute;n de Buenos Aires</I> de 1970 con la

que se propuso oficialmente a la comisi&oacute;n la institucionalizaci&oacute;n

del di&aacute;logo. &#131;sta inst&oacute; al Consejo a convocar

una conferencia interministerial que acab&oacute; reducida a una

reuni&oacute;n entre los embajadores de AL, la comisi&oacute;n

y el comit&eacute; de representantes permanentes de los Estados

miembros de la CEE (COREPER). </P>

<P>

La primera declaraci&oacute;n com&uacute;n defini&oacute; las

l&iacute;neas directrices de la negociaci&oacute;n priorizando

la b&uacute;squeda de soluciones a los problemas comerciales con

f&oacute;rmulas preferenciales para aumentar y diversificar los

intercambios. Estas reuniones continuaron con periodicidad irregular

hasta 1979, a&ntilde;o en que se interrumpieron por la incorporaci&oacute;n

de Cuba al Grupo Latinoam&eacute;ricano de embajadores ante la

CEE (GRULA). </P>

<P>

En 1976 se cre&oacute; el Sistema Econ&oacute;mico Latinoamericano

(SELA), uno de cuyos objetivos era la coordinaci&oacute;n de la

posici&oacute;n de sus miembros en los c&iacute;rculos internacionales.

El SELA mantuvo posturas combativas frente a la pol&iacute;tica

comercial comunitaria y lleg&oacute; a plantear la necesidad de

arbitrar medidas coordinadas de <I>tratamiento sim&eacute;trico</I>

al proteccionismo que aplicaba la CEE. </P>

<P>

Abriendo v&iacute;as de acercamiento, Bogot&aacute; vio nacer

en 1974 las Conferencias entre representantes del Parlamento Europeo

(PE) y parlamentarios de los Estados latinoamericanos. &#131;stas

continuaron celebr&aacute;ndose bianualmente y aunque su trascendencia

pr&aacute;ctica fue escasa, debido al limitado poder de decisi&oacute;n

de la instituci&oacute;n parlamentaria europea, sirvieron para

despertar una sensibilidad favorable a los problemas latinoam&eacute;ricanos

especialmente entre fuerzas pol&iacute;ticas afines. </P>

<P>

<B>Acuerdos, preferencias y restricciones comerciales</B> </P>

<P>

Los cuatro primeros acuerdos comerciales bilaterales firmados

entre la CEE y pa&iacute;ses de AL se negociaron durante el primer

lustro de la d&eacute;cada: el primero con Argentina en 1971 y

dos a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s tarde con Uruguay, s&oacute;lo cuatro

meses antes que el celebrado con Brasil en 1974. Estos tres acuerdos

tienen casi id&eacute;ntico contenido, limitado a las materias

previstas expresamente en los art&iacute;culos 111 y 113 del TCEE.

El cuarto, firmado con M&eacute;xico en julio de 1975, anunciaba

un nuevo tipo de convenio m&aacute;s ambicioso, dirigido al conjunto

de pa&iacute;ses no asociados que a pesar de no ofrecer cambios

cualitativos de contenido material, s&iacute; mejoraba aspectos

institucionales. Se trataba de acuerdos no preferenciales con

el tratamiento de la naci&oacute;n m&aacute;s favorecida, regla

general del GATT que disfrutan todos sus miembros. </P>

<P>

Dado el escaso alcance de los acuerdos, la regulaci&oacute;n multilateral

continu&oacute; siendo la base principal de las transacciones

comerciales, aunque matizada por la condici&oacute;n de PVD de

las econom&iacute;as latinoamericanas y las pol&iacute;ticas proteccionistas.

En noviembre de 1970, en respuesta a la <I>Declaraci&oacute;n

de Buenos Aires</I>, el Consejo aprob&oacute; un reglamento acelerando

algunas concesiones resultantes de las negociaciones de la Ronda

Kenedy y, posteriormente, las negociaciones de la Ronda Tokio

(1974-1979) consiguieron algunos progresos. Al mismo tiempo, siete

pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos optaron por negociar <I>acuerdos

de autolimitaci&oacute;n voluntaria</I> del textil en lugar de

coordinar sus posiciones; con la crisis del sector sider&uacute;rgico

se lleg&oacute; a nuevos acuerdos de autolimitaci&oacute;n, inducidos

por la Comunidad mediante un uso muy severo de la regulaci&oacute;n

<I>antidumping</I> y antisubvenciones, y siguieron las limitaciones

en los productos artesanos e incluso materias primas como carne

de cordero y cabra o la mandioca. Al no tratar de contribuir al

incremento de los intercambios sino de restringirlos, estos acuerdos

se planteaban como una medida provisional y transitoria, pero

con tendencia a la perpetuaci&oacute;n en la pr&aacute;ctica a

trav&eacute;s de sucesivas reconducciones y con el agravante de

que se aplicaban frente a cualquier competidor sin considerar

su nivel de desarrollo. </P>

<P>

En sentido opuesto, la Comunidad puso en vigor, a partir de julio

de 1971, el Sistema de Preferencias Generalizadas (SPG), con objeto

de permitir un aumento de los ingresos por importaci&oacute;n

de los PVD y el fortalecimiento de su industria, tal y como hab&iacute;a

sido recomendado por la UNCTAD. Con el tiempo se constat&oacute;

que los PVD de mayor desarrollo eran los que m&aacute;s aprovechaban

el sistema; Brasil, M&eacute;xico y Argentina eran los &uacute;nicos

pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos que figuraban entre los 10 principales

beneficiarios. La burocratizaci&oacute;n, la poca transparencia

y la falta de previsibilidad del sistema dificult&oacute; su aplicaci&oacute;n.

</P>

<P>

<B>La globalizaci&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n</B>

</P>

<P>

El cambio fundamental fue la evoluci&oacute;n desde un concepto

de cooperaci&oacute;n estrechamente ligado a la relaci&oacute;n

postcolonial, hacia un campo m&aacute;s amplio, inserto en el

&aacute;mbito de las relaciones exteriores de la propia Comunidad

(Abell&aacute;n,1992). A las pol&iacute;ticas regionales ya iniciadas

con los pa&iacute;ses de &ccedil;frica-Caribe-Pac&iacute;fico

(ACP) y de la Cuenca Mediterr&aacute;nea, se a&ntilde;adieron

dos instrumentos dirigidos a los PVD en general e inspirados en

el surgimiento de una Pol&iacute;tica de Cooperaci&oacute;n comunitaria.

</P>

<P>

La evoluci&oacute;n qued&oacute; dibujada en una serie de documentos

program&aacute;ticos; previamente a la ampliaci&oacute;n, la Comisi&oacute;n

envi&oacute; al Consejo las <I>Orientaciones de una pol&iacute;tica

de Cooperaci&oacute;n al Desarrollo </I>seguidas del Programa

de Acci&oacute;n donde se evidencia la <I>doble orientaci&oacute;n</I>

(Sobrino, J.M., 1985) de la Pol&iacute;tica de Cooperaci&oacute;n

comunitaria. Debido a la escasez de medios disponibles se manten&iacute;a

la regionalizaci&oacute;n selectiva, pero completada mediante

acciones en el &aacute;mbito mundial con PVD no asociados, siguiendo

las recomendaciones de la UNCTAD y la Asamblea General de la ONU.

</P>

<P>

El Primer programa de acci&oacute;n en favor de los PVD no asociados

para el per&iacute;odo 1976-1980 se estableci&oacute; gracias

a las presiones ejercidas por Reino Unido, que bloque&oacute;

la aprobaci&oacute;n de las cantidades de ayuda dirigidas a los

pa&iacute;ses ACP hasta que no se decidiese esta aportaci&oacute;n.

Se trataba de ayudas no reembolsables destinadas a los pa&iacute;ses

m&aacute;s necesitados, con un enfoque de car&aacute;cter asistencial

dirigido al aumento de la producci&oacute;n alimentaria y a potenciar

el desarrollo de las regiones rurales. La distribuci&oacute;n

fu&eacute; de un 75% para Asia, un 20% para Am&eacute;rica Latina

y un 5% para pa&iacute;ses africanos no asociados. </P>

<P>

La crisis alimentaria mundial a principios de los setenta provoc&oacute;

un aumento de los precios de los cereales en el mercado mundial

y estimul&oacute; un r&aacute;pido crecimiento del presupuesto

dedicado a ayuda alimentaria. La ayuda comunitaria se dividi&oacute;

en dos: la ayuda de urgencia para paliar situaciones cr&iacute;ticas

y la ayuda alimentaria normal. En 1971 se cre&oacute; un segundo

fondo para la ayuda de emergencia a los pa&iacute;ses no cubiertos

por el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo (FED), al que en 1972 se a&ntilde;adir&iacute;a

un fondo de ayuda alimentaria de emergencia para v&iacute;ctimas

de desastres y grupos vulnerables en los PVD. La participaci&oacute;n

de AL en la ayuda de emergencia s&oacute;lo fue de un 10%, dada

su mejor situaci&oacute;n respecto a Asia y &ccedil;frica. En

cambio, su participaci&oacute;n en la l&iacute;nea presupuestar&iacute;a

de ayuda a trav&eacute;s de Organizaciones No Gubernamentales

(ONG), que se inici&oacute; a partir de 1976, fue en torno al

25% del total debido a la amplia cultura occidental existente

en Latinoam&eacute;rica, que facilita el contacto directo de la

poblaci&oacute;n civil, y el hecho de trabajar con las clases

m&aacute;s desfavorecidas, que deja al margen los &iacute;ndices

macroecon&oacute;micos (Granda-Mate-Moreno, 1988). </P>

<P>

En general, durante toda esta d&eacute;cada, la participaci&oacute;n

de la regi&oacute;n latinoamericana en la Cooperaci&oacute;n de

la CEE fue muy reducida, en un promedio del 2,7% entre 1970 y

1977, pero aument&oacute; a partir del agudizamiento de la crisis

de Centroam&eacute;rica (CA) que condujo a un aumento de los recursos

enviados a dicha subregi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

<a name=1980></a><h3>1980-89: Politizaci&#243;n y regionalizaci&#243;n de las relaciones</h3> </P>

<P>

Una crisis econ&oacute;mica generalizada, acompa&ntilde;ada de

sucesivas crisis pol&iacute;ticas, condicionaron las relaciones

interregionales tambi&eacute;n matizadas por dos acontecimientos

trascendentales del proceso de integraci&oacute;n europea. La

adhesi&oacute;n de Portugal y Espa&ntilde;a puso sobre la mesa

negociadora sus especiales relaciones con Latinoam&eacute;rica.

En el discurso pol&iacute;tico del momento, Espa&ntilde;a alent&oacute;

su papel de <I>puente</I> para atribuirse el peso de una potencia

media en el campo diplom&aacute;tico (Pi&ntilde;ol, 1993), ya

que en el econ&oacute;mico su situaci&oacute;n era bastante deficiente.

Fue secundada por algunos l&iacute;deres latinoamericanos que

anhelaban aumentar su influencia en el seno de la Comunidad, pero

ello despert&oacute; reticencias en las potencias medias con vocaci&oacute;n

de liderazgo como Argentina, Brasil o M&eacute;xico, que tacharon

de paternalistas algunas actitudes del Gobierno espa&ntilde;ol

(Rosenwig,1987), y en las dos grandes potencias coloniales europeas,

Francia y Reino Unido, que ve&iacute;an peligrar los privilegios

de sus zonas de influencia al ser diluidos entre un n&uacute;mero

demasiado extenso de pa&iacute;ses. </P>

<P>

La firma en febrero de 1986 del Acta &ograve;nica Europea (AUE),

para dinamizar el proceso de profundizaci&oacute;n en la construcci&oacute;n

europea, formaliz&oacute; la Cooperaci&oacute;n Pol&iacute;tica

Europea (CPE) mediante un acuerdo entre los Estados miembros sobre

materias fuera del alcance de las competencias comunitarias para

formular y aplicar conjuntamente una pol&iacute;tica exterior

europea. Paulatinamente, la Comunidad abandon&oacute; la anterior

pol&iacute;tica inhibicionista sobre AL y tom&oacute; posturas

m&aacute;s comprometidas, como fruto del previo debate interno

sobre el alcance de la CPE (Ifestos, P., 1987). </P>

<P>

<B>Di&aacute;logo e intervenci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica</B> </P>

<P>

Dejando de lado las diferencias provocadas por la crisis de la

guerra de las Malvinas, la intervenci&oacute;n m&aacute;s relevante

de la Comunidad en la regi&oacute;n fue su actuaci&oacute;n en

el conflicto centroam&eacute;ricano, que tuvo diferente cariz

al tratarse de una acci&oacute;n diplom&aacute;tica en favor de

una soluci&oacute;n negociada entre los pa&iacute;ses de la regi&oacute;n.

Su actitud en favor de las iniciativas locales, materializadas

en el Plan de Contadora, la distanci&oacute; de la postura intervencionista

de los Estados Unidos, con quien evitando un enfrentamiento abierto,

mantuvo una diferencia conceptual sobre la naturaleza del conflicto.

</P>

<P>

El Consejo Europeo del 29 de marzo de 1982 adopt&oacute; la primera

Declaraci&oacute;n favorable a las iniciativas de di&aacute;logo

regional en aplicaci&oacute;n del principio de soberan&iacute;a

nacional y respeto a la voluntad de los pueblos, al tiempo que

identificaba como principales causas del conflicto los profundos

problemas econ&oacute;micos y la desigualdad social de la regi&oacute;n;

y el Consejo de Stuttgart de junio de 1983 formul&oacute; el <I>enfoque

europeo</I> (D&iacute;az C&oacute;rdoba, A., 1992) al tiempo que

apoyaba la iniciativa de di&aacute;logo regional surgida en Contadora.

Su respaldo cristaliz&oacute; en la convocatoria de una cumbre

de jefes de Estado de San Jos&eacute;, en septiembre de 1984,

en la que adem&aacute;s de los pa&iacute;ses del <I>Istmo</I>,

la Comunidad, sus Estados miembros y el grupo de Contadora, participaron

Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal. </P>

<P>

La conferencia present&oacute; una doble vertiente; mientras se

prestaba apoyo pol&iacute;tico al proceso de paz, se trat&oacute;

de elaborar un plan de cooperaci&oacute;n. La conferencia <I>San

Jos&eacute; II</I>, celebrada en Luxemburgo en noviembre de 1985,

institucionaliz&oacute; el di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico, condensando

el momento &aacute;lgido de implicaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica

de la Comunidad en el conflicto que declin&oacute; despu&eacute;s

en favor del proceso de ampliaci&oacute;n primero y la negociaci&oacute;n

del Acta &ograve;nica despu&eacute;s. Las relaciones languidecieron

hasta la cumbre de Guatemala en 1987, cuya acta final dedic&oacute;

numerosas alusiones a la democratizaci&oacute;n en Nicaragua.

La actitud reticente impidi&oacute; llegar a la concreci&oacute;n

de un acuerdo econ&oacute;mico, repiti&eacute;ndose la situaci&oacute;n

al a&ntilde;o siguiente en Hamburgo. La conferencia de San Pedro

Sula, en febrero de 1989, concluy&oacute; en tono pol&iacute;tico

ambiguo aunque se lleg&oacute; a un acuerdo sobre ayuda extraordinaria.

</P>

<P>

La intervenci&oacute;n en C A a&uacute;n dio frutos tard&iacute;os;

de la fusi&oacute;n del Grupo de Contadora y el Grupo de apoyo

surgi&oacute; el denominado Grupo de R&iacute;o, con el que la

Comunidad entabl&oacute; un temprano contacto ya en septiembre

de 1987. Las relaciones recibieron un golpe de tim&oacute;n a

partir de la ampliaci&oacute;n del Grupo hasta cubrir un &aacute;rea

geogr&aacute;fica id&eacute;ntica a la de la Asociaci&oacute;n

Latinoamericana de Integraci&oacute;n (ALADI) en diciembre de

1989, constituy&eacute;ndose en un foro pol&iacute;tico permanente

de concertaci&oacute;n, di&aacute;logo y fomento de la integraci&oacute;n

regional que pudo presentarse como el principal interlocutor de

la regi&oacute;n, sustituyendo a otras opciones de di&aacute;logo

general, como el SELA y el GRULA o de integraci&oacute;n regional,

como el Pacto Andino. Al situarse los di&aacute;logos subregionales

en una posici&oacute;n intermedia, mientras persist&iacute;an

problemas para el avance de las relaciones de regi&oacute;n a

regi&oacute;n, consiguieron una importancia creciente (Wilhemy,

1988) y con ello se impon&iacute;a la argumentaci&oacute;n europea

que alegaba la heterogeneidad de realidades que representan los

diferentes pa&iacute;ses del continente para recurrir a criterios

de aplicaci&oacute;n selectiva frente la ilusi&oacute;n latinoamericana

de igualdad de trato (Grabendorf, 1988). </P>

<P>

Las Conferencias Interparlamentarias CE-AL cobraron vigor a medida

que el continente latinoamericano se redemocratizaba, contribuyendo

a reforzar el parlamentarismo en la regi&oacute;n. El Parlamento

Europeo solicit&oacute; la elaboraci&oacute;n de un proyecto de

cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica, financiera y de ayuda, as&iacute;

como el restablecimiento del di&aacute;logo y denunci&oacute;

el intervencionismo de Estados Unidos. Dado que sus resoluciones

no tienen car&aacute;cter obligatorio, adopt&oacute; la t&eacute;cnica

reiterativa a modo de presi&oacute;n sobre la Comisi&oacute;n,

&oacute;rgano principal en la iniciativa legislativa, labor en

la que destacaron los representantes espa&ntilde;oles. </P>

<P>

El proceso de acercamiento fue acompa&ntilde;ado de documentaci&oacute;n

program&aacute;tica comunitaria sobre las relaciones con AL; las

<I>Orientaciones para un fortalecimiento de las relaciones con

Am&eacute;rica Central</I> de 1981 ofrecieron apoyo para profundizar

el proceso de integraci&oacute;n como medio para asegurar la estabilidad,

la prosperidad y el crecimiento de la zona ycasi tres a&ntilde;os

despu&eacute;s, tras la iniciativa del SELA para abrir el di&aacute;logo,

la comisi&oacute;n elabor&oacute; un documento que conten&iacute;a

las <I>Orientaciones para fortalecer las relaciones entre la Comunidad

Europea y Am&eacute;rica Latina</I> recogiendo algunas reivindicaciones

latinoamericanas, aunque propugnaba un uso diferenciado de los

instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n y abogaba por la distinci&oacute;n

entre el &aacute;mbito regional, subregional y bilateral. </P>

<P>

Con transcendencia m&aacute;s testimonial que pr&aacute;ctica,

el Tratado de Adhesi&oacute;n de Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal recogi&oacute;

una declaraci&oacute;n com&uacute;n de intenciones relativa al

desarrollo y la intensificaci&oacute;n de las relaciones con AL,

pero d&iacute;as m&aacute;s tarde el Consejo Europeo encarg&oacute;

a la comisi&oacute;n un documento adaptado a los objetivos de

la declaraci&oacute;n. La comunicaci&oacute;n que present&oacute;

situaba la cooperaci&oacute;n interregional en un marco de orden

pol&iacute;tico y, como programa de acci&oacute;n, propuso el

refuerzo de las l&iacute;neas de cooperaci&oacute;n abiertas diversificandolas

a &aacute;mbitos que incluyesen al sector privado, pero se estimaba

necesario incrementar el presupuesto y la presencia de la comisi&oacute;n

en AL </P>

<P>

El Consejo aprob&oacute; las <I>Nuevas orientaciones de la CEE

para las relaciones con Am&eacute;rica Latina</I>, primer documento

que trazaba una estrategia global que atendiera a la diversidad

de las situaciones y las necesidades en AL valorando los espacios

de cooperaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica y las relaciones interparlamentarias.

Aunque acept&oacute; algunas propuestas y la necesidad de una

evaluaci&oacute;n peri&oacute;dica sobre su aplicaci&oacute;n,

no se comprometi&oacute; a aumentar los fondos y as&iacute; prim&oacute;

de nuevo la intencionalidad pol&iacute;tica sobre el contenido

material, confirmando la impresi&oacute;n de distanciamiento entre

las relaciones pol&iacute;ticas y las econ&oacute;micas (Van Klaveren,

1989). </P>

<P>

Puntualmente, buen n&uacute;mero de declaraciones institucionales

se refirieron a acontecimientos pol&iacute;ticos de AL denunciando

la violaci&oacute;n de Derechos Humanos por parte de los reg&iacute;menes

autoritarios. Esta alta preocupaci&oacute;n por su cumplimiento

en la zona, mucho mayor que la que inspiraban otras regiones donde

tambi&eacute;n distaban de ser respetados, fue considerada discriminatoria

por los gobiernos afectados pero, en otro sentido, se interpret&oacute;

como reconocimiento de un sistema de valores com&uacute;n; as&iacute;,

las declaraciones que saludaban los procesos de democratizaci&oacute;n

fueron se&ntilde;aladas como un segundo factor de politizaci&oacute;n

de las relaciones (Grabendorf, 1988). </P>

<P>

<B>Aspectos de la crisis econ&oacute;mica</B> </P>

<P>

En el &aacute;mbito econ&oacute;mico, las discrepancias entre

las tres instancias que participan en el proceso legislativo comunitario

son palpables. Podemos formular una proporci&oacute;n inversa,

seg&uacute;n la cual a menor poder de decisi&oacute;n mayor generosidad

en las propuestas y, al contrario, la falta de concreci&oacute;n

de las propuestas es directamente proporcional a la capacidad

de obligarse. </P>

<P>

As&iacute; la comisi&oacute;n en las <I>Orientaciones</I> de 1984

alegaba el estrecho margen de maniobra a corto y mediano plazo

en materia comercial y afirmaba que el factor determinante de

la disminuci&oacute;n o el estancamiento de la participaci&oacute;n

relativa de las exportaciones latinoamericanas no era el proteccionismo

de la Comunidad, sino factores de car&aacute;cter estructural.

Esta postura era fuertemente contestada por el SELA, quien acusaba

a la Comunidad de bloquear el di&aacute;logo, al eludir las consecuencias

negativas que las pol&iacute;ticas comercial y agr&iacute;cola

hab&iacute;an tenido en relaci&oacute;n a AL. En cambio, el Parlamento

Europeo s&iacute; asum&iacute;a que el proteccionismo de los pa&iacute;ses

desarrollados contribuy&oacute; a dificultar la situaci&oacute;n.

</P>

<P>

Al ingreso de Espa&ntilde;a y Portugal en la Comunidad, se estableci&oacute;

un r&eacute;gimen transitorio para algunos productos y Espa&ntilde;a

incluy&oacute;, a t&iacute;tulo propio, una declaraci&oacute;n

en la que propon&iacute;a encontrar soluciones permanentes en

el marco del SPG, lo que result&oacute; dif&iacute;cil dado el

car&aacute;cter temporal y no obligatorio del esquema que permite

su retirada total o parcial. Un nuevo reglamento inici&oacute;

la reforma del SPG el 12 de diciembre de 1985 basado en la aplicaci&oacute;n

diferenciada de las preferencias, la actualizaci&oacute;n de los

l&iacute;mites, el aumento de la seguridad del acceso a las ventajas

y la simplificaci&oacute;n. La diferenciaci&oacute;n continu&oacute;

en el Reglamento 3.635/87 alegando que los pa&iacute;ses relativamente

m&aacute;s avanzados hab&iacute;an obtenido los objetivos del

sistema al aumentar su cuota de mercado y no estaba justificado

prorrogarselo. Esta aplicaci&oacute;n diferenciada, sumada al

car&aacute;cter no preferencial, era contestada por los pa&iacute;ses

de renta media que ve&iacute;an en ella una especie de sanci&oacute;n

contra el progreso (Roett,R., 1982). </P>

<P>

En la crisis de la deuda externa, la falta de competencia de la

CE y la negativa de los Estados miembros a negociar al margen

de los organismos internacionales hicieron fracasar los t&iacute;midos

intentos de mediaci&oacute;n que trat&oacute; de poner en marcha

la comisi&oacute;n con apoyo del Parlamento. </P>

<P>

<B>Un nuevo mapa de acuerdos comerciales</B> </P>

<P>

El nuevo tratado con Brasil de 1980 inaugur&oacute; la <I>segunda

generaci&oacute;n</I> de acuerdos bilaterales de cooperaci&oacute;n

que superaba los l&iacute;mites comerciales recurriendo a la base

jur&iacute;dica del art&iacute;culo 235 TCEE. Brasil, que absorb&iacute;a

m&aacute;s de un cuarto del comercio total entre la CEE y Am&eacute;rica

Latina en su conjunto, era adem&aacute;s un importante proveedor

de materias primas. Esta doble vertiente se reflej&oacute; en

los objetivos del acuerdo: abrir fuentes de aprovisionamiento

y nuevos mercados. La Comunidad se neg&oacute; a reconocer a Brasil

como PVD por temor a la competitividad de sus producciones aunque

le reconoc&iacute;a como miembro del Grupo de los 77. </P>

<P>

En diciembre de 1983 se firm&oacute; con el Grupo Andino el primer

Tratado de Cooperaci&oacute;n con una asociaci&oacute;n de integraci&oacute;n

regional latinoamericana. Eran pa&iacute;ses que individualmente

no hab&iacute;an despertado el suficiente inter&eacute;s, pero

en conjunto superaban el volumen de intercambios de Brasil con

la Comunidad, con una balanza comercial deficitaria en su contra.

La Comunidad les reconoci&oacute; el estatuto de PVD, aunque matizado

seg&uacute;n los diferentes grados de desarrollo de cada pa&iacute;s

y se incluy&oacute; una declaraci&oacute;n unilateral prometiendo

mejoras en el SPG que llegaron con el Reglamento 3.752/83, donde

se estableci&oacute; la aplicaci&oacute;n conjunta a los pa&iacute;ses

del Grupo Andino de la definici&oacute;n de producto originario.

No hubo compromisos financieros concretos y tan s&oacute;lo se

instaba a las partes a poner los medios necesarios para la realizaci&oacute;n

de los objetivos. El acuerdo con los Estados miembros del Mercado

Com&uacute;n Centroamericano (MCCA) y Panam&aacute; se firm&oacute;

en la conferencia de Luxemburgo a imagen del anterior. </P>

<P>

En general todas las concesiones comerciales hechas durante dicho

per&iacute;odo a AL fueron unilaterales, de car&aacute;cter excepcional

y temporales. En el campo econ&oacute;mico en sentido amplio,

se extendieron los &aacute;mbitos materiales de cooperaci&oacute;n

poniendo &eacute;nfasis en la potencialidad del sector privado

(inversiones, capital riesgo, transferencia de tecnolog&iacute;a)

con dos objetivos espec&iacute;ficos: la ampliaci&oacute;n del

mercado interno de Am&eacute;rica Latina y la promoci&oacute;n

de las inversiones europeas directas en la regi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

<B>La diversificaci&oacute;n de la Cooperaci&oacute;n para el

Desarrollo</B> </P>

<P>

Partiendo de m&iacute;nimos, la pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n

comunitaria cre&oacute; una sofisticada red de instrumentos ampliando

sectores para adaptarse a la heterog&eacute;nea realidad latinoamericana.

A pesar de ello, no se respondi&oacute; a todas las expectativas

y en AL se extendi&oacute; la convicci&oacute;n de que Europa

no aportaba una contrapartida econ&oacute;mica suficiente a su

intervenci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica en apoyo de los fr&aacute;giles

procesos democr&aacute;ticos que trataban de salir adelante en

un contexto econ&oacute;mico, social, cultural e internacional

muy desfavorable. Sin embargo, s&iacute; se produjo un salto cuantitativo

de la cooperaci&oacute;n europea aunque gran parte de la ayuda

se trat&oacute; de capitalizar bilateralmente. Espa&ntilde;a,

consciente de sus limitaciones como donante individual, trat&oacute;

de jugar la carta europea y continu&oacute; el discurso aperturista

y globalizador iniciado por el Reino Unido en la d&eacute;cada

anterior. </P>

<P>

Durante la primera mitad de la d&eacute;cada prosigui&oacute;

una cooperaci&oacute;n financiera y t&eacute;cnica de corte cl&aacute;sico

basada en el desarrollo rural, 67% entre 1976-87, mientras la

ayuda industrial recib&iacute;a un 13%, los servicios un 8% y

la reconstrucci&oacute;n un 7%, por lo que se concentraba en las

zonas de menor desarrollo relativo y en sectores de poblaci&oacute;n

necesitada. Despu&eacute;s se inici&oacute; un tipo de cooperaci&oacute;n

m&aacute;s plural en los instrumentos y objetivos, inaugurando

el proceso de diversificaci&oacute;n seg&uacute;n el grado de

desarrollo de los pa&iacute;ses beneficiarios que se consolidar&iacute;a

en los noventa. </P>

<P>

La cooperaci&oacute;n con AL se estructur&oacute; en tres grandes

categor&iacute;as: la Cooperaci&oacute;n para el Desarrollo, que

comprende cooperaci&oacute;n financiera y t&eacute;cnica, ayuda

alimentaria y ayuda a trav&eacute;s de ONG; &eacute;sta supon&iacute;a

un 90% del total de ayudas comunitarias entre 1976-89; la ayuda

humanitaria, con el 6%; y la llamada Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica,

inicialmente con un 4% pero en ascenso. Al mismo tiempo, la Comunidad

iba afianzando su presencia y adquiriendo experiencia para gestionar

su participaci&oacute;n en los grandes proyectos de la zona; entre

1976 y 1984 dos tercios de los programas comunitarios se cofinanciaron

con otros donantes pero, conforme crec&iacute;an los medios financieros

y los instrumentos, se pas&oacute; a un tipo de <I>cofinanciaci&oacute;n

paralela</I> en la que la CE asum&iacute;a la responsabilidad

exclusiva de parte o todo un sector de un proyecto, hasta que

al final de la d&eacute;cada su participaci&oacute;n se aproxim&oacute;

al 80% del costo total. </P>

<P>

La inclusi&oacute;n del &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n

fue la gran novedad de los acuerdos de segunda generaci&oacute;n;

en el acuerdo con Brasil, dado el mayor desarrollo relativo del

pa&iacute;s, se propuso la reciprocidad e incluso, una cooperaci&oacute;n

cofinanciada respecto a terceros. En cambio, el acuerdo con los

pa&iacute;ses del Grupo andino (receptores de un 50% de la ayuda

financiera y t&eacute;cnica de AL) y el MCCA, recogi&oacute; una

distinci&oacute;n en tres &aacute;mbitos: la cooperaci&oacute;n

econ&oacute;mica, la cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo y la

cooperaci&oacute;n comercial; pero su aplicaci&oacute;n se dej&oacute;

a los programas comunitarios sin adquirir obligaciones contractuales.

</P>

<P>

En su expansi&oacute;n hacia nuevas zonas geogr&aacute;ficas la

pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n evolucion&oacute; de un

tratamiento gen&eacute;rico respecto a los destinatarios, pero

limitado en cuanto a los objetivos, a instrumentos m&aacute;s

espec&iacute;ficos dirigidos a determinadas categor&iacute;as

de sujetos. El primer reglamento que dio base jur&iacute;dica

estable a la Cooperaci&oacute;n Financiera y T&eacute;cnica con

los PVD no asociados en 1981 presentaba una cooperaci&oacute;n

asistencial; ayudas en forma de subvenciones no reembolsables

que potenciaban proyectos de desarrollo rural, producci&oacute;n

alimentaria y, de forma marginal, proyectos de integraci&oacute;n

regional y ayuda a la reconstrucci&oacute;n en caso de cat&aacute;strofes

naturales. La prioridad para los PVD menos desarrollados limitaba

el acceso de AL a los fondos de modo que s&oacute;lo CA y los

pa&iacute;ses menos desarrollados del Pacto Andino fueron destinatarios

de importancia. Cada a&ntilde;o se establec&iacute;a una clave

de reparto geogr&aacute;fico que comenz&oacute; siendo del 73%

para Asia, el 20% para Am&eacute;rica Latina y el 7% para &ccedil;frica

y fue acortando distancias hasta que en 1988 se separaron las

l&iacute;neas presupuestarias haciendo posible que un aumento

para AL no repercutiera en Asia, aunque se pact&oacute; un 65%

para a Asia y un 35% a AL. La adjudicaci&oacute;n de las ayudas

se hac&iacute;a por la comisi&oacute;n PVD-ALA compuesta de representantes

de los Estados miembros sin que el beneficiario participase m&aacute;s

que dando su consentimiento en el convenio de financiaci&oacute;n.

</P>

<P>

Al final de la d&eacute;cada, algunos gobiernos latinoamericanos

tomaron la iniciativa de presentar a la Comunidad solicitudes

de financiaci&oacute;n para proyectos propios integrados en programas

de &aacute;mbito nacional, contribuyendo a la dinamizaci&oacute;n

de las estrategias de desarrollo dise&ntilde;adas por las autoridades

locales. As&iacute;, Centroam&eacute;rica acudi&oacute; a <I>San

Jos&eacute; IV</I> en 1988 con el Plan de Acci&oacute;n Inmediata.

En 1989, el Gobierno boliviano present&oacute; el <I>Programa

de autodesarrollo campesino</I>; se firm&oacute; un convenio de

financiaci&oacute;n con Per&uacute; para un Programa de desarrollo

del Altiplano y se colabor&oacute; en el <I>Plan especial de Cooperaci&oacute;n

para Colombia</I>. Estos programas iban destinados a eliminar

focos de marginaci&oacute;n y conflictividad social, con la finalidad

de contribuir a una estabilidad de los Gobiernos democr&aacute;ticos.

</P>

<P>

Dentro de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica se abrieron las

l&iacute;neas de promoci&oacute;n comercial con 23 MECUS hasta

1989, cooperaci&oacute;n energ&eacute;tica (21 MECUS), promoci&oacute;n

industrial y de las inversiones (20 MECUS). Adem&aacute;s de apoyo

a la integraci&oacute;n regional y medio ambiente incorporados

al final con cantidades marginales. </P>

<P>

En las llamadas pol&iacute;ticas horizontales de cooperaci&oacute;n,

por no tener un destinatario regional, la participaci&oacute;n

de AL fue minoritaria, a lo cual se uni&oacute; la magritud de

los fondos del presupuesto (salvo la ayuda alimentaria). En 1982

se aprob&oacute; el primer programa de la ciencia y la t&eacute;cnica

al servicio del desarrollo 1982-1986, a los que se asociaron centros

latinoamericanos en un 15% de proyectos, dobl&aacute;ndose las

dotaciones en 1987. Del programa de cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

internacional pod&iacute;an beneficiarse s&oacute;lo aquellos

PVD con los que la Comunidad ten&iacute;a firmados acuerdos de

Cooperaci&oacute;n (pa&iacute;ses ALAMED), e iba destinado a fomentar

la movilidad de los cient&iacute;ficos de los PVD. </P>

<P>

Debido a las cr&iacute;ticas, la ayuda alimentaria fue objeto

de una reforma que la desvincul&oacute; de la gesti&oacute;n de

los excedentes agr&iacute;colas integr&aacute;ndola en la pol&iacute;tica

global de desarrollo de la Comunidad. La participaci&oacute;n

de AL se concentr&oacute; en los pa&iacute;ses de renta m&aacute;s

baja, destacando la ayuda a los refugiados y personas desplazadas

a causa del conflicto centroamericano. </P>

<P>

En octubre de 1983 se cre&oacute; el Instituto de Relaciones Europa-Am&eacute;rica

Latina (IRELA) con el objetivo de fortalecer las relaciones entre

la Comunidad Europea y Am&eacute;rica Latina, as&iacute; como

prestar su asistencia a las instituciones comunitarias. A partir

de entonces se dedic&oacute; a promocionar la investigaci&oacute;n

y facilitar el di&aacute;logo sobre cuestiones interregionales.

<a name=1990></a><B>1990-95: Concertaci&#243;n y diversificaci&#243;n de instrumentos</B>

</P>

<P>

Debido a los importantes cambios en la escena internacional era

previsible que la atenci&oacute;n europea se concentrase en los

procesos pol&iacute;ticos y econ&oacute;micos de sus vecinos contiguos,

pero otros factores coadyuvaron al decaimiento de la atenci&oacute;n

europea por AL: los procesos de democratizaci&oacute;n en la regi&oacute;n

se iban consolidando, al tiempo que cierta recuperaci&oacute;n

econ&oacute;mica y la aceptaci&oacute;n de la disciplina presupuestaria

no hac&iacute;an temer por un incumplimiento de los compromisos

sobre deuda externa. A ello se unieron condicionantes del propio

proceso de construcci&oacute;n comunitaria para la firma del Tratado

sobre la Uni&oacute;n Europea (TUE) de 1992 en Maastricht y las

negociaciones para el ingreso de los tres candidatos n&oacute;rdicos

m&aacute;s Austria. Finalmente, la cumbre de Essen consagr&oacute;

la estrategia de apertura al Este para su futura integraci&oacute;n

en la Uni&oacute;n y el desarrollo de una nueva pol&iacute;tica

de cooperaci&oacute;n con los pa&iacute;ses mediterr&aacute;neos.

</P>

<P>

<B>Consolidaci&oacute;n del di&aacute;logo</B> </P>

<P>

En el terreno pol&iacute;tico se opera un viraje desde una estrategia

reactiva a corto plazo a una acci&oacute;n sostenida basada en

el di&aacute;logo permanente y con vocaci&oacute;n de sustituir

la pasada concatenaci&oacute;n de actos unilaterales por medidas

concertadas. </P>

<P>

El inter&eacute;s europeo por influir en el restablecimiento de

las democracias se materializ&oacute; en la condicionalidad pol&iacute;tica,

mal asimilada en AL donde se&ntilde;alan la contradicci&oacute;n

entre esta extraordinaria preocupaci&oacute;n por la integridad

de las instituciones democr&aacute;ticas latinoamericanas y la

negativa a cambiar pol&iacute;ticas econ&oacute;micas(Heine, 1991)

que obstaculizaban el acceso a los mercados comunitarios. A pesar

de ello, se impuso la llamada cl&aacute;usula democr&aacute;tica,

por la cual la aplicaci&oacute;n de las disposiciones reglamentarias

o los acuerdos interregionales y bilaterales queda sometida al

mantenimiento del Estado de Derecho democr&aacute;tico y al respeto

a los Derechos Humanos. </P>

<P>

Tras la institucionalizaci&oacute;n del di&aacute;logo con el

Grupo de R&iacute;o parecen haberse consolidado dos subdi&aacute;logos

que cubren toda la regi&oacute;n, salvo Cuba. En el di&aacute;logo

con Centroam&eacute;rica el eje de gravedad bascul&oacute; hacia

cuestiones econ&oacute;micas y el apoyo a la reconstrucci&oacute;n.

Para ello contaron con un instrumento a trav&eacute;s del cual

implementar la ayuda, el acuerdo de Cooperaci&oacute;n, y un marco

donde situarla, el Plan Especial de Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica

para Centroam&eacute;rica (PEC) patrocinado por la ONU. </P>

<P>

En el aspecto pol&iacute;tico la Comunidad mantuvo dos objetivos

respecto a CA: el cese de los conflictos con la instauraci&oacute;n

de reg&iacute;menes democr&aacute;ticos y el estrechamiento de

los v&iacute;nculos interregionales como medida de seguridad para

evitar el resurgimiento de los conflictos(Galinsoga, A., 1995).

Las declaraciones de las conferencias de la serie <I>San Jos&eacute;</I>

se acompa&ntilde;aron de un importante aumento de la cooperaci&oacute;n

econ&oacute;mica, sobre todo en programas de reconstrucci&oacute;n

y reinserci&oacute;n de refugiados que convirti&oacute; a Centroam&eacute;rica

en la primera regi&oacute;n receptora de ayuda comunitaria per

c&aacute;pita (Del Arenal, 1994). </P>

<P>

La Conferencia de Roma con el Grupo de R&iacute;o en diciembre

de 1990 fue convocada con expresa intenci&oacute;n de institucionalizar

este foro, al fracasar la apuesta italiana por la ALADI. La controversia

resid&iacute;a en la diferente naturaleza de ambas instancias;

ALADI es un organismo estructurado para estimular el acercamiento

comercial entre sus miembros, por lo que las coordenadas pol&iacute;ticas

externas le son ajenas, por el contrario, la naturaleza pol&iacute;tica

y no org&aacute;nica del Grupo de R&iacute;o dificulta considerar

ese di&aacute;logo como una negociaci&oacute;n, dada la asimetr&iacute;a

de los interlocutores. </P>

<P>

Tras la conferencia de Luxemburgo en abril de 1991, donde se firm&oacute;

el acuerdo con M&eacute;xico, vino la de Santiago de Chile en

mayo de 1992, condicionada por la situaci&oacute;n en Per&uacute;

y los intentos de golpe de Estado en Venezuela. Una vez reincorporado

Per&uacute; se firm&oacute; el acuerdo marco con el Pacto Andino

en la reuni&oacute;n de Copenhague en 1993 y la conferencia de

abril de 1994 adopt&oacute; la <I>Declaraci&oacute;n de Sao Paulo</I>,

que estableci&oacute; pautas para una serie de acciones conjuntas

en el plano pol&iacute;tico, econ&oacute;mico y de cooperaci&oacute;n

con el fin de promover los intercambios en el inter&eacute;s mutuo

de las dos regiones. Subsiste la duda sobre el alcance real de

la cooperaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica en un mundo en que las relaciones

econ&oacute;micas dominan las relaciones de poder. Sin embargo,

dada la escasa atenci&oacute;n que AL recibe de Europa, la posibilidad

de hacer o&iacute;r su voz de manera regular sigue siendo una

importante baza a la hora de plantear nuevas v&iacute;as de acercamiento.

</P>

<P>

En el plano interregional, la Comisi&oacute;n elabor&oacute; una

propuesta de documento sobre las nuevas<I> Orientaciones para

la cooperaci&oacute;n con Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia en la d&eacute;cada

de los noventa,</I> en junio de 1990, basado en el apoyo a la

democracia y los Derechos Humanos con la generalizaci&oacute;n

de la cl&aacute;usula democr&aacute;tica unido al desarrollo sostenible,

que introduce la dimensi&oacute;n ambiental en la pol&iacute;tica

de cooperaci&oacute;n. Dentro de &eacute;sta, se distingu&iacute;a

entre la destinada a los pa&iacute;ses mas pobres y la cooperaci&oacute;n

avanzada destinada a los pa&iacute;ses o regiones de renta media,

pero concebida en t&eacute;rminos de reciprocidad. El 31 de Octubre

de 1994, el Consejo Europeo de la UE aprob&oacute; el Documento

B&aacute;sico sobre las relaciones de la Uni&oacute;n Europea

con Am&eacute;rica Latina y el Caribe que propone una nueva colaboraci&oacute;n

basada en los valores democr&aacute;ticos (cita tres interlocutores:

el Grupo de R&iacute;o, Am&eacute;rica Central y Mercosur) y ofrece

iniciar conversaciones sobre nuevos acuerdos m&aacute;s ambiciosos.

</P>

<P>

El Parlamento Europeo a trav&eacute;s de su di&aacute;logo privilegiado

en las Conferencias Interparlamentarias, se ha convertido en el

portavoz ordinario de las preocupaciones latinoamericanas e inductor

de nuevos instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n. En apoyo a la integraci&oacute;n

regional la Comisi&oacute;n ha celebrado acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n

interinstitucional con sus hom&oacute;logas en los sistemas de

cooperaci&oacute;n interregional y abri&oacute; nuevas delegaciones

u oficinas permanentes de la Comunidad. Finalmente formaliz&oacute;

su estatuto de observador en la Organizaci&oacute;n de Estados

Americanos (OEA), la ALADI y el SELA. Todo ello se traduce en

la creaci&oacute;n de una red ordinaria de intercambios que se

suma al di&aacute;logo de las cumbres y a la realizada de forma

bilateral entre la Comunidad y los pa&iacute;ses con los que tiene

firmados acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

El 2 de abril de 1990, con la firma del primer Acuerdo Marco de

Cooperaci&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica con Argentina, se inaugur&oacute;

la serie de los llamados acuerdos de <I>Tercera Generaci&oacute;n</I>

donde se aplicaba en el plano bilateral las nuevas orientaciones.

</P>

<P>

Posteriormente se firmaron nuevos acuerdos hasta cubrir casi la

totalidad de la regi&oacute;n: Chile, en diciembre de 1990, M&eacute;xico

en abril de 1991, Uruguay en noviembre de 1991, Paraguay en febrero

de 1992, Brasil en junio de 1992 y en 1993, el acuerdo con Centroam&eacute;rica

en febrero y con el Pacto Andino en abril. </P>

<P>

Destacan cuatro caracter&iacute;sticas claves (De Juan y Pe&ntilde;alosa,

R., 1991): el condicionamiento democr&aacute;tico de la cooperaci&oacute;n,

recogido en cl&aacute;usula expresa (salvo en el acuerdo con M&eacute;xico);

la importancia de la cooperaci&oacute;n industrial, cient&iacute;fica

y tecnol&oacute;gica; la concepci&oacute;n del acuerdo como un

instrumento de estrategia global de desarrollo y la cl&aacute;usula

evolutiva que permite ampliar y profundizar los niveles de cooperaci&oacute;n

por mutuo consentimiento. Estos acuerdos son el marco obligado

para acceder a los nuevos instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n avanzada;

sin embargo, al no acompa&ntilde;arse de un protocolo financiero,

la financiaci&oacute;n depender&aacute; de las asignaciones presupuestarias

que decida la Uni&oacute;n Europea. </P>

<P>

<B>Cooperaci&oacute;n comercial</B> </P>

<P>

El SPG, que experiment&oacute; una p&eacute;rdida acumulada de

las ventajas comerciales como resultado de la progresiva disminuci&oacute;n

de los aranceles comunitarios respecto a terceros Estados y la

ampliaci&oacute;n de barreras no arancelarias, fue reformado con

la sustituci&oacute;n de la antigua diferenciaci&oacute;n en productos

y pa&iacute;ses por la aplicaci&oacute;n de dos nuevas t&eacute;cnicas:

el mecanismo de graduaci&oacute;n, que mide el grado de dependencia

del pa&iacute;s beneficiario respecto al producto y el nivel de

ingresos per c&aacute;pita junto al nivel de exportaciones hacia

la UE, y el mecanismo de solidaridad aplicado en caso de que un

solo pa&iacute;s acapare el 25% excluy&eacute;ndolo del SPG. </P>

<P>

En el plano bilateral, los acuerdos marco no aportan cambios de

r&eacute;gimen apreciables, en cambio, suscita expectativas el

acuerdo interregional de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica y

comercial con MERCOSUR del 15 de diciembre de 1995, pues supone

una apertura negociada y rec&iacute;proca de los mercados y no

una concesi&oacute;n voluntaria y unilateral. La comunicaci&oacute;n

de la Comisi&oacute;n al Consejo <I>Para un refuerzo de la pol&iacute;tica

de la UE hacia MERCOSUR</I> propuso una estrategia en dos etapas:

una de transici&oacute;n que, mediante la conclusi&oacute;n del

acuerdo, prepare la liberalizaci&oacute;n de los intercambios

al tiempo que da apoyo t&eacute;cnico, industrial y financiero

al proceso de integraci&oacute;n; y, posteriormente, una asociaci&oacute;n

interregional fundada en una relaci&oacute;n equilibrada en el

plano econ&oacute;mico, pol&iacute;tico y comercial y cuyos principales

ejes son el establecimiento flexible y progresivo de una zona

de libre cambio en el terreno industrial y una liberalizaci&oacute;n

rec&iacute;proca y progresiva de los intercambios. </P>

<P>

Los acuerdos actuales act&uacute;an como condici&oacute;n previa

a mecanismos de cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica aunque el

acceso concreto se regula mediante convenios espec&iacute;ficos

bilaterales o acuerdos interinstitucionales. Son instrumentos

no creados originalmente para AL sino para zonas de inter&eacute;s

prioritario, pero le fueron extendidos de forma provisional y

restringida y suponen el acceso a nuevas fuentes de inversi&oacute;n

y el fortalecimiento del tejido empresarial mediante lazos interregionales.

Algunos son: la extensi&oacute;n de las operaciones Banco Europeo

de Inversiones (BEI) en abril de 1991 por un per&iacute;odo de

tres a&ntilde;os; el European Community Investment Partners (ECIP),

un instrumento de promoci&oacute;n de la inversi&oacute;n privada

a trav&eacute;s de la creaci&oacute;n de empresas mixtas entre

operadores comunitarios y los de otras regiones; y el BC-Net,

un sistema inform&aacute;tico dedicado a las Peque&ntilde;as y

Medianas Empresas (PYME) que vincula a directivos para que eval&uacute;en

posibles formas de cooperaci&oacute;n y contacten con socios potenciales.

</P>

<P>

<B>Formalizaci&oacute;n de la Pol&iacute;tica de Cooperaci&oacute;n

comunitaria</B> </P>

<P>

Tanto las Orientaciones para la Cooperaci&oacute;n con Am&eacute;rica

Latina y Asia de junio de 1990, como el acuerdo del Consejo del

19 de diciembre de 1990 sobre las <I>Orientaciones generales de

la Cooperaci&oacute;n financiera y t&eacute;cnica en favor de

los PVD de Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia para el per&iacute;odo

1991-1995</I>, mantuvieron los grandes ejes de la cooperaci&oacute;n

introduciendo una nueva prioridad en la dimensi&oacute;n estructural

como apoyo a los programas de ajuste econ&oacute;mico en la que

se prev&eacute; la concertaci&oacute;n con otros donantes. La

ayuda queda condicionada pol&iacute;ticamente, salvo las actividades

que tengan como beneficiario directo a poblaciones que sufren

graves penurias. Del conjunto de 2.750 MECUS para el per&iacute;odo,

un 65% se destina a Asia y un 35% a AL </P>

<P>

El nuevo Reglamento de base n&#186; 443/92 de 25 de febrero de

1992 recoge las orientaciones enunciando los cuatro sectores clave

de la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica: aumentar el potencial

cient&iacute;fico y tecnol&oacute;gico, apoyo a las instituciones

democr&aacute;ticas, ayuda a las Pyme mediante la promoci&oacute;n

comercial y la formaci&oacute;n de t&eacute;cnicos y cooperaci&oacute;n

regional. Con car&aacute;cter general, ambas modalidades de cooperaci&oacute;n

tendr&aacute;n la forma de subvenciones no reembolsables y, en

lo posible, se establecer&aacute; una programaci&oacute;n plurianual

indicativa por objetivos, por pa&iacute;ses o por regiones. Se

procurar&aacute; conseguir sistem&aacute;ticamente la participaci&oacute;n

financiera de receptores, Estados miembros y otros donantes. </P>

<P>

A partir de 1992, la pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n para

el desarrollo de la CE tuvo que adaptarse a la nueva regulaci&oacute;n

del TUE que le otorg&oacute; una base jur&iacute;dica expresa.

La Comisi&oacute;n elabor&oacute; el documento <I>La Pol&iacute;tica

de Cooperaci&oacute;n para el desarrollo en el horizonte del a&ntilde;o

2000</I> asoci&aacute;ndola al desarrollo de la pol&iacute;tica

exterior europea. Para AL propuso fomentar las inversiones y el

sector privado al tiempo que se da un apoyo a las reformas econ&oacute;micas,

concentrando la AOD en los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s pobres; y

a escala regional, en CA la consolidaci&oacute;n del proceso de

paz y el apoyo a la modernizaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica; en

los pa&iacute;ses andinos, el apoyo a las reformas econ&oacute;micas

y para los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s avanzados, una cooperaci&oacute;n

con mayor presencia de los agentes econ&oacute;micos europeos.

</P>

<P>

Los nuevos acuerdos de tercera generaci&oacute;n introdujeron

la cooperaci&oacute;n avanzada, pero no crearon instrumentos para

practicarla, as&iacute; que se deber&aacute; acudir a la negociaci&oacute;n

y contractualizaci&oacute;n en los casos de relaci&oacute;n rec&iacute;proca

de cooperaci&oacute;n, y a la aprobaci&oacute;n unilateral m&aacute;s

aceptaci&oacute;n en los casos de ayuda concesional. En definitiva,

las relaciones entre la Comunidad y AL se expandieron al comenzar

la d&eacute;cada, pero paulatinamente el mecanismo de acercamiento

basado en una diversificaci&oacute;n y proliferaci&oacute;n de

instrumentos ha empezado a dar signos de agotamiento al no acompa&ntilde;arse

de un aumento sustancial de los recursos empleados. </P>

Development Co-operation Review Series:<br>United Kingdom<br>

<i>OECD Development Assistance Committee</i><p></h3>

<h4>This Report</h4>

The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.

<p>

The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.

<p>

This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 24 February 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.

<p>

<h4>Main Points</h4>

Despite a growing budget for aid, the British aid programme, particularly the bilateral component, is under severe pressure. The proportion of aid to gross national product has declined in recent years and budget projections till 1997 show little growth in real terms. A concern discussed in the report is the growing commitment of aid resources to multilateral organisations. Unless total aid resources are increased, the distinctive bilateral programme would be under severe pressure, with consequent impacts on the non-govermental and other organisations that are rely on these funds to a large extent.

<p>

The report reviews the volume and distribution of aid, geograpically and thematically. Special attention is given to the linkages between aid policy and other economic and political instruments for cooperation with developing countries. The organisation and administration of the aid system is described and the evaluation system in reviewed. A description of UK aid to Uganda is included as a way to provide insights into the operation and management of the aid programme.

<a name="aid"><hr><h2><i>Le Conseil  D&#233;veloppement et les nouveaux

budgets de l'aide</i></h2></a>

Le Conseil semestriel des Ministres du D&#233;veloppement a eu lieu le

20 d&#233;cembre dernier. Il a &#233;t&#233; largement consacr&#233;

&#224; l'examen des proc&#233;dures de gestion suite aux nouvelles

r&#233;glementations de la Commission sur les lignes budg&#233;taires

en faveur de l'ensemble des pays en d&#233;veloppement, domaine

caract&#233;ris&#233; jusqu'ici par un vide juridique complet.

<p>

Le Conseil &#233;tait pr&#233;sid&#233; par Jose Luis Dicenta

Ballester, Ministre d'Etat espagnol pour la Coop&#233;ration

internationale et l'Am&#233;rique latine.

<p>

Dans la ligne de la politique communautaire de transparence

d&#233;finie le 17 juillet dernier, les Ministres ont tenu dans la

matin&#233;e un d&#233;bat public sur une nouvelle

r&#233;glementation garantissant une aide alimentaire de l'ordre de 500

millions d'ECU. Elle regroupe toutes les dispositions existantes en un

R&#232;glement unique et couvre le financement de nouveaux domaines

tels que l'allocation d'intrants, la fourniture de semences, le stockage et

les syst&#232;mes d'alerte pr&#233;coce.

<p>

Les projets participant &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; alimentaire, &#224;

la mise en place de syst&#232;mes d'alerte pr&#233;coce -

destin&#233;s &#224; signaler les risques de s&#233;cheresse, par

exemple - et &#224; la cr&#233;ation de programmes de stockage

permettant d'&#233;viter des crises dans les pays d&#233;pourvus de

produits (y compris une aide directe au secteur priv&#233;) peuvent

b&#233;n&#233;ficier de ces fonds.

<p>

Les Ministres ont convenu que cette forme d'aide devrait &ecirc;tre

int&#233;gr&#233;e aussi largement que possible dans les politiques de

d&#233;veloppement et dans les strat&#233;gies alimentaires des pays

concern&#233;s, en veillant toutefois &#224; ne pas perturber les

march&#233;s locaux. La Commission peut d&#233;cider seule de

projets dont le montant ne d&#233;passe pas 2 millions d'ECU; au-

del&#224; de ce montant, elle doit les soumettre &#224; l'approbation

des Etats membres.

<p>

Plusieurs Ministres ont soulign&#233; que l'aide communautaire ne

devait en aucun cas porter pr&#233;judice aux int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des

populations locales : "Quiconque s'est rendu en Tanzanie a

&#233;t&#233; immanquablement frapp&#233; par les effets

(n&#233;gatifs) des efforts massifs de l'aide internationale sur la

population locale", a d&#233;clar&#233; Joan Burton, Secr&#233;taire

d'Etat irlandaise charg&#233;e de l'aide ext&#233;rieure au

d&#233;veloppement.

<p>

Le Conseil a adopt&#233; un autre texte concernant la gestion de l'aide

humanitaire sous les auspices de l'Office humanitaire de la

Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne (ECHO). Cette forme d'aide a

atteint 765 millions d'ECU en 1994 et ECHO peut d&#233;sormais

statuer lui-m&ecirc;me sur les projets de moins de 10 millions d'ECU,

sans consulter les Etats membres.

<p>

Un accord a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; pris concernant la gestion

d'une aide s'&#233;levant &#224; 125 millions d'ECU (500 millions d'ECU

entre 1995 et 1999) - bien que la Commission n'ait pas marqu&#233; son

accord &#224; ce sujet.

<p>

Les Etats membres ne sont pas parvenus, par contre, &#224; se mettre

d'accord sur les r&#232;gles relatives au cofinancement des

organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) et &#224; la

coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e. Une r&#233;glementation

concernant l'aide &#224; la r&#233;habilitation dans les pays en

d&#233;veloppement a &#233;t&#233; approuv&#233;e, en d&#233;pit

du d&#233;saccord de la Commission sur son contenu. Tout projet d'un

co&ucirc;t sup&#233;rieur &#224; 2 millions d'ECU doit &ecirc;tre soumis

&#224; l'approbation des Etats membres. Les Ministres se sont

davantage approch&#233;s du consensus en ce qui concerne une

r&#233;glementation sur les r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans les pays en

d&#233;veloppement d'Asie et d'Am&#233;rique latine. Cette ligne

budg&#233;taire couvre l'auto-suffisance et la r&#233;int&#233;gration

des personnes d&#233;plac&#233;es.

<p>

Des textes ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; adopt&#233;s concernant

les principes g&#233;n&#233;raux de coop&#233;ration &#224; appliquer

par l'UE pour promouvoir l'&#233;galit&#233; entre les sexes, d'une part,

et concernant les priorit&#233;s de l'aide communautaire en vue de la

protection des for&ecirc;ts tropicales dans les pays en

d&#233;veloppement au titre d'un programme quadriennal (1996-1999)

de 200 millions d'ECU, d'autre part.

<p>

Le texte relatif aux for&ecirc;ts tropicales d&#233;crit le type de projet

susceptible d'obtenir un financement et pr&#233;cise qu'outre les

gouvernements, des organisations d&#233;centralis&#233;es et

r&#233;gionales, des organismes publics, des communaut&#233;s

locales et traditionnelles, des op&#233;rateurs priv&#233;s, des

coop&#233;ratives et des ONG, de m&ecirc;me que des associations

repr&#233;sentant des populations vivant dans les for&ecirc;ts et

soucieuses de leur conservation, peuvent b&#233;n&#233;ficier des

fonds en question.

<p>

L'UE cherche plus particuli&#232;rement &#224; soutenir des projets

visant &#224; pr&#233;server les for&ecirc;ts tropicales, &#224;

r&#233;nover celles qui ont &#233;t&#233; endommag&#233;es, &#224;

favoriser leur d&#233;veloppement, &#224; instaurer des certificats,

&#224; assurer une formation aux habitants des r&#233;gions

foresti&#232;res ainsi qu'une aide &#224; la gestion et &#224; la

<p>

Les Ministres du D&#233;veloppement ont approuv&#233; en outre une

D&#233;claration sur le Burundi r&#233;clamant un cessez-le-feu &#224;

l'occasion de No&euml;l, "du 24 d&#233;cembre &#224; janvier avec

possibilit&#233; de prolongation". Le Conseil a &#233;galement

recommand&#233; la d&#233;signation d'un m&#233;diateur

sp&#233;cial de l'UE en vue d'&#233;tablir un dialogue entre les

populations r&#233;fugi&#233;es du Rwanda et du Burundi et leurs

gouvernements respectifs, de m&ecirc;me qu'avec les pays voisins.

<p>

Le d&#233;bat a port&#233; par ailleurs sur les n&#233;gociations

commerciales de la Commission europ&#233;enne avec l'Afrique du Sud,

lesquelles devraient aboutir dans le courant de 1996. Le Ministre

britannique du d&#233;veloppement d'outre-mer, Linda Chalker, a fait

remarquer "qu'il est tout aussi important pour nous et d'autres nations

europ&#233;ennes d'avoir acc&#232;s au march&#233; de l'Afrique du

Sud que l'inverse".

<p>

<a name="wom"><hr><h2><i>Le Conseil D&#233;veloppement et le

r&ocirc;le des femmes</i></h2></a>



Au cours de cette m&ecirc;me session, le Conseil D&#233;veloppement a reconnu -

 dans sa r&#233;solution sur l'&#233;galit&#233; des sexes - que "l'&#233;limination

des disparit&#233;s existant actuellement entre les femmes et les hommes constitue

un aspect essentiel du d&#233;veloppement du point de vue de l'efficacit&#233; de

l'aide et de la justice sociale".

<p>

Dans la foul&#233;e des engagements pris &#224; P&#233;kin lors de la

Conf&#233;rence mondiale sur les femmes en septembre 1995 et suivant les

recommandations de la Commission, le Conseil D&#233;veloppement s'est

engag&#233; &#224; rendre prioritaire la participation des femmes au

d&#233;veloppement.

<p>

Enon&#231;ant les principes g&#233;n&#233;raux qui devront, &#224; l'avenir,

pr&#233;sider &#224; l'&#233;laboration d'une coop&#233;ration au

d&#233;veloppement int&#233;grant la notion d'&#233;galit&#233; des sexes, tant au

niveau de l'Union que de ses Etats membres, le Conseil insiste pour que la mise en

oeuvre de ceux-ci ait lieu &#224; tous les niveaux, que ce soit dans la formulation

des politiques de d&#233;veloppement ou dans les n&#233;gociations avec les pays

partenaires.

<p>

Il souhaite &#233;galement que soient encourag&#233;es les "actions positives"

susceptibles de corriger les disparit&#233;s entre hommes et femmes. Il souligne le

r&ocirc;le important des organisations non gouvernementales dans ce domaine et

&#233;voque la possibilit&#233; d'un soutien aux organisations f&#233;minines et aux

r&#233;seaux de femmes.

<p>

Le Conseil a, par ailleurs, estim&#233; n&#233;cessaire un renforcement de la

capacit&#233; interne de la Commission et des Etats membres sur ces questions :

formation sp&#233;cialis&#233;e du personnel travaillant dans le domaine du

d&#233;veloppement,  int&#233;gration prioritaire des questions d'&#233;galit&#233;

des sexes dans les op&#233;rations d'urgence, de pr&#233;vention des crises et de

lutte contre la pauvret&#233;, &#233;tablissement d'un syst&#232;me de suivi.

<p>

Enfin, souhaitant une coordination plus &#233;troite entre la Communaut&#233; et

les Etats membres, le Conseil a invit&#233; la Commission &#224; entreprendre des

actions de collaboration avec ceux-ci  et &#224; &#233;laborer des propositions

pr&#233;cises sur des crit&#232;res et indicateurs communs, de mani&#232;re

&#224; ce qu'elle puisse rendre compte des progr&#232;s r&#233;alis&#233;s lors

de la session du second semestre 1997 du Conseil des Ministres du

D&#233;veloppement.

 <h3 align=center>                        by Maggie Black</h3>
 
 <br>
 
<font size=4>This book takes as its starting point the rise of children on national and international
agendas in
recent years. In countries around the world, Presidents and Prime Ministers - including Clinton,
Mandela, and even Major - are nowadays keen, or at least willing, to identify with the children's
cause, in the context of health, education, family support, or to combat child exploitation, abuse
or crime. <i>The cause of children has abandoned its nanny image and taken on political edge.
</i></font><p>

<hr width=71%><p>

<b>Children First</b> was commissioned by UNICEF for its 50th anniversary year, and it naturally
focuses on UNICEF's role, especially that of its late Executive Director, James P. Grant, in
bringing children to a position of unprecedented prominence. But it is careful to stress that
underlying social trends hold the key, including changing patterns of reproduction and family life
and lengthening childhood dependency in developing and industrialised countries alike. UNICEF's
recent dynamic championship of children internationally has worked so well because it fell upon
fertile ground. <p>


Nominally, this is a history of an organisation. In fact it is an exploration of evolving ideas and
practice in international social development, with UNICEF acting as lens, barometer and
institutional expression of world-wide concern for children. Under Grant's leadership (1980-95),
UNICEF asserted the principle of "children first" within all macro-policy spheres, economic and
"developmental" as well as political and humanitarian. The strategy succeeded way beyond
expectations; humanity's willingness to mobilise behind the children's cause took even Grant by
surprise. <p>


Grant's initial UNICEF thrust, launched in the early 1980s, caused controversy within the
international community. He declared a "child survival revolution" and advocated widespread use
of low-cost public health techniques to save millions of children's lives needlessly lost to
preventable disease. Critics saw in this strategy a reversion to long abandoned "technical fix"
solutions to complex problems of poverty, but Grant waged an effective campaign to bring them
around. His "child survival" crusade was, in the final analysis, a triumphant success, delivering in
1990 "universal childhood immunization" and a World Summit for Children. This in turn helped
set in motion the reorientation of the whole international development agenda around "human
development" goals, since reflected in other UN initiatives and Summit declarations.<p>


The book is thematic, covering the evolution of policy and practice in maternal and child health
care, nutrition, water supplies and sanitation, education and emergency relief in the post-colonial
world. The "child survival revolution" enhanced activity on behalf of children in some of these
contexts; others suffered. The book is by no means uncritical either of UNICEF, or of the
direction in which it was steered by Grant. It also discusses children's issues within over-arching
themes such as urbanisation and industrialiation, human rights, armed conflict, the post-Cold War
transition, Africa's travails, and gender. <p>


In 1989 came a highly significant international development on behalf of children: the passage by
the UN of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. During the 1990s it has become the most
widely ratified human rights convention in history, with 187 signatory states. The extraordinary
response the Convention has elicited, alongside the constant media attention children's issues
today excite, is seen as corroboration that the cause of children has managed to gain
unprecedented currency. <p>


Since the 1960s, the perspective dominating UNICEF's work, a perspective dramatically
heightened under Grant, was to focus on the basic needs of children in the developing world as
part of the campaign against world poverty. In the post-Cold War era, the international campaign
on behalf of aid to the developing world is fast running into the historical sands. Therefore, in its
final chapter Children First suggests that the time has come for a major shift. UNICEF now
needs to reposition itself to pursue the fulfilment of children's rights within the framework of the
Convention in both developing and industrialised countries. Only in this arena can the international
prominence of the children's cause - on which UNICEF's own fortunes ultimately depend - be
sustained.<p>


This is the third historical review by Maggie Black of ideas and practice in the context of
international social development via an account of a key organisation and its evolving mission;
the two earlier volumes were a history of UNICEF (<i>The Children and the Nations</i>, MacMillan,
1987) and a history of Oxfam (<i>A cause for our times</i>, OUP and Oxfam, 1992). She is virtually
the
only writer producing this kind of historical analysis, and the book is an important contribution
to the aid and development literature.

<P>

La comparaci&oacute;n entre el Documento de seguimiento de las

realizaciones de la Cooperaci&oacute;n Internacional espa&ntilde;ola

durante 1994 con las previsiones, arroja un saldo ligeramente

negativo del 0,40%. Aunque en t&eacute;rminos absolutos este d&eacute;ficit

no se refleja en las cantidades destinadas a AOD, que presentan

un incremento del 3,64% (Cuadro 1), s&iacute; se produce una depreciaci&oacute;n

en t&eacute;rminos relativos, ya que se pasa de un porcentaje

del 0,28% del PIB en 1993 a un 0,27% en el 94. 

<P>

Los recortes se concentran en la Cooperaci&oacute;n Multilateral,

especialmente en los Organismos Internacionales financieros y

no financieros que, por su bajo componente de AOD, tienen menor

incidencia en el descenso final de &eacute;sta. Incluso, se observa

un aumento de la proporcion de AOD que representan las Contribuciones

a Organismos Internacionales no financieros, que pasan de un 2,27%

en 1993 a un 4,81% en 1994 (Cuadro 2). Dentro de este apartado

siguen en aumento los gastos destinados a las Operaciones de Mantenimiento

de la Paz de la ONU. (Cuadro 4). En cambio, la reducci&oacute;n

sobre la aportaci&oacute;n prevista a la UE no supone una disminuci&oacute;n

de su porcentaje del total de AOD, a causa de que el aumento programado

fue demasiado elevado.

<P>

En el apartado bilateral, una vez m&aacute;s, la Ayuda Alimentaria

fue sacrificada en favor de las eventualidades dictadas por las

situaciones de Emergencia que se fueron presentando, aunque los

niveles de ambas son pr&aacute;cticamente insignificantes sobre

el total de la AOD bilateral.

<P>

En el campo de la distribuci&oacute;n geogr&aacute;fica (Cuadro

5) se mantiene una estructura similar a la prevista, aunque se

observa el inicio de la tendencia al descenso de la parte de AOD

destinada a Am&eacute;rica Latina, a pesar de que pa&iacute;ses

como Argentina, M&eacute;xico, Ecuador o Uruguay contin&uacute;an

siendo importantes receptores en base a la partida de cr&eacute;ditos

FAD que se les destina, la &uacute;ltima que les podr&aacute;

ser atribuida seg&uacute;n los criterios de la OCDE aprobados

en Helsinki en 1991. En cambio se consolidan China y el Norte

de &Aacute;frica como principales receptores de ese tipo de ayuda,

mientras sube la proporci&oacute;n de ayuda bilateral no reembolsable

destinada al &Aacute;frica Subsahariana.

<P>

El documento del Seguimiento del PACI s&oacute;lo recoge la Cooperaci&oacute;n

Descentralizada realizada por las Comunidades Aut&oacute;nomas

que, aunque disminuye respecto a las previsiones, sube en un 1%

respecto al gasto realizado por &eacute;stas en 1993. El Gobierno

vasco con un 30% del total y Navarra con el 16,3% se mantienen

como los dos primeros donantes (Cuadro 7), aunque disminuyen su

proporci&oacute;n relativa por el incremento de otras Comunidades

como Andaluc&iacute;a, Arag&oacute;n o Valencia.

<P>

Algunos Gobiernos auton&oacute;micos como Andaluc&iacute;a, Asturias,

Catalu&ntilde;a, Galicia, Madrid y Valencia firmaron convenios

de colaboraci&oacute;n con organismos de Cooperaci&oacute;n de

la Administraci&oacute;n Central, inici&aacute;ndose as&iacute;

una pr&aacute;ctica de coordinaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s sistem&aacute;tica;

pero la gran mayor&iacute;a de los fondos se destinan a los programas

de subvenciones a proyectos ejecutados por ONGD. En este terreno

se observa una marcada preferencia por Am&eacute;rica Latina que

recibe el 65% del total, a mucha distancia del &Aacute;frica Subsahariana

que es la segunda &aacute;rea receptora(Cuadro 8).

<P>

La informaci&oacute;n que se dispone sobre la Cooperaci&oacute;n

realizada por las Corporaciones Locales (Cuadro 9) todav&iacute;a

resulta dif&iacute;cil de evaluar por las dificultades de la recogida

de datos dado, que muchas entidades no tienen presupuestos fijos.

A&uacute;n as&iacute;, de los datos que se desprenden de la encuesta

realizada por la Federaci&oacute;n de Municipios y Provincias,

Andaluc&iacute;a, Catalu&ntilde;a, Pa&iacute;s Vasco y Valencia

siguen apareciendo como las Comunidades con un mayor n&uacute;mero

de entidades que destinan regularmente cantidades de los fondos

municipales a la Cooperaci&oacute;n. La mayor&iacute;a de ellos

realizan sus aportaciones a proyectos realizados por ONGD vinculadas

a su municipio, aunque otras hacen sus aportaciones a los Fondos

Municipales de Desarrollo, que est&aacute;n experimentando una

evoluci&oacute;n positiva y pueden contribuir a estabilizar el

flujo de recursos, permitiendo una mayor planificaci&oacute;n.

<b><li>The Amnesty International Report 1995</b><br>
Each year Amnesty International publishes its Annual Report, which summarises the human rights situation around the world.  The theme of this year's report is human rights abuses against women.<p>

Women suffer every known human rights abuse in the world. They are being raped, mutilated and killed by both government and opposition forces and held as prisoners of conscience.<p>

This latest Amnesty International Report is a contribution to their struggle for justice, equality and freedom. It exposes a range of human rights violations suffered by women, men and children in 151 countries and it shows who was responsible. It is a challenge to all governments to bring them to an end.<b><br>

<b><li>Slamming the Door<br>
The Demolition of the Right to Asylum in the United Kingdom</b><br>
Around the world, there are at least 15 million men, women and children who have been forced  out of their homeland by political terror, state oppression and armed conflict.  Under international law, all governments have an obligation to provide protection to such people.<p>

Despite repeated protestations of its commitment to the principles of international refugee law, in recent years the British Government has introduced a raft of measures intended to prevent or deter such people from travelling to the United Kingdom to seek asylum.  The imposition of visa regimes on refugee-producing countries, the incarceration of asylum-seekers in prisons and detention centres while their cases are dealt with, and the use of special "fast track" mechanisms for certain cases have all undermined the right to seek asylum in the United Kingdom.<p>

However, seemingly not content with the effect of these restrictions, the Government has now introduced two further measures which take this process to new - and unacceptable - limits.  The Asylum & Immigration Bill - likely to become law in mid-1996 - provides for a critical erosion of
existing legal safeguards.  And new Social Security Regulations - which came into force on 5 February 1996 and deny many needy asylum-seekers the means to obtain food and shelter while awaiting determination of their asylum claim or appeal - effectively render meaningless such legal safeguards as will remain once the Bill has become law.<p>

This report sets out Amnesty International's concern that the combination of these measures amounts to an effective demolition of the United Kingdom's asylum process, and therefore to an abdication by the Government of its obligations under international law.  It shows how these measures form part of a secretive process aimed at establishing a common, restrictive European Union asylum policy.  And it demonstrates that, in seeking to justify these measures, Government ministers have used "bogus" arguments and relied upon "bogus" statistics.<b><br>

<b><li>Human Rights are Women's Right</b><br>
For millions of women the 1990's have meant terror, deprivation and the imperitive of fighting for justice.  Today what unites women internationally is their vulnerability to abuse of their fundamental human rights and their dedicated efforts to claim those rights.<p>

Most of the casualties of war are women and children; most of the world's refugees are children; most of the world's poor are women and children.  Human rights abuses against women remain rampant because they are largely hidden.<p>

This report launches Amnesty International's 1995 campaign for the protection of women's rights.  The report highlights the situation of women in some seventy five countries and shows how much work must be done if we are to have the United Nations' objective of 'equality by the year 2000".<br>

<b><li>Childhood Stolen<br>
Grave Human Rights Violations Against Children</b><br>
Every day, somewhere in the world, children face arrest, detention, torture and political murder.  Some are held as political prisoners by governments, cut off from family and outside support, tortured and even killed.  Some suffer physical or mental torture to force family members to confess or give themselves up.  Some are executed.  Some "disappear", never to be seen again.  Killed by shadowy murder squads linked to the government, the police and the military.  This report highlights the perils faced by children all over the world despite the protection provided by the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child, first adopted in 1989.

<b><li>Dead Man Walking: An Experience of Death Row<br></b>
 <i>By Helen Prejean</i><br> 
When Helen Prejean, a sister of St Joseph of Medaille, was invited to write to an inmate on death row in the United States, she ended up befriending him and witnessing his execution two years later. Almost immediately she became spiritual adviser to another inmate who remained unrepentant until his execution. This book is the extraordinary account of her relationship with the two murderers and her initiation into the world of America's death row.<br>

<b><li>The Execution Protocol</b><br>
<i>By Stephen Trombley <br></i>
This is the first book to go behind the scenes and look at what it is like to live and die on America's death row. Author and film maker Steven Trombley spent over a year immersed in the shadowy world of the capital punishment industry, embarking on a journey that allowed him to see and hear things many people cannot bring themselves to think about. The result is a shocking and immensely readable insight into the history and present practice of state sanctioned killing. <br>

Amnesty International has just launched its biggest ever campaign on China and this report sums up Amnesty's concerns in that country. Despite economic reforms, political repression and abuse of power mean that everyone is at risk of serious human rights violations. Torture is endemic.<p>

Thousands of political dissidents and members of religious and ethnic groups remain in jail simply for expressing their views. Hundreds of people who have never been charged with a crime are arbitrarily detained, many of them in forced labour camps. More people are executed in China each year than in all other countries of the world put together.<b><br>

Political Violence, Myth and Reality</b><br>
In Colombia the military literally get away with murder. Army counter-insurgency strategy, honed in forty years conflict with guerrillas, is the backdrop to massacre upon massacre. Widespread human rights violations go unpunished. Since 1986 over 20,000 people have died in political violence. Many died in confrontations between guerillas and government forces. Most were peasant farmers in conflict zones. The evidence, drawn from thousands of cases, shows that the security forces and their paramilitary allies are responsible for most of the killings.<br>

Despite its chilling human rights record, the government of Indonesia has enjoyed support and succour from the world's most powerful nations. Only the human rights violations in East Timor, illegally occupied since 1975, have touched the international conscience. This report demonstrates that human rights violations are widespread not only in East Timor, but in the entire Indonesian archipelago.<br>

<h3>Refugees</h3>

<ul><b><li>Playing Human Pinball</b><br>
Home Office Practice in "Safe Third Country" Asylum Cases</b><br>
In July 1993 the Government enacted new legislation - the Asylum & Immigration Appeals Act - providing for stricter application of the criteria for granting asylum and the rapid expulsion of rejected asylum-seekers.  Despite no apparent change in the nature of applications, the proportion
of successful applicants has since fallen substantially.<p>

In particular, the 1993 Act established a special "fast-track" procedure enabling the Home Office to seek to "pass the buck" by returning asylum-seekers to so-called safe third countries - that is, countries through which they passed in transit to the United Kingdom and where, it is held, they
should have sought asylum - without examining their asylum claims and without any guarantee that the "third country" in question will do so.<p>

This report - based on a nine-month study of 60 individual cases - demonstrates that this "fast-track" procedure has failed to perform to the Government's expectations: intended to allow for the expulsion of asylum-seekers to "third countries" within "a week to 10 days", the procedure has proven to be neither rapid nor productive in terms of expulsions.  It shows that the procedure imposes immense hardship on those unfortunate enough to fall within its scope.  It indicates that
this game of "human pinball" compromises the Government's upholding of its obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.  And it concludes that, unless the Government is willing to introduce proper safeguards, such practice - and the "fast-track" procedure itself - should be
abandoned and the millions of pounds it costs every year put to better use.<b><br>

<b><li>Prisoners Without a Voice<br>
Asylum-Seekers Detained in the United Kingdom</b><br>
<i>Second revised and expanded edition.</i><br>
In October 1994 Amnesty International UK published the first edition of this report. It demonstrated that a lack of accountability and absence of judicial control over the decision to detain asylum-seekers results in arbitrary decision making and, in at least 44% of cases, unnecessary detention.<p>

In the wake of its publication junior Home Office Minister, Nicholas Baker, was forced to reveal for the first time that the average cost of holding an asylum seeker in an immigration detention centre is "over £800 per week" and in a criminal prison £422 per week. Using these figures
Amnesty International has calculated that the cost of detaining asylum-seekers is about £20million per annum.<p>

This important report has been fully revised, expanded and updated to include the government's response to Amnesty International's recommendations.<b><br>

New challenges for social development.<br>
The 1995 World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen
confirmed the need for change in policies to improve human
welfare and well-being, both in the post-industrial countries of
the North and the developing countries of the South.  Save the
Children welcomes this approach, but believes that the goals of
the Declaration will be achieved only if children and their
needs, interests, and perspectives are placed at the centre of
social and economic policy, alongside and equal to those of
adults.  This report explains the impact of current development
approaches on children's lives, spells out the need for a
Children's Agenda, and discusses how this could be accomplished
in reality.<br>

<p><hr><p>

<h3>An Inevitable Evolution</h3>

<p>

<i>"Future ACP-EU development cooperation should no longer be the reserve of central agencies, but be

widened to actors that have been marginalised hitherto" (African private sector representative)</i>.

<p>

This is a key message that emerged during our consultation process. While it is certainly true that the new

partnership between Europe and the ACP countries will be cemented at government level, it will need to

be guided, both in its spirit and in the way in which it is put into effect, by institutional pluralism and

cooperation between different actors in the development field. This process of extending European

cooperation to non-state actors has been made inevitable as a result of:

<ul>

<li>Internal processes of change. In most ACP countries, important political and economic reforms have

been introduced over the last decade. The "rolling back"  of the state has created new opportunities for

participation in the political process by the private sector and by all the various constituents of civil

society. These "new" actors now demand that they be associated in the ACP-EU development cooperation

process;

<p>

<li>Participatory development. This concept has been around for a long time, but is now increasingly

accepted as the centrepiece of development partnerships. This has fuelled the search for new modalities

of aid delivery (such as decentralised cooperation) that may bring cooperation closer to the needs of

people. Donor agencies, including the EC, are slowly adapting their attitudes, management systems and

procedures accordingly;

<p>

<li>Concerns to get "value for money." Public opinion in Europe is increasingly critical of the use of aid

resources. Accountability demands are putting pressure on policy-makers and aid administrators.

Confronted with the failure of the "developmental state" (mainly in Africa), they are looking for other

partners that can ensure both efficiency and accountability. This explains, for instance, the spectacular

growth in the number of (southern) NGO's and the levels of funds accruing to them.

Great Potential to be Tapped

</ul><p>

During the consultation process, it was systematically argued that more participatory approaches - both

in national policy-making as well as in the use of Lom&#233; resources - could yield major development

benefits:

<ul>

<li>More realistic policies. During the past decades, the limitations of a highly centralised and

bureaucratic approach to development policy management have become evident. Bringing other actors into

the policy formulation process, may help to define policies that are better embedded in the social and

economic reality of the countries concerned.

<p>

<li>Complementary roles. The emergence of new actors may lead to a better division of tasks and a

search for complementarities (i.e. new public-private partnerships). However, this will require a

redefinition of the role of the state. Many feel the pendulum has shifted too much towards a "minimal

state." In their view, no development can take place in the absence of a functioning state apparatus -- as

is illustrated in those ACP countries where the state is in danger of collapse.. 

<p>

<li>Enhanced ownership and accountability. In general, top-down approaches have not enhanced a sense

of ownership among aid beneficiaries, nor have they fostered transparency in the management of funds.

The opening-up of Lom&#233; may facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources while reducing the

problems of aid absorption. The closer the accountability is brought to the beneficiaries, the more likely

it is that value for money will be achieved. 

</ul><p>

<h3>Beware of the Risks</h3>

<p>

One should not underestimate the complexity of the process of transition to new forms of participatory

and decentralised cooperation. Many people stress the danger of too radical a change. The decentralisation

of development cooperation should not be regarded as a panacea for all ills. It will not lead automatically

to a greater level of either participation or transparency. The following risks have been identified:

<ul>

<li>The danger of ignoring the state. It would be unwise for the EU to simply circumvent central

government and to distribute resources at random over a wide range of non-state actors.  First, there is

little support for donors taking on too prominent a role in deciding on their own with whom they want

to work. This raises major issues of sovereignty and political accountability (particularly in well-

established democracies). Second, the pursuit of unbridled privatisation and the dismantling of the state

would be just as great an error as centralisation - as illustrated by the experience of East Asia.

Development from below requires development from above. Whilst the private sector and civil society

may be able to complement the role of the state, they cannot replace it. If anything, future cooperation

should aim at strengthening the ability of the state to play its redefined role in development. In some parts

of Africa, what is at stake is nothing less than the "reconstruction of a viable state."

<p>

<li>Confusing money with substance.  Why is the involvement of non-state actors sought in European

cooperation? Is it just a question of shifting Lom&#233; funds from the state to non-state actors? Is it

merely geared to re-allocating responsibilities for the implementation of development programmes? Or is

the purpose rather to promote an open and transparent debate between different local actors on how to best

utilise EU support? 

<p>

<li>Loss of control. Major concerns exist as to the danger of transferring funds to non-state actors without

also setting up appropriate control and monitoring systems.

<p>

<li>Lack of capacity. One should not overestimate the ability of decentralised actors to participate in the

development process and to manage development cooperation programmes. Swamping non-state actors

with huge amounts of aid is a recipe for failure. In the case of the private sector, this would create unfair

competition and might kill the very dynamics that make the private sector successful. Capacity constraints

also exist at the European Commission. Adopting a more participatory approach implies a profound

change in donor attitudes, management, procedures and organisation.

</ul><p>

In the remainder of this section, we look more detail at what this "opening up" of ACP-EU cooperation

might mean for the private sector and civil society organisations.

<p>

<H3>Opening Cooperation to the Private Sector</H3>

<p>

<i>"The EU can help the private sector both directly and indirectly to become an

important stakeholder in the socio-economic development of ACP countries" (Caribbean

private sector representative)</i>.

<p>

The revised Lom&#233; Convention puts increased emphasis on private sector development

and investment promotion in ACP countries. These priorities reveal a growing consensus

among ACP states and the EU on the essential contribution of the private sector to

development. The "triumph" of the free-market economy and the globalisation of trade,

coupled with the tremendous social problems faced by most of the ACP countries, require

the presence of a dynamic (indigenous) private sector that can create employment and

wealth.

<p>

The underlying policy agenda is quite impressive. Private sector development implies, amongst

others, a supportive environment, the right incentives, new public-private partnerships, a wide

range of new institutional arrangements and major investments in building entrepreneurial and

management skills.

<p>

The primary responsibility for bringing about these changes lies in the hands of ACP

governments. This is repeatedly stressed by ACP non-state actors, who are generally very

critical of the attitudes of their governments. In their view, the private sector is still too often

perceived as "an enemy" rather than "an ally" in the development process.

<p>

Many ACP governments have yet to create the enabling and friendly environment to foster

private sector development. Or, in the words of an African private sector representative: 

"ACP countries must help themselves before seeking the help of others." The EU can play

a catalytic role in this process, provided it fundamentally reviews its strategies, approaches

and instruments in favour of private sector development. The following priority actions have

been suggested:

<p>

<H4>Increase understanding of the private sector </H4>

<p>

<i>"Where it refers to the private sector, the Convention is full of everything on paper but

very vague in terms of concrete and actionable policy proposals" (African private sector

representative)</i>.

<p>

This is the first step in the process of "reaching out" to private sector operators. A clear and

detached analysis of the current state of affairs reveals a simple truth: the private sector feels

"completely marginalised" in ACP-EU cooperation. The main frustrations of the ACP private

sector towards successive Lom&#233; Conventions can be summarised as follows:

<ul>

<li>Lack of participation in policy dialogue. ACP governments seldom provide

opportunities for the private sector to participate in formulating national development

policies or in setting priorities for the utilisation of Lom&#233; funds. There is hardly any

dialogue between the private sector and the EU (perhaps with some exceptions like the

dialogue established through the Caribbean Council for Europe). As a result, private sector

interests are generally poorly reflected in ACP-EU cooperation. Adequate support

measures and incentive packages are found wanting. Potential growth areas (such as

tourism in the Caribbean) do not receive the attention they deserve. Political

considerations may supersede efficiency criteria in allocating Lom&#233; resources (for

example, in the use of STABEX funds to reduce budgets deficits). 

<p>

<li>Unclear EU policies. The rationale for EU support is neither clearly spelt out nor well

understood. Is it to assist ACP firms to integrate in the global economy, to enhance the

competitiveness of ACP enterprises, or to encourage the emergence of an indigenous

industrial capacity? Or is it primarily geared at helping EU firms identify investment and

market opportunities? In the field, people observe a lack of policy coherence at the EU

level. Lom&#233; resources are spent over a longer period to support cash crop

production while later on these products are denied preferential access to EU markets. 

<p>

<li>Centralised management. ACP private sector actors fail to understand why

"bureaucrats should have the responsibility to manage Lom&#233; funds geared at private

sector development." This complicates access to the Convention, renders transparency

elusive and creates much red tape. All of this acts as a major disincentive for private

operators to participate in the life of the Convention. 

<p>

<li>Inappropriate (use of) instruments. In several ACP countries, examples are given of

an efficient utilisation of existing Lom&#233; instruments in support of the private sector

(the coffee industry in Uganda, the horticultural sector in Kenya). On the whole, however,

the Convention does not really provide a coherent, diversified and flexible set of policies

and instruments, adapted to the specific needs of the private sector (who requires a stable

environment; access to credit and venture capital, development banks for small and

medium enterprises, supportive business infrastructure, and a global investment protection

and promotion agreement). No specific resources are allocated to the private sector. The

suffocating bureaucracy at both ends is a major obstacle. The potential of the EIB and the

CDI has remained largely untapped  -- partly as a result of the way in which these

organisations are currently structured and managed.

<p>

<li>Lack of information. It is difficult to obtain relevant information on the opportunities

created by the Lom&#233; Convention for private sector development. Responsibility for

this is shared. In most countries, the private sector is not sufficiently organised to find its

way to the Lom&#233; Convention. ACP governments are often blamed for

"confiscating" information. Many feel that the Commission could have done more to

disseminate information, either through user-friendly manuals or through awareness

creating seminars.

</ul><p>

<H4>Create mechanisms for dialogue and consultation</H4>

<p>

<i>"The attitude of government must change. If it is not willing to help the private

sector, there is not much that can be done" (African private sector representative)</i>.

<p>

This is a prerequisite in establishing new public-private partnerships. By involving the private

sector in a constant and fruitful dialogue with their respective governments, it will be

possible to gradually reduce the "historic mistrust" between the two sectors. This, in turn,

would facilitate information flow, communication, participation in national policy

formulation and, related to this, a "fair and equitable" involvement in the programming and

management of Lom&#233; resources.

<p>

To this end, a new set of (formal and informal) institutional arrangements for dialogue and

consultation has to be designed. The formula of a "Social and Economic Council"  was

proposed as a possible structure to bring together the public and private sectors together.

It has a relatively sound track record in the EU and can be adapted to the ACP

environment. Experience in some ACP countries suggests that for such a Council to work,

the governance conditions must be appropriate. Different fora could be organised under

this umbrella. Membership would be open to different types of private sector actors. Other

stakeholders (trade unions, civil society organisations and academics) could be co-opted.

This type of "interface structure" would also provide a platform for a (tripartite) dialogue

with the EC (in programming national and regional indicative programmes). Linkages could

also be envisaged with counterpart organisations in the EU. In the case of small island

states, such consultation mechanisms could also be established at the  regional level. 

<p>



<H4>Provide direct support</H4>

<p>

It is now widely agreed that a "bureaucratic approach" to private sector development

makes little sense. The logic, interests and dynamics of the public and private sectors are

simply too different. For instance, private sector actors operating in the market cannot

afford the luxury to engage in cumbersome and time-consuming applications for project

funding. If private sector development is to be supported in future ACP-EU cooperation,

more decentralised management approaches are needed, combining efficiency with

functional government involvement. Different options can be envisaged:

<ul>

<li>Manage decentralised funds within a national or regional indicative programme. This

option builds on the premise that there is a genuine policy dialogue between the public and

private sectors on development strategies and related priorities in allocating external (EU)

support. In this case, it should also be possible to delegate the management of some of the

agreed programmes to private sector actors. This option has two major advantages. First,

it frames support measures to the private sector in a national policy framework. Second,

it allows for a pragmatic division of management responsibilities based on comparative

advantages. Experience indicates that this formula can work if conditions are appropriate. 

<P>

<li>Direct funding. This option proposes the creation of a separate window in favour of

private sector development. A percentage of the resources allocated to a country would

be reserved in a "private sector fund", under the direct management of the EU and its

private sector partners. Many ACP non-state actors support this solution. It reflects their

distrust of government interference and their desire for autonomy, including in their

dealings with the Commission. While this option may ensure greater flexibility and

efficiency, it also carries risks. Direct funding can undermine the legitimacy of the state.

There is a danger of supporting a multitude of uncoordinated activities, delinked from a

national policy framework. It may increase rivalry over access to funds and attract

unqualified (and unaccountable) private sector operators. Furthermore, the private sector

in most ACP countries is poorly structured to enter into this type of direct partnerships.

The Commission may find itself in a difficult position, both at policy and operational levels

(in setting priorities or in selecting "credible partners").

<p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center>Box 6.2: A Decentralised Approach to EDF

Projects</center><p>

<p>

The adoption of a decentralised approach in relation to certain EU projects (such as the

Export Development Programme in Zambia) appears to generate encouraging results in the

field. In the Zambian case, although the programme is supervised by a para-public body

(the Export Board of Zambia), the administration of the programme has been delegated

entirely to private sector operators (i.e. manufacturers' associations) who are members of

the Board, and are solely entitled to decide on the allocation of financial resources (i.e.

credit facilities) and the utilisation of technical assistance.

<p>

Those responsible for the programme at a local level claim that its success clearly lies in the

absence of interference by government in the day-to-day administration of the

programme.</table></center>

<p>

<li>Private sector trust funds. This idea is to allocate resources to independent

intermediaries, usually established as national (public) institutions. Funds would be

dispensed within the context of a national policy to organisations applying for resources on

a competitive basis. Authority would be given to a board of trustees, representing the

different parties at stake (governments, private sector, donor agency). This option makes

it possible to avoid some of the risks associated with direct funding while simplifying the

participation of private sector. In the Caribbean, for example, it is planned to open a

"private sector desk" at the Caribbean Development Bank. The desk is to be run by an

independent foundation -- a sort of trust fund whose management would be equally divided

between government and private sector representatives. 

</ul>

<p>

<H4>Adopt flexible and country-specific approaches </H4>

<p>

Private sector development is a "catch-all" phrase. It usually embraces a wide range of

actors, including the formal and informal sectors, large, medium and small enterprises and

the foreign private sector (whose role is essential in bringing foreign direct investment and

transfer of technology to sustain export).

<p>

Beyond this point, however, diversity reigns. Governance conditions, public policies, the

overall institutional environment, the roles and capacity levels of the private sector all tend

to differ from country to country. This calls for differentiated, country - or region specific

approaches. This, in turn, has major implications for the design of adequate EU policies,

implementation strategies and instruments in support of the private sector. 

<p>

In many ACP countries, the prospects of a "smooth and gradual integration into the world

economy" (Treaty of Maastricht, article 130u) are grim. If anything, marginalisation is the

order of the day. In these countries, support strategies will, inevitably, be rather low-profile

and incremental. The focus will probably be on improving the political environment and

overall capacity for (small and medium) private sector development.

<p>

The EU could provide "indirect support in the form of conditionalities whereby the private

sector is allowed to play a more meaningful role in the economy." In small Caribbean

islands dependent on bananas, the task is to help restructure the industry to ensure a

greater complementarity between trade and aid, and to support the emergence of a viable

small business sector. In the more advanced ACP economies with a highly developed

private sector (like Mauritius), it will be essential to "speed up the integration of these

economies in the globalisation processes through international trade and foreign direct

investment." 

<p>

<H4>Develop capacity at all levels</H4>

<p>

<i>"It takes time to create an entrepreneur, especially in countries where there is not a

tradition of risk taking and private sector initiative" (Caribbean private sector

representative)</i>.

<p>

The success of any attempt to widen cooperation to the private sector will depend on the

preparedness of the different actors involved to develop new institutional and human

capacities.

<p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center>Box 6.3: A Response to Organisational Problems: the Enterprise

Network</center><p>

<p>

The example of the Enterprise Network in West Africa bears witness to the role which

groups representing private interests may play in a regional perspective.  Having identified

a series of priorities for supporting the development of the private sector in the region, the

Network set itself the short-term goal of improving the capacity of its members (who are

organised in the form of national platforms) to participate in the national political dialogue.

<p>

In the medium term, and in the context of a European cooperation policy that is geared

towards a greater degree of decentralisation, the Network wishes to become one of the

EU's preferred partners and to be involved in implementing European programmes designed

to support the private sector.

</table></center><p>

First the private sector has to put its act together if it wants to be treated as a serious

partner. Depending on country conditions, the institutional agenda may comprise the

following:

<ul>

<li>building leadership qualities in the private sector (so it can assume its social role in

development);

<li>developing representative bodies which can promote the interests of the private sector

(in all its diversity) towards governments and donor agencies;

<li>creating new institutional arrangements to channel EU support;

<li>designing effective systems of monitoring, control and accountability;

<li>improving analytical capacity and negotiating skills;

<li>investing in human resource development and entrepreneurship

<li>strengthening the capacity to link up with European private sector partners.

</ul><p>

<p>

Second, capacity building has to take place in the public sector. Rather than dismantling

the state, it is necessary to develop new institutional and human capacities to facilitate the

management of reform and the functioning of a market economy in the context of the

overall development process. New skills are also needed to communicate, participate in

dialogue and arrive at joint decision-making with private sector actors. 

<p>

Third, the Commission needs to invest in capacity building, with a view to designing a more

coherent package of policies and instruments in support of the private sector and of

managing the field programmes in a decentralised and flexible way. This will require a

strengthening of its own internal capacities (through the recruitment of specialists from the

private sector), both at the level of the Delegations and in Brussels (where responsibility is

scattered over a number of different units).

<p>

<h3>Collaborating with Civil Society</h3>

<p>

<h4>Distant stakeholders ...</h4>

<p>

<i>"Our government simply refuses to involve NGO's in EU cooperation. Several

requests to get at least a copy of the National Indicative Programme were turned down"

(African NGO representative)</i>.

<p>

Civil society organisations (rural and village groupings, co-operatives, NGO's, trade unions,

human rights associations, etc.) are another set of actors that are pressing to become full-

fledged partners in ACP-EU cooperation. They want to participate both in the

implementation of the current Lom&#233; IV Convention and in the debate on the future

of this cooperation agreement. 

<p>

They too, are frustrated with the current state of affairs. Despite much rhetoric about

"people-centred and participatory development", most ACP governments are reluctant to

involve civil society in the life of the Convention. This "top-down" approach is also

perceived to prevail in regional organisations involved in EU cooperation. Structures for

dialogue at national level are found wanting. There are few opportunities for civil society

to participate in the Convention's joint institutions. Promising attempts are being made to

"open-up" the ACP-EU Joint Assembly to non-state actors, but this is a far cry from

establishing a real political dialogue between different stakeholders. The marginalisation of

civil society can be illustrated with a simple fact:  "halfway through the programming

exercise for the 8th Development Fund, the EU and ACP states have taken major decisions

on resource allocation and on priority programme areas without any efforts to either inform

or consult with non-state development actors." 

<p>

Not surprisingly, the EU is criticised by many non-state actors for not practising what it

preaches. Admittedly, efforts were made to create special schemes for them. Already under

Lom&#233; I (1975-80), community organisations could benefit from micro-projects.

The scheme may have been successful in many ACP countries, but one should realise that

micro-projects represent only a very small amount of total Lom&#233; resources (2.5%

under Lom&#233; III). Also in the 1970's, the Commission established the "co-financing"

scheme which paved the way for intensive cooperation between southern NGO's and their

northern counterparts. While the funds accruing to this scheme have increased

spectacularly, this cooperation mainly focuses on implementing projects at grassroots level -

- a task for which civil society organisations are perceived to have a comparative advantage.

However, southern NGO's in particular, want to be more than simply "cheap delivery

systems" for the implementation of projects. They also question the need to channel this

aid through European NGO's.

 

One of the main innovations of the Lom&#233; IV Convention (1990-95) was the

introduction of "decentralised cooperation." It aimed to make a wide variety of

development actors eligible to use Lom&#233; resources. It is claimed that decentralised

cooperation reflects the primary objectives of EU development cooperation (promotion of

democracy, participatory development and poverty alleviation). However, here again,

practice turns out to be quite different. Little progress has been made in implementation,

mainly because of a lack of information, political resistance from ACP states, and poor

mechanisms for follow-up. During the mid-term review of the Lom&#233; IV Convention,

there was much insistence from the European side to broaden the opportunities for non-

state actors to (directly or indirectly) benefit from Lom&#233;. Attempts were also made

to create space for upstream participation of decentralised actors in the policy and decision-

making processes of ACP-EU cooperation. This mandate has not really materialised.

Marginal openings were obtained for non-state actors to participate in the formulation and

implementation of Lom&#233;, let alone to receive direct support. There has been no

review of the monopoly position of central government agencies in allocating Lom&#233;

resources.  

<p>

The net result is a striking paradox. While it is increasingly acknowledged that civil society

organisations have a critical role to play in development, particularly at community levels

and among the large number of disadvantaged and vulnerable people, they are treated as

"secondary actors" in ACP-EU cooperation.

<p>



      <h4>... with great expectations ...</h4>

<p>

<i>"What we badly need is a Lom&#233; for the poor" (European NGO

representative)</i>.

<p>

Most civil society respondents feel that they have a major input to make in the redefinition

of ACP-EU cooperation. Through their experience in development work, civil society

organisations have accumulated a body of knowledge and expertise on how to "reach out"

to the poor. A more effective and systematic use of this know-how may help to achieve

stated ACP-EU development objectives. By associating them with national policy-making, it

may be possible to design a different set of socio-economic policies and home-grown

adjustment programmes  that are better adapted to local realities and the needs of the

"excluded" (women and youngsters). 

<p>

What do civil society organisations expect with regard to the future? What changes would

they advocate if the Convention would be radically redesigned?  Three major expectations

have been put forward:

<ul>

<li>Improve access to funds. For most civil society organisations, this is the top priority.

They want their "legitimate piece of the cake" from the Lom&#233; resources under the 8th

EDF. The experience thus gained would help them to build capacity to participate in the

"Beyond-Lom&#233; IV debate."

<p>

Two main modalities to channel these resources are proposed. A majority of non-state actors

favours direct funding. They see this as the "safest and most efficient channel", provided

"new criteria are developed to ensure the selection of legitimate, credible and accountable

organisations." The popularity of this option provides a clear indication of both their mistrust

towards governments and their desire for autonomy. Others believe the way forward is rather

to expand and refine the application of "decentralised cooperation." Ideally, this approach

puts civil society organisations in the driving seat while promoting linkages with other actors

(local governments) and central government policies. This is seen to harbour more promise

than to distribute EU resources among a multitude of civil society organisations, working in

isolation.  

<p>

<li>Forge constructive public-private partnerships. This message is primarily heard in ACP

countries where relations between government and civil society are relatively open and

collaborative. In these countries, non-state actors argue that it would be a mistake to

marginalise governments. What is at stake is rather "to redefine the kind of intervention that

is of the realm of governments and the public sector." EU cooperation can help to foster

synergies between the two sectors. According to Eastern and Southern African NGO's:

"partnership and collaboration between responsible and committed public, private and civil

sectors both within and between ACP countries, are the only way in which we can find

solutions which benefit people and protect our countries' interests." In the near future, it will

be critically important to find new ways and mechanisms to ensure this type of collaboration,

at both the policy and practical levels.

<p>

<li>Put poverty alleviation first. This is the primary political aim that civil society

organisations (including European NGO's and their networks) pursue in their advocacy work

on Lom&#233;. The focus on poverty alleviation opens a broad policy agenda. It means that

civil society organisations need to wake up and to defend the best provisions of Lom&#233;.

It invites them to undertake serious studies that assess the possible impact of trade

liberalisation for the poor (at various levels). It means putting more efforts into lobbying for

a fair consideration of the social dimensions of adjustment and debt relief. Some NGO's go

a step further and argue that what is at stake is to fundamentally challenge the neo-liberal

ideology and related globalisation processes that are seen to create poverty in both the South

and the North.

</ul>

<H4>... but poorly equipped to participate in the beyond Lom&#233; IV debate</H4>

<p>

It appears that civil society organisations have a long way to go before they can seriously

participate in the rapidly evolving debate on the future of the Lom&#233; Convention. It

is a sad paradox. Now that the political barriers to their involvement are being removed in

most ACP countries, non-state actors may find themselves unable to play a major role. Some

of the main bottlenecks preventing their participation include:

<ul>

<li>lack of awareness. Most civil society respondents admit that they had "no clue of what

Lom&#233; was all about." There is an overall lack of information and awareness on the

basic features of EU development cooperation, the main policy debates,  and the instruments,

often including those specifically designed for civil society organisations (micro-projects,

decentralised cooperation). The net result  is a kind of "apathy" towards the Lom&#233;

Convention and the whole debate on its future. 

<p>                                        

<li>Weak capacity. In many ACP countries, civil society is rather fragmented, weak in

organisational terms and poorly structured. Southern NGO's, for instance, are often young

organisations, struggling to establish an identity or to keep their projects going. Few venture

into advocacy work. Those who focus on lobbying tend to see other issues (influencing

national policies, environmental or gender issues, social development)  as more important

than a "distant thing like Lom&#233;." These organisations generally cannot mobilise the

political and analytical "critical mass"  needed to make a major dent in the discussions.

<p>

<li>Limited avenues for dialogue. Civil society organisations have few well-established

channels of communication and dialogue with their governments or with the different

European institutions (Delegations, the Commission in Brussels, the European Parliament,

etc.).

<p>                                        

<li>Fragile linkages with northern counterparts. In Europe, the NGO community spends

(a rather limited) part of its resources on advocacy work, including issues such as ACP-EU

cooperation. This work is either organised at national level or through different European

networks (NGDO Liaison Committee, Euro-Cidse, EEROSTEP, APRODEV) and thematic

networks (WIDE, EURODAD). They put quite more effort into European development

cooperation issues, often with little support from their member NGO's. On the whole,

however, European NGO's have not really been able to fully associate their southern partners

in the design and implementation of lobbying strategies. The "voice from the field" is too

seldom heard in Europe. This tends to hamper the quality and effectiveness of lobbying work. 

</ul>

<p>

The message is clear:  in the absence of information, internal capacity building, channels for

dialogue and strategic alliances with northern partners, civil society organisations are unlikely

to have much impact on the Beyond-Lom&#233; IV debate.

<CENTER><A NAME="Values and Visions"><H3>VALUES AND VISIONS</H3></A></CENTER> 

A development education project to encourage spiritual development and global awareness</H4> </CENTER> <HR>
<BODY>
<H3><B>Summary:</B></H3>
The Values and Visions project has been operating for the past 4 years to become an effective means for bringing spiritual development and global awareness to primary schools. This has taken the form of a framework, methodology and teaching activities bought to schools through an inservice training programme and in some cases through in depth work with all school staff. This experience has been encapsulated in the teachers' manual.<P> 

This project addresses a fundamental concern to develop community in schools. It builds on much that has been done in the past but is essentially innovatory. It seeks to develop community in school through an acknowledgement of the importance of shared vaues and visions; through a focus on issues of justice, peace and the environment; through recognising the spiritual development that underpins this work.<P> 


<B>The project and <A HREF="values_handbook.html">handbook</A> offer:</B><UL> <li>practical classroom activities and a methodology to bring spiritual development and global awareness into the school<BR> <li>strategies to enhance the sense of community especially where cultural and social differences are thought to be divisive<BR> <li>long term in-depth work on a whole school basis working with teachers, non teaching staff, governors and parents<BR> <li>experienced trainers some of whom are Southern ("Third World") partners and members of various faith groups</UL><P> <A HREF="values_handbookmap.html">Would you like to explore the handbook?</A><P> 


<B>The most apparent benefits were:</B><UL> <li>An increased level of staff awareness and professional confidence<BR> <li>The use of the ideas and activities were helpful on a practical level, eg in one school 'Here I Am' is being supported by the Guidelines throughout the school<BR> <li>An increased awareness around environmental studies both in terms of the level of knowledge, and in terms of care and commitment<BR> <li>Supporting work on children's behaviour: in one school Values and Visions is helping to take things forward in the areas of racism and bullying; in the other it is used to help co-operation.</ul>

<HR>
<h2 align=center>From this month's editor</h2>

<P>My God, what's happening to you? I do believe you are being seduced by
science!'<BR>
I found, still find, it hard to believe. But something unusual was happening.
And the tell-tale sign was there: a buzz of excited optimism as I related
to my patient colleagues inspiring facts about the <i>awesome</i> energy potential
of the sun, wind and tides.<BR>
<BR>
My enthusiasm wasn't there in the beginning as I ploughed my way through
piles of books and papers on 'energy'. ('Such a deadly word,' remarked a
friend and I instantly knew what he meant, pictures of pylons and faceless
men in hard hats flashing through my mind.) <BR>
<BR>
Then came the startling realization that if you had to blame one thing for
the most serious threat to life on earth today it would be: energy. Global
warming, acid rain, air pollution, radioactive waste. You name it. They
all result from the ways in which we, in the twentieth century, have chosen
to generate and use our energy. <BR>
<BR>


Editor's Picture

Hard on the heels of this insight came another, actually far more significant,
one. <i>It does not have to be this way.</i> Not at all. We can change it. The
science, the technological know-how is there. It's just that for the past
100 years or so we have chosen a certain energy path; one that relies heavily
on fossil fuels and more recently nuclear fission instead of using the sun,
wind, air, water or other 'renewable' sources. We could have done it differently.
We just didn't. <BR>
<BR>
We can do so still. Whether we will is another - a political -
matter. The more people I talked to during the course of my research the
more I came to realize that alternative energy is actually one of the most
hopeful areas to work in and write about today. Seduced by science? Maybe.
But if one is going to be seduced by science it may as well be the natural,
holistic and life-affirming type rather than the divisive, invasive, life-denying
one.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps I make change sound easy, which of course it isn't. And it's not
just conservative attitudes and vested interests holding us back. It's also
that we are not operating on a level playing-field. If we are talking about
changing the world's energy systems we have to realize that the industrial
North is glutted with energy, using seven times as much per capita as the
South consumes. The South is starved of the cheap energy it desperately
needs to fuel economic growth and haul itself out of poverty. So Northern
and Southern priorities are likely to be quite different. <BR>
<BR>
To explore this tension I have used a fictional device and created two characters,
Gloria Thembisa from South Africa and Claire Green from England. This magazine
follows them in their exploration of various energy paths. The device is
fictive but the substance of the magazine is factual, with contributions
from other writers interspersed with the narrative. Special thanks go to
Sara Chamberlain for help with this research. <BR>
<BR>
And now it's time to unfasten your mind-belts. The journey is about to begin.<BR>

<b>Thursday 23 May</b><br>
<i>From webmaster@saudhouse.com</i><p>
<p>
<h3>Corruption in the House of Saud</h3>


INTERNET-Cyberspace  Committee Against Corruption in Saudi 
Arabia (C.A.C.S.A.) announced today the posting of its message and 
mission statement on a new site to be found under www.saudhouse.com.<p>


        www.saudhouse.com has three aims : <ul><li>1) to expose the corruption 
and the human rights abuses and lack of women's rights in Saudi Arabia. 
<li>2) to convince the United Nations to pass laws against corruption 
similar to those laws that protect humans from crimes and laws that 
allow the IMF and the World Bank fiscal control of a mismanaged society. 
<li>3) to build grassroots support in universities around the globe to help 
us in sending a strong message to our elected officials to stop 
corruption in Saudi Arabia.</ul>


        When a government is corrupt, the people that supported that 
government suffer the most. In a corrupt society, you have lower 
standards of living because you have monopolies and oligopolies and 
mafia-style inner circle of the priviliged few at the expense of the 
unpriviliged majority. In a vibrant democratic society like Israel, when 
a company makes $100 million in profits, the money is distributed 
amongst stockholders from all walks of life, in Saudi Arabia, when a 
company makes $100 million, that money gets deposited in a Swiss bank 
account owned by one Prince never to benefit the society at large. That 
is what is happening in Saudi Arabia and that is why CACSA exists today.<p>


        Saudi Arabia today is at the brink of bankrupty thanks to the 
mismanagement and corruption of King Fahd and Prince Sultan. If this 
continues, it will not be long before the US Congress is asked to bail 
out Saudi Arabia in order to save "our interests". This bail out will be 
very expensive indeed and to be paid for by US taxpayers. CACSA would 
like to see this avoided by passing laws to take voluntary fiscal 
control from the Saudis before it is too late. The blueprint of these 
laws is being put into effect today by the UN in Iraq. King Fahd, who 
had a stroke in November 1995, is willing to give up fiscal control with 
enough pressure from the US and the world community. 
<p>

        Saudi Arabia holds 25% of world oil reserves. Its style of 
government is a monarchy with the King having total control over 
the daily routine of the country. Population is around 15 million 
with about 5 million in expatriate workers. Its annual budget is around 
$50 billion.

<b><li>Housing Without Houses<br>
Participation, flexibility, enablement</b><br>

<i>Nabeel Hamdi</i><br>

This book presents a wide range of innovative concepts and

practical methods for housing together with illustrative examples

of actual projects, where resources are scarce, demand is high,

urgency is acute, and where uncertainty is a way of life. It

shows that under these conditions, efficient practice depends

upon methods that promote rather than hinder spontaneity,

improvization, and incremental development.<p>



The author explores what the changes taking place internationally

in housing policy are, why and how they have emerged, and what

impact they now have on design and on the attitudes, skills,

methods, and tools of designers.<p> 



The book illustrates how plans can emerge in action without a

preponderance of user surveys or master planning, and how the

three themes of participation, flexibility, and enablement can

together improve the efficiency of practice and promote an

architecture of co-operation.<br>

aim of the course is to provide much-needed trade information in

simple language, with numerous, clear illustrations. It draws on

the expertise of fieldworkers who have devised simple building

methods appropriate to a rural community, and is the product of

years of experimentation with different methods. <p>

<b><li>Building With Bamboo<br>
A handbook (second edition) </b><br>
<i>Jules J.A. Janssen</i><br>
 This revised handbook brings together the practical experience of engineers working in the field, and research programmes testing the properties of bamboo. The book shows how bamboo has been used in different designs in developing countries and describes the varying properties and uses of different types of bamboo. The author shows how bamboo can be harvested, seasoned and jointed to form walls, doors and windows, roofs, floors, ceilings, roof trusses and bridges, and how to weave bamboo. <p>

The new edition updates and corrects the text of the first edition; and includes a detailed case study of the extensive experience of Costa Rica in bamboo construction. <p> 

Praise for the first edition:<br>
<i>'Written in clear, simple English . . . illustrations are well labelled and captioned ... [this book] should serve the needs of many people who are using bamboo for construction purposes in the developing countries.'	-- A.N. Rao </i> BambooNewsletter</i><br>

<b><li>Manual for Urban Environmental Management</b><br>
This manual grew out of the work of German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) in Nepal and Thailand.  Although developed in Asia, the methodology on which it is based may also be useful throughout the Third World.  The manual defines urban environmental management as "concerned with creating a healthy and pleasant physical environment within which we can all enjoy our lives...and ensuring that we look after our physical resources in a sustainable way and, as far as possible, eliminate, or at least, minimize, pollution" (page 2).<p>

  The manual explains the main stages through which a national urban environmental action
planning programme might be launched and institutionalized.  Such a programme seeks to raise awareness and knowledge of environmental problems and their potential solutions among policy makers and urban communities.  As such, it does not require a large financial outlay on urban infrastructure projects: based on their experience in Asia, the authors argue that no more than three or four full-time staff are needed to initiate a programme of this nature.  They also stress that the main ingredient for its success is "widespread commitment to its goals, effective cooperation and resource-sharing, and the mobilisation of local communities" (page 13); similarly, a key principle behind the ideas contained in the manual is that they should be adaptable to suit the perspective of a particular country and culture.<p>

Each of the four stages of the proposed programme is given a section in the manual.  In the first stage a national workshop to discuss issues and implementation strategy is organized; this should ideally be attended by representatives from the national and local government, relevant non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and experts in the field.  The
manual suggests ideas for organizing the workshop and a range of issues to be discussed, with brief descriptions of each one.<p>
 
Finding an appropriate institutional base and identifying the environmental problems in the municipalities selected for the programme are some of the goals of stage two.  Other goals include outlining possible approaches to solving these problems locally, documenting good examples of initiatives already taken by municipalities and identifying possible sources of assistance to help municipalities solve their environmental problems.  The manual suggests guidelines to assist municipalities and local communities in reaching these goals.<p>

In the third stage a small number of municipalities are selected to implement a pilot environmental action planning process.  At the end of this initial testing period, the materials and implementation procedures are evaluated in a workshop before their national dissemination.  The final stage of the process involves developing training programmes for
improved urban environmental management.  By this stage, deficiencies in skills and knowledge among the different actors involved in the process would have become apparent; the manual suggests ways in which relevant training institutions can be identified to provide the needed skills.<p>

An epilogue discusses concepts of environment and sustainability, while an annex outlines the ways in which the problems of domestic sanitation and resource management were tackled in the course of the technical cooperation projects in Nepal and Thailand.<br>

<b><li>Desconcentracion, tecnologia y localizacion industrial en Mexico
(Deconcentration, technology and industrial location in Mexico)</b><br>
<i>Gustavo Garza</i><br>
For several decades, industrial estates have been an important instrument of spatial policy for governments in both the North and the South.  Often, government support for a range of infrastructure or zoning projects within the somewhat broad category of "industrial estate", has been designed to slow down the growth rate of metropolitan areas perceived by
politicians and policy makers as being too congested.<p>

This book examines in detail the policies of the Mexican government towards industrial estates during the period 1953-1986.  The author and his research team scanned the literature published in Mexico between
1940 and 1990 to find 1,728 bibliographic references within the general theme of urban and regional studies - the vast majority published after 1970.  After noting the lack of systematic research on the evolution of urban and regional planning in Mexico, the author points out
that an important element of that evolution was the policy launched in 1953 with the establishment of Ciudad Sahag£n, the first industrial estate built in the country.  <p>

However, the policy remained erratic and not always at the forefront of efforts to steer demographic and economic growth away from Mexico City's powerful pull.  For the late 1980s, the research team had difficulties accounting for the precise number of industrial estates built in
that period.  By the end of the initial inventory, they concluded that 110 estates and 20 cities were still in operation at the time of the study.  Much of the research draws on surveys from the administrators of 127 of these and from a sample of 68 industrial establishments in 16
estates and industrial cities.<p>

The book consists of 11 chapters, four methodological appendices and a large bibliography.  These chapters consider government policies towards industrial estates in the more general context of urban and regional policies in Mexico; they outline a conceptual framework for application to the Mexican case; they examine in detail the main features of
Mexico's industrial estates; examine the usefulness of this instrument in promoting decentralized urban development and in advancing the development of backward regions; assess the performance of the establishments that chose to locate in industrial estates,
particularly as it refers to their locational choice; and, finally, consider the relevance of technological parks of the kind found in the industrialized nations of Europe and Japan as centres for technological innovation.  <br>

<b><li>Cities and Sustainable Development</b><br>
<i>Diana Mitlin and David Satterthwaite</i><br>
This is the background paper commissioned by Global Forum '94 for the five-day conference it organized on "Cities and Sustainable Development" in Manchester, UK.  Delegations from 50 cities around the world attended this conference, with representatives in each city delegation drawn from citizen groups and NGOs, trade unions, city government and the private sector. <p>

The paper is divided into nine sections.  The first discusses the potential that cities have for contributing to sustainable development and what has to be done to realize this potential.  The second considers the main goals that are part of sustainable development and how these relate to cities and to the seven themes chosen for discussion at Global Forum '94.<p>
 
This is followed by sections on these seven themes: resource use; livelihoods; basic needs and urban poverty; environment and health; transport and communications; finance for sustainable development; and governance and institutions.  An annex considers the extent to which Agenda 21 (the main "action plan" coming out of the Earth Summit in 1992) addresses urban issues.

<b><li>Urban Poverty and the Environment in the South Pacific</b><br>
<i>Jenny Bryant</i><br>
This book examines urban poverty issues and the changing nature of the urban environment in the South Pacific.  The author begins by discussing the nature of the relationship between poverty and the environment, and between development and sustainability objectives within the South Pacific in general, and places the urban issue within a broader context.  <p>

The discussion examines both the objectives of economic development
and "new" development institutions such as NGOs and community based organizations.  The book focuses mainly on "...the linkages between changing environments and increasing poverty in the urban centres of the South Pacific nations" (page 5) with a bias away from Papua New Guinea and towards the smaller islands.<p>

The main text starts with an introductory chapter on changing environmental management and urbanization trends in the South Pacific.  In the second half of this chapter, the author considers definitions of poverty and measures of poverty within the localities being
considered.  The following chapter examines a number of aspects of the urban environment including waste disposal and water supply facilities, solid and industrial waste disposal, hazardous wastes and atmospheric pollution, and impacts on health.  <p>

Separate sections consider economic strategies relevant to the environment, the specific role of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme and environmental legislation and management. <p>

Chapter four focuses on urban poverty and examines the scale of poverty in the South Pacific, and related factors such as health, education and economic change; poverty issues related to the urban habitat are considered separately.  The chapter ends with a discussion
on policy related issues including the role of government and poverty alleviation strategies.<p>
 
Chapter five consists of a case study on poverty and urban environments in Fiji, and the final chapter considers "positive approaches" to the problems associated with urban poverty and environmental degradation.<p>

  The author concludes that, while the problems are complex
"...there are .... countless ways of improving the lot of the poor, but only if there is the political will , and only if the poor have the opportunities and capacity to participate" (page 94).

<b><li>How Common is Our Future? <br>
Human Settlements, Development and Environment</b><br>
<i>Habitat International Coalition</i><br>
This book presents the proceedings of a Forum organized by the Habitat International Coalition (HIC) which took place in Mexico in March 1991 on the relationship between environment, development and human settlements. The aim was to "...advance understanding
and promote consciousness as to the important role that the problems of human settlements and housing have in the determination of adequate strategies for sustainable development."<p>
 
The report is divided into four sections.  The first serves as an introduction and outlines HIC's main concerns and aims, and places the Forum within the context of the report of the World Commission for Environment and Development (also known as the Brundtland Commission), "Our Common Future" and the UNCED meeting in Brazil in 1992.<p>
 
It clarifies the main issues of: the right to habitat for all; poverty and the use and distribution of resources for a sound environment; local-global relations; the regional dimension of urban and rural areas; and environment and democracy.<p>

The second section presents the papers which illustrate the various facets of the Forum's theme.  These include; a general overview of the links between human settlements, environment and sustainable development; and papers on the preparations for the UNCED meeting in Brazil in 1992; the relationship between cities and sustainable development;
environmental challenges of human settlements and urbanization; urban quality of life; popular urban ecology;  the use of human rights law to improve living conditions; the scope and limits of municipal action, the relationship between local governments and organized society, and innovative experiences in public policy; the urban popular movement and the environment; and, finally, women, shelter and environment and the search for sustainable alternatives by the urban poor.<p>

The third section presents the results of debates from eight working groups, with themes closely allied to the papers, the fourth section presents the final statements made at the Forum, and the report ends with a list of participants.<br>

<b><li>The Latin American City</b><br>
<i>Alan Gilbert</i><br>
This book consists of eight chapters, each considering different aspects of the Latin American city.  Chapter one presents short descriptions of Bogot , Caracas, Guadalajara, Rio de Janeiro and La Paz to highlight the diversity of Latin American cities but also to point to commonalities - for instance the common language (except for Brazil) and cultural roots laid
during almost 300 years of rule by Spain and Portugal.  Chapter two describes the growth of the Latin American city from its pre-Columbian and colonial heritage to the present.  This includes the rapid expansion from the 1930s or 1940s to around 1980 that coincided with
large increases in national populations, sustained economic growth and industrial development, and the slower growth in the 1980s with stagnant economies and falling birth
 <p>
Chapter three describes "the move to the city", including what fuelled rural to urban migration, the different forms it takes (and how these have changed over time), and the impact of the economic recession of the 1980s.<p>

Chapter four reviews employment and work, especially
the changes evident in the 1980s.  Special attention is also given to the situation of women
and to child labour.<p>
 
Chapter five, on housing strategies, describes the major changes in recent decades including the large increases in the proportion of people living in owner-occupied dwellings (even if most developed illegally) and the large expansion of city areas. <p>

Chapter six, on urban management, notes that often too much emphasis is given to "horror stories" and that, in general, infrastructure and service provision have expanded greatly. It also gives examples of how poorer groups are generally the worst served.  <p>

There are sub-sections on transport, pollution and disasters.  The current fashion for privatization of services is also critically
reviewed. Chapter seven describes the different protests that have taken place and discusses why protest in the form of conflict has not been more common,  given the scale of poverty and inequality.  It also describes different measures by which governments have dampened
protest - including repression, clientalism and the cooption of leaders.<p>

Chapter eight considers what the author suggests are the rather poor prospects for "The Future of the City."  He notes that "...in general, Latin America's cities face a much more optimistic future than do cities in most parts of Africa or those in many parts of Asia.  But much depends on the rate of economic growth, without which it is difficult to improve most
people's lives, and much on better and fairer government" (page 169).   In each chapter, boxes are used to give examples - for instance in the chapter on urban protest are there are boxes on a description of Superbarrio in Mexico City, a portrait of a community leader in Bogota, a description of the protest in Caracas in February 1989, and "How to fend off
protest; the Solidarity Programme in Mexico".

<b><li>El Futuro de la Capital<br> 
(The Future of Bogota, Colombia's Capital City)</b><br>
<i>Various authors</i><br>
These are the first four published volumes to have come out of a two-year programme involving Colombian specialists in a major research exercise designed to provide "a vision of the desirable future for Colombia's capital city for the first decade of the twenty-first century."  More publications are planned, but nearly 30 are already available in unpublished
form covering five major areas of the city's present and future development: social and economic issues; housing, infrastructure, utilities and social services; physical development and the environment; local government; and culture.<p>

The studies were prepared by specialist teams and their conclusions were discussed at public meetings with government officials and non-governmental organizations.  The four volumes have a common format and range in length from 110 to 210 pages.  In all cases, past and future population trends, and spatially and socially disaggregated data on income and employment are used as the basis to understand the present situation and to forecast developments to the year 2010.  The studies include a diagnosis of the key issues relating to
the sector, present institutional arrangements, possible future scenarios, and concrete proposals for implementation by present and future administrations.  The conclusions suggest that multi-disciplinary approaches are the more effective way of dealing with such issues.<p>

Particular attention is given to existing social inequalities.  Although the city's inhabitants have benefited from very real improvements in living standards since population growth peaked in the early 1970s, in 1985 nearly 15 per cent of the city's households still lived in overcrowded conditions, and 6.5 per cent lacked connection to one or more of three basic services: drinking water, sewage, or electricity.  A UNICEF-UNDP funded study, in
the same year, found that the basic needs of 23 per cent of the population were still unmet.<p>

Although run independently as a non-profit organization, until December 1992, Mision Siglo XXI had the financial backing of the mayor's office and the results of these studies were to have been incorporated in a medium-term metropolitan development plan.  If maintained, this scheme would have allowed the staff of the Mision to regularly monitor changes in some key areas of the city's development.  Such a scheme did not materialize,
but the city's future mayors and, indeed, its citizens, now have a set of documents which should help them identify the most pressing issues in building a more desirable future for the city. <br>

<b><li>Nairobi's Informal Settlements: an inventory</b><br>
<i>by Matrix Development Consultants</i><br>
This report aims to "...provide accurate information on the location and characteristics of informal settlements in Nairobi... to be used as a basis for formulating policies and strategies for the city... in particular for informal settlements."  The settlements were grouped into seven areas corresponding to the city's administrative divisions and, using aerial
photography, ground visits and a literature survey, information was gathered for each division and is presented in this inventory.<p>


The first section introduces the objective, organization of the report and the methodology, followed by a short overview of the city of Nairobi.  This is followed by a definition of "informal settlements" and an analysis of various characteristics including: population growth; economic survival including income levels and generation; the provision of basic urban services including water supply, sanitation, drainage and garbage collection; education; and the implications for health of life in the informal settlements.<p>

The next section is the actual inventory.  For each of the seven divisions information is given on the following: location and history; population; housing conditions; infrastructure and services including water, sanitation, electricity, refuse disposal; access roads and transportation; health, education, church and social facilities; economic activities and sources of income; and community based organizations and NGOs which operate in the area.<p>

Annex one gives a list of references; annex two outlines the aerial photography and mapping procedure, and explains how population estimates were arrived at; and annex three gives a long list of voluntary organizations which operate in Nairobi, and includes details of the activities they undertake.  A final section consists of a map showing all informalsettlements in Nairobi, and larger scale maps of five typical settlements with greater detail.<br>

<b><li>Towards a Sustainable Urban Environment: The Rio de Janeiro Study</b><br>
<i>Edited by Alcira Kreimer, Thereza Lobo, Braz Menezes, Mohan Munasinghe and Ronald Parker</i><br>
This study provides a broad and detailed description of environmental problems and their underlying causes in Rio de Janeiro.  It is one of a series of studies of metropolitan areas in Brazil, Turkey and the Philippines being undertaken by the World Bank, the United
Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat); and is based on ten papers that were presented at a seminar in November 1992 organized by the Brazilian Institute for Municipal Administration.  The papers are presented
in four sections. <p>
 
Section I has an introductory paper that summarizes the most serious environmental problems in Rio de Janeiro and their underlying causes - and why the different levels of government have been unable to address these problems. This includes a description of environmental change within the wider region and of the historic roots of contemporary
social and environmental problems.  Section II, entitled "the conceptual framework", consists of two papers.  The first describes how Rio de Janeiro's real comparative advantages are its natural beauty and its potential for higher living standards, at a lower cost than other
Brazilian cities.  It also describes how public policy has failed to protect and promote these comparative advantages.  The second paper describes the concepts and tools used in coastal zone management and their use within the metropolitan region.<p>
  
Section III consists of four papers which consider different aspects of the institutional and financial framework.  The first describes the legal and institutional framework for environmental policy and the inadequacy of its implementation.  The second paper describes the development of the institutional framework for urban policy and some of its past and
current failings.  The third reviews government financing and expenditure on the environment in Brazil and Rio de Janeiro.  The fourth paper reviews recent research on urban environmental issues undertaken in Rio de Janeiro.  Section IV has three papers on "operational experience and technological issues".  The first describes the initial two years
of the "Rio reconstruction project" that was a response to the floods and landslides in 1988.<p>
 
The second describes how the relationship developed between the World Bank and the different government institutions in Brazil for World Bank funded work in Rio.  The final paper considers the issue of appropriate technologies for urban services in Rio de Janeiro. The report includes text boxes throughout, covering such subjects as the views of
NGOs, the basic sanitation programme for Guanabara Bay and an overview of emergency planning in industrial installations.<br>

<b><li>The Struggle for Nairobi</b><br>
<i>Terry Hirst assisted by Davinder Lamba</i><br>
This is a large format book that tells the history of Nairobi and its population and the city's changing relationship with its wider environment, in words and pictures in the form of a
"documentary comic book."  Although the information is presented, as illustrated above, in the form of a comic book,  it contains a level of detail and analysis both on the city's history and on its contemporary problems and underlying causes that will surprise many readers, including those who are familiar with Nairobi.  <p>

The text includes many maps that show how Nairobi developed over time - starting with maps showing the geological and ecological context and moving onto different maps showing how the city developed 1899-1905, 1906-1926, 1927-46, the 1948 masterplan, 1964-1983 and what the city is like in the early 1990s.<p>
 
Its coverage extends up to the Nairobi City Convention organized in July 1993, attended by 800 people, which was the first public consultation on Nairobi's future.  It was initiated by the former Mayor, Steve Mwangi and a committee of Nairobi citizens.

<b><li>Housing - Evictions<br>
Destruction by Design - Housing Rights Violations in Tibet</b><br>
<i>Scott Leckie</i><br> 
This report considers how the "...housing and planning measures practised by China have resulted in large-scale violations of the internationally recognized housing rights of the Tibetan people".  In later sections, the author outlines an alternative development strategy
for Tibetans.  After an introductory chapter which briefly outlines why the report was written and the legal status of Tibet, the report is divided into three sections.  In section one, the author outlines China's housing rights obligations under international law with an analysis of citizens' housing rights under this law.<p>

Section two examines the actual housing reality in contemporary Tibet.  Divided into several chapters, this section considers a number of issues including housing rights since 1949.  Subsequent chapters consider how four Chinese strategies have prevented access to housing rights, namely, population transfer, the allocation and provision of housing resources, Beijing's subsidies to Tibet, and Chinese views on living conditions.  China's housing, planning and development policies in Tibet have marginalized the Tibetan population politically, economically, socially and culturally.  And the report explores how these processes have affected the living and housing conditions, and housing rights of the Tibetan people, with particular reference to the capital, Lhasa.  Also considered is the use
of housing as a means of social control by the Chinese government.<p>

Section three examines housing rights violations in Tibet. Chapter eight identifies "...14 specific distinctions between housing and planning policies and practices in China (concerning Chinese nationals) and in Tibet (concerning Tibetans and Chinese migrants)..." and lists those housing rights texts and legal provisions which have been violated.  The
author outlines 20 recommendations to the Chinese government in order to prevent future housing rights violations.  Further chapters discuss possible international mechanisms for examining housing rights in Tibet and for preventing future violations.  The report ends with a selected bibliography and an annex giving details of legal sources of housing rights.

<i>Adrian Lawrence<br>
WC/94/56</i><br>
Project work in Bolivia, Mexico and Thailand, to investigate the impact of rapid urbanisation on different types of shallow aquifer in varied climatic environments, is reported. Increased recharge and declining groundwater levels result from poorly controlled urban growth, reflecting leakage of wastewaters and increased abstraction of groundwater. Elevated nitrate and chloride concentrations and contamination of groundwaters by pathogens are also described. A follow-up study investigating impacts on deep aquifers is in progress.<p>

<b><li>Networks for Urban Action</b><br>
Effective communication is one of the key tools for fostering a sense of common purpose and developing links which are of value to all stakeholders.  The Urban Management Programme for Asia and the Pacific (UMPAP) has released a guidebook that aims to facilitate networking amongst organisations working on urban issues.  Networks for Urban Action lists major global and regional initiatives that have an impact on the Asia/Pacific region.  <p>


The document provides a guide to which organisations are active, in what field and where, giving brief descriptions of the programme(s) and contact information. It is hoped that in time, this information will be made available electronically. <br>

<b><li>World Urbanisation Prospect: the 1994 Revision</b><br>

Estimates and projections are recognised tools for developing plans and stratagies in both urban and rural development circles.  The Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations has published the results of its revisions to projections on urban and rural populations and urban agglomerations for major areas, regions and countries of the world.  The publication analyses growth patterns or urban settlements and provides comparative figures on size and distribution, in addition to country-specific information sources together with definitions of urban populations used in each nation.  Targetted for use by city managers and urban planners.<br>

<b><li>Thirsty Cities: Water, Sanitation and the Urban Poor</b><br>

On World Water Day in 1994, Wateraid published a report entitled Mega-Slums: the coming sanitary crisis, which sounded a warning about modern urban growth.<p>

This year, Habitat II - the UN's second global conference on Human Settlements will be held in Istanbul.  Many of the issues set out in Mega-Slums will be raised during the Conference debates on what is now termed the 'brown agenda': the environment of urban settlements.  Rapid urban growth requires new considerations of the ways in which space and amenities should be managed so that city and townscape provide a liveable and healthy environment.<p>

Wateraid have recently issued a briefing note Thirsty Cities: Water, Sanitation and the Urban Poor for World Water Day 1996 (22nd March), providing an update of the facts concerning the sanitary crisis facing residents and authorities in many parts of the urban South.  It sets out the key changes in infrastructural policy needed to bring the crisis under control, and examines the recent record of policy and practice for signs of improvement.<br>

<b><li>Cities and Structural Adjustment</b><br>

<i>Edited by Nigel Harris & Ida Fabricius, DPU, University College London</i><br>

Cities and structural adjustment addresses the challenges faced in the management of major cities throughout the world as they adjust to economic reform and, in particular, to becoming more open to the processes operating in worldwide markets.  Based on substantial case studies of cities in the developed and developing world, several themes are drawn out, extending from structural economic change to policy reactions, new city initiatives, management, planning and finance.<br>

<b><li>Highway and traffic engineering in developing countries</b><br>
<i>Edited by Bent Thagesen<br>
Published 1996 by E & FN Spon </i><br>
This recently published book provides a Ôone-stop shopÕ of information for all those working in the highways sub-sector in developing countries. It is written in 25 chapters, covering highway planning, traffic, geometric design, drainage, pavements, construction, maintenance and development assistance. The editor, who is Professor of Highway Engineering at the Danish Technical University, has drawn together contributions from a number of authors, who are known internationally in relevant fields. It provides a comprehensive textbook on the subject.<p>

The book recognises that developing countries have different natural conditions to those of industrialised countries in temperate climates. Its coverage of traditional highway engineering subjects of planning, design and construction reflects this. Moreover, its focus reflects the fact that the institutional and financial situations are also likely to be very different in the countries of interest. It is refreshing to see subjects such as user behaviour and safety, maintenance management, development assistance, institutional strengthening and training covered. This sets the book apart from others on the subject.<p>

The book draws heavily on TRL's research and publications funded under ODA's TDR programme, but has included additional material that is based on project experience from consultants and contractors working in the field. The result is a practical and authoritative text that will be of wide use to practitioners and students alike. <br>

<b><li>Engineering in emergencies - A practical guide for relief workers</b><br>
<i>by Jan Davis and Robert Lambert<br>
Published by IT Publications on behalf of RedR, 1995</i><br>
The Foundation of RedR (Register of engineers for disaster relief) in the early 1980Õs was stimulated by the need for qualified, motivated engineers to work for relief agencies in disaster situations. Since its foundation, RedR has supplied engineers for several hundred assignments with over 20 agencies worldwide. Its profile has risen dramatically in the last 5 years following the plight of the Kurds in the aftermath of the Gulf war, and more recently the crisis in Rwanda.<p>

The book, funded in part by the ODA for RedR, is aimed at engineers in disaster situations and covers all aspects of disaster relief work in which they may be involved. The early chapters discuss the various aspects common to disaster emergencies and the way in which the international relief agencies operate in response to such circumstances. The book therefore provides invaluable guidance to engineers who probably have little experience of providing humanitarian assistance in emergencies.<p>

Moving through the various management and logistical issues, the authors then address technical aspects of disaster relief work. A major contribution of engineers comes in providing safe water and sanitation in situations where vast numbers of people exist in overcrowded areas with little infrastructure. Moreover, engineers are often required to ensure that access to camps is available and so chapters on roads, simple bridges and the planning of refugee camps are provided. The chapter on roads and bridges draws extensively on guidelines developed at TRL under ODAÕs TDR programme.<br>

<b><li>Culture, Cash and Housing<br>
Community and tradition in low-income housing</b></b><br>
<i>Maurice Mitchell and Andy Bevan</i><br>
This book examines the role of cultural tradition and the local environment in determining a community's attitude towards housing and its construction. It offers practical advice to enable planners and implementers of building projects (including development agencies) to effectively assess the community's needs and the factors which shape their requirements for change.
<p>
While there is a sizeable technical literature available on low-cost building, this book focuses on community involvement. It examines the issue of housing as a basic human need and puts the subject into a social and cultural context, whether this applies to traditional rural housing or to the problems of an urban population.

<p>
<b>Extract from <i>Culture, Cash and Housing: </b></i>
<p>
<b>The origin of planning regulations and building standards</b>
<p>
In the West, public health, building control and planning regulations originated as a response to the urban squalor and the typhoid, cholera and tuberculosis outbreaks in the early phases in industrialisation and urban living, or indeed to loss of life in urban disasters, such as major fires or the collapse of large structures. In most cases, they reflected democratic pressures within a society that was already predominantly urban. (In passing we should note that, even during the mass housing drive of the Victorian era in Britain, the efforts of the private sector, the charitable housing trusts for the poor, and company housing measures were complemented by a considerable degree of self-help, for example through savings movements.)
<p>
In general, the planning, building and public health regulations of that era reflected the needs of a highly urban society at a given stage of economic development. In the main, it was these self-same standards, with marginal adaptations for tropical conditions, which were introduced by colonial administrators into urban areas in the colonies in the first third of the twentieth century (for example, Nairobi Municipal Council's Building and Planning Regulations of 1926).
<p>
However, these regulations applied only to the central or wealthy suburban areas frequented by the Europeans. They were deemed to be appropriate to the needs of this same small elite and reflected the social and economic possibilities open to that elite. These regulations did not apply, and were never designed to apply, to the majority of the people.
<p>
In the double standards of European and non-European areas and controls, we see, in most cases, the origins of the official and the unofficial city, and the inappropriateness of colonial regulations for solving the mass housing problems of the urban poor of developing countries today. Even where this problem is fully recognised by the planning community - or even by the national government of the country - it may prove to be very difficult to overcome inertia, inherited attitudes and conflicting professional interests in rewriting and simplifying these regulations.
<p>
For example, a major seminar entitled 'Building By-Laws and Planning Regulations' was held at the Milimani Hotel in Nairobi, 27 and 29 November 1990, sponsored by ITDG (Intermediate Technology Development Group) and hosted by the Ministry of Lands and Housing and the Housing and Development Unit of the University of Nairobi. The consensus view of all present was that existing building regulations are inappropriate to the real needs of urban development in Kenya and that, in particular, some of the standards were so unrealistically high that they were an obstacle to the promotion of policies of urban improvement and low-cost housing provision.
<p>
Even so, the seminar proceedings revealed that the Ministry of Health had felt duty-bound, because of existing legal provisions regulating building, to take court action against a new housing scheme at Nyahururu because it proposed to install dry pit latrines - forbidden in a recognised housing scheme in a municipality - as a reasonable low-cost alternative to high-cost sewerage. In fairness, it should also be pointed out that there are examples from Kenya, such as the large Koma Rock low-cost housing scheme in Nairobi, where a more imaginative, flexible and well co-ordinated attitude to the application of relevant building standard has been displayed by the various government departments.
<p>
<b>Self-help in an urban context</b>
<p>
Self-help is the only viable route for most people in solving their housing problems in the cities of the South. Most newcomers to urban life bring with them a self-build tradition. In its original, rural context, this tradition may be very conservative, rooted in custom and deeply traditional.
<p>
In the urban context, however, self-build is forced to become much more inventive and innovative, using new materials and solving new problems of scale and complexity, often involving sophisticated co-operation with neighbours in the fields of building and social action. One of the real challenges of the 1990s and first years of the next century will be to find a planning approach which is able to raise standards of housing and public health by working with that self-build tradition, rather than by working against it.
<p>
We develop these points more fully in chapter two, but, almost certainly, this approach will utilise the following methods:
<p>
<ul>
<li>acceptance of the value of an incremental approach to urban self-built housing, that is allowing people to build a minimal one- or two-room dwelling initially, if that is all they can afford, and planning to allow space for additional building (at the back or side of the lot, or a second storey if adequate foundations have been laid);
<li>guaranteeing security of land tenure as the best way of encouraging self-help upgrading of dwellings and communal areas and services. (Note: successful scheme for land-share as an alternative to eviction of squatters exist in a number of countries, notably Thailand); and 
<li>use of site and services schemes, with municipal authorities concentrating on the provision of pedestrian access, drainage, sanitation, lighting and water supply for self-build communities. 
</ul>
<p>
This is a positive alternative to squandering scarce resources on complete building of estates which will be so expensive that they will only be accessible to the relatively wealthy few and probably located too far from work (formal or informal) for the poorest sections of the population.<br>

<H3>Conditions institutionnelles et manag&eacute;riales requises au

&eacute;ditorial</H3><BR>



<P>

par <I>Stanley Please</I>

<P>

Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,

2(1) avril 1994: page 2 </CENTER></I><HR>



<P>

La gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement a &eacute;t&eacute;

d&eacute;finie cette derni&egrave;re d&eacute;cennie comme sujet

d'&eacute;tude afin que soit abord&eacute;e la question de savoir

<I>comment </I>les politiques sont formul&eacute;es et mises en

oeuvre, par opposition &agrave; la question de savoir <I>quelles

</I>sont les politiques &agrave; poursuivre. Le th&egrave;me de

la coop&eacute;ration et de l'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales

en Afrique demande assur&eacute;ment une &eacute;tude dans ce

contexte.

<P>

Actuellement presque tout le monde reconna&icirc;t les avantages

que pr&eacute;senterait l'accroissement de la coop&eacute;ration

et de l'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales en tant qu'objectif

politique. M&ecirc;me la Banque mondiale, au d&eacute;part sceptique,

voire hostile, marque d&eacute;sormais son soutien. Toutefois,

les partisans les plus pers&eacute;v&eacute;rants et les plus

enthousiastes d'une plus grande coop&eacute;ration, aussi bien

en tant que but politique que comme moyen de stimuler la croissance

&eacute;conomique, sont d&eacute;courag&eacute;s par les r&eacute;sultats

obtenus depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance. La question cruciale n'est

donc plus <I>quel </I>est l'objectif &agrave; atteindre, mais

bien <I>comment </I>atteindre cet objectif.

<P>

Le message g&eacute;n&eacute;ral qui &eacute;mane des articles

de la pr&eacute;sente &eacute;dition du Bulletin est le suivant:

les d&eacute;cisions du haut vers le bas provenant des institutions

r&eacute;gionales ne repr&eacute;senteront gu&egrave;re plus que

l'affectation de politiciens et les pieux espoirs des bureaucrates

r&eacute;gionaux, &agrave; moins de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une

adaptation des institutions nationales et des processus administratifs,

de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; garantir l'int&eacute;gration des politiques

et des programmes r&eacute;gionaux dans les prises de d&eacute;cisions

nationales, c'est-&agrave;-dire, &agrave; moins que ce processus

ne devienne aussi un processus du bas vers le haut.

<P>

Mais les collaborateurs ne gonflent pas le r&eacute;cit des tribulations

de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale. Au contraire, des histoires

de r&eacute;ussite limit&eacute;e et mitig&eacute;e sont rapport&eacute;es

d'Afrique australe (Goodison et Nee), d'Afrique de l'Ouest (Deme)

et de l'initiative transfrontali&egrave;re en Afrique orientale,

en Afrique australe et dans l'Oc&eacute;an Indien (Mansoor). Elles

ont toutes demand&eacute; l'engagement effectif d'acteurs du bas

vers le haut -- des minist&egrave;res nationaux, des organismes

publics, du secteur priv&eacute;. C'est &eacute;galement la le&ccedil;on

qui est retir&eacute;e de l'exp&eacute;rience non-africaine, repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e

dans le pr&eacute;sent Bulletin par le rapport de Stronck sur

l'exp&eacute;rience du Luxembourg, en sa qualit&eacute; de membre

de divers organismes r&eacute;gionaux europ&eacute;ens.

<P>

Mais par-del&agrave; leur importance pour le d&eacute;bat sur

la coop&eacute;ration et l'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales

dont les articles parlent d'eux-m&ecirc;mes, ces articles soul&egrave;vent

&eacute;galement des th&egrave;mes plus larges relatifs au contenu

et &agrave; la m&eacute;thodologie de la gestion des politiques

de d&eacute;veloppement en tant que sujet d'&eacute;tude. Deux

th&egrave;mes pr&eacute;sentent une importance toute particuli&egrave;re

dans ce cadre.

<P>

Le premier point, fortement d&eacute;velopp&eacute; par Senghor,

est que le d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel en tant que partie

de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement doit &ecirc;tre

consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un 'processus'. Il faut reconna&icirc;tre

que les gouvernements ne disposent que d'une capacit&eacute; politique

limit&eacute;e dans une p&eacute;riode de temps donn&eacute;e

pour aborder les probl&egrave;mes politiques majeurs, que les

structures et les processus administratifs ne pourront &ecirc;tre

modifi&eacute;s que progressivement au fil du temps, et que la

soci&eacute;t&eacute; de mani&egrave;re plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale

n'a qu'une capacit&eacute; ou une volont&eacute; limit&eacute;e

de s'adapter aux changements de l'environnement politique et institutionnel

au sein duquel vivent et fonctionnent les entreprises, les exploitants

agricoles, les travailleurs, les consommateurs, et d'autres op&eacute;rateurs.

Ainsi, puisque tout ne peut se faire imm&eacute;diatement, le

probl&egrave;me politique crucial est de r&eacute;partir les actions

en 's&eacute;quences'.

<P>

A l'importance accord&eacute;e &agrave; la r&eacute;partition

s&eacute;quentielle dans l'&eacute;tude du d&eacute;veloppement

institutionnel correspondent les faits survenus dans l'&eacute;tude

de la r&eacute;forme des politiques &eacute;conomiques. L'attention

se porte d&eacute;sormais moins sur les objectifs et le contenu

des programmes de r&eacute;forme. Il n'est plus beaucoup de doute

sur l'importance des macro-politiques financi&egrave;res disciplin&eacute;es,

des march&eacute;s et des prix d'un secteur priv&eacute; actif

et d'un secteur public plus efficace, de programmes destin&eacute;s

&agrave; aider les pauvres et &agrave; d&eacute;velopper les ressources

humaines. Aujourd'hui, nous sommes tous devenus des ajusteurs

structurels!

<P>

Au lieu de cela, les sp&eacute;cialistes et les d&eacute;cideurs

politiques mettent l'accent sur la rapidit&eacute; et la r&eacute;partition

s&eacute;quentielle des mesures de r&eacute;forme. Les fonds pour

les services de ressources humaines peuvent-ils &ecirc;tre modifi&eacute;s

avant que les consolidations de production de l'&eacute;conomie

n'aient &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;form&eacute;es et stimul&eacute;es?

Les entreprises publiques non rentables doivent-elles &ecirc;tre

liquid&eacute;es ou vendues avant que n'aient &eacute;t&eacute;

mises en place les conditions requises pour &eacute;tablir les

entreprises du secteur priv&eacute;? Il convient d'y ajouter toute

une s&eacute;rie de questions sur la r&eacute;partition s&eacute;quentielle.

<P>

L'article de Senghor appelle la question de savoir si le sujet

de l'administration publique a engendr&eacute; un quelconque cadre

conceptuel comparable sur lequel fonder le th&egrave;me en &eacute;mergence

de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement. Ou alors

la tendance a-t-elle &eacute;t&eacute; de se concentrer sur les

structures institutionnelles et les processus administratifs 'id&eacute;aux'

ou 'optimaux', aux d&eacute;pens du processus permettant d'atteindre

ces objectifs?

<P>

Le deuxi&egrave;me th&egrave;me conceptuel pr&eacute;sentant de

l'importance pour l'avancement de la gestion des politiques de

d&eacute;veloppement comme sujet &agrave; part enti&egrave;re

au sein des sciences sociales est le besoin de retirer des hypoth&egrave;ses

provisoires des &eacute;tudes historiques et descriptives et de

tester &agrave; leur tour ces hypoth&egrave;ses par rapport &agrave;

d'autres &eacute;tudes d'exp&eacute;rience. Par exemple:

<P>

Aucun changement des dispositions institutionnelles ne pourra

faire avancer la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale de mani&egrave;re

efficace sans la participation de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile.

<P>

Dans l'envahissante situation africaine de gestion de crise de

la politique &eacute;conomique, aucune modification institutionnelle

ou politique ne permettra d'atteindre les objectifs &agrave; plus

long terme de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale si les bailleurs

de fonds ne se montrent pas d&eacute;cid&eacute;s &agrave; supporter

les frais &agrave; court terme et &agrave; compl&eacute;ter les

capacit&eacute;s administratives locales.

<P>

Aucun ajout majeur et important au niveau qualitatif apport&eacute;

aux objectifs gouverne- mentaux (par exemple coop&eacute;ration

r&eacute;gionale, objectifs relatifs &agrave; l'environnement,

r&ocirc;le des femmes) ne pourra &ecirc;tre imm&eacute;diatement

int&eacute;gr&eacute; dans la bureaucratie existante de prise

de d&eacute;cision et de mise en oeuvre des politiques; il faudra

au contraire une annexe s&eacute;par&eacute;e et bien &eacute;tablie

&agrave; cette bureaucratie.

<P>

Ces hypoth&egrave;ses et questions ou d'autres similaires devraient

peut-&ecirc;tre faire l'objet d'autres articles qui suivraient

une trame diff&eacute;rente. Il faut cependant ajouter en toute

franchise que, &agrave; moins que l'exp&eacute;rience des sp&eacute;cialistes

et des praticiens ne puisse &ecirc;tre mise &agrave; profit pour

tester ces hypoth&egrave;ses et en soulever de nouvelles, le sujet

en &eacute;mergence de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement

risque de ne pas acqu&eacute;rir de cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;

en tant que discipline scientifique. Nul besoin que le sujet devienne

prescriptif -- et certainement pas arrogamment prescriptif comme

cela est trop souvent vrai de l'&eacute;conomie. Mais il ne peut

cependant plus se contenter de d&eacute;crire et de traiter chaque

cas comme un probl&egrave;me unique.<HR>

<H3>Dimensions culturelles de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement:

&eacute;ditorial <BR>

</H3>



<P>

par <I>Stanley Please</I>

<P>

Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,

2(2) ao&ucirc;t 1994: pages 2 - 3 </CENTER></I><HR>



<P>

Dans un article r&eacute;cent, <I>l'Economist </I>affirmait que

&quot;les civilisations en plein essor se plaisent &agrave; expliquer

leur r&eacute;ussite &eacute;conomique non pas par quelque changement

laborieux des avantages comparatifs ou par l'&eacute;volution

technologique, mais bien par le fait qu'elles ont mis en exergue

des vertus uniques &agrave; leur culture. Vu les succ&egrave;s

&eacute;conomiques cons&eacute;cutives des pays de l'Asie orientale

au cours des deux derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, qui sont

susceptibles &agrave; se reproduire pendant la prochaine d&eacute;cennie,

l'article continue par affirmer que &quot;quelques Asiatiques

ont commenc&eacute; &agrave; proclamer la sup&eacute;riorit&eacute;

des valeurs asiatiques sur celles de l'Occident.&quot;

<P>

Mais quelle est vraiment l'importance des valeurs culturelles

dans l'&eacute;valuation de l'efficacit&eacute; de la gestion

des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement?

<P>

Tous ceux qui ont collabor&eacute; &agrave; la r&eacute;daction

du pr&eacute;sent Bulletin estiment que ces valeurs sont effectivement

importantes. L'un d'entre eux, Daniel Etounga-Manguelle, en est

convaincu qu'elles sont au coeur m&ecirc;me de l'&eacute;chec

de l'Afrique &agrave; d&eacute;velopper des institutions, tant

au micro-niveau qu'au macro-niveau, contribuant &agrave; la croissance

&eacute;conomique et &agrave; l'all&eacute;gement de la pauvret&eacute;.

<P>

Cette unanimit&eacute; r&eacute;side en partie dans le concept

et la d&eacute;finition de culture adopt&eacute;s par les collaborateurs.

Cette d&eacute;finition est bien plus qu'une simple r&eacute;f&eacute;rence

&agrave; la cr&eacute;ativit&eacute; artistique, litt&eacute;raire

et architecturale, &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation, etc.

<P>

Qu'est-ce que ce terme devra r&eacute;ellement inclure? Thierry

Verhelst soutient que la d&eacute;finition devrait, en effet,

tout englober, mais il d&eacute;conseille l'adoption d'une attitude

trop extr&ecirc;me. Cet avertissement vient du fait qu'il consid&egrave;re

la culture en termes dynamiques, c'est-&agrave;-dire que les communaut&eacute;s

adaptent leur h&eacute;ritage tant aux influences internes qu'aux

influences externes afin de relever les &quot;d&eacute;fis de

leur environnement naturel et social.&quot; Ce qui signifie que

la culture est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e par le comportement individuel

et social, en m&ecirc;me temps qu'elle le d&eacute;termine. 

<P>

Certains pensent que la faiblesse principale de la politique &eacute;conomique

africaine depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance provient moins de la culture

africaine que du pouvoir politique de ceux qui ont tout &agrave;

gagner de politiques d&eacute;form&eacute;es - les secteurs urbains

non agricoles, l'arm&eacute;e, les employ&eacute;s des entreprises

publiques inefficaces, et ceux qui tirent des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

des syst&egrave;mes de contr&ocirc;le et d'autorisation. Verhelst

leur r&eacute;pond que les rapports de forces dans la vie politique

sont eux-m&ecirc;mes le produit de la culture de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.

<P>

Mais alors que l'&eacute;tude de la culture en tant que ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne

dynamique pourrait, dans un certain sens, expliquer pleinement

la r&eacute;ussite ou l'&eacute;chec d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute;

&agrave; d&eacute;velopper des capacit&eacute;s efficaces pour

la gestion des politiques &eacute;conomiques, elle semble, dans

un autre sens, rester tr&egrave;s vague sur bien des points. Cependant,

Verhelst ne donne aucune indication sur la mani&egrave;re dont

les caract&eacute;ristiques culturelles devraient ou pourraient

&ecirc;tre modifi&eacute;es pour renforcer les capacit&eacute;s

de gestion.

<P>

Etounga-Manguelle s'attaque de plein front &agrave; cette lacune.

Il est persuad&eacute; que l'Afrique est 'l'enfant malade' du

monde en voie de d&eacute;veloppement parce qu'elle n'a pas su

reconna&icirc;tre la faiblesse de certaines pratiques et attitudes

inh&eacute;rentes &agrave; son h&eacute;ritage culturel. Il pense

que ce sont ces pratiques et attitudes qui sont &quot;au coeur

m&ecirc;me des faiblesses institutionnelles des organismes africains.&quot;

Elles sont des &quot;normes et valeurs fossilis&eacute;es&quot;

qui emprisonnent l'Afrique dans un dilemme &eacute;conomique.

Tout en acceptant la d&eacute;finition et le concept de culture

formul&eacute;s par Verhelst, il souligne la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

d'utiliser la culture comme instrument pour am&eacute;liorer les

capacit&eacute;s de gestion &eacute;conomique tant au micro-niveau

qu'au macro-niveau.

<P>

Rejetant les changements dict&eacute;s par l'ext&eacute;rieur,

qu'il juge non-durables, comme par exemple les &quot;programmes

d'ajustement structurel&quot; impos&eacute;s par les institutions

de Bretton Woods, il affirme le besoin d'&eacute;laborer de mani&egrave;re

interne des &quot;programmes d'ajustement culturel.&quot; Une

fois encore, tout comme Verhelst, il soutient que les programmes

doivent s'enraciner au plus profond dans l'histoire culturelle

de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Mais il faut &eacute;galement faire

preuve d'une plus grande volont&eacute; de rejeter ou de modifier

les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de l'histoire qui font obstacle au

d&eacute;veloppe- ment africain.

<P>

Etounga-Manguelle n'est pas seulement un homme de paroles, c'est

aussi un homme d'action. Il rend compte des programmes d&eacute;j&agrave;

mis en route par son organisation pan-africaine SADEG pour contribuer

&agrave; 'l'ajustement culturel' exig&eacute; des Africains et

des managers africains pour am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute;

de leurs organisations. Il pense que l'exp&eacute;rience acquise

d&eacute;montre d&eacute;j&agrave; que l'ajustement culturel est

non seulement n&eacute;cessaire, mais encore parfaitement possible

en Afrique. 

<P>

Julius Jeppe est tout aussi convaincu que le changement de r&eacute;gime

politique aura de tr&egrave;s fortes r&eacute;percussions sur

les institutions et processus de gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement

en Afrique du Sud. Ces derniers en viendront en effet &agrave;

refl&eacute;ter la nouvelle dominance de la culture afrocentrique

avec ses propres caract&eacute;ristiques bien distinctes de la

culture eurocentrique qui avait pr&eacute;domin&eacute; par le

pass&eacute;.

<P>

Il voit d&eacute;j&agrave; des signes pr&eacute;curseurs de ce

changement dans le processus par lequel la politique de reconstruction

et de d&eacute;veloppe- ment de l'ANC a &eacute;t&eacute; formul&eacute;e,

ainsi que dans son contenu, et aussi dans un grand nombre de dispositions

pr&eacute;vues par la nouvelle constitution sud-africaine. Les

deux documents soulignent l'importance du r&ocirc;le des communaut&eacute;s

et des structures traditionnelles du pouvoir et des processus

politiques. Ils mettent l'accent sur l'&eacute;tablissement d'un

consensus et rejettent l'esprit de conflit et de concurrence qui

caract&eacute;rise les cultures occidentales.

<P>

Jeppe ne s'interroge pas sur l'impact de ces changements pour

la qualit&eacute; future de la gestion des politiques de gestion

en Afrique du Sud. Il en est toutefois convaincu qu'ils affecteront

surtout des domaines tels que le syst&egrave;me foncier, le d&eacute;veloppement

d'une classe et culture entreprenantes, ainsi que d'autres &eacute;l&eacute;ments

essentiels pour la d&eacute;termination d'une politique &eacute;conomique,

et par cons&eacute;quent des performances &eacute;conomiques.

<P>

L'expression 'dimensions culturelles de la gestion des politiques

de d&eacute;veloppement' fait penser quasi automatiquement aux

probl&egrave;mes tels qu'ils surviennent dans les pays en voie

de d&eacute;veloppement. Marinette Oomen souligne l'erreur de

cette &eacute;troitesse de vue. L'erreur est particuli&egrave;rement

importante pour les pays qui d&eacute;pendent fortement des flux

d'aide et d'assistance technique externes - de toute &eacute;vidence

les pays africains.

<P>

Pour ces pays, les caract&eacute;ristiques culturelles des pays

donateurs doivent &ecirc;tre incorpor&eacute;es dans le concept.

Dans la pratique, la relation d'aide n'est pas une association

entre partenaires &eacute;gaux. Tant le concept que le style de

relation sont domin&eacute;s par le donateur.

<P>

De mani&egrave;re plus significative toutefois, Oomen attire l'attention

sur le th&egrave;me plus restreint mais non moins important de

la culture qui s'est d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e dans la communaut&eacute;

d'aide - au sein des agences d'aide et des ONG, ainsi que dans

les agences des pays donateurs et b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.

Son analyse et ses r&eacute;flexions se basent notamment sur l'&eacute;tude

de cas portant sur les projets d'aide n&eacute;erlandais au Mali.

<P>

Son article d&eacute;range, car il sugg&egrave;re l'existence

&quot;d'ordres du jour cach&eacute;s&quot;; l'auteur traduit son

inqui&eacute;tude &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des documents r&eacute;dig&eacute;s

par les N&eacute;erlandais et en n&eacute;erlandais, &agrave;

tous les niveaux du cycle de projet, et des documents cens&eacute;s

d&eacute;finir les objectifs du projet, ses r&eacute;sultats et

les groupes-cibles, mais qui semblent plus destin&eacute;s &agrave;

d&eacute;router qu'&agrave; &eacute;clairer.

<P>

Tout en gardant une attitude positive, elle pense que tout ce

qui se raconte au sujet des projets durables et de 'l'appropriation'

des programmes et projets par les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires

ne restera que vaines paroles si les faiblesses de la culture

de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement ne sont pas modifi&eacute;es

conform&eacute;ment aux suggestions faites dans son &eacute;tude

de cas.

<P>

A quoi nous am&egrave;ne alors cette discussion provocatrice sur

les dimensions culturelles de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement?

Les &eacute;conomistes du d&eacute;veloppement devraient- ils

&ecirc;tre mis &agrave; la retraite et remplac&eacute;s au sein

des gouvernements et des agences d'aide par des &eacute;tudiants

en culture - selon toute vraisemblance des sociologues, des avocats,

des anthropologues, des experts en politicologie et des historiens?

<P>

Certes, les &eacute;conomistes ont tendance &agrave; voir les

gens du monde entier plus comme des personnes semblables que comme

des &ecirc;tres diff&eacute;rents, r&eacute;agissant de mani&egrave;re

similaire, que ce soit en tant qu'individus ou en tant que groupes,

aux occasions du march&eacute; et &agrave; des stimulants en termes

de ce qu'ils produisent et de ce qu'ils ach&egrave;tent. Bien

entendu 'similarit&eacute;' des r&eacute;ponses ne signifie pas

'identit&eacute;' des r&eacute;ponses. Il y a encore de la place

pour que les caract&eacute;ristiques et institutions culturelles

des peuples jouent leur r&ocirc;le. Mais lorsque l'on parle d'&eacute;laboration

de politiques, les &eacute;conomistes pensent - &agrave; tort

ou &agrave; raison - qu'ils se concentrent sur les variables les

plus cruciales et universelles qui d&eacute;terminent le comportement

&eacute;conomique des individus, des groupes et des pays.

<P>

De plus, malgr&eacute; l'importance particuli&egrave;re accord&eacute;e

par les auteurs &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de dynamiser

les caract&eacute;ristiques culturelles d'un pays afin d'&eacute;viter

la stagnation et m&ecirc;me le d&eacute;clin &eacute;conomique,

les &eacute;conomistes se pr&eacute;occupent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement

du fait que les changements 'sensibles' de politiques et de programmes

visant &agrave; g&eacute;n&eacute;rer la croissance &eacute;conomique

et r&eacute;duire la pauvret&eacute; puissent &ecirc;tre rejet&eacute;s

pour cause d'incompatibilit&eacute; avec la culture d'un pays.

Comme d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;voqu&eacute;, ce danger est particuli&egrave;rement

inqui&eacute;tant l&agrave; o&ugrave; la d&eacute;finition de

la culture englobe les groupes d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts politiques

puissants qui se sont constitu&eacute;s autour de politiques d&eacute;form&eacute;es.

<P>

Mais ce sont l&agrave; des questions qui ressortent des r&eacute;flexions

sur les articles parus dans le Bulletin relativement &agrave;

la gestion des politiques au niveau macro. Au niveau micro, l'importance

de concevoir des projets et des programmes en accordant un r&ocirc;le

majeur aux facteurs politiques pertinents est ind&eacute;niable.

Il n'est plus possible d'ignorer, &eacute;tant trop longue, la

litanie des projets rat&eacute;s (par exemple le 'Rapport Wapenhans'

sur les projets de la Banque mondiale) qui doivent souvent leur

&eacute;chec &agrave; l'incapacit&eacute; de discerner les caract&eacute;ristiques

culturelles locales.

<P>

Toutefois, m&ecirc;me au niveau micro, des r&eacute;serves peuvent

&ecirc;tre &eacute;mises quant &agrave; un attachement trop important

&agrave; l'opinion selon laquelle le d&eacute;veloppement doit

s'enraciner dans la culture des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s. Le d&eacute;veloppement

&eacute;conomique implique obligatoirement le changement du comportement

des individus et des groupes. 

<P>

Avec tout le respect pour les efforts et l'optimisme d'Etounga-Manguelle,

il faut au moins reconna&icirc;tre que, historiquement, le dynamisme

n&eacute;cessaire au d&eacute;veloppement provient souvent, si

pas toujours, de groupes non endog&egrave;nes, fr&eacute;quemment

mis au ban de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et qui n'ont pas leurs

'racines' dans le pays, comme par exemple les juifs en Europe,

les quakers et autres non- conformistes en Grande-Bretagne, les

Chinois dans de nombreux pays d'Asie de l'Est, les Libanais et

les Asiatiques dans divers pays d'Afrique. Aux Etats-Unis, personne

n'a de 'racines' dans une soci&eacute;t&eacute; traditionnelle,

&agrave; l'exception de ceux qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; parqu&eacute;s

de force dans des r&eacute;serves et interdits de toute participation

au processus de d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique.

<P>

Verhelst et consorts peuvent bien insister sur le fait &quot;qu'il

ne peut y avoir de d&eacute;veloppement sans racines&quot;, mais

l'argument selon lequel &quot;il ne peut y avoir de d&eacute;veloppement

si les racines sont trop fortes et trop inflexibles&quot; est

tout aussi valable - une proposition que ne d&eacute;sapprouverait,

je pense, aucun des collaborateurs, y compris Verhelst et Etounga-Manguelle.

Partenariat et coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement: Editorial</h3>

par <i>Stanley Please</i>

<p>

Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN, 2(3) d&#233;cembre 1994:

pages 2 - 3</i>

</center>

<hr>

<p>

Il est g&#233;n&#233;ralement accept&#233; que l'aide financi&#232;re et technique fournie

par le donateur ne r&#233;ussit &#224; promouvoir le d&#233;veloppement

&#233;conomique et social que si les pays b&#233;n&#233;fi- ciaires 's'approprient' les

projets, les programmes et les politiques soutenus par le donateur. N&#233;anmoins, dans les

pays sub-sahariens, l'action combin&#233;e de flux massifs d'aide et, dans certains cas, d'une

situation &#233;conomique d&#233;sastreuse a conduit &#224; une demande tout aussi

g&#233;n&#233;rale &#224; l'int&#233;rieur des pays donateurs pour que des comptes soient

rendus aux respon- sables politiques et aux &#233;lecteurs sur l'aide fournie. Cette demande

s'exprime m&ecirc;me s'il est reconnu que cela entra&icirc;nerait presque

in&#233;vitablement une plus grande ing&#233;rence du donateur dans les pays

b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires et, donc, un sentiment affaibli 'd'appropriation.'

<p>

Ce dilemme et le danger que l'efficacit&#233; de l'aide ne soit entra&icirc;n&#233;e

dans un mouvement n&#233;faste de spirale vers le bas, ont incit&#233; l'ECDPM

&#224; consacrer sa Table ronde de 1994 &#224; 'Partenariat et coop&#233;ration

au d&#233;veloppement: associer la responsabilit&#233; des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires

au besoin des donateurs de justifier l'utilisation de l'aide.' Un rapport contient le discours

d'introduction de Louk Box, directeur de l'ECDPM, ainsi que les discours de Simba

Makoni, ancien secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral de la Communaut&#233; de

d&#233;veloppement pour l'Afrique australe et de Jan Cedergren, directeur adjoint de

l'Agence su&#233;doise de d&#233;veloppement international (SIDA).

<p>

Ce num&#233;ro du Bulletin reproduit des articles qui ont &#233;t&#233;

pr&#233;sent&#233;s par quelques autres participants de la Table ronde. Ils ont

&#233;t&#233; choisis de mani&#232;re &#224; fournir une diversit&#233; de

points de vue sur la question du partenariat dans la coop&#233;ration au

d&#233;veloppement. Les articles choisis se rapportent sp&#233;cifiquement au

d&#233;fi que Louk Box a pr&#233;sent&#233; dans son discours, &#224; savoir "se

concentrer sur la mani&#232;re pratique d'am&#233;liorer le partenariat en tenant

compte des contraintes r&#233;elles de la vie;" et "fournir une indication pratique sur

la mani&#232;re de l'am&#233;liorer." Il exposa &#233;galement trois conditions

n&#233;cessaires pour r&#233;pondre &#224; ce d&#233;fi: premi&#232;rement,

un sujet ne devrait faire l'objet "d' aucun tabou;" deuxi&#232;mement, les participants

devraient se "garder de toute attitude d&#233;fensive;" et troisi&#232;mement, les

participants devraient se concentrer sur "des approches de gestion, pratiques et faisables."

<p>

Dans son article, Fonseca a su faire sien l'esprit de la Table ronde. Il attribue en effet

l'&#233;chec du partenariat &#224; la faiblesse des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires

combin&#233;e &#224; l'arrogance des donateurs. Toutefois, il souligne que les

faiblesses qu'il a &#224; l'esprit ne sont pas simplement les faiblesses &#233;conomiques

et technologiques, ni m&ecirc;me leurs faiblesses institutionnelles bien que celles-ci soient

importantes. Les faiblesses morales des dirigeants des pays africains le pr&#233;occupent

davantage; de m&ecirc;me que l'arrogance des donateurs qui "sont persuad&#233;s

qu'eux seuls d&#233;tiennent les bonnes id&#233;es." Une plus grande modestie et

davantage de bonne volont&#233; de la part des donateurs pour partager la

responsabilit&#233; des erreurs commises est essentielle, d'apr&#232;s lui, pour

am&#233;liorer la relation de partenariat.

<p>

Cette analyse franche du probl&#232;me que propose Fonseca donne le ton de

l'ensemble de la discussion de la Table ronde. Son article est suivi d'une s&#233;lection

de citations extraites des d&#233;bats, qui en rendent l'esprit.

<p>

Le commentaire m&#233;thodologique de Pinto consiste en un guide utile pour aller au-

del&#224; de la simple r&#233;p&#233;tition de mots &#224; la mode, tels

qu'engagement ou appropriation, et arriver &#224; quelque chose de pratique. Il

souligne que 'l'engagement' est simplement associ&#233; &#224; "l'intention des

dirigeants" tandis que 'l'appropriation' se rapporte aux "acteurs qui d&#233;termineront

la mise en oeuvre." Il conclut en disant: "vous pouvez vous engager sans pour cela

&ecirc;tre un propri&#233;taire responsable, mais vous ne pouvez pas &ecirc;tre un

propri&#233;taire responsable sans vous engager." Il pr&#233;sente une description de

l'Evaluation institutionnelle de l'environnement (IEA), une proc&#233;dure qui permet

d'&#233;valuer et d'am&#233;liorer l'appropriation. Son succ&#232;s d&#233;pend

de la bonne volont&#233; des gouvernements &#224; prendre en charge les co&ucirc;ts

suppl&#233;mentaires qu'elle comporte, et de celle des donateurs &#224; rectifier leurs

propres proc&#233;dures internes.

<p>

La diff&#233;rence de r&ocirc;les au sein du processus politique entre les dirigeants

politiques et les technocrates est &#233;galement soulign&#233;e par Brinkerhoff. Il est

inquiet de voir que les technocrates traitent l'&#233;laboration de politiques comme un

"processus lin&#233;aire" et mettent l'accent sur le principe selon lequel "les

premi&#232;res ordonnances sont les meilleures" au lieu de reconna&icirc;tre qu'il s'agit

d'un "processus politique et interactif" dans lequel "le consensus se construit autour de

solutions qui sont des deuxi&#232;mes ou des troisi&#232;mes choix." A partir de cette

analyse, il d&#233;crit les grandes lignes d'une proc&#233;dure appel&#233;e Mise

en oeuvre d'un changement politique (IPC) que l'USAID a d&#233;velopp&#233;e.

Comme pour la proc&#233;dure de l'IEA de Pinto, l'IPC est con&#231;u pour assurer

&#224; la fois un engagement national et une appropriation des politiques et des pro-

grammes, ainsi que pour d&#233;velopper une relation de partenariat avec les donateurs.

Il illustre l'utilisation de l'IPC en se r&#233;f&#233;rant &#224; l'application qui en

a &#233;t&#233; faite en Zambie.<p>

Dans son discours, Louk Box avait affirm&#233; que les probl&#232;mes

abord&#233;s &#224; la Table ronde s'adressaient tout autant aux ONG qu'aux

bailleurs de fonds. Goyder d'Actionaid l'admet &#233;galement dans son article. Dans

celui-ci, il souligne que, tandis que le partenariat continue &#224; &ecirc;tre la

philosophie ma&icirc;tresse des ONG, "la plupart des ONG sont confront&#233;es

&#224; de r&#233;elles difficult&#233;s pour rendre ce concept tout &#224; fait

op&#233;rationnel." Les pressions nationales qui s'exercent pour rendre plus de comptes

et pour introduire de nouveaux sujets de pr&#233;occupa- tion, tels que

l'environnement, la condition des femmes, etc., "font qu'il est difficile de rendre des

comptes aux communaut&#233;s avec lesquelles nous travaillons." Goyder

pr&#233;sente alors l'exp&#233;rience d'Actionaid face &#224; ce probl&#232;me:

ne pas se pr&#233;cipiter dans le financement de projets mais plut&ocirc;t laisser ces

projets na&icirc;tre de l'action des communaut&#233;s; engager un personnel local qui

vivra et travaillera l&#224; o&ugrave; se d&#233;veloppera le projet; travailler en

collaboration avec le gouvernement local et les communaut&#233;s plut&ocirc;t qu'avec

les gouvernements nationaux; ne pas surcharger le personnel sur le terrain avec des

exigences trop lourdes quant &#224; l'obligation de rendre des rapports. Il tire de cette

exp&#233;rience des le&#231;ons pour les agences d'aide.<p>

Certains participants &#233;taient nettement moins optimistes quant aux chances de

r&#233;forme de la relation d'aide dans le sens d'un partenariat am&#233;lior&#233;.

Pour eux, il faut &ecirc;tre moins id&#233;aliste et plus pragmatique; reconna&icirc;tre

que les "forces en faveur de l'inertie &#224; l'int&#233;rieur de syst&#232;mes

bureaucratiques en place depuis longtemps" sont fortes et envahissantes. Cette citation

vient de l'article de Tabor qui tirait des le&#231;ons de l'engagement de donateurs dans

la recherche agricole. Malgr&#233; les "besoins largement inchang&#233;s de nouvelles

technologies pour r&#233;pondre au probl&#232;me de la pauvret&#233; rurale et

des demandes du pays en nourriture," l'engagement du donateur manque d'envergure,

privil&#233;gie des &#233;quipements difficiles &#224; maintenir, et est soumis

&#224; des changements politiques inutiles de la part du donateur. Tabor d&#233;fend

une approche moins ambitieuse pour les ann&#233;es 90. Il s'agirait d'une approche

o&ugrave; les arrangements de partenariat seraient n&#233;goci&#233;s lorsque l'on

"peut concilier les besoins du b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire et les instruments d'aide du

donateur." Toute autre relation de partenariat &#224; plus long terme "serait plus le

produit d'un heureux hasard que celui d'une politique d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;e."

<p>

Il ressort clairement de ces articles que les participants ont &#224; la fois reconnu

l'importance du dilemme appropriation et obligation de rendre des comptes pos&#233;

par la Table ronde et qu'ils ont pris au s&#233;rieux la demande de Louk Box de se

concentrer sur les conclusions prati- ques que leurs exp&#233;riences ont mises &#224;

jour. Bien s&ucirc;r les discussions revenaient sans cesse sur la difficult&#233; de

cr&#233;er quelque chose se rap- prochant d'une relation entre partenaires &#233;g-

aux, lorsque le pouvoir &#233;conomique, technolo- gique, professionnel, institutionnel

et politique des donneurs et des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires est si in&#233;gal. 

La SIDA est clairement l'un des quelques donateurs d&#233;sireux et politiquement

capables de reconna&icirc;tre de fa&#231;on explicite cette in&#233;galit&#233; et

de l'affronter. A travers sa politique de 'Renouvellement des r&ocirc;les,' la SIDA essaye

d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment de fa&#231;onner sa relation strat&#233;gique et

op&#233;rationnelle avec les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires de son assistance d'une

mani&#232;re qui permette de pr&#233;venir, ou au moins de diminuer, les effets

nocifs de cette in&#233;galit&#233; sur l'appropriation des projets et des programmes

chez les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Elle reconna&icirc;t que c'est risqu&#233;, mais la

SIDA affirme qu'&#224; moins d'une appropriation r&#233;elle du

b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire, les risques d'&#233;checs sont encore plus importants. 

<p>

Si cette strat&#233;gie donne tout son sens &#224; des relations de partenariat entre

des pays o&ugrave; tant le donneur que le b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire placent la politique

de d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et social en t&ecirc;te de leurs

priorit&#233;s politiques, peut-on dire toutefois que cette strat&#233;gie est aussi

efficace pour tous les autres pays, donateurs et b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, o&ugrave;

cette situation - malheureusement - ne se retrouve pas? La Table ronde ne se concentrait

pas sur cette diff&#233;rence entre pays.

<p>

Mais le plus pr&#233;occupant, c'est que du c&ocirc;t&#233; des donateurs, les

proc&#233;dures ne varient pas selon qu'il s'agit de pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires

&#224; 'bonne' performance ou &#224; 'mauvaise' performance. Si ce concept de

partenariat devait se d&#233;velopper, il faudrait de la part des donateurs une

volont&#233; plus forte de s'orienter vers la strat&#233;gie pr&ocirc;n&#233;e par

la SIDA dans leurs relations avec ces pays qui luttent s&#233;rieusement contre des

probl&#232;mes &#233;conomiques et sociaux graves. Ces pays devraient instaurer un

climat de confiance tel que leur gouvernement puisse r&#233;ellement s'approprier ces

politiques.<p>

Il est ind&#233;niable que certaines conditions tr&#232;s strictes sont tout &#224; fait

ind&#233;sirables et contre-productives; &#224; titre d'exemple, celles qui sont

attach&#233;es aux pr&ecirc;ts d'ajustement structurel de la Banque mondiale et dont

les implications sur la politique &#233;conomique int&#233;rieure seraient

dict&#233;es par Washington.

<p>

Cependant une telle fermet&#233; pourrait &ecirc;tre souhaitable pour d'autres pays

b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, au moins pour une p&#233;riode limit&#233;e. Cela serait

particuli&#232;rement le cas l&#224; o&ugrave;, apr&#232;s une p&#233;riode de

d&#233;sastre &#233;conomique ou politique, la confiance devrait rena&icirc;tre entre

les donneurs et les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Une fois cette confiance r&#233;tablie,

il serait possible et souhaitable d'acc&#233;l&#233;rer le mouvement vers un

partenariat.

<p>

Une derni&#232;re r&#233;flexion sur cette Table ronde nous fait revenir au discours

de Makoni: "Un partenariat vrai et sinc&#232;re," concluait Makoni, "ne sera pas le

r&#233;sultat, ni en tout ni en partie, de bonnes institutions et de bonnes

proc&#233;dures, mais il na&icirc;tra plut&ocirc;t d'une communaut&#233; claire

d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t, d'une volont&#233; et d'un engagement politiques forts, de

l'honn&ecirc;tet&#233; et de la sinc&#233;rit&#233;." De leur c&ocirc;t&#233;, les

donateurs ne peuvent pas simplement "bl&#226;mer l'incomp&#233;tence ou la

corruption des gouvernements des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires" et ces

gouvernements, quant &#224; eux, "doivent prendre leur destin en mains afin de

d&#233;terminer l'aide dont ils ont besoin et afin de pouvoir dire 'non' &#224; l'aide

dont ils n'ont pas besoin."

<p>

Le pr&#233;sident de la Table ronde, Louk Box, demanda qu'aucun tabou, qu'aucune

attitude d&#233;fensive ne vienne limiter les d&#233;bats. Le discours que Makoni

pr&#233;senta au participants r&#233;pondait sans nul doute &#224; ce voeu.

R&#233;forme de la fonction publique: Editorial</h3>

par <i>Stanley Please</i>

<p>

Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN</i>, 3(1) ao&#251;t 1995: pages 2 - 3

</center>

<hr>

<p>

"Dans de nombreux pays de l'Afrique sub-saharienne, l'inefficacit&#233; du service public

risque de miner presque tous les efforts de d&#233;veloppement, ainsi que l'administration

publique de base." Cette citation de Mamadou Dia refl&#232;te la pr&#233;occupation qui

est &#224; la base de toutes les articles de cette &#233;dition du Bulletin.

<p>

Mais cette pr&#233;occupation ne se limite pas &#224; l'Afrique. C'est ce que souligne Kaul dans son

&#233;tude sur les exp&#233;riences men&#233;es r&#233;cemment sur le plan de la r&#233;forme du

service public dans les pays du Commonwealth, dont le Royaume-Uni, l'Australie, la Nouvelle-

Z&#233;lande, l'Inde, le Bangladesh, la Malaisie, Hongkong, Singapour, la Trinit&#233; et Tobago, le

Ghana et la Zambie. Diff&#233;rentes causes politiques et &#233;conomiques aux micro et macro-

niveaux ont &#233;t&#233; &#224; l'origine de ces r&#233;formes. Des changements d'opinions

essentiels se sont op&#233;r&#233;s en ce qui concerne une plus grande efficacit&#233; du r&ocirc;le

de l'Etat dans l'&#233;conomie. Au micro-niveau, on s'est interrog&#233; sur la mani&#232;re la plus

efficace de fournir aux services publics les possibilit&#233;s d'une commercialisation plus

d&#233;velopp&#233;e des d&#233;partements gouvernementaux et de travailler avec le secteur

priv&#233; et les ONG.

<p>

Cependant, ce sont les pays africains qui int&#233;ressent particuli&#232;rement les auteurs. En effet,

c'est en Afrique qu'un ensemble complexe de facteurs a conduit &#224; une situation telle que

pratiquement tous les pays ont des services publiques jug&#233;s d'un oeil critique pour,

premi&#232;rement &ecirc;tre trop importants en termes d'effectifs, deuxi&#232;mement pour

&ecirc;tre excessivement co&ucirc;teux en termes de d&#233;penses budg&#233;taires et

troisi&#232;mement pour &ecirc;tre inefficaces en termes de fourniture des services publics

demand&#233;s par les pays. Dans les ann&#233;es 80, et principalement sous l'influence

ext&#233;rieure du FMI et de la Banque mondiale, l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t se portait essentiellement sur

les deux premiers probl&#232;mes. L'objectif principal &#233;tait alors de ma&icirc;triser les co&ucirc;ts

m&ecirc;me si, comme le souligne Yahaya, le probl&#232;me de l'efficacit&#233; recevait tout de

m&ecirc;me une certaine attention.

<p>

Il est int&#233;ressant de noter que, contrairement aux ann&#233;es 80, tous les auteurs de ce Bulletin

passent quasi sous silence les probl&#232;mes d'embauches excessives dans le service public et de

co&ucirc;ts budg&#233;taires trop &#233;lev&#233;s. Ceci n'est certainement pas d&ucirc; au fait que

les actions entreprises dans les ann&#233;es 80 ont permet de r&#233;soudre efficacement ces

probl&#232;mes. Alors qu'une r&#233;duction en effet consid&#233;rable d'employ&#233;s s'est

op&#233;r&#233;e dans certains pays (par exemple, au Ghana, en R&#233;publique Centrafricaine, en

Guin&#233;e, en Mauritanie et en Ouganda), dans d'autres, le personnel a en r&#233;alit&#233;

augment&#233; (par exemple, en C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, au Malawi, au Niger et en Tanzanie). Par ailleurs,

aucune des r&#233;ductions significatives escompt&#233;es en mati&#232;re de co&ucirc;t

budg&#233;taire du service public n'a et&#233; constat&#233;e, m&ecirc;me l&#224; o&ugrave; les

effectifs ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;duits. 

<p>

Ces articles semblent refl&#233;ter le transfert d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t consid&#233;rable qui s'est

op&#233;r&#233; dans le d&#233;bat sur la r&#233;forme du service public dans les ann&#233;es 90 en

faveur du troisi&#232;me probl&#232;me, &#224; savoir celui de l'efficacit&#233;. Ceci ne rel&#232;ve

pas seulement du fait que la concentration exclusive sur les effectifs et le co&ucirc;t est aujourd'hui

consid&#233;r&#233;e comme ayant &#233;t&#233; trop restrictive. Ce qui est important, c'est que la

disponibilit&#233; d'un service public efficace offrant des prestations quantitatives et qualitatives est

d&#233;sormais consid&#233;r&#233;e comme une condition n&#233;cessaire pour g&#233;n&#233;rer

un d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et humain &#224; une cadence plus rapide. Comme le

souligne Corkery, "En dehors de l'importance de l'Etat dans la fourniture des services relatifs &#224;

la loi, l'ordre, la justice, la d&#233;fense, l'infrastructure, l'&#233;ducation et la sant&#233;", on admet

plus g&#233;n&#233;ralement et avec plus de fermet&#233; que dans les ann&#233;es 80 que "les

institutions du march&#233; libre ne peuvent fonctionner que si les institutions gouvernementales

fonctionnement elles aussi."

<p>

C'est dans ce contexte que Corkery et Fofana passent en revue les exp&#233;riences issues des

programmes de r&#233;forme du service public dans les pays anglophones et francophones. On

notera avec int&#233;r&ecirc;t que leurs conclusions sont &#224; peu pr&#232;s identiques quant aux

conditions prioritaires pour le succ&#232;s de la mise en pratique de ces programmes. Trois de ces

conclusions se dessinent: (i) garantir l'implication du gouvernement non seulement en paroles, mais

aussi en pratique par l'instauration de rouages institutionnels techniquement et politiquement

puissants permettant d'entreprendre des r&#233;formes; (ii) garantir l'implication des fonctionnaires

&#224; travers un m&#233;canisme r&#233;gulier gouvernement-syndicat et aussi par d'autres canaux;

(iii) garantir la participation de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile.

<p>

L'article de Rasheed, "Ethique et responsabilit&#233; dans le service public africain," souligne

&#233;galement l'importance de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans la r&#233;forme du service public. Son

article pr&#233;sente un rapport sens&#233; mais mordant sur l'importance cruciale de la

soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans la chasse &#224; "la corruption absolue, au patronage, au n&#233;potisme,

... au travail au noir, &#224; l'absent&#233;isme, &#224; l'abus des biens publics" qui sont devenus des

"pratiques tellement r&#233;pandues, devenant m&ecirc;me des normes institutionnelles de

comportement en Afrique, que l'on peut parler &#224; juste titre d'une crise de moralit&#233; dans

les services publics africains." Son analyse des causes profondes de cette crise le conduit &#224; des

conclusions qui se focalisent sur les probl&#232;mes de l'embauche, de la formation, notamment la

formation sur les valeurs professionnelles et sur le service public, et de l'&#233;tablissement et la mise

en place effective de codes de conduite. En outre, ses conclusions, comme celles de Fofana,

soulignent le besoin de "campagnes d'&#233;ducation des masses," "d'instauration de coalitions

d'associations professionnelles et autres organisations pour d&#233;voiler et combattre la corruption"

et, de mani&#232;re plus g&#233;n&#233;rale, pour mobiliser la soci&#233;t&#233; civile et pour

"encourager la participation du peuple afin de garantir la r&#233;activit&#233;, la responsabilit&#233;

et la transparence de la gouvernance." 

<p>

Rasheed reproche aussi aux pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s le r&ocirc;le actif et initiateur que jouent leurs

hommes d'affaires dans la corruption des hauts fonctionnaires en Afrique. En outre, il n'&#233;pargne

pas de ses critiques leurs gouvernements, dont il constate que beaucoup d'entre eux ferment les yeux

et m&ecirc;me donnent leur b&#233;n&#233;diction &#224; des pratiques de corruption dans

l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t des objectifs d'exportation (les pots- de-vin &#233;tant m&ecirc;me

d&#233;ductibles des imp&ocirc;ts pour certains). Il voit en Transparency International un bon

d&#233;but pour "tirer la sonnette d'alarme" sur l'ensemble de ces probl&#232;mes. Cependant, il

soutient tr&#232;s justement la mise en place de conventions internationales visant &#224; garantir

une meilleure transparence dans les transactions et &#224; punir ceux qui sont impliqu&#233;s dans

les pratiques de corruption. <p>

Yahaya se concentre enti&#232;rement sur le probl&#232;me de la formation, identifi&#233;e par les

autres auteurs comme un &#233;l&#233;ment important de la r&#233;forme du service public. Il fait

la distinction entre, d'une part, les pr&#233;c&#233;dentes tentatives de r&#233;forme en Afrique - qui

se focalisaient uniquement sur la formation de fonctionnaires en vue de fournir une "bureaucratie

rationnelle" weberienne - et, d'autre part, la nouvelle conception de r&#233;forme qui se concentre

sur le renforcement des capacit&#233;s de bonne gouvernance. Ce concept n'englobe pas seulement

le service public lui-m&ecirc;me, mais aussi sa relation avec le secteur priv&#233; et avec la

soci&#233;t&#233; civile en g&#233;n&#233;ral. Yahaya pr&#233;sente ensuite bri&#232;vement les

s&#233;minaires, les programmes de formation, et les autres activit&#233;s qui seront organis&#233;s

par les centres de formation &#224; l'analyse et &#224; la gestion des politiques et mis en place

conjointement par le secr&#233;tariat du Commonwealth, l'CEA et l'AAPAM dans six pays francophones,

anglophones et lusophones.

<p>

Ces articles font clairement appara&icirc;tre que les gouvernements africains sont maintenant tout

&#224; fait conscients de la n&#233;cessit&#233; de cr&#233;er des services publics plus efficaces et

profond&#233;ment motiv&#233;s sur lesquels ils peuvent compter pour formuler et appliquer des

politiques et des programmes et, de mani&#232;re plus g&#233;n&#233;rale, pour administrer

efficacement leurs pays. De plus, ces articles d&#233;montrent aussi que des programmes de

r&#233;forme refl&#233;tant cette prise de conscience ont d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233;

amorc&#233;s. 

La question est de savoir si ce sont les gouvernements eux-m&ecirc;mes qui signalent l'&#233;tat

d'urgence de cette situation, ou si ce sont les auteurs de ce Bulletin qui expriment en effet cette

urgence avec suffisamment de conviction. Il est &#233;vident qu'un juste &#233;quilibre doit &ecirc;tre

atteint &#224; cet &#233;gard. Comme le souligne notamment Corkery, les mesures de r&#233;forme

introduites avec trop de pr&#233;cipitation peuvent facilement &#233;chouer car elles courent le

danger d'&ecirc;tre &#224; la fois pr&#233;par&#233;es de mani&#232;re inad&#233;quate avec les

fonctionnaires et la soci&#233;t&#233; civile. Constituer des groupements puissants charg&#233;s des

r&#233;formes au sein des pays est un message porteur dont on ne peut nier l'importance. Il est

certain que les mesures de r&#233;forme impos&#233;es par les institutions de Bretton Woods, telles

qu'elles l'&#233;taient souvent dans les ann&#233;es 80, et qui "n'appartiennent" pas au pays, semblent

vou&#233;es &#224; l'&#233;chec.

<p>

Cependant, les distorsions qui ont surgi dans les &#233;conomies africaines sont si profondes qu'elles

ne pourraient &ecirc;tre r&#233;sorb&#233;es que par des r&#233;formes majeures soutenues pendant

plusieurs ann&#233;es et b&#233;n&#233;ficiant d'une aide ext&#233;rieure adapt&#233;e, en

g&#233;n&#233;rant ainsi des taux de croissance &#233;conomique qui se maintiendront au moins au

niveau des taux de croissance de la population de 3% ou plus. La distorsion principale r&#233;sulte de

la discrimination contre l'agriculture et l'industrie dans la fixation des prix, la fiscalit&#233;, le taux de

change et les autres politiques. Par cons&#233;quent, pour les jeunes sortant de l'&#233;cole, l'emploi

dans les services publics, l'&#233;ducation et les autres services repr&#233;sente le seul secteur

dynamique sur le march&#233; du travail. De plus, c'est dans ces services que les syndicats ont pris

tout leur essor, renfor&#231;ant les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts financiers de leurs employ&#233;s au

d&#233;triment de ceux des personnes travaillant dans l'agriculture et dans l'industrie. Cette

disparit&#233; dans les possibilit&#233;s de revenus n'a pas &#233;t&#233; constat&#233;e dans la

plupart des autres pays du monde en d&#233;veloppement. En Afrique elle a conduit, entre autres

probl&#232;mes, &#224; un probl&#232;me budg&#233;taire, &#224; savoir que 40% ou plus des

d&#233;penses gouvernementales &#233;taient consacr&#233;es aux salaires et appointements par

opposition &#224; pr&#232;s de 25% dans les autres pays en d&#233;veloppement. 

<p>

Une part de cette discrimination a pu &ecirc;tre r&#233;solue au cours des derni&#232;res ann&#233;es

par des mesures de r&#233;forme &#233;conomique souvent entreprises dans le cadre de programmes

d'ajustement structurel. Cependant, la situation critique des fonctionnaires, en particulier dans

certains anciens pays "sinistr&#233;s," comme l'Ouganda et le Mozambique, ne doit pas &ecirc;tre un

paravent &#224; la discrimination permanente en faveur du secteur public dans de nombreux autres

pays africains tant francophones qu' anglophones. Il reste encore beaucoup &#224; faire.

<p> 

Ces mesures de r&#233;forme &#233;conomique ont malheureusement elles-m&ecirc;mes

engendr&#233; un probl&#232;me au niveau de la r&#233;forme du service public, &#233;tant

donn&#233; qu'elles se sont sold&#233;es par des baisses et m&ecirc;me des taux inadapt&#233;s de

croissance &#233;conomique dans la plupart des pays africains. Par cons&#233;quent, pour les

fonctionnaires licenci&#233;s et les nouveaux arrivants sur le march&#233; du travail, ni l'agriculture,

ni l'industrie n'offrent de grandes possibilit&#233;s d'emploi.

<p>

Il reste maintenant &#224; esp&#233;rer que les pays soutiendront et acc&#233;l&#233;reront ces

programmes de r&#233;forme. Comme le soulignent de nombreux articles, la cr&#233;ation de

groupements de soutien est importante. Mais en fin de compte, une action disciplin&#233;e et

politiquement courageuse des gouvernements est in&#233;vitable. C'est le cas en particulier lorsque

des droits acquis dans des institutions favoris&#233;es et inefficaces ne r&#233;ussissent pas &#224;

offrir un soutien appropri&#233; permettant d'acc&#233;l&#233;rer l'introduction des mesures de

r&#233;forme.

<p>

Dans son article, Rasheed souligne le besoin "d'un agenda d&#233;taill&#233;" pour r&#233;former le

service public. On peut ajouter le fait que ces r&#233;formes ne seront accept&#233;es plus facilement

et appliqu&#233;es avec succ&#232;s que si elles s'assortissent de programmes macro-

&#233;conomiques qui g&#233;n&#232;rent une &#233;conomie plus dynamique. Ceci n'est pas du seul

ressort des gouvernements nationaux. Si le FMI et la Banque mondiale sont aussi impliqu&#233;s qu'ils

le pr&#233;tendent dans les programmes de r&#233;forme &#233;conomique pour r&#233;soudre les

distorsions dans les institutions et les politiques, notamment celles du service public, ils devraient

reconna&icirc;tre que ces programmes doivent &ecirc;tre assortis de politiques macro-

&#233;conomiques orient&#233;es vers la croissance. Une discipline macro-financi&#232;re est

essentielle &#224; la bonne sant&#233; des politiques &#233;conomiques. Cependant, ceci n'est pas

synonyme de restriction permanente.

<p>

Seule une &#233;conomie croissante permettra de rendre la r&#233;forme du service public plus

acceptable et de lui donner toute sa raison d'&ecirc;tre, &#224; savoir contribuer &#224; un taux plus

&#233;lev&#233; de croissance et de d&#233;veloppement des ressources humaines en Afrique.

<p>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<p>

A leur ind&#233;pendance, les gouvernements africains ont h&#233;rit&#233; de structures

administratives adapt&#233;es aux besoins des puissances coloniales. Il existait peu de liens avec les

syst&#232;mes gouvernementaux autochtones et ces puissances &#233;taient davantage

concern&#233;es par l'extraction des ressources naturelles que par le d&#233;veloppement

&#233;conomique et humain. En outre, les pays ind&#233;pendants se sont trouv&#233;s

confront&#233;s non seulement au besoin d'instaurer un syst&#232;me gouvernemental complet, mais

aussi au fait qu'ils devaient le faire dans un contexte de changement &#233;conomique et

technologique sans pr&#233;c&#233;dent. A ce tourbillon de changements s'est ajout&#233;, au cours

des dix derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, un changement cataclysmique: le changement id&#233;ologique

r&#233;pandu et fondamental concernant le r&ocirc;le de l'Etat dans le processus de

d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique. Cette mutation a permis de jeter un regard nouveau sur le

secteur priv&#233; en tant que moteur principal de croissance dans le cadre des march&#233;s et des

prix libres. 

<p>

Cependant, on a tr&#232;s t&ocirc;t consid&#233;r&#233; que cette commutation des strat&#233;gies

engendr&#233;e par cette id&#233;ologie n&#233;olib&#233;rale courait le danger d'aller trop loin et

de nuire &#224; la productivit&#233;. En dehors de l'importance de l'Etat dans la fourniture des

services relatifs &#224; la loi, l'ordre, la justice, la d&#233;fense, l'infrastructure, l'&#233;ducation et la

sant&#233;, il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; admis que les institutions du march&#233; libre ne

peuvent fonctionner que si les institutions gouvernementales fonctionnement elles aussi.

<p>

De plus, le d&#233;veloppement r&#233;el d'une structure politique capable dans le cadre de laquelle

des secteurs non gouvernementaux peuvent fonctionner de mani&#232;re plus efficace exige que l'on

mette davantage l'accent sur la disponibit&#233; d'une capacit&#233; institutionnelle forte &#224;

g&#233;rer la politique &#233;conomique (son application, son contr&ocirc;le et la formulation

r&#233;elle de politiques). La r&#233;forme du service public et le renforcement des capacit&#233;s

sont donc &#224; nouveau prioritaires dans l'agenda des politiques de d&#233;veloppement. Mais la

difficult&#233; porte toujours sur la meilleure fa&#231;on d'agir dans les conditions actuelles des pays

africains.<P>

<H3>Obstacles </H3>

<p>

Premi&#232;rement, il existe un paradoxe. Plus le processus de r&#233;forme est global et complexe,

plus la capacit&#233; de gestion exig&#233;e pour appliquer ce processus est importante. Cependant,

les pays qui ont le plus grand besoin de r&#233;formes sont souvent, et ce n'est pas surprenant, ceux

qui ont la plus faible capacit&#233; &#224; g&#233;rer ce processus. Affecter un plus grand nombre

de cadres exp&#233;riment&#233;s aux besoins de la r&#233;forme du service public am&#232;ne

in&#233;vitablement &#224; l&#233;ser les autres domaines de politique et de r&#233;forme

institutionnelle, qui sont tout aussi importants pour la r&#233;alisation des objectifs de

d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique. Des choix difficiles dans la r&#233;partition de cette faible

capacit&#233; de gestion sont in&#233;vitables. Le cas se produit d&#233;j&#224;: le domaine

limit&#233;, encore que consid&#233;rable, de la gestion de la politique macro-financi&#232;re a

tendance &#224; &ecirc;tre prioritaire &#224; cet &#233;gard. On peut &#233;videmment

pr&#233;tendre que le but principal de la r&#233;forme du service public est pr&#233;cis&#233;ment

d'accro&icirc;tre son efficacit&#233; et ainsi de renforcer sa capacit&#233; &#224; g&#233;rer tous les

aspects de la politique &#233;conomique et sociale. Par cons&#233;quent, on pourrait affirmer que

la plus grande priorit&#233; devrait &ecirc;tre accord&#233;e &#224; ce domaine. Bien que ceci puisse

s'av&#233;rer exact &#224; long terme, cela ne r&#233;duit en rien la difficult&#233; &#224; prendre

des d&#233;cisions au jour le jour, en particulier lorsque la plupart des gouvernements ont tendance

&#224; juger leur esp&#233;rance de vie &#224; court terme plut&ocirc;t qu'&#224; long terme.

<p>

Deuxi&#232;mement, il est n&#233;cessaire d'assurer la faisabilit&#233; des r&#233;formes dans

l'environnement politique, &#233;conomique et culturel existant et de garantir leur soutien par les

fonctionnaires. Un paradoxe appara&icirc;t une fois de plus. D'un c&ocirc;t&#233;, la r&#233;forme

implique des changements majeurs (souvent contradictoires) dans les compensations financi&#232;res,

les esp&#233;rances professionnelles, la s&#233;curit&#233; de l'emploi et autres conditions de travail

des fonctionnaires, g&#233;n&#233;rant in&#233;vitablement une atmosph&#232;re d'incertitude et

de malaise au sein du service. La r&#233;ussite de la r&#233;forme exige pourtant le soutien et

l'engagement des fonctionnaires. Gr&#226;ce &#224; leur connaissance des m&#233;canismes de

fonctionnement de l'administration publique, ils sont les plus aptes &#224; contribuer de

mani&#232;re significative &#224; l'introduction de mesures de r&#233;forme sens&#233;es et

applicables. L'absence de leur soutien peut entra&icirc;ner des retards et, dans les cas extr&ecirc;mes,

le blocage du processus de r&#233;forme. L'application effective des r&#233;formes exige que les

fonctionnaires de chaque service fassent preuve d'un niveau &#233;lev&#233; de moralit&#233;, de

professionnalisme et de loyaut&#233; (tout ce qui peut &ecirc;tre menac&#233; par les mesures de

r&#233;forme). 

<p>

Troisi&#232;mement, &#233;tant donn&#233; que la plupart des programmes de r&#233;forme du

service public ont &#233;t&#233; introduits en tant qu'&#233;l&#233;ments des programmes

d'ajustement structurel, ils ont &#233;t&#233; consid&#233;r&#233;s comme &#233;tant impos&#233;s

par l'ext&#233;rieur, par le FMI et la Banque mondiale, ou du moins consid&#233;r&#233;s comme tels.

Par ailleurs, ces programmes se pr&#233;occupant principalement de l'aspect macro-financier, ces

r&#233;formes se sont concentr&#233;es presque exclusivement sur la r&#233;duction du co&ucirc;t

budg&#233;taire du service public &#224; travers la diminution des niveaux des effectifs et des salaires.

<p>

Le dernier obstacle &#224; la r&#233;forme est l'absence des exp&#233;riences men&#233;es

r&#233;cemment sur les r&#233;formes, o&ugrave; que ce soit, &#224; un niveau jug&#233;

n&#233;cessaire dans les pays africains. Les mod&#232;les copi&#233;s sur des exp&#233;riences de pays

d&#233;velopp&#233;s sont largement hors de propos, en particulier parce que, dans leurs pratiques

et leurs m&#233;thodes plus institutionnalis&#233;es, tout changement introduit est habituellement

soutenu par des "filets de s&#233;curit&#233;" institutionnels qui ne sont pas disponibles en Afrique.

De plus, les pratiques de gestion du secteur priv&#233; import&#233;es dans certains pays ne se sont

pas toujours transplant&#233;es avec succ&#232;s, en partie parce que la r&#233;forme parall&#232;le

des proc&#233;dures de contr&ocirc;le et de r&#233;vision exig&#233;e pour introduire ces pratiques

ne s'op&#232;re pas simultan&#233;ment.

<p>

<H3>Aides -- conditions pour une r&#233;forme r&#233;ussie</H3>

<p>

Malgr&#233; les obstacles, il est encore possible d'identifier certains des &#233;l&#233;ments communs

&#224; plusieurs des programmes les plus r&#233;ussis. Ces programmes sont illustr&#233;s par

r&#233;f&#233;rence aux pays de l'Afrique anglophone. Il est cependant int&#233;ressant de noter que

les cl&#233;s du succ&#232;s sont tr&#232;s proches de celles identifi&#233;es dans les pays africains

francophones par Fofana dans son article. 

<p>

Premi&#232;rement, un soutien politique explicite des mesures de r&#233;forme est indispensable sur

une p&#233;riode prolong&#233;e. Il permet de garantir que les r&#233;formes seront soutenues dans

le temps. En Angleterre, le long r&#232;gne de Madame Thatcher au poste de Premier ministre

pendant les ann&#233;es 80 fournit un exemple &#233;vident d'engagement fort envers des

r&#233;formes profondes permettant d'op&#233;rer des changements dans les structures et le

comportement organisationnels, consid&#233;r&#233;s jusque l&#224; comme impossibles. En Afrique,

il convient de noter que le Ghana et l'Ouganda, qui ont entrepris tous deux la r&#233;forme du service

public avec succ&#232;s, ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d'une stabilit&#233; politique et d'une

continuit&#233; de gouvernement pendant une p&#233;riode de dix ans ou plus, ainsi que d'un

soutien du programme de r&#233;forme non d&#233;guis&#233; de la part du gouvernement.

<p>

Mais, et c'est la deuxi&#232;me condition, l'engagement politique doit &ecirc;tre renforc&#233; par

la mise en place d'un bureau de mise en oeuvre jouissant d'une influence et d'une autorit&#233;

suffisantes, ainsi que de la capacit&#233; intellectuelle et technique n&#233;cessaire pour formuler et

ex&#233;cuter le programme de r&#233;forme. Certains signes semblent indiquer que cet engagement

est en bonne voie. En Zambie, la responsabilit&#233; des r&#233;formes repose sur le secr&#233;taire

permanent de la division du d&#233;veloppement de la gestion du d&#233;partement minist&#233;riel.

Au Ghana et en Ouganda, le responsable de la r&#233;forme du service public est le chef du service

public. (Il est int&#233;ressant de noter qu'au Ghana, ce membre officiel a soit un rang

minist&#233;riel, soit un rang &#233;quivalent.) Une unit&#233; de coordination de la r&#233;forme et

un comit&#233; de r&#233;forme de l'administration ont &#233;t&#233; mis en place au Ghana

apr&#232;s qu'une &#233;tude men&#233;e en 1993 sur les exp&#233;riences de ce pays ait

r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; des faiblesses dans les domaines de la coordination et de l'&#233;valuation et

qu'elle ait permis de d&#233;tecter une transparence limit&#233;e de la culture de la r&#233;forme. 

<p>

Troisi&#232;mement, non seulement des objectifs clairement d&#233;finis sont n&#233;cessaires, mais

aussi des strat&#233;gies r&#233;alistes permettant de les r&#233;aliser: les moyens, la planification et

l'encha&icirc;nement des actions. Ce r&#233;alisme doit &ecirc;tre le reflet de l'environnement

politique et institutionnel d'un pays. En Zambie, par exemple, personne ne met en doute le besoin

d'un service public plus restreint et plus efficace qui r&#233;pondra aux besoins de gestion d'un

service gouvernemental moderne dans une p&#233;riode de changement politique majeur et de

difficult&#233; &#233;conomique grave. Mais en r&#233;alit&#233;, le service public, comme dans

beaucoup de pays africains, est une source consid&#233;rable d'emplois pour les jeunes

dipl&ocirc;m&#233;s. Par cons&#233;quent, il est difficile de juger jusqu'&#224; quel pont la

r&#233;duction du service public pourra &ecirc;tre tol&#233;r&#233;e par la soci&#233;t&#233; et le

syst&#232;me politique.

<p>

Ceci nous am&#232;ne au quatri&#232;me &#233;l&#233;ment du succ&#232;s, &#224; savoir une

communication efficace avec tous les acteurs et les parties prenantes ayant des int&#233;r&ecirc;ts

dans le processus de r&#233;forme du service public et avec tous les minist&#232;res et les agences

pouvant contribuer &#224; l'identification des probl&#232;mes, au d&#233;veloppement et &#224; la

mise en oeuvre des programmes de r&#233;forme. Mais l'exp&#233;rience montre que des discussions

aussi profondes sont souvent exp&#233;di&#233;es sans m&#233;nagement, en raison des contraintes

de temps lorsqu'il s'agit de montrer que "quelque chose a &#233;t&#233; fait" et &#233;galement en

raison de l'absence quasi totale de m&#233;thodes institutionnelles appropri&#233;es et d'individus

exp&#233;riment&#233;s pour faciliter de telles discussions. Ce dernier probl&#232;me est

habituellement aggrav&#233; par les activit&#233;s des bailleurs de fonds et des conseillers

ext&#233;rieurs qui, pour r&#233;pondre aux besoins et aux priorit&#233;s des programmes de

r&#233;forme dans lesquels ils sont impliqu&#233;s, tendent &#224; monopoliser le temps et les efforts

des individus exp&#233;riment&#233;s disponibles.

<p>

On aboutit ainsi &#224; la cinqui&#232;me et derni&#232;re condition du succ&#232;s, &#224; savoir

que, pour &ecirc;tre une r&#233;ussite, la r&#233;forme du service public doit "appartenir" aux

autorit&#233;s nationales. Des agences ext&#233;rieures, telles que la Banque mondiale ont un

r&ocirc;le &#224; jouer, mais un r&ocirc;le se limitant au soutien et &#224; la consultation, &#224;

l'instar des consultants sp&#233;cialis&#233;s auxquels les gouvernements des pays industrialis&#233;s

font appel pour d&#233;velopper leurs propres programmes de r&#233;forme. A maintes occasions,

les hauts fonctionnaires de la Banque mondiale ont nettement approuv&#233; l'importance de ce

r&ocirc;le secondaire des agences ext&#233;rieures et les implications qui l'accompagnent. Une de ces

implications est que la Banque mondiale ne doit pas remettre aux gouvernements un mod&#232;le

de mesures de r&#233;forme, mais bien reconna&icirc;tre l'importance cruciale de porter une

attention particuli&#232;re aux propositions du personnel local, administratif et politique, conscient

de ce qui peut &ecirc;tre mis en oeuvre ou non dans un pays. Cette approche exige cependant de

consacrer davantage de temps &#224; la phase de conception des programmes et &#224; leurs

strat&#233;gies de mise en oeuvre: une implication que les agences ext&#233;rieures, une fois encore,

ont non seulement accept&#233;e int&#233;gralement, mais affirment en plus &ecirc;tre essentielle

bien, que les m&#233;thodes pour la rendre fonctionnelle sont encore &#224; mettre en place. Une

autre implication concerne la politique traditionnelle de financement et de nomination des

expatri&#233;s de longue dur&#233;e pour concevoir et mettre en oeuvre des programmes de

r&#233;forme avec un homologue travaillant en parall&#232;le. Bien que la politique actuelle de

coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement cherche &#224; minimiser cette m&#233;thode, il est

probable que la pr&#233;sence d'experts sera n&#233;cessaire pendant un certain nombre

d'ann&#233;es. La strat&#233;gie utilis&#233;e doit garantir que ce sont bien les fonctionnaires locaux

qui sont charg&#233;s du programme, les agences ext&#233;rieures fournissant tout le support

technique suppl&#233;mentaire exig&#233;. 

<p>

<H3>Une approche globale</H3>

<p>

Ces cinq conditions pr&#233;liminaires pourraient ne pas suffire &#224; mener la r&#233;forme du

service public au succ&#232;s, mais certains signes semblent indiquer que leur pr&#233;sence en

augmente les chances. Elles devraient &ecirc;tre consid&#233;r&#233;es comme un ensemble au sein

duquel elles se renforceraient mutuellement. L'engagement politique n'est que tr&#232;s peu utile

si le gouvernement ne dispose pas des capacit&#233;s institutionnelles &#224; formuler et appliquer

un programme de r&#233;forme du service public. De mani&#232;re identique, il est important

d'admettre que les fonctionnaires ne sont pas les seuls &#224; &ecirc;tre impliqu&#233;s directement

dans cette capacit&#233;. Ces derniers doivent &#224; leur tour avoir la volont&#233; et la

capacit&#233; de faire appel aux connaissances et &#224; l'exp&#233;rience des autres minist&#232;res

et agences, aux individus et aux institutions des secteurs non gouvernementaux de la

soci&#233;t&#233;. Des mesures techniquement plus saines et politiquement plus r&#233;alisables en

seront la cons&#233;quence. 

<p>

La cinqui&#232;me condition concernant la propri&#233;t&#233; nationale sera d'autant plus facile

&#224; r&#233;aliser si les quatre premi&#232;res conditions pr&#233;alables sont satisfaites. Ces

conditions aboutiront en effet &#224; une relation plus &#233;quilibr&#233;e entre les responsables

du programme au sein de l'administration nationale et les agences ext&#233;rieures

fr&#233;quemment impliqu&#233;es. Les premiers sont plus susceptibles d'occuper une position forte

et d&#233;fendable, tandis que les derniers verront moins le besoin de jouer un r&ocirc;le trop

importun. Les agences ext&#233;rieures et les individus se soutenant mutuellement, on &#233;vitera

aux administrations africaines de devoir entrer en conflit lors de n&#233;gociations r&#233;alis&#233;es

avec des sources de financement ext&#233;rieures. Elles peuvent d&#233;tenir leurs programmes en

fait et en droit et acc&#233;der aux comp&#233;tences &#233;trang&#232;res lorsqu'elles le

demandent. Cependant, il est essentiel de ne pas sous-estimer le changement d'attitude et

d'approche que le processus cons&#233;cutif impliquera pour tous les acteurs engag&#233;s, qu'ils

soient issus des agences ext&#233;rieures ou des administrations nationales.

Conseil des ministres du d&#233;veloppement et de l'aide humanitaire de l'UE<br>

D&eacute;claration publi&eacute;e &agrave; la suite de la

r&eacute;union extraordinaire des ministres de l'Union europ&eacute;enne charg&eacute;s

du d&eacute;veloppement et de l'aide humanitaire, Bruxelles, 7 novembre 1996</h2>

<p>

<hr>

<P>

1. Une r&eacute;union extraordinaire des ministres de l'Union

europ&eacute;enne charg&eacute;s du d&eacute;veloppement et de

l'aide humanitaire s'est tenue &agrave; Bruxelles le 7 novembre

1996 pour examiner les &eacute;v&eacute;nements r&eacute;cents

intervenus dans la r&eacute;gion des Grands Lacs et pour discuter

de la situation humanitaire des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s et des

personnes d&eacute;plac&eacute;es dans l'est du Za&iuml;re, ainsi

que des moyens d'att&eacute;nuer la crise humanitaire et d'am&eacute;liorer

les perspectives d'aboutir &agrave; une solution durable. Les

ministres charg&eacute;s du d&eacute;veloppement et de l'aide

humanitaire de tous les Etats membres de l'UE, ou leurs repr&eacute;sentants,

ont particip&eacute; &agrave; la r&eacute;union, qui &eacute;tait

pr&eacute;sid&eacute;e par Mme Joan Burton, T.D., ministre adjoint

(&quot;Minister of State&quot;) dans le gouvernement irlandais.

La Commission &eacute;tait repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e par Mme Emma

Bonino et M. J. Pinheiro.

<P>

2. M. Pinheiro a fait une br&egrave;ve d&eacute;claration g&eacute;n&eacute;rale

sur la situation que conna&icirc;t la r&eacute;gion des Grands

Lacs et Mme Bonino a inform&eacute; les ministres de la r&eacute;ponse

humanitaire que la Commission a jusqu'ici apport&eacute;e &agrave;

la crise et a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; un plan d'action, qui sera

examin&eacute; imm&eacute;diatement et plus en d&eacute;tail au

sein du comit&eacute; comp&eacute;tent en mati&egrave;re d'aide

humanitaire. Mme Bonino a soulign&eacute; l'urgence d'une intervention

imm&eacute;diate pour att&eacute;nuer les souffrances des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s

et des personnes d&eacute;plac&eacute;es et a pr&eacute;sent&eacute;

des id&eacute;es concernant l'action &agrave; entreprendre. L'envoy&eacute;

sp&eacute;cial de l'UE dans la r&eacute;gion des Grands Lacs,

M. Ajello, a inform&eacute; les participants &agrave; la r&eacute;union

de la situation politique complexe qui r&egrave;gne actuellement

dans la r&eacute;gion. Le Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral

adjoint responsable du D&eacute;partement des affaires humanitaires,

M. Akashi, le Haut Commissaire des Nations Unies pour les r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s,

Mme Ogata, le Directeur de l'UNICEF, Mme Bellamy, le Directeur

ex&eacute;cutif adjoint du Programme alimentaire mondial, M. Graisse,

et le Directeur des op&eacute;rations du Comit&eacute; international

de la Croix-Rouge, M. De Courtin, ont &eacute;galement rendu compte

de l'&eacute;volution de la situation humanitaire dans la r&eacute;gion.

<P>

3. La r&eacute;union a r&eacute;affirm&eacute; la profonde pr&eacute;occupation

qu'inspirent &agrave; l'Union la d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration de

la situation dans l'est du Za&iuml;re et la menace qui p&egrave;se

sur la paix et la stabilit&eacute; dans l'ensemble de la r&eacute;gion

des Grands Lacs. La r&eacute;union a r&eacute;affirm&eacute; la

d&eacute;termination et l'engagement de l'Union de faire tout

ce qui est en son pouvoir en vue d'apporter une aide et une assistance

imm&eacute;diates aux personnes vuln&eacute;rables, aux r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s

et aux personnes d&eacute;plac&eacute;es dans l'est du Za&iuml;re,

de contribuer &agrave; pr&eacute;venir une nouvelle trag&eacute;die

humaine dans cette r&eacute;gion et &agrave; &eacute;viter un

d&eacute;sastre humanitaire, qui pourrait s'av&eacute;rer catastrophique

pour celle-ci.  La r&eacute;union a &eacute;galement r&eacute;affirm&eacute;

le point de vue de l'Union, selon lequel les probl&egrave;mes

complexes qui se posent ne peuvent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;solus que

par un dialogue qui doit &ecirc;tre engag&eacute; rapidement et

porter sur le fond des probl&egrave;mes, et a invit&eacute; une

nouvelle fois toutes les parties concern&eacute;es, y compris

en particulier le Za&iuml;re et le Rwanda, &agrave; amorcer ce

processus d&egrave;s que possible. La r&eacute;union a reconnu

le lien &eacute;troit qui existe entre les besoins humanitaires

imm&eacute;diats et les questions politiques plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rales

qui sous-tendent le conflit, ainsi que la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

d'aborder ces deux probl&egrave;mes de mani&egrave;re globale.



<P>

4. A cet &eacute;gard, la r&eacute;union a exprim&eacute; son

plein appui aux efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s par les Nations

Unies, les dirigeants de la r&eacute;gion et l'Organisation de

l'unit&eacute; africaine pour faciliter un r&egrave;glement pacifique

et global du conflit et a r&eacute;affirm&eacute; la volont&eacute;

de l'Union d'y contribuer par tous les moyens possibles. Elle

s'est f&eacute;licit&eacute;e des r&eacute;sultats du Sommet des

chefs d'Etat de la r&eacute;gion qui s'est tenu &agrave; Nairobi

le 5 novembre. La r&eacute;union a fait sien l'appel lanc&eacute;

par les chefs d'Etat dans leur communiqu&eacute; de presse pour

qu'intervienne un cessez-le-feu imm&eacute;diat, qui devrait &ecirc;tre

strictement respect&eacute; pour permettre l'intensification des

efforts diplomatiques afin d'instaurer une paix durable. La r&eacute;union

a partag&eacute; le point de vue exprim&eacute; par les chefs

d'Etat de la r&eacute;gion en ce qui concerne l'importance que

rev&ecirc;tent  l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; territoriale du Za&iuml;re,

conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la charte de l'OUA et, en particulier,

&agrave; la d&eacute;claration du Caire de 1964, la fin des incursions

dans d'autres Etats et les droits inali&eacute;nables de toutes

les personnes, y compris les droits &agrave; une citoyennet&eacute;

et &agrave; une nationalit&eacute;. La r&eacute;union s'est f&eacute;licit&eacute;e

de l'appel lanc&eacute; par les chefs d'Etat en vue de l'instauration

imm&eacute;diate de corridors s&ucirc;rs et de zones prot&eacute;g&eacute;es

temporaires &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur du Za&iuml;re pour faciliter

l'aide humanitaire et le rapatriement des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s

et a pris note de la demande qu'ils ont adress&eacute;e &agrave;

cet &eacute;gard au Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; en vue du

d&eacute;ploiement d'une &quot;force neutre&quot;. La r&eacute;union

s'est &eacute;galement f&eacute;licit&eacute;e de l'appel lanc&eacute;

par les chefs d'Etat en vue d'une intensification des efforts

destin&eacute;s &agrave; favoriser un rapatriement volontaire

des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s au Rwanda et d'une &quot;mise en oeuvre

de la d&eacute;cision prise de longue date de s&eacute;parer les

auteurs d'intimidations et les v&eacute;ritables r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s&quot;.

La r&eacute;union a &eacute;galement soulign&eacute; qu'il importait

de soutenir le processus d&eacute;mocratique au Za&iuml;re.

<P>

5. La r&eacute;union a not&eacute; qu'il &eacute;tait urgent de

prendre des dispositions sp&eacute;ciales &agrave; court terme

pour assurer une situation stable en mati&egrave;re de s&eacute;curit&eacute;

dans l'est du Za&iuml;re, afin de faciliter tant les t&acirc;ches

humanitaires n&eacute;cessaires que le processus de dialogue.

Elle a not&eacute; que des efforts &eacute;taient d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s

&agrave; cette fin par le Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, compte

tenu des r&eacute;centes propositions qui ont &eacute;t&eacute;

formul&eacute;es. Les ministres espagnol et fran&ccedil;ais ont

inform&eacute; les participants &agrave; la r&eacute;union de

leur proposition &agrave; cet &eacute;gard, visant &agrave; mettre

en place une force temporaire &agrave; des fins strictement humanitaires

afin de permettre l'acheminement de l'aide vers les populations

concern&eacute;es.

<P>

6. Dans ce contexte, la r&eacute;union a rappel&eacute; les conclusions

du Conseil europ&eacute;en de Florence des 21 et 22 juin 1996,

selon lesquelles le Conseil &quot;reste favorable &agrave; la

convocation d'une conf&eacute;rence internationale sous les auspices

communs des Nations Unies et de l'Organisation de l'unit&eacute;

africaine afin d'examiner les causes profondes des crises dans

une perspective globale et d'assurer le respect des engagements

qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; souscrits&quot;.

<P>

7. La r&eacute;union a rendu un hommage chaleureux &agrave; l'envoy&eacute;

sp&eacute;cial de l'UE pour les efforts qu'il d&eacute;ploie au

nom de l'UE afin de faciliter un r&egrave;glement pacifique du

conflit et de r&eacute;pondre aux besoins humanitaires imm&eacute;diats

et elle s'est f&eacute;licit&eacute;e du fait que M. Ajello poursuivra

le travail qu'il effectue dans la r&eacute;gion &agrave; cet &eacute;gard.

Elle a formul&eacute; l'espoir qu'une coordination &eacute;troite

s'instaurera entre lui et l'envoy&eacute; sp&eacute;cial du Secr&eacute;taire

g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Nations Unies r&eacute;cemment d&eacute;sign&eacute;,

M. l'Ambassadeur Raymond Chr&eacute;tien.

<P>

8. La r&eacute;union a d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'envoyer imm&eacute;diatement

une mission sp&eacute;ciale compos&eacute;e des ministres du d&eacute;veloppement

d'Irlande, des Pays-Bas et de l'Italie, ainsi que de Mme Bonino,

et charg&eacute;e d'&eacute;valuer la situation humanitaire et

de d&eacute;terminer les moyens d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer l'aide

humanitaire. L'envoy&eacute; sp&eacute;cial de l'UE participera

aussi &agrave; cette mission. Les conclusions en seront communiqu&eacute;es

d'urgence au Conseil &quot;Affaires g&eacute;n&eacute;rales&quot;.

<P>

9. La r&eacute;union a rappel&eacute; l'engagement pris par l'Union

d'encourager le retour volontaire des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s dans

leurs pays d'origine. Elle a fortement soulign&eacute; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

d'assurer des corridors humanitaires s&ucirc;rs et prot&eacute;g&eacute;s

pour faciliter l'acheminement de secours imm&eacute;diats en nature

vers les victimes de la crise  l&agrave; o&ugrave; elles se trouvent,

ainsi que le retour  volontaire, en toute s&eacute;curit&eacute;

et dans la dignit&eacute;, des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s dans leurs

pays d'origine. La n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'appuyer les efforts

en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement  ainsi que de renforcer

le syst&egrave;me juridique, notamment au Rwanda, afin de faciliter

l'int&eacute;gration des r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s revenus au pays

a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; relev&eacute;e. 

<P>

10. La r&eacute;union a reconnu la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de

travailler de mani&egrave;re coordonn&eacute;e avec les ONG et

organismes humanitaires internationaux pour apporter une r&eacute;ponse

humanitaire efficace  &agrave; la crise et elle a soulign&eacute;

le r&ocirc;le de coordination du DHA dans le syst&egrave;me des

Nations Unies. Elle a pris acte des besoins en ressources des

organismes humanitaires et a reconnu qu'il importe de faire en

sorte que des ressources soient d&eacute;gag&eacute;es d'urgence

pour les priorit&eacute;s arr&ecirc;t&eacute;es d'un commun accord.

La r&eacute;union a lanc&eacute; un appel &agrave; toutes les

parties de la r&eacute;gion pour qu'elles assurent la s&eacute;curit&eacute;

et la libert&eacute; de circulation de tout le personnel charg&eacute;

des op&eacute;rations d'aide humanitaire internationale.

<P>

11. Depuis le d&eacute;but de la crise dans la r&eacute;gion des

Grands Lacs en 1994, l'aide humanitaire apport&eacute;e par la

Communaut&eacute; europ&eacute;enne et ses Etats membres s'est

&eacute;lev&eacute;e &agrave; quelque 755 millions d'&eacute;cus.

Lors de la r&eacute;union, les organismes humanitaires ont indiqu&eacute;

qu'ils seront bient&ocirc;t en mesure d'adresser &agrave; la Communaut&eacute;

et aux Etats membres des demandes concernant des besoins pr&eacute;cis.

Il a &eacute;t&eacute; convenu que ces demandes seront trait&eacute;es

avec la plus grande urgence.

<P>

12. Les ministres ont soulign&eacute; que l'ampleur de la crise

humanitaire que conna&icirc;t actuellement la r&eacute;gion des

Grands Lacs exige une r&eacute;action coh&eacute;rente et concert&eacute;e

au niveau international. Il a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;affirm&eacute;

que l'Union jouera pleinement son r&ocirc;le dans cette t&acirc;che.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Portuguese Development Cooperation</h3>



Portuguese development cooperation started in the late 1980s after Portugal joined the European

Community, from which Portugal still receives considerable assistance. In 1991 Portugal rejoined the DAC,

after it had left the organisation in 1974 when it requested to be considered a developing country.

Development cooperation, constituting a substantial part of Portuguese foreign relations, is based upon its

historic links, common language and economic interests in former colonies. However, since some time

efforts are undertaken to transform these policies, activities and their administration into a broader and more

structural model of development cooperation. There is a small but growing public support - and press

attention - for the latter type of development cooperation. The majority of the Portuguese population

perceives that it has an obligation towards the former colonies where previously about ten per cent of its

population lived, but also sees Portugal as a country not yet sufficiently developed itself.

<p>

Net official development assistance almost doubled since 1989 to US $ 302 million in 1992, which was 0.36

per cent of GNP, mainly through debt-rescheduling operations. Forecasts on the aid volume are difficult,

since relevant data are absent, but it will certainly be lower in the years after 1992. 16 per cent of ODA was

channelled through the EU in 1992, while multilateral aid, excluding EU contributions stood at 4 per cent.

For the coming years total multilateral ODA should stabilise on 25 per cent.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Portugal does not have a written charter for development cooperation, nor a central aid budget. Aid is not

clearly distinguished in the distinct budgets of the various ministries involved in development assistance. The

aid administration could be characterised as decentralised. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for

formulating development cooperation policy. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has delegated his authority to

a State Secretary for Development Cooperation. The government institutions responsible for development

assistance are presently being reorganised, in order to create a centralised aid administration. There used to

be a Directorate-General for Cooperation (DGC, since 1979), responsible for the bilateral socio-cultural,

scientific, and technical sectors of bilateral assistance. The Institute for Economic Cooperation (ICE, since

1976), an autonomous body responsible to both the MFA and the Ministry of Finance, is in charge of

financial, economic and entrepreneurial activities, including refinancing operations and most multilateral

contributions. In 1990 the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs together accounted for

almost 90 per cent of total ODA disbursements, with a rapidly growing share of the Ministry of Finance.

<p>

These DGC and ICE will merge into a new Agency, the Portuguese Institute for Cooperation (ICP), the

head of which will be the coordinator of all development cooperation activities, including those parts that

presently are under the responsibility of other Ministries.

<p>

Many ministries and institutions are involved in parts of the aid programme, dating back to the period when

they had direct ties with their respective counterparts in the former colonies. About ten per cent (1990) of

total ODA was shared by the Ministries of Planning and Administration, Youth and Mass Media,

Employment and Social Security, Education, Health, Defence and Internal Administration, and Public

Works, Transport and Communications. Depending on the area of work, their activities are sometimes

coordinated by the ICE or the DGC. In 1991 a Fund for Economic Cooperation (FCE) was established for

extending financial support to the PALOP's and other developing countries - falling within the general

development cooperation framework - and to promote Portuguese direct investments and trade related

projects. The Credits Insurance Company (COSEC) operates in all foreign countries for the insurance of

Portuguese investments.

<p>

It is not known whether a (central) policy planning unit for development cooperation does exist. In 1985 an

Interministerial Commission for Cooperation (CIC) was set up for the coordination of the aid programme. It

has only met three times since. The CIC includes representatives of DGC, ICE, and the other ministries

involved in aid. In the envisaged reorganisation of the administrational set-up, the CIC will be revitalised,

and start with regular meetings on sector-policies, and possibly merged with the CCC.

<p> 

Presently, in consultations with the developing countries concerned, two year 'framework programmes' for

cooperation are worked out. Common norms for handling of aid requests have been worked out by the DGC

and the ICE. Within the new set-up streamlining of procedures and the elaboration of planning, assessment

and evaluation mechanisms are foreseen. 

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

An Advisory Commission for Cooperation (CCC) was created in 1985. It includes representatives of the

implementing bodies and ministries, including the COSEC, the Investments, Trade and Tourism Agency

(ICEP), the Agency for Investments and Entrepreneurial Participation (IPE), as well as various trade and

investment associations. Parliamentarians and NGOs are not represented, only commercial interests. The

CCC has never met since its creation, although it was supposed to meet twice a year. Also the CCC might

be revitalised within the re-organisation of the aid administration and possibly be merged with the CIC. Both

the CIC and the CCC are chaired by the Secretary of State for Development Cooperation.

<p>

In addition, the Portuguese Association for Economic Development and Cooperation (ELO) has to be

mentioned. ELO is a non-profit organisation founded by the private sector, and funded by Portuguese

business communities that work in Lusophone countries. It acts as the Development Cooperation Agency of

the private sector. One of ELO's objectives for the coming years is to ensure the improvement of the

contacts between the Government, the NGOs and the private sector. It is very much in favour of the

establishment of a transparent consultative structure between these three actors. It has asked the Government

to take initiatives in this direction. ELO considers attention for the social, cultural and scientific aspects of

development cooperation essential for effective economic cooperation. It is of the opinion that available

knowledge and information on these aspects should be coordinated.

<p>

In Parliament the Commission on Foreign Affairs regularly receives reports of the DGC and the ICE.

However, there is no regular scrutiny by Parliament.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

In Portugal 36 NGOs are involved in development cooperation. They only get a limited support from

government funds; their development work is for the greater part co-financed by the EU. Since 1985 there is

a representative Platform of NGOs with an Executive Committee. Recognising the importance of the role of

NGOs however, the Government has initiated discussions with the NGOs on the possibilities for establishing

a more structural and effective mutual relationship. NGOs demand more transparency of Government aid

policies and procedures and more information on Government aid activities. The Government also finances

directly NGO activities in developing countries.

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey in Portugal 12 institutes are involved in development research

and training. It is not known to what extent they participate in government cooperation activities.

From words to deeds: Gender and development,<br>

the fourth UN World Women's Conference in Beijing, 1995</h2>

<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>

<p>

Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 12, August 1995</h4>

<h5>The full text of the report in English, as well as a list of other publications, are available free of

charge from the Council's secretariat: E-mail: nar-dgis@dgis.minbuza.nl</h5>

</center>

<hr>

<b>

This was the title of recommendation no. 106, submitted on 22 August 1995 by the

Netherlands'  National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) to the Minister for

Development Cooperation, Jan Pronk.</b>

<p>

The NAR notes with concern the increase in violence, especially sexual violence, directed against

women throughout the world. The Council believes that violence against women and girls would

not be so widespread if it were not based on equally widespread acceptance, on the part of both

society and governments.

<p>

The Council supports the Netherlands Government's present policy, which unequivocally rejects

female circumcision. However, the Netherlands should make efforts to promote the

implementation of international agreements and conventions, if necessary through the use of

coercive measures, to stop or curb increasing violence against women. This view is set out in

the NAR report `From words to deeds', which was commissioned by the Minister for

Development Cooperation in the run-up to the fourth UN World Women's Conference to be held

between 4 and 14 September 1995 in Beijing.

<p>

The Council focuses its recommendations on gender and development on three themes: women

and poverty, women and human rights, and women and decision-making. These provide a

framework within which a look is taken at all the `Critical Areas of Concern' set out in the draft

programme of action of the fourth UN World Women's Conference. The Council consistently

bases its recommendations on the need for a transformation of existing gender relations. This

means that gender-related issues have consistently to be integrated into general policy. Men

should be emphatically reminded of their responsibilities in the process, so that women can

realise their sexual and social rights. It is crucial that the World Women's Conference results in a

genuine plan of action for women: `Not words, but deeds'.

<p>

The Council sees the promotion and implementation of human rights, notably economic, social

and cultural rights, as a strategic method of linking the results of a number of UN conferences.

The Council urges greater recognition of the universality of human rights, inter alia through the

adoption of a code of conduct governing the extent of the restrictions which governments are

permitted to impose on them. Furthermore, the Council argues that the supervisory mechanisms

to enforce compliance with ESC rights should be strengthened and the scope for individuals to

appeal against violations of such rights expanded. The last point is crucial to women, if they are

to achieve greater autonomy and more just relations between the sexes. The Council also

recommends that calls be made in Beijing for the adoption of a right of petition in respect of ESC

rights by making states party to the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and

Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Moreover, the Council supports the Dutch Government's efforts to

promote the adoption of an additional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms

of Discrimination Against Women, which would accord both individuals and states the right of

petition.

<p>

The Council notes with approval that it is now recognised that improvement of women's

position is a goal in itself and not simply an instrument to other ends. Nevertheless, such an

improvement can help to resolve international problems such as poverty, environmental

degradation, violence, unemployment and social disintegration.

<p>

It is against this background that the NAR has made a large number of recommendations, both

for the fourth World Women's Conference and in the context of Dutch policy on development

cooperation. They include:

<ul>

<li>renewal of the social sector: restructuring programmes for developing countries should take

account of their potentially negative impact - both direct and indirect - on the position of

women; in a number of countries (particularly developing countries) the economic position of

women has done nothing but deteriorate, influenced by such factors as a fall in real wages; new

technologies have often resulted in an increased workload and less favourable working

conditions for women, who still have to combine work outside the home with domestic duties;

<p>

<li>conventional statistics and economic data, in which female labour has scarcely figured up

to now, should reflect the quantitative and qualitative contributions made by women to

development; the visibility of their contribution is an essential condition if their economic

situation is to be improved;

<p>

<li>defining sexual rights: at the 1994 Population Conference in Cairo these were discussed

only in the context of women's health and reproduction; the Council feels a broader framework

is needed, and defines sexual rights as follows:

<p>

<ul>

<li>`Sexual rights (sexual in the sense of `sexuality', rather than `gender') could be understood

to mean the right of individuals - women and men - freely to interpret sexuality in their own

way, free from coercion, discrimination or violence, without this resulting in a violation of the

rights of others, sexual or otherwise.'

</ul>

<p>

<li>participation of women in political and social decision-making; the Council rejects `parity

democracy' (reserved seats in representative bodies), since it places women in a separate

domain; the important thing is to remove obstacles to participation by taking measures in the

fields of education, health care, work, child care, media and culture, and to redistribute

responsibilities between women and men;

<p>

<li>an international equal opportunities task force, which should be given a coordinating role

within the UN, with duties that would include reinforcing existing agencies in the fields of gender

and women in development; the World Women's Conference should modify the preliminary

studies for the `Agenda for Development' proposed by the Secretary-General of the UN; at

present they have too little to say about gender and women in development; in the context of

the proposed UN reforms, systematic attention should also be paid to a review of personnel

policy and `corporate culture' with a view to furthering the participation of women; the Council

is dubious about the value of target figures in isolation;

<p>

<li>an increase rather than a reduction in resources for Dutch policy on gender and

development; to be maintained after the review of Dutch foreign policy;

<p>

<li>priority for the implementation and evaluation of the impact of Dutch policy on gender and

women in development, rather than for the drafting of new policy; although the Netherlands was

one of the first to develop much of the policy and many of the instruments in this field,

operationalisation of activities and programmes has failed to keep pace. The Council warns of

the risk of producing too much policy; 

<p>

<li>strengthening the position of women in conflict prevention and settlement; many women

and NGOs are active throughout the world in the cause of disarmament and peace; at present

insufficient advantage is being taken of this potential resource.

</ul>

<p>

In an earlier comment on the UNDP's 1995 Human Development  Report (published on 16

August 1995), which referred, inter alia, to the use of a `gender inequality index', various

Council members drew attention to the risks of measurement and quantification without

sufficient operationalisation of activities which really increase women's opportunities and

potential.

<p>

The Council hopes that the fact the Conference is being held in Beijing will have a positive

impact on thinking in China on democratisation and human rights, especially its policy on

population. This policy has seriously undermined women's right of self-determination in respect

of their own bodies and their right to choose the number of children they wish to have and when

they wish to have them, by subjecting them to measures such as enforced abortion.

<p>

The NAR does not regard this fourth World Women's Conference as the last of its kind. Despite

the problems attendant on such a huge operation, another such conference should be placed on

the agenda for the year 2000, so that UN member states are made to comply with their

reporting obligations and NGOs given the opportunity to question governments on their progress.

<TITLE>The Week in Europe</TITLE>

The Week in Europe, 7 November 1996</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the Caribbean Council for Europe</h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

Can sovereignty ever be compromised and if so are politicians alone able to

take responsibility for agreeing to such a step? In an increasingly

interdependent world this  issue and its associated questions are fast

becoming one of, if not the leading political issue in both the Caribbean

and the EU.

<p>

During the cold war, sovereignty and its protection at all costs was the

norm. Otherwise, it was argued, where would the West or the East be if

compromises led to a shift in political allegiance? It was the cement that

kept the Berlin Wall in place until the people of eastern Europe realised

that it was an issue that belonged to them not government. 

<p>

All that has been blown away by first, the ending of the cold war and its

geo-political certainties and more recently by the unstoppable process of

globalisation. Whereas in the past political parties found their politics

defined by the need to defend sovereignty, they are today, almost without

exception, struggling to define to their people their competence in a world

in which the markets take the decisions. Governments and political parties

are having now to decide whether to choose between pragmatism, whether to

take the moral high ground by arguing for the status quo or, if they are

clever, trying to redefine what sovereignty now means. 

<p>

In the Caribbean this can be seen in the varying responses to the question

of co-operation on narcotics issues with nations outside the region. In

Europe the debate focuses on the establishment of the European Monetary

System and the ever growing body of EU regulations overriding national

legislation. Internationally it is reflected in the US Congress's desire to

extend its powers to attempt to control trade by third nations with Cuba,

Libya and Iran. And less exciting, but just as potent, is the threat to

sovereignty posed by the extension of European or US reciprocal free trade

areas to many regions including the Caribbean. 

<p>

The Caribbean's most recent encounter with the question of sovereignty came

in the context of US insistence on hot pursuit of narcotics traffickers

through shiprider and other agreements which seek to allow US agencies to

operate within the jurisdiction of  Caribbean nations. Caribbean

governments took different positions on this issue. A number argued, quite

rightly, that it was one matter to allow such operations within territorial

waters through special treaty arrangements and quite another to grant such

privileges onshore. Legal experts and those concerned with consistency

argued otherwise and suggested this was a false dichotomy. But to citizens

and politicians it is a matter that reached to the heart of what government

and representative democracy were all about. 

<p>

On these questions perception matters. Citizens want the right to decide

who does what in their own country and few if any vote to allow another

state to take decisions for or act directly in their nation. That is why

sovereignty is a populist issue which cannot be dealt with lightly and

requires great sensitivity on the part of all if serious confrontations are

to be avoided.  It is not about the evil of narcotics trafficking but about

the role and existence of nation states.

<p>

The same is true in Europe as witnessed by the heated debate now underway

over the European Monetary Union (EMU). This mechanism envisaged by the

Maastricht Treaty is meant to create a single EU currency from 1998 onwards

. It has the capacity to split Europe. Already nations such as Britain,

Italy and Greece that are unlikely to meet the convergence criteria, unless

they like France massage their figures, are growing increasingly angry and

concerned at a number of levels. Criticism runs from technical arguments by

bankers through to a sentimental attachment to, for instance, the pound

sterling. But most potent of all is the arguments comes from those who see

EMU as a threat to sovereignty. They argue that individual states should

not give control of economic decisions over questions such as base rates

and money supply to the stronger economies in Europe. Such decisions they

suggest are what makes a state sovereign.

<p>

The issue of  the exercise of sovereignty is also becoming more complex as

evidenced by the acrimonious debate between the EU, the US and the

Caribbean over the US Helms/Burton legislation on Cuba. First the US

Congress sought to impose its will on the world at large, then the EU

agreed to retaliate and in the week past, the US and EU have begun to

attempt to find common ground on Cuba over measures that they hope might

encourage democracy and the growth of civic society there. Forgotten in all

of this is Cuba's intense nationalism, the fact that its revolution was

based on the people's desire to see a re-assertion of sovereignty against

the US and the subsequent guiding principle that sovereignty can never be

compromised.

<p>

Less likely to engender such political passion as yet, is the desire to

establish over time free trade areas (FTAs) with the hemisphere by the

United States and the EU, if it decides to extend its thinking after the

year 2000 about FTAs for Latin America to the Caribbean. As these ideas are

taken forward the Caribbean is likely to find itself standing at a

metaphorical cross-roads in the debate about sovereignty as both the US and

EU FTA processes will, over time, require reciprocity. Unlike Brazil where

its size and economic and political muscle will continue to determine its

freedom of action, Caribbean islands may find that reciprocity eventually

removes from government the ability to determine many aspects of economic

policy. 

<p>

All of this is not to suggest that the free trade process, the structure of

the post war world or globalisation can in some way be changed or ignored

but that Caribbean solutions will have to be found that seek to redefine

and educate the people about the new nature of sovereignty and by extension

government's role.

<p>

The danger is that if in parallel to the many other complex issues that the

region has to consider this component is not fully debated, governments may

loose touch with popular sentiment. A lack of clarity may also lead outside

of the region to the assumption that wholly unacceptable solutions such as

that proposed by US ex Assistant Secretary of State, Eliot Abrams, may be a

viable way forward. In his little read but often talked about paper "The 

Shiprider Solution" he suggested in part that the US take charge of 

defence and foreign policy in smaller Caribbean States in return for

guarantees of aid. This profoundly undemocratic thought, which challenges

every concept of sovereignty, rightly brought indignation in the Caribbean.

But what the anger also showed was a sense of uncertainty about the future.

<p>

As in Europe, there is a pressing need in the Caribbean to debate how

nation states,  particularly those that are small, define and retain

sovereignty now that open economies and trade advantage, rather than

political ideology, have come to dominate the global agenda.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of German Development Cooperation</h3>



German development cooperation started in the 1950s. Initially it was implemented mainly through private

and independent organisations; some of which originally were created for reconstruction purposes in

Germany after the Second World War (for instance the Credit Institute for Reconstruction, KfW in 1948).

Development cooperation is strongly supported by the Government and the public for political and

humanitarian reasons, and been widely debated and discussed. Presently, the rather well informed public

seems to shift its attention towards more structural global problems and the need for changes in the North,

while domestic problems seem to be a greater cause for concern.

<p>

German net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 7 572 million, or 0.39 per cent of GNP.

After a substantial increase in the late 1980s the volume might drop under the DAC average of 0.33 per

cent in the coming years. A fairly constant 30 per cent of ODA is being disbursed through multilateral

channels: in 1992 15 per cent, plus 16 per cent through the EU.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Official development cooperation is not based on an organic law. Development aid is regulated through

various specific laws. The competency for development cooperation of the Federal Government and the

Federal States ('L&#228;nder') is laid down in the chancellor's decisions of 1962 and 1988. The Federal

Government is responsible for the overall policy, planning and coordination, the States have declared

themselves responsible for assisting in the implementation of projects, training in Germany, and providing

experts and research facilities.

<p>

Technical and financial development cooperation is the responsibility of the Minister for Economic

Cooperation, who is a full member of Cabinet, and who heads the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and

Development (BMZ, created in 1961). There is also a State Secretary for Development Cooperation.

General political relations with developing countries are the competence of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs,

external economic relations (including trade) of the Minister for Economics and monetary policy is the

competence of the Minister for Finance. Budgets for development cooperation need the approval of the

Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance before the are sent to Parliament. After the Unification and the

abolishment of the Ministry for Economic Cooperation of the former GDR Affairs (MWZ, founded in

1990), a temporary service was set up in Berlin, which is to be integrated into the BMZ. 

<p>

In 1990 about a quarter of total ODA was provided by other departments: the Ministry for Foreign Affairs

(mainly for cultural and humanitarian assistance), and the Federal Lnder (mainly for scholarships (imputed

students costs) and technical assistance), other federal departments (mainly the Ministries for Finance, for

Agriculture and for Economics) and the KfW, a credit institute for capital assistance. Formulation of aid

policies is BMZ's responsibility. However, all major projects and programmes are submitted by BMZ to all

other ministries that might be interested, in particular the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Finance

Ministry, and the Ministry for Economics. 

<p>

Implementation of aid is mainly subcontracted to two autonomous institutions: the German Agency for

Technical Cooperation (GTZ), and the KfW. Although most projects are implemented by these two

institutions, outside experts and institutes are often involved. For many sectors there are specialised

institutes - a.o. voluntary sending organisations and NGOs - that are involved in implementation,

independently and/or in cooperation with the Government, for instance the DEG (German Corporation for

Investment and Development), a promotion institute for cooperation between private enterprises. Various

channels of assistance and instruments are integrated in one country policy, project or programme.

<p>

Within the BMZ the Division for Regional Development Policy is amongst others responsible for country

related planning and coordination, while the Division for Targets and Planning for Development Policy

amongst others elaborates the principles and objectives of sectoral and inter-sectoral policy. 

<p>

In addition to BMZ eleven other departments, with which BMZ has long standing arrangements, manage

certain parts of ODA. In order to improve the, sometimes difficult, relationship between the BMZ and GTZ,

new organisational management structures for both institutions were implemented in 1988. However, the

final authority of the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development still seems to be limited.

Interministerial communication appears to be ad hoc, and often limited to implementation level.

<p>

Basic policy papers were formulated successively in 1971, 1980 and 1991, when new criteria and indicators

were written. In addition, BMZ elaborates country concepts and -reports, (cross-) sector policy papers and

guidelines for the selection and assessment of projects, which are regularly up-dated. They are for internal

use only. Evaluations are frequently conducted and analyzed by a special unit in BMZ. They are made

available to the departments concerned and to the implementing agencies. Summaries of evaluations are

published. In 1991 a KfW evaluation report on a large number of projects was also published.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

The BMZ has a Scientific Advisory Council to the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development

(Beirat). The Council was installed in 1963. It is the task of the Council to advise and consult the Minister

on all issues concerning economic cooperation. The Council is an independent body that expresses its views

either on request of the Minister or at its own initiative in so-called 'statement-papers' or ad-hoc

consultations.

<p>

The nomination of new members is the exclusively the responsibility of the current members. Nominated

members are subsequently appointed by the Minister for a period of six years, that can be extended with one

more term. The members represent various academic fields and practical experiences in development

cooperation. The council presently has 25 members. One of the staff members of the policy planning

division at BMZ acts as the contact person for the Council. In addition, the chairman of the Council may

employ an assistant and a part-time secretary.

<p>

The Council meets three times a year. Discussion papers for the plenary sessions are prepared by small

working groups. During the plenary meetings the papers are discussed intensively. Revised papers are

presented to the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development as an input into the discussion on

specific topics within the Ministry. Usually the Minister and/or his representatives attend the discussions of

the Council. The distinct scientific background of the members serves to ensure a sufficient input from

relevant sciences and experiences.

<p>

Apart from plenary meetings, the Council occasionally organises symposiums, for which a wider spectre of

participants is invited. Experts from NGOs, governmental agencies or researchers from disciplines not

represented in the Council, give presentations on topics on which the Council envisages to prepare a paper.

The Council does not have a budget. For the financing of activities, e.g. to have research done on its

behalf, it has to submit a request to the Ministry.

<p>

The Council elaborates contributions to the formulation of development strategies and objectives. It does not

deal with problems of management or administration. Recently statements were presented on the EU Sugar

Protocol, the role of NGOs, Agriculture, and on Migration (published). The Council will continue its series

of statements on development cooperation in the 1990s. At the time of compiling this survey decisions

proposals for subjects and forthcoming studies were being discussed. A selected number of statements is

published by the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in the series 'BMZ Aktuell'. These

are in German. 

<p>

Development cooperation is discussed actively in Parliament and in the Standing Committee on Development

Cooperation as well as in the Budget Committee. 

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

Project-cooperation with NGOs traditionally has been considerable in Germany. Of the approximately 2000

national and local NGOs about 150 receive financial government support, amounting to a constant 9 per cent

of total German ODA per year. Roughly four broad categories of NGOs can be distinguished: the numerous

Church-related NGOs that have their own, very substantial, fundraising and co-financing agreements with

BMZ for project-implementation; political foundations: NGOs for political education that are affiliated with

the five political parties, and are 100 per cent financed by the Government; 'other NGOs', not-related to

churches or political parties, organised in the 'Bensheimer Kreis' and local NGOs that are active in

advocacy and solidarity activities within Germany. 

<p>

NGOs are organised in several large umbrella organisations. They have a high profile and considerable

influence on the policy debate through their formal and informal contacts with the Government, politicians

and the press. NGOs share a common concern on many issues with BMZ. However, they lobby for more

policy coherence and a stronger government commitment to poverty alleviation. Although policy dialogues

between BMZ and the NGO community have been intensified, there is no formal consultation mechanism.

NGOs advise the Government on the elaboration of new sectoral and country concepts, and on the

development of effective project approaches. 

BMZ carries out frequent and substantial research in cooperation with research institutes. The German

Institute for Development Policy (DIE), funded by BMZ and the City of Berlin, provides expertise on

development policy and trains German postgraduates in the field of development economics. German

(Technical) Universities provide expertise on a wide range of development subjects. According to the 1991

OECD/EADI survey there are 60 Development Research and Training Institutes in (West-) Germany. It is

not know what has been left of the development expertise that existed in the former German Democratic

Republic. 

<p>

Business interests, a.o. organised in a Working Group on Developing Countries chaired by the Federation of

German Industry, consult periodically with the BMZ.

<P>


<hr><B>1. The Aid Policy Framework</B>


<P>


In accordance with the law on international development cooperation


the Minister for Development Cooperation once a year submits to


the Danish Parliament a plan for the expenditure framework of


the development cooperation for the next five-year period. The


plan reflects the order of priority - which is continuously adjusted


- in the preparation of Danish development assistance.


<P>


<B>The new development strategy: &quot;A Developing World&quot;</B>


<P>


On 22 March 1994 the Government submitted to the Danish Parliament


a new development strategy <I>&quot;A </B></I>Developing World:


Strategy for Danish Development <I>Policy towards the Year 2000.'


</I>The parliamentary debate that followed </B>demonstrated


broad political consensus on the strategy.


<P>


The present 5-year plan is thus the first after the adoption of


the strategy. The plan reflects the new initiatives that have


so far been initiated as a follow-up to the strategy.


<P>


<B>Poverty alleviation</B>


<P>


The fight against poverty is the fundamental principle underlying


Danish development assistance. This was emphasized in the new


development strategy. Efforts to realize the objective of poverty


alleviation will be continued, partly in connection with the preparation


of individual strategies for the development cooperation with


each of the programme countries and partly by updating existing


guidelines for the preparation, implementation and evaluation


of projects and programmes.


<P>


<B>Promotion of democracy and human rights</B>


<P>


The </B>promotion of respect </B>for human rights and democratization


has become an ever </B>increasing central and integrated </B>part


of </B>Danish aid policy cooperation with </B>the developing


</B>countries. The new </B>development strategy emphasizes


</B>this fact. </B>Increased respect for human rights is, of


course, an objective in itself. At the same time, respect for


human rights and broader popular participation in the development


process are instrumental in enhancing the development of sustainable


societies. The general development towards more democratic systems


of governance and respect for human rights in each country, therefore,


constitute an important prerequisite for the development cooperation.


Democratization, however, is both a difficult and a long-term


process, and progress in each country must be assessed over a


longer period of time.


<P>


<B>Support for indigenous peoples</B>


<P>


As an important part of the assistance given to promote respect


for human rights, particular emphasis will be placed on activities


in support of vulnerable groups, i.a. the indigenous peoples.


Assistance will be given partly to support the pursuit of political


objectives, partly towards concrete activities. In 1994 a specific


strategy was presented for Danish support for indigenous peoples.


<P>


<B>Environment and development</B>


<P>


It is stressed in the new development strategy that the connection


between environmervt and development, i.e. ensuring sustainable


development, must be incorporated into Danish poverty-oriented


assistance. This means, among other things, that environmental


impact assessments will be prepared in connection with all physical


activities implemented with Danish assistance. Furthermore, increased


priority will be given to efforts helping to augment the developing


countries' own capacity in this area. In an international context,


Denmark will continue to support the strengthening of environmental


cooperation both regionally and globally.


<P>


<B>Women and development</B>


<P>


The new strategy emphasizes the importance that will be attached


to incorporating women Into the development process. The objective


Is for gender issues to play a central and fully integrated role


in the development process. In the coming years, work on women


and development will be focused on the practical implementation


of Danida's new policy in this area: <I>Women in Development -


Danida's WID Policy towards the Year 2000, </I>which was presented


in 1993.


<P>


<B>Population policy</B>


<P>


In <I>&quot;A Developing World' </I>it is ascertained that Denmark


has provided considerable support through the years in the area


of population activities. Directly, via contributions to international


and multilateral organizations and indirectly, via the strong


focus on poverty-oriented assistance to, for example, health,


education and social infrastructure in bilateral development cooperation.


as </B>an element of the higher priority given to Denmark's


efforts within the area of population activities, it was decided


in 1994 to formulate a strategy for the Danish activities in this


area. The </B>point of </B>departure for the strategy was


activities aiming to strengthen the reproductive and sexual rights


of </B>the individual woman and couple to determine the number


of children they wish to have, </B>and to plan the </B>size


and composition of </B>their family themselves.


<P>


<B>Trade, debt and aid</B>


<P>


The new development strategy establishes the mutual interdependence


between aid, trade and debt. One of the objectives of Danish trade


policy is to contribute towards the dismantling of barriers discriminating


against commodities from the developing countries and barriers


that counteract a diversification of their production structures.


Equally it is an objective to work towards the gradual integration


of the developing countries into the multilateral trading system.


<P>


Most of the highly indebted middle-income countries, particularly


in Latin America, are working themselves out of their debt problems


and experiencing a new period of growth. There is growing international


recognition, however, that the poorest debtor countries, particularly


in Africa, need far-reaching assistance. Many of these countries


will never be able to repay their debts fully, let alone attain


economic growth at the same time. Denmark continuously applies


pressure to the effect that low-income countries in the most difficult


position ought to be eligible for debt reduction up to 80 percent


on the publicly guaranteed debt.


<P>


<B>Economic reforms and development</B>


<P>


In the course of the last 10 years a range of developing countries


have implemented far-reaching economic reforms. The reforms have


constituted a condition for support from the IMF and the World


Bank. In most countries the reforms have succeeded in arresting


the economic decline. Only in a few cases, however, have they


been able to create significant economic and social progress.


Denmark supports the implementation of the reforms and emphasizes


that the recipient countries must have the opportunity to take


responsibility. Denmark also focuses on the consequences of the


reforms for the poorest population groups. In accordance with


the resolution of the Danish Parliament on 22 March 1994, an independent


assessment of the IMF's and the World Bank's structural adjustment


programmes has been initiated. The report is anticipated by March


1995.


<P>


<B>Cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs)</B>


<P>


In December 1993 a working group consisting of Danida and a series


of Danish NGOs presented a now strategy for Danlda's cooperation


with the NGOS. This was subsequently incorporated Into the new


development strategy. The NGO strategy establishes that the private


development organizations (NGOS) play an important role in the


overall Danish effort to promote development. In future, the NGO


assistance will also be concentrated on that which the organizations


are good at, and where they have comparative advantages. The NGO


assistance neither can - nor should - evolve into a 'shadow' of


the official Danish development assistance.


<P>


The materialization of the recommendations in the new NGO strategy


will result in a substantial reorganization of Danida's cooperation


with the private organizations. Administrative procedures will


be rationalized to favour especially the small organizations,


and the dialogue on development strategies and choice of programme


countries will be strengthened. The reorganization, which has


already been initiated, will be completed in the course of 1995.


<P>


<B>Cooperation with the Danish private business sector</B>


<P>


Danish companies are an important part of the resource base on


which the development cooperation is based. As a result of the


collaboration in the Special Liaison Committee on Industrial Development


in the Developing Countries, the Government in October 1993 presented


a <I>'Strategy for the Involvement of the Danisl7 Private Sector


in Bilateral Development Assistance.&quot; </I>With this strategy,


which has since been incorporated into <I>&quot;A Developing World,


</I>steps have been taken to involve the private sector more closely


both in the planning and implementation of the bilateral assistance.


It also entails increased commitment on the part of individual


companies in close collaboration with Danida and the recipient


countries.


<P>


The Danish business sector can contribute in various ways to solving


the development problems in the programme countries: through deliveries


of equipment, goods and advisory services. The aim has also been,


however, to focus on the Danish business sector's overall possibilities


for winning market shares in the developing countries, and not


just to look at its share of the Danish aid volume.


<P>


<B>2. The Volume of Danish Assistance</B>


<P>


The Government plans to maintain the development assistance at


one percent of GNP during the next five years. On that basis the


assistance in 1995 is expected to amount to DKK 9,734 million,


increasing to DKK 11,276 million by 1999.


<P>


The principle of a more or less even distribution between bilateral


and multilateral assistance was confirmed in the new strategy.


It is also reflected in the distribution of the assistance between


bilateral and multilateral activities during the present planning


period.


<P>


<B>3. Bilateral Development Assistance</B>


<P>


<B>A: Programme countries</B>


<P>


The new development strategy establishes that in future the official


bilateral development assistance is to be concentrated on the


20 programme countries which were reached in July 1994 with the


selection of Bolivia and Niger. Furthermore, it was decided in


July 1994 that Ethiopia should be appointed a new programme country


in connection with the previous decision to phase out cooperation


with Thailand. The GNP per capita in Thailand now exceeds the


established limit above which Denmark cannot grant official development


assistance.


<P>


<B>Bangladesh</B>


<P>


Danish assistance to Bangladesh will be designed to assist the


moderately poor population groups in developing themselves out


of poverty. It will also aim to reduce the constant risk of relapses


into poverty, and to assist those in extreme poverty through mobilization


activities and targeted employment creation efforts. In connection


with the new strategy for the development cooperation with Bangladesh,


which is anticipated by early 1995, geographical concentration


of the assistance is under consideration. Sectoral concentration


is also foreseen. The sectors under consideration are water and


sanitation, river transport and agriculture. The indicative planning


figures for the bilateral development cooperation with Bangladesh


are DKK 180 million in 1995, increasing to DKK 250 million by


1 999.


<P>


<B>Benin</B>


<P>


The development cooperation with Benin emphasizes the extension


and consolidation of the system of democracy, as well as the promotion


of social and economic development within the framework of the


structural adjustment programme. <B>A </B>strategy for the development


cooperation with Benin is under preparation. It is expected by


the end of 1995. Likely sectors on which the future programme


will be concentrated are water, transport, electricity and agriculture.


The indicative planning figures for the bilateral development


cooperation with Benin are DKK 60 million in 1995, increasing


to DKK 75 million <B>by </B>1999.


<P>


<B>Bhutan</B>


<P>


In future, efforts will be made to concentrate the development


cooperation with Bhutan on sector programme assistance within


three areas: health, incl. water and sanitation (approx. 600/.


of the assistance); environmental planning and administration;


and the political and administrative reform process. The strategy


for the development cooperation with Bhutan is expected to be


revised in early 1996. The indicative planning figures for the


bilateral development cooperation with Bhutan are DKK 50 million


per year throughout the planning pe6od.


<P>


<B>Bolivia</B>


<P>


Bolivia was selected as a now programme country in July 1994.


It is expected that a strategy for the development cooperation


with Bolivia will be ready before the end of 1995. The possibilities


for development cooperation are explored within the following


three areas: efficiency improvements and democratization of the


public sector; support for the integration of the indigenous Indian


population into the development process; and development of the


rural areas and agriculture. The indicative planning figures for


the bilateral development cooperation with Bolivia are DKK 25


million in 1995, increasing to DKK 1 1 0 million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Burkina Faso</B>


<P>


A strategy for the development cooperation with Burkina Faso will


be presented in the course of 1995. It is expected that the assistance


will be concentrated within the following areas: energy, water


supply, health, agriculture and support in strengthening the democratization


process. The indicative planning figures for the bilateral development


cooperation with Burkina Faso are DKK I 10 million in 1995, increasing


to DKK 175 million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Egypt</B>


<P>


The Danish assistance will be aimed at the poor population groups


in Upper Egypt as well as the modern sector of the economy. A


revised strategy for the development cooperation with Egypt is


expected in the course of 1995. The poverty-oriented activities


within the sectors of drinking water, sanitation, health, small-scale


industry and improvements to the environment will be continued


in Upper Egypt. There will also be activities within the energy


sector and in the area of the environment. The indicative planning


figures for the bilateral development cooperation with Egypt are


DKK 190 million in 1995, increasing to DKK 225 million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Eritrea</B>


<P>


A strategy for the development cooperation with Eritrea is expected


in 1995. Denmark, for its part, will seek to concentrate the assistance


on a few priority sectors in which the emphasis will be placed


on sector programme assistance. The possibilities for Danish assistance


within education and agriculture are under consideration. The


indicative planning figures for the bilateral development cooperation


with Eritrea are DKK 20 million in 1995, increasing to DKK 75


million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Ghana</B>


<P>


The strategy for the development cooperation with Ghana will be


revised during 1995. The possibilities for more concentrated development


cooperation are examined in the following sectors, among others:


water supply, health, transportation, environmental protection


and agriculture. At present the focus of the programme is a multi-pronged


approach to solving the poverty problems in the rural areas. The


indicative planning figures for the bilateral development cooperation


with Ghana are DKK 155 million in 1995, increasing to DKK 200


million <B>by </B>1999.


<P>


<B>India</B>


<P>


Based on the expectation that lndia's economy will continue to


experience considerable growth, Denmark has begun a reorganization


of the bilateral assistance. The reorganization entails scaling


down bilateral project assistance and phasing out programme cooperation


<I>per se </I>after 1997. The latter will occur over a number


of years to ensure the sustainability of the activities. In contrast,


increased support is expected via the facility for mixed credits,


the Private Sector Programme and the Industrialization Fund for


Developing Countries. The indicative planning figures for the


bilateral development cooperation with India are DKK 185 million


in 1995, decreasing to DKK 140 million by 1999,


<P>


<B>Kenya</B>


<P>


In connection with the reductions of recent years in the assistance


to Kenya, the Danish assistance has been focused on the following:


the health sector (gradual reorganization into sector programme


assistance); poverty-oriented and sustainable regional development


projects; improvements in food security through support to small


farmers and general support for the development of the rural areas;


and initiatives to fight corruption and improve public administration.


A strategy for the development cooperation with Kenya is expected


towards the end of 1995. The indicative planning figures for the


bilateral development cooperation with Kenya are DKK 130 million


in 1995, increasing to DKK 175 million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Mozambique</B>


<P>


A revision of the strategy for the development cooperation with


Mozambique was carried out in 1994. According to the new strategy,


the Danish assistance will be directed into three areas: activities


within small-scale and family agriculture as well as semi-industrial


fishery with a view to increasing the limited production capacity


of Mozambique; primary education and primary health care (the


latter in the Tete province) in order to increase access to basic


social services; and reconstruction of the economic infrastructure.


Finally, Danish assistance for the economic and social structural


adjustment programme is expected in the form of balance of payments


support. The indicative planning figures for the bilateral development


cooperation with Mozambique are DKK 165 million in 1995, increasing


to DKK 225 million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Nepal</B>


<P>


The aid cooperation with Nepal is in a phase of adjustment and


consolidation. This will entail a transition to actual sector


programme assistance as well as a concentration on fewer sectors.


A revision of the strategy for the development cooperation with


Nepal is expected by mid-1996. The most important areas of activity


are expected to be the following: animal husbandry (incl. dairies),


the education sector, environment and forestry, support for democratizabon


and specific activities related to women. The indicative planning


figures for the bilateral development cooperation with Nepal are


DKK 100 million in 1995, increasing to DKK 125 million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Nicaragua</B>


<P>


The aid cooperation with Nicaragua is focused particularly on


the following: improvements In the transport infrastructure, protection


of the environment and promotion of sustainable management of


natural resources, increased production possibilities for small-scale


agriculture, strengthening of the administration of local authorities,


and more rational administration of the medicine supply. A strategy


for the development cooperation with Nicaragua is expected in


the autumn of 1995. The indicative planning figures for the bilateral


development cooperation with Nicaragua are DKK 125 million in


1995 and 1999. The indicative planning figure for the three years


In between is DKK 120 million per year.


<P>


<B>Niger</B>


<P>


Niger was selected as a new programme country in July 1994. A


strategy for the development cooperation with Niger will be prepared


in the course of 1996. The development cooperation with this country


will therefore take shape in a gradual manner. A central theme


is expected to be natural resource management, with emphasis on


a sustainable strengthening of agricultural production. Access


to drinking water for people and animals is closely related to


this. In addition, general programme assistance and support for


the decentralization process seem to be suitable areas for Danish


support. The indicative planning figures for the bilateral development


cooperation with Niger are DKK 25 million in 1995, increasing


to DKK 75 million by 1999.


<P>


<B>Tanzania</B>


<P>


In the course of 1995 a revised strategy will be made for the


development cooperation with Tanzania. The strategy is intended


to result in a concentration of the assistance on fewer sectors.


Possible areas of priority include health and education as well


as selected productive sectors. The future emphasis will also


be shifted from project assistance to the development of sector


programme assistance. Furthermore, a number of the ongoing activities


will be continued, including an environmental programme, support


for road construction and telecommunications, and support for


the democratization process. The indicative planning figures for


the bilateral development cooperation with Tanzania are DKK 315


million in 1995 and DKK 300 million per year from 1996 to 1999.


<P>


<B>Uganda</B>


<P>


A now strategy for the development cooperation with Uganda is


expected early in 1995. Denmark will propose a continuation of


the cooperation within the areas of health, water, agriculture,


infrastructure, and support for the continued strengthening of


good governance and development of democracy. In future, the assistance


will be modified to take the shape primarily of sector programme


assistance. The indicative planning figures for the bilateral


development cooperation with Uganda are DKK 245 million in 1995


and DKK 250 million per year for the remainder of the planning


period.


<P>


<B>Vietnam</B>


<P>


in the spring of 1994 a new strategy for the development cooperation


with Vietnam was presented. The assistance will be concentrated


on the development of fishery; storage, transport and processing


of foodstuffs; and exploitation of the fresh water resources.


At the same time, the activities of the programme will be concentrated


on selected provinces, particularly in the central highlands,


but also in the northern and southern parts of the country. Furthermore,


support will be given to rehabilitation of two ferry crossings


on the Mekong River, to the financing of a master plan for the


cement sector and to the democratization process. The indicative


planning figures for the bilateral development cooperation with


Vietnam are DKK 95 million in 1995, increasing to DKK 250 million


by 1999.


<P>


<B>Zambia</B>


<P>


The main focus of the development cooperation with Zambia is to


contribute to the implementation of economic reforms with particular


emphasis on poverty alleviation. A strategy for the development


cooperation with Zambia will be finished by mid-1995. The assistance


is initially expected to be concentrated on sector programmes


within education and health. In addition, assistance may possibly


be given in the area of infrastructure, especially roads, bridges


and telecommunications. Until the programme is fully built up,


it will also include short-term efforts in the form of commodity


assistance and balance of payments support. The indicative planning


figures for the bilateral development cooperation with Zambia


are DKK 105 million in 1995, increasing to DKK 150 million by


I 999.


<P>


<B>Zimbabwe</B>


<P>


A now strategy for the development cooperation with Zimbabwe will


be finished early in 1995. The Danish assistance will be concentrated


on four main areas: agriculture, health (sector programme assistance),


development of the private sector and support for selected activities


within infrastructure (telecommunications and construction of


minor roads in the rural areas through labour-intensive methods).


The indicative planning figures for the bilateral development


cooperation with Zimbabwe are DKK 115 million in 1995, increasing


<B>to DKK </B>150 million <B>by </B>1999.


<P>


<B>B: Transitional assistance and country programmes to be phased


out:</B>


<P>


 At present, there are eight programmes of transitional assistance


of different size and duration: <I>Albania </I>DKK 45 million


over 3 years, initiated in late 1994; <I>Angola </I>DKK 200 million


over <B>4 </B>years, shelved due to the civil war; <I>Cambodia


</I>DKK 345 million during the period 1992-97; <I>Gaza and the


West Bank </I>DKK 250 million over 2-4 years; <I>Kirgizstan </I>DKK


60 million during the period 1994-96; <I>Mongolia </I>DKK 175


million during the period 1991-97; and <I>Namibia </I>DKK 200


million during 1990-95.


<P>


In addition to the above, there is a large programme of transitional


assistance to <I>South Africa. On </I>1 January 1994 a 5-year


transitional assistance was launched to a total value of DKK 750


million. The transitional assistance is to support the endeavours


of the new majority to consolidate democracy and promote social


and economic development for the masses. The assistance will be


concentrated within four main areas, with the poorest part of


the population as the target group: democratization and violence


reduction, develoment of the rural areas, education, and private


enterprise and the creation of employment opportunities.


<P>


The assistance to other recipient countries will be phased out


in the course of the planning period.


<P>


<B>C: Mixed credits</B>


<P>


The now facility for mixed credits was established in 1993, and


the Mixed Credft Commiffee, which is vested with the authority


to allocate assistance, was created in 1994. This facility enables


support to be granted for interest payments on export credits


for financing of projects in developing countries. At present,


developing countries with a maximum GNP per capita of USD 2,160


are eligible. By the end of 1994 the project pipeline for this


facility was approximately DKK 1 billion. After a start-up period


(1995-96) the allocations for mixed credits are expected to amount


to approximately DKK 300 million per year.


<P>


<B>4. Regional Assistance</B>


<P>


The new development strategy sets the stage for a major reorganization


of the future Danish regional assistance. The idea is - in accordance


with the main thrust of the strategy - that regional assistance


is to be defined primarily as a special type of multilateral assistance,


concentrated on support to regional institutions and organizations.


Consequently, the bulk of the individual regional programmes will


be financed via the multilateral aid allocation. Regional programmes


are foreseen in Indochina, Central America, Southern Africa and


the Sudan-Sahel region.


<P>


As a rule, future Danida assistance to regional programmes will


be given only if:


<P>


- the assistance is granted directly to regional organizations


and institutions as general support and/or support for specific


activities (as with the fundsin-trust cooperation), 


<P>


- the organization or institution implements the project and is


responsible for


<P>


this.


<P>


This, however, does not exclude the possibility of a certain degree


of official bilateral development cooperation in the form of regional


activities. During the planning period, funds have been set aside


for this in Indochina, Central America and Southern Africa.


<P>


<B>5. Multilateral Assistance</B>


<P>


Approximately half of Denmark's development assistance is given


in the form of multilateral assistance, i.e. through international


organizations, primarily through the organizations within the


UN system, the World Bank and the regional development banks,


and through the European Union (EU). <I>'A Developing World' </I>suggests


a more active policy in the area of multilateral assistance under


the heading: 'active multilateralism.' The idea is, for example,


that in future the multilateral assistance is to be distributed


to a greater extent in accordance with Danish aid policy priorities


and on the basis of the type of activity and efficiency of the


individual organization. The endeavour to materialize the 'active


multilateralism' will be initiated in earnest in 1995 - and this


will be reflected in the next 5-year plan for the period 1996-2000.


<P>


With the submission of the new strategy in the Danish Parliament


in March 1994, however, an initiative has already been taken to


establish the &quot;International Humanftarian Response Capacity',


which was formally launched in November 1994.


<P>


<B>A: The UN organizations</B>


<P>


The Danish assistance through the United Nations system is quite


substantial, both in absolute and relative terms. The discussions


about a financial reform of the UN's aid activities have been


continued in 1994 and are expected to result in concrete proposals


by mid-1995. Denmark will continue to endeavour to promote the


Nordic ideas about more solid and predictable financing of the


organizations, which at the same time, will ensure more equal


burden sharing among the donors. Further developments in the reform


progress will weigh heavily in the deliberations on the size of


the future contributions to the UN organizations. General UN policy


concerns will naturally also weigh heavily. As far as the distribution


of contributions among the individual organizations is concerned,


this will depend on the assessment of the organizations' efficiency


and the extent to which their activities and policies are in agreement


with Danish aid policy principles.


<P>


<B>UNDP</B>


<P>


The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the central


body of the UN for the financing and preparation of technical


assistance. In 1994 the UNDP presented a new overall development


concept - &quot;sustainable human development&quot;. This concept


seeks to combine the objective of environmentally sound development


with a human-centred effort within capacity building in order


to alleviate poverty, create jobs and strengthen the status of


the weak groups in society. Denmark supports this initiative.


Meanwhile, Denmark has emphasized that the somewhat general character


of the concept must not result in the UNDP continuing to spread


its activities too wide. In 1994 Denmark was the thirdlargest


contributor to the UNDP (after the United States and Japan). The


UNDP is the single largest recipient of Danish development assistance.


The possibilities of establishing strategic funds will be examined.


<P>


<B>UNICEF</B>


<P>


The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) aims to assist the


developing countries in their efforts to improve living conditions


for women and children. UNICEF is normally regarded as one of


the most well functioning UN aid organizations. In recent years,


however, it has also become increasingly clear that UNICEF's approach


has certain weaknesses in a broader development perspective. The


most important factor in this respect is that the sustainability


of the organization's activities is generally not sufficient.


The size of Denmark's general contribution to UNICEF will depend


especially on the organization's will to pursue the recommendations


of the board of directors, inter alia in regard to the sustainability


of Ks activities. No major increases in the general contribution


to UNICEF are foreseen. The possibility of establishing strategic


funds within UNICEF will be examined, however.


<P>


<B>UNFPA</B>


<P>


The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) has


the leading role within the UN system in respect of promoting


understanding of the social, economic and environmental aspects


of national and international population problems. It is the general


opinion that UNFPA is well functioning and well managed. The ability


and will of the organization to launch activities within primary


health programmes and broad socioeconomic programmes will be decisive


when establishing the size of future Danish contributions.


<P>


<B>WHO</B>


<P>


Denmark supports six of the global programmes of the World Health


Organization (WHO): the programme concerning research on tropical


diseases (TDR), the programme concerning control of diarrhoea


diseases (CDD), the programme concerning human reproduction (HRP),


the extended programme of inoculation (EPI), the global AIDS programme


(GPA) and the programme for basic medical supplies (DAP). For


several years, Denmark has criticized the leadership of WHO for


its insufficient ability to prioritize tasks. A reform process


is now under way. During the coming 5-year period the funding


eligibility of the individual WHO programmes will be assessed


continuously on the basis of professional, strategic and administrative


parameters.


<P>


<B>WFP</B>


<P>


The World Food Programme (WFP) aims to promote global food security


through the implementation of projects to improve social and economic


conditions in the developing countries. The projects are implemented


in the areas of food deliveries to vulnerable groups and food


aid in connection with catastrophe situations. Surveys indicate


that the demand for food aid will increase, but the supply is


expected to be constant. Consequently, the food aid has to be


made as efficient as possible. A recent evaluation of WFP concludes


that relief work in general is carried out with great efficiency,


while the results of the organization's development projects are


more difficult to establish. In 1994 this situation generated


a discussion which aims at a thorough revision of the overall


strategy of WFP.


<P>


<B>IFAD</B>


<P>


The International Fund for Agricultural Development (I FAD) aims


to provide loans on favourable terms in order to promote agricultural


development in the developing countries. Grant assistance is also


provided on a lesser scale. Generally speaking, IFAD is considered


an efficient organization, which usually presents projects of


high quality with a significant developmental effect for the poorest


population groups in the rural areas. At the same time, it is


relevant to mention that IFAD's poverty orientation is in line


with the Danish aid policy principles. <B>New </B>replenishment


negotiations are expected to be concluded in 1995.


<P>


<B>The Junior Professional Officer Programme</B>


<P>


Through the Danish Junior Professional Officer Programme, Danida


finances the employment of young, well educated Danes in international


organizations, especially the UN system, but also the EU and international


research institutions. In order to accommodate the need to strengthen


the Danish resource base, a minor increase in the number of junior


professional officers is expected within the coming 5-year period.


<P>


<B>B: The World Bank Group</B>


<P>


The World Bank Group consists of the World Bank (IBRD), the International


Development Association (IDA), which is the World Bank's fund


for concessional loans, and the International Finance Corporation


(IFC), which invests in - and arranges loans to - private companies


in the developing countries. Furthermore, in 1989 the Multilateral


Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was established. The World


Bank Group constitutes the most important channel for resource


transfers to a very large number of developing countries. Therefore,


it also plays a leading role in coordinating the activities of


the donor community in these countries. This is also due to the


role of the World Bank in connection with the implementation of


economic reforms. Generally speaking, the World Bank Group must


be considered an efficient institution. In recent years, its activities


have become much more poverty oriented, just as concern for the


environment and the role of women in the development process have


been accentuated. Denmark will continue to press the World Bank


Group to promote Danish aid policy objectives.


<P>


<B>The Regional Development Banks and Funds</B>


<P>


The regional development banks and funds provide loans to the


developing countries in the respective regions. The countries


which make up the respective regions have the majority of votes


in the regional banks, while the donor countries have considerably


more influence in the Funds. In the regional banks, Denmark strives


to promote the general Danish aid policy objectives, not least


the poverty orientation, as well as the inclusion of environmental


and gender aspects.


<P>


<B>C: The global environmental programmes</B>


<P>


An awareness has existed for decades that several environmental


problems affect such a large part of the world that ft is reasonable


to characterize them as global. As a follow-up to UNCED, a sub-strategy


for the Danish effort in relation to the global environmental


problems has been prepared and implemented. This effort is predominantly


financed from the multilateral allocation, but a smaller amount


also comes from the Special International Environment and Catastrophe


Facility.


<P>


<B>D: Funds-in-trust cooperation</B>


<P>


Funds-in-trust cooperation is project assistance implemented by


an international organization but financed by earmarked Danish


aid funds. h may be assistance to concrete activities, selected


on a case-by-case basis, or to sectors or programmes defined in


a long-term framework agreement with the organization in question.


In accordance with the new development strategy, the level of


the combined funds-in-trust cooperation is expected to be reduced


during the planning period. Changes may occur in the distribution


of funds to the individual organizations in order to concentrate


the assistance on organizations and sectors where experience has


proved positive, and where central Danish aid policy objectives


may be advanced.


<P>


<B>E: Humanitarian assistance</B>


<P>


The humanitarian assistance comprises the Danish contributions


to emergency relief - including catastrophe assistance per se


<I>- </I>and contributions to international refugee work. The


Danish humanitarian assistance is channelled mainly through international


relief organizations and private Danish relief organizations.


Internationally, recent years have been characterized by more,


larger and more complex catastrophe situations, while at the same


time humanitarian questions have occupied an ever more prominent


place in the consciousness of international public opinion. This


has had the effect internationally of more and more resources


having been allocated to emergency relief. The developments in


the Danish humanitarian assistance in recent years have reflected


the increasing demands internationally in the area of emergency


relief.


<P>


<B>The International Humanitarian Response Capacity</B>


<P>


With the submission to the Danish Parliament in March 1994 of


the new strategy for Danish development policy, it was decided


to establish an international humanitarian response capacity with


a view to strengthening civilian Danish efforts in crisis situations.


The International Humanitarian Response Capacity is to <B>be </B>in


charge <B>of </B>the deployment of Danish personnel, as a part


of the civilian elements of humanitarian, conflict-preventing


or peace-keeping operations anywhere in the world. The objective


is to contribute to endeavours <B>by </B>the recipient country


or the international community to prevent conflicts and thus contribute


towards maintaining peace and stability.


<P>


<B>F: EU</B>


<P>


The development cooperation within the European Union is growing


continuously, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The EU's


programme of development assistance comprises all kinds of development


assistance, including financial and technical assistance, support


for structural adjustment, food aid, catastrophe assistance and


support for development research. The assistance is managed by


the Commission (almost exclusively grant assistance) and by the


European Investment Bank (EIB loan assistance).


<P>


The focus of the EU's development assistance remains the cooperation


with the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (the


ACP countries) in accordance with the Lom6 Conventions. In addition


to this, the EU has substantial cooperation with the developing


countries in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean region.


Denmark emphasizes the need to strengthen the poverty orientation.


And Denmark makes an effort to ensure that the assistance to middle-income


countries is directed mainly towards the most vulnerable population


groups. The promotion of human rights and democratzation, the


environment and the role of women in the development process also


play an increasing role in the EU assistance.


<P>


The coming into force of the Maastricht Treaty introduced treaty


obligations in the development cooperation. The Maastricht Treaty


states that greater coherence is to be attained in the policies


of the European Union vis-a-vis third countries. This is an element


in the common policy on foreign affairs, security, economics and


development cooperation.


<P>


<B>6. Other Types of Assistance and Activities</B>


<P>


<B>Personnel Assistance</B>


<P>


The Implementation of bilateral aid programmes is supported by


personnel assistance comprising the deployment of advisers and


volunteers, as well as provision of stipends for the education


of personnel from the programme countries. The objective of the


new strategy for Danish development policy of securing the sustainability


of assistance through increased use of the developing countries'


own human resources implies a gradual re-organization of this


type of assistance. In future, an effort will be made to reduce


the number of long-term advisers deployed, in favour of greater


utilization of local resources supported by the deployment of


short-term advisers. The number of the latter is expected to be


increased. The effort to increase the proportion of women in the


personnel assistance will be continued.


<P>


Agreements have been reached concerning volunteer programmes with


the Danish Volunteer Service, Ibis, the Danish Missionary Council


and the Danish Youth Council, particularly in a number of African


countries. The programmes comprise more of the 'grass-root' type


of tasks, exchange between youth organizations and public information


work in Denmark. These activities are increasingly carried out


in collaboration with local organizations in the developing countries.


In connection with the traditional deployment of volunteers -


which is expected to decline - the emphasis is on strengthening


local partners in the collaboration.


<P>


The stipend programme has experienced continuous growth, particularly


within the area of local stipends, which are granted for studies


in the scholar's own country or region. This tendency is expected


to be increased in connection with the reorganization of the personnel


assistance after the adoption of the now strategy.


<P>


<B>Projects In Denmark</B>


<P>


The Danish Bilharziosis Laboratory, the Danish Forest Seed Centre


and the Danish Government Institute of Seed Pathology for the


Developing Countries are educational and research institutions.


The scope of these projects is directed towards the developing


countries. The support function of these projects vis-a-vis the


developing countries' own professionals and institutions is expected


to take on particular importance in the years ahead. This is the


case because the new strategy for Danish development policy aims


to increase the use of the developing countries' own human resources.


<P>


<B>Evaluation and Research</B>


<P>


The main purpose of Danida's evaluation activities is to control


and document the quality of the assistance, as well as to contribute


towards the improvement of Danish development assistance through


the collection, processing and presentation of experiences. Fifteen


evaluations will be carried out during the period 1994-97 within


the following areas: water, health, environment, education, infrastructure,


institution building, agriculture and research. Furthermore, six


sector evaluations will take place (fishery, cement, agro-industry,


transport, education and health), and four evaluations of different


types of development assistance (transitional assistance, private


sector support, mixed credits and NGO framework agreements). Finally,


five thematic evaluations will take place, among others: environmental


aspects, technology, aid administration, support for democratization


and the poverty reducing effects of the development assistance.


The Nepal programme will also be evaluated in 1995.


<P>


It is also expected in the coming period that support for development


research will be directed towards bilateral research assistance,


support for Danish development research and support for international


research activities, especially agricultural research. Furthermore,


an effort will be made to incorporate research components into


the ordinary bilateral development projects.


<P>


<B>Information and Cultural Activities</B>


<P>


The objective of the information activities is to ensure that


the development problems maintain an ongoing and natural position


in the information and educational activities undertaken by organizations,


institutions, schools, the massmedia and individuals. Support


is granted for information activities on the developing countries'


economic, social and cultural conditions, as well as the relationship


between the developing countries and the industrialized countries,


and Denmark's participation in the international development cooperation.


A major proportion of Danida's information activities in 1995


will relate to the two large UN conferences during the year: The


Social Summit in Copenhagen from 6 to 12 March and the UN's Fourth


World Conference on Women, which takes place in Beijing in September.


<P>


The cultural cooperation with the developing countries is handled


by the Committee for Cultural Cooperation with the Developing


Countries. This committee, which in recent years has experienced


a strong and growing interest in cultural cooperation, and thus


increased competition for the allocation, has intensified the


collaboration with the other Nordic countries. It will also seek


to extend the collaboration/coordination with the cultural projects


of the Danish embassies. In the coming years support for, among


others, literature projects in Africa is expected to be increased.

Development Co-operation Review of Ireland<br>Summary and Conclusions<p>

<i>OECD Development Assistance Committee</i><p></h3>

</center><p>

<hr>

<h4>This Report</h4>

The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.

<p>

The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.

<p>

This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 21 September 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.

<p>

<h4>Main Points</h4>

Until recently, some 60 per cent of Irish aid was contributions to United Nations agencies, the World Bank group, and the aid programme of the European Union. Over half of bilateral official development assistance (ODA) financed experts and volunteers set to a limited number of African countries. Irish aid was small in volume and declining as a per cent of gross national product (GNP), with the ODA/GNP ratio fluctuating between 0.28 per cent in 1986 and 0.16 per cent in 1992.

<p>

A watershed in the evolution of the aid programme was reached in 1993 when a "Programme for a Partnership Government" was adopted. This set out Irish government policy objectives in all areas, including overseas development. Based on this, a detailed four year Strategy Plan: "Irish Aid: Consolidation and Growth" was published in July 1993. The plan establishes an ODA volume target of 0.40 per cent of GNP to be reached by 1997, an increase in priority countries from four to six (all in Africa), increased funding for APSO (the volunteer-sending agency), stronger cooperation with NGO's through increased allocations for co-financing, the setting-up of an independent advisory body on aid issues, as well as the creation of an Irish Aid Advisory Committee to advise the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

<p>

By 1994, the results of the changes can already be seen. ODA volume increased in 1993 by 31 per cent in real terms to reach 0.20 per cent of GNP; the aid administration has been strengthened in numbers, new field offices have been opened, and systematic training is now being provided to staff; and the creation in 1994 under the aegis of the Irish Parliament's Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs, of a Sub-Committee for Development Cooperation.

<p>

The report goes on to provide information on the structure of the aid system in Ireland, its administration, management, evaluation, and effectiveness. Particular attention is paid to the technical cooperation programme, the role of non-governmental organisations, and a case study of Irish aid in Zambia.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Summary</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Preconditions of Danish Development Policy</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


In compliance with legislation on international development cooperation, the Minister for Development Cooperation submits an annual report to the Danish parliament, Folketing, on expenditure frameworks for development cooperation for the forthcoming five-year period. This report reflects the priorities set, on an ongoing basis, during the organization of Danish development assistance.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>The new development strategy: A Developing World</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





On 22 March 1994 the Government presented its new development strategy in the Danish parliament, A Developing World, Strategy for Danish Development Policy towards the Year 2000. The subsequent parliamentary debate showed broad political acceptance of the new strategy.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>The reduction of poverty</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The reduction of poverty constitutes a fundamental principle of Danish development cooperation. This principle is emphasized in the new development strategy. Efforts designed to concretize poverty reduction will continue at all levels - when framing bilateral strategies for development cooperation with programme countries, when updating existing guidelines for the preparation, implementation and evaluation of projects and programmes and when organizing active multilateralism.  These efforts will create the basis for reporting back to the Foreign Affairs Committee on the actual application of the poverty orientation principle in the current parliamentary year.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Promoting democratization and human rights</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


The promotion of democratization and respect for human rights have become increasingly central and integral elements of Danish development cooperation with the developing countries.  This is emphasized in the new development strategy. Improved respect for human rights is obviously a goal in itself. At the same time the observance of human rights and broader popular participation in the development process contribute to promoting the development of a sustainable society. Thus overall development towards more democratic forms of government and respect for human rights in individual countries constitute important preconditions for development cooperation. Democratization, however, is a difficult and long-term process.  Democratic development should therefore be evaluated over a longer time span in individual countries.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Support for indigenous peoples</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


As an important element of assistance designed to promote respect for human rights, particular emphasis will be placed on activities that support vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples, through support for political objectives and support for concrete activities. Follow-up on the strategy to support indigenous peoples is well advanced, at both bilateral and multilateral level.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Environment and development</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


The new development cooperation strategy stresses the relationship between environment and development. In other words, securing sustainable development will be integral to Danish poverty-oriented development assistance. Environmental impact analyses of all major, physical activities, initiated with Danish development assistance, is one way of achieving this objective. In addition, efforts which contribute to augmenting the developing countries' capacity in this respect will be given priority. In an international context Denmark will continue to contribute to strengthening environmental cooperation at regional and global level.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Women and development</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


The new strategy emphasizes the major importance attached to involving women in the development process. The objective is to give women-specific aspects a central and fully integral position in the development process. Activities in support of women's role in the development process will concentrate in the years ahead on the practical application of Danida's policy in this area: Women in Development - Danida's WID Policy towards the Year 2000, which was presented in 1993, as well as follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Population policy</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A strategy for Danish population policy was formulated in 1994, as an element of Denmark's upgraded initiatives in the area of population control. The basis of this strategy is support for activities aimed at strengthening the individual woman's and the individual couple's reproductive and sexual rights, to enable them to plan their own families in terms of number of children and birth intervals.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Commerce</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


The new development cooperation strategy establishes the reciprocal relationship between development assistance, commerce and debt. One objective of Danish trade policy - in terms of general trade policy, which is collective competence, and in relation to trade cooperation with AVS countries under the Lomé Convention - is to contribute to breaking down the barriers that discriminate against goods from the developing countries and that counteract diversification of their production structure, while at the same time working towards the gradual integration of the developing countries into the multilateral trade system.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Debt</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


While most highly indebted middle-income countries, especially in Latin America, are in the process of working their way out of their debt problems and are entering a new growth period, there is growing international recognition that the poorest debtor countries, particularly in Africa, are in need of extensive help.  Many of these countries will never be in a position to repay their debts in full, let alone implement economic growth simultaneously.  Denmark is pressing for additional debt remission for the most encumbered low-income countries.  The problems associated with multilateral debt have been discussed by the World Bank and IMF executive committees.  The World Bank presented an informal proposal for a multilateral debt remission fund in September.  Denmark has responded positively to this proposal, which is now under consideration.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Economic reform and development</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Over the past 15 years a number of developing countries have implemented extensive economic reforms. Economic reform is a precondition for support from the IMF and the World Bank. In most countries the reforms implemented were capable of stemming economic decline. However, only in a few instances did reforms lead to marked economic and social progress.  Denmark supports the implementation of reforms but emphasizes the need to recognize that these reforms, as an element of the development process, have made it difficult to achieve results in the short-term, particularly in the African context. To elaborate on this point it is Denmark's standpoint that the objective of economic reform must be the reduction of poverty and that economic growth strategies must be based on this principle.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the developing countries</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


In December 1993 a working group consisting of representatives of Danida and a number of Danish NGOs presented a new strategy for Danida-NGO cooperation. This was later incorporated into the new development policy strategy. The strategy recognises that voluntary organizations in the developing countries play an important role in overall Danish development assistance efforts. NGO assistance will continue to concentrate on the areas of expertise of individual organizations and on issues where they have a clear comparative advantage. NGO assistance cannot and must not degenerate into a "shadow" of national development assistance efforts.


<BR>


<BR>


The implementation of the new NGO strategy recommendations has resulted in large-scale restructuring of cooperation with voluntary organizations. This includes the introduction of biennial application rounds for NGOs seeking funds for individual projects. Standardized procedures have also been introduced, contributing to shorter case consideration periods and more uniform application processing procedures.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Cooperation with Danish business and industry</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Danish industry is an important element of the development cooperation resource base. To culminate the work of the Committee on Industrial Development in Developing Countries, the Government presented a Strategy for Danish Business and Industry's Involvement in Bilateral Development Cooperation in October 1993. This strategy, which has since been incorporated into A Developing World, enabled steps to be taken to enhance the involvement of Danish industry in the organization and implementation of bilateral development assistance. The strategy also contributed to the increased involvement of individual firms in close cooperation with Danida and the recipient countries.


<BR>


<BR>


The opportunities open to Danish business and industry for obtaining contracts relating to the implementation of multilateral activities are becoming more central themes in multilateral development assistance organization.

<B><FONT SIZE=3>Follow-up to the Social Summit</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


The World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 closed with the adoption of a policy declaration and programme of action. The Copenhagen Declaration consists of ten obligations aimed at more equitable social development, including a national obligation to formulate a poverty reduction strategy. Denmark will actively pursue the Declaration's obligations at multilateral and bilateral level.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Scope of Development Cooperation</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


In compliance with Government policy development assistance over the next five-year period will account for 1 per cent of GDP. On this basis development assistance in 1996 is expected to amount to DKK 10,189 million, rising to DKK 11,771 million by 2000.


<BR>


<BR>


The principle of approximate equal division between bilateral and multilateral development assistance is confirmed in the new strategy and reflected in the actual division of development assistance between multilateral and bilateral activities in the strategy period.

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>3.	Bilateral Development Cooperation</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


<B>A:	PROGRAMME COUNTRIES</B>


<BR>


The development cooperation strategy establishes that in future national bilateral development cooperation will concentrate on 20 programme countries. Malawi was selected as the 20th programme country in November 1995.


<BR>


<BR>











<B><FONT SIZE=3>Bangladesh</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Danish development cooperation with Bangladesh is designed to assist moderately poor social groups out of poverty, lessen the constant risk of relapse into poverty and assist the extremely poor through organized activities and targeted efforts to promote employment. The new bilateral strategy with Bangladesh, adopted in June 1995, states that from now on development cooperation with Bangladesh will be sector concentrated. The sectors selected are water and sanitation, river transport and agriculture. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Bangladesh is DKK 185 million in 1996, rising to DKK 275 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Benin</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Development cooperation with Benin stresses the development and consolidation of democratization and the promotion of social and economic development within the framework of the structural adjustment programme. A revised bilateral strategy with Benin is at the preparatory phase and is scheduled for completion in 1996. In future development cooperation is expected to concentrate on agriculture, water and energy as well as on support for the democratization process. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Benin is DKK 65 million in 1996, rising to DKK 85 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Bhutan</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A new bilateral development cooperation strategy with Bhutan is being prepared and is scheduled for completion during 1996.  Health and environment are among the sectors under consideration for the forthcoming strategy period. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Bhutan is DKK 50 million per year in the strategy period, rising to DKK 55 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Bolivia</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Bolivia was selected as a programme country in July 1994. A strategy for bilateral development cooperation is expected to be ready in 1996. Possibilities for cooperation are being investigated in the following three areas: agriculture and rural development, reform of the public sector and support for the integration of the indigenous population in the development process. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Bolivia is DKK 60 million in 1996, rising to DKK 110 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Burkina Faso</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A bilateral strategy for development cooperation with Burkina Faso is due for completion at the beginning of 1996. Development cooperation is expected to concentrate on the following sectors: water supply, agriculture and energy. In addition to initiatives in these sectors support will be given to the democratization process. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Burkina Faso is DKK 115 million in 1996, rising to DKK 180 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Egypt</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Danish bilateral development cooperation with Egypt will be directed at impoverished sections of the population in upper Egypt while at the same time concentrating on the modern sector. A revised bilateral development cooperation strategy was presented in 1995. The new strategy states that development cooperation - in continuation of ongoing programmes - will concentrate on three sectors: environment, renewable energy and energy saving, and water and sanitation in upper Egypt. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Egypt is DKK 200 million in 1995, rising to DKK 225 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Eritrea</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A bilateral strategy for development cooperation with Eritrea is scheduled for completion in 1996. Efforts are expected to concentrate on assistance to agricultural development and primary education. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Eritrea is DKK 30 million in 1996, rising to DKK 90 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Ghana</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


The bilateral strategy for development cooperation with Ghana will be revised during 1996. Possibilities for more concentrated development cooperation efforts are being investigated within the following areas: water supply, health care, environmental protection and agriculture. The main thrust of the programme at present is a multi-pronged approach to solving poverty problems in rural areas. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Ghana is DKK 170 million in 1996, rising to DKK 225 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>India</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


It was decided to continue bilateral development cooperation with India in spring 1995. A revised bilateral development cooperation strategy will be drawn up during 1996. The main objective of Danish development assistance to India will continue to be the reduction of poverty. Geographic and sectoral concentration are also important factors. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with India is DKK 185 million in 1996, rising to DKK 200 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Kenya</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Considering the cutbacks in development assistance to Kenya in recent years, Danish efforts will now focus on: health care, poverty-oriented regional development projects, improving food security through support to small farmers and support to rural development generally, and on initiatives designed to combat corruption and improve public administration.  A bilateral development cooperation strategy is expected to be completed in 1996. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Kenya - presupposing positive developments in terms of economic reform and progress in the political liberalization process - is DKK 130 million in 1996, rising to DKK 175 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Malawi</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Malawi was selected as a programme country in November 1995.  A bilateral development cooperation strategy is expected to be drawn up in 1996. Possibilities for initiating development cooperation efforts within water supply, health care, education, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure and telecommunications are being investigated. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Malawi is DKK 40 million in 1996, rising to DKK 150 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Mozambique</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A revised bilateral development cooperation strategy with Mozambique was presented in 1995. Under the terms of the new strategy Danish efforts will concentrate on five sectors: small holdings and family agriculture, semi-industrial fishing, primary education, primary health care services (concentrating on Tete province) and infrastructure, concentrating in particular on the electricity sector. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Mozambique is DKK 140 million in 1995, rising to DKK 250 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Nepal</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Development cooperation with Nepal has entered a restructuring and consolidation phase which will involve a transition to sector programme support proper and concentration on fewer sectors. A revised bilateral development cooperation strategy will be drawn up during 1996. Among the sectors under consideration are continued assistance to the education sector, the agricultural sector (natural resources administration) and the telecommunications sector. Support will also be granted to the democratization process. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Nepal is DKK 100 million in 1996, rising to DKK 140 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Nicaragua</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Development cooperation with Nicaragua in recent years has concentrated particularly on improving physical infrastructure, protecting the environment - including the promotion of sustainable exploitation of natural resources - broadening production possibilities for small-scale farming, strengthening local authority administration and more equitable administration of medicine. A bilateral strategy for development cooperation with Nicaragua is scheduled for completion in 1996. As a basis for forthcoming sector selection thorough analyses of the opportunities existing in a number of sectors have been initiated. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Nicaragua is DKK 120 million in 1996, rising to DKK 125 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Niger</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


Niger was selected as a programme country in July 1994. A bilateral cooperation strategy will be drawn up during 1996 which will lead to the gradual establishment of a development assistance programme. The administration of natural resources, with particular emphasis on the sustainable strengthening of agricultural production, is expected to be central to the strategy. Access to drinking water will be closely related to this process. In addition, general programme support and support to the decentralization process are obvious areas for Danish development assistance. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Niger is DKK 30 million in 1996, rising to DKK 80 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Tanzania</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A revised strategy for bilateral development cooperation with Tanzania will be presented early in 1996. It is expected that the strategy will concentrate efforts on fewer sectors, namely: health care, agriculture, roads and the development of the private sector. Assistance will also be granted to the democratization process. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Tanzania is DKK 300 million in 1996, rising to DKK 315 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Uganda</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A new bilateral development cooperation strategy with Uganda was drawn up in 1995. The strategy concentrates on four sectors: health care, water, agriculture and infrastructure.  Support will also be granted to programme anchorage, good governance and the promotion of democratization. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Uganda is DKK 250 million in 1996, rising to DKK 260 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Vietnam</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A bilateral development cooperation strategy with Vietnam was adopted in spring 1994. Development cooperation concentrates on developing the fishing industry, the storage, transport and processing of agricutural output and the exploitation of fresh water resources. Programme activities will also concentrate on selected provinces, especially in the central highlands but also in northern and southern regions. Modernization of ferry transport on the Mekong River will also be supported. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Vietnam is DKK 130 in 1996, rising to DKK 275 in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Zambia</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A bilateral development cooperation strategy with Zambia was drawn up in 1995. Efforts will concentrate on sector programmes within education and health care. Danida will also be involved on infrastructural projects - roads, bridges and telecommunications in particular. Support for the democratization process will also be an element of the strategy. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Zambia is DKK 100 million in 1996, rising to DKK 160 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Zimbabwe</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


A new bilateral development cooperation strategy with Zimbabwe was adopted in 1995. Danish development assistance will concentrate on four main areas: agriculture, health care (sector programme support), development of the private sector and support to selected projects within infrastructure. The indicative planning figure for bilateral development cooperation with Zimbabwe is DKK 120 million in 1996, rising to DKK 160 million in 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>B: TRANSITIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND PROJECT DISCONTINUATION</B>


<BR>


<BR>


Transitional development assistance initiatives are underway in Albania (1993-97), Cambodia (1992-98), Gaza/West Bank (1993-97), Kirghizia (1993-97), Mongolia (1992-97) and South Africa (1994-99).


<BR>


<BR>





Under the terms of the new development strategy transitional development assistance can be granted for the purposes of introducing comprehensive social restructuring typically in relation to the introduction of a political system based on popular participation, transition from a centrally controlled to a marketoriented economy, termination of war or reconstruction following a natural or human disaster. In future transitional development assistance will be granted primarily in the form of aid programmes implemented by multilateral or voluntrary organizations (NGOs). In addition to the above support may also be provided for the promotion of democratization, the supply of Danish goods and services, restructuring and modernization etc, administered in a manner that precludes the physical presence of Denmark.


<BR>


<BR>


In the forthcoming strategy period new transitional development assistance efforts are expected in Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia and Angola. It is envisaged that transitional development assistance to Gaza and the West Bank will be extended.


<BR>


<BR>


Development assistance to some other recipient countries will be phased out during the strategy period.


<BR>


<BR>


<B>C: HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIZATION</B>


<BR>


<BR>


The new development strategy affords the possibility of granting support to promote respect for human rights and democratization in countries other than programme countries. From 1996 onwards a global appropriation framework will be established whereby smaller scale human rights and democratization initiatives can be financed. Funds have been earmarked for human rights and democratization initiatives in Ethiopia and in Gaza and the West Bank.


<BR>


<BR>


<B>D: MIXED CREDITS SCHEME</B>


<BR>


<BR>


Regulations governing the mixed credits scheme were adopted in 1993 and a Parliamentary Select Committee on Mixed Credits, responsible for the allocation of funds, was established in 1994. Interest subsidy on export credits to finance projects in the developing countries is granted under this framework.  Support is granted under OECD consensus agreements on tied development assistance credits. Following an interim trial period (1995-96) it is expected that appropriations to mixed credits will amount to DKK 300 million per year.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=+1>4. Regional Development Cooperation</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


The new development cooperation policy provides for substantial restructuring of future Danish regional development assistance. The rationale is that regional development assistance - in compliance with the main objectives of the strategy - should in future be defined as special multilateral development assistance, concentrating on support to regional institutions and organizations.  As a consequence of this policy the greater part of individual regional programmes will in future be financed within the framework of multilateral development cooperation.


<BR>


<BR>


The regulations governing Danida's future involvement in regional programmes presuppose that:


<BR>


<BR>


* development assistance is granted directly to regional organizations/institutions in the form of general grants and/or support to concrete initiatives (as in the case of multi-bilateral development assistance)


<BR>


<BR>


* the organization/institution is project oriented and accountable


<BR>


<BR>





Danish regional development assistance encompasses the following regional programmes: southern Africa, Sudan-Sahel, southeast Asia, Central America and the Middle East.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=+1>5.	Multilateral Development Cooperation</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>


<B>A:	MULTILATERAL POLICY</B>


<BR>


<BR>


As a follow up to the new strategy on Danish development cooperation policy towards the year 2000, an Action Programme for Active Multilateralism will be formulated in early 1996.  Active multilateralism will be based on maintaining Denmark's considerable multilateral involvement including the approximate equal division of development assistance between bilateral and multilateral development assistance. Denmark will attempt to influence and strengthen the international system, in compliance with Danish development cooperation policy objectives, through active multilateralism. Finally, to a greater extent than hitherto, Denmark will engage in a more active fund allocation policy.


<BR>


<BR>


<B><FONT SIZE=3>Activity division and coordination in the international development assistance system</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Activity division between organizations has traditionally been marred by lack of clarity and duplication. At present the World Bank is in the process of taking over a number of development projects, mainly from UN agencies. The background to this development is lack of efficiency on the part of these agencies, limited resources and the diffusion of available resources over a number of minor activities. As an element of active multilateralism, Denmark will promote the concentration of UN agency projects on their mandates and fields of strength.


<BR>


<BR>





The need to strengthen coordination is stressed in active multilateralism. The perspective of strengthened coordination at country specific level, with the recipient country as the driving force, seems quite promising.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Priority areas for Denmark's multilateral development cooperation</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





In the Action Programme for Active Multilateralism a number of political priorities for Denmark's multilateral development assistance will be established:


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Poverty reduction:</I> the adoption of the reduction of poverty as the central objective of development organizations' efforts, including in programme/project activities and in the geographic division of funds, will be encouraged.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Follow up to the Social Summit:</I> Denmark will build up support for an independent monitoring forum.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Debt relief:</I> Denmark will work to promote the completion and implementation of the World Bank's informal proposal on the relief/remission of multi-lateral debt in the most impoverished countries.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Strengthening women's influence and situation:</I> gender-specific aspects will be incorporated into multilateral organizations' development-related activities generally. In terms of following up the Fourth World Conference on Women particular emphasis will be placed on promoting sexual reproductive health and rights and on improving women's economic situation.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Environment and development:</I> follow-up activities to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) will continue and efforts to incorporate environmental issues into multilateral organizations' activities will be strengthened.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Population policy:</I> follow-up to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo will concentrate on multilateral efforts and initiatives in relation to United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Human rights, democratization and good governance:</I> Denmark will promote multilateral organizations' efforts in areas where individual organizations are particularly competent, particularly in relation to vulnerable population groups, while at the same time promoting the active participation of the population in development processes.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Capacity building:</I>  Denmark will contribute to further developing the World Bank's, United Nations Development Programme's (UNDPS) and UNICEF's comparative advantage in this area.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Bridging catastrophe assistance and development assistance:</I> there is a need for emergency aid organizations to take into account the more long term development aspects of their efforts.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Preventing catastrophes:</I> Denmark will be active in giving higher priority to preventing natural and man made disasters.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Greater administrative effectiveness in organizations:</I> Denmark is prepared to take the consequences of unacceptable administrative practices by reducing its contribution or, if necessary, by terminating membership of the organization in question.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Danish staff:</I> as an element of active multilateralism Denmark will increase its efforts to secure the employment of more Danes in multilateral organizations.


<BR>


<BR>


<I>


*	Supplying Danish goods and services:</I> multilateral organizations will be encouraged to include potential Danish suppliers in their purchasing procedures.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Monitoring the efforts of multilateral organizations</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





A more systematic monitoring system has been put into effect to evaluate the impact of multilateral organizations' activities in recipient countries. In future more emphasis will be placed on positive cooperation in terms of donor coordination at country specific level and in relation to framing these organizations' multilateral programmes and strategies.


<BR>


<BR>





Furthermore, from now on a number of quantitative and qualitative indicators of multilateral organizations' effectiveness will be taken into account when considering efforts in Danish priority areas, etc.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Application of active multilateralism</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Considerable emphasis will be placed on building alliances with similarly disposed donors and recipient countries.


<BR>


<BR>





In addition attempts will be made to strengthen political and technical dialogue through more direct contact with management and staff - possibly in the form of annual negotiations corresponding to annual bilateral negotiations.


<BR>


<BR>





Funding policies - i.e. major changes in funding, earmarking funds, trust funds - will be employed to a greater extent than hitherto.


<BR>


<BR>





Finally, efforts will be made to create better interaction between multilateral and bilateral development assistance.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Determining contributions to multilateral organizations in 1996</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The Action Programme for Active Multilateralism will be presented at the beginning of 1996. In cases where contributions are not already determined by international agreements, concrete decisions on contributions to multilateral organizations in 1996 will not be taken until this programme is adopted.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>B: THE UN SYSTEM</B>


<BR>


<B>UNDP</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the UN central organ for financing and coordinating technical development assistance. The UNDP's overall principles are perfectly in keeping with the objectives of Denmark's development assistance policy. Over the decades UNDP has become involved in a multiplicity of areas. This has resulted in the inexpedient dissipation of UNDP's scarce resources. Together with India, Sweden and the UK, Denmark is analysing the future role of the organization. Denmark is attempting to contribute to improving the organizations capacity with regard to monitoring and evaluating its regional activities. Denmark has also taken the initiative to encourage UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA to harmonize their budgets and accounting procedures. Denmark will be forced to reconsider its funding commitments if the timetable for presenting concrete proposals in this regard is not adhered to. In 1994 Denmark financed almost 10 per cent of UNDP's overall budget.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>UNICEF</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The objective of the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is to improve the living conditions of women and children in the developing countries. UNICEF is prominent as a central actor in poverty reduction. UNICEF is also strong in other areas   especially in terms of women's and children's rights   which are in perfect harmony with Danish development assistance principles. The organization is criticized, however, for spreading its activities too thinly over 140 recipient countries and for not ensuring the sustainability of these activities through support to capacity building in these countries. Denmark will support UNICEF's projects during 1996, including its capacity building projects. By earmarking a proportion of its contribution to UNICEF, Denmark will attempt to ensure that the organization gives higher priority to activities involved with reproductive health and rights, and the rights of children. In the area of administration, pressure will be placed on the secretariat to present the promised proposals on joint budgetary and accounting procedures for UNDP UNICEF and UNFPA during 1996. Failure to fulfil this commitment will have consequences for Denmark's contribution to the organization.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>UNFPA</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The objective of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is to promote population policy issues. UNFPA is generally regarded as a well-run organization. Denmark's cooperation with UNFPA has been enhanced immensely in recent years as a result of the higher priority given to population issues in Danish development cooperation policy. However, criticism of UNFPA's mounting administration expenses has been voiced. Denmark has proposed the re-organization of budgetary and accounting procedures, as noted above under UNDP and UNICEF.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>WHO</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The objective of the World Health Organization (WHO) is to achieve the best possible standard of health for all. In recent years the organization has been criticized for not fulfiling its role as a policy formulator in the area of health. WHO has also been criticized for lacking priorities and for administration and management problems. As a reaction to these criticisms WHO has initiated a reform process. The process is proceeding quite slowly however. In the light of these developments Denmark has decided to reduce the number of its joint WHO programmes from six to three in 1996. This will involve a contribution reduction of at least 50 per cent.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>WFP</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The objective of the World Food Programme (WFP) is to promote global food security through the implementation of projects designed to improve social and economic conditions in the developing countries, with the help of food supplies to exposed population groups and by granting food-aid to disaster areas. Over the decades WFP has become increasingly dominated by emergency aid activities, which have proved quite effective. However, this has resulted in a reduction of WFP's capacity and affected resource priorities for development projects.  There is a lack of long term activity planning and opportunities to adjust projects to local food needs are consequently dimished. A study of the relationship between emergency aid and development efforts within WFP is planned with a view to determining a balance in Denmark's cooperation with this organization.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>IFAD</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The objective of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is to grant loans on favourable terms to promote agricultural development in the developing countries.  A limited number of grants are also allocated. IFAD's activities are in keeping with Danish development cooperation policy objectives. IFAD is considered a well-administered organization.  In light of this positive evaluation Denmark's voluntary contribution to the IFAD will be raised.


<BR>


<BR>








<B><FONT SIZE=3>Junior Expert Programme</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Under the terms of the Junior Expert Programme Danida finances the employment of young, well-educated Danes with international agencies especially within the UN, the EU and international research institutes. To accommodate the need to strengthen the Danish resource base, efforts will be made to increase the number of junior experts.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>C: DEVELOPMENT BANKS</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The multilateral development banks encompass the World Bank and regional development banks for Africa, Asia and Latin America. These four bodies are based on a bank that grants loans on market terms and a fund that grants loans on a concessionary basis. Technical assistance is also granted.  The development banks are also empowered to grant loans and make investments in the private sector.


<BR>


<BR>





The regional development banks and the World Bank in particular play a central role in the developing countries. The World Bank Group is the most important channel for resource transfer to a large number of developing countries and plays a leading role in coordinating donor efforts in these countries. These functions are closely related to the World Bank's role in implementing economic reform. The World Bank also plays a dominant role in the formulation of new development strategies and policies.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>The World Bank Group</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Considering the World Bank's weighty financial and development policies it is crucial that Denmark secures an influence on the Bank's policies and future course of action. This can be accomplished through "formal" channels, through participation in the work of the executive and during funding negotiations, as well as through bilateral contacts. The Bank is generally receptive to donors' points of view.


<BR>


<BR>





The overall policy of the World Bank is in full accord with Danish development cooperation policy. However, the Bank is often criticized for not being poverty-oriented in the practical application of its development assistance programmes.  Criticism is levelled in particular at the implementation of the structural adjustment programmes, lack of environmental accountability and failure to incorporate women-specific aspects of development assistance policy.


<BR>


<BR>





Denmark will continue its efforts in encouraging the World Bank to live up to its policies and objectives. The possibilities of promoting the Bank's efforts within the area of good governance will also be examined.


<BR>


<BR>





Denmark will endeavour to guarantee the substantial re-funding of IDA-II and to ensure that those countries not wishing to participate in supplementary funding are excluded from commercial contracts and any influence on them.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>Regional development banks and funds</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Regional development banks and funds grant loans to developing countries in their respective regions. Countries in these regions have majority voting rights in regional banks but donor countries retain considerable influence over funds.  Denmark promotes the general development assistance objectives of the regional banks, including poverty orientation and the incorporation of environmental and women-specific aspects.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>The African Development Bank/Fund</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Insufficient control of loan policy and general management problems have resulted in a crisis within the African Bank, which could ultimately threathen its existence. Negotiations on capital funding have commenced but the donor community, including Denmark, has clearly indicated that no further funds will be allocated before a clear indication is given that serious efforts will be made to reverse this negative development.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>The Asian Development Bank/Fund</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The Asian Development Bank is normally considered the best run of the three regional banks. However, re-orientation in recent years towards greater emphasis on poverty reduction is progressing with difficulty.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>The Inter American Development Bank/Fund</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The Inter American Development Bank has been strengthened in recent years and now surpasses the World Bank in the volume of loans granted to the region. A new orientation towards increased emphasis on poverty reduction is also in progress here.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>The Nordic Development Fund</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The objective of the Nordic Development Fund is to co-finance projects of Nordic supplier interest with multilateral financial institutions on easy terms. The fund is well run and Denmark will support considerable re-funding when negotiations commence.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>D: GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMMES</B>


<BR>


<BR>





It has been acknowledged for decades that many environmental problems affect such large sections of the earth that they are now global in character. A sector strategy for Danish efforts in relation to global environmental problems has been drawn up and put into operation as a follow up to UNCED. These efforts are financed entirely by multilateral funds.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>E: MULTI-BILATERAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE</B>


<BR>


<BR>





Multi-bilateral development assistance is project development assistance executed by an international, inter-state organization but financed by earmarked Danish development assistance funds. Multi-bilateralism can involve development assistance to concrete activities selected individually or sectors or programmes defined in a multi annual framework agreement with the organization concerned. The extent of overall multi-bilateral development assistance is expected to decline during the strategy period, in compliance with the new development cooperation strategy objectives on this issue. Proportional changes in allocations to individual organizations may occur in an effort to concentrate support on those organizations and sectors where experience has proved positive and where the central objectives of Danish development cooperation can be promoted.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>F: HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE</B>


<BR>


<BR>





Recent years have seen an increase in the need for humanitarian assistance together with an expansion in the activities of humanitarian organizations' aimed at normalizing conditions once emergency situations have ended. Danish humanitarian assistance is channelled through international organizations and through Danish voluntary organizations (NGOs). Taking advantage of the experience gained from bilateral emergency aid activities is of great importance to the impact of Danish efforts in influencing multilateral organizations.


<BR>


<BR>





International assistance is granted primarily through the UN humanitarian agencies: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, WHO and UNDP. The UN has set up a Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) in recognition of the need to increase the effectiveness and improve the coordination of humanitarian assistance. The DHA has, however, experienced difficulties in fulfiling its mandate. Denmark is encouraging the DHA to be more focused in its efforts.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>International Humanitarian Capacity (IHB)</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





To coincide with the presentation of the new development cooperation policy in the Danish parliament in March 1994, it was decided to establish an International Humanitarian Capacity, with the aim of strengthening Denmark's civilian efforts in crisis situations. The Capacity has now been formed and deployment experiences to date have been positive and will create the basis for further development of IHB.


<BR>


<BR>





<B><FONT SIZE=3>International human rights organizations</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Denmark is supporting UN efforts in the area of human rights through support for the UN Human Rights Centre. Support is also granted to a number of voluntary international human rights organizations.


<BR>


<BR>





<B>G: EU</B>


<BR>


<BR>





The EU's development assistance programmes are a component part of the EU's overall external relations with the developing countries. Efforts to create coordination between the various policies are still at the inital stages. In the long-term, however, it does have potential strength, considering the EU's weight in global politics. Denmark considers it quite a challenge to influence this aspect of EU policy. With a view to making development cooperation more effective, steps have been taken to create a degree of coordination between EU policy and the various policies of member states. This also involves operational coordination at both country and sector level and enhanced cooperation with other donors. The above themes are expected to dominate the debate until 2000.


<BR>


<BR>





In wider activities to implement a joint foreign and security policy, whereby the overall objectives of the Community's dealing with third countries and regions will be established, EU development assistance could play an important role as a element of soft-security policy, especially in the context of preventive efforts.


<BR>


<BR>








<B><FONT SIZE=+1>6. Other Development Assistance Types and Activities</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>








<B><FONT SIZE=3>Personnel assistance</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The implentation of bilateral development assistance programmes is supported by personnel assistance. This involves posting advisers and volunteers and granting scholarships to personnel from programme countries. Denmark's new development cooperation strategy objective of ensuring the sustainability of development assistance, through the increased deployment of human resources in the developing countries, will involve a gradual restructuring of this type of development assistance. From now on the objective is to reduce the number of long-term posted advisers, who are expected to increase in number. Efforts to increase the number of women in advisory assistance will continue.


<BR>


<BR>





Together with such DANISH NGOs as the Danish Association for International Cooperation (MS), Ibis, The Danish Missionary Council (Dansk Missionsråd) and the Danish Youth Council (Dansk Ungdoms Fællesråd) agreements have been reached on voluntary programmes, especially in a number of African countries. These programmes involve grassroots-based projects, youth exchange and information and publicity activities in Denmark.


<BR>


<BR>





The scholarship programme has developed steadily especially in the area of local scholarships, granted for studies in a student's own country or region. This tendency is expected to continue in relation to the restructuring of personnel assistance, in accordance with the new development cooperation strategy.


<BR>


<BR>








<B><FONT SIZE=3>Projects in Denmark</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The Danish Bilharzia Laboratory (DBL) (Dansk Bilharzioselaboratorium), The Danish Forest Seed Centre (DFSC) (Skovfrøcentret) and the Danish Institute of Seed Pathology for the Developing Countries (FIU) (Frøpatologisk Institut for Udviklingslandene), are educational and research institutes. Projects at these centres are directed at the developing countries. The support function of the projects, in terms of the developing countries' own professionals and institutes, will be particularly meaningful in the years ahead in implementing the new development cooperation strategy objective of employing an increasing proportion of the developing countries' own human resources.


<BR>


<BR>








<B><FONT SIZE=3>Evaluation and research</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





The main objective of Danida's evaluation function is to control and document development assistance quality and contribute to improving Danish development assistance efforts by gathering data and assessing and publicising the results. In the forthcoming strategy period twelve project evaluations, seven thematic evaluations and two programme evaluations will be carried out.


<BR>


<BR>





It is expected that support for research in the developing countries in the forthcoming strategy period will be directed at incorporating research components into projects which have another main objective, at bilateral research assistance and at support for Danish research in the developing countries.


<BR>


<BR>








<B><FONT SIZE=3>Information and cultural activities</FONT></B>


<BR>


<BR>





Publicity activities in 1996 will concentrate in the main on the cultural festival Images of Africa, which will be mounted in conjunction with Copenhagen '96.


<BR>


<BR>





Cultural cooperation with the developing countries is administered by a committee whose function is to coordinate development assistance activities and cultural cooperation with the developing countries. A massive rise in interest in cultural cooperation has been experienced in recent years. This has increased pressure on appropriations. The Committee has therefore intensified cooperation with the other Nordic countries and will attempt to expand cooperation/coordination with cultural projects undertaken by Danish embassies. In the years ahead support for such projects as the promotion of literature projects in Africa is expected to increase.

Tehri: a dam too far?</title>
</head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#b1d0e7">
<h3>
Tehri: a dam too far?</h3>

<p>The Tehri Dam is being built on the edge of the Central

Himalayan Seismic Gap, 45 km from the epicentre of the 1991

earthquake.  The site was chosen in 1961 and when the original

design for the dam was approved in 1972 it was to withstand a

peak ground acceleration (PGA) - fast back and forth shaking -

of O.25 g.  It is now felt, however, that the likely PGA at

the Gap would be around 1.0 g for an earthquake of magnitude

of over 8 on the Richter scale.

<p>
The dam is being strenuously opposed by scientists and

environmentalists on several grounds.  The first is the

seismic danger.  Should an earthquake occur, the dam's 700

billion gallons of water would crash down river, submerging

the holy cities of Rishikesh and Haridwar within an hour.

<p>
Another concern is the relocation of the people to be

displaced by the dam.  Judging by an earlier experience, where

those displaced by dams are still waiting compensation, it

seems unlikely that the over 100,000 people affected by the

Tehri dam will fare any better.

<p>
Furthermore, N.D. Jayal, Director of Natural Resources at the

Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH),

who is at the forefront of the movement against the dam,

questions its cost effectiveness.  "With any project you have

to see what the return will be.  In this case, instead of an

increase, for every rupee being spent the return is only 0.56

rupees!"

<p>
Then there is the problem of siltation.  "When you think that

the dam will stop functioning after about 30 years because of

siltation, where is the justification for spending so much?"

<p>
Jayal edits a newsletter "Bhagirathi ki Pukar" (the voice of

the Bhagirathi - the river on which the Tehri dam is to be

built).  The issues dating back to July 1991, make depressing

reading.  Though armed with detailed information against the

dam, the response they have received from the government has

been indifferent at best.  The government remains unconvinced

that the dam should not be built.  According to Jayal, though

the government agreed to conduct a study, the study's findings

have been classified secret.

<p>
There are many reasons for the government to want to go ahead

with the dam.  An understandable one is that the country needs

power.  But the opponents of the dam feel that smaller, less

expensive, run-of-the-river projects would be better.  "These

will generate power continuously, unlike the large dam, which

can only do so in the peak hours."

<p>
A less understandable reason seems to be the amount of money

such a project generates.  "The real reason for the

government's keenness is the money involved in building it. 

Everyone involved stands to gain" says Jayal.

<p>
The agitation against the dam continues.  Sunderlal Bahaguna

first protested with a 45-day fast in 1992; he broke his fast

on the assurance of the Prime Minister that the project would

be reviewed. INTACH organized a workshop of eminent

seismologists in 1993; the participants unanimously agreed

that the dam had been dangerously under-designed.

<p>
Yet work on the dam started again in autumn 1994.  In the

spring of 1995, when Bahaguna and his supporters tried to stop

the work, they were arrested and taken to the plains. 

Bahaguna went on an indefinite fast demanding there be a

comprehensive review of the dam by independent experts, during

which time work on the dam be halted, and an enquiry be

conducted into the corruption within the project.  The

activist was able to break his fast after 49 days when the

Prime Minister agreed a review.

<p>
It would seem, though that the government is stalling again,

as nothing has happened since.  There does seem to be an

international consensus against large dams, and the recent

decision by the World Bank to withdraw its support from Arun

III in Nepal will hopefully find an echo with the government

of India.  Says Bahaguna: "When there is such a difference in

opinion, does it not make sense to review it.  After all we

are talking about the ecology of a whole region."<br>

<h2>Sale of New Zealand' commercial radio stations network opposed 
by Maoris</h2>

The sale of Radio New Zealand's network of 41 commercial radio stations to an international media consortium, New Zealand Radio Network, has come as something 
of a surprise.  The $89 million sale was quickly condemned by the opposition Alliance and Labour parties.  Maori groups, which have already halted the sale of the network 
in March, are also opposing the sale.  New Zealand Radio Network has promised new investment and development in the network. <p>


The deal gives control of the state-owned Radio Company Ltd to three partners: Wilson and Horton, Australian Provincial 
Newspapers Holdings, and Clear Channel Communications, of the United States.  All three have links to the Irish media magnate, Tony O'Reilly.<p>


Out in the cold are the other bidders, a British radio company, GWR, which already runs 12 New Zealand commercial radio stations and was widely considered a front-runner and TV3's Canadian owner, CanWest.  A fourth group initially interested, 
the Ohio-based Jacor, is believed not to have entered a bid.<p>

 
GWR, which had stitched together a last-minute arrangement with the Maori Development Corporation in an attempt to strengthen its appplication, had said it would pay a maximum of  85.8m dollars for the stations.  The corporation was said to 
have taken an interest of more than five per cent in the GWR bid, which was also supported by several institutions. <p>


Still complicating the sale are the Maori objectors led by the Maori Council and the Maori Congress.  They also include the Maori Women's Welfare League and the Wellington Maori Language Board.  Although their attempt to get a High Court 
injunction to stop the sale was unsuccessful,  Justice McGechan, in ruling on the injunction request, said he agreed with the group that the Crown had failed to meet its Treaty of Waitangi obligations to promote and protect the Maori language through broadcasting.  The objectors say they will appeal.<p>
 

The practical difficulties of broadcasting in Maori while retaining a sufficient audience 
to maintain commercial viability are enormous. The new owners may have to dedicate 
certain frequencies exclusively to Maori broadcasting if they are to address the need to 
encourage it and also to maintain an audience on their other stations.<p>


The successful consortium will control two Auckland stations, one of them part of the Newstalk ZB chain.  It will also control an advertising production studio and RNZ Sport.  Auckland has several independent radio stations and that 
mix alone should be enough to ensure competition.<p>

<a name="amazon"></a><br><hr>
<h3>Amazon roads</h3>

<p>Concern is growing over plans by the Brazilian Government to
build four major highways through the Amazon rainforest.

<p>One of these will extend the BR 364 highway through to the
Pacific.  Another would open up an allyear road to Venezuela and
the Caribbean coast.  Other schemes would involve paving more of
the transamazon highway and extending it to the south.

<p>All these plans are part of the socalled Amazon Charter, signed
by Brazilian President, Fernando Enrique Cardoso, and nine state
governors last April.  

<p>Farmers, ranchers, lumber merchants and regional governors
welcomed the Charter which would lead to huge savings in the
current export route via the Atlantic ports and the Panama Canal
to Pacific markets.  It would also bring hydro energy from
Venezuela to Manaus, provide an export route for southern soya
bean plantations and open up the Amazonas state to logging.

<p>But environmental campaigners are concerned that such
developments could repeat the ecological and social damage of
previous road schemes if they are not carried out with great
care.

<p>According to local Greenpeace campaigner, Anna Fanzeres, the
governor of the state of Amazonas, Amazino Mendes "has a lot at
stake.  He's been offering incentives to loggers from other
states to come to Amazonas, attracting mineral companies and
aiming at a massive export industry from Manaus."

<p>Greenpeace Brazil also points out that the proposed development
policy for the region is not compatible with the Biodiversity
Convention once it is signed by the Brazilian Government and sits
oddly with the Government's pilot programme to preserve tropical
forests, which receives funding support from the G7 countries.

<p>"Brazil has enough experience with negative impacts of large
scale development schemes in the region (hydro dams, roads,
mining, predatory logging) to know that pursuing this line of
development we are going to lose the immense biodiversity
reservoir that is Amazonia," said Anna Fanzeres.

<p>President Cardoso, in justifying the coasttocoast highway, said
that his aim was to balance economic and technological
development with respect for the environment.  This would involve
relocating Indians to 50 reservations, which it appears that
Germany has offered to finance.  Where the funds needed to build
these highways will come from remains unclear.


<a name="voice"></a><br><hr>

<h3>A voice for 
widows</h3>

<p>One positive outcome of the NGO Forum at the Fourth World Women's
Conference in Huarou, outside Beijing, in September, was the
birth of a new international initiative to promote the cause of
widows.

<p>This followed an international workshop which discussed the grave
implications of the low status  in law, religion, traditions and
society  of the millions of women who are widows. It dealt with
the causes and consequences of their extreme marginalization,
poverty and vulnerability for development and society as a whole.

<p>The meeting, which was supported by Planet 21, publishers of this
magazine, and the Swedish International Development Agency
(SIDA), heard widows speak eloquently of physical violence,
property grabbing and degrading mourning rites often involving
sexual activities. 

<p>It heard successful examples of widows organizations in South
Asia and Africa, and attention was drawn to ways in which the
Women's Convention (CEDAW) could be invoked to protect their
persons and property and encourage acknowledgement of their
economic contribution to the community. 

<p>The workshop drew on other national and regional Forum panels
which discussed aspects of widowhood and, for the first time,
discussed the treatment of widows in the context of international
human rights norms and treaties. Too often widows do not enjoy
fundamental human rights to life, shelter, food, health or
livelihood. They are forced to live in the shadows, easily
exploited, their children's future equally endangered.

<p>It was resolved that widows now need an international voice,
linking the many local groups which have recently sprung up,
through the development an international NGO. The name for this
is Empowering Widows in Development (EWD), and funding is being
sought from a consortium of donor agencies.

<p><i>All those interested in EWD should contact Margaret Owen at
36 Faroe Road, London W14 OEP, UK. Margaret Owen is the author
of a forthcoming book The World of Widows to be published this
year by Zed Books. Research for this has been provided by Planet
21 in collaboration with SIDA.</i>


<a name="rivers"></a><br><hr>

<h3>Sharing the 
rivers</h3>

<p>Water sharing between countries is destined to become one of the
most contentious international issues in the new millennium, as
demand grows along with agricultural and industrial development
and growing populations. Two rivers, the Mekong and the
Euphrates, are likely to attract special attention in 1996.

<p>The signing of the agreement for Cooperation in Sustainable
Development of the Mekong River Basin, last year, opens the way
for major dam and water diversion schemes, especially in Thailand
where the demand for water is growing by more than 12 per cent
a year. A report funded by UNDP advocates that six major dams
should be constructed on the Mekong's main stem.

<p>Of the other signatory states to the Mekong Agreement, Laos is
looking to develop major hydroelectric projects, while Vietnam
is seeking water both for irrigation and industrial needs.
Cambodia's concern is largely to maintain its fishing industry. 

<p>Critics of the scheme warn that it could threaten rare marine
species, reduce the supply of water into the Tonle Sap reservoir
in Cambodia, decrease downstream fertility, increase flooding and 
salt water incursions, and even threaten the delta itself as the
flow of silt is reduced.

<p><b>Turkey's plans</b>

<p>Other huge dams are planned in Turkey where the government's
gigantic water schemes could eventually reduce the flow of the
River Euphrates by between a third and a half.

<p>Writing in Middle East International, Hugh Pope says that
Turkey's determination to complete what will be the biggest
engineering feat in history will have major consequences on
downstream states. And a crisis is inevitable if no sense of co
operation can be fostered between the states of the Tigris
Euphrates basin, principally Turkey, Syria and Iraq. 

<p>Since April last year, the first stream of brown water has been
flowing down a concretelined canal from Turkey's gigantic
Southeast Anatolian Project (GAP) into the fields of the Harran
plain.  So far it is a mere 2 per cent of the flow of the
Euphrates.  But that is just the beginning.

<p>Turkey has promised that it does not plan to take full advantage
of the fact that it supplies 70 per cent of the waters of the
TigrisEuphrates basin.  The head of the GAP, Olcay Unver, says
he expects Turkey eventually to use about 11 cubic km of water,
or about a third of the previous annual 31 cubic km flow of the
Euphrates.  

<p>What will hurt the Arab states downstream is that until now
Turkey has made only superficial use of the water.  

<p>According to Nurit Kilot, Professor of Geography at Haifa
University in Israel, Syria and Iraq at present use far more than
Turkey, about 5 and 14 cubic km respectively.   However, all
three countries are currently planning irrigation and
hydroelectric projects that would consume 41 cubic kilometres,
about a third more than the total flow of the Euphrates alone.

<p>Of a current estimated cost of $20 billion, $12 billion has been
spent so far.  Three of the 22 dams have been completed,
including the centrepiece of the project, the massive 1.6km
wide, 169metrehigh Ataturk Dam.  Six other dams are under
construction, and work on two more will start this year.

<p>The case for cooperation on optimal use of this limited resource
is further sharpened by the fact that by the time the water
reaches Iraq, at least half will have been degraded by exposure
to agricultural salts and chemicals.  There is also the question
of wastage through seepage and evaporation.  Currently, the
figure for wastage is 10 per cent but it could rise to 20 per
cent by the time all the dams are finished.  

<p>If an allround agreement cannot be reached, dammedup lakes
totalling the size of more than two years' flow of the Nile will
eventually lie shrinking in the scorching Middle Eastern sun.<br>

<h3>Fishing limits</h3>

<p>The continuing growth in the world's population and a
corresponding rise in demand for fish threaten to push this
valuable source of protein out of reach for the nearly one
billion people  most of them poor  who rely on fish as a
principal source of animal protein, according to a new report
by Population Action International (PAI).

<p>According to the new study, Catching the Limit: Population and
the Decline of Fisheries, population growth will especially
strain the availability of fish in developing nations, where
more than 700 million people already cannot obtain sufficient
calories and nutrients to lead healthy and active lives.

<p>"At the moment, population growth is fuelling about twothirds
of the current growth in demand for fish," says Robert
Engelman, coauthor of the study and director of PAI's
Population and Environment Program.  "As population pressures
on this resource grow, fish prices will continue to climb,
further reducing consumption among the poor.  In the next
century, many species of fish will become luxuries only the
welltodo can afford."

<p>The global fish catch peaked in 1989 at 89 million metric
tonnes and has hovered at around 85 million tonnes since then. 
The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates that
nearly 70 per cent of the world's conventional fish species 
such as cod, hake and haddock  are already fished up to or
beyond sustainable limits.

<p>Sound conservation and management strategies are central to
ensuring the future health of the fisheries and the
sustainability of fish catches, according to the PAI study. 
Early stabilization of world population would ease all aspects
of managing the world's fisheries into the 21st century and
beyond.  In the area of fisheries management, experts
recommend that governments:

<p>     reduce the throwing away of unwanted fish by encouraging
     methods that discriminate between target and nontarget
     species;
     improve storage and distribution technologies to reduce
     postcatch losses;
     eliminate subsidies that support overcapacity in the
     fishing industry (the world's fishing fleet has doubled
     its size since 1970);
     protect coastal and other fishery habitats by controlling
     development and pollution.

<p>"The Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that 60
million  tonnes of fish is the maximum sustainable harvest of
wild fish that can be captured for human consumption," says
Engelman.  "The international community  and individual
nations  will have to work hard to ensure that we respect
what appear to be the natural limits to fish catches."

Saving the Albatross

<p>Concern is growing for the continued survival of more than 13
species of albatross and a number of other seabirds which
frequent the Southern Oceans and the Pacific.  The principle
cause of this decline is know to be bycatch resulting from
longline fisheries.  

<p>Recorded declines in albatross populations at breeding
colonies have alarmed the scientific community and a real
possibility exists for the extinction of one or more species
within the next few decades.  Many albatross are killed as
they are caught by the baits of longline tuna fishing boats
and drown.  Currently, an estimated 44,000 albatrosses are
killed each year from this alone (including an estimated 10
per cent of the world's Wandering Albatross).

<p>WWF is calling on the Southern Ocean tuna fishing nations and
the fishing industry to take measures that will dramatically
reduce albatross deaths as a matter of international priority. 
"There is almost no time left to save this magnificent
wanderer of the world's oceans." said Dr Ray Nias, Director of
Conservation at WWF Australia.  This organization recently
completed a project to track the endangered Wandering
Albatross and discovered that it achieves voyages of over 1000
kilometres each day over open water.

<p>Work to develop bycatch mitigation devices, such as tori
poles (streamers that scare birds from the sinking baits) and
nightsetting is being carried out with some success.  The use
of such methods, and others such a closing off areas around
breeding colonies, will be essential if the extinction of the
albatross is to be avoided.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Swiss Development Cooperation</h3>



Official Swiss development cooperation started in the early 1960s, based on a strong voluntary and

charitable tradition and on Switzerland's role as an international humanitarian intermediary. Public support

for development cooperation has always been active, as can be judged from the population's high financial

contributions and active political participation. Although attention was rather focused on emergencies and

disasters, there is a shift away from traditional development issues to international environmental problems,

economic interdependence and consequences of consumption and production patterns of Northern countries

for the South. Government and NGOs are very active in development education, and their information

activities underline their very independent position. For instance, the accession of Switzerland in 1992 to the

Bretton Woods institutions is not only acclaimed in official documents, but also critically followed with

regard to the institution's internal functioning and their role in poverty alleviation. 

<p> 

Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 1 139 million, or 0.46 per cent of GNP, including

Switzerland's first year's contributions to the IMF and World Bank. Since the 1980s, ODA grew

considerably (in 1987 0.27 per cent of GNP). However, the target of 0.4 per cent of GNP, formulated in

1992 at UNCED, will not be reached in 2000. Due to economic constraints, the ODA budget for the period

1993 - 1996 will reach a level between 0.34 - 0.35 per cent of GNP. Over the years multilateral

contributions amounted to around one-third of ODA; in 1992 to 41 per cent. Since Switzerland's accession

to the Bretton Woods institutions, a permanent shift towards more multilateral cooperation is presently being

discussed. 

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Swiss development cooperation programmes are managed by two federal ministries. The Directorate for

Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid, known as the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC,

created in 1961) which comes under the competence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SDC is responsible

for technical cooperation, parts of the financial cooperation, and humanitarian assistance, amounting to 77

per cent of total Swiss aid in 1992. The Federal Office for Foreign Economic Affairs (OFAEE) in the

Ministry of Public Economy is responsible for a major part of financial support, amounting to around 20 per

cent of total Swiss aid in 1992. A small but growing fraction of the total aid (4.1 per cent in 1992) is

managed by the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Education and other ministries, and

2.0 per cent of total aid (in 1992) by the Municipalities and Cantons. Swiss emergency aid is managed by a

special Division of SDC, that takes autonomous decisions on the basis of a multiannual credit separately

from the cooperation budget voted by Parliament.

<p>

Implementation is done on the basis of subsidiarity: the Federal Government is not allowed to do things

which can be done by other institutions in Swiss society. Project preparation, implementation and evaluation

are mainly carried out by NGOs, consultants and enterprises, through various arrangements. Traditionally

the Government has a job-sharing relationship with the NGOs. SDC also directly finances international

NGOs and NGOs in developing countries. Specific aspects of the aid programme are implemented by other

ministries, for instance scholarships and the Global Environment Facility by the Ministry of the Interior. In

concentration countries the SDC has Coordination Offices for implementation. 

<p>

Both offices, the SDC and the OFAEE have a policy planning division. Consultants, NGOs and research

institutes are involved in policy planning. Allocations of responsibilities between the ministries, as well as

between the Government and outside groups (institutes, NGOs, enterprises) are finely tuned. These careful

processes of coordination may result in time consuming procedures. Two bodies that manage parts of the

financial aid and also have a coordinating function are the Export Risk Guarantee Commission and the

Board of the National Bank. 

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

Switzerland has a Consultative Commission on Development Cooperation for the SDC. One Sub-Committee

follows the implementation of the Debt Reduction Facility (created in 1991) and another Sub-Committee

follows Swiss policies in the Bretton Woods institutions. The Commission was established in 1976, when the

Federal Law on International Cooperation was accepted by Parliament. It is the Commission's task to advise

the Government on development cooperation policy, to scrutinise the objectives and priorities of

development cooperation, and to draw up recommendations on its own initiative. The Commission

contributes to the preparation of policy documents before final versions are written and sent to Parliament.

<p>

The Advisory Commission has 15 Members including Members of Parliament from all political parties,

representatives from the business-community, trade-unions, the research community, from one umbrella

NGO, and from other groups in Swiss society that have an interest in development cooperation. Members

are appointed by the Government for a four year period, with a maximum of four periods. The

Commission's secretariat is located at the Policy and Research Section of the Policy and Planning Division

of the SDC. The Head of the Policy and Research Section is the - part-time - Executive Secretary of the

Commission.

<p>

The Commission generally meets 4 times a year, unless specific issues warrant extra meetings. The agenda

is prepared by the Secretary in consultation with the Director General of SDC and the Chairman of the

Commission. The Chairman can draw up its own agenda and raise specific topics for discussion. Its mandate

allows the Commission to go beyond the policy areas of the SDC: it has right of initiatives, although

restricted. It can present its views to other ministries or the Government. The Sub-commission on the

Bretton Woods institutions meets around ten times a year. It is not known whether the Commission has its

own budget and information gathering activities. Presently the Commission prepares documents for the

coming UN Conference on Population and Development, the Social Summit, and the World Conference on

Women and Development. Documents are being prepared on world trade and the GATT. Each December

the Commission discusses the country reports of SDC and the various instruments of development

cooperation.

<p>

The results of the Commission's discussions are laid down in protocols for the officials of the ministries

concerned and for members of the Government. They are for internal use only and are very seldom

published. Beside this Commission, only one other coordinating body is known, the Committee on Foreign

Economic Policy which advises the Government on questions of trade and exports.

<p>

Parliament actively debates issues of development cooperation, although it appears to concentrate more on

general foreign policy matters than on specific topics of development cooperation. The long process of

decision making by consensus may generate a sense of superfluity of discussions in Parliament. 

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

Switzerland's many NGOs have a long standing and effective relationship with the Government for

implementation of projects and programmes. In the 1950s traditional Swiss NGOs, such as Helvetas,

Swisscontact, Swissaid and a number of Church-related NGOs, directed their attention from Europe to the

Third World. In later years many solidarity groups and voluntary sending organisations were founded. There

are around 165 development NGOs. Governmental NGO programmes are managed by the SDC. 

<p>

The SDC co-finances projects of individual NGOs (8.2 per cent of bilateral assistance in 1992), finances

their general costs, and contracts NGOs for SDC projects. In 1991 27.5 per cent of the total public and

private development assistance was received and spent by NGOs. There is only one umbrella-type NGO

organisation taking part in a formal policy dialogue with the Federal Government, the Swiss Aid Agencies

Coalition (representing five NGOs). The Coalition is also represented in the Consultative Commission and

its Sub-committees, and in the Consultative Committee on Foreign Economic Policy.

<p>

NGOs follow Swiss official development policy critically. They are often initiators of referenda on

development issues. One NGO campaigned, unsuccessfully, against Swiss membership of the World Bank.

In 1989, on the occasion of the 700th Anniversary of the Swiss Confederation, NGOs campaigned

successfully for reducing LDC debt to Switzerland. In 1991 the Parliament approved the establishment of a

Debt Reduction Facility, over and above the regular ODA budget. For three other issues relevant to the

South the required number of signatures for a referendum have been collected: the demand for a complete

halt to Swiss arms exports, the reduction of military expenditure and, third, the protection of bio-diversity

against scientific and commercial exploitation. NGOs opposed with success further budget cuts for 1992.

<p>

The many topics of policy dialogue with the Government include: larger NGO participation in government

commissions and delegations, additional funds for the increase in multilateral contributions and for the

growing costs of peacekeeping, evaluation of multilateral and of financial aid activities, World Bank policy

and poverty alleviation, and implementation of ecologically sustainable development in Switzerland as well.

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 24 institutes in Switzerland qualify as Development Research

and Training Institutes. In 1993, SDC and the Swiss National Research Foundation started a programme for

promotion of research on Development and Environment by joint institutions in the South and in

Switzerland. Together with the Swiss Academy of Sciences, SDC promotes research in developing

countries. Many researchers are involved in government programmes and activities.

<H3>New Internationalist Issue 278</H3>
<BR>
<I>The material that follows has been provided by <A HREF="../NIinfo.html">New
Internationalist</A></I> <BR>
<HR>
<H1>From this month's editor</H1>
<BR>
ONE of the great rewards of working here at the <i>New Internationalist</i> is
our editorial freedom. As an editor, once you've plumped for a particular
subject, you can pretty much go for it. There  are few jobs in the media
that offer this latitude. It's a challenge but also a real privilege to
be able to comb through the literature, talk to those more knowledgeable
than yourself and finally come to the conclusion that, yes, you're actually
beginning to make some sense out of what at first appeared to be an almost
impossibly complex subject. <BR>
<BR>
Mind you it's not always clear sailing: simply carving out the time to research
and read can be a battle. Running a publishing co-operative, as we do, means
editors are often pulled in four directions at the same time. Unlike the
mainstream media, all of us have to wear several hats at once and I'd be
the first to admit that some of them don't fit that well. <BR>
<BR>
Still, it's the 'intellectual buzz' that keeps us going. But once you've
absorbed all the facts and arguments and come up with some kind of consistent
analysis you're left with trying to make the magazine work in journalistic
terms. And that's another story. <BR>
<BR>
<br>

It helps to put ourselves in your shoes. Because we editors actually start
from pretty much the same position as our readers -  loaded with our
own quirky baggage of bias, scepticism and curiosity. That understanding
is really the foundation for building a successful magazine 'on-the-page'.
<BR>
Take this  issue on 'green economics'. <BR>
<BR>
When I first I read about  'appropriated carrying capacity', 'biophysical
limits to growth' and the tragic, perhaps irreversible destruction of the
earth's functioning ecosystems, I confess to feeling a tinge of despair.
Not unlike some readers, who tell us that the more they know about the world's
problems the more depressed they feel. <BR>
<BR>
But as I ploughed on and felt the energy and commitment of thousands of
people attempting to define an alternative economic future, that despair
faded. I began to realize that it's impossible to come up with a solution
until you fully understand the problem. <BR>
<BR>
So in this issue I've attempted to do both - to give a clear sense
of the down-side but also to point to the green path beyond. <BR>
<BR>
Because the path is there, though many more of us are needed to help build
it. As an old Zen saying would have it, there's lots more work to do: 'After
ecstasy, the laundry.'<BR>

Nieuwe Overeenkomst Inzake Universitaire Ontwikkelingssamenwerking (UOS)<P>door <I>Jo Bastiaens</I>

</h2>

<h4>Tekst van een artikel verschenen in <I>Universiteit & Beleid</I>, vol. 9, no. 4, 1995: pp. 35-43

<p></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

Op 12 mei jl. -nog voor de verkiezingen- gaf de Ministerraad van de Regering DEHAENE I zijn fiat aan een aantal opmerkelijke voorstellen van de toenmalige Minister voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, dhr. E. DERYCKE, met betrekking tot de vernieuwing van de universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Deze voorstellen betroffen enerzijds een ontwerp van Koninklijk Besluit betreffende de hervorming van het beurzenbeleid, en anderzijds twee nieuwe kaderovereenkomsten tussen de Belgische Staat en de Vlaamse resp. de Franstalige universiteiten die de krijt- en krachtlijnen van de UOS vastleggen voor de komende vijf jaar. De nieuwe overeenkomsten kwamen tot stand na voorafgaandelijk overleg met de VL.I.R. resp. met de CIUF. De overeenkomst met de Vlaamse universiteiten werd ondertekend op 18 mei jl., deze met de Franstalige universiteiten op 19 mei. 

<P>

<H4>1. Situering</H4>

<P>

Met de ondertekening van de nieuwe overeenkomsten wordt een voorlopig einde gesteld aan de impasse die de universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking sedert een aantal jaren kenmerkt. De vroegere 'Algemene Overeenkomst tussen de Belgische Staat en de Vlaamse universitaire instellingen betreffende hun samenwerking inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking' was immers formeel be&#235;indigd in december 1986, ofschoon zij tijdens de daarop volgende jaren met stilzwijgende instemming wel verder werd toegepast. Herhaalde pogingen om tot een vernieuwing van deze overeenkomst te komen liepen telkens spaak op de problematiek van de communautaire verdeling van de kredieten voor universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Uiteenlopende inhoudelijke visies in het Noorden en het Zuiden van het land omtrent de prioriteiten en klemtonen inzake UOS vormen evenwel mede de grondslag van dit twistpunt (zie verder).

<P>

Toenmalig Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, E. DERYCKE, bracht in 1994 het overleg met de VL.I.R. op gang betreffende de toekomst van de universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De VL.I.R. van zijn kant formuleerde in juli 1994 een 'Advies over de Toekomst van de UOS'  dat een omstandig overzicht biedt van de visie die de Vlaamse universiteiten aanhouden ten aanzien van het beleid inzake universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De VL.I.R. kreeg de gelegenheid zijn visie en idee&#235;n omtrent de UOS uiteen te zetten tijdens een gesprek met de Staatssecretaris op 8 november 1994. Tijdens dit gesprek werd afgesproken om het overleg omtrent de vernieuwing van de Overeenkomst terug op te starten. 

<P>

Tijdens het overleg werd tevens overeenstemming bereikt omtrent een aantal inhoudelijke krachtlijnen en basisprincipes met het oog op een modernisering van de UOS. Deze hadden o.m. betrekking op de politiek van institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire centra, de invoering van een systeem van programmafinanciering voor bepaalde onderdelen van de UOS, de financiering van buitenlandse studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden door ABOS, de modaliteiten van evaluatie en identificatie van samenwerkingsprogramma's, de geografische concentratie van de universitaire ontwikkelingsprojecten. In hetgeen volgt zullen we trachten samen te vatten hoe deze punten uiteindelijk geconcretiseerd werden in de nieuwe overeenkomst. Ook zullen we even stilstaan bij de voorstellen van de VL.I.R. omtrent de financi&#235;le invulling van dit kaderakkoord. Tenslotte bekijken we ook de wijze waarop de communautaire problematiek al dan niet werd aangepakt.

<P>

<H4>2. Modernisering van de UOS</H4>

<P>

De Overeenkomst bevat een aantal nieuwe elementen waarmee een modernisering wordt betracht van de UOS:

<P>

<I>a. Rol van de overheid resp. van de universiteiten</I>

<P>

De nieuwe Overeenkomst brengt belangrijke wijzigingen met zich mee voor wat betreft de respectievelijke rol en taakverdeling van de Overheid en de universiteiten op vlak van de organisatie van de UOS. Zo bepaalt het akkoord dat het ABOS de gouvernementele UOS zal afbouwen en in de plaats een grotere verantwoordelijkheid en initiatiefrecht zal toekennen aan de universiteiten. Projecten van UOS waarbij ABOS optreedt als opdrachtgever of uitvoerder, hetzij via onderaanneming, hetzij via Universitaire Technische Samenwerking (UTS), zullen in de loop van de overeenkomst worden vervangen door programma's die worden uitgevoerd in het kader van de zgn. indirecte UOS , d.w.z. activiteiten die tot stand komen op initiatief van de universiteiten. Reeds vanaf 1997 zullen de lopende UTS-projecten na het verstrijken van de duur van de interventie ofwel worden stopgezet, ofwel worden overgeheveld naar de indirecte samenwerking. Een specifieke ad-hoc Stuurgroep ABOS/VL.I.R. zal worden opgezet die dit proces dient te begeleiden. Een en ander impliceert alvast dat er ook in budgettair opzicht een herschikking zal plaatsvinden binnen de begroting UOS van de directe bilaterale samenwerking (ie. de post UTS) naar de indirecte UOS (zie hiervoor tabel 1).

<P>

Hoewel als gevolg van deze herschikking de -in deze sector traditionele- bevoogding door de overheid belooft te verminderen, dient er anderzijds op gewezen dat de overeenkomst ook voor de indirecte UOS de spelregels heeft gewijzigd. De Overeenkomst bepaalt namelijk dat de Vlaamse universiteiten zullen proberen hun activiteiten zo dicht mogelijk te laten aansluiten bij het beleid van de Belgische Regering. Hiertoe wordt een paritair samengestelde Stuurgroep opgezet die verantwoordelijk zal zijn voor de algemene co&#246;rdinatie, opvolging en eventuele bijsturing van de activiteiten van de indirecte UOS. Ook zal de Stuurgroep jaarlijks advies uitbrengen aangaande de verdeling van de budgettaire enveloppe van de indirecte UOS over de onderscheiden begrotingsposten. De Stuurgroep zal zich daarbij laten leiden door de indicatieve meerjarenprogrammatie die deel uitmaakt van de overeenkomst (zie verder). Het Voorzitterschap en het secretariaat van de Stuurgroep zullen worden waargenomen door de VL.I.R.

<P>

Verder voorziet de Overeenkomst in een nieuwe projectenformule van UOS die niet langer beantwoordt aan de traditionele vorm van indirecte samenwerking -waarbij de universiteiten zelf exclusief initiatiefnemer zijn van de samenwerking (cfr. het model van de 'eigen initiatieven')- doch die eerder gestoeld zal worden op basis van een geregeld overleg tussen de overheid en de vertegenwoordigers van de Vlaamse universiteiten. Hierbij gaat het meer in het bijzonder over de programma's van institutionele universitaire samenwerking overzee.

<P>

<I>b. Institutionele universitaire samenwerking met prioritaire centra overzee</I>

<P>

Deze nieuwe samenwerkingsvorm behelst het opzetten van duurzame samenwerkingsrelaties tussen de Vlaamse universiteiten en een aantal bevoorrechte partner-instellingen in de derde wereld -ook wel 'prioritaire centra genaamd'- met als doel bij te dragen tot de institutionele versterking en verbetering van het algehele functioneren van de lokale universitaire instellingen. Hierbij zal een bijzondere aandacht worden besteed aan de uitbouw en opwaardering van het universitair onderwijs van de derde cyclus ter plaatse, alsook aan het stimuleren van Zuid-Zuid samenwerkingsverbanden tussen verschillende universiteiten in de regio.

<P>

Naast de institutionele universitaire samenwerking, blijft ook de thans gangbare projectenformule van de 'Eigen Initiatieven' (zie elders in dit nummer) behouden, zij het dat deze op termijn sterk zou worden ingeperkt ten voordele van de institutionele concentratie. De Overeenkomst bepaalt in dit verband dat vanaf 1999 minstens 80% van de middelen voor projecten overzee zou worden voorbehouden voor de institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire centra. Voorts zal in het kader van de 'Eigen Initiatieven' ook een nieuwe mogelijkheid worden ingelast om kleinschalige samenwerkingsactiviteiten uit te voeren in de ontwikkelingslanden. 

<P>

<I>c. Geografische concentratie</I>

<P>

Inzake geografische concentratie, stipuleert de Overeenkomst dat de institutionele universitaire samenwerking uitsluitend georganiseerd kan worden in de concentratielanden en -regio's van het offici&#235;le Belgische ontwikkelingsbeleid. De VL.I.R. dient er bovendien naar te streven om minstens 50% van de budgettaire middelen aan te wenden voor samenwerkingsprogramma's in Sub-Sahara Afrika. Voor wat betreft de 'Eigen Initiatieven' zijn de geografische restricties anderzijds heel wat minder streng. Deze kunnen immers ook gesitueerd zijn in ontwikkelingslanden die niet behoren tot de concentratielanden van de Belgische ontwikkelingspolitiek. Ingeval evenwel projecten worden voorgesteld voor samenwerking met universiteiten in landen die behoren tot de zgn. 'Middle Income Countries' , dan dient een relatief zwaardere inbreng van de lokale partner-instelling te worden bedongen en dient het principe van kostendeling te worden toegepast.

<P>

<I>d. Programmafinanciering</I>

<P>

De Overeenkomst voorziet dat voor een gedeelte van de kredieten voor UOS -met name deze bestemd voor 'institutionele universitaire samenwerking overzee' (zie hierboven)- de organisatie van de samenwerking zou geschieden op basis van een programmafinanciering. Programmafinanciering betekent dat de Overheid, in overleg met de universiteiten en de VL.I.R., jaarlijks een algemeen programma vastlegt dat het algemeen inhoudelijk en sectorieel kader schept waarbinnen de universitaire samenwerkingsprojecten zich inschrijven. De concrete invulling en het beheer van deze activiteiten wordt evenwel overgelaten aan de VL.I.R. die daartoe ook zelf de beschikking krijgt over de nodige middelen. Vanzelfsprekend blijft er vanwege het ABOS toezicht bestaan op de aanwending van deze overheidsgelden.

<P>

<I>e. Evaluatie</I>

<P>

In zijn Advies van juli 1994 stelde de VL.I.R. dat "Het in het geheel niet te rechtvaardigen (is) dat de 'Eigen Initiatieven Overzee' niet op geregelde tijd ge&#235;valueerd worden." De VL.I.R. is van bij de aanvang vragende partij geweest voor meer systematische evaluaties van al de activiteiten inzake UOS, en dit vanuit het perspectief van de continue zorg voor de kwaliteit van de universitaire samenwerking.

<P>

De expliciete bepalingen betreffende de noodzaak van een regelmatige opvolging en evaluatie van de activiteiten in het kader van de UOS, alsook de toezegging om hiervoor de nodige middelen vrij te maken, blijven niettemin een belangwekkende nieuwigheid in het geheel van de ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De Overeenkomst voorziet dat de beoordeling van de projecten en programma's overzee op verschillende manieren tot stand kan komen:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>via een externe evaluatie: ABOS zal jaarlijks, op advies van de Stuurgroep minstens &#233;&#233;n externe evaluatie organiseren;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>via een gezamenlijke opvolgingszending VL.I.R./ABOS: per jaar zal minstens &#233;&#233;n dergelijke missie plaatsgrijpen;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>via een opvolgingszending georganiseerd door de VL.I.R.

</UL>



<I>f. Opleiding van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden</I>

<P>

De Overeenkomst voorziet striktere criteria voor de financiering van de opleidingskosten van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden aan de Belgische universiteiten, en kondigt een wijziging aan van het Koninklijk Besluit van 10 augustus 1981 dat deze betoelagingsvoorwaarden formeel regelt. De hervorming van het beleid terzake valt uiteen in een aantal onderscheiden luiken:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>algemeen wordt prioriteit verleend aan de opleiding ter plaatse, inzonderheid voor wat betreft de universitaire basisopleiding. De opleiding in Belgi&#235; van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden zal bovendien niet worden aangemoedigd indien in het land of de regio van de student de mogelijkheid tot de beoogde vorming aanwezig is, a fortiori indien deze opleiding geen ontwikkelingsrelevant karakter heeft;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>voor wat betreft de ABOS-bursalen, wordt een herziening aangekondigd van het gangbare beurzenstelsel. Hierbij zou o.m. in grotere mate voorzien worden in de mogelijkheid om naast de beurzen voor studies in Belgi&#235; ook lokale beurzen te voorzien, d.w.z. beurzen voor postgraduaat opleidingen in het land van herkomst, dan wel in de regio;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>de betoelagingscriteria voor de financiering van de opleidingskosten van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden worden op tweevoudige wijze verstrengd: enerzijds wordt de lijst van de landen van herkomst van financierbare studenten beperkt tot de concentratielanden, anderzijds wordt het niveau van de opleiding bij voorrang op de derde cyclus bepaald;

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>de financiering van de universitaire opleidingskosten van de ABOS-bursalen gebeurt ad 100%, terwijl de financiering van de opleidingskosten van de niet-ABOS-bursalen begrensd wordt, en in ieder geval geen re&#235;le groei mag kennen ten aanzien van het begrotingsjaar 1993.

</UL>



Voor de Vlaamse universiteiten verandert er in dit opzicht overigens weinig of niets, aangezien zij deze beleidsopties reeds sedert jaren onderschrijven en op vlak van de opleiding van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden reeds een selectief en ontwikkelingsge&#246;rienteerd onthaalbeleid voeren, bv. in het kader van de Internationale Cursussen- en stageprogramma's, maar ook in het raam van andere voortgezette academische opleidingen, doctoraatsopleidingen en specialisaties. 

<P>

<I>g. Andere aspecten met betrekking tot de UOS</I>

<P>

<UL>

<LI>de Overeenkomst voorziet een jaarlijkse toelage voor het secretariaat van de VL.I.R. die de uitvoering van de bijkomende taken inzake organisatie en co&#246;rdinatie van de activiteiten inzake UOS moet garanderen.

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>de participatie van de Vlaamse universiteiten aan de onderzoeksactiviteiten in het kader van de multilaterale samenwerking wordt als zodanig niet geregeld door de nieuwe Overeenkomst. W&#233;l wordt hierover een bijzondere overeenkomst in het vooruitzicht gesteld.

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>de VL.I.R. stelde in zijn Adviestekst van juli 1994 de institutionele versnippering van het landschap voor UOS in Vlaanderen aan de kaak. De tekst van de nieuwe Overeenkomst gaat slechts ten dele in op deze problematiek, met name voor wat betreft de VL.I.R. en het ABOS (UTS). Opvallend in dit verband is overigens dat bijna gelijktijdig met de ondertekening van de overeenkomsten met VL.I.R. resp. CIUF, ook met de VVOB (Vlaamse Vereniging voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking en technische Bijstand) en zijn Franstalige tegenhanger APEFE (Association pour la Promotion de l'Education et de la Formation &#224; l'Etranger) conventies werden afgesloten. De krachtlijnen hier zijn meer concentratie (geografisch, inhoudelijk, sectorieel), mogelijkheid tot zendingen van korte duur en een sterkere decentralisatie van verantwoordelijkheid. Het lijkt er alleszins op dat, althans wat Vlaanderen betreft, de vraag naar meer co&#246;rdinatie van het geheel van de UOS nog een tijd aan de orde zal blijven.

</UL>

<H4>3. Indicatief budgettair meerjarenprogramma</H4>

<P>

De nieuwe overeenkomst bepaalt dat "de VL.I.R. een budgettair plan zal voorleggen dat een weerspiegeling is van de klemtonen die de Vlaamse universiteiten voor de jaren 1996-2000 wensen te leggen wat betreft hun activiteiten inzake indirecte universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking". De overeenkomst wijst tevens het globaal budgettair kader aan waarop de VL.I.R. zich bij de opstelling van dit plan zou kunnen richten. Hierin komt de beleidsoptie tot uiting waarbij een geleidelijke transfert van middelen van de directe (ie. Universitaire Technische Samenwerking) naar de indirecte UOS zou worden nagestreefd.

<P>

In uitvoering van deze bepalingen, legde de Raad tijdens haar vergadering van 16 juni ll. een voorstel van budgettair meerjarenprogramma vast (zie tabel 1) dat enerzijds vertrekt van een projectie op basis van een aantal parameters uit de Overeenkomst, maar dat anderzijds ook uitgaat van een aantal bijkomende beleidsaccenten en ori&#235;ntaties die vanuit de VL.I.R. worden voorgesteld. Daarbij gaat het inzonderheid over de volgende krachtlijnen:

<P>

a. uitgaande van het VL.I.R.-basisprincipe volgens het welke het zwaartepunt van de kredieten voor UOS voor acties ter plaatse dient te worden voorbehouden, wordt voorgesteld om het totaalkrediet voor projecten overzee (Subtotaal 1.2.3) relatief sterk te laten toenemen, nl. van 50,4% naar 60,5% van de indirecte UOS.

<P>

b. wat betreft de opleidingsactiviteiten in Belgi&#235; (krediet ICP) wordt voorgesteld om, op grond van de algemene aanbevelingen van de ICP-evaluatiecommissie van september 1992 resp. november 1994, uitdrukking te geven aan de optie om het thans versnipperde aanbod aan ICP's te herorganiseren middels een interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming. In concreto wordt voorgesteld dat het betreffend krediet zou toelaten om een beperkt aantal interuniversitaire programma's uit te bouwen rond thematische zwaartepunten. De organisatie van ICP's in Vlaanderen zou tevens meer systematisch gekoppeld worden aan de institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire centra. Bij de projectie werd uitgegaan van 7 &#224; 8 dergelijke opleidingen aan een gemiddelde kostprijs van 10 MBF per jaar. Daarnaast zou het krediet kunnen worden aangewend voor specifieke en kortlopende stageprogramma's. De voorgestelde absolute daling van het ICP-krediet gedurende de overgangsjaren 1996 en 1997 is ingegeven door de vaststelling dat de betrokken post in de ABOS-begroting thans overgebudgetteerd wordt. Het totaal bedrag aan vastleggingen voor het jaar 1994 (meest recente gegevens beschikbaar) bedroeg 91,5 MBF daar waar in totaal 116 MBF in de begroting stond ingeschreven.

<P>

c. inzake het Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek (krediet BVO) wordt voorgesteld om dit onderzoek op termijn middels interuniversitaire zwaartepuntvorming rond een beperkt aantal prioritaire thema's te versterken. De Raad vindt dat het basisonderzoek omtrent de ontwikkelingsproblematiek in de individuele instellingen een voortdurende aandacht voor deze thematiek moet levendig houden, zij het dat dit bij voorkeur op een in Vlaanderen geco&#246;rdineerde wijze zou plaatsvinden, zodanig dat in deze een minimale kwalitatieve capaciteit kan ontstaan. In concreto, wordt voorgesteld dat het budget voor BVO geleidelijk zou toenemen van 16 MBF (1995) tot 35 MBF (2000).

<P>

Het VL.I.R.-voorstel van indicatief meerjarenprogramma werd op 29 juni voorgelegd aan Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, R. MOREELS. Vermits de Overeenkomst pas definitief van kracht wordt na de formele goedkeuring van het budgettair meerjarenplan door de Overheid, wordt thans met belangstelling uitgekeken naar de reactie van Staatssecretaris MOREELS. De VL.I.R. rekent er alvast op dat de nieuwe overeenkomst met de Belgische Staat ook door de nieuwe beleidsverantwoordelijke effectief zal worden uitgevoerd.

<P>

<H4>4. De communautaire problematiek</H4>

<P>

Universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking onderscheidt zich volgens de VL.I.R. van andere vormen van internationale wetenschappelijke samenwerking, doordat zij essentieel een dimensie van solidariteit insluit, die volop gericht moet zijn op de zelfontwikkeling van de betrokken landen. De Vlaamse universiteiten hebben er in het licht hiervan steeds voor geijverd dat de klemtoon van de UOS in de ontwikkelingslanden zelf moet liggen, en bijvoorbeeld niet op de basisopleiding in Belgi&#235; van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden. Deze optie werd ook steeds concreet gemaakt door een principi&#235;le voorkeur voor activiteiten ter plaatse -o.m. in het kader van de 'Eigen Initiatieven' of via institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire instellingen overzee- en door een selectief en ontwikkelingsge&#246;rienteerd onthaalbeleid ten aanzien van buitenlandse studenten in het kader van de zgn. Internationale Cursussen- en stageprogramma's (ICP's).

<P>

Hoewel een aantal van deze principes in de nieuwe overeenkomst met de Franstalige universiteiten (CIUF) eveneens -zij het schoorvoetend- werden opgenomen, kan niet ontkend worden dat deze visie in het Zuiden van het land vooralsnog op weinig steun kan rekenen . Overigens heeft de VL.I.R. aan de Franstalige universiteiten nooit het recht ontzegd om inzake UOS een andere visie te verdedigen en een ander beleid te voeren, maar vindt hij integendeel dat beide Gemeenschappen in de UOS hun eigen accenten zouden moeten kunnen leggen. W&#233;l betreurt de VL.I.R. stellig dat dit tot nog toe aanleiding heeft gegeven tot een communautaire scheeftrekking van middelen, mogelijkheden en kansen om bij de UOS betrokken te worden. Dit moge blijken uit de geglobaliseerde cijfergegevens terzake die volgens onze berekeningen nog steeds een substanti&#235;le Vlaamse achterstelling aan het licht brengen in de grootorde van 38% N - 62% F (zie tabel 2).

Hoewel niet alle experten worden tewerkgesteld in de universitaire sector, vertegenwoordigt deze -althans wat VVOB betreft- een relatief belangrijk aandeel in hun werking. Voor de VVOB wordt dit aandeel op 50% geraamd. Omdat vergelijkbare cijfergegevens niet beschikbaar zijn voor wat betreft de APEFE, worden in de tabel de totalen weergegeven van de resp. ABOS-toelagen.<p>

(2)	Uitgezonderd de niet opgesplitste kredieten.



<P>

Niet al de kredieten uit deze tabel ressorteren onder de bevoegdheid van de Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Een bijzondere plaats wordt immers ingenomen door de federale gelden (1,8 miljard BF in 1995) die ingevolge de financieringswet van de jongste staatshervorming (1989) aan de Gemeenschappen worden toegekend voor de financiering van buitenlandse studenten waarvan een groot gedeelte afkomstig is uit de ontwikkelingslanden. De communautaire verdeling van dit krediet, dat jaarlijks overigens nog verder toeneemt ingevolge een wettelijk vastgelegde indexering, werd 'versleuteld' (80N-20F) en 'vergrendeld' tot in 1999, vermoedelijk als onderdeel van het globale communautaire akkoord dat aan de Staatshervorming vooraf is gegaan. Het betreffende federale krediet staat thans ingeschreven op de Begrotingsdiensten van de Eerste Minister als 'Dotatie aan de Gemeenschappen'.

<P>

De bijzondere kredieten ten laste van de Begroting van de Eerste Minister voor de financiering van buitenlandse studenten behoren formeel niet tot het voorwerp van de nieuwe Overeenkomst. Niettemin stelt deze expliciet dat zij "op geen enkele wijze afbreuk doet aan het recht van de Vlaamse universiteiten om, met verwijzing naar de communautaire verdeelsleutels inzake Wetenschapsbeleid en Onderwijs, een evenwichtige verdeling te blijven eisen van de beschikbare middelen voor activiteiten in het kader van de ontwikkelingssamenwerking tussen de universiteiten van de beide Gemeenschappen".

<P>

De VL.I.R. stelt dat uiteindelijk alleen de communautarisering van de UOS volwaardig een einde kan maken aan de voortdurende, financi&#235;le discriminatie van de Vlamingen in deze sector. UOS sluit immers onmiddellijk aan bij het universitair onderwijs en onderzoek, die beide reeds gecommunautariseerde aangelegenheden zijn. Bovendien vertegenwoordigen financi&#235;le middelen in deze even zo veel kansen en mogelijkheden, vooral voor jongeren, om in internationaal verband activiteiten te ontplooien en ervaringen op te doen die gericht zijn op de ontwikkelingsproblematiek. De rechtvaardige verdeling van deze middelen, op grond van een bevolkings- of daaraan gerelateerd criterium, is dan ook voor de VL.I.R. een kwestie van rechtvaardigheid &#233;n van essentieel belang.

<p><hr><p>



<H4>The End of an Era</H4>

<I>"This is the last Convention as we have come to know them" (Commissioner Pinheiro, Joint Assembly, Dakar, February 1995).</I>

<p>

These words by the Commissioner for Development spell out the fears and the wishes of many people closely involved in the workings of the Lom&#233; Convention (First signed in 1975, the Lom&#233; Convention provides a package of aid and trade measures to seventy developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific -- the ACP). For some, the Convention no longer fulfils the expectations laid down twenty years ago. Others see a troubling shift in European policies and argue that defence of the preferences and support provided by Lom&#233; is crucial to their own development and survival.

<p>

In between these views, there is a growing middle ground of observers who recognise that while all is not well with the baby, there are plenty of reasons not to let it slip away with the bath water.

<p>

<H4>Loss of interest in Lom&#233;....</H4>

The clearly-observable decline in European interest for its ACP partners is a worrying trend for those people in ACP countries and Europe who really understand its significance. So, what are the origins of the problem? Europe's relations with the seventy ACP countries have been the victim of the profound geo-political and economic changes currently taking place in Europe and elsewhere. The end of the Cold War and the rapid development of a global market have increased the marginalisation of ACP countries. The collapse of the Soviet grip on Eastern Europe, moves towards European Political Union, the loosening of East-West rivalry and migratory pressures from the Mediterranean region have led to a fundamental re-assessment by the European Union (EU) of its external policies. These are still being devised and it is not yet clear where the ACP will stand in a new configuration of EU external relations in the run-up to the year 2000.

<p>

Most observers expect that the ACP will descend on the list of EU priority regions, as was revealed by the recent re-negotioation of the financial protocol during the Lom&#233; IV mid-term review. Few of the Member States were willing to even maintain their contributions to the European Development Fund (EDF) far less to increase them. Some fought for, and obtained, a reduction in their contributions. These difficult discussions reflect widely-held scepticism in Europe about the value of the 20 year old privileged Lom&#233; relationship and lack of enthusiasm for its continuation beyond the year 2000. 

<p>

Besides these factors, there is also a growing feeling that the very premises on which the Convention was created are no longer as important as they once were.

<p><ul>

<li>Dwindling sense of common interest. When the first Lom&#233; Convention was signed in 1975, there were strong historical ties and visible mutual interdependencies between the former colonies and the nine EEC member states. Since then, the raison d'etre of the special relationship is disappearing and the foundations for any new rationale have not yet been defined.

<p>

<li>Questionable impact. In recent years, the effectiveness of the Lom&#233; Convention has been seriously questioned. Despite there being very little hard evidence on the record of Lom&#233;, critics continue to argue that Lom&#233; is now part of the problem rather than the solution. In particular, they say that it perpetuates ACP dependence on the European Union, promotes paternalism and clientelism rather than partnership, and far from allowing the ACP a say in the use of development resources, the European Commission takes the lead in most decision-making and implementation. 

<p>

<li>Aid fatigue. Public opinion in Europe increasingly wonders why they should provide aid when their own societies confront major economic and social problems. Despite this however, recent opinion polls in EU Member States indicate that public opinion still favours development aid, as long as there is evidence that it is well-used and effective.

<p>

<li>Unclear role and place of EC development cooperation. After more than thirty years, a "European Community" development cooperation policy has gradually emerged with the Lom&#233; Convention as its centrepiece. However, although the Treaty of Maastricht incorporated articles on development cooperation, much of the momentum has been lost. There is growing confusion as to the roles that the EC should play in this area next to bilateral aid programmes of the Member States. Some Member States favour a reduced Community mandate and consequently put pressure on the Lom&#233; Convention. In these cases, the trend is towards a "re-nationalisation" of EC development cooperation. 

</ul><p>

<H4>....requires that ACP states prepare thoroughly for the future</H4>



With such a range of pressures on the Convention, ACP countries are determined not to adopt a "wait and see" attitude. Between now and 1998, there is time to come up with a new rationale for a Lom&#233; Convention. It should be a Convention that has been suitably adapted to the roles it is expected to play in today's world. If not, the ACP-EU partnership will further erode and it should be seriously considered whether ACP countries, in their growing diversity, have an interest in defending the current Lom&#233; arrangements.

<p>

Officials at both ends of the Lom&#233; relationship understand that the time is ripe to start a constructive debate. On the European side, the Commission presents its ideas in a Green Paper in November 1996. On the ACP side, the Committee of Ambassadors has begun a parallel reflection process to be ready in time for the ACP Heads of States and Governments Summit expected in October 1997. Joint fora, like the Joint Assembly and the EC Economic and Social Committee have also extended the debate. Elsewhere, there is an observable increase in the number of meetings, seminars, and research initiatives that are being organised. The tempo is rising.

<p>

All this activity should be very comforting. In some parts of the world however, in most ACP countries to be precise, these debates have just begun. This report, and the programme on which it is based, are designed to contribute to this slowly-awakening interest. From an ECDPM perspective, it is vital that the views of ACP stakeholders are articulated and integrated in the reflection process and the debate.

<p>

<H3><A HREF="../lome/postl_gb.htm">The ECDPM Initiative</A></H3>





In mid-1995, ECDPM began a programme of consultations and visits designed to both collect the views of ACP and other actors and to stimulate independent reflection in ACP countries. The overall aim was to promote constructive debates on the future of ACP-EU relations where the positions of the various ACP players could be expressed and given a hearing.

<p>

The first phase was to inform ACP people about the issues at stake in Europe, to collect their opinions on the future of ACP-EU relations, and to feed these opinions back into the European debate. Consultations were held in about 20 countries in all the ACP regions (see Annex 6). During the extensive information collection phase in ACP countries, discussions were held with governments, organisations representing private interests, non-governmental organisations, research centres, regional organisations, and EU delegations. 

<p>

Linkages were sought with European decision-makers and other groups who have a stake in this debate. Finally, a conference was organised in Maastricht in June 1996. The two streams of reflection (in the ACP and in Europe) were pooled at the June conference. The experience was very enriching for both. It gave the ACP side a feeling of how European thinking on the matter is evolving and it allowed the Europeans to grasp the realities of the field. It provided an excellent opportunity to contrast the views of ACP players with those in Europe.

<p>

Aside from general coordination of the initiative, ECDPM:

<ul>

<li>Informed ACP groups on the issues at stake. By collecting views and information from ACP ambassadors to the EU, through visits to the field, through a newsletter, and by disseminating articles on ACP-EU cooperation.

<p>

<li>Involved ACP groups in the thinking. By soliciting contributions to the debate in the form of research or position papers (see Annex 3), or other types of activities such as workshops.

<p>

<li>Linked with experts. Key figures from Europe and the ACP were consulted and researchers were invited to focus their research on issues relevant to future ACP-EU cooperation.

<p>



<li>Linked with European stakeholders. NGO's and private sector associations worked closely with ECDPM and efforts were made to reach the wider public via the Internet.

<p>



<li>Linked with decision-makers. EU institutions and Member States were kept informed on the progress and findings of the initiative.

<p>

<li>Pooled ideas from both sides. After the preparatory work in both the ACP and Europe, the two streams fed into a broader debate at the June conference.

</ul><p>



<H3>Echoes from the Field</H3>



At the end of the consultation period, the ECDPM team was left with two strong impressions. These are raised here, not with the expectation that this report can address them completely, but to stimulate further efforts by all who are involved in this debate.

<ul><p>

<li>Lack of awareness. Globally, the level of awareness of the Convention and what it has to offer is rather limited. Real understanding seems to be confined to a few officials in each country who are responsible for day to day management of resources provided through Lom&#233;. This lack of information and knowledge about ACP-EU relations can partly be attributed to a lack of openness in governments, to the complex nature of the Convention, and to inadequate information dissemination by the EU and its delegations. A major and concerted effort is needed to disseminate information on Lom&#233; beyond the offices of the National Authorising Officers (NAO) in each ACP state. It must especially be targeted towards the line ministries, and many private and non-governmental organisations where levels of awareness seem to be lowest

<p>



<li>Motivation to join the debate. ACP people frequently asked whether their inputs and ideas would make any difference, and whether the EU would actually pay any attention to the views from the field. This reasonable concern is difficult to answer. Certainly, European Commission staff and representatives of the Member States appear to be receptive and interested in a wide debate. The onus is on people in ACP countries to come with good ideas and practical proposals that convince the bureaucrats to pay attention.

<p>

Part of the problem may be that officials, in the past, have encountered a lack of interest in Lom&#233; in ACP countries (understandably, given the lack of information). They hardly expect the ACP countries themselves, and certainly not their non-official communities, to be sources of new ideas. Our consultations indicate however that there is a large and mostly unused reservoir of enthusiasm and interest waiting to be tapped. Most persons met, especially in the private sector and NGO community, sometimes also in Parliaments, are very interested and are eager to be involved. Some are committed to taking the debate further at their national level. In most cases, mobilising this enthusiasm just needs some concrete actions, some invitations to reflect and provide advice, a clear willingness to listen, and a commitment to opening the debate.

</ul><p>



<H3>This Report</H3>



This report draws on the entire consultation and discussion process. It represents literally hundreds of opinions, views, and experiences expressed by ACP and European actors. These came from formal interviews, informal discussions, research papers, animated debate in small groups, and even electronic mail. In the interests of readability, these are not individually attributed, but are incorporated in the main text. The aim is to succinctly present the issues, to give some insight into the debates, and to identify proposals that have emerged.

<p>

In all of these discussions, several major themes could be heard, striking an echo in the minds of most listeners. These "themes" provided a framework for discussions at the June conference and a structure for this report.

<p>

<A HREF = "pmr62_gb.htm">Chapter 2</a> looks at how common interests and rationales for EU support to ACP countries can be identified. The historical rationale has been eroded, the commercial relevance of ACP countries is not tangible enough and "solidarity" arguments seem fragile. How can an enlightened reciprocal interest be found or built to sustain long-term and balanced cooperation?

<p>

<A HREF = "pmr63_gb.htm">Chapter 3</a> explores options for continuing the ACP as a group. On this issue, attitudes are very ambiguous. Many question the coherence and relevance of the ACP group whilst fearing the loss of privileges associated to it. 

<p>

<A HREF = "pmr64_gb.htm">Chapter 4</a> looks at the types of trade arrangements that might be suited to the modern international trade environment. The trade regimes of Lom&#233;, both in terms of preferences and with regard to the protocols, do not seem in line with new trade liberalisation. Ways must be found to accommodate both the needs of ACP countries and the EU's obligations to the WTO.

<p>

<A HREF = "pmr65_gb.htm">Chapter 5</a> reviews ways in which the concept of "partnership" can be adjusted to reality. Partnership was indeed the most innovative and praised value of the Convention. It has also been rather disappointing in practice. How can this trend be reversed and partnership revitalised?

<p>

<A HREF = "pmr66_gb.htm">Chapter 6</a> considers how cooperation can be opened up to non-state actors such as the private sector and NGO's. In their view, the Lom&#233; Convention has for too long been between governments and it has proven neither efficient nor adapted to current redefinitions of the role of the State in development.

<p>

<A HREF = "pmr67_gb.htm">Chapter 7</a> reports on the search for ways to improve the overall management of cooperation. While the Lom&#233; Convention is extremely rich in terms of instruments, there is a widespread under-use of the opportunities it can offer.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Irish Development Cooperation</h3></a>



Ireland became independent in 1922 and joined the United Nations in 1955. Official

development cooperation started in 1973 and was built upon previous efforts of voluntary

and non-governmental organisations. Development cooperation is based upon the direct

contacts of Irish people living in Third World countries during British colonial rule, Irish

emigrants to a number of these countries, a strong and substantial Irish Roman Catholic

missionary tradition and (respect for) its anti-colonial stand during British rule. The high level

of resources raised by Irish NGOs is an indication of the significant public support for

development cooperation efforts of these organisations. In fact, NGO aid-activities still seem

more popular, and known, than the substantial government programme. 

<p>

Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 69 million, which was 0.16 per cent

of GNP, after a sharp decrease in 1987. The amount will increase by 0.05 per cent of GNP

each year until 1997. In 1992 42 per cent of total ODA was disbursed through the EU, and 17

per cent of ODA went to other multilateral channels. The Government decided to raise the

bilateral aid budget at a faster rate than multilateral aid in the coming years, so as to achieve

a situation where two thirds of its aid is bilateral.



<a name="ins"><hr><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>



Irish aid is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, under the political

responsibility of a Minister of State responsible for European Affairs and ODA. He reports

to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Contributions for the World Bank group are handled by the

Department of Finance, and food aid by the Department of Agriculture. Irish aid being for a

large part technical assistance, is mainly implemented by NGOs.

<p>

The Development Cooperation Division (DCD) of the Department of Foreign Affairs

coordinates Ireland's bilateral and multilateral development assistance programmes. It is

responsible for the administration of the bilateral programme, emergency aid (mostly through

NGOs), participation in EU development programmes, and contributions to UN relief and

development agencies.

<p>

Development Cooperation Offices coordinate Irish aid in priority countries. The Agency for

Personal Service Overseas (APSO), a parastatal organisation, carries out the recruitment,

training, funding and monitoring of Irish personnel for developing countries.

<p>

An Inter-departmental Committee on Development Cooperation, in which the principal

economic departments are represented, oversees the ODA programme. A Subcommittee, the

Projects Appraisal and Evaluation Group (PAEG), chaired by the DCD assesses all projects

separately. The Subcommittee includes the desk officers of the DCD, the Evaluation and

Planning Unit of the DCD, and representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, and

Industry and Commerce, 

<p>

Planning and evaluation at the Development Cooperation Division are carried out by an

internal Planning and Evaluation Unit with the assistance of outside consultants.





<a name="adv"><hr><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>



In 1979 an Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (ACDC) was established for a

three year term. There have been four Councils since. The last one was abolished in

December 1991. The Councils have taken a very independent position and were at times

quite critical of the aid programme and of the work of the Department. Amongst others the

ACDC criticised the arrangements of the PAEG as being unwieldy and incomplete and the

absence of any substantial policy dialogue with partner developing countries.  The ACDC

used to include representatives of a wide section of Irish society, forming a broad

constituency but operating as individuals: trade unions, farmer's organisations, academics,

organisations of churches and a delegate from Northern Ireland. 

<p>

In January 1994 a new Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) was installed. The Committee has

fourteen members, who are appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The term of office

is two years. Membership is a honourary function. The function of the Committee is to offer

expert advice to the Minister on all matters relating to development cooperation and on

policy and management aspects of the aid programme. The IAAC is an independent body that

has the right of initiative. After consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs the

Committee may have research conducted on its behalf and arrange for publication. The

Committee receives an annual budget paid from bilateral ODA funds.

<p>

The Committee meets every five or six weeks while its terms of reference mention a

minimum of four meetings a year. A representative of the Department may attend meetings.

The secretariat consists of one person and is located at the Department. The Executive

Secretary works on a contract basis for the Committee and is not a civil servant. The present

agenda is not known yet since the IAAC has just started its work. 

<p>

In 1993 a new Parliamentary Sub-committee was established to deal specifically with

development cooperation. The Sub-committee can hear representatives of NGOs and

officials of the Government.



<a name="ngo"><hr><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3><p></a>



Contributions by Irish NGOs are proportionally the largest among DAC member countries.

The Government manages a co-financing program through which it funds part of the costs

of NGO-initiated projects of its "basic needs priority policy". These projects include health-care, education, water supply, sanitation, employment creation, agriculture, and rural

development. The greater part of the humanitarian assistance budget is channelled through

Irish NGOs. The NGOs identify the majority of emergency aid projects. In 1993  an estimated

2.1 per cent of total Irish ODA was channelled through the co-financing programme with

NGOs. An umbrella body, the Confederation of Non-Governmental Organisations for

Overseas Development (CONGOOD) was established in 1979. It draws together 18 aid and

missionary organisations. There are about 50 development related NGOs in Ireland. 

<p>

Representatives of the NGOs and the Minister or his officials hold regular meetings to

discuss matters of mutual interest, amongst others the prolongation of the one-year period

for co-financing projects and procedures for emergency aid and development education.

Two points of critique by the NGO-community are that the new strategy is less clearly

directed towards poverty alleviation than was expected and that personnel cooperation

overseas is increasingly tied up with procurement of goods and services in Ireland. Annually

a National Forum on Development Aid takes place, whose deliberations influence

development cooperation policy. 

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey three Irish institutes qualify as Development

Research and Training Institutes. The research community takes an active stand on

development cooperation. For instance: after the abolishment of ACDC the research

community played an active part in the installation of the new Advisory Committee.

<b><li>Low Cost Sanitation<br>
A Survey of Practical Experience</b><br>
<i>John Pickford</i><br>

About two billion people in the world have no adequate sanitation

provision whereby they can relieve themselves in a healthy,

convenient and private way. <i> Low-cost Sanitation</i> addresses this

enormous problem by providing advice and information on

appropriate sanitation coverage for both rural and urban low-

income communities. <p> 



This practical manual describes and compares a range of low-cost

systems - what they are, where they are appropriate, and how they

can be planned, built, operated and maintained.  Particular

emphasis is given to 'software' aspects - the role of women and

agencies in sanitation projects and programmes, and how

individual householders and communities improve their own

sanitation.  The author examines the underlying health, social

and cultural aspects and preferences in diverse regions of the

world; and gives evidence of the diseases which occur through

lack of adequate sanitation provision, and the health benefits

which result from its installation or upgrading. <br>

Specialists from all over the world consider the different

and sanitation.  They examine both 'software' aspects - people,

communities, health, management and institutions - and

technological considerations such as waste management.<p> 



The book comprises over forty papers presented at the 20th WEDC

Conference held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1994.  The material is

drawn from countries in all parts of the world.<br>

<b><li>Sustainable Sewerage<br>
Guidelines for community schemes</b><br>

<i>R.A. Reed</i><br>

Sanitation is one of the most basic infrastructure services and

one which many poor communities find themselves unable to afford. 

In most countries, the demand for sewerage greatly exceeds the

resources available to provide it.  There are, however, ways in

which conventional schemes can be modified - or new schemes

planned - so that the costs both of construction and of

maintenance can be brought within the reach of more people.<p>
  



This handbook describes these and suggests objective methods of

prioritizing communities' needs for sewerage.  It surveys the

planning, selection, design, management and maintenance of

community schemes, and provides technical and financial

suggestions on cost-effective practice and procedures.  Non-

conventional options are discussed as well as the conventional

approach to sewerage design and implementation.<p>



The book will be of  great interest and practical use to all

those involved in planning small community infrastructure

projects, particularly in peri-urban situations. <br>

The authors develop a new conceptual framework of the role of nutrition in famine which can be used to analyse the underlying causes of malnutrition, the stage of famine, and the risk of disease and death. This is useful as a basis for nutritional assessments, for identifying appropriate interventions, and targeting strategies. Practical suggestions for carrying out change needed for successful implementation of appropriate interventions are also considered. <p>

This book is not just for nutritionists, but for anyone who wants to alleviate famine, food insecurity and malnutrition. The book is aimed at people actually working in famine situations and at institutions concerned with nutritional emergencies, who may want to, or be able to, apply some of the lessons learned. It will also be useful to those with a more theoretical interest wanting a detailed and searching analysis of nutrition in relation to famine.<br>

<li><b>Vision 2000<br>
Moving forward after Cairo and Beijing</b><br>
The new publication, called Vision 2000: Moving Forward After Cairo and
Beijing, is one of the first by an NGO to examine the relationships between
its own goals and the mandates of the Beijing Conference and the
International Conference on Population andDevelopment (ICPD) in Cairo. <p>
The booklet will guide the work of IPPF member Family Planning Associations (FPAs) in the years ahead, and will act as an advocacy tool to encourage governments to act on the commitments of the Cairo and Beijing Conferences.
It will also be used at other international meetings, such as the UN Habitat II Conference scheduled for June 1996, to remind decision-makers of the promises already made in the areas of women's sexual and reproductive health and rights. 
<p>


In the preface to the booklet, IPPF Secretary General Ingar Brueggemann, describes the ICPD and the Beijing Women's Conference as important milestones in the understanding of the challenges and priorities for human development. The Cairo Conference moved the global debate from the demographic view of population issues toward the broader concept of sexual
and reproductive health including family planning. It emphasised the importance of women's interests, needs and rights as essential components of developmnt. The Beijing Conference went one step further, focusing on    how to achieve equality and empowerment for women in all areas of life.
<p>

The understandings and messages that emerged from the two Conferences are being integrated into IPPF's approach to tackling the six challenges identified in its Strategic Plan, Vision 2000. These challenges, which together form the basis for all of IPPF'swork are: the demand and unmet need in family planning, sexual and reproductive health, unsafe abortion, empowerment of women, youth, and quality of care.
<p>

The prime responsibility for implementing the commitments of the ICPD and Beijing Women's Conference now lies with governments, while non-governmental organizations have a vital role to play in advocating action and monitoring progress on implementation o the promises made. Vision 2000: Moving Forward After Cairo and Beijing will serve as an effective guide by listing specific commitments made by governments and suggesting actions that can be taken by IPPF, its affiliated Family Planning Associations and ther NGOs to help governments fulfil their
promises.

<b><li>In Our Own Words<br>
Disability and integration in Morocco</b></b><br>
In Morocco and throughout the world, disabled people are increasingly voicing their claim to rights rather than charity. Quality education, provision of health care, access to housing, transport and employment are essential if disabled people are to play a constructive role in society. In our own words considers:<p>
<ul>

 <b>*</b>the integration of disabled people into communities;
 <b>*</b>the particular needs of disabled women and female caregivers;
 <b>*</b>disabled children's needs and their participation in programmes and services;
 <b>*</b>community-based rehabilitation;
<b>*</b>an analysis of Save the Children's work in Morocco.</ul><p>


As well as being essential reading for local and international organisations and ministries involved in disability work, In our own words will be invaluable for researchers, development practitioners in the field. At a time when seeking the participation of project beneficiaries is recognised as crucial to successful development work, In our own words offers an example of how this has been achieved in Morocco.<br>

<b><li>Invisible Children<br>
Images and disability</b><br>
<i>"Disabled people should be shown as an ordinary part of life in all forms or representation"&nbsp;</i><br>
This was the conclusion reached at the Invisible Children conference, organised by Integration Alliance and Save the Children. It was attended by more than 150 key image makers. These included TV and film directors, producers, scriptwriter, editors, actors, authors and illustrators who came together with leading members of the Disabled People's Movement.<p>

The report looks at the arguments made for change in the way disabled people are portrayed. Presentations form key speakers include the historical portrayal of disability, and entertaining look at how disability has been presented in children's literature, a moving account of a parent's view  with practical ways forward, and a critique of moving images from TV, film and theatre.<p>

There is a summary of the plenary discussion in which various speakers give examples of the effect of exclusion and stereotyped images and changes that need to a happen.<p>

A practical list of ideas is included as the way forward, along with contact names and addresses and examples of positive representation suggested by members of Integration Alliance.<br>

<HR>

This report should be cited as: ECDPM. 1996. <i>Beyond Lom&#233; IV: Exploring Options for Future ACP-EU Cooperation</i>. (Policy Management Report No. 6). Maastricht: European Centre for Development Policy Management.

<p><hr><p>



<H3>Changing Interests in EU-ACP Trade Cooperation</H3>

<p>

<i>"Even though preferences have been and are being eroded, there will still be margins

of preference well beyond the year 2000...., together with competitive enhancing measures

[they can] enable an energised ACP private sector to get a foothold in the EU market" (ACP

Ambassador)</i>.

<p>

Despite preferential access to the EU market offered under the Lom&#233; Convention,

ACP export performance in Europe has deteriorated in the last two decades. Lom&#233;

trade provisions have now come under increased pressure and their value and existence

beyond the year 2000 are under threat. Trade is still considered to contribute to

development. The question is how trade cooperation can be adapted to become a more

suitable instrument of development, and to more effectively address the challenges faced by

ACP countries in the 21st century.

<p>

Trade relations between Europe and many ACP countries have long existed and some date

back to the colonial period. Strengthening the economic relationship between the EU and the

ACP remains important today, though probably on different grounds. Guaranteed supplies

of raw materials at stable prices may have become less of an issue for the EU these days, as

it can source them more reliably and cheaply elsewhere or has its own producers to think of.

But the ACP countries think the EU ought to have a continuing interest in the ACP as outlets

for its products, and possibly to develop spheres of influence.

<p>

This latter argument (for ACP countries to become trading bases for the EU) is identified by

some as also being in the interest of the ACP. They argue that the growing division of the

world in economic trading blocks makes it increasingly relevant for the EU to link up with its

ACP partners. For example, the Caribbean could, in the words of a local researcher, "offer

the EU a pathway to access regional markets in the hemisphere." For the ACP also, it is

beneficial that the EU acts as a counterweight to other major trading partners in their region.

"A commercial strategy for relations with the Pacific is essential to counterbalance

expansionism of the Asian block."

<p>

For many ACP countries, the trade provisions are the most valuable part of the Convention.

However, recognising the limitations of current Lom&#233; trade provisions (which are

primarily based on preferential market access), most support the search for new forms of

trade cooperation which can assist the ACP become more competitive in the world market.

<p>



<H3>Impact and Value of Preferences and Protocols: A Lost Battle?</H3>

<p>

<I>"The low impact of the privileged access give a reason to think preferences have been

irrelevant, or - worse - damaging in so far as they have encouraged dependency and kept the

status quo in place between North and South" (Pacific researcher)</I>.

<p>

On the whole, the impact of non-reciprocal preferences and the Protocols offered to the ACP

countries has been disappointing. During two decades of Lom&#233; preferences the ACP

share of the EU market dropped - from 6.7% in 1976 to 2.8% in 1994 - while less

preferred developing countries gained market share (see Table 1).

<p>

In addition, most ACP countries have failed to diversify their exports into non-traditional

products. Most have not managed to become more competitive in the world market.

Observers conclude that the preferential treatment enjoyed by the ACP countries is not

sufficient to develop their trade, and other factors appear to have limited the intended effects

of the preferences.

<p>

Some of the limiting factors identified by ACP business people are inherent in the trade

provisions. They include: some remaining non-tariff barriers on agricultural goods (even

though relief from the Common Agricultural Policy enjoyed by the ACP under the

Lom&#233; Convention is the best of any partner), the relatively protective rules of origin,

and limited awareness of the provisions and their complicated procedures. Other limiting

factors, probably more significant, are linked to the supply capacity of  ACP countries

themselves. In several ACP countries, trade and fiscal policies do not favour the expansion

of exports, and shortages of financial and physical infrastructure and skilled labour hinder

their trade development. 

<p>

However, not  too pessimistic a picture should be projected. It is argued that some ACP

countries have put preferences to good effect. These include: 

<ul>

<li>Countries such as Mauritius, Jamaica, Kenya, and Zimbabwe which diversified their economy

into non-traditional exports (clothing, processed fish and horticultural exports for example)

for which preferential margins were relatively large compared to traditional commodity

exports.

<p>

<li>Countries such as Fiji and Saint Lucia which benefited from one or more of the Lom&#233;

Protocols on rum, beef and veal, bananas and sugar (see Box 4.1). 

</ul><p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center><h3>Box 4.1: Significance of Protocols: Stakeholder

Estimates</center></h3>

The Protocols for Sugar, Bananas, Rum and Beef and Veal give free access to EU markets for

a fixed quantity of exports from selected traditional ACP suppliers. For the Sugar and Banana

Protocols, ACP countries also benefit from a relatively generous EU price for their exports

(often two to three times higher than the world price in the case of sugar) thanks to the

Common Agricultural Policy. Trade liberalisation has put the benefits of higher prices and the

guaranteed access of the Protocols at risk, while the pressure of the WTO and major trading

partners also threatens their very existence - as demonstrated in the banana dispute involving

the Windward Islands in the Caribbean. 

<p>

Sugar Protocol. The transfer linked to the price stability and guaranteed market access

provided by the sugar Protocol is substantial. For Mauritius and Guyana it amounts to 6%

of GDP; in Fiji it was estimated at account for about 4% of GDP between 1980 and 1990.

The importance of these transfers in underlined by the large numbers of people dependent

on the sugar indistry -- in Fiji, sugar represents 40% of the agricultural sector and provides

direct employment for 25% of the economically active population.

<p>

Banana Protocol. Banana exports accounted for around 78% of agricultural exports by the

Windward Islands in 1990. In terms of the share of total export earnings from the EU, this

represents approximately 90% in St Lucia and Dominica, 60% in St Vincent, and 20% for

Grenada in 1992. The share of GDP in 1988 varied from 37% for St Lucia, 32% for

Dominica, 25% for St Vincent and 4% for Grenada. The privileged and guaranteed market

access that Windward Island banana producers enjoy over the Latin American "dollar" banana

producers, has to be substantial considering these statistics. Without the Protocol they are

unlikely to be able to compete in the EU market without major improvements in quality and

productivity. 

<p>

Beef Protocol. On average, Botswana, which is the main beneficiary of the Beef and Veal

Protocol received annual payments from the export of beef to the EU of 24 million Ecu

between 1990-94. This equals 20% of all development assistance received.

</table></center>

<p>

If Lom&#233; trade provisions are not extended, countries which have benefited most from

them will be most adversely affected. For other ACP countries, the potential positive impact

will be taken away and exports are not likely to pick up without alternative measures that

address trade development. 

<p>

Nevertheless, international trade liberalisation - as agreed in the recent Uruguay Round for

instance - and new trade arrangements granted by the EU to other trading partners, such as

the Mediterranean and Central and Eastern European countries, are likely to further erode

the value of preferences and thereby reduce their potential impact in ACP countries. The

question is therefore whether Lom&#233; preferences are still worth fighting for, especially

now when the international trade environment is much less generous towards them.

<p>



<H3>WTO Incompatibility - Does it Matter?</H3>

<p>

Apart from the effectiveness and desirability of the continuation of non-reciprocal preferences

and Protocols, their political acceptability in the international environment will determine

their future. As it stands, many of the basic Lom&#233; trade provisions are incompatible

with the spirit of the Post-Uruguay Round arrangements policed by the World Trade

Organisation (WTO). The ACP exception to the most favoured nation (mfn) principle is

more difficult to defend than before. For two main reasons:

<ul>

Discrimination among developing countries. ACP countries receive more favourable access

than countries of a similar level of income which makes the provisions unacceptable as an

advance on the mfn treatment for developing countries. 

<p>

Non-reciprocal nature of Lom&#233; preferences. The trade agreement between the EU and

the ACP cannot be accepted as an exception in the context of a regional trade agreement

(WTO article 24) because it is non-reciprocal.</ul>

<p>

The Lom&#233; Convention received a waiver from the WTO for its non-compliance with

the mfn principle, but this will expire in February 2000. The current situation is therefore

unsatisfactory, even if it was extended after 2000. The argument put forward by many

people is that this unsustainable situation must be remedied and that compatibility with the

WTO is an unavoidable criterion for future trade arrangements between the EU and ACP.

Others argue that the WTO is primarily a political forum in which the EU and ACP together

could have sufficient clout to make the current type of preferences acceptable to the other

trading partners -- if the EU has the political will to do so.

<p>

The difficulty with the compatibility issue is that none of the current alternatives to make

Lom&#233; more "WTO compatible" are without problems, not least because the WTO

rules were not drafted with a Lom&#233;-style arrangement of North-South cooperation in

mind. One suggestion is therefore to modify the WTO rules by developing a new model of

North-South trade cooperation alongside article 24.

<p>

One way to make Lom&#233; more compatible under the existing rules is to extend ACP

membership to include all developing countries of similar levels of development. As well as

complying with the non-discrimination principle of the WTO, this would satisfy internal EU

critics who are unhappy with the concentration in the ACP of ex-colonies of a small number

of member states. Another alternative may be to introduce reciprocity in the context of a

free trade agreement between the EU and the ACP countries.

<p>



<H3>Reciprocity or Non-reciprocity?</H3>

<p>

Non-reciprocal preferences have reached their outer limits or are "past their sell-by-date" and

could no longer be instrumental in improving ACP trade performance. (Caribbean researcher

and business representative)

<p>

Aside from any compatibility with the WTO, reciprocity could benefit ACP states by bringing

them the economic benefits associated with liberalisation. An alternative view however, is that

the link between reciprocity and the WTO is not so clear-cut. Proponents of this view argue

that efficiency gains are usually associated with liberalisation towards all trade partners and

not just a partial opening to one. Furthermore, there is a danger that reciprocity is not

sufficient to sustain a case under WTO article 24 on free trade areas because it would not

cover a sufficient share of the trade between the partners. 

<p>

EU representatives favour reciprocity - they stand to lose little from it - and associate it with

the concept of mutual interest between the EU and ACP. The ACP side wonder what they

would gain by opening up their markets to European exporters, while under the current

agreement they already have almost full access to the EU market (see Box 4.2). One

conclusion is that gains and losses would vary by country and decisions call for a case by case

evaluation.

<p>

The region most prepared to exchange current trade provisions for a regional agreement with

the EU based on some degree of reciprocity is the Caribbean. According to representatives

from the Caribbean, the advantages include increased security and transparency that benefits

trade and investment, opportunities to negotiate further access for agricultural products and

to restore some of the lost value of other preferences, and the possibility of assistance for

trade and investment development -- including special incentives for joint ventures between

EU and Caribbean companies. Most African representatives fear, however, that their local

industries would not survive the competition by EU exports in their markets. They are afraid

it will cause their manufacturing industries, which are already fragile, to collapse, leading to

increased unemployment and possible social unrest. 

<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center><h3>

Box 4.2: Costs and Benefits to the ACP of Reciprocity</center></h3>

costs:

<ul>

<li>loss of fiscal revenue previously gained by the ACP from taxes on EU imports;

ACP producers will face fiercer competition from EU exporters of the same goods in their

own country. If no protection is maintained this could cause companies to go out of business

and unemployment to rise;

<li>possible negative implications this may have for ACP relations with other major trading

partners which currently offer generalised preferences.

</ul><p>

benefits:

<ul>

<li>will reduce the cost of EU imports to ACP consumers and producers of final products;

could be used as bargaining tool for increased market access, dismantling of non-tariff

barriers and protective rules of origin, and trade development assistance;

<li>when introduced in the context of a free trade agreement, may ensure more secure

access, transparency and stable rules compared to a temporary preferential scheme;

<li>increases likelihood of acceptance by WTO.

</ul></table></center>

<p>



<H3>Conditions for an ACP-friendly Transition to Reciprocity</H3>

<p>

It is generally agreed that the EU needs to provide for an ACP-friendly transition to

reciprocity if and when it is introduced. Several conditions for such a smooth transition

have been suggested by the ACP.

<p>

A set of  new trade arrangements will need to be asymmetrical in time and probably in

coverage of products, include the right of ACP countries to protect certain sectors and

products, and have an adjustment period. This could vary between regions and countries

according to criteria such as their levels of development, income or human development,

debt overhang, level of competitiveness, vulnerability to preference erosion, and export

dependency on the EU market.

<p>

These factors already hint at a differentiated approach among ACP countries -- both

between and within regions. In terms of income levels, the previous chapter has already

indicated that variations among ACP countries and between ACP and other developing

countries are too large to ignore. Regions and countries also differ in the constraints they

suffer in developing their trade.

<p>

The need for differentiated approaches is clear. In their dependence on the EU market for

export revenue, ACP countries differ extensively. Global changes that do not take account

of differences and especially of the vulnerability of some states will be disastrous. In Africa

for example, the average dependency of countries on the EU market is 46%, in the

Caribbean it is 18%, and in the Pacific it is 23%. Within regions, there are also large

variations. In the Caribbean, the dependency rate in St. Lucia is 70% and in St Vincent it is

60%. In the Pacific, Vanuatu relies on the EU market for 53% of its export earnings while in

Africa, Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, Mauritius, Niger and Uganda are all

above 75%.

<p>



<H3>Options for Revitalised Trade Cooperation</H3>

<p>

<i>"Artificial trade protection [for ACP countries] cannot be maintained indefinitely" (EU

representative)</i>.

<p>

<H4>Non-reciprocal Lom&#233; preferences for ACP states</H4>

<p>

This option can be seen as the near-status quo and has the advantage that the Lom&#233;

acquis is maintained and preferences are not lost. To compensate for preference erosion

caused by increased access provided to other EU trading partners, scope for extra

concessions and relaxed rules of origin can be investigated. However, considering the

difficulties encountered in the mid-term review of Lom&#233; IV, this may not be easy. To

address the relatively modest success of preferences so far, more attention should be paid

to other factors impacting on trade performance (see Box 4.3 for some suggestions). To the

extent that the agreement remains limited to ACP countries, it continues to be

discriminatory and will not be WTO compatible. Nonetheless the ACP have a 'window' until

2000 to exploit existing preferences to the maximum and to test-run new techniques that

enhance their competitiveness.

<p>

<H4>Non-reciprocal preferences for all developing countries</H4>

<p>

In this scenario, least developed countries are integrated into a Lom&#233;-type agreement,

while ACP countries of a higher level of development would graduate to the Generalised

System of Preferences (GSP). Or, all ACP countries are integrated in a global and graduated

trade policy towards developing countries in the form of a renewed GSP.

<p>

Either way, ACP countries share their privileges in the EU market with other developing

countries (such as Bangladesh) and face more competition. Some of the more developed

ACP countries would see their access to the EU market reduced. The advantage may be that

such an agreement would be WTO compatible. As it remains a non-reciprocal agreement,

there is no increased competition from EU exporters in ACP markets.

<p>



<H4>Asymmetric free trade agreements based on reciprocity</H4>

<p>

This type of agreement would oblige ACP countries to gradually open their markets to EU

exporters. One option is to establish a Free Trade Area (FTA) between the EU and all ACP

countries. However, this may be impractical and undesirable as it implies that all ACP

countries need to also open their borders to each other (if the WTO definition of an FTA is

applied).

<p>

A more likely version of this option is to establish regional agreements between the EU and

sub-regions of the ACP. This matches the current fashion for region-to-region agreements

in which the EU is taking an active part. Access to the EU market would remain the same

as now, including the advantages which ACP countries have over other developing

countries, but they would provide reciprocal advantages to the EU in exchange. The WTO

is more likely to approve of such an agreement -- especially if the agreement complies with

the conditions that "substantially all trade" is included in the agreement (although it has not

defined what this means yet) and that the transition to the free trade agreement takes no

more than 10-12 years. Maintaining protection for certain industries and sectors beyond the

transitional period, as some propose, is not allowed under the current WTO regulations for

an FTA.

<p>

Under this scenario, ACP producers would face fiercer competition with EU goods in ACP

markets, which is in the interest of the EU producers and makes the trade agreement

potentially easier to defend in the EU.

<p>



<H4>Umbrella Lom&#233; Convention with variable geometry</H4>

<p>

This combines non-reciprocal and reciprocal agreements in an agreement in which the

general Lom&#233; framework is maintained, together with a structure that allows some

ACP regions (or countries) to voluntarily go further in their trade arrangements with the

EU than others and to trade mutual "concessions." These could include reciprocity. This

would introduce an &#224; la carte element to the trade relationship.

<p>

General support and access would be available to all under the framework agreement.

Additional specialised support and new provisions would vary according to the needs of

particular sub-groups. For example, least developed countries might require additional

assistance to improve supply capacity while more competitive states would gain from

improved access to, for example, services and investment. 

<p>

In this, and the previous option for a regional FTA's, a framework agreement along the lines

of the Lom&#233; Convention could remain, with the ACP group also retained. The EU could

also negotiate with each region individually. If this was to happen, a break-up of ACP

solidarity and a reduction in its political clout in negotiations would be unavoidable. On the

other hand, it might make it easier to focus on regional needs without having to find

compromises to accommodate the needs of other regions (such as concessions on

particular products or relaxation of some rules of origin).

<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center><h3>Box 4.3: Measures to Support Trade

Development</h3></center>

<p>

Whichever scenario is considered, both the EU and the ACP should try to ensure that

market access provisions provided to ACP exporters are used better. Considering that ACP

advantage over other exporters will decline in coming years (there is little scope for new

preferences), it is clear that the ACP must prepare themselves for greater competition in

the international trade environment. Suggested ways to assist ACP countries include:

<ul>

<li>addition of innovative instruments such as an export financing and guarantee scheme

which relieves the constraints of exporters and producers;

<li>support for research, training and technical cooperation aimed at increasing

productivity, efficiency and diversification in ACP countries;

<li>continued support for infrastructure on a national and regional basis;

<li>channelling of more information and financing directly to commercial organisations

which utilise the provisions;

<li>strengthening the ACP to become more significant players in international trade

negotiations;

<li>assistance to countries in the adoption of new trade-related standards.

</ul></table></center>

<p>

<H3>What Next?</H3>

<p>

The fundamental question remaining is whether any of these options would facilitate and 

encourage the integration of the ACP countries in the world economy as is called for by the

Treaty of Maastricht (article 130u). Although it may be accepted that the current Lom&#233;

provisions need to be adapted in order to take account of the specific needs of the ACP

countries in an increasingly competitive environment, it may not be enough to update

trade cooperation between the EU and the ACP alone.

<p>

The development of a new model for North-South cooperation which would address the

difficulties of the least developed countries may actually touch on principles which are

currently taken for granted in the international trade environment. 

<p>

For example, "globalisation" has taken on a major role in current trade discussions. The

Chairperson of the ACP Committee of Ambassadors, as well as some European NGO's see

globalisation conflicting with the needs of development (see Annex 1). They would prefer

that the EU contributes to the emergence of a framework of trade rules that facilitate "fair

trade" and ensure that trade contributes not just to growth but also to development. This

implies a re-thinking of the EC's global trade policy as well as sufficient political will to

influence WTO debates in this direction. Box 4.4 lists some criteria to be considered in judging the suitability of new trade

arrangements between the EU and the ACP.

<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center><h3>Box 4.4: Criteria to Assess the Suitability of New Trade Arrangements</h3></center>

<ul>

<li>maintain or even expand the value and scope of Lom&#233; trade provisions;

improve the impact of trade provisions on diversification, competitiveness, attraction of

investment and growth in ACP countries;

<li>smooth transitional period with intermediary measures and instruments;

<li>differentiated approach adapted to needs of various groups of countries;

<li>support for regional cooperation as a way to stimulate integration of ACP countries in the

world economy;

<li>enable countries to compete with other regional trading blocks;

<li>contributes to trade rules that facilitate "fair trade" and ensures that trade contributes not

just to growth but to development;

<li>coherence between EU trade and development policies;

allows ACP countries to be part of other reciprocal trading agreements;

<li>acceptable to the WTO and major trading partners of the EU and ACP;

<li>justifiable in view of interests of European producers.</table></center>

<p>



Given the wide variation in views among ACP and EU actors, no effort is made to prioritise

them. Further work is needed to evaluate the four options outlined above, overall and

country-by-country, and to refine the criteria into a set to which both the EU and ACP can

agree. Additional work is needed to:

<ul>

<li>estimate the practical and economic implications of these options for ACP and EU

economies;

<p>                                                                                                           

<li>suggest instruments and intermediary measures that can be introduced to support trade

development and especially a smooth transition to a new set of arrangements;

<p>

<li>consider how a global EC trade policy can take account of the needs and difficulties

of the least developed and least competitive countries.

</ul>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font size=+1>The World-Wide Web is becoming increasingly important for the young, for both educational and entertainment reasons. (Even Santa Claus has a home page.)<p>
But the Web is an anarchic place.  Nobody is making sure unsavoury pictures of sex and violence aren't available on all our computer screens.<hr width=71%>
<p></font>
For many adults, that's not a problem.  But it is for parents - and teachers in charge of other people's children - who want to be sure that kids aren't stumbling across material they wouldn't dream of letting them see on television or in magazines.
<p>
But now there are several software packages that block out unsavoury parts of the Internet. Parents and teachers can rest assured about their children's welfare while the kids surf the rest of the Internet unhindered.  <p>

<i><h3>What are they?</h3></i>

<li><h2><a href="http://www.microsys.com/cyber/">CYBER PATROL</a></h2>
<ul>Cyber Patrol allows parents to choose when and where their children surf.  Parents can block specific times of the day (like peak telephone rate times), specific newsgroups, ftp sites or Web sites.  <p>

And they can also enter a list of 'approved sites' to be surfed around in safety.  The makers even draw up their own updated list of banned sites, which parents can download over the Internet.</ul>

<li><h2><a href="http://www.leaf.co.uk/netnanny.htm">NET NANNY</a> (PC only)</h2>
<ul>Basically, Net Nanny does what you tell her to.  She will do anything from making a note of  a 'forbidden' word in a log-book to actually shutting down the Internet-access program altogether. <p>

Concerned teachers and parents can enter forbidden words - like 'sex' - into a special dictionary, and Net Nanny will take action whenever they are encountered on a page.  (But won't this cause problems for home pages in Middlesex and Essex?  In short, yes.  So Net Nanny's dictionary now includes 'alt.sex' instead.)<p>
</ul>

<li><h2><a href="http://www.solidoak.com/cybersit.htm">CYBERSITTER</a></h2>

<ul>CyberSitter is another filtering program - except that instead of looking for restricted words, it looks for restricted file types, including pictures (gif or jpg files) and encoded images from newsgroups.  It prevents their transfer down the Internet, and keeps your hard disk clean.<p>
A new version is due out soon, which will also block access to pre-defined Web sites.  Click on the title above to find out the latest.<p></ul>

<H3>Erosion of the Lom&#233; Partnership </H3>

<p>

<I>"Partnership has become a label devoid of meaning, which no longer reflects a true desire to cooperate

on the basis of a shared political agenda; it has become the prisoner of short-term, bureaucratic aid

management concerns" (African parliamentarian)</I>.

<p>

"Partnership" has been a central, almost magical notion in ACP-EU relations. The first Lom&#233;

Convention (1975) claimed to introduce a contractually agreed "partnership between equals", based on

mutual rights and obligations. Both parties made long-term commitments to achieve common goals. ACP

countries took a lead role in managing Lom&#233; resources, with the EU playing a supportive role. A

(rather complex) set of joint institutions was set up to structure different forms of dialogue and to promote

effective implementation. This concept of partnership, together with the principles of dialogue,

contractuality and predictability, add up to the so-called "Lom&#233; culture."

<p>

Twenty years later, the Lom&#233; partnership has lost much of its soul and practical effects. Its

evolution has been compared with the move of a pendulum. Lom&#233; I (1975) put the ACP partners

clearly in the driving seat, with Europe adopting a "laisser-faire" attitude ("it's your money, you decide

on its use"). Successive Conventions sought to integrate donor concerns into the partnership. Currently,

the pendulum seems to have shifted further to the opposite extreme, with the EU adopting an increasingly

"paternalistic" approach ("it's our money and we decide on its use"). 

<p>

The erosion of the Lom&#233; partnership is confirmed by consultations in the field and at the ECDPM

conference. Disillusionment and frustration are growing on both sides of the relationship.

<p>

On the whole, the ACP countries feel they are no longer Europe's preferred partners, in terms of both

trade and aid. Conditionalities are replacing dialogue. Development models are imposed by the donor

community, often with little consideration for local realities, implementation constraints, and differences

between countries.

<p>

Efficiency concerns force the EU to reduce recipient roles in partnership and rather general "hands-on"

approaches are applied to all ACP countries. Furthermore, complex and rigid procedures make it difficult

for each country to benefit from available instruments and resources. Non-state actors in ACP countries

are also frustrated and see Lom&#233; as a "thing of the government." Such a monopoly position is seen

as outdated and ineffective. There is furthermore a largely shared perception that the EU does not have

a long-term vision on how to support ACP development.

<p>

At the EU level (the European Commission and Member States), it is argued that genuine partnerships

are difficult to establish with ACP countries that have poor governance or administrative capacities. This

leaves little room for transparent and efficient use of resources. It leads the Commission to adopt a more

interventionist (substitution) approach. Its staff in the field observe that the Lom&#233; partnership has

become a "burden" rather than a development tool. 

<p>

Most admit that the Commission lacks human and institutional capacity to properly assume its role in

partnership. At the global policy level, the ACP are no longer at the top of EU geopolitical, economic and

security concerns. The perceived limited effectiveness and impact of Lom&#233; further compounds its

legitimacy crisis. This erosion of EU interest for the ACP countries is heavily criticised by European

(lobbying) NGO's. They see this downward trend as short-sighted and contradicting stated EU policies

on poverty alleviation.  

<p>



<H3>Towards a Modern and Business-like Partnership</H3>

<p>

This rather gloomy picture of partnership raises major questions for the EU and the ACP. Is

partnership still a useful concept? Are the basic principles of the Convention and related

procedures still valid or are they in need of a fundamental reform? How can the Lom&#233;

partnership be revitalised? 

<p>



<H4>A valid concept in need of thorough redefinition ...</H4>

<p>

The adequacy of the term "partnership" for future Lom&#233; cooperation is the subject

of a lively debate. Some favour dropping it altogether, arguing that it makes little sense to

keep alive a myth of an "equal partnership." Others warn that such a move may reduce

cooperation to mere "charity." They argue that there is nothing wrong with the basic

principles of the Lom&#233; partnership (i.e. recipient responsibility, dialogue and

predictability).

<p>

The problem is rather with the application of these principles. A partnership cannot be

assumed to exist simply because a contract has been signed; it needs to be achieved rather

than declared. With hindsight, one could argue that the implementation of the Lom&#233;

partnership was based on too many assumptions, including the existence of common interests

and shared objectives, well-functioning and accountable governments in ACP countries, EU

preparedness to tackle internal inconsistencies, and capacities in both the ACP countries and

the Commission to effectively manage Lom&#233;. 

<p>

In addition, Lom&#233; partners have largely failed to adjust the Convention to major

changes in the international policy environment (such as shifting views on the role of the

state; participation of non-state actors) and to the new requirements of development

cooperation (governance, accountability, transparency). As a result, the Lom&#233;

partnership has become obsolete in many respects.      

<p>

Against this background, partnership appears to be a valid form of cooperation, but its

rationale, elements and modus operandi need to be fundamentally reviewed. This means

tackling pervasive implementation problems on both sides of the relationship and modernising

the Lom&#233; partnership.

<p>



<H4>... based on detached analysis of current bottlenecks </H4>

<p>

The next step is to identify the main shortcomings of current partnership approaches. Five

major factors can be identified:

<ul>

<li>Weak political foundations. When the first Lom&#233; Convention was signed, there

were strong historical ties and perceived mutual interdependencies between Europe and the

ACP countries. This no longer holds true. Current partnership is primarily concerned with

mobilising, spending and accounting for aid. In such a restrictive interpretation, the focus is

on "bureaucratic control" rather than on the "substance" of cooperation. In the words of an

ACP participant: "there can be no partnership in the absence of a sound political basis for

cooperation; it becomes a mere form of assistance with donor agencies inevitably in the

driving seat." 

<p>

<li>ACP and EU cohesion. It takes "two to tango" and it is not evident that the ACP and

EU groups are suitable dancing partners. While there may be good reasons to keep the ACP

group together, ACP solidarity also has a cost. Several ACP respondents admit that the group

is simply "too large and too heterogeneous" to broker a deal with the EU that suits the needs

of the different ACP partners. A similar situation prevails at the EU side. An increasingly

fragmented Commission has to cope with 15 Member States, each with different perceptions

on development and the specific role of the Commission. Not surprisingly, little progress has

been achieved in the field of coordination and policy coherence.

<p>

<li>Balance and reciprocity. Finding a "match" between recipient needs and donor priorities

is a problem in most partnerships. Either-or approaches offer no solution. Donor-driven

approaches look tempting, but will fail without recipient ownership and participation.

Promoting democratic reform, for instance, can be a shared objective of EU-ACP

cooperation. However, as an African participant observes: "it makes little sense to see

democratisation as a 100 meter Olympic sprint; each country should be given the chance to

develop its own system of democracy." At the same time, there is nothing wrong with donors

putting forward their own objectives and priorities. This is often a precondition for continued

support by European tax payers. The Lom&#233; partnership still has to find a "break-even"

point where recipient needs can be reconciled with donor priorities in a mutually acceptable

way.

<p>

<li>State monopoly. The overwhelming consensus is that the Lom&#233; potential has not

been fully tapped because it depends too heavily on the state. This dependence prevents

other actors (the private sector) to assume their roles in development (on the basis of the

subsidiarity principle). Particularly in countries with weak and unaccountable governments,

this is a recipe for failure. Also at the European side, there is scope to partly "de-

bureaucratise" the management of development cooperation programmes.

<p>

<li>Lack of appropriate implementation strategies. Defining an enlightened set of basic

principles is a necessary, but not sufficient step to ensure effective implementation. In the

view of many practitioners, the Convention lacks a clear operational framework, adapted to

the growing heterogeneity of ACP countries and the capacities of the European Commission.

For instance, giving a lead role to ACP countries is a necessary, but not sufficient condition

to make partnership work. These basic principles need to be translated into clear operational

systems that can be adapted to different local conditions and capacities.

<H3>Building Blocks of a Modern Partnership</H3>

<p>

How can a new culture of partnership be developed? What are the constituent elements of

a more mature and efficient partnership? What needs to be dropped, safeguarded or added

to the current Lom&#233; culture? In this section, we review some of main options raised

during the consultation process.

<p>

<h4>Give partnership a solid political basis</h4>

<p>

Future ACP-EU cooperation will have a more political character. Human rights, democracy

and good governance are now essential elements of the partnership. The EC sees the

promotion of the "rule of law" as a key development objective. "Politicisation" is likely to

increase as development cooperation is more strongly shaped by domestic economic

conditions and changing foreign policy and security concerns rather than by the needs of

developing countries. 

<p>

The winds are also changing on the ACP side. Dissatisfaction with current aid approaches and

fear for the future fuel the search for a new political partnership with Europe. This is

gradually leading to a split within ACP countries. Those resisting change are coming under

pressure as was shown at the Joint ACP-EU Assembly in Namibia (March 1996) where ACP

countries supported a resolution condemning the Nigerian regime. 

<p>

These changes are promising. They suggest that a 'new deal' can be brokered. However, the

ACP argue that this requires improved dialogue. Current approaches are more like political

dictates than agreements negotiated between equals. Such approaches do not allow for serious

consideration of local political realities, home-grown alternatives to policy reform, themes

important to the ACP, donor inconsistencies and double standards. To move forward, the

process of ACP-EU dialogue needs to be refined (see Box 5.1).

<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=8>

<tr><td><center><h3>Box 5.1: Refining the ACP - EU Dialogue</h3></center>

<ul>

<li>create a real political dialogue based on clear definitions of shared political objectives

and mutual interests;

<li>open political dialogue to non-state actors;

<li>use partnership to arrive at mutually binding commitments (rather than unilaterally

imposed conditionalities);

<li>define, on a pragmatic basis, appropriate role divisions between partners; 

<li>revamp the joint institutions -- which many view as having become "jamborees" rather

than policy-making fora;

<li>improve transparency and communication (for example, by making EC country papers

open for discussion and by showing the benefits of political dialogue).

</ul></table></center>

<p>

<h4>Match recipient needs with donor concerns</h4>

<p>

<i>"Donor agencies have a major role to play in promoting serious macro-economic policies

and governance in weak ACP countries. In any type of partnership, realistic conditions should

be discussed and jointly agreed upon. If, for any reason, promises are broken, donors have

the obligation to withdraw their resources" (Representative from African civil society)</i>.

<p>

Achieving a subtle balance between recipient responsibility and donor accountability is the

key to a "mature" partnership. Many ACP respondents argue that "the best partnership is to

be found where there is maximum overlap between recipient aspirations and donor

expectations."   

<p>

The Lom&#233; partnership has not been very successful in finding this balance. Recent

reforms have accommodated legitimate donor concerns. Yet in the process, the principle of

"recipient responsibility" has been eroded too far. For instance, the EC tendency to substitute

for defaulting governments is seen as a backward step into the realm of paternalism or even

a "capitulation" to the real development task ahead. 

<p>

A preferred option for future partnership relations that emerges from ongoing discussions can

be summarised as:

<p>

There can be no major discount on the principle of "recipient responsibility" in the name of

short-term (aid) efficiency. Development is an internal process. Donors can act as agencies

of restraint and can help to implement major reforms. But at the end of the day, no amount

of external pressure can substitute for domestic responsibilities.

<p>

It is perfectly legitimate for donors to put money where it can best be used. However, instead

of reverting to old-style, donor-driven and control-oriented approaches, the Commission

should adopt country specific approaches. Where real trust exists, a flexible and open-ended

partnership could be agreed; if a mutually acceptable "matching" of expectations cannot be

found, the EC should consider alternatives to partnership.

<p>

The evolution of articles 4 and 5 of the Lom&#233; Convention (related to the objectives

of development cooperation) is an example of this. In its current version (Lom&#233; IV

bis), the Convention proposes a match between ACP development priorities and those of the

EU (as expressed by the Treaty of Maastricht). From a European perspective, it was argued

that it was difficult to see how the Treaty's broad development objectives (sustainable

development, poverty alleviation, integration of  developing countries in the world economy,

human rights, and democracy) could conflict with ACP interests, at least in terms of

principles. The real challenge is rather to develop new mechanisms to ensure a fair and

balanced application of these principles. 

<p>

Further work is needed to work out the modalities of such partnerships. Two steps are of

paramount importance. First, to build capacity in ACP countries for partnership. This means

creating conditions for them to develop their own ideas, plans and strategies. Targeted

capacity building support to both public sector institutions and (autonomous) think tanks will

help to ensure a more recipient-driven policy dialogue. Second, to delegate management

authority to the field. This is a precondition for partnership approaches inspired by local

realities rather than by official discourse.

<p>



<H4>Find alternatives to "aid entitlements"</H4>

<p>

<i>"The continuation of partnership will depend on ACP preparedness to ensure a

'responsible management' of external resources provided to them" (EU official)</i>.

<p>

The Lom&#233; culture of  "aid entitlements" - based on five-year country allocations

regardless of performance - is hard to reconcile with a modern and business-like partnership

in which there is room to critically assess the recipient country's performance in fulfilling

mutually agreed obligations. 

<p>

The EU in particular argues that future cooperation should be based on performance.

External support is there "to help those that help themselves." This calls for greater selectivity

in the choice of partners and differentiation between "good performers" and "poor

performers." The "end of the entitlement culture" also means that new criteria for aid

allocation need to be defined. This raises major questions with regard to substance and

process. 

<p>

With regard to substance, it is suggested that future aid allocations should be based on two

major criteria: needs and merits. The 'needs' criterion should not be a major bone of

contention. It would, for instance, make it possible to put poverty alleviation upfront in

future cooperation. This is a shared political objective of both the Lom&#233; Convention

and the Maastricht Treaty. Furthermore, poverty levels can be 'measured' in a relatively

objective way.

<p>

Allocating aid on the basis of 'merit' is more delicate. Merit can be assessed at different

levels, including performance in managing (Lom&#233;) aid, adopting sound macro-

economic policies or ensuring 'good governance'. Major controversies are likely to exist on

how this type of performance can be measured. Options being explored are:

<ul>

<li>Absorptive capacity. This option is heavily criticised as assessing ACP performance on

the basis of quantitative targets (how much money has been disbursed?) rather than

qualitative criteria (what results have been achieved?). Effective implementation is seen as a

more promising yardstick. 

<p>

<li>Economic performance. In this option, 'good performers' include those countries that

take macro-economic reform seriously. For the EU, the proposed standards would probably

be largely in line with those of the Bretton Woods institutions (albeit with greater attention

to social and other "soft" dimensions of adjustment). ACP countries may have different

views, especially with regard to the content, pace and sequencing of reforms.

<p>

<li>Political performance. While the concept of "human rights" is seen as an intangible

criterion, there is less unanimity on "democracy" or "governance." Europeans contacted in

this study prefer the concept of "responsible governance" -- which seems a more objective

criterion than the highly normative concept of democracy. ACP representatives warn against

too rigid definitions of any such criterion; they are also sceptical about attempts to measure,

let alone to quantify political performance.

</ul><p>

On process, it is essential that new criteria for aid allocation be jointly identified and applied.

This requires independent research, extensive dialogue and institutional mechanisms to ensure

proper implementation and monitoring.

<p>

<H4>Reach beyond government</H4>

<p>

<i>"Bureaucrats should no longer be the main actors in future EU-ACP partnerships"

(representative of African private sector)</i>.

<p>

The period when development partnerships are "reserved" for governments seems definitively

over. This was confirmed during our consultation process. The overwhelming majority of ACP

respondents feel that any new cooperation agreement needs to be based on a "pluralistic

partnership." 

<p>

Here again, the critical test is with implementation. Current Lom&#233; partners have little

experience in working with a wide range of actors. Changes of attitude and roles are required

at different levels; the role of central agencies needs redefinition; new decision-making and

management systems are required; and inter-institutional cooperation - rather than

competition - to be promoted. This all requires  new capacities at all levels. (see chapter 6).

Clarify European responsibilities in the new partnership

<p>

Partnership is a two-way street. EU demands for improved recipient governance, transparency

and accountability would be more credible if similar standards are also applied to the donor

partner. The challenge in the next years is to explore operational ways to restore reciprocity

in partnership. Three main priority actions are:

<ul>

<li>Improved coherence. If taken seriously, this debate opens a huge and complex agenda.

Greater EU coherence can be achieved at the level of EU procedures, cooperation policies

and instruments (between aid and trade). It calls on the Commission to clarify its specific role

and added value (compared to the 15 Member States). Perhaps the most difficult area is

coherence between different EU policies affecting developing countries (agricultural policies

for example).

<p>

<li>Support in international fora. It is generally agreed that the EU could do more to

defend the interests of its ACP partners in the WTO and the Bretton Woods Institutions

where the EU is a heavyweight. However, the primary responsibility remains in the ACP

group itself which, so far, has done little to ensure effective representation in key decision-

making fora outside Brussels.

<p>

<li>Debt. The message is clear: the development prospects of the ACP are bleak in the

absence of a solution to the debt problem. This structural impediment should be integrated

in a future partnership agreements. The EC is expected to put this item on the agenda of the

Member States.

<h3>Box 4: Technologies for women and the landless: improved poultry production promoted by the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee</h3>
<p>
In Bangladesh, almost 50 per cent of rural households are landless or near-landless, and women face cultural restrictions on work outside the household compound. Livestock production is one activity which can be conducted within the compound. Poultry production alone is estimated to account for 23 per cent of per capita animal protein consumption in the form of both meat and eggs, but mortality is high and productivity low. 
<p>
Following a number of unsuccessful efforts to upgrade poultry production in 1979-83, but the mid-1980s, BRAC had devised a complementary set of technical and local institutional innovations which by 1990 had been replicated by government and other NGOs in 7,400 villages, affecting some 10 per cent of poultry production. The innovations comprised:
<p>
- One poultry worker (female) per 1,000 birds, trained in rearing techniques, health care and vaccination;
<p>
 - Vaccines for the poultry worker provided by the Department of Livestock (DoL), and training provided jointly by DoL and BRAC; her remuneration covered largely from vaccination fees;
<p>
 - The establishment of systems to allow poultry keepers access either to day-old chicks from government breeding farmers or, if they did not feel confident enough to handle such young birds, to two-month-old chicks reared at special units set up by BRAC and DoL, but managed by local key rearers, capable of rearing batches of 250 chicks from day-old to two months; 
<p>
- A feed production centre serving several villages to provide a balanced feed supplement for cross-bred stock. Scaling-up of the scheme means that over 33,000 key rearers are now operating commercially, and almost 5,500 poultry workers have been trained. Demand for day-old chicks from government hatcheries has risen from 0.5 million/year in the mid-1980s to almost two million currently. However, the system remains crucially dependent on the capacity of government to deliver inputs, especially vaccines, down to the local level.

<h2>&quot;BEYOND RAIN MAN&quot; NATIONAL SURVEY RESULTS</h2>


Today, (2nd December) the first day of Autism Awareness Week,  sees the release of the results of a
national survey  investigating levels of understanding and awareness of autism. The survey, called 'Beyond
Rain Man',   looks at the experiences of carers of people with autism and Asperger syndrome,  the general
public's  awareness and understanding of autistic spectrum disorders and includes interviews with people
with autism, giving an insight into how they perceive the world.  Harris Research Centre carried out the
survey, which was commissioned by The National Autistic Society. 

<p>'Beyond Rain Man' shows that 99% of carers felt the general public have little understanding of what it
is like to care for a person with autism. 84% had experienced people staring at them and 57% had
experienced people making unwelcome comments when out with the person they care for.  These
comments included:

<p>&quot;There should be euthanasia for kids like yours - he'll never be any use to himself or anyone
else.&quot;

<p>&quot;My dog acts better than that.&quot;

<p>&quot;Don't worry - they often don't live long.&quot;

<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, 96% of carers reported their caring responsibilities have put a strain on them
with 87% reporting it has put a strain on their relationship with their spouse or partner and 85% reporting
it has put a strain on their family.  As one carer put it:

<p>&quot;I have lost friends, space to have a normal life, my daughter finds it hard to study, cannot
work. My marriage broke down. My husband left after 25 years of marriage.&quot;

<p>Carers also feel it is extremely difficult to get the support they need, with 83% reporting  they 
have to fight for every service and 82% feeling that the majority of services lack awareness 

<p>of autism or Asperger syndrome.  This was backed up by the findings from the survey of the general
public, with only 7% of those who had heard of autism feeling people with autism receive enough support.
As one parent commented:  

<p> &quot;...education, doctors, paediatricians, speech therapists all (said) there (was) nothing wrong,
that he does not have problems. Asperger syndrome was not diagnosed until he was 16 years old. No
outside support for my son until recently - never having any support for myself or my family.&quot;

<p>'Beyond Rain Man' shows that 96% of the general public have not heard of Asperger syndrome and 35%
have not heard of autism. Whilst it may seem encouraging that 65% have heard of autism, many of these
people were apparently unaware of some of the main characteristics of the condition - e.g. 72% are
unaware it involves obsessive behaviours; 69% are unaware it involves temper tantrums in children and
77% are unaware it involves resistance to change in routine. 

<p>It is seven years since the film 'Rain Man' brought the attention of a wide audience to the condition of
autism. However, it is forty years since autism and Asperger syndrome (a form of autism) were officially
diagnosed. The film certainly helped to raise awareness of the condition; however, it would have been
impossible for the film to present a full picture of the complexity of autistic spectrum disorders.  For
instance, whilst some people with autism do have special abilities, such as those displayed by Raymond,
Dustin Hoffman's character in the film, they comprise a relatively small number - about one in twenty. 
Autistic spectrum disorders are not rare - over 320,000 people in the UK have the condition, which is a
life-long disability.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Swedish Development Cooperation</h3>



Official Swedish bilateral and multilateral development cooperation started in the early 1950s, based on a

humanitarian tradition of aid to European countries during World War II, on a strong missionary tradition,

and in the 1960s and 1970s, on many solidarity movements with newly independent countries. The first

Minister of Development Cooperation was appointed in 1954. Public and Parliamentary support for the high

level of development assistance has always been strong. However, since 1991 the political consensus has

been challenged by right wing politicians. This is countered by large media supported information

campaigns by the Government and NGOs. The public, many non-governmental organisations and solidarity

groups, political parties and their youth organisations, and professional organisations are actively and

critically involved in development cooperation.

<p>

In 1968 Sweden set itself a budget target of 1 per cent of GNP, that was actually reached in 1974. This

meant a steady increase in available funds over the years, which sometimes resulted in underspending. Net

official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 2 460 million, which was 1.03 per cent of GNP. In

response to domestic economic constraints the cooperation budgets for 1993 and 1994 have been cut to 0.97

per cent of GNP. Multilateral assistance remains around one-third of the total aid programme. Like other

Nordic countries, Sweden is an important donor to UN institutions, a growing proportion is contributed to

the World Bank and IDA.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Development cooperation in Sweden is ruled by law. In 1962 Parliament approved a law for development

cooperation policy, accompanied by a detailed statement on its objectives. This has been followed over the

years by several specific laws for different components and programmes of development cooperation. The

basic objectives, however, have never been changed. 

<p>

The Minister for Development Cooperation, within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), is responsible

for development cooperation policy. The present Minister is a member of the Cabinet. When no Minister for

Development Cooperation is appointed, which happened in the past, a State-Secretary under the MFA is

responsible. The development cooperation budget is not spread over other ministries. One of the three

departments at the MFA, the Department for International Cooperation under an Under-Secretary, is

responsible for supervising the aid programme. It has three divisions, one for policy formulation, planning

and cooperation with multilateral organisations, one for bilateral aid, and a policy planning and budgeting

division. Implementation of the bilateral programme is done by a number of rather independent government

funded agencies under the administration of the MFA. Although over the years several proposals for re-

organisation of the aid administration have been made, some of which have been realised, the general

structure and the basic allocation of responsibilities have not been changed substantially. Presently, a

proposal is made for the merger of the four main implementing agencies: SIDA, BITS, SAREC and

SWEDECORP. A similar proposal was rejected in 1986. Swedish ministries are generally small, they work

through larger implementing agencies.  

<p>

The main executing agency is the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), covering

approximately two-thirds of the cooperation budget. SIDA is the oldest and largest implementing agency,

started in 1965. It is responsible for bilateral aid to the programme countries, including financial aid,

recruiting of Swedish experts and NGO-activities. SIDA has field offices in the recipient countries; it sub-

contracts consultants, private organisations and research institutes. The organisation is governed by a 14

member Board, including representatives from political parties, trade unions, NGOs, industry, SIDA and the

MFA. Members of the Board are also on the Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Parliament. 

<p>

The Swedish Agency for Research Cooperation with Developing Countries (SAREC), started in 1975 as an

advisory council for the MFA and was installed in 1979 in its present independent form. SAREC supports

research in developing countries and international research programmes. It focuses on four broad areas:

public health, natural resources and the environment, natural science and technology, and political science. 

<p>

The third agency is the Swedish Agency for International Technical and Economic Cooperation (BITS) that

started in the 1980s. BITS was designed to promote economic and social development in developing

countries and to strengthen Swedish relations with the non-programme countries in particular. It administers

amongst others technical cooperation, mixed credits, and international training programmes. 

<p>

The Swedish International Enterprise Development Cooperation (SWEDECORP) was established in 1991

when Swedfund (for the promotion of joint ventures), and the import promotion office for products from

developing countries (IMPOD), together with parts of the industrial division of SIDA were merged.

SWEDECORP provides services in these three areas: the promotion of imports, the promotion of business

environment, and investments (mainly for joint ventures).

<p>

Three other government related institutes execute a number of specific tasks: the Swedish Institute promotes

cultural exchange activities; the Nordic Institute of African Studies conducts a research and fellowship

programme for Africa, in cooperation with Finland and the Institute for Development Education advises the

Government and trains Swedish development workers.

 

Policy planning is done by the Policy Planning Division at the MFA and by the General Policy Bureau of

SIDA. Since SIDA reports directly to the Government and the Parliament, its contribution to policy

preparation is considerable. Contacts with the MFA for policy coordination evidently exist. Policy planning

is assisted by studies by consultants, research institutes - government related and independent - and NGOs. 

<p>

Policy coordination for development cooperation is mainly an internal affair of the MFA, since the foreign

policy components of all ministries are managed and coordinated by this Ministry. Foreign policy, trade

policy and development cooperation policy are closely integrated. Interministerial consultations take place

between the MFA and the Ministry of Agriculture that handles specific aspects of environmental policy, and

the Ministry of Education that is responsible for the relations with UNESCO. 

<p>

In 1992 the Secretariat for Analysis of Swedish Development Assistance (SASDA) was installed. The

secretariat is located at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it has no formal organising and administrative

links with the Ministry. The secretariat, consisting of a small and independent group of people, is installed

by the Parliament for a two year period. Its very broad mandate includes the study on the effectiveness and

efficiency of Swedish development cooperation, strategic issues and on methodology. SASDA will present a

concluding report on twenty individual studies in September 1994.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

Generally speaking, implementing agencies in Scandinavian countries have a 'styrelse', a steering committee

or 'Board' with a limited number of members, and a 'radet', a much larger 'council'. Although both

institutions have an advisory mandate only, they have great influence, due to the representative composition

of their membership and high status. Boards usually include members of Parliament and officials of the

administration.

<p>

All Swedish agencies have an Advisory Board, of which the members are partly nominated by the Minister.

The Boards' positions differ. SIDA's Board, chaired by the agency's Director-General, limits itself to broad

policy questions, meets monthly, and its 14 members represent Parliament, NGOs, solidarity committees,

farmers organisations and cooperatives. There used to be a separate Advisory Council for SIDA, consisting

of 60 - 70 members. The task of SAREC's Board, placed above the SAREC's Director-General, is to

review all major funding proposals. 

<p>

Until the beginning of the 1990s a Nordic Council of the Ministers of Development Cooperation of

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden met bi-annually to discuss policy issues. Adjacent to these

meetings advisory meetings were organised of parliamentarians and researchers from the five countries. One

of these advisory meetings was a seminar Human Rights and Democracy held in Helsinki. The proceedings

were published in English. It is not known whether these meetings will be continued.

<p>

Development Cooperation policy is considerably influenced by Parliament. It decides about policy choices

and the volume of aid to be allocated to the main aid categories and countries. The budget and annual report

are presented to Parliament and actively discussed, in Parliament as well as in the Standing Committee for

Foreign Affairs. Parliament also lays down the frameworks for development assistance by determining the

objectives and the organisational structure. Over the years it installed several Commissions to examine

specific questions concerning the management of development cooperation.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

One-fourth of Swedish bilateral assistance is disbursed through private channels. When budget cuts were

implemented in 1993, support to NGOs and emergency aid were excluded. Traditionally there has been a

very close relationship between the Government and the numerous Swedish NGOs, that have a very long

tradition. Forty NGOs in 1952 formed the Committee for Technical Assistance to Less Developed

Countries, the predecessor of the present SIDA. Apart from specific development NGOs, the churches,

trade unions, solidarity committees, municipalities, women organisations, civil rights movements (some

dating back to 1900), cooperatives and vocational organisations cooperate with their respective counterparts

in the South. All NGOs are eligible for government assistance; some 600 NGOs receive government

support. There is no formal body representing all NGOs to the Government. There are around 14 umbrella-

type NGOs that have framework agreements with SIDA, for instance the International Trade Union

Cooperation (LOTCO), the Olof Palme International Centre and the Swedish Missionary Council. The

Government has formed a Council of Popular Movements, an informal structure for consultations with the

MFA. Subjects for discussion with the Government are: financial dependency, direct funding, capacity

building of local NGOs, and maintaining public support for development cooperation.

<p>

Independent and government related research institutes cooperate strongly with the Government and its aid

agencies for policy preparation, implementation and evaluation. In addition to the institutes already

mentioned, there are 17 institutes that according to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey qualify as Development

Research and Training Institutes.

<HR>

This report should be cited as: ECDPM. 1996. <i>Beyond Lom&#233; IV: Exploring Options for Future ACP-EU Cooperation</i>. (Policy Management Report No. 6). Maastricht: European Centre for Development Policy Management.

<p><hr><p>

<I>"The 'Beyond-Lom&#233; IV' debate in fact invites us to fundamentally rethink the nature

of our cooperation and the ways to design and implement it" (EU official)</I>.

<p>

The process of rethinking Lom&#233; has just began. The current Convention runs out on

29 February, 2000. Eighteen months before Lom&#233; IV expires (i.e. on 1 September

1998) negotiations will formally start "to examine what conditions shall subsequently govern

relations between the Community and the Member States on the one hand and the ACP

States on the other hand" (Article 366, 3 of the Convention).

<p>

This means that less than two years are available to properly prepare for these negotiations.

This is a relatively short period of time, if we take into account the "information deficit" on

Lom&#233; matters, the need for extensive consultation and dialogue at different levels, and

the complexity of redesigning a twenty-year old cooperation agreement.  

<p>

With its <A HREF="../lome/postl_gb.htm">programme on "Beyond-Lom&#233; IV"</A>, ECDPM sought to reduce the information

gap and to stimulate fresh thinking, particularly in ACP countries. With this report, it hopes

to contribute to a better understanding of the main issues at stake in the process of rethinking

Lom&#233; taking into account the fears and expectations of different stakeholders, and the

possible reform options.

<p>

In this final chapter, we provide some pointers for those who want to influence the rapidly

evolving debate on the future of ACP-EU cooperation. 

<p>



<H3>An Informed Debate Can Make a Difference</H3>

<p>

As mentioned before, ACP representatives from different walks of life, are very sceptical, if

not pessimistic, on the chances of a fair debate. They fear that "Europe had already made

up its mind" with regard to the ACP and that consultation and dialogue will not change this.

<p>



The current political climate in Europe may nurture such beliefs. Yet it is our firm conviction

that an informed debate  can make a difference. Much could be achieved if ACP

governments join the debate with a different mindset than in the past. This means moving

beyond "business-as-usual" and the mere defence of the "acquis." It implies accepting a

different type of partnership, based on the best elements of the "Lom&#233; culture"

(recipient responsibility, dialogue and predictability) while incorporating a new set of basic

principles that reflect EU priorities and concerns (such as performance related aid,

accountability, transparency, institutional pluralism). 

<p>

The ACP private sector has much to gain from an active participation in the debate. They

are well-placed to make proposals as to how future cooperation could better address their

needs, including the design of new instruments. Civil society organisations could also make

a dent, if they can mobilise their constituencies and organise themselves for advocacy work.

In the Treaty of Maastricht, the EU has legally committed itself to combating poverty,

promoting sustainable development and ensuring the integration of developing countries in

the world economy. These legal provisions offer a perfect "entry point" for serious advocacy

work in favour of the developing countries currently associated to the Lom&#233;

Convention.

<p>



<H3>Hard Evidence and Research are Vital</H3>

<p>

This is not the time for "policy-making without facts." Exhortations for international

solidarity or doomsday scenarios will not suffice. The best way to convince European

politicians and public opinion is to come up with policy proposals that are based on hard

evidence and solid research findings. Content-wise, the agenda is very broad. There is, for

instance, a major need to evaluate the past performance of the different Lom&#233;

instruments and for "balance sheets" that indicate the impact of the EDF on ACP

development (through country case studies, for example). It means research into the

consequences of trade liberalisation for ACP economies and social development. It means

serious analysis of the possible gains and benefits of a regionalisation of Lom&#233; and

related split of the ACP group. Research is also needed to design new mechanisms for

decentralising aid delivery (modalities for direct funding). Above all, it calls on the ACP

actors to work out their own ideas on future cooperation -- rather than simply reacting to

European proposals. From an organisational point of view, it requires that ACP research

capacity is mobilised and the result linked into the policy-making process. 

<p>

<H3>EU's Entire Development Policy is Up for Review</H3>

<p>

The different parties involved need to realise that this rethinking of Lom&#233; fits into

a broader, review of the EU's entire development policy. The Treaty of Maastricht provides

development cooperation with a legal foundation in the European construction. It defines

clear development objectives and calls for improved coordination, complementarity

(between the efforts of Member States and the Commission) and policy coherence. 

<p>

Much work is still to be done at the European level to sort out the implications of these

objectives for day-to-day practice. It will be important to keep abreast of policy changes in

this regard, as they may affect the future place and shape of ACP-EU cooperation.  

<p>

There is  also a need to watch the development of EU foreign policy in general, especially

in relation to the "Inter Governmental Conference" (that is currently reviewing the

Maastricht Treaty) and the envisaged enlargement of the Union (which is likely to have

major effects on ACP-EU cooperation). Lom&#233; countries are also well-advised to

analyse in detail how the EU has entered into cooperation agreements with other regions

(Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe). Different partnership arrangements, decision-

making procedures and financial mechanisms have been utilised in these schemes. For

instance, Lom&#233; is the last Convention in the EU's foreign relation programme to

contain a "contractual" commitment in the form of a financial protocol up to the year

2000. This seems to suggest that Lom&#233; will also be "de-contractualised."

<p>



<H3>Don't Forget the Member States</H3>

<p>

On the side of the Commission (DG VIII), there seems to be a genuine desire to openly

discuss the future of ACP-EU cooperation, without taboos and in a spirit of participation.

But what about the Member States? Their views and interests with regard to the future of

Lom&#233; diverge. Moreover, what is at stake is not just the renewal of development

cooperation with the ACP states, but the balance of power between national aid agencies

and the Commission. The compatibility between development concerns and the interests

of trade, industry and agriculture is also in the balance. All these suggest the need to ensure

proper communication and dialogue with Member States. It is critically important,

particularly for ACP bodies and European NGO's, to keep abreast of the thinking in the

different member states and to ensure their constructive involvement in rethinking

Lom&#233;.

<p>



<H3>Packaging the Message</H3>

<p>

A final suggestion is the need for a modern communication strategy. ACP actors, in

particular, are well-advised to develop a "marketing" strategy to bring their fears, interests

and expectations to the fore. If they want to strike a better deal with the EU, they will have

to "make their case." The Europeans and their Governments need to be convinced that

cooperation with the Lom&#233; countries is a good investment. ACP actors will need to

demonstrate that development cooperation remains a vital support to their own efforts, to

indicate what might happen to them (and the EU) if this type of cooperation is reduced,

removed or altered, to show how this cooperation can serve the aims and objectives of the

EU itself, and to offer guarantees that taxpayer's money can be properly used. 

<p>

This means that the ball is primarily in the ACP court. If they can deliver a strong and

convincing message, the chances of a positive EU response sharply increase. This would

open new perspectives for arriving at a mutually beneficial partnership relation, adapted to

the development challenges of the year 2000 and beyond.

<P>





Le groupe a pass&eacute; en revue les 4 s&eacute;ries de questions

inscrites &agrave; l'ordre du jour. Le d&eacute;bat a couvert

l'ensemble des questions pr&eacute;vues &agrave; l'ordre du jour,

bien que les conclusions tir&eacute;es ne cadraient pas n&eacute;cessairement

tr&egrave;s bien avec la rubrique de chaque sujet et qu'en outre,

elles ne sont pas pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es sous les m&ecirc;mes

intitul&eacute;s dans cette synth&egrave;se. Bien des points ont

fait l'objet d'un consensus m&ecirc;me si, naturellement, la discussion

avait tendance &agrave; se concentrer sur les sujets de d&eacute;saccord.

<P>

<H3><B>Les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences sont-elles efficaces?</B></H3>

<P>

Une discussion approfondie a port&eacute; sur l'efficacit&eacute;,

ou l'inefficacit&eacute;, des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences et de

nombreux exemples pratiques ont &eacute;t&eacute; cit&eacute;s

pour illustrer leurs effets positifs et leurs limites. Bien que

l'on n'ait pas obtenu une unit&eacute; de vues sur le sujet, un

large consensus a &eacute;t&eacute; recueilli selon lequel a)

certains pays ACP ont &eacute;t&eacute; capables de tirer parti

des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences de sorte que b) leur suppression

entra&icirc;nerait des co&ucirc;ts. Par cons&eacute;quent, le

groupe s'est entendu sur le fait qu'un certain type de r&eacute;gime

d'&eacute;changes pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiels devrait &ecirc;tre

&eacute;tendu au-del&agrave; de l'an 2000 et beaucoup ont estim&eacute;

qu'il devrait &ecirc;tre au moins aussi bon (et si possible meilleur)

que les acquis de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

De mani&egrave;re plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, on a estim&eacute;

que la croissance dans le domaine des &eacute;changes d&eacute;pendait

de l'acc&egrave;s au march&eacute; (couvert par le r&eacute;gime

des &eacute;changes de Lom&eacute; et peut-&ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute;

par des innovations telles qu'un syst&egrave;me de garantie et

de financement de l'exportation) mais aussi des capacit&eacute;s

d'offre (faisant d&eacute;faut dans certains pays ACP mais devant

constituer une priorit&eacute; d'action pour d'autres instruments).

Cette analyse a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e par

plusieurs membres du groupe qui soutenaient que Lom&eacute; devrait

contribuer &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration d'un cadre de r&egrave;gles

veillant &agrave; ce que les transactions commerciales soient

'&eacute;quitables' et garantissant que le commerce contribue

non seulement &agrave; la croissance, mais aussi au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<H3><B>Comment peut-on am&eacute;liorer leur impact?</B></H3>

<P>

Les questions cl&eacute;s sont les suivantes: comment am&eacute;liorer

les dispositions de Lom&eacute; concernant l'acc&egrave;s aux

march&eacute;s et comment assouplir les contraintes de l'offre

(la question des ressources humaines a &eacute;t&eacute; sp&eacute;cifiquement

mentionn&eacute;e) soit en se concentrant davantage sur les actions

d&eacute;j&agrave; autoris&eacute;es par la Convention, soit en

introduisant de nouveaux instruments. On a fait remarquer que

l'impact des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences n'est pas toujours clair.

On s'est accord&eacute; sur le fait qu'il n'existe pas de SOLUTION

unique permettant de r&eacute;soudre tous les aspects du probl&egrave;me

dans tous les pays ACP. Il est essentiel d'adopter une approche

diversifi&eacute;e vu la nature disparate du groupe. Des r&eacute;ponses

compl&egrave;tes n&eacute;cessitent de plus amples informations

sur ce qui a fonctionn&eacute;, ce qui n'a pas r&eacute;ussi et

pourquoi. Le principal sujet de discussion &eacute;tait: jusqu'&agrave;

quel point peut-on arriver &agrave; cette diff&eacute;rentiation

dans le cadre existant et  jusqu'&agrave; quel point cela n&eacute;cessite-t-il

un changement fondamental dans la relation UE-ACP. La discussion

est revenue &agrave; plusieurs reprises sur ce choix.

<P>

<H3><B>Comment g&eacute;rer au mieux les contraintes 'n&eacute;gatives' ?</B></H3>

<P>

Le groupe a tenu un long (et r&eacute;current) d&eacute;bat sur

la meilleure fa&ccedil;on d'aborder les obstacles au maintien

du statu quo, et plus particuli&egrave;rement, l'attitude de l'OMC.

L'avis g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &eacute;tait que:

<P>

* la Convention existante ne cadre pas tr&egrave;s bien avec les

r&egrave;gles actuelles de l'OMC;

<P>

* la situation actuelle laisse &agrave; d&eacute;sirer en ce qui

concerne la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; m&ecirc;me si elle pourrait

&ecirc;tre prolong&eacute;e apr&egrave;s l'an 2000;

<P>

* aucune des options actuelles destin&eacute;es &agrave; rendre

Lom&eacute; plus compatible avec l'OMC n'est d&eacute;nu&eacute;e

de probl&egrave;mes, entre autres parce que les r&egrave;gles

de l'OMC n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;dig&eacute;es dans

l'esprit d'un accord du style de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

Etant donn&eacute; ces points d'entente, le d&eacute;bat s'est

concentr&eacute; sur l'&eacute;valuation des pour et des contre

des diff&eacute;rentes modifications pouvant &ecirc;tre apport&eacute;es

aux accords actuels, et les d&eacute;saccords ont en grande partie

d&eacute;coul&eacute; des diff&eacute;rences dans l'appr&eacute;ciation

de l'importance de chacun d'eux. On a &eacute;galement observ&eacute;

une diff&eacute;rence en ce qui concerne le point auquel, s'ils

agissaient de concert, l'UE et les pays ACP pourraient fa&ccedil;onner

l'opinion de l'OMC afin de cr&eacute;er un cadre habilitant plus

appropri&eacute; que l'Article 24 sur les accords Nord-Sud entre

des &eacute;tats disparates. Mais on est arriv&eacute; &agrave;

un consensus sur le fait que l'OMC est avant tout un forum politique

dans lequel l'UE et les &eacute;tats ACP devraient vendre leurs

propositions, quelles qu'elles soient en fin de compte.

<P>

Une fa&ccedil;on de d&eacute;samorcer la critique selon laquelle

Lom&eacute; est discriminatoire serait de permettre une extension

du groupe des membres des ACP. On a sugg&eacute;r&eacute;, par

exemple, que des PMA non ACP pourraient se voir accorder les m&ecirc;me

concessions commerciales que celles qui sont de mise pour tous

dans le cadre de Lom&eacute;. Une telle disposition r&eacute;pondrait

aux critiques de ceux qui, au sein de l'UE, sont m&eacute;contents

de la concentration dans le groupe ACP des anciennes colonies

d'un petit nombre d'&eacute;tats membres.

<P>

La discussion a &eacute;galement comport&eacute; un &eacute;change

de vues anim&eacute; portant sur l'importance de la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;

dans le processus visant &agrave; rendre le r&eacute;gime plus

compatible avec l'OMC. Cela s'est fondu dans un examen plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral

des avantages et des inconv&eacute;nients de la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;.

On a soutenu que la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; serait favorable

aux &eacute;tats ACP en ce sens qu'elle apporterait les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices

&eacute;conomiques que certains associent &agrave; la lib&eacute;ralisation,

mais aussi qu'il s'agissait d'un &eacute;l&eacute;ment important

dans le processus cens&eacute; rendre Lom&eacute; compatible avec

l'OMC. Les partisans de l'autre point de vue &eacute;taient d'avis

que les gains en efficacit&eacute; &eacute;taient g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement

associ&eacute;s &agrave; une lib&eacute;ralisation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale

pour tous les partenaires commerciaux et non pas &agrave; une

ouverture partielle &agrave; l'un d'entre eux seulement, et qu'en

outre, le lien entre la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; et  l'OMC n'&eacute;tait

pas clairement &eacute;tabli. Il existait un danger que la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;

soit trop faible pour soutenir un cas expos&eacute; dans le cadre

de l'Article 24 de l'OMC (parce que cela ne concernerait que quelques

pays ACP). Une r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; totale au sein du groupe

ACP dans son ensemble (c.&agrave;.d. libre &eacute;change entre

tous les membres) &eacute;tait irr&eacute;alisable politiquement

et l'objectif moins ambitieux de libre &eacute;change entre chaque

pays ACP et l'UE amoindrirait la coh&eacute;sion du groupe.

<P>

<H3><B>Comment g&eacute;rer au mieux les stimuli 'positifs' pour le

changement?</B></H3>

<P>

Une adh&eacute;sion beaucoup plus large a &eacute;t&eacute; not&eacute;e

en ce qui concerne les avantages que comporte la cr&eacute;ation

d'un cadre permettant &agrave; certaines r&eacute;gions ACP d'aller

plus loin que d'autres dans leurs accords commerciaux avec l'UE

et de consentir des 'concessions' mutuelles qui incluraient la

r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;. Une sorte d'approche '&agrave; la carte'

de la relation a obtenu un soutien assez important, mais l'entente

&eacute;tait moindre au sujet de ce qui devrait &ecirc;tre propos&eacute;.

Un point de vue qui a rencontr&eacute; un large soutien, mais

pas l'unanimit&eacute;, fut que les acquis devraient constituer

une plate-forme accessible &agrave; tous et qu'en outre, on pourrait

envisager une aide compl&eacute;mentaire dont la forme varierait

en fonction des besoins des sous-groupes particuliers. Par exemple,

les PMA pourraient avoir besoin d'un suppl&eacute;ment d'aide

pour am&eacute;liorer leurs capacit&eacute;s d'offre tandis que

des &eacute;tats plus comp&eacute;titifs gagneraient &agrave;

b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier d'un meilleur acc&egrave;s, par exemple

sur le plan des services et de l'investissement.

<P>

A la fin de la journ&eacute;e, une tentative d'organiser les options

de mani&egrave;re sch&eacute;matique a cr&eacute;&eacute; autant

de confusion que de clart&eacute; mais cela constitue une approche

pr&eacute;cieuse pour clarifier les choix devant &ecirc;tre pos&eacute;s

et sur lesquels on pourrait se fonder. Il faut en outre rassembler

des informations plus concr&egrave;tes sur les types 'd'accords

additionnels'.

<h4>This Report</h4>

The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.

<p>

The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.

<p>

This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 30 March 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.

<h4>Main Points</h4>

The report reviews the volume and distribution of French aid, noting that France ranks third in absolute volume of overseas development assistance, with aid accounting for 0.63 per cent of gross national product.

<p>

This report is mainly concerned with French bilateral assistance. It is centred on the consequences of the CFA Franc for the countries affected; aid effectiveness; implmentation of the DAC principles for effective aid; and the French administration's capacity for follow-up evaluation; aid objectives and management systems; French assistance to "women in development" and "population"; and finally, cooperation of the aid administration with French NGO's.

<p>

An important change in French aid management policy that is highlighted is the move away from technical assistance based on substitution to cooperation based on partnership. In this, recipients assume greater responsibility for management.

<p>

The current aid system is very complex with many ministries involved in shaping and managing bilateral aid. This tends to produce complexity in the targets and management of French cooperation and it risks reducing effectiveness. However, reforms to streamline management and improve internal coordination are in progress; and systematic ex post evaluation is being introduced in an effort to increase effectiveness.

<p>

The report notes that discussions are ongoing to see how NGO's can be more involved in the framing and implementation of French development cooperation.

<h1>Mauritian melee</h1>

<font size=+1><b><i>by Lindsey Collen</i>
</b></font><p>


Caught between rival Hindu and Muslim fundamentalism, free speech in Mauritius is in danger of falling victim to the struggle for economic and political power between contending factions.<p>


The attacks by Muslim fundamentalists against Namassiwayam Ramalingum and his paper, L'Independant (Index 3/1995), illustrate only one aspect of a more widespread malaise in Mauritian society. 
Mauritius has seen vast changes over the past 15 years. Since 1979, it has been paraded as one of the IMF and World Bank's economic -success stories'.<p>

Socially it is a different story: the island, best known as an idyllic resort for international tourists, has become tense and ill-at-ease with itself. <p>

A road accident in May on the main motorway just outside the capital, Port Louis, for example, led to six hours of rioting. It was directed against any form of authority in sight and even when they opened fire on the rioters, the police had difficulty controlling the mob. Within hours, the riot showed signs of developing into a communal affair. The Hindu-Muslim divide that forms the basis of communalism here as in India, is increasingly taking on a fundamentalist tone. This dual-fundamentalism is further complicated by the presence of a substantial Christian community. 
Tensions between communities have  been exacerbated in recent years by political and economic factors.<p>

The June state visit of the leader of the Indian opposition, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), combined official tours of state institutions with visits to a number of Hindu religious organisations. The Mauritian government was involved in planning this unprecedented mix of official and personal meetings. <p>

The growth of the Muslim fundamentalist party, the Hisbullah, has been accompanied by increased political activity. A series of demands on the political front culminated in its denunciation of L'Independant for alleged attacks on the Prophet and threats of violence against its editor. The paper's demands for the liberalisation of meat imports had more to do with economics than religion. <p>

The hierarchy of the Catholic Church of Mauritius is conservative to a degree. It is one of the few institutions in the world never to have taken a stand against apartheid; the Bishop's Lent message took issue with the government tax on the sugar barons. It has recently refused to implement anti-discrimination regulations on staffing and students in the schools it controls but which depend on public funding.<p>

But growing communal feeling and the various fundamentalisms conceal more crude conflicts. The switch to economic privatisation means great prizes are to be had. Those in the running are different sections of a ruthless bourgeoisie. Not everyone can win and privatisation means conflict as goods and services recently owned and controlled by the state are handed over to the 'old' money represented by just a few families, usually the ones that owned and controlled them before independence, before universal suffrage.<p>

Other would-be winners in the privatisation handout can succeed only to the extent that they can enlist the deadly -isms' on their side. This is all-out war for the enrichment of a few.<p>

Fed with propaganda about Mauritius' success - a model for Africa, the tiger of the Indian Ocean and so on - most Mauritians wonder what's going on. All they see of the Mauritian miracle is the growing spectre of increasingly insecure jobs, sweatshop conditions, compulsory overtime as low-paid factory workers (US $100 a month), prices no longer controlled, sugar mills closing down, a housing shortage, threats of privatised health, education, electricity and water.<p>

So what do the attacks on L'Independant, supposedly unleashed by outraged Muslim sensibilities, have to do with all this? The paper, the precise ownership of which remains unclear, represents the interests of one group competing in the privatisation stakes who thought to advance its cause by taking over the Ministry of Finance, the department in charge of privatisation. In its bid for the political power that would give them the economic edge, it had no scruples about manipulating Hindu and Tamil communalism. <p>

L'Independant combined scurrilous rumours with some genuine exposes of important financial scandals - both of which led to an increase in its circulation. It was equally up front in its defence of 'Hindu power'; many felt that the victims of its character assassinations were often chosen because they were Muslims. The newspaper also carried scurrilous attacks against me and my novel The Rape of Sita (Index 4&5/1994).<p>

None of which warrants the violence unleashed against the paper by Muslim extremists: public burnings, public threats, fire-bombs at the printers. These were followed a week later by the equally disturbing spectacle of orators defending L'Independant burning three other newspapers - L'Express, Le Mauricien and Le Mag - for being 'anti-Hindu'. The mainstream press is still effectively owned and controlled by a Euro-centred Catholic elite. This burning of newspapers took place at the celebration of a religious festival at a new building called 'Hindu House' and in the presence of official advisers to the prime minister. One of the first organisations to be associated with this new Hindu centre was the Hindu Business Council.<p>

While communalism and fundamentalism have been enlisted to serve the economic interests of the few, for the majority they represent the politics of despair. In March, however, the Movement Against Communalism (MAC) was founded to counteract this madness. It is potentially strong, including the whole of the trade union movement, consumers' groups, environmentalists, the women's movement, almost all musicians in the country, pre-school playgroup organisers, adult literacy groups, a health co-operative, an agricultural organisation, and an organisation of the blind - as well as many individuals. MAC rejects all forms of classification or categorisation of people along communal, ethnic or religious lines. It exposes institutionalised communalism - in laws, in organisational forms - and opposes all links between organised religions and politics. And it defends freedom of expression.<p>

The vested interests that resort to communalism, racism and religious strife are, among so much else, the enemies of free expression. <p>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Italian Development Cooperation</h3>



Official Italian development cooperation started in the 1960s, and was based on considerations of foreign

policy, of which development cooperation forms an integral part. Public support was strong in the 1980s,

but is now declining, apparently under influence of the revelations about management deficiencies and the

existence of parallel political and economic circuits. Reform measures that have been prepared already,

might restore the credibility of the aid organisation. 

<p>

The Government has proposed measures to identify problems and to introduce reforms in the conception,

planning, implementation and organisation of Italy's aid programme. A Special Commission of Experts was

installed in 1992 to examine the programme. In its report to Parliament in February 1993 it has suggested

fundamental changes with regard to the distribution of presently overlapping competencies of government

institutions, simplifying the current complicated administrative procedures, strengthening capacities and

expertise for planning, implementation and evaluation, procurement rules, as well as loosening the narrow

linkages between aid and foreign policy, trade and other national Italian interests, and improving policy

coordination between ministries.

<p>

Italian net official development assistance in 1992 amounted to US $ 4 122 million, which was 0.34 per cent

of GNP. Since the mid-1980s the ODA/GNP ratio had risen notably, reaching 0.42 per cent in 1989. In the

years thereafter actual disbursements fell, which resulted in large amount of undisbursed aid funds.

However, one should bear in mind that figures from different sources may disagree. Aid allocations for the

years 1993 - 1995 are projected to decline further to 0.20 per cent of expected GNP. The proportion of

Italian multilateral aid was always about 40 per cent of ODA, consisting mainly of compulsory

contributions. These rose in 1992 to 14 per cent of ODA to the EU, and to 27 per cent of ODA to other

multilateral organisations.

<p>

The proposed reductions in the total budget have to be borne mainly by the bilateral programme. One of the

reasons for the reductions, imposed by Parliament, was the apparent lack of capacity of the administration to

manage the growing number of projects in the past years. It is doubtful whether these commitments,

together with a decreasing budget, will leave much room for new policies and new projects in the coming

years. 

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Italian aid policy remains at present based on an Act from 1987 that established development cooperation as

part of Italian foreign policy, and that refers to the principles of solidarity among peoples, and of human

rights laid down by the UN and confirmed by the Lom&#233; Conventions. The 1987 law also shaped the

administrative structure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for development cooperation. The

central unit for the management of Italy's aid programme is the Directorate-General of Development

Cooperation (DGCS) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The DGCS has 19 offices. Three Undersecretaries

of State assist the Minister of Foreign Affairs, one of which handles development cooperation. His position

does not appear to be a strong one. This Undersecretary is also in charge of policies in several other areas.

<p>

The directorate DGCS is also in charge of aid implementation. However, due to lack of capacities at the

DGCS and the embassies, implementation in recipient countries is left to a large extent to private

enterprises, consultants and NGOs.

<p>

Apart from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs three other ministries are involved in development cooperation:

the Treasury, the Ministry of the Budget and Economic Planning, and Ministry of Foreign Trade, the latter

through the Medium Term Loan Bank and the Bank of Italy. Allocations of responsibilities are not known. 

<p>

The law of 1987 created two interministerial committees for decision making as well as a Consultative

Committee. The Interministerial Committee for Development Cooperation (CICS) is chaired by the Minister

of Foreign Affairs, and comprises the Ministers of the Budget and Economic Planning, of Foreign Trade,

and of the Treasury. The CICS mainly sets priorities for the geographical and sectoral distributions of aid.

The second committee, the Steering Committee (or Directing Committee) decides on the allocations of the

annual amount of aid, within the framework established by CICS. The Steering Committee is chaired by the

Under-Secretary for Development Cooperation, and consists of the Directors-General of the same ministries

that are represented in the CICS, and of members of the Consultative Committee.

<p>

Since Italy traditionally has intensive trade relations with developing countries, the Interministerial

Committee for Foreign Economic Policy (CIPES) also plays an important role. After a reorganisation in

1990, a second reorganisation of the aid administration is currently under way, which includes new

mechanisms of interministerial coordination.  

<p>

Systematic planning of country programmes is absent. Bilateral cooperation is based until now on

negotiations with recipient countries. There is no system for regular ex post evaluation. External institutions

have carried out some evaluations, mainly focusing on disbursement aspects. Due to lack of staff, it is

difficult at the moment to integrate evaluation findings into aid management. Proposal are being made for

the establishment of an Evaluation Unit. 

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

The Consultative Committee on International Cooperation is a consultative body chaired by the Minister of

Foreign Affairs or the Under-Secretary in charge of development cooperation. The Committee has 45

members: five experts appointed by the NGOs, three by the major trade union confederations; ten members

are appointed by institutions and private enterprises operating in development cooperation; five members

belong to the public sector, and five to the private sector; three members are appointed by the Interregional

Commission - representing Italian Regions; one expert is appointed by the National Universities Council,

and one by the National Research Council; one expert represents the Overseas Agronomic Institute, nine

experts represent the State Administrations - civil servants of other ministries involved in development

cooperation - and lastly, both the Director General for Development Cooperation and the Director General

for Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are members of the Committee. Members are

appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, following the nomination of the organisations and institutions.

<p>

It is the task of the Consultative Committee to formulate and express opinions about the planning and the

measures elaborated by the Steering Committee, and about the annual report of the CICS. Exerting one of

its tasks, the Consultative Committee informed Parliament in December 1993 that it could not approve the

Annual Report 1992 of the CICS because of a general scarcity of data, and insufficient explanations on the

policies pursued.

<p>

Until recently the Committee had hardly been consulted by the Government. It seems however, that with the

revision of the aid programme and its management, the Committee obtained more relevance. In 1993 it has

established several new working groups for various sections of cooperation. The Government has stated the

intention to take the results of the Committee's work into account. 

<p>

Until recently the role of Parliament in discussing development cooperation has been very limited. Annually

it voted the funds for the aid budget. Discussions on aid programme policies or planning did not take place.

Recently Parliamentarians appear to take more interest in the use of funds and the planning of programmes.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

There are many, relatively small, NGOs in Italy. About 120 organisations are eligible for Government co-

funding of their development activities. Another 35 organisation requested that status. Many more

organisations do not seek such status. Private fund raising from the Italian public represents only 12 per cent

(1989-1991) of their total income; the remainder originates from the EU, churches, municipalities, and other

ministries then the MFA. Government funding for NGO activities has been severely curtailed in the years

1992-1993, and sometimes stopped altogether.

<p>

There are no umbrella organisations acting as representatives of their members in dialogue with the

Government. The main vehicle for the policy dialogue is the Consultative Committee, in which NGOs are

represented. There are a number of NGO networks, such as the Catholic Federation Christian Organisations

for International Voluntary Service (FOCSIV), the secular urban based Coordination International

Organisations for Development (COCIS), and the Coordination of International Solidarity People Initiatives

(CIPSI) with small, mainly Catholic NGOs. The Consultative Committee has a working group for NGOs,

chaired by a NGO representative. The working group advises, among other things, the Minister of Foreign

Affairs on eligibility of NGOs. This membership allows the NGO representative to participate in the work

of the interministerial Steering Committee. NGOs participate currently in the discussion on new policies and

structure of development cooperation. Although some structures for policy dialogue do exist, and many

government projects and policy concepts originate from NGO thinking and their partnership relations in the

Third World, the formal and recognised influence of NGOs does not appear to be considerable.

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey, 38 institutes in Italy qualify as Development Research and

Training Institutes, some of which are known to be involved in consultancy work for the Government, or to

undertake policy studies. The Centre for Studies in International Politics (CeSPI), an independent research

institute, in 1991 presented a paper with criteria for a new government policy, during an international

conference in Rome, organised by the Government. The Institute for International Economic Cooperation

and Development (ICEPS) provides information on economic cooperation and development, and fosters

Italian initiatives abroad, especially in developing countries. It is composed of prominent members from

politics, culture and private enterprise. 

<p>

As explained the Italian business community appears well represented in various aid institutions until now,

and its interests are integrated in development policy. However, the business community also feels the need

for reforms in the organisation and procedures of aid. A study by the Directorate for Technical Cooperation

of the IRI, the main industrial state holding company, stressed in 1992 inter alia the need for overhauling

the DGCS.

<h1>Deadly ambition</h1>

<font size=+1><b>Bacilli and viruses live for fame and stardom. Every young germ aspires to bring down a Liberace or to be chased by Dustin Hoffman on the silver screen.</b></font><p>



So pity the poor, ordinary tuberculosis bacillus. This boring bug has been around for millennia. It's been found in ancient Egyptian mummies and in the bones of South Americans who lived in 3000 BC.<p>

Tuberculosis has seen better days. Mycobacterium tuberculosis used to be the disease of celebrities, killing off legions of famous poets, writers and musicians. Kafka, Thoreau, Keats, Poe, Orwell, Chekov and Chopin were all afflicted with the disease. It was the AIDS epidemic of our grandparents' generation with an added terror: this incurable disease travelled through the air.<p>

But then, about 35 years ago, scientists discovered an almost perfect cure. If administered properly, this combination of medicines proved to be nearly 100-per-cent effective in

obliterating TB bacilli from the lungs. The entire course of treatment -known as Ôdirectly observed treatment, short-course', or DOTS -now costs as little as $13 in some parts of the world. It is considered to be one of the world's most cost-effective public-health interventions. <p>

It seemed that TB's career was over for good. <br>
But don't believe the reviews. The drugs have yet to be put to exten sive use throughout the world. Consequently, the TB epidemic never went away and has actually worsened, killing millions each year.  <p>

So why are people surprised to learn that TB kills more children, teens and adults than any other infectious disease? Why do they shake their heads in disbelief when they discover that TB kills many times the number of people who die from AIDS each year? Why are they shocked to discover that a third of the world's population -nearly two billion people -are infected with the TB bacillus? Why has this terrible germ still not been featured in a Benetton ad?<p>

To answer these questions, we decided to ask the TB bacilli themselves. Through new-and otherwise useless -technology funded by a $2.5 billion grant from the National Institute of Health, it is now possible to communicate with TB bacilli.<p>


<hr width=71%>

<h3>TB Bacilli agree to talk to Johannes Chlamydia on the eve of their world tour</h3>



<b>NI:</b> We are surprised to find you here. Everyone told us that you had gone away.<br>
<b>Doug the Bug:</b> That's a big myth. Every year we and our friends kill nearly three million humans. In the past decade we've caused over 80 million people to be sick, cough up blood and suffer with fever. We've been hard at work, but nobody pays any attention to our tragic performances.<br>
<b>Sherm the Germ: </b>Yeh, our old friends, The Plague, travelled to India and killed 54 people last year. They caused pandemonium and mass 
evacuation.<br>
<b>Doug the Bug: </b>The Ebolas visited Zaire and were an instant front-page success. During the time it took them to kill just 200 people we extinguished a quarter of a million lives. But nobody noticed us.<br>
<b>Phyllis the Bacillus:</b> That's because Ebola bleeds them from the outside. The camera crews love it. We only bleed them to death from the inside.<p>

<b>NI: </b>So fame continues to elude you? <br>
<b>Kim the Mycobacterium: </b>We think we have figured out why our careers have hit hard times. Nine out of ten of us live in economically developing countries. Life is easy there and nobody hassles us. Many of those countries haven't invested in the effective and ridiculously cheap TB-control systems that can make our lives miserable. China, Tanzania, Vietnam and Nicaragua are among the few exceptions. I pity the poor bugs still trying to live there.<br>
<b>Doug the Bug: </b>So the problem is, although we're causing lots of suffering, nobody pays any attention to our horrendous accomplishments in the South. No media coverage, no charity auctions and no protest marches. Nothing! It's as if we don't exist.<br>

<b>Phyllis the Bacillus: </b>We decided we'd have to work harder to recapture the spotlight. We're doing a lot more travelling and trying to get booked in more cosmopolitan locations. The world is smaller now and it's easier to get around.<p>

<b>NI: </b>What are your travel plans? <br>
<b>Phyllis the Bacillus:</b> Romania for me. The deterioration of Eastern Europe's healthcare systems following the collapse of socialism is an open invitation to make a prolonged visit. Then it's on to Germany.<br>
<b>Sherm the Germ:</b> I've been in England recently. Last Christmas I spent hours suspended, floating around in Heathrow, just waiting for someone with tickets to Bali or Honolulu to pass by and breathe me in. Instead I ended up in Birmingham. <br>
<b>Doug the Bug: </b>I hear the United States is fun. Any country without a national healthcare system is an attractive place to raise a family. Besides, the dollar is quite favourable right now.<p>

<br clear=all><p>


<b>NI:</b> Why is it that most governments and aid agencies don't seem to take you very seriously and continue to allow you to go about your own business?<br>
<b>Phyllis the Bacillus: </b>That's because we suffer from an additional image problem. Not only are we found primarily in developing countries, but most of our victims are poor people. They can't afford TB medicine or proper treatment.<br>
<b>Doug the Bug: </b>But we are in the process of trying to change that. We're beginning to recognize that it's not how many people you kill, but who you kill that's important.<br>
<b>Sherm the Germ:</b> Exactly! The London press ignored us when we infected hundreds of homeless people. Only when we infected a few badgers on the Prince of Wales' estate did they start talking about us.<p>

<b>NI: </b>So you intend to attack more celebrities?<br>

<b>Yvonne the Infection</b>: We've been infecting sports stars, movie stars, musicians and politicians for years. The problem is, when they get sick they can easily afford treatment. Likewise, the lite members of governments aren't personally worried about us. Cancer or heart attacks worry them more. They spend public money on expensive medical equipment and hospitals to take care of the diseases that threaten themselves and their families. So far, knock on wood, they've continued to ignore the inexpensive strategies that could put us out of business for good.<br>
Phyllis the Bacillus: But we think we've found a way to recapture the spotlight.
<b>Doug the Bug: </b>We've been working real hard at becoming drug-resistant! Once the middle and lite classes can no longer cure us, they'll make a great deal of commotion and we'll be back in vogue.<p>

<b>NI:</b> How do you intend to accomplish this?<br>
<b>Kim the Mycobacterium: </b>TB bacilli throughout the world have learned how to hide in specific parts of the lungs during treatment. If the patient doesn't faithfully take all of his or her medicines for the entire six months, our strongest germs can survive in these hiding places and multiply in new Ômultidrug-resistant' forms. The same medicines will no longer be effective the next time around. Then our new army of super bugs can fly out of the lungs and infect others when the host coughs, sneezes or even talks.<br>
<b>Phyllis the Bacillus:</b> Fortunately, most health workers don't watch to make certain their patients are really taking their medicines.<br>
<b>Yvonne the Infection: </b>So far our strategy has been very successful. We've become multidrug-resistant in thousands of people around the world, thanks to those governments who don't pay attention to treating us properly.<br>
<b>Phyllis the Bacillus: </b>And someday soon we'll get our first big celebrity victim.<br>
<b>Sherm the Germ: </b>Yes! Someone like Pavarotti! We'll have him bellowing out legions of deadly bacilli into the air when he sings!<br>
<b>Doug the Bug:</b> Imagine the headlines!<br>
<b>Sherm the Germ: </b>People wearing oxygen masks when they go out in public!<br>
<b>Doug the Bug: </b>Benefit concerts for the mTB on MTV!<br>
<b>Kim the Mycobacterium: </b>It will take at least a decade before researchers discover and test new medicines to fight multidrug-resistant TB.<br>
<b>Doug the Bug: </b>And even then we'll be safe. They'll make the same mistake and fail to properly provide these medicines to poor people.<p>

<center><b><font size=6 color=#990000>Yes, but what can I do?</font></b></center><BR>

<font size=4>There are lots of ways in which <b>YOU</b> can use less energy and use better energy.
They are also likely to save you money.</font><BR>
<BR><hr width=71%><p>


<h4>In the home</h4><ul>
<li>Temperature: Heating accounts for half the energy consumed in the home.
So the best - and simplest - thing you can do is turn it down.
Turning the thermostat down by just one degree will knock ten per cent off
your fuel bill. A maximum of 18 oC is usually adequate for most people.
Elderly people and infants may need 21 oC.<BR>
<li><b>Insulation:</b> Drafts account for 15-50 per cent of heat loss. Simple, relatively
cheap measures like putting draft excluders around windows and doors and
insulating the loft are often more effective than costlier options like
double-glazing. <BR>
<li><b> Environmental protection:</b>Passive solar heating - designing a building
so that it uses the sun's energy to warm it naturally - is obviously
the best. But if you are stuck with conventional means, then gas central-heating
is probably the least damaging, most efficient and cheapest. Oil is dirtier
than gas and incurs transport costs. Coal is the worst primary fuel for
global warming and acid rain and open coal fires are appallingly inefficient.
Electricity is expensive and is often uncleanly generated. The most environmentally-friendly
fuel you can use is wood from a sustainably-managed woodland.<BR>
<li> <b>Water heating:</b> Solar water heating is the most eco-friendly. Even in a
cool climate it can provide 40-60 per cent of hot water required for an
average house. Insulating hot water pipes also helps. But probably the biggest
saving you can make is to have showers instead of baths: they use just a
sixth of the water.<BR>
<li> <b>Appliances:</b> Gas appliances are almost always more efficient, cleaner and
cheaper to run than electrical ones. Microwave ovens use little energy compared
to a cooker - but any energy saving is totally lost if you buy frozen
convenience food to put in it. Pressure cookers are good and jug kettles
better than others. A good toaster is more efficient than a grill. <BR>
If buying a new refrigerator or freezer, check that it has good insulation,
is CFC-free, and isn't bigger than you need. Site away from heat sources.
Try switching it off in winter months.<BR>
When buying a washing machine, a side-filling type that has a half-load
setting and heats its own water is best. Gas tumble-driers are better than
electric. Dishwashers are expensive to buy and run, and should be used only
when full. <BR>
TVs, radios, hi-fi and computers use very little energy. Most of the energy
is used in making them. Rechargeable batteries for small appliances are
very much more environmentally sound.<BR>
<li> <b>Lighting:</b> Energy-saving lightbulbs are really worth having. One energy-saving
bulb lasts as long as eight ordinary bulbs and costs less than half the
price of eight such bulbs.</ul><BR>
<BR>
<hr width=71%><p>


<h4>Out and about</h4><ul>
Most car journeys are for under five miles so try asking yourself if you
really have to make that trip to work or to the shops by car. Couldn't you
walk or cycle? If not, trains are better than motor vehicles, and public
transport is much better than private. <p>

The very worst thing you can do is fly - the energy costs are truly
astronomical. A one-way flight from London to Melbourne will use up, per
person, as much as the average Northern household uses in space and water-heating
in one year. Shorter hops are even more wasteful.</ul><BR>
<BR><hr width=71%><p>

<h4>Local Action</h4><ul>
This is one area in which your local actions can have global impacts. Your
local authorities could follow the Californian example and legislate for
zero-emission vehicles. Or public buildings could be run on solar heating
or constructed using passive solar architecture. Getting your local political
representatives on side can make a big difference. The German city of Freiburg,
for example, is on the way to becoming a model 'green city', thanks to progressive
city planners. And a scheme for part of the medieval city of Regensburg,
using renewable energy and solar architecture, could become a model for
other cities in the world - and it's getting European Union funding.</ul><BR>

<h2>WHAT'S GOING WRONG?</h2>

<h3>2.1 PROBLEMS WITH AID</h3>

The poorest countries are gripped by poverty and unable to compete in the global market place. And yet they exist within a system which forces them - through structural adjustment programmes and debt repayment - to compete 'equality' (<a href="box3.html">see also "two definitions")</a>, in spite of their tiny government revenues.<p>
<p>
There is an argument that they should spend more on health, and less on defence, for example. But the reality is that with most of their money swallowed up by priorities set by the West (such as debt repayments) and other indispensable parts of the national programme, governments in the least developed countries have little room for manoeuvre within their budgets.<p>
<p>

Even if they were to increase their health budgets, they would still not be able to provide adequate health care: if Nepal doubled its health budget, it would still fall $10 per head below the World Bank suggested minimum.<p>


As the market-led model of development is unlike to change, the priority now must be to look at the vital extra source of funding - overseas aid.<p>

<h3>Inadequate and inappropriate investment</h3>

The poorest countries have been dealt a double blow, described above: not only are many of them at a juncture where their own resources cannot meet the needs of their children; but also levels of international aid to low income countries are falling.<p>


In 1996, investment of international aid by donor countries is inadequate. But the problem is not just the lack of resources. It is also a question of how development aid has been, and is, spent. Successful long-term investment in health should:

<ul type=circle>
<li>be appropriate to the context into which it is delivered;
<li>be affordable  for countries to sustain;
<li>build up local infrastructure and health and welfare systems;
<li>work through systems that are locally financed.
</ul>

Much of the investment during the 1980s did not meet these criteria. High cost programmes by western governments fragmented public health sector systems in developing countries into a series of 'quick fix' solutions, one-off treatments and high profile, big budget campaigns with unsustainable targets. Known as vertical programmes (<a href="box3.html">see also "two definitions")</a> these often addressed one problem in isolation rather than as part of a wider problem of poverty and welfare.<p>


The problem of donor-driven vertical programmes, difficult to sustain, is borne out by a national family planning campaign in Nepal. Encouraged by international donors, the National Planning Commission in Nepal set a fertility target for the millennium.<p>

An average of six children per woman will supposedly be reduced to 2.5 children by the year 2000 in a country of over 20 million people where 237,000 couples use contraception. To achieve this, six times as many people will need to use contraceptives as do now and the level of use must increase fivefold. Nepal spends $5.85 per user on contraception. The cost per year of meeting and sustaining the target would be $16.4 million or roughly $0.90 per head - the equivalent of all of Nepal's government spending on health.<p>

Even a more modest target of 4.6 births per woman by the year 2000 would need three times as many people to use contraceptives and the level of use to double costing $9.1 million, roughly $0.50 per head or half of the government's health expenditure. Countries as poor as Nepal cannot sustain such ambitious donor-led programmes - even for essential basic health services - at current levels of expenditure.<p>


Many such vertical programmes had a design fault: they crumbled once the donor departed. They budgeted for capital costs such as building a health centre without recognising that the burden of running that centre would eventually prove too much for the government. If these running costs were not met, the centre would not be sustainable.<p>


As the history of tuberculosis control shows (<a href="case_b.html"see case study b - "controlling TB")</a>health technologies cannot exist in a health policy vacuum; they must be part of an appropriate system for health care delivery and affordable within the context of the specific country.<p>

<a name="underinvestment"><h3>Under investment in running costs</h3></a>

Frequently, analysis of the cost of treatment only concentrates on the net cost of drugs to treat a single disease. The running costs of getting the drugs to the child - the delivery system - are all too often absent from the balance sheet.<p>


The value of vaccines, antibiotics and other medical technologies in the control of common diseases is beyond question. At face value, any treatment which saves a life for a handful of dollars must be money well spent. But for many countries, the cost of these technologies alone - without budgeting for the running costs - can be prohibitive. For example:<p>

<ul type=circle>
<li>In Ethiopia, a country overwhelmed by TB and showing no signs of being able to control the epidemic, the drugs needed to effect a cure and stop a person being contagious would consume the whole national budget.
</ul><p>

In Britain, the running costs of health care consume over two-thirds of the overall health budget - between £500 and £600 per person per year. In poorer countries, in the absence of an infrastructure, running costs can be an even higher proportion. For example:

<ul type=circle>
<li>In a country as poor as Ghana, the government spends $3.20 of its £3.60 per person on running costs - nearly 90 per cent of overall government health spending.
</ul>

<p>
But in many of the poorest countries, the complete neglect of running costs means the health system cannot work. They are the first costs to be cut in a period of economic decline or during structural adjustment programmes. And basic essential health services within the World Bank package become unaffordable (<a href="case_c.html">see Case Study C)</a>.<p>

Save the Children fully supports the work to immunise children and is actively involved in extending immunisation to children around the world. Where resources are in place to foot the bill, it is without question money well spent. But the running costs for governments in the poorer countries to reach the year 2000 target and sustain immunisation of all children are more than they can afford.<p>

<h1> From this month's editor</h1>

When I was a subscriber to the NI rather than one of its editors I used to value it not just because it reached the parts of the planet that
other magazines don't reach, but also for its unpredictability. Every three
or four issues there seemed to be something maverick in the magazine's treatment that varied the pace of a subscription and offered a different way into
a subject.<p>

It was only when I joined the staff that I found those maverick treatments
had often emerged out of desperation as a small co-operative with limited
resources coped with the demands of producing an international magazine of quality every month.<p>

The operation is not run so much by the seat of the pants these days and
maybe some of that ragged, raw unpredictability has gone. Good riddance,
you might well think. But we still value a treatment that puts a different
twist on a subject and thereby opens a few doors that would otherwise remain
shut.<p>



This is why we have chosen to base this issue on a fiction - that a
World People's Court has been established without the major powers managing to scupper it in advance, and that a prosecution team is about to bring cases against five important public figures around the world for their various 'crimes against humanity'. The crimes outlined, though - and the damage done to the ordinary people on the other end of them - are very real.
<p>

We do not witness their trial. Instead the dossier that the prosecution
team has compiled is opened to our gaze, including not just the charges,
the anticipated defence and the requested sentence but also the meditations of the Chief Prosecutor on how the case should be played.<p>

You might justifiably feel that these five people are by no means the world's worst 'fugitives from justice' and that there are plenty of brutal dictators still polluting the world who deserve to be put in the dock. This is perfectly true - and the Facts spread on Page 18 breaks down the human-rights record of what we consider to be the ten worst dictatorships in the world, while on Page 12 you will find out what many of the most infamous dictators from the recent past are up to now. But if the case against Saddam Hussein had been followed by a litany of the crimes of General Abacha of Nigeria
the magazine would surely have become repetitive as well as thoroughly depressing.
<p>

So we have selected a slightly less obvious quintet. I would dearly like
to have included a sixth who would have been less obvious still: Professor
Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist who has acted as a consultant exporting free-market shock therapy to both Latin America and Eastern Europe. But the case against him didn't quite gel in the time we had available. Maybe next time - any dirt you have on the dear professor may be dished to this address.<p>

<font size=+1>On the eve of the historic first proceedings in the World People's Court,
the Chief Prosecutor ruminates on the task ahead.</font><p><hr width=41%><p>




It's dark now in the building. Nobody left but me. The storm that's been
slapping the mountains about for hours is now whipping over the waters of Lake Geneva to give the glass beside me a hard time. I'm safe. It can't
touch me. But what about the storm I'll walk into tomorrow? After all my
comfortable years of cynicism, can I really make a fist of this new role
as Crusading Knight representing the Downtrodden Masses of the World? <p>

I thought I'd left all that crusading business behind a long, long time
ago in that other world called the Sixties. All of us wanted to change the
world, we just chose different ways to do it. I had a friend who blew up
a power plant in protest at the military-industrial complex during the Vietnam
War. Others wound up with their great earthmoving novel degraded into oneliners
and soundbites for ad agencies. And still others just got married and started
pouring all their dreams into their kids.<BR>
Me? I went to law school, on fire with the notion that the law was all about
justice. Ten years later there I was like any other lawyer, busily prosecuting
the weak and the disenfranchised - crucifying them for getting involved
in violence or theft in ghetto areas where they more or less had no option.
Or, worse still, putting people in prison because they couldn't pay the
fines imposed on them for some trivial offence - punishment for being
poor.<BR>
<BR>
Call me a coward or a sell-out but my reaction wasn't to put my legal skills
at the service of those same poor people, working in some community law
centre with wet rot in the walls and warm compassion in the coffee cups.
Instead I looked after myself: I went for prestige cases with prestige fees
attached and sneered at the system on the quiet as if that put me above
it. I built myself a name as well as a fancy house.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe membership of the country-club set was what did it for me in the end
- all those fine, upstanding citizens with the gall to assume I shared
their smug, bigoted ideas about crime and punishment, their enthusiasm for
cleaning up the streets with a flamethrower. They'd rant on about the pushers
and the pimps, the communists and the common riff-raff who were getting
away with murder. And in the next breath they'd tell you about their latest
scam for tax evasion without even the decency to wonder whether broadcasting
it to a lawyer might not be a very smart move. The criminals we most need
to catch don't even get called criminals.<BR>
<BR>
There had to be something better. I used my connections and got myself a
legal job inside the UN. I wish I could say that cured me of my cynicism.
But it did the trick for me in one sense - without that experience
there's no way I would have got this job as the first Chief Prosecutor at
the World People's Court. <BR>
<BR>
And this is my last chance for redemption: deep down I know that I'm desperate
for this to work out, to prove myself wrong and be reunited with all those
old ideals. I look at the team that's working for me on these first five
cases and their faith that we can bring this off is almost painful to me.
Painful because they remind me of my younger, better self but also because
I know there's next to no chance that these prosecutions will succeed. The
World People's Court was a crazy bolt from the blue, an idea about a hundred
years ahead of its time which was pushed through by the Scandinavians while
the major powers were looking the other way. But once it was in place there
was no way the big wheels were going to let it threaten their own global
country club.<BR>
<BR>
I know that when my bosses ordered me not to go for the world's worst dictators
- General Abacha of Nigeria, for example, or General Suharto of Indonesia
- they had a not-so-hidden agenda. They say that those people are being
dealt with by 'other channels'. But the real reason is that the crimes of
the Mobutus of this world are so nakedly evident that we'd have had no trouble
making our case stick. <BR>
<BR>
Instead they gave me free rein to come up with prosecutions against a second
tier of individuals who are less accepted as criminals by the world community.
They were more or less inviting me to pluck out people like Jacques Chirac
or the Pope, people so powerful that I have no chance of bringing them down.
I'll tilt at windmills and the Court will lose its credibility. They know
I know this. But we also both know that the Court already has a life of
its own - its own brief leaves it no option but to take on the powerful
and to hang itself by its own rope in the process.<BR>
<BR>
Or is this just the old cynicism creaking in my bones again?<BR>
<BR>
The storm's given out. I wish this was like some cheap novel where the change
in the weather reflects the protagonist's change in mood. But I've had enough
long dark nights of the soul to know I'm not going to get off so easy tonight.
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond the city I can see where the moon has cast a spotlight on the surface
of the Lake. Tomorrow I'll be out in the spotlight. I've prepared all my
charges, gathered all my witnesses, written all my notes for the prosecution
team. Now I just have to do the world - and myself - justice.

<h1>Swimming
against
the tide</h1>

<font size=+1>It is easy to be overcome by gloom when contemplating the worst that human beings are capable of. So we should contemplate the best, too. <b>The Right Livelihood Award,</b> often called the Alternative Nobel Prize, is dedicated to recognizing some of the people working selflessly to change the world for the better. Here are the winners for 1995.</font>




<h3>SERB CIVIC COUNCIL<br>
(Bosnia)</h3>

Created in March 1994 by Serbs loyal to the multi-ethnic democratic government in Sarajevo, the Serb Civic Council now has about 50,000 members - a third of all Serbs living in areas still controlled by the Bosnian Government. Its own vision of peace is based on the preservation of a democratic and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina in which all citizens' rights and freedoms are guaranteed in accord with the highest international standards. Members have been targeted for assassination by snipers, not least because of their links with resistance leaders operating within the region controlled by Radovan Karadzic's Pale regime. The Serb Civic Council's president is Mirko Pejanovic. <p>

British historian Adrian Hastings calls their work 'an outstanding contribution to the cause of humanity, a contribution fully comparable with that of those Germans who 50 years ago participated in the resistance to Nazism. It is, nevertheless, a
contribution which the international
community has deliberately ignored, anxious as it is to explain the conflict - quite mistakenly - as a 'civil war' between Muslims and Serbs, when it is in fact a war between a democratic and legitimate government, backed by an overwhelming majority of its population, and a fascist and terrorist movement.'



<h3>HUNGARIAN FOUNDATION FOR SELF-RELIANCE/ ANDR&Aacute;S B&Iacute;RO<br>
(Hungary)</h3>
Andr&aacute;s B&iacute;ro founded the Hungarian Foundation for Self-Reliance in 1990 to reinforce democratization by supporting initiatives on the environment and on minority rights (particularly those of the Roma or gypsy community), and by promoting civil society and grassroots democracy. The Foundation acts as a channel for voluntary aid from overseas, giving grants to grassroots organizations. But it is also leading an initiative to address the problems of the Roma in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia as well as Hungary, concentrating on income-generating schemes - the Roma have been particularly badly hit by the ballooning unemployment which has followed the switch to the free market. The Foundation also awards a 'Tolerance Prize' each year for the best contribution to Hungarian ethnic harmony by a journalist or broadcaster.<p>



<h3>SULAK SIVARAKSA<br>
(Thailand)</h3>

Sulak Sivaraksa has spent a lifetime working for human rights and democracy - and for an alternative development model to that of Western consumerism. He has played a leading role in the mobilization of civil society in Thailand, creating a string of social-welfare and development organizations, including a commission which trains Buddhist monks for development activism, and the Santi Pracha Dhamma Institute which promotes 'democratic ideals and practice through non-violent means'. Sivaraksa's consistent rejection of the Western development model in favour of a holistic, spiritually based alternative - one which is responsive to local cultures - has been of great influence worldwide. He has repeatedly incurred the wrath of the Thai Government, particularly in its military incarnations, and was forced into exile in 1991-92. He is currently working on
two new initiatives: an international  'Alternatives to Consumerism' network and a new college in Thailand which will explore an alternative, more holistic approach to education.<p>






<h3>CARMEL BUDIARDJO<br>
(Indonesia/Britain)</h3>

Carmel Budiardjo suffered three years' detention without trial before being forced to leave Indonesia in 1971. In 1973 she founded TAPOL, the Indonesia human-rights campaign and has run it ever since from its base in London, England. TAPOL has become the leading English-language source on Indonesian human-rights abuses (the word 'tapol' is a contraction of two Indonesian words meaning 'political prisoner'). Carmel was a major contributor to the NI issue on East Timor (March 1994).<p>

According to the International Federation for East Timor, based in Japan: 'If today the tide of international opinion is turning with regard to the Suharto regime; if some of Indonesia's trade partners and economic aid donor countries are beginning to factor in democratization and human-rights protection in their relations with Jakarta; if Western arms sales to Indonesia are at last being seen in light of their true destructiveness: in no small measure this is due to the accumulated efforts for two decades of Carmel Budiardjo and TAPOL... A committed human-rights worker can make a difference. Carmel Budiardjo is proof of that.'	<p>

<title>Africa takes a male-friendly approach to family planning</title>

<h1>Africa takes a male-friendly approach to family planning</h1>

<b>by Deryck Onyango Omuodo</b><p>








Men are more like to be in favour of family planning - and to use a method themselves - if programmes and services are provided through "men only" clinics, and educational programmes are conducted men-to-men.  This has been demonstrated in several studies and by the popularity of such approaches when they have been introduced.  <p>




Human beings will resist changes which threaten their security. Very often in the field of family planning, programme objectives contain words or slogans which threaten men.  The men end up rejecting programmes which, if presented in different ways, would gain their full support and participation.  
<p>



Programmes which empower women to deny men their human rights and freedoms are not male-friendly.  Instead, those working in family planning should encourage men to accept, respect and promote the sexual and reproductive rights and freedoms of women.  Families thrive on sharing, and programmes of change could usefully focus on persuading men to become more involved in reproductive health issues and in sharing the burden of family planning with their wives or partners.  
<p>



The following excerpts from taped conversations among educated African men on changing male responsibility illustrate the level of male dominance and the significance of fears of threats to their security.<p>





<blockquote><i>"If you are a man you are the boss in the home. You decide what the family should look like. You decide how many children you should have. You decide where your children should go to school, or if they should go to school or not. You are the boss."</i> <br>(Journalist from Kenya).</blockquote><p>



<blockquote><i>"...The man ...is the major decision-maker ... he determines almost everything that happens in the family... Even when his wife is working, and earning income, she is still subject to the decisions of the husband. ... Even if she makes more money than the man, she is expected to submit to her husband." </i><br>(Demographer from Nigeria).</blockquote><p>




<blockquote><i>"If you look at the real situation, most of the career women have problems with their families because the man becomes kind of inferior.., you find the marriages having problems. The man becomes more comfortable when he has economic power." </i><br>(Finance official from Malawi).</blockquote><p>




Male-friendly approaches should address the fears of men. For example, there is a deep-rooted fear that contraception endows women with too much freedom and so reduces a husband's span of control over a wife's sexuality. Some men believe that contraception causes unfaithfulness and that continuous child-bearing places unfaithfulness under control.<p>




While it is essential to promote programmes which empower women to exercise control over  their fertility, such programmes can improve their chances of success if implemented alongside educational programmes which help men to understand the rationale and need for them to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of women, and why sexual and reproductive health decisions should be the joint responsibility of men and women. <p>




The concept of rights can imply militancy, so care must be taken if statements of programme objectives and goals are phrased in terms of rights.  A process of change has to be courted through education and persuasion.  The more men are reminded of women's reproductive health rights without proper explanation, the more they will resist positive change.<p>




Male-friendly and negotiated approaches can speed up the move towards gender equality in matters of planned parenthood.  Promoting spousal communication will encourage mutual understanding between husbands and wives on sexual and reproductive health decisions and practices.  Family life education programmes which promote respectful and harmonious partnership between males and females, young and old can be a good starting point.  As well as educating men about the benefits of sharing more equally in family life, such programmes should help family members understand their sexuality and inform them how to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and other sexual and reproductive health problems. 
<p>



In several African countries, projects are being run which take a male-friendly approach.   In Togo, the family planning association is using the media to sensitize specific male groups, aiming in particular to instil positive attitudes towards family planning in traditional and religious leaders. The family planning association in Ghana is providing information to targeted groups of men in various locations and has reported improved male involvement in terms of increased awareness and knowledge turned into practice. The forerunners to this approach were successful initiatives with male plantation managers to get their workers to promote and practise family planning, and a Daddies Club aimed at persuading men to share in parental responsibility. <p>




In Swaziland the family planning association runs a programme to dispel fears and rumours among men and assure them of the safety of contraception.  Men-to-men teams join women in targeting male audiences in specific locations with family planning education and messages.<p>




The Sierra Leone family planning association has achieved successful results conveying messages about preventing sexually transmitted diseases and the benefits to family well-being of family planning at male-specific group meetings, film shows, lectures and visits.  Other associations have used drama, song, puppetry and other forms of entertainment, as well as the print media, audio-visual presentations, awareness seminars, training workshops, advocacy and social marketing, to reach men. Income-generation, advocacy and workers' education are other initiatives undertaken. <p>




 The most direct approach is being carried out  by the Family Planning Association of Kenya, which is providing "male only" services at its special clinics in three district locations in the country.  This bold, male-friendly venture expects the same positive results reported by other "male only" service outlets.<p>




Women, too, are calling for male-friendly approaches.  At the Africa Regional Conference on Women, Islam and Family Planning, organized by the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1995,  men were urged to become more involved in the implementation of reproductive health and family planning programmes.  Women attending the conference realized that men-by-men and men-for-men programmes could achieve good results.<p>




Male-friendly approaches can go a long way to moderate societal and cultural barriers that prevent men take joint decisions with women on family planning and sexual and reproductive health, and sharing the responsibility with them.  And they can achieve far better results than programmes which threaten men's security and which diminish their feeling of masculinity. <p>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Greek Development Cooperation</h3>



Official development cooperation in Greece started in the late 1980s. It has a very low profile among the

media and the public, whose attention is focused on domestic economic problems. 

<p>

The volume of Greek official aid has risen sharply since its recent start. In 1991 total aid amounted to less

than US $ 4 million, while in 1993 it had risen to more then US $ 20 million. Greece still receives an

amount of ODA of more then US $ 30 million. Contributions are made to multilateral institutions and to EU

aid programmes. Greece is not a DAC-member.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Responsibility for the aid programme rests with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In 1992 a Directorate for

Development Cooperation and Special Economic Affairs was set up within this Ministry. The Directorate

does not have the overall authority for development cooperation. In addition, departments of the Ministries

of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Finance and Education also deal with issues related to development cooperation

policy. Interministerial coordination of aid efforts and policy is presently wanting and technical expertise is

apparently low.

<p>

More than half of the aid volume is spent through a growing number of recently created private

organisations. These are mainly NGOs of which the Red Cross stands out by a wide margin. Aid from

NGOs has also been supported quite substantially by EU funding.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

There is no advisory structure for development cooperation in Greece. The growing number of NGOs

involved in development cooperation are lobbying with the Government for a more clear and coherent

development cooperation policy. They are also concerned with raising public awareness of development

problems.

<p>

The Greek Parliament does not seem to take a great interest in the problems of the South, or the growing

aid budget of the Government. Not many questions are asked on the subject. Parliament does not receive an

annual report on development assistance.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

There seems to be no research community focused on development cooperation. The ten Development

Research and Training Institutes mentioned by the 1991 OECD/EADI survey do not specialise in Third

World development problems.

<center><h1>The STEP Project</h1></center>
<br><br clear=left>


STEP, The Painswick Inn, Gloucester Street,<br>
Stroud, Gloucestershire GL5 1QG<br>
Tel: 01453 759941,  Fax: 01453 759211<p>


STEP is affiliated to the Painswick Inn Project,<br>
an initiative of Shire Training Workshops<br><br><br>


<h2>STEP - Project Proposal</h2>

<h3>1. Outline</h3>

Swaziland Theatre Experience Project will provide a one year programme to motivate, train and develop the individual potential of a group of unemployed young people. The UK base for this project is Stroud, Gloucestershire.<p>
Following a six month preparation period, the group will go to Swaziland in Southern Africa where they will work together with a group of local young people to refurbish and bring to life a defunct theatre in Mbabane. It is intended that this pioneer project will lead the way for further self-help schemes for disadvantaged young adults.

<h3>2. The People</h3>

Larry Leighton, the founder and co-ordinator of this project, has nurtured for some years the wish to bring together his experience of living and working in Africa and of working with disadvantaged young people.<p>

The possibility of transforming the Swaziland Theatre Club facilities, which have been virtually unused for 4-5 years, into a Community Theatre and Arts Centre, provides an ideal opportunity to establish and international, cross-cultural project. <p>

The Theatre Club was founded in 1963, opened in 1964, and for a quarter of  a century was active as a centre for drama. Its decline and neglect over the past few years has been due to a diminishing membership and an apparent lack of enthusiasm and commitment by those remaining to be open to, aware of and responsive to the needs and potential in the local community. However, in response to our initiative, there is now a new, enthusiastic Theatre Management Team (TMT) in place who are committed to redevelopment and who have invited People's Educational Theatre (PET), a local community-based youth theatre group, to participate in the project.

<h3>3. The Link with Swaziland</h3>

In Swazi culture, the elements of story-telling, dance, music and singing, figure strongly. Add to this the rapidly changing social, cultural and political scene in Southern Africa and the desire, particularly among the young, to find new, valid and acceptable forms of exploring and expressing social and environmental issues, and accessible centre for the performing arts would be highly valued. As this is Swaziland's only theatre and near the centre of the capital, Mbabane, this potential becomes emphasised.<p>


Swaziland is currently struggling with the difficulties of integrating traditional and modern ways of life. As a result of this and other social, economic and political issues, their young people are experiencing great vulnerability and powerlessness in the face of social problems such as high unemployment, crime, AIDS, poverty, homelessness, drugs and conflicting social and cultural values. <p>

These experiences are reinforced by growing environmental challenges including deforestation, drought and pollution. <p>

Against this bleak background, the opportunities for personal development, self-esteem and true confidence building for such unemployed young people within the context of a community cultural project, are great. They would be suitably enriched and enhanced by working together with a group of similar aged individuals from another country and culture who have encountered similar problems at home but have begun the process of challenging them. As a result they would then be well-placed and motivated to participate in local economic regeneration and the struggle for self-reliance.<p>



The young people from England will mostly come from Stroud, which is somewhat similar to Mbabane in that it is a small town that straggles out along beautiful rural valleys. The lack of opportunities for long-term meaningful employment and suitable available housing, the apparent meaninglessness of life and constant social challenges that they experience in England will find a different hue when they meet what their Swazi partners experience.


<h3> Benefits and Beneficiaries.</h3>

STEP aims:<p>

<ul>
<li>to provide a substantial programme of training, motivation, orientation and confidence-building for approx. 15 young people from the UK between the ages of 18 and 28.<p>


<li>to share and develop the experiences of this programme with a similar group of young people in Swaziland.<p>


<li>to create an experience of community awareness for the participants through providing for the community.<p>


<li>to provoke and promote cross-cultural, international and racial awareness which will lead to a sense of purpose, understanding, openness and acceptance.</ul><p>


The overall objective for each project participant will be to establish a creative yet sustainable attitude, approach, and strategy to meet and survive today's ever-shifting world. To foster and encourage this, individual programmes and projects will feature throughout the year and be woven into group and project objectives. The available skills to be pursued will range through:<p>


<ul><li>administration: book-keeping, computing etc.<p>


<li>craft: carpentry, painting and decorating, costume, mask-making, lighting, sound, photography etc.<p>


<li>
Performing arts: acting, story-telling, music, movement, voice etc.<p>


<li>Social communication, leadership, understanding, co-operation, negotiation etc.</ul><p>


These are the benefits to the participants in the project, but clearly the beneficiaries will also be the communities within which they will work. <p>
In the UK, foundations will be laid for the STEP Youth Theatre during the preparation period and on our return. This will provide a resource for current and future opportunities for other local young people. <p>

The Stroud Community as a whole will clearly benefit also from this. In Swaziland, the aim is to create a sustainable community theatre and Arts Centre. This would provide a rich cultural resource for not only the community of Mbabane but also the whole of Swaziland in that travelling performances and exhibitions could be developed and venture out throughout the country. Furthermore, realistic new employment and training opportunities would arise there. The presence of  a group of enthusiastic young people from Britain seeking inspiration from the Swazi people, their culture and environment could also inspire new confidence and self esteem in the community.<p>

Pistes de r&eacute;flexion sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE</i>. (Rapport No. 6). Maastricht: Centre Europ&#233;en de Gestion des Politiques de D&#233;veloppement.

<HR><P>

<H3>L'&eacute;rosion du partenariat de Lom&eacute;</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171; Le partenariat est devenu une &eacute;tiquette d&eacute;nu&eacute;e de sens qui ne refl&egrave;te plus un r&eacute;el d&eacute;sir de coop&eacute;rer sur la base d'un programme politique commun. Il est prisonnier de pr&eacute;occupations &agrave; court terme li&eacute;es &agrave; la gestion bureaucratique de l'aide &#187; (un  parlementaire africain).</I>

<P>

Le partenariat a &eacute;t&eacute; une notion centrale, quasi magique, des relations ACP-UE. La premi&egrave;re Convention de Lom&eacute; (1975) &eacute;tait cens&eacute;e introduire un &#171; partenariat entre &eacute;gaux &#187; convenu contractuellement, bas&eacute; sur des droits et obligations mutuels : les deux parties prenaient des engagements &agrave; long terme visant &agrave; atteindre des objectifs communs. Les pays ACP avaient un r&#244;le pr&eacute;pond&eacute;rant dans la gestion des ressources de Lom&eacute;, l'UE se cantonnant dans une fonction de soutien. Un dispositif (assez complexe) d'institutions communes fut mis en place afin de structurer les diff&eacute;rentes formes de dialogue et de favoriser une mise en oeuvre efficace. Ce concept de partenariat ainsi que les principes de dialogue, de contractualit&eacute; et de pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; constituent ce que l'on appelle la &#171; culture de Lom&eacute; &#187;.

<P>

Vingt ans plus tard, le partenariat a perdu une grande partie de son &acirc;me et de ses effets pratiques. On a compar&eacute; son &eacute;volution au mouvement d'un pendule.  Lom&eacute; I (1975) a clairement plac&eacute; les partenaires ACP aux commandes tandis que l'Europe adoptait une attitude de laisser-faire (&#171; C'est votre argent, &agrave; vous de d&eacute;cider ce que vous en faites &#187;). Les Conventions suivantes ont cherch&eacute; &agrave; int&eacute;grer les pr&eacute;occupations des bailleurs de fonds dans le partenariat. Actuellement, le pendule semble avoir davantage bascul&eacute; vers l'autre extr&ecirc;me, &agrave; savoir une attitude de plus en plus &#171; paternaliste &#187; de l'Europe (&#171; C'est notre argent et nous d&eacute;cidons de son utilisation &#187;).

<P>

L'&eacute;rosion du partenariat de Lom&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; confirm&eacute;e au cours des consultations effectu&eacute;es sur le terrain et lors de la conf&eacute;rence de l'ECDPM. Un sentiment de d&eacute;sillusion et de frustration grandit de part et d'autre de la relation. Dans l'ensemble, les pays ACP ont l'impression de ne plus &ecirc;tre les partenaires pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;s de l'Europe, tant sur le plan du commerce que sur celui de l'aide. Les conditionnalit&eacute;s remplacent le dialogue. Les mod&egrave;les de d&eacute;veloppement sont impos&eacute;s par la communaut&eacute; donatrice et ne tiennent souvent gu&egrave;re compte des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s locales, des contraintes de mise en oeuvre et des diff&eacute;rences entre les pays.

<P>

Le souci d'efficacit&eacute; pousse l'UE &agrave; r&eacute;duire l'influence des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires dans le partenariat et &agrave; appliquer uniform&eacute;ment des approches &#171; cl&eacute;s en main &#187; assez g&eacute;n&eacute;rales &agrave; tous les pays ACP. En outre, la rigidit&eacute; et la complexit&eacute; des proc&eacute;dures sont autant d'obstacles qui emp&ecirc;chent les pays ACP de tirer pleinement profit des instruments et des ressources disponibles. Les acteurs non &eacute;tatiques des pays ACP sont frustr&eacute;s,  eux aussi  ; ils consid&egrave;rent Lom&eacute; comme &#171; une affaire du gouvernement &#187;. Un tel monopole est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme p&eacute;rim&eacute; et inefficace. De plus, nombreux sont ceux qui estiment que l'UE n'a pas de vision &agrave; long terme quant &agrave; la mani&egrave;re de soutenir le d&eacute;veloppement des ACP.

<P>

Au niveau de l'UE (c'est-&agrave;-dire de la Commission europ&eacute;enne et des Etats membres), on affirme qu'il est difficile d'&eacute;tablir de v&eacute;ritables partenariats avec des pays qui ont une mauvaise gouvernance ou ne poss&egrave;dent pas les capacit&eacute;s administratives n&eacute;cessaires. Cela laisse peu de place &agrave; une utilisation transparente et efficace des ressources et pousse la Commission &agrave; adopter une approche plus interventionniste (de substitution). Son personnel sur le terrain constate que le partenariat de Lom&eacute; est devenu un fardeau plut&#244;t qu'un outil de d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

D'un avis assez g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, la Commission ne poss&egrave;de pas les capacit&eacute;s humaines et institutionnelles qui lui permettraient d'assumer correctement son r&#244;le dans le partenariat. Dans une perspective plus politique et globale, on constate que les ACP ne figurent plus en haut de l'&eacute;chelle des pr&eacute;occupations g&eacute;opolitiques, &eacute;conomiques et de s&eacute;curit&eacute; de l'UE. L'inefficacit&eacute; et le faible impact de Lom&eacute; aggravent encore la crise de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;. Les ONG europ&eacute;ennes (de promotion et de pression) critiquent vivement cette &eacute;rosion de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de l'UE pour les pays ACP. Elles consid&egrave;rent que cette tendance &agrave; la baisse r&eacute;v&egrave;le un manque de vision et contredit les politiques formul&eacute;es par l'UE en mati&egrave;re de lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;.

<P>

<H3>Vers un partenariat moderne et efficace</H3>

<P>

Cette image assez sombre du partenariat soul&egrave;ve des questions essentielles pour l'UE et les ACP. Le partenariat est-il toujours un concept utile ? Les principes de la Convention et les proc&eacute;dures connexes sont-ils toujours valables ou n&eacute;cessitent-ils une r&eacute;forme fondamentale ? Comment peut-on revitaliser le partenariat de Lom&eacute; ?

<P>

<H4>Un concept valable n&eacute;cessitant une profonde red&eacute;finition ...</H4>

<P>

L'ad&eacute;quation du terme &#171; partenariat &#187; pour qualifier la coop&eacute;ration future de Lom&eacute; fait l'objet d'un d&eacute;bat anim&eacute;. Certains sont partisans d'une suppression totale, pr&eacute;textant que cela n'a gu&egrave;re de sens de perp&eacute;tuer le mythe d'un partenariat &eacute;gal. D'autres mettent en garde contre le risque qu'une telle mesure r&eacute;duise la coop&eacute;ration &agrave; de la simple charit&eacute;. Ils affirment que les principes fondamentaux du partenariat de Lom&eacute; sont tout &agrave; fait valables (&agrave; savoir responsabilit&eacute; des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, dialogue et pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute;).

<P>

Le probl&egrave;me r&eacute;side plut&#244;t dans l'application de ces principes. On ne peut pas pr&eacute;sumer qu'un partenariat existe simplement parce qu'un contrat a &eacute;t&eacute; sign&eacute; ; le partenariat doit &ecirc;tre r&eacute;alis&eacute; plut&#244;t que proclam&eacute;. Avec le recul, on pourrait dire que la mise en oeuvre du partenariat de Lom&eacute; &eacute;tait bas&eacute;e sur un trop grand nombre de pr&eacute;suppos&eacute;s, tels que l'existence d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et d'objectifs communs, des gouvernements responsables dans les pays ACP, l'absence de probl&egrave;mes de fonctionnement au sein de ces gouvernements, une volont&eacute; de l'UE de s'attaquer &agrave; ses incoh&eacute;rences internes et, enfin, l'existence des capacit&eacute;s n&eacute;cessaires, tant dans les pays ACP qu'&agrave; la Commission, pour g&eacute;rer Lom&eacute; de mani&egrave;re efficace.

<P>

En outre, les partenaires de Lom&eacute; ne sont pratiquement pas parvenus &agrave; adapter la Convention aux principaux changements survenus dans l'environnement politique international (y compris l'&eacute;volution de la conception du r&#244;le de l'Etat, la participation des acteurs non &eacute;tatiques) et aux nouvelles exigences de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement (bonne gouvernance, responsabilisation, transparence). Le partenariat de Lom&eacute; est ainsi tomb&eacute; en d&eacute;su&eacute;tude &agrave; bien des &eacute;gards.

<P>

Dans ce contexte, le partenariat semble &ecirc;tre une forme valable de coop&eacute;ration mais sa raison d'&ecirc;tre, ses &eacute;l&eacute;ments et son mode de fonctionnement doivent &ecirc;tre fondamentalement revus. Il s'agit donc de s'attaquer aux probl&egrave;mes persistants de mise en oeuvre des deux c&#244;t&eacute;s, et de moderniser le partenariat de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

<H4>...fond&eacute;e sur une analyse objective des faiblesses</H4>

<P>

L'&eacute;tape suivante consiste &agrave; identifier les principales pierres d'achoppement des approches actuelles du partenariat. Cinq facteurs essentiels m&eacute;ritent d'&ecirc;tre soulign&eacute;s :

<P>

<LI><I>Fondements politiques faibles</I>. Lors de la signature de la premi&egrave;re Convention de Lom&eacute;, des liens historiques forts et des interd&eacute;pendances reconnues unissaient l'Europe et les pays ACP. Ce n'est plus le cas. Le partenariat actuel se pr&eacute;occupe principalement de la mobilisation, de l'utilisation et de la justification de l'aide. Cette interpr&eacute;tation restrictive met l'accent sur le contr&#244;le bureaucratique plut&#244;t que sur la substance de la coop&eacute;ration. Pour reprendre les termes d'un participant ACP : &#171; Aucun partenariat n'est possible en l'absence d'une base politique solide pour la coop&eacute;ration ; il tend &agrave; se r&eacute;duire &agrave; une forme d'assistance dans laquelle les organismes donateurs tiennent immanquablement les r&ecirc;nes &#187;.

<P>

<LI><I>Coh&eacute;sion ACP et UE</I>. Il n'est pas certain que les ACP et l'UE soient des partenaires bien assortis pour danser un pas de deux. Il existe peut-&ecirc;tre de bonnes raisons pour garder le groupe ACP uni, mais la solidarit&eacute; ACP a aussi un prix. Plusieurs de nos interlocuteurs ACP admettent que le groupe est tout simplement &#171; trop grand et trop h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;ne &#187; pour n&eacute;gocier un accord avec l'UE qui r&eacute;ponde aux besoins des diff&eacute;rents pays et r&eacute;gions ACP. Une situation similaire r&egrave;gne du c&#244;t&eacute; de l'UE. Une Commission de plus en plus fragment&eacute;e doit jongler avec 15 Etats membres portant chacun un regard diff&eacute;rents sur le d&eacute;veloppement et sur le r&#244;le sp&eacute;cifique de l'aide commu- nautaire. Il n'est pas surprenant, d&egrave;s lors, que les progr&egrave;s accomplis dans le domaine de la coordination et de la coh&eacute;rence politique soient assez faibles.

<P>

<LI><I>Equilibre et r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;</I>. Dans la plupart des partenariats, il est difficile de parvenir &agrave; une ad&eacute;quation entre les besoins des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et les priorit&eacute;s des donateurs. Les approches exclusives n'apportent aucune solution. Les approches r&eacute;gies par les donateurs sont tentantes, mais elles sont condamn&eacute;es &agrave; l'&eacute;chec si l'appropriation et la participation des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires font d&eacute;faut. Encourager la r&eacute;forme d&eacute;mocratique peut ainsi &ecirc;tre un objectif commun des ACP et de l'UE. Cependant, comme l'a fait remarquer un participant africain : &#171; La d&eacute;mocratisation est une course de fond et non pas un 100 m&egrave;tres olympique ; chaque pays devrait se voir accorder la possibilit&eacute; d'organiser son propre syst&egrave;me de d&eacute;mocratie &#187;. En m&ecirc;me temps, il n'y a pas de mal &agrave; ce que les organismes donateurs mettent en avant leurs propres objectifs et priorit&eacute;s. C'est d'ailleurs souvent une condition n&eacute;cessaire au maintien du soutien par les contribuables europ&eacute;ens. Le partenariat de Lom&eacute; doit encore trouver un point d'&eacute;quilibre permettant de concilier les besoins des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et les priorit&eacute;s des donateurs &agrave; des conditions mutuellement acceptables.

<P>

<LI><I>Monopole de l'Etat</I>. L'opinion selon laquelle le potentiel de Lom&eacute; n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; totalement exploit&eacute; parce qu'il d&eacute;pend beaucoup trop de l'Etat recueille un consensus &eacute;crasant. Cette d&eacute;pendance emp&ecirc;che les autres acteurs (par exemple, le secteur priv&eacute;) de remplir leur fonction dans le d&eacute;veloppement (sur la base du principe de subsidiarit&eacute;). En particulier dans les pays dot&eacute;s de gouvernements faibles et peu responsables, cette recette garantit l'&eacute;chec. Du c&#244;t&eacute; europ&eacute;en aussi, il est possible de &#171; d&eacute;bureaucratiser &#187; partiellement la gestion des programmes de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<LI><I>Manque de strat&eacute;gies de mise en oeuvre ad&eacute;quates</I>. La d&eacute;finition d'un ensemble sens&eacute; de principes de partenariat constitue une &eacute;tape n&eacute;cessaire mais non suffisante pour assurer une mise en oeuvre efficace. Aux yeux de nombreux praticiens, il manque &agrave; la Convention un cadre op&eacute;rationnel clair, adapt&eacute; &agrave; l'h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&eacute;n&eacute;it&eacute; croissante des pays ACP et aux capacit&eacute;s de la Commission europ&eacute;enne. Par exemple, le fait de laisser la direction des op&eacute;rations aux pays ACP est une condition n&eacute;cessaire mais insuffisante pour que le partenariat fonctionne. Il faut traduire ces principes dans des syst&egrave;mes op&eacute;rationnels clairs pouvant s'adapter aux diff&eacute;rentes conditions et capacit&eacute;s locales.

<P><H3>

Les &eacute;l&eacute;ments constitutifs d'un partenariat moderne</H3>

<P>

Comment peut-on d&eacute;velopper une nouvelle culture de partenariat ? Quels sont les &eacute;l&eacute;ments constitutifs d'un partenariat plus m&ucirc;r et plus efficace ? Que faut-il supprimer, sauvegarder ou ajouter &agrave; la culture actuelle de Lom&eacute; ? Dans cette section, nous passons en revue quelques-unes des principales options soulev&eacute;es au cours du processus de consultation.

<P><H4>

Donner au partenariat une base politique solide</H4>

<P>

La future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE aura in&eacute;vitablement un caract&egrave;re plus politique. Les droits de l'homme, la d&eacute;mocratie et la bonne gouvernance sont devenus des &eacute;l&eacute;ments essentiels du partenariat de Lom&eacute;. L'UE consid&egrave;re que la promotion d'un Etat de droit est un objectif de d&eacute;veloppement central. Cette politisation est susceptible de s'accentuer &agrave; mesure que la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne au d&eacute;veloppement est plus fortement influenc&eacute;e par les conditions &eacute;conomiques nationales et par des pr&eacute;occupations changeantes de s&eacute;curit&eacute; et de politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re que par les besoins des pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

Les vents tournent &eacute;galement du c&#244;t&eacute; ACP. L'insatisfaction suscit&eacute;e par les approches actuelles de l'aide et la peur de l'avenir alimentent la recherche d'un nouveau partenariat politique avec l'Europe. Ainsi est apparue une scission parmi les pays ACP. Ceux qui s'opposent au changement sont mis sous pression comme on l'a vu lors de l'Assembl&eacute;e paritaire ACP-UE qui s'est tenue en Namibie en mars 1996 et au cours de laquelle les pays ACP ont appuy&eacute; une r&eacute;solution condamnant le r&eacute;gime nig&eacute;rian.

<P>

Ces  changements  sont  prometteurs.   Ils   semblent   indiquer   qu'un   nouveau

&#171; contrat &#187; peut &ecirc;tre n&eacute;goci&eacute;. Cependant, les ACP affirment que cela n&eacute;cessitera un meilleur dialogue. Les approches actuelles ressemblent plus &agrave; des diktats politiques qu'&agrave; des accords n&eacute;goci&eacute;s entre pairs. Elles ne permettent pas de tenir s&eacute;rieusement compte des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s politiques locales, des solutions nationales de r&eacute;forme politique, des th&egrave;mes importants pour les ACP, ni des incoh&eacute;rences des donateurs pratiquant deux poids - deux mesures.  Pour pouvoir progresser, le dialogue ACP-UE doit &ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute; (voir encadr&eacute; 5.1).

<P>

<H4>Concilier les besoins des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et les pr&eacute;occupations des bailleurs de fonds</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171; Les bailleurs de fonds ont un r&#244;le fondamental &agrave; jouer dans l'encouragement de politiques macro-&eacute;conomiques s&eacute;rieuses et de la gestion des affaires publiques dans les pays ACP faibles. Dans tout type de partenariat, il faudrait discuter et convenir conjointement de conditions r&eacute;alistes. Si, pour une raison ou pour une autre, les promesses ne sont pas tenues, les bailleurs de fonds ont l'obligation de retirer leurs ressources &#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile africaine).</I>

<P>

Arriver &agrave; un &eacute;quilibre subtil entre la responsabilit&eacute; des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et le besoin qu'ont les organismes donateurs de justifier l'utilisation de l'aide est la cl&eacute; d'un partenariat adulte. De nombreuses personnes interrog&eacute;es dans le groupe ACP affirment que &#171; le meilleur partenariat est celui dans lequel les aspirations des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et les attentes des organismes donateurs co&iuml;ncident au maximum &#187;.

<P>

Le partenariat de Lom&eacute; n'a pas vraiment r&eacute;ussi &agrave; trouver cet &eacute;quilibre. Des r&eacute;formes r&eacute;centes ont r&eacute;pondu aux pr&eacute;occupations l&eacute;gitimes des organismes donateurs. Mais, ce faisant, le principe de la responsabilit&eacute; des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires s'est consid&eacute;rablement effrit&eacute;. Par exemple, la tendance de la CE &agrave; se substituer aux gouvernements d&eacute;ficients a &eacute;t&eacute; consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme un pas en arri&egrave;re vers des retranchements paternalistes, voire une capitulation face &agrave; la mission de d&eacute;veloppement v&eacute;ritable. 

<P>

Les d&eacute;bats en cours font appara&icirc;tre une option privil&eacute;gi&eacute;e pour les futures relations de partenariat qui peut se r&eacute;sumer comme suit :

<P>

<LI>On ne peut accepter aucun compromis sur le principe de responsabilit&eacute; des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires au nom d'une efficacit&eacute; &agrave; court terme (de l'aide). Le d&eacute;veloppement est un processus interne. Les organismes donateurs peuvent jouer les mod&eacute;rateurs et contribuer &agrave; la mise en oeuvre de r&eacute;formes importantes. Mais, en fin de compte, aucune pression ext&eacute;rieure ne peut remplacer les responsabilit&eacute;s internes.

<P>

<LI>Toutefois, il est l&eacute;gitime que les organismes donateurs placent l'argent l&agrave; o&ugrave; il peut &ecirc;tre le mieux utilis&eacute;. Cependant, plut&#244;t que de revenir aux anciennes m&eacute;thodes de gestion et de contr&#244;le par les bailleurs de fonds, la Commission devrait adopter des approches sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; chaque pays. L&agrave; o&ugrave; une r&eacute;elle confiance r&egrave;gne, on pourrait convenir d'un partenariat souple et ouvert ; dans les cas o&ugrave; l'on n'arrive pas &agrave; une ad&eacute;quation mutuellement acceptable des attentes, la CE devrait envisager d'autres solutions que le partenariat.

<P>

L'&eacute;volution des articles 4 et 5 de la Convention de Lom&eacute; (relatifs aux objectifs de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement) en est un exemple. Dans sa version actuelle (Lom&eacute; IV bis), la Convention propose une ad&eacute;quation des priorit&eacute;s de d&eacute;veloppement ACP et de celles de l'UE (telles qu'elles sont exprim&eacute;es par le trait&eacute; de Maastricht). D'un point de vue europ&eacute;en, on a affirm&eacute; qu'on voyait mal comment les grands objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement du trait&eacute; (d&eacute;veloppement durable, lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;, int&eacute;gration des pays en d&eacute;veloppement dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale, droits de l'homme et d&eacute;mocratie) pouvaient &ecirc;tre en conflit avec les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts ACP, du moins sur le plan des principes. Le vrai d&eacute;fi consiste plut&#244;t &agrave; &eacute;tablir de nouveaux m&eacute;canismes permettant d'assurer une mise en oeuvre juste et &eacute;quilibr&eacute;e de ces principes.

<P>

Il faut encore travailler &agrave; la mise au point des modalit&eacute;s de partenariats de cette nature. A cet effet, deux mesures sont de la plus haute importance. La premi&egrave;re consiste &agrave; renforcer les capacit&eacute;s dans les pays ACP en vue du partenariat. Cela signifie qu'il faut cr&eacute;er les conditions favorables pour le d&eacute;veloppement de leurs propres id&eacute;es, programmes et strat&eacute;gies. Un soutien cibl&eacute; du renforcement des capacit&eacute;s, destin&eacute; tant aux institutions du secteur public qu'aux groupes de r&eacute;flexion (autonomes), contribuera &agrave; assurer un dialogue politique plus &eacute;quilibr&eacute;. La deuxi&egrave;me mesure consiste &agrave; d&eacute;l&eacute;guer l'autorit&eacute; de gestion aux personnes actives sur le terrain. C'est l&agrave; une condition n&eacute;cessaire pour des approches de partenariat inspir&eacute;es par les r&eacute;alit&eacute;s locales plut&#244;t que par les discours officiels.

<P>

<H4>Trouver des solutions de rechange &agrave; l'allocation syst&eacute;matique de l'aide</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171; La poursuite du partenariat d&eacute;pendra de la volont&eacute; des ACP d'assurer une gestion responsable des ressources ext&eacute;rieures qui leur sont apport&eacute;es &#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant de l'UE).</I>

<P>

L'actuelle culture de l'allocation syst&eacute;matique, bas&eacute;e sur des enveloppes quinquennales par pays ne tenant pas compte des r&eacute;sultats, est difficile &agrave; concilier avec un partenariat moderne et efficace offrant la possibilit&eacute; d'&eacute;valuer de mani&egrave;re critique la performance du pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire dans la r&eacute;alisation des obligations convenues.

<P>

L'UE, en particulier, pr&eacute;tend que la future coop&eacute;ration devrait &ecirc;tre bas&eacute;e sur la performance. L'aide ext&eacute;rieure est destin&eacute;e &agrave; &#171; aider ceux qui s'aident eux-m&ecirc;mes &#187;. Cela implique un choix tr&egrave;s s&eacute;lectif des partenaires et une distinction entre ceux qui ont de bons r&eacute;sultats et ceux qui ont de mauvais r&eacute;sultats. La fin de la culture de l'allocation syst&eacute;matique signifie &eacute;galement qu'il faudra d&eacute;finir de nouveaux crit&egrave;res d'allocation de l'aide. Cela soul&egrave;ve d'importantes questions tant sur le plan du contenu que sur celui du processus.

<P>

En ce qui concerne le contenu, l'allocation de l'aide pourrait &ecirc;tre bas&eacute;e sur deux crit&egrave;res principaux : les besoins et les m&eacute;rites. Le crit&egrave;re des besoins ne devrait pas constituer une importante pomme de discorde. Il permettra, par exemple, de mettre en exergue la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; dans la coop&eacute;ration future. C'est l&agrave; un objectif politique partag&eacute; par la Convention de Lom&eacute; et le trait&eacute; de Maastricht. En outre, les niveaux de pauvret&eacute; peuvent &ecirc;tre mesur&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re relativement objective.

<P>

R&eacute;partir l'aide en se fondant sur les m&eacute;rites est plus d&eacute;licat. On peut appr&eacute;hender le m&eacute;rite &agrave; diff&eacute;rents niveaux, dont la performance dans la gestion de l'aide (de Lom&eacute;), l'adoption de politiques macro-&eacute;conomiques sens&eacute;es ou la garantie d'une bonne gouvernance. La mani&egrave;re de mesurer ce type de performance risque de faire l'objet de fortes controverses.

<P>

Les options &agrave; l'&eacute;tude sont les suivantes :

<P>

<LI><B><I>Capacit&eacute; d'absorption</B></I>. Cette option est vivement critiqu&eacute;e car il s'agit d'&eacute;valuer la performance ACP sur la base d'objectifs quantitatifs (&#171; Combien d'argent  a-t-on  d&eacute;bours&eacute; ? &#187;)  plut&#244;t  que  sur  la  base de crit&egrave;res qualitatifs (&#171; Quels r&eacute;sultats a-t-on obtenus ? &#187;). L'efficacit&eacute; de la mise en oeuvre est consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme un crit&egrave;re d'&eacute;valuation plus prometteur.

<P>

<LI><B><I>Performance &eacute;conomique</B></I>. Aux termes de cette option, ceux qui enregistrent de bons r&eacute;sultats sont les pays qui prennent les r&eacute;formes macro-&eacute;conomiques au s&eacute;rieux. D'un point de vue europ&eacute;en, les normes propos&eacute;es correspondraient probablement dans une large mesure &agrave; celles des institutions de Bretton Woods (quoique avec une plus grande attention pour les dimensions sociales et autres dimensions humaines de l'ajustement). Il se peut que les pays ACP aient des opinions diff&eacute;rentes, en particulier en ce qui concerne le contenu, le rythme et la succession des r&eacute;formes.

<P>

<LI><B><I>Performance politique</B></I>. Si le concept des droits de l'homme est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un crit&egrave;re intangible, la d&eacute;mocratie ou la gouvernance, en revanche, ne font pas vraiment l'unanimit&eacute;. Les Europ&eacute;ens ayant particip&eacute; &agrave; cette &eacute;tude pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent le concept de &#171; gestion responsable des politiques&#187;, qui semble plus objectif que le concept tr&egrave;s normatif de d&eacute;mocratie. Les repr&eacute;sentants des ACP mettent en garde contre des d&eacute;finitions trop strictes d'un crit&egrave;re de ce type ; ils sont &eacute;galement sceptiques en ce qui concerne les tentatives d'&eacute;valuation, et plus encore de &#171; quantification &#187; de la performance politique.

<P>

En ce qui concerne le processus, il est essentiel d'identifier et d'appliquer conjointement les nouveaux crit&egrave;res d'allocation de l'aide. Cela n&eacute;cessite une recherche ind&eacute;pendante, un dialogue approfondi et des m&eacute;canismes institutionnels &agrave; m&ecirc;me d'assurer une mise en oeuvre et un suivi corrects.

<P>

<H4>Aller au-del&agrave; du gouvernement</H4>

<P>

<I>&#171; Les bureaucrates ne devraient plus &ecirc;tre les acteurs principaux dans les futurs partenariats UE-ACP &#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant du secteur priv&eacute; africain).</I>

<P>

L'&eacute;poque des partenariats de d&eacute;veloppement &#171; r&eacute;serv&eacute;s &#187; aux gouvernements semble d&eacute;finitivement r&eacute;volue. Cela s'est confirm&eacute; au cours des entretiens que nous avons conduits pour cette &eacute;tude. L'&eacute;crasante majorit&eacute; des personnes interrog&eacute;es au sein des ACP pense que tout nouvel accord de coop&eacute;ration doit &ecirc;tre bas&eacute; sur un partenariat pluraliste.

<P>

Ici aussi, l'&eacute;preuve critique se situe au niveau de la mise en oeuvre. Les partenaires actuels de Lom&eacute; n'ont pas l'habitude de travailler avec un grand nombre d'acteurs. Des changements d'attitude et de r&#244;les s'imposent &agrave; plusieurs niveaux ; il faut red&eacute;finir les fonctions des organismes centraux, mettre en place de nouveaux syst&egrave;mes de d&eacute;cision et de gestion, et encourager la coop&eacute;ration entre les institutions plut&#244;t que la comp&eacute;tition. Tout ceci requiert de nouvelles capacit&eacute;s &agrave; tous les niveaux (voir chapitre 6).

<P>

<H4>Clarifier les responsabilit&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes dans le nouveau partenariat</H4>

<P>

Le partenariat est une voie &agrave; double sens. Les exigences europ&eacute;ennes de meilleure gestion des affaires publiques (bonne gouvernance), de plus de transparence et de responsabilisation des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires seraient plus cr&eacute;dibles si des normes similaires &eacute;taient &eacute;galement de mise pour le partenaire donateur. Il faudra dans les ann&eacute;es &agrave; venir &eacute;laborer des moyens op&eacute;rationnels pour r&eacute;tablir la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; dans le partenariat. A cette fin, on distingue trois axes prioritaires :

<P>

<LI><B><I>Coh&eacute;rence accrue</B></I>. S'il est pris au s&eacute;rieux, le d&eacute;bat sur la coh&eacute;rence soul&egrave;ve un ensemble de questions fort complexes. Une plus grande coh&eacute;rence europ&eacute;enne peut &ecirc;tre obtenue au niveau des proc&eacute;dures, des politiques et des instruments de coop&eacute;ration (entre aide et commerce) de l'UE. Cela n&eacute;cessite que la Commission clarifie son r&#244;le sp&eacute;cifique et sa valeur ajout&eacute;e (par rapport aux 15 Etats membres). La zone la plus critique et sensible est peut-&ecirc;tre la coh&eacute;rence entre les politiques europ&eacute;ennes susceptibles d'affecter les pays en d&eacute;veloppement (les politiques agricoles, par exemple).

<h4>This Report</h4>

The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.

<p>

The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.

<p>

This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 15 June 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.

<p>

<h4>Main Points</h4>

The aid volume of the Netherlands has for a long time surpassed the United Nations target of 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) and the Dutch aid programme has set quality standards in several respects. In recent years however, volume has stagnated and there has been no growth in real terms since the mid-1980's. Volume fell 5% in real terms in 1993 and the ODA/GNP ratio has declined from 0.99% in 1987/87 to an estimated 0.81% in 1993.

<p>

 New orientations for Dutch development cooperation policy were outlined in a government white paper of 1993: "A World in Dispute." In this, maintenance and restoration of peace is advocated as an additional objective for traditional aid, particularly as a way to deal with the many "man-made" crises that now beset the world. While these orientations still need detailed work and discussion to become operational, they illustrate how one donor is re-defining its role and programme in relation to the new aid context.

<p>

In this regard, this review gives special consideration to the coherence betweeen emergency assistance and long-term development cooperation, integration of development programmes with the efforts of other government departments, the capacity of the Dutch aid administration to manage the widened programme, aid relationships with recipient countries, and improvements in the aid evaluation system.

<h3>Background</h3>



At the beginning of June 1995 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) of the

Netherlands took the initiative of submitting to the Minister for Development Cooperation, J.P. Pronk,  an

advisory document (recommendation no. 105) entitled Review of foreign policy: a changing approach to

development cooperation in a changing world. It had been prompted to do so by a meeting which had taken

place the previous October with members of the Permanent Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Lower

House of Parliament.

<p>

<h3>Determining the place of development cooperation ('Major review')</h3>



The globalisation of the world economy has not left developing countries untouched. Quite the reverse in

fact; some of these nations are at the forefront of this process. Developing countries' economies are growing

more rapidly than those of rich countries, and this trend looks set to continue. They will increasingly fuel

the progress of the global economy. The familiar socioeconomic issues have been supplemented by other

questions which are making ever more urgent calls upon our attention: these include the refugee issue,

peacekeeping, the protection of human rights, democratisation and good governance. The question posed by

the National Advisory Council focuses on whether the instruments of Dutch foreign policy are still adequate

to deal with these issues, and on their effect on development cooperation.

<p>

Some of what were formerly styled Third World countries have reached or are about to reach a stage at

which they will no longer require special treatment in international relations, such as preferential measures

in the field of trade. It is easier for them to finance their development through the international private

capital market. These countries can be held responsible for poverty alleviation within their own borders.

Official flows of capital can be concentrated on a smaller group of developing countries. This should in no

way deflect efforts from the goal of global liberalisation of the movement of goods, services and capital.

While some economies are growing rapidly, others are being left behind. The gap is growing fast. Each

year sees an increase in the number of the poor; in the seventies this was estimated at 700 million, but their

ranks have now swelled to some 1,300 million. Of this latter group, 750 million men, women and children

go hungry every day. More attention must be given than hitherto to those left behind in the race for

development, to ensure that they do not entirely lose their chance of catching up. 

<p>

The end of the Cold War has shaken the international political map up considerably. Domestic and

international conflicts have broken out, altered or stopped. Undreamt of forces have been unleashed. The

stable picture hitherto presented by the international legal order has been replaced by a dynamic which

works sometimes towards peace, but more frequently towards increasing conflict and anarchy. An urgent

need has arisen to set the parameters for economic development, such as peacekeeping operations, good

governance, domestic legal order, social development, social integration and sustainability.

<p>

The National Advisory Council believes that the aim of Dutch foreign policy should be to promote the

international legal order and to achieve a more equitable distribution of the ecoscope. Development

cooperation is one of the instruments of that policy. In addition to the above-mentioned considerations, it is

important to realise that well-regulated international relations are very much in the Netherlands' interests.

Such a situation would be to the country's advantage, but it also places upon us obligations which cannot be

shrugged off as someone else's responsibility.

<p>

Development aid has become a staple instrument of international cooperation. Some countries, such as South

Korea and Taiwan, have benefited from it in the early stages of their development. Others have failed to

develop, for various reasons. Sometimes such failure has been attributable to the country itself; sometimes,

though, it has been the result of manipulative aid. In the past, the humanitarian principle underlying aid has

sometimes been made subservient to economic or political considerations. In this respect the current

tendency to remove the barriers formerly segregating policy fields may prove very beneficial - always

assuming that such policy 'mergers' lead to behavioural changes, that is.

<p>

The field of emergency aid/peacekeeping operations is a good example of an area which would benefit from

merged policy. The many organisations active in the field are in themselves efficient bodies. Efficiency

could however be improved by creating a single liaison office for international and national organisations in

situations where speed is of the essence. At present there is no such office in the Netherlands; the

implementation of such operations is channelled through various ministries and ministers. The National

Advisory Council proposes that the possibility of a liaison office, which would be responsible for policy

preparation and decision-making, be studied.

<p>

Another effect of globalisation has been an increase in the dissemination of information. In turn this has

greatly influenced people's aspirations with regard to participation in decision-making, good governance and

protection of human rights, and it has also made them more articulate and more ready to demand their

rights. Social development should be an independent element of development cooperation. Non-

governmental organisations can do much to promote such development. Efforts should continue to focus on

the development of criteria and the setting of priorities in the entire field of political and social development.

<p>

<h3>Tasks of development cooperation ('Minor review')</h3>



The central aim of development cooperation should be structural poverty alleviation within the parameters of

sustainability and political development (good governance, human rights, democratisation and social

development). An element of enlightened self-interest is permissible here, provided that it is not hidden, that

it is controllable, that it serves a purpose, and, most importantly, that it is subordinate to the real objective.

This aim should be furthered, just as in the eighties, by allocating 0.9 percent of GNP for traditional aid,

and 0.1 percent of GNP for international cooperation in the field of the environment. This should not affect

the aid currently being given to Central and Eastern Europe; this should be covered by a different budget.

<p>

In the long term, trade relations will assume greater importance to developing countries than aid relations.

However, the National Advisory Council believes that up to now many of the pleas for 'trade, not aid' have

amounted to empty rhetoric, since they have not been linked to proposals to achieve a greater liberalisation

of trade for developing countries. The Council is of the opinion that the Netherlands should take a stand

within the European Union for a simpler preferential system which will ultimately offer only the least

developed countries completely free access for all trade products (i.e. including textiles, clothing, steel and

agricultural products), gradually excluding the somewhat less poor countries from preferential measures.

The Netherlands must moreover make extra efforts to abolish European export subsidies which lead to the

dumping of agricultural products in developing countries. The agreements made during the Uruguay Round

must be honoured. This does not detract from the fact that the Netherlands should investigate scope for

going further than the dictates or agreements proceeding from 'Brussels'. Since protectionism can always

rear up unexpectedly, it is important to adhere, in the years ahead, to the agreed steps towards liberalisation

and to resist any delay on this point.

<p>

As indicated above, the Netherlands should adhere to the commitment it made in the framework of UNCED

to make 0.1 percent of GNP available for international environmental projects. However, the National

Advisory Council does not share the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment's view that

these resources should mainly be deployed in Central and Eastern Europe and in East Asia. International

demand should take precedence over Dutch supply, here. The Council does, however, see scope for a

financial contribution to be made towards the cost of provision of Dutch expertise, say in the fields of soil

cleanup, water purification and environmental management. World Bank project funding would seem to

provide reasonable guarantees of environmental protection. The Council believes that the Netherlands should

ensure that other financial institutions, too, such as the Asian Development Bank, subject their proposals for

project financing to critical environmental assessment and that they recruit the staff necessary for such

assessment. The Dutch bilateral development aid programme should incorporate target figures for the total

amounts to be spent on environmental activities. It is important, though, to ensure that this sort of aid is not

increasingly made subject to requirements and conditions emanating from the Dutch political agenda.

<p>

Development projects come in many shapes and sizes. There is no simple formula for a successful project.

They often entail intricate intervention in complex social and political systems. A paucity of data makes it

difficult to predict the effects of such interventions (even in the Netherlands, where data are relatively

abundant, it is difficult to predict what the effects of an extra airport runway will be!). Nevertheless,

evaluation of thirty years of experience in development does provide some pointers. The provision of

development aid has worked better in Asia and Latin America than in Africa. And yet in the latter

continent, too, some successes have been achieved. Countries not torn by civil war have seen a sharp drop

in infant mortality rates, a great increase in life expectancy, great improvements in literacy rates and a far

greater number passing through higher education. These achievements are largely due to aid in the form of

vaccination campaigns, food programmes and education. The failures that have occurred have been in the

field of large-scale infrastructural projects, of industries which were technologically inappropriate and too

large in scale. The likelihood of failure increased greatly when the provision of aid became clouded by

economic interests and political motives.

<p>

The National Advisory Council feels that it is important for aid work to be done by professionals. It

recommends that an organisation's quality enhancement methods be viewed as a barometer when recruiting

bodies for aid work. To this end it will be necessary to ascertain whether they make use of independent

evaluation and reflect the results in their policy. Self-evaluation and self-criticism are qualities which are not

invariably possessed by aid agencies. The Council accordingly believes that the extent of the Netherlands'

voluntary contributions to international bodies should depend on the perceived quality of the organisation in

question and its evaluation methods. In the case of obligatory contributions the Netherlands and other

countries will have to insist that quality be adopted as the yardstick for increasing or reducing future

contributions. In theory, a wide range of NGOs qualify for aid, particularly as the Council would like to see

greater importance attached to a balanced programme of social development. It is against this background

that the Council urges a gradual increase in the share of co-financing organisations in the total development

budget. In general, these have proved an efficient aid channel, fulfilling the sustainable poverty alleviation

condition, and have in recent years worked towards quality improvement.

<p>

The Dutch economy is very much an open economy; a good proportion of our prosperity is derived from

international trade. And yet that openness is relative. Compared to other countries, our international contacts

tend to be restricted to ties with rich nations. If the sustainability of the Netherlands' links with developing

countries is to be promoted, the Council feels that new ways must be sought to intensify such relations. We

might approach other donors for advice on aid-initiated relations in the field of trade and investment.

<p>

What is the status of the quality of aid provided and the aid channels used by the Netherlands on a bilateral

basis? Over the years this has become ever more complex in nature, with a sharp increase in the number of

main aims, subordinate aims, and social and political requirements. Improvement of the quality of such aid

would, the Council believes, make both Dutch policy and the organisation of aid more transparent and

straightforward. In the interests of manageability and quality it would seem sensible to concentrate aid on a

smaller number of countries. With regard to Dutch bilateral aid, the Council is thinking in terms of ten

countries in which broad programmes of development aid could be set up, and twenty countries in which

only theme or sector programmes would be financed. The Council once again reiterates its earlier

recommendation to concentrate 80% of traditional aid in the poorest countries (with a per capita GNP of

less than USD 650). Development cooperation is very much a knowledge industry, and loss of quality and

fragmentation are inherent dangers. For this reason it is also recommended that special programmes

(environment, women, research, urban poverty, etc.) are integrated in the proposed country programmes.

The Council would stress here that it is not proposing that specific expertise in the said areas be lost, only

that it should be incorporated more effectively in the country programmes.

<p>

The quality of bilateral aid can also be enhanced through various personnel-related measures (aiming at

professionalisation) and by decentralising powers and staff. Staff recruited for the preparation, approval and

monitoring of aid should have considerable experience in the field of development cooperation. The rotation

of staff should also be restricted, in terms both of the length and location of their postings (e.g. possibly

only within regional clusters). It should also be possible to recruit personnel with both experience of

managing complex organisations and development expertise. If not, it will be necessary to consider setting

up a government agency for aid implementation. In the latter case, one will have to ensure that

implementation does not become too far removed from the Minister for Development Cooperation's political

accountability and control. Before setting up such an agency, it would be advisable to commission, in the

short term, a comparative study of other donor country practices in respect of management and the

implementation of decision-making in the field of development cooperation. Responsibility for identification,

supervision and disbursement of smaller sums should lie with the developing countries, and the Council

accordingly recommends that field offices be set up. The 'ownership' of projects and programmes could also

be better structured. The Council believes this could be achieved within the existing personnel establishment

and budget.

<p>

The new approach outlined above would, in the view of the Council, justify expansion of the Minister for

Development Cooperation's portfolio (perhaps specified under the heading of 'International Cooperation'). In

addition to his present responsibilities in the field of aid and cooperation, the minister would become

responsible for the issues relating to development cooperation, namely international trade*, the global

environment and political concerns (good governance, human rights, democratisation and social

development). In order to cope with this extended mandate, the Minister could make greater use of

professional aid agencies in the implementation of the aid programme.

<p>

* A member of the National Advisory Council has registered a formal objection to the words 'international

trade' in this recommendation.

<p>

Different topics I have ended up tackling as an NI editor have provoked
different emotions. Some issues are motivated by anger at grievous injustice
- the victimization of the world's poor, violations of human rights,
the intellectual straightjacket of fundamentalism. Others are motivated
more by a curiosity about how we look at history, what is appealing in architecture
or how the tax system works. Rivers are a bit different, a bit closer to
the heart. <BR>
<BR>


I grew up beside the St Lawrence and as a school kid in Quebec City I used
to sit on the Plains of Abraham with a tattered black notebook and an old
pair of binoculars. My purpose was to log the ships with their strange and
wonderful flags as they passed beneath that strategic citadel which had
defended the river and French North America from all comers.  Later I walked
the shores of the Gaspe, wondered at the white flashing bellies of the  Beluga
whales at the mouth of the Saganuey and followed the broad St Lawrence through
the maze of its Thousand Islands. When I saw the dead fish in the river
or was told it was no longer safe to swim, it wrenched the heart.<BR>
<BR>
Many of us are close to a river. It is a privilege that we need to cherish
and a right that people around the world are increasingly having to fight
to defend. It is surprising how much river language and metaphor infuses
our culture. The NI office during this month's  production was redolent
with it - 'rivers' was flowing nicely, one argument was a 'red herring'
another 'a diversion' and potential staff  illness was 'rough water ahead.'
 Our new designer Andrew was 'taking the plunge' on his first issue. It
is actually largely down to him if the beauty of the river combines well
in this issue with the politics of river defense. These are both key parts
to the story. It is hoped that you readers will not drown in the details
of this issue but will be swept away by a current of concern over the fate
of the world's rivers.

This report should be cited as: ECDPM. 1996. <i>Beyond Lom&#233; IV: Exploring Options for Future ACP-EU Cooperation</i>. (Policy Management Report No. 6). Maastricht: European Centre for Development Policy Management.

<p><hr><p>



<H3>Managing Lom&#233;: An Impossible Task?</H3>

<p>

<i>"Is it still worthwhile to go through all these lengthy and cumbersome

procedures?" (ACP National Authorising Officer)</i>.

<p>

On paper, the Lom&#233; Convention may be the finest and most complete

instrument of North-South cooperation ever and the flexibility of the

Lom&#233; framework may have facilitated innovative approaches and

successful programme implementation in many ACP countries. However, the

reality is not always as rosy at the operational level. Practitioners on both

sides are frustrated. They see a growing gap between the Convention's

grand ambitions and the modest achievements on the ground. They have

to work with an increasingly complex Convention, whose management

requirements and procedures have been described as "a nightmare."

<p>

The signs on the wall are there. Large amounts of money remain unspent.

There is generally a major time-lag between "commitments" and

"disbursements", a trend that can even be noticed in countries with

sufficient levels of administrative capacity. Long delays appear in different

parts of the system (in programming, tendering and execution).

Bureaucratisation is rampant. Several instruments remain largely unknown

and therefore under-utilised (decentralised cooperation). Demotivation with

regard to Lom&#233; is a reality in ACP administrations and in the EU

Delegations.

<p>

The message is clear:  discussions on the future of ACP-EU relations should

not only deal with the "big issues", but should also radically rethink the way

in which aid is implemented and the many smaller pictures are managed. A

broad range of questions needs to be addressed. How can a more simple

and user-friendly  cooperation agreement be designed? What instruments

of the current Convention need to be preserved? How can coherence in the

use of different instruments be improved? Is programming still a useful

exercise? Should the system of "co-management" be retained? Is there a

need for country-specific management approaches?  

<p>



<H3>Consensus on the Main Bottlenecks</H3>

<p>

There is little disagreement on the main management problems that

hamper effective implementation of financial and technical cooperation:

<ul>

<li>Inflation of the Convention. Over the years, the scope of the Lom&#233;

Convention has expanded dramatically. Its volume doubled, as new

principles and objectives were added -- reflecting evolving fashions in

development cooperation, such as the attention for the environment and

gender sensitivity. This inflation, however, did not reflect a consistent

development strategy, nor was it in line with the management capacities at

both the ACP and EU levels. "Digesting" Lom&#233; is an intractable problem

for many ACP countries. They tend to become increasingly dependent on

(costly) EU technical advisors working directly for the ACP government --

with the impending risk of poor ownership.

<p>

<li>Focus on instruments at the expense of strategy. The first Lom&#233;

Convention captured peoples' imaginations with its wide range of

(innovative) instruments. Successive re-negotiations were primarily

concerned with instrumental aspects (refining the application of the trade

provisions, reviewing procedures, creating new facilities). In contrast, very

little attention was given to the more fundamental debate on strategies.

This proved to be a recipe for bad development assistance. The relatively

poor record of instruments such as STABEX and the trade preferences

illustrate this. Instruments are the means to ends, not the ends themselves.

<p>

<li>Proliferation of schemes. With each new negotiation, the range of

instruments and financial schemes has widened. In a single country, the

Lom&#233; package may comprise a national indicative programme, a

regional indicative programme, financing under STABEX, SYSMIN and the

Structural Adjustment Facility, a range of small schemes (decentralised

cooperation, micro-projects) and, in some cases, food, refugee and disaster

aid. For some, it is now an "impossible mission to use such a panoply of

instruments in a coherent manner."

<p>

<li>Poorly-defined management responsibilities. Under the "equal

partnership" of the Lom&#233; Convention, responsibilities are "shared." In

practice, this often makes it difficult to know who is responsible for what.

There is now very little support for the system of "co-management" on both

sides. It is perceived as a major cause of delays in implementation (as noted

in the Post-Fiji study). In ACP countries with well-functioning governments

and sufficient capacities, it is resented as "paternalism." In countries with

poor governance or administrative capacities, "co-management" turns out

to be a fiction. Another major problem is the concentration of power in the

hands of the National Authorising Officer. This is not the best way to

promote a transparent use of resources. Non-state actors complain that the

National Indicative Programme is  often "a top secret document."

<p>

<li>Centralisation and obsession with control. Concerns for "efficiency",

"disbursements" and "outputs" have led to highly-centralised Commission

services as well as a preference for standard approaches and procedures.

This has fuelled bureaucratisation in the application of Lom&#233;

procedures. It makes it difficult for Delegations to respond effectively to

the different realities in the field. In addition, donor agencies are under

great pressure to account for every penny spent. This has led to a real

(financial) "control obsession" within the EC. Staff in one Delegation

comments that "power [in Brussels] seems to be primarily in the hands of

accountants, most of whom have never lived in a developing country and

who have defeated the innovative spirit that existed in DG VIII in the early

1980's when development-oriented Commissioners ran the place."

<p>

<li>Capacity constraints. It is now widely agreed that both parties do not

have the required capacity to play their respective roles in the Lom&#233;

partnership, nor to ensure a proper implementation. However, serious

remedial action is yet to be taken.  

</ul><p>

<h3>Priority Actions</h3>

Most of these bottlenecks have been around for a long time. Previous

reform attempts apparently failed to properly address them. This suggests

that bolder approaches are required to achieve real progress. Both the ACP

and the EU have an interest to move beyond "business as usual." The

credibility of development cooperation is at stake.

<H4>Design a user-friendly agreement</H4>

<p>

<i>"We must be more practical and produce a more compact instrument"

(ACP Ambassador).</i>

<p>

For most people involved in Lom&#233;, a simple, leaner and user-friendly

agreement is needed to make cooperation more effective. Some even argue

that "a one-page agreement would suffice, if it contained the basic terms

of cooperation."

<p>

This is a tall order. However, the underlying principles are clear. The key

words are clarity, realism, accessibility and transparency. Clarity means

unambiguous statements on the political basis of cooperation (the mutually

agreed rules of the game). Realism is necessary to define objectives and

targets that are not over-ambitious. Accessibility is needed to open EU

cooperation to non-state actors (in South and North). Putting transparency

upfront calls for a pragmatic division of management tasks between

partners.  

<p>



<H4>Reverse the logic: Put strategy first</H4>

<p>

In the view of the Commission's Reflection Group on "Partnership 2000", it

makes little sense to have yet again a major discussion on the "nitty-gritty"

aspects of instruments and procedures. This type of "mini-engineering"

approach to reforming Lom&#233; is inappropriate, taking into account

current geopolitical realities and the legitimacy crisis of (European)

development cooperation. It also fails to provide an appropriate response

to the development needs of ACP countries. In redesigning Lom&#233;, it is

important to get "back to basics." This means giving priority to strategy

before instruments and procedures. It calls for a different logic in defining

and implementing cooperation programmes. 

<p>

The Commission therefore advocates a new approach in which the main

development constraints and challenges for the different ACP countries and

regions are first identified, possible response strategies are then set out,

detailing the specific contribution the EC can provide and only then are the

implementation strategies and instruments selected.

<p>

This approach opens new perspectives for ACP countries as well. It makes it

possible to put their (differing) development needs upfront. It allows for a

serious discussion on the added-value of European development

cooperation (compared to that of bilateral and other donors). It may also

help to identify the most suitable "package of instruments" tailored to the

needs of different ACP regions and countries. 

<p>

<H4>Ensure coherence between instruments</H4>

<p>

In theory, there is nothing wrong with Lom&#233; having a wide range of

instruments. Diversity provides flexibility and allows for integrated

approaches based on a combination of different instruments. In practice,

however, few ACP countries really succeed in utilising the Lom&#233;

potential in a coherent and integrated manner. Efforts were made in recent

years to address this problem, but without much result. 

Some of the options to make future ACP-EU cooperation more coherent are:

<ul>

<li>Reduce the number of instruments. The preferred victims of such a

reduction process are the different financial schemes under the non-

programmable resources and the "incentive allocations" (such as support for

institutional and administrative reform). In the original concept, the National

Indicative Programme (NIP) was the cornerstone of Lom&#233; cooperation.

Traditionally, a major part of the European Development Fund was pre-

allocated (as a form of entitlements) to the NIP. Over the years, however,

the EU sought to increase its leverage on the use of Lom&#233; resources by

putting more money in special funds, reserved for countries that comply

with eligibility criteria. While this may have satisfied donor accountability

requirements, this "compartmentalisation" of Lom&#233; has complicated

day-to-day management.

<p>

Many EU officials feel it is necessary to resist the tendency to build more

compartments into future agreements. If anything, the number of schemes

should be drastically reduced. Others disagree with this proposal. They

favour a variety of performance related funds that are allocated to "those

who deserve it on a first-come first-serve basis." 

<p>

<li>Restore the centrality of the programming exercise. This is undoubtedly

the preferred option for many interviewees. They argue that greater

coherence is linked to the centrality of the programming exercise as the

basis for aid allocations at the national level. Instead of spreading the

money over a wide variety of separate funds - each with its own procedures

- it is preferable to pull these resources together and to integrate them in

national development policies and plans. This was why NIP's were created

twenty years ago. The ACP view is that the NIP remains as valid an

instrument as ever before. It puts the initiative in the hands of the

developing country. While ensuring predictability, it is also the instrument

"par excellence" for policy dialogue.

<p>

At first sight, this proposal looks highly attractive. On second analysis,

however, it appears that a successful application of this option depends on

prevailing local conditions. It can work in ACP countries that have well-

functioning political and economic management. If real trust between the

partners exists, the European Commission should restore the centrality of

the programming exercise and adopt a much more flexible approach in

deciding on the use of Lom&#233; resources. Depending on the specific

needs of the country, it should be possible to use the NIP to coordinate all

EC funds for investment, balance of payments aid, budget aid or debt relief.

<p>

This option seems less realistic in ACP countries confronted with political

turmoil, serious governance problems or general breakdown of

administrative capacity. It is hard to see how these countries can be

expected to genuinely identify their most pressing development needs, to

set appropriate priorities and to engage in a dialogue with the Commission

on a national programme. Concentrating money in the hands of

unaccountable governments is no longer acceptable in Europe. Direct

budgetary support cannot really be envisaged here. In these countries, a

different type of partnership will have to be nurtured, based on a different

set of instruments (for example, a small indicative programme, focused on

a limited number of sectors and subjected to high profile conditionality).

<p>

<li>Break the Convention into different parts. This option aims to achieve

greater effectiveness and coherence by breaking the Convention into

different funds, on a functional basis, to be managed independently by

different actors on the basis of their comparative advantage (applying the

principle of subsidiarity). Instead of having one Lom&#233; fund in a given

country - managed exclusively by the state - there would be several funds.

One such scenario is to have three major funds: a government fund (much

along the lines of current NIPs to ensure the execution of the government's

most functions), a private sector fund, and a poverty alleviation fund

(primarily directed to civil society organisations).

</ul>

<p>

<H4>Invent new management approaches</H4>

<p>

The following options have been proposed to overcome long-standing

bottlenecks in day-to-day management of successive conventions:

<ul>

<li>Find alternatives to co-management. As mentioned before, there is a

large consensus that "co-management" is a dead-end street. Here again, in

searching for alternatives, country differentiation seems to offer a solution.

In ACP countries with well-functioning governments, the Commission no

longer has an excuse to adopt highly centralised management approaches.

A new system needs to be devised that gives "full" responsibility for

managing Lom&#233; resources to the local partner while ensuring result-

oriented donor control. Co-management also makes little sense in countries

with poor governance or administrative capacities.

<p>

Different options can be envisaged here, according to local conditions. In

some cases, the EC may conclude that no partnership relation can be

established. In other countries, it might decide to take over part of the

management responsibilities from the ACP partner -- with the related risks

of aid dependency. If capacity constraints are the main problem (as in small

Pacific islands), the provision of institutional support may help to create the

necessary conditions for effective implementation of the development

programmes by the ACP countries themselves.

<p>

<li>Review the role of the NAO. While recognising the role of the NAO as

reference point and chief negotiator, it is generally felt that future ACP-EU

cooperation should also allow inputs from other relevant ministries and

from non-state actors. One way of doing this is to organise structured forms

of dialogue at the national level through steering committees with all the

national actors and stakeholders (government, private sector, NGO's,

researchers) to collectively decide on the use of Lom&#233; funds. A similar

structure exists in Cte d'Ivoire with the "Comit&#233; National pour la

Gestion du Programme Indicatif National." This has been effective in

identifying broad national priorities for EU cooperation. In this approach

however, the management of funds, has to remain firmly anchored in the

central bureaucracy, to the frustration of non-state actors.

<p>

<li>Channel Lom&#233; resources directly to beneficiaries. This option is

very much supported by non-state actors in ACP countries. Some favour

direct funding, without government interference. Others accept that

support to non-state actors has to be framed in a national policy

framework. Governments have a role to play in this and will, inevitably,

retain overall political and financial authority in deciding on the use of aid

resources. In their view, however, the government cannot claim a similar

role in managing (implementing) Lom&#233; programmes. At this level,

management responsibilities should be allocated to those actors best suited

to perform the tasks.

<p>

A good example is the private sector. While the public-private sector

dialogue is essential in determining national priorities and related EU

support, the management of "private sector development programmes"

should be firmly in the hands of these organisations themselves. If this

option is pursued, it should not be done in an improvised manner. There are

some potential risks that should be carefully looked at, such as the

questions of legitimacy and accountability of civil society and private sector

organisations (<a href="pmr66_gb.htm">see chapter 6</a>).

</ul>

<p>

<H4>Decentralise EC decision-making and implementation</H4>

<p>

<i>"The control obsession of the Commission is a clear symptom of an

institution in crisis. Commission staff spend most of their time with tender

procedures, payment orders, financial control. There is hardly any time left to discuss the

content of cooperation" (Technical Advisor to an NAO).</i>

<p>

Several options to overcome this long-standing problem were suggested.

<ul>

<li>Decentralisation to the field. Reinforce the Delegations and provide them with more

decision-making-responsibilities, including decisions on larger expenditures;

<p>

<li>Review the roles and responsibilities of Commission staff  in Brussels and in the field.

Instead of putting the emphasis on purely bureaucratic functions (financial control, payments

orders) staff should be much more involved in content and analytical work;

<p>

<li>Establish regional pools where the core of the Commission competence should be

concentrated and where most financial control and technical expertise should be located.

</ul>

<p>

<H4>Give a realistic mandate to the European Commission</H4>

<p>

It is increasingly acknowledged that internal EC capacity constraints are part of the

implementation problem of Lom&#233;. In any future cooperation agreement, these donor

inconsistencies should be fully addressed. While under-staffing in Brussels and the Delegations

is certainly a critical problem, the "impossible" mandate of the EC is also largely responsible.

<p>

Since Lom&#233; I, the scope of intervention of the EC has systematically broadened. The

EC is supposed to be active in all policy areas and coordinating all Lom&#233; instruments

in a coherent way. Possible reform options include:

<ul>

<li>Improve and increase staff levels. This short term minimalist approach advocates

investments in human resource policy by installing more flexibility in the recruitment of

permanent staff. In this context, more use could be made of  relevant expertise in the EU

Member States;

<p>

<li>Entrust the EC with a more realistic mandate. This is a more ambitious approach in line

with its status as a supranational organisation. This could be done by limiting the involvement

of the EC to a number of core areas where it has a positive track record. The concentration

on a small number of themes per country would make it possible for the EC to make a real

difference in the selected areas, by achieving the financial critical mass that is needed -- within

the framework of a serious policy dialogue.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of British Development Cooperation</h3>



Official British development cooperation, which started in the early 1960s, was based on the United

Kingdom's (UK) colonial legacy and a strong charitable ethic under the population. Already in the 1940s

and 1950s development approaches (in technical assistance and financial aid) for British overseas territories

evolved (amongst others the 1950 Commonwealth Plan of Colombo). In 1961 a first development

administration was created. Public support has always been strong, based on church and voluntary activities.

Well-known international NGOs, such as the Save the Children Fund and Oxfam respectively started in

1919 after World War I and as a response to the Greek famine in 1942. Opinion polls show that the British

public feels that development cooperation should not be left to voluntary organisations only, and that

government efforts could be enhanced.

<p>

In 1992 UK's net official development assistance amounted to US $ 3 217 million, which was 0.31 per cent

GNP, a fall of 3.5 per cent since 1991. The ODA/GNP ratio reached its peak in 1979 with 0.51 per cent,

and then steadily fell to 0.27 per cent in 1990, due to the UK's negative annual growth rate. Within a

growing budget for external assistance programmes for the period 1994 - 1996, the financial volume for aid

programmes to developing countries will remain unchanged (in current terms). 47 per cent of British ODA

in 1992 was disbursed through multilateral channels, of which 21 per cent through the EU. Multilateral

contributions, in the 1980s amounting to around 40 per cent of all British aid, could approach two-thirds of

the aid budget in the late 1990s, including one-third for the EU budget. After 1996 the budget for the

developing countries will not be separately identified in the overall external assistance budget, as it is

currently. The total external assistance budget includes now: aid to developing countries, aid to Central and

Eastern European Countries (CEECs), the former Soviet Union, and Global Environmental Assistance. 

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

British aid has its legislative basis in the Overseas Development and Cooperation Act of 1980, which

succeeded the 1966 Overseas Aid Act. All expenditures for development assistance must be authorised by

Parliament in additional legislation. With the establishment of the Department for Technical Cooperation in

1961 all Third World expertise, spread over several Ministries, was concentrated in one organisation. Since

then, many changes and reorganisations of the development administration have been implemented (1964,

1970, 1974, 1979), strongly influenced by the UK's changes of Government.

<p>

Since 1979, aid is administered by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA). A Minister for

Development Cooperation, who holds the position of Foreign and Commonwealth Minister of State, heads

the Overseas Development Administration and is under responsibility of the Foreign Secretary. The ODA is

located within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). It manages the three components of the British

external assistance programme: global environmental assistance, overseas aid to developing countries (the

main component), and assistance to Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union (managed

jointly with the Diplomatic Wing). The latter two are to merge after 1996. ODA is responsible for

multilateral aid, including contributions to the World Bank group and the EU.  

<p>

ODA is responsible for policy formulation and implementation. Actual implementation is delegated to

various types of institutions. Six Development Divisions play an important role in planning and managing

bilateral aid; these are located in Kenya, Barbados, Malawi, Zambia, Thailand and Pretoria. In addition

there are two Aid Management Offices (in Dhaka and the Pacific Islands). Staff based in Embassies and

High Commissions in Commonwealth countries assist in administering aid programmes. The Natural

Resource Institute (NRI), the scientific arm of British aid, conducts research, consultancies and evaluations.

The NRI is part of the aid administration and is directly responsible to the Minister for Development

Cooperation. The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), a government funded public

corporation, is the main instrument for assisting the private sector in developing countries. Crown Agents

for Overseas Governments and Administration provide procurement and management services to

governments of developing countries, to the UK and other donors. In formulation, implementation and

evaluation of development policy, the Government cooperates with NGOs, research institutes and private

enterprise. 

<p>

Allocations of responsibility, at ministerial as well as on administrative level, between the Aid

Administration on the one hand and the Foreign Policy Departments of the FCO and the Treasury on the

other, traditionally have been subjects of regular discussions. Various mechanisms for internal and external

coordination and consultation have been created, in order to achieve compromises between the above

mentioned organisations. British practice allows ministers to interfere in each other's affairs. The main

interministerial instrument for consultation and coordination of aid policy is the Joint Aid Policy Committee

(JAPC). This Committee includes representatives of ODA, the Diplomatic Wing of the FCO, the Treasury,

the Bank of England, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the Export Credit Guarantee

Department (ECGD).

<p>

The Aid Policy Department within the Finance Division of the ODA is the central section for policy

planning within the FCO. As in the Aid Policy Department, officials from ODA and the Diplomatic Wing

take counsel in the Aid Policy Board and the Aid Policy Management Group. Policy planning for

development cooperation of the EU is done by the European Community and Food Aid Department in the

International Division of the ODA. In addition the Prime Minister may install Sub-committees.

<p>

Over the years several White Papers (1963, 1975) have been formulated by the Government. In 1975 the

white paper on development cooperation, More Help for the Poorest, was published, on which current

British aid objectives are based. After UNCED, the Strategy for Sustainable Development was published,

with which all development strategies forthwith have to be consistent. Policy objectives are further

elaborated in Sector Policy Papers, in Country Objective Papers and Country Review Papers, commitment

targets, strategy papers for technology development and transfer, and corporate plans. Programmes are

considerably scrutinised and regularly evaluated, amongst others by the independently operating Evaluation

Department of the ODA. Some of these documents are published.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

In the UK there was never felt a need for a formally organised advisory body for development cooperation.

Firstly, over the years a large network of officials and experts developed. Within this network the function

of an advisory body seems to be 

accounted for. Secondly, the Overseas Development Administration has a large number of professional

advisors and sector specialists. Additionally, the Minister and the administration have regular formal

contacts with a wide range of NGOs and academic institutions in the UK. In the United Kingdom a wealth

of knowledge and experience on development cooperation is made available through its many institutes. In

fact, it were renowned economists at British Universities - and in ODA - that since the 1960s elaborated

development theory and strategies.

<p>

The annual external assistance budget is submitted to Parliament and actively discussed as an integral part of

the total government budget. Several Standing Committees, such as the Standing Committee on Foreign

Affairs, the Estimates Committee, and Select Committees scrutinise government proposals. The House of

Lords as well as the House of Commons regularly publish extensive reports and studies on development

cooperation issues.

<p>

In order to be better informed, back-benchers in Parliament have organised themselves separately from the

existing Committee on Foreign Affairs, in an All Party Parliamentarian Group on Overseas Development

(APPGOOD) in 1984. The group has contacts with researchers and other experts and occasionally organises

meetings and seminars.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

Among the research and development institutes the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and the Institute

for Development Studies (IDS) are considered as the leading institutes, in particular on 'European issues'.

Publications of this institutes are widely available. The Intermediate Technology Development Group

(ITDG) is one of the leading institutes in development and transfer of technology. According to the 1991

OECD/EADI survey a total of 71 institutes qualifies as Development Research and Training Institutes.

<p>

Following the publication of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development, the Government announced

to set up a three level consultation structure in the UK for the continuation of the UNCED-process: a

Citizens Council, an informal Round Table Group, and an Advisory Panel to the Government, consisting of

eminent members of society.

<p>

The NGO development community in the UK, of which many started as church-based organisations, is one

of the strongest and oldest in Europe. NGOs in Britain actively search the policy dialogue with the

government, and vice versa. Working through NGOs is one of the fastest growing aspects of the British aid

programme. Of the approximately 300 British NGOs 100 receive government support (1992). Four large

NGOs cooperate with the Government in the British Voluntary Service Programme for personnel assistance

overseas. In 1993 an umbrella organisation was created: British Overseas NGOs for Development (BOND),

in which some 80 NGOs are represented. BOND was purposely created to encourage policy discussions,

coordination, to create a two way flow of information between the ODA and the NGOs, and to intensify

government cooperation with NGOs. Other NGO umbrella organisations for lobbying on aid policy issues

are a.o. the Human Rights and Development Forum, the National Association of Womens Organisations and

the Aid and Environment Group.

<p>

Topics of concern of the NGOs in the discussion with the Government are a.o. maintaining the UK's

volume for ODA, commercialisation of aid, the growing volume required for emergency aid, and

availability of operational information on government programmes.

<a name="org"></a><hr><h3>Organisation of Danish Development Cooperation</h3>



Danish official development assistance, which started in the early 1960s, was based on political, economic,

and charitable motives. According to an opinion poll of February 1993 80 per cent of the population has a

positive attitude towards development assistance. The Government is in the process of expanding the support

base for development cooperation in Danish society. For cooperation in policy formulation, the organisation

of aid and its implementation contacts are being built up between the Government, business and industry,

trade unions, voluntary and professional organisations, research institutions and public sector institutions. 

<p>

Denmark's net official development assistance amounted to US $ 1.392 million in 1992, which was 1.02 per

cent of GNP, increasing slightly to 1.03 per cent in 1993. Since the 1960s disbursements of development aid

have been divided rather equally between bilateral and multilateral channels. In 1992 multilateral aid

constituted 41 per cent of the ODA. An additional 6 per cent of ODA was channelled through the EU. In

1993 ODA will amount to 0,97 per cent of GNP.

<p>

Development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy. In the light of global political changes,

Denmark is in the process of evaluating its experiences and adjusting its international development policy

and the organisation of its aid programme. The main objectives of a new policy are laid down in the 1994

strategy plan 'A Developing World, Strategy for Danish Development Policy towards the Year 2000'. 

<p>

Since DANIDA's (Danish International Development Assistance) Plan of Action of 1988, Denmark is in the

process of reducing the number of programme countries from 67 to 20 in 1994. Over half of the bilateral

aid is directed towards Africa (1992). Aid to Asia has declined in 1992, while allocations for Latin

America, for non-country specific aid and for receiving refugees in Denmark have risen. 

<p>

Per programme country a long term strategy is to be elaborated. In 1989 Parliament choose three new

criteria for the selection of programme countries: the potential for poverty alleviation, the potential to

influence development policy, and the potential for Danish business interests.

<p>

<a name="ins"><hr><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

Danish official development assistance is based on the 1971 International Development Cooperation Act and

has since been laid down in many strategy and policy papers. Since 1990 the Danish Ministry of Foreign

Affairs has been divided into two separate pillars: a North Group and a South Group (the latter covering the

developing countries). Thus reflecting a geographical integration of all relevant international cooperation

components rather than the traditional functional one. DANIDA ceased to exist, although the name is still

used for the South group. The regional sub-divisions in the two groups are responsible for all aspects of

Denmark's bilateral relations with a given country: political, aid, economic, and commercial relations. Since

the beginning of 1993, the Ministry is not only headed by a Minister of Foreign Affairs but also by a

Minister for Development Cooperation. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is responsible for EU policies,

including EU development aid policies. The administration is not only responsible for policy formulation,

but also for implementation. 

<p>

Within the South Group in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a Division for the General Coordination of

Development Assistance is responsible for policy planning. The Ministry of Finance also participates in the

formulation of Denmark's aid policy. Additionally, under the Environmental Framework arrangements have

been made with the Ministry of Environment for the policy development and funding of environmental

protection assistance to specific countries. It is not known wether these arrangements have been finalised,

nor into what detail. Priorities for the distribution and the use of the funds of all Danish international

cooperation will be worked out annually by a interministerial committee.

<p>

In March 1994 the new comprehensive strategy plan, A Developing World, Strategy for Danish

Development Policy towards the Year 2000, was presented and approved by Parliament. A summary is

translated into English. Sector, country and overall policy papers generally are published and translated into

English and made available to a wide public.

<p>

Evaluations are conducted frequently, on projects and programmes, themes and such components as NGO

development cooperation and on multilateral aid. Many evaluations are conducted by external consultants

and firms. Feedback to DANIDA's operational units is done through informal discussions. Since 1982 a

relatively small evaluation unit was created within DANIDA. Its autonomy has recently been strengthened.

Evaluation reports are being summarised and published in order to inform the Danish public.

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

There are two advisory bodies for development cooperation policies: the Council for International

Development Cooperation (R&#229;det), which focuses on policy and the Board for International

Development Cooperation (Styrelsen), that focuses on policies and projects. This is a very common structure

in Scandinavian countries. The members of both bodies are appointed by the Minister for Development

Cooperation. Council and Board have a common secretariat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the person

of an official of the Policy Planning Division. The secretaryship of both Council and Board is a part time

occupation. Results of the discussions in the Council and the Board are not published.

<p>

Both Council and Board are established according to the 1971 International Development Act. The formal

mandate of the Council is to follow the Board's activities.

<p>

<h4>The Council for International Development Cooperation</h4>

<p>

The Council has 75 members, appointed for three year periods. They represent all sections in Danish society

that have an interest in development cooperation: representatives of church-organisations, industry and

agriculture, trade unions, the sciences, banking, development NGOs, ministries, as well as individual

experts on development cooperation, and members of Parliament.

<p>

In addition to following the Board's activities, the Council also is formally appointed to discuss the annual

budget before it is sent to Parliament. Furthermore the Council discusses policy plans in their final stage

before they are sent to Parliament, and it reviews development activities on the basis of the formulated

policies. The 1994 Strategy Plan for the Year 2000 for instance was discussed with the Council before it

was officially published and sent to Parliament.

<p>

The Council meets about six times a year, of which one meeting is spent on discussing the annual report of

the Board, and another on discussing the annual budget for development cooperation. The Council is a body

for consultation, that discusses policy matters with the Minister; it does not write recommendations.

Council-meetings are chaired by the Minster for Development Cooperation. The press can be present at

these meetings. Amongst other things, the Council appears to function as a platform for discussion with all

parties involved in development cooperation. 

<p>

<h4>The Board for International Development Cooperation</h4>

<p>

The Board has nine members, appointed for three year periods. Members are representatives of the private

sector, business, industry, and consultancy, as well as representatives of NGOs, and the research

community. They are appointed on the basis of their personal capacity.

<p>

The mandate of the Board is to assess those projects and programmes of DANIDA that exceed 5 million

Danish Krona. Additionally it discusses development cooperation policies, in a similar way as the Council

does. Like the Council, the Board receives policy plans in their final stage before they are sent to

Parliament. The Board meets at least once a month. It cannot take up subjects at its own initiative.

Otherwise than the Council, the Board appears to be quite involved in the internal administrative process of

handling aid projects and programmes. 

<p>

Parliament has a standing Committee for Foreign Affairs that also deals with development cooperation

matters. Parliament as well as the Committee are very actively involved in development cooperation.

<p>

Until the beginning of the 1990s a Nordic Council of the Ministers of Development Cooperation of

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden met bi-annually to discuss policy issues. Adjacent to these

meetings advisory meetings were organised of parliamentarians and researchers from the five countries. One

of these advisory meetings was a seminar Human Rights and Democracy held in Helsinki. The proceedings

were published in English. It is not known whether these meetings will be continued.

<p>

<HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

In 1992 almost 20 per cent of the Danish bilateral programme was disbursed through NGOs. The eight

largest organisations received 86 per cent. The Ministry maintains an active policy dialogue with the NGO-

community, amongst others on the increasing involvement of Danish Industry, the financing of the reception

of refugees in Denmark and of increasing emergency aid. 

<p>

According to a 1991 OECD survey in Denmark ten institutes qualify as 'Development Research and

Training Institutes'. In 1969 Parliament established by act of law the Centre for Development Research

(CDR), based in Copenhagen. It is an independent institute financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The

Centre undertakes many consultancy studies and research work for the Ministry. 

<p>

Denmark also has a Research Council. It advises the Evaluation and Research Department of the South

Group in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on research and evaluation. The Council has 15 members who are

appointed for a two year period. 

<p>

The Danish business community will become increasingly involved in the formulation of development

strategies and the identification of programmes amongst others through annual meetings with DANIDA.

Pistes de r&eacute;flexion sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE</i>. (Rapport No. 6). Maastricht: Centre Europ&#233;en de Gestion des Politiques de D&#233;veloppement.

<HR><P>

<P>

<H3>La fin d'une &eacute;poque</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171; C'est la derni&egrave;re Convention telle que nous la connaissons &#187; (M. Pinheiro, commissaire europ&eacute;en, Dakar, f&eacute;vrier 1995).</I>

<P>

Ces paroles du commissaire europ&eacute;en charg&eacute; du d&eacute;veloppement illustrent bien les craintes et les souhaits de nombreuses personnes &eacute;troitement impliqu&eacute;es dans le fonctionnement de la Convention de Lom&eacute;. D'aucuns estiment que la Convention ne r&eacute;pond plus aux attentes formul&eacute;es il y a vingt ans. D'autres observent une modification inqui&eacute;tante des politiques europ&eacute;ennes et affirment que la sauvegarde des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences et du soutien apport&eacute;s par Lom&eacute; est cruciale pour leur propre d&eacute;veloppement et leur survie.

<P>

Entre ces deux opinions extr&ecirc;mes s'&eacute;tend une zone interm&eacute;diaire de plus en plus vaste r&eacute;unissant des observateurs qui, tout en reconnaissant que le b&eacute;b&eacute; ne va pas tr&egrave;s bien, estiment que les raisons abondent pour ne pas le jeter avec l'eau du bain.

<P>

<H4>La perte de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t port&eacute; &agrave; Lom&eacute;...</H4>

<P>

Le d&eacute;clin manifeste de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t accord&eacute; par l'Europe &agrave; ses partenaires ACP inqui&egrave;te ceux qui, dans les pays ACP et en Europe, en mesurent l'importance. Quelles sont donc les origines du probl&egrave;me ? Les relations de l'Europe avec les soixante-dix pays ACP sont victimes des profonds changements &eacute;conomiques et g&eacute;opolitiques survenant actuellement. La fin de la guerre froide et le d&eacute;veloppement rapide d'un march&eacute; mondial ont accru la marginalisation des pays ACP. La fin de l'emprise sovi&eacute;tique sur l'Europe de l'Est, le rel&acirc;chement de la rivalit&eacute; Est-Ouest, les efforts d'union politique europ&eacute;enne et les pressions migratoires en provenance de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e ont fondamentalement modifi&eacute; les donn&eacute;es de base de la politique ext&eacute;rieure de l'UE. Celle-ci est en pleine red&eacute;finition et la place des pays ACP dans une nouvelle configuration des relations ext&eacute;rieures de l'UE &agrave; la veille de l'an 2000 est loin d'&ecirc;tre certaine.

<P>

La plupart des observateurs s'attendent &agrave; une r&eacute;trocession des ACP sur la liste des r&eacute;gions prioritaires de l'UE comme a pu l'indiquer la r&eacute;cente ren&eacute;gociation du protocole financier lors de la r&eacute;vision &agrave; mi-parcours de Lom&eacute; IV. En effet, peu d'Etats membres &eacute;taient dispos&eacute;s &agrave; maintenir leurs contributions au Fonds europ&eacute;en de d&eacute;veloppement (FED) et encore moins &agrave; les augmenter. Certains ont lutt&eacute; pour une r&eacute;duction de leur contribution et ont obtenu gain de cause. Ces discussions difficiles refl&egrave;tent un scepticisme, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute; en Europe, &agrave; propos de la valeur d'une relation vieille de vingt ans, et un manque d'enthousiasme pour sa poursuite au-del&agrave; de l'an 2000.

<P>

Outre ces facteurs, le sentiment ne cesse de cro&icirc;tre que les fondements m&ecirc;mes de la Convention ne sont plus aussi solides qu'autrefois. 

<P>

<LI><I>Perte de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; et d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun</I>. A l'&eacute;poque de la signature de la premi&egrave;re Convention de Lom&eacute; en 1975, il existait des liens historiques forts et des interd&eacute;pendances visibles entre les anciennes colonies et les neuf Etats membres de la CEE. Depuis lors, la raison d'&ecirc;tre de cette relation particuli&egrave;re dispara&icirc;t sans &ecirc;tre remplac&eacute;e par de nouvelles motivations fortes. 

<P>

<LI><I>Contestation de l'impact de Lom&eacute; sur le d&eacute;veloppement</I>. Au cours des derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, l'efficacit&eacute; de la Convention de Lom&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; s&eacute;rieusement mise en doute. En d&eacute;pit du manque de preuves concr&egrave;tes des r&eacute;sultats de Lom&eacute;, les critiques continuent d'affirmer que la Convention est devenue une partie du probl&egrave;me plut&#244;t que sa solution. Ils pr&eacute;tendent, notamment, que Lom&eacute; perp&eacute;tue la d&eacute;pendance des ACP &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'Union europ&eacute;enne, qu'elle favorise le paternalisme et le client&eacute;lisme plut&#244;t que le partenariat et que, loin de permettre aux ACP d'avoir voix au chapitre en ce qui concerne l'utilisation des ressources de d&eacute;veloppement, la Commission europ&eacute;enne prend, la plupart du temps, la direction des op&eacute;rations lors de la prise de d&eacute;cision et de la mise en oeuvre.

<P>

<LI><I>Fatigue de l'aide</I>. L'opinion publique europ&eacute;enne se demande de plus en plus pourquoi elle devrait fournir de l'aide alors que ses propres soci&eacute;t&eacute;s sont confront&eacute;es &agrave; d'importants probl&egrave;mes &eacute;conomiques et sociaux. Pourtant, des sondages d'opinion r&eacute;cemment effectu&eacute;s dans les Etats membres de l'UE montrent que l'opinion publique approuve toujours l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement, pourvu que sa bonne utilisation et son efficacit&eacute; soient d&eacute;montr&eacute;es.

<P>

<LI><I>Impr&eacute;cision du r&#244;le et de la place de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de la CE</I>. Apr&egrave;s plus de trente ans, une politique europ&eacute;enne de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement a progressivement vu le jour et la Convention de Lom&eacute; en est le pivot. Pourtant, bien que le trait&eacute; de Maastricht inclue des articles portant sur la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement, une grande partie de l'&eacute;lan a &eacute;t&eacute; perdue. La confusion ne cesse de cro&icirc;tre en ce qui concerne les r&#244;les que la CE devrait jouer dans ce domaine aux c&#244;t&eacute;s des programmes d'aide bilat&eacute;raux des Etats membres. Certains Etats membres sont partisans d'un mandat r&eacute;duit de la Communaut&eacute; et, par cons&eacute;quent, exercent des pressions sur la Convention de Lom&eacute;. On constate, d&egrave;s lors, une tendance &agrave; la renationalisation de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de la CE.

<P>

<H4>... exige que les Etats ACP se pr&eacute;parent minutieusement &agrave; l'avenir</H4>

<P>

Face &agrave; de telles pressions exerc&eacute;es sur la Convention, les pays ACP sont bien d&eacute;cid&eacute;s &agrave; ne pas adopter une attitude attentiste. D'ici &agrave; 1998, on a le temps d'articuler une nouvelle raison d'&ecirc;tre pour le futur cadre de coop&eacute;ration. Celui-ci devrait &ecirc;tre &agrave; la hauteur des fonctions qu'il est cens&eacute; remplir dans le monde d'aujourd'hui. Si tel n'est pas le cas, le partenariat ACP-UE continuera &agrave; s'effriter et il faudra s&eacute;rieusement examiner si les pays ACP, dans leur diversit&eacute; croissante, ont int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; d&eacute;fendre les dispositions actuelles de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

Des deux c&#244;t&eacute;s, les responsables se rendent compte que le temps est venu d'engager un d&eacute;bat constructif. Du c&#244;t&eacute; europ&eacute;en, la Commission expose ses id&eacute;es dans un livre vert pr&eacute;sent&eacute; en novembre 1996. Du c&#244;t&eacute; ACP, le Comit&eacute; des ambassadeurs s'est lanc&eacute; dans un processus de r&eacute;flexion parall&egrave;le pour &ecirc;tre pr&ecirc;t &agrave; temps pour le sommet des chefs d'Etats et de gouvernements ACP pr&eacute;vu en octobre 1997. Des forums communs, tels que l'Assembl&eacute;e paritaire et le Comit&eacute; &eacute;conomique et social des Communaut&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes ont &eacute;largi le d&eacute;bat. Ailleurs, on observe une augmentation du nombre des r&eacute;unions, s&eacute;minaires et initiatives de recherche organis&eacute;s sur le m&ecirc;me th&egrave;me. Le rythme s'acc&eacute;l&egrave;re.

<P>

Tout ce d&eacute;ploiement d'activit&eacute;s devrait &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s r&eacute;confortant. Cependant, dans certaines parties du monde, dans la plupart des pays ACP pour &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;cis, les d&eacute;bats ne font que commencer. Ce rapport et le programme sur lequel il s'appuie visent &agrave; contribuer &agrave; cet int&eacute;r&ecirc;t qui ne fait que na&icirc;tre. Du point de vue de l'ECDPM, il est essentiel que les opinions des parties prenantes des ACP s'expriment et soient int&eacute;gr&eacute;es dans le processus de r&eacute;flexion et dans le d&eacute;bat.

<P>

<A HREF="../lome/postl_fr.htm"><H3>L'initiative de l'ECDPM</H3></a>

<P>

Vers le milieu de l'ann&eacute;e 1995, l'ECDPM a entam&eacute; un programme de consultations et de visites visant &agrave; la fois &agrave; recueillir les opinions des ACP et des autres acteurs, et &agrave; stimuler une r&eacute;flexion ind&eacute;pendante dans les pays ACP. L'objectif g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &eacute;tait de favoriser des d&eacute;bats constructifs sur l'avenir des relations ACP-UE dans lequels les diff&eacute;rents acteurs ACP pourraient exprimer leurs opinions et &ecirc;tre &eacute;cout&eacute;s. 

<P>

La premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape consistait &agrave; informer nos interlocuteurs dans les pays ACP des probl&eacute;matiques d&eacute;battues en Europe, &agrave; recueillir leurs opinions quant &agrave; l'avenir des relations ACP-UE et &agrave; r&eacute;percuter ces opinions dans le d&eacute;bat europ&eacute;en. Des consultations se sont tenues dans quelque 20 pays situ&eacute;s dans toutes les r&eacute;gions ACP (voir annexe 6). Au cours de cette vaste op&eacute;ration de collecte d'informations dans les pays ACP, des &eacute;changes de vues ont eu lieu avec les acteurs cl&eacute;s : administrations publiques, organisations repr&eacute;sentant les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du secteur priv&eacute;, organisations non gouvernementales, centres de recherche, organisations r&eacute;gionales et d&eacute;l&eacute;gations de l'UE.

<P>

Parall&egrave;lement &agrave; cette approche ciblant les ACP, des relations ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tablies avec les d&eacute;cideurs europ&eacute;ens ainsi qu'avec d'autres parties prenantes europ&eacute;ennes &agrave; ce d&eacute;bat. Enfin, une conf&eacute;rence a &eacute;t&eacute; organis&eacute;e &agrave; Maastricht en juin 1996 r&eacute;unissant les deux courants de r&eacute;flexion (ACP et europ&eacute;en). L'exp&eacute;rience fut tr&egrave;s enrichissante pour les deux c&#244;t&eacute;s. Elle a permis aux participants provenant du groupe ACP d'appr&eacute;hender les &eacute;volutions des opinions europ&eacute;ennes en la mati&egrave;re et aux europ&eacute;ens de mieux saisir les r&eacute;alit&eacute;s du terrain. Ce fut, enfin, l'occasion d'un &eacute;change de vues direct et informel entre les ACP et les Europ&eacute;ens.

<P>

Outre la coordination g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'initiative, les t&acirc;ches assum&eacute;es par l'ECDPM ont &eacute;t&eacute; les suivantes :

<P>

<LI><I>Information des groupes cibles ACP sur les enjeux du d&eacute;bat </I>&agrave; travers des &eacute;changes de vues avec les ambassadeurs ACP aupr&egrave;s de l'UE, des missions sur le terrain, et la diffusion d'un bulletin d'information et d'articles s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;s sur la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE.

<P>

<LI><I>Implication des groupes cibles ACP dans la r&eacute;flexion </I>sous la forme de contributions &eacute;crites (voir annexe 3) ou d'autres types d'activit&eacute;s (s&eacute;minaires).

<P>

<LI><I>Mobilisation de l'expertise</I>. Des personnalit&eacute;s reconnues en Europe et dans les ACP ont &eacute;t&eacute; consult&eacute;es, et des chercheurs ont &eacute;t&eacute; invit&eacute;s &agrave; concentrer leurs recherches sur les probl&eacute;matiques de la future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE.

<P>

<LI><I>Liaison avec les parties prenantes europ&eacute;ennes</I>. Des ONG et des associations du secteur priv&eacute; ont travaill&eacute; en &eacute;troite collaboration avec l'ECDPM et des efforts ont &eacute;t&eacute; faits pour toucher le grand public par le biais d'Internet.

<P>

<LI><I>Liaison avec les d&eacute;cideurs</I>, par l'information des institutions europ&eacute;ennes et des Etats membres sur les progr&egrave;s et les r&eacute;sultats de l'initiative.

<P>

<LI><I>Mise en commun des id&eacute;es</I>. Une fois le terrain balis&eacute; c&#244;t&eacute; ACP et c&#244;t&eacute; europ&eacute;en, les deux courants se sont engag&eacute;s dans un d&eacute;bat plus vaste lors de la conf&eacute;rence de juin 1996.

<P>

<H3>Echos du terrain</H3>

<P>

Au terme de la p&eacute;riode de consultation, l'&eacute;quipe de l'ECDPM ressentait deux fortes impressions. Elles sont &eacute;voqu&eacute;es ici non pas dans l'espoir que ce rapport puisse y apporter des r&eacute;ponses d&eacute;finitives, mais dans le but d'encourager d'autres efforts de la part de tous ceux qui participent &agrave; ce d&eacute;bat.

<P>

<LI><I>Le manque d'information</I>. Dans l'ensemble, le niveau des connaissances portant sur la Convention et sur ce qu'elle offre est assez faible. La v&eacute;ritable compr&eacute;hension de la Convention semble r&eacute;serv&eacute;e &agrave; quelques responsables dans chaque pays, qui sont charg&eacute;s de la gestion au jour le jour des financements apport&eacute;s par Lom&eacute;. On peut en partie attribuer ces lacunes &agrave; un manque d'ouverture des gouvernements, &agrave; la nature complexe de la Convention et &agrave; une strat&eacute;gie de l'UE et de ses d&eacute;l&eacute;gations peu d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e en mati&egrave;re d'information. Un effort concert&eacute; important est n&eacute;cessaire pour diffuser l'information relative &agrave; Lom&eacute; au-del&agrave; des bureaux des ordonnateurs nationaux (ON) pr&eacute;sents dans chaque Etat ACP. Elle doit surtout &ecirc;tre dirig&eacute;e vers les minist&egrave;res techniques et sectoriels et vers les nombreuses organisations non gouvernementales et priv&eacute;es o&ugrave; le niveau des connaissances semble &ecirc;tre le plus bas.

<P>

<LI><I>La motivation pour prendre part au d&eacute;bat</I>. Les personnes consult&eacute;es dans les pays ACP s'inqui&eacute;taient de savoir si leurs contributions et leurs id&eacute;es auraient le moindre impact et si l'UE accorderait vraiment une quelconque attention aux opinions ainsi exprim&eacute;es. Il est difficile de r&eacute;pondre &agrave; cette interrogation l&eacute;gitime. Les fonctionnaires de la Commission europ&eacute;enne et les repr&eacute;sentants des Etats membres semblent, en tous cas, &ecirc;tre r&eacute;ceptifs et s'int&eacute;resser &agrave; un grand d&eacute;bat. La balle est, d&egrave;s lors, dans le camp des op&eacute;rateurs des pays ACP : c'est &agrave; eux d'avoir de bonnes id&eacute;es et de faire des propositions pratiques qui incitent les d&eacute;cideurs et fonctionnaires &agrave; accorder leur attention.

<P>

Une partie du probl&egrave;me r&eacute;side peut-&ecirc;tre dans le fait que les responsables ont autrefois rencontr&eacute; un manque d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t pour Lom&eacute; dans les pays ACP (ce qui est bien compr&eacute;hensible vu le manque d'information). Ils ne s'attendent gu&egrave;re &agrave; ce que les pays ACP eux-m&ecirc;mes, et encore moins leurs communaut&eacute;s non officielles, soient sources de nouvelles id&eacute;es. Nos consultations montrent cependant qu'il existe une grande r&eacute;serve d'enthousiasme et d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, bien souvent inutilis&eacute;e, qui attend d'&ecirc;tre exploit&eacute;e. La plupart des personnes rencontr&eacute;es, en particulier dans le secteur priv&eacute; et dans la communaut&eacute; des ONG, et parfois aussi au sein des parlements, sont tr&egrave;s int&eacute;ress&eacute;es et d&eacute;sirent vivement participer. Certaines se sont engag&eacute;es &agrave; pousser le d&eacute;bat &agrave; leur niveau national. Dans la majorit&eacute; des cas, il suffit, pour mobiliser cet enthousiasme, de quelques actions concr&egrave;tes, de quelques invitations &agrave; r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir et &agrave; conseiller, d'une volont&eacute; manifeste d'&eacute;couter et d'un engagement &agrave; ouvrir le d&eacute;bat.

<P>

<H3>Ce rapport</H3>

<P>

Ce rapport a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tabli sur la base de l'ensemble du processus de consultation et de discussion. Il repr&eacute;sente litt&eacute;ralement des centaines d'opinions, de points de vue et d'exp&eacute;riences expos&eacute;s par des acteurs ACP et europ&eacute;ens dans le cadre d'entretiens officiels, de discussions informelles, d'&eacute;tudes de recherche, de d&eacute;bats anim&eacute;s en petits groupes et m&ecirc;me par le biais du courrier &eacute;lectronique. Par souci de lisibilit&eacute;, les opinions ne sont pas attribu&eacute;es individuellement mais int&eacute;gr&eacute;es dans le corps du texte. L'objectif est de pr&eacute;senter les diff&eacute;rentes probl&eacute;matiques de mani&egrave;re succincte, d'exposer les opinions exprim&eacute;es et de mettre en &eacute;vidence les propositions qui se sont d&eacute;gag&eacute;es.

<P>

Au cours de toutes ces discussions, plusieurs th&egrave;mes majeurs &eacute;taient fr&eacute;quemment abord&eacute;s, trouvant un &eacute;cho dans l'esprit de la plupart des auditeurs. Ces th&egrave;mes ont servi de cadre aux discussions de la conf&eacute;rence de juin et de structure au pr&eacute;sent rapport.

<P>

Le <A HREF="pmr62_fr.htm">chapitre 2</A> examine comment identifier les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs et les motivations de l'UE pour soutenir les pays ACP. La raison d'&ecirc;tre historique s'est effrit&eacute;e, l'importance commerciale des pays ACP n'est pas assez tangible et les arguments relevant de la solidarit&eacute; semblent fragiles. Comment peut-on trouver ou cr&eacute;er un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t r&eacute;ciproque &eacute;clair&eacute; afin de poursuivre une coop&eacute;ration &eacute;quilibr&eacute;e et &agrave; long terme?

<P>

Le <A HREF="pmr63_fr.htm">chapitre 3</A> se penche sur les perspectives de pr&eacute;servation du groupe ACP. Sur ce point, les attitudes sont tr&egrave;s ambigu&euml;s. De nombreuses personnes mettent en doute la coh&eacute;rence et la pertinence du groupe ACP tout en craignant la perte des privil&egrave;ges qui y sont associ&eacute;s.

<P>

Le <A HREF="pmr64_fr.htm">chapitre 4</A> traite des types d'accords commerciaux qui pourraient convenir au nouvel environnement commercial international. Les r&eacute;gimes commerciaux de Lom&eacute;, dans le cadre &agrave; la fois des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences et des protocoles, ne semblent pas en accord avec la nouvelle lib&eacute;ralisation des &eacute;changes. Il faut trouver des moyens de concilier les besoins des pays ACP et les obligations de l'UE &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC).

<P>

Le <A HREF="pmr65_fr.htm">chapitre 5</A> passe en revue les fa&ccedil;ons dont on peut adapter le concept de partenariat &agrave; la r&eacute;alit&eacute;. En effet, le partenariat &eacute;tait la valeur la plus innovatrice et la plus appr&eacute;ci&eacute;e de la Convention. Mais la pratique a &eacute;t&eacute; assez d&eacute;cevante. Comment peut-on renverser la tendance et revitaliser le partenariat ?

<P>

Le <A HREF="pmr66_fr.htm">chapitre 6</A> a pour objet l'&eacute;largissement de la coop&eacute;ration &agrave; des acteurs non &eacute;tatiques tels que le secteur priv&eacute; et les ONG. Selon eux, la Convention de Lom&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; trop longtemps entre les mains des gouvernements. Une telle emprise s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;e inefficace et, en outre, elle ne r&eacute;pond pas aux red&eacute;finitions actuelles du r&#244;le de l'Etat dans le d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

Le <A HREF="pmr67_fr.htm">chapitre 7</A> rend compte de la recherche de moyens destin&eacute;s &agrave; am&eacute;liorer la gestion globale de la coop&eacute;ration. Si la Convention est extr&ecirc;mement riche en instruments, on ne tire g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pas assez parti des possibilit&eacute;s qu'elle offre.

<P>

Le <A HREF="pmr68_fr.htm">chapitre 8</A> plaide pour une poursuite du d&eacute;bat d'ici la prochaine n&eacute;gociation.  Des recherches pratiques utilisables par les d&eacute;cideurs doivent &ecirc;tre effectu&eacute;es et une strat&eacute;gie de communication convaincant l'opinion publique de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; poursuivre la coop&eacute;ration devra &ecirc;tre mise en oeuvre.

<H3>Evolution des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts dans la coop&eacute;ration commerciale UE-ACP</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171; M&ecirc;me si les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences ont subi ou continuent &agrave; subir une &eacute;rosion, des marges de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences subsisteront bien apr&egrave;s l'an 2000. Combin&eacute;es &agrave; des mesures de stimulation de la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;,  [elles peuvent] permettre &agrave; un secteur priv&eacute; ACP revitalis&eacute; de prendre pied sur le march&eacute; de l'UE &#187; (un ambassadeur ACP).</I>

<P>

Malgr&eacute; l'acc&egrave;s pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel au march&eacute; europ&eacute;en pr&eacute;vu par la Convention de Lom&eacute;, les exportations des pays ACP vers l'Europe se sont d&eacute;t&eacute;rior&eacute;es au cours des deux derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies. A l'heure actuelle, les dispositions commerciales de la Convention sont sous pression et leur valeur, ainsi que leur existence m&ecirc;me au-del&agrave; de l'an 2000, sont mises en cause. Il est commun&eacute;ment admis que le commerce contribue au d&eacute;veloppement. La question est donc de savoir comment la coop&eacute;ration commerciale peut &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute;e pour devenir un instrument de d&eacute;veloppement plus appropri&eacute; et plus apte &agrave; r&eacute;pondre aux d&eacute;fis auxquels les pays ACP seront confront&eacute;s au 21e si&egrave;cle.

<P>

Les relations commerciales entre l'Europe et de nombreux pays ACP existent depuis longtemps, certaines remontant &agrave; l'&eacute;poque coloniale. Il demeure important aujourd'hui de renforcer les relations &eacute;conomiques entre l'UE et les ACP, mais sur des bases diff&eacute;rentes. L'approvisionnement garanti en mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res &agrave; un prix stable est, sans doute, aujourd'hui une consid&eacute;ration moins importante pour l'UE, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; qu'elle peut se les procurer de fa&ccedil;on plus fiable et moins on&eacute;reuse ailleurs, et qu'elle doit tenir compte de ses propres producteurs. Cependant, les pays ACP estiment que l'UE devrait maintenir son int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; leur &eacute;gard, en tant que d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s pour ses produits et, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, pour d&eacute;velopper des sph&egrave;res d'influence.

<P>

Ce dernier argument (&agrave; savoir, que les pays ACP deviennent des bases commerciales pour l'UE) est consid&eacute;r&eacute; par certains comme &eacute;tant &eacute;galement de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des ACP. Ils invoquent le fait qu'une division accrue du monde en blocs &eacute;conomiques commerciaux rend de plus en plus pertinent pour l'UE de se lier avec ses partenaires ACP. Ainsi, les Cara&iuml;bes pourraient, selon un chercheur local, &#171; offrir &agrave; l'UE une voie d'acc&egrave;s aux march&eacute;s r&eacute;gionaux de l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re &#187;. Parall&egrave;lement, les ACP ont tout int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; ce que l'UE fasse contrepoids aux autres partenaires commerciaux majeurs dans leur r&eacute;gion. Ainsi, &#171; une strat&eacute;gie commerciale en mati&egrave;re de relations avec le Pacifique est essentielle pour contrebalancer l'expansionnisme du bloc asiatique &#187;. 

<P>

Pour de nombreux pays ACP, le volet commercial demeure la partie la plus importante de la Convention. Toutefois, reconnaissant les limites des dispositions commerciales actuelles de Lom&eacute; (fond&eacute;es principalement sur l'acc&egrave;s pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel au march&eacute;), la plupart sont en faveur de nouvelles formes de coop&eacute;ration commerciale qui soient aptes &agrave; aider les ACP &agrave; devenir plus comp&eacute;titifs sur le march&eacute; mondial.

<P>

<H3>Impact et valeur des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences et protocoles : une bataille perdue ? </H3>

<P>

<I>&#171; Le faible impact de l'acc&egrave;s privil&eacute;gi&eacute; incite &agrave; penser que les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences ont &eacute;t&eacute; inefficaces voire n&eacute;fastes, dans la mesure o&ugrave; elles ont accru la d&eacute;pendance et ent&eacute;rin&eacute; le statu quo entre le Nord et le Sud &#187; (un chercheur du Pacifique).</I>

<P>

Globalement, l'impact des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences non r&eacute;ciproques et des protocoles offerts aux pays ACP a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;cevant. Au cours des deux d&eacute;cennies d'application des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences de Lom&eacute;, la part des ACP sur le march&eacute; de l'UE a chut&eacute; de 6,7 % en 1976 &agrave; 2,8 % en 1994, alors que des pays en d&eacute;veloppement b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences moins favorables ont accru leur part de march&eacute; (voir tableau 1).

<P>

De plus, la plupart des pays ACP n'ont pas r&eacute;ussi &agrave; diversifier leurs exportations vers des produits non traditionnels et &agrave; devenir plus comp&eacute;titifs sur le march&eacute; mondial. Les observateurs concluent que les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences dont ont b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; les pays ACP n'ont pas suffi pour d&eacute;velopper leur commerce et que d'autres facteurs en ont r&eacute;duit les effets escompt&eacute;s.

<CAPTION><B>Encadr&#233; 4.1: Port&#233;e des protocoles : les estimations des parties concern&#233;es</B></CAPTION>

<TR><TD>

Les protocoles relatifs au sucre, aux bananes, au rhum et &#224; la viande bovine donnent libre acc&#232;s au march&#233; de l'UE pour un volume d&#233;termin&#233; d'exportations en provenance de certains Etats ACP traditionnellement fournisseurs. Dans le cas du sucre et des bananes, les exportations ACP b&#233;n&#233;ficient du prix relativement avantageux pr&#233;vu par la PAC (g&#233;n&#233;ralement deux &#224; trois fois plus &#233;lev&#233; que le prix mondial dans le cas du sucre). La lib&#233;ralisation du commerce compromet des avantages r&#233;sultant, &#224; la fois, de prix plus &#233;lev&#233;s et d'un acc&#232;s garanti pr&#233;vu par les protocoles ; leur existence m&#234;me est mise en cause par les pressions de l'OMC et de certains des principaux partenaires commerciaux, comme il ressort du litige bananier impliquant les &#238;les du Vent de la r&#233;gion cara&#239;be.

<P>

<LI><I>Protocole sucre.</I> Les transferts d&#233;coulant de la stabilit&#233; des prix et de l'acc&#232;s garanti au march&#233; pr&#233;vus par le protocole sucre sont substantiels. Pour l'&#238;le Maurice et la Guyana, ils s'&#233;l&#232;vent &#224; 6 % du PIB ; &#224; Fidji, ils sont estim&#233;s &#224; approximativement 4 % du PIB pour la p&#233;riode 1980-1990. L'importance de ces transferts est soulign&#233;e par le nombre consid&#233;rable de personnes d&#233;pendantes de l'industrie sucri&#232;re. A Fidji, le sucre constitue 40 % du secteur agricole et emploie directement 25 % de la population active.

<P>

<LI><I>Protocole bananes</I>. Les exportations de bananes constituaient environ 78 % des exportations agricoles des &#238;les du Vent en 1990. En 1992, elles assuraient environ 90 % des revenus &#224; l'exportation vers l'UE de Sainte-Lucie et de la Dominique, 60 % de Saint-Vincent et 20 % de la Grenade. Les parts de PIB variaient en 1988 entre 37 % pour Sainte-Lucie, 32 % pour la Dominique, 25 % pour Saint-Vincent et 4 % pour la Grenade. L'acc&#232;s privil&#233;gi&#233; et garanti au march&#233; dont b&#233;n&#233;ficient les &#238;les du Vent par rapport aux producteurs de bananes "dollars" d'Am&#233;rique latine s'av&#232;re substantiel si l'on consid&#232;re ces statistiques. En l'absence de protocole, il est fort probable qu'elles ne seraient pas en mesure d'&#234;tre comp&#233;titives sur le march&#233; de l'UE sans une am&#233;lioration majeure de la qualit&#233; et de la productivit&#233;.

<P>

<LI><I>Protocole viande bovine.</I> En moyenne, le Botswana, principal b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire du protocole relatif &#224; la viande bovine, a re&#231;u des versements annuels de 24 millions d'&#233;cus sur la p&#233;riode 1990-1994 au titre des exportations bovines vers l'UE. Ceci &#233;quivaut &#224; 20 % de l'aide au d&#233;veloppement qu'il re&#231;oit.

<P>

Certains de ces facteurs sont inh&eacute;rents aux r&eacute;gimes commerciaux. Dans les milieux d'affaires ACP, on a cit&eacute; notamment : certaines barri&egrave;res non tarifaires en vigueur sur les produits agricoles (m&ecirc;me si la Convention de Lom&eacute; octroie aux ACP des exceptions &agrave; la PAC bien plus g&eacute;n&eacute;reuses que celles dont b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient d'autres partenaires de l'UE), des r&egrave;gles d'origine relativement protectrices, et une compr&eacute;hension limit&eacute;e des dispositions et de leurs proc&eacute;dures complexes. D'autres facteurs, probablement plus significatifs, sont li&eacute;s &agrave; la capacit&eacute; d'offre des pays ACP. Dans plusieurs pays ACP, les politiques commerciales et fiscales ne favorisent pas l'expansion des exportations, et un d&eacute;ficit en infrastructures financi&egrave;res et physiques et en main d'oeuvre qualifi&eacute;e entrave le d&eacute;veloppement du commerce.

<P>

Toutefois, il y a lieu de temp&eacute;rer quelque peu cette vision pessimiste : en effet, certains pays ACP ont su tirer profit des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences.

<P>

Par exemple :

<P>

<LI>des pays comme l'&icirc;le Maurice, la Jama&iuml;que, le Kenya et le Zimbabwe ont su diversifier leur &eacute;conomie vers l'exportation de produits non traditionnels (habillement, conserves de poisson et produits horticoles, par exemple) aux marges pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielles relativement importantes compar&eacute;es aux exportations de produits de base traditionnels.

<P>

<LI>des pays tels que Fidji et Sainte-Lucie ont b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; d'un ou de plusieurs des protocoles de la Convention - rhum, viande bovine, bananes et sucre - (voir encadr&eacute; 4.1).

<P>

Si les dispositions commerciales de Lom&eacute; ne sont pas reconduites, les pays qui en ont le plus largement b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; seront le plus gravement affect&eacute;s. En ce qui concerne les autres pays ACP, l'effet b&eacute;n&eacute;fique potentiel sera supprim&eacute; et il est peu probable que les exportations se d&eacute;veloppent en l'absence de nouvelles mesures en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement du commerce. <P>

<P>

N&eacute;anmoins, la lib&eacute;ralisation internationale du commerce - telle que convenue lors du r&eacute;cent cycle de l'Uruguay - et les nouveaux r&eacute;gimes commerciaux accord&eacute;es par l'UE &agrave; certains de ses autres partenaires, en M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e et en Europe centrale et orientale notamment, sont susceptibles d'accentuer l'&eacute;rosion des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences et donc de r&eacute;duire leur effet potentiel pour les pays ACP. Aussi y a-t-il lieu de se demander s'il est encore la peine de se battre en faveur des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences alors que l'environnement commercial international est beaucoup moins favorable &agrave; leur &eacute;gard.

<P>

<H3>Incompatibilit&eacute; avec l'OMC : qu'en est-t-il vraiment ?</H3>

<P>

Mises &agrave; part des consid&eacute;rations tenant &agrave; l'impact des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences et protocoles non r&eacute;ciproques et &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de les maintenir, c'est leur acceptabilit&eacute; politique dans l'environnement international qui d&eacute;terminera leur sort. En l'&eacute;tat actuel des choses, de nombreuses clauses commerciales fondamentales de la Convention de Lom&eacute; sont incompatibles avec l'esprit des accords post-Uruguay auquel veille l'Organisation mondiale du commerce. Il est beaucoup plus difficile de justifier une d&eacute;rogation ACP au principe de la nation la plus favoris&eacute;e (NPF) que par le pass&eacute;, et ce, pour deux raisons principales :

<P>

<LI><I>Discrimination entre pays en d&eacute;veloppement</I>. Les pays ACP b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient d'un traitement plus favorable que d'autres pays &agrave; revenu comparable, ce qui emp&ecirc;che les dispositions de Lom&eacute; d'&ecirc;tre couvertes par une d&eacute;rogation &agrave; la clause de la NPF en faveur des pays en d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<LI><I>Non-r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences de Lom&eacute;</I>. L'accord commercial entre l'UE et les ACP ne peut faire l'objet d'une d&eacute;rogation au titre des accords commerciaux r&eacute;gionaux pr&eacute;vus par l'article 24 de l'OMC, car il ne comporte pas de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;.

<P>

La Convention de Lom&eacute; a obtenu une d&eacute;rogation de l'OMC pour son non-respect du principe de la NPF, mais celle-ci expirera en f&eacute;vrier 2000. La situation actuelle n'est, par cons&eacute;quent, pas satisfaisante, m&ecirc;me si cette d&eacute;rogation est prorog&eacute;e apr&egrave;s l'an 2000. Nombreux sont ceux qui estiment qu'il faut rem&eacute;dier &agrave; cette situation inacceptable et que la compatibilit&eacute; avec l'OMC est un crit&egrave;re incontournable des futurs r&eacute;gimes commerciaux entre l'UE et les ACP. D'autres sont plut&#244;t d'avis que l'OMC est avant tout un forum politique, au sein duquel l'UE et les ACP pourraient exercer conjointement une pression suffisante pour faire accepter le type de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences actuellement en vigueur par les autres partenaires commerciaux, pour autant que l'UE en ait la volont&eacute; politique.

<P>

La difficult&eacute; inh&eacute;rente &agrave; la question de la compatibilit&eacute; est qu'aucune des alternatives actuelles propos&eacute;es pour rendre Lom&eacute; plus compatible au sens de l'OMC n'est exempte de probl&egrave;mes, du fait, notamment, que les r&egrave;gles de l'OMC n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tablies dans l'esprit des accords de coop&eacute;ration Nord-Sud, en particulier de la Convention de Lom&eacute;. Il a donc &eacute;t&eacute; sugg&eacute;r&eacute; de modifier les r&egrave;gles de l'OMC en d&eacute;veloppant un nouveau type de d&eacute;rogation, parall&egrave;le &agrave; l'article 24, qui servirait de base &agrave; des accords de coop&eacute;ration commerciale Nord-Sud.

<P>

Une fa&ccedil;on de rendre Lom&eacute; plus compatible, compte tenu des r&egrave;gles en vigueur, consisterait &agrave; &eacute;tendre le groupe ACP aux pays d'un niveau de d&eacute;veloppement comparable. Ceci respecterait le principe de non-discrimination de l'OMC et r&eacute;pondrait aux critiques internes &agrave; l'UE qui s'&eacute;l&egrave;vent contre la concentration parmi les ACP d'anciennes colonies de certains Etats membres. Enfin, une autre possibilit&eacute; consisterait &agrave; introduire la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; dans le contexte d'un accord commercial de libre-&eacute;change entre l'UE et les pays ACP.

<P>

<H3>R&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; ou non-r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; ?</H3>

<P>

<I>&#171; Le syst&egrave;me des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences non r&eacute;ciproques a atteint sa limite de viabilit&eacute; ou d&eacute;pass&eacute; la &#171; date limite de vente &#187; et ne peut plus &ecirc;tre l'instrument permettant d'am&eacute;liorer les performances commerciales des ACP &#187; (un chercheur cara&iuml;be repr&eacute;sentant les milieux d'affaires).</I>

<P>

Au-del&agrave; de la compatibilit&eacute; avec l'OMC, la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; pourrait s'av&eacute;rer b&eacute;n&eacute;fique pour les ACP en leur procurant les avantages &eacute;conomiques li&eacute;s &agrave; la lib&eacute;ralisation. D'autres voix s'&eacute;l&egrave;vent pour dire que la relation entre r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; et OMC n'est pas aussi simple. Les partisans de ce point de vue estiment que les gains en efficacit&eacute; vont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement de pair avec une lib&eacute;ralisation &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de tous les partenaires commerciaux et non avec une ouverture partielle &agrave; un partenaire donn&eacute;. En outre, il existe un risque r&eacute;el que la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; n'obtienne pas gain de cause aux termes de l'article 24 de l'OMC sur les zones de libre-&eacute;change, car elle n'engloberait pas une part suffisante du commerce entre les partenaires.

<P>

Les repr&eacute;sentants de l'UE sont en faveur de la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; - elle ne pr&eacute;sente pas de grands risques pour eux - qu'ils associent au concept d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t mutuel entre l'UE et les ACP. En revanche, les ACP se demandent en quoi l'ouverture de leur march&eacute; aux exportateurs europ&eacute;ens leur procurerait un avantage, alors qu'aux termes des arrangements actuels ils ont un acc&egrave;s pratiquement total au march&eacute; de l'UE (voir encadr&eacute; 4.2). Un &eacute;l&eacute;ment de r&eacute;ponse serait que les gains et pertes varient d'un pays &agrave; l'autre et que les d&eacute;cisions &agrave; prendre requi&egrave;rent donc une approche au cas par cas.

<P>

La r&eacute;gion la mieux pr&eacute;par&eacute;e &agrave; une transformation des dispositions commerciales actuelles en accord r&eacute;gional avec l'UE bas&eacute; sur un certain degr&eacute; de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; est celle des Cara&iuml;bes. Selon des repr&eacute;sentants de cette r&eacute;gion, ceci aurait les effets b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques suivants : une s&eacute;curit&eacute; et une transparence accrues favorisant le commerce et les investissements ; des opportunit&eacute;s pour n&eacute;gocier un acc&egrave;s suppl&eacute;mentaire pour des produits agricoles et compenser dans une certaine mesure les pertes des autres pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences ; et, enfin, la possibilit&eacute; d'une assistance en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement du commerce et des investissements - y compris des incitations sp&eacute;ciales en faveur de <I>

joint-ventures</I> entre des entreprises europ&eacute;ennes et cara&iuml;bes. Par contre, la plupart des repr&eacute;sentants africains craignent que leurs industries locales ne survivent pas &agrave; la concurrence des exportations europ&eacute;ennes sur leurs march&eacute;s. Ils redoutent l'&eacute;croulement de leurs industries manufacturi&egrave;res d&eacute;j&agrave; fragiles, ce qui entra&icirc;nerait une augmentation du ch&#244;mage et d'&eacute;ventuels troubles sociaux.

<H3>Conditions pour une transition en douceur pour les ACP vers la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;</H3>

<P>

Tout le monde s'accorde &agrave; dire que l'UE doit pourvoir &agrave; une transition en douceur pour les ACP vers la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;, au cas o&ugrave; celle-ci serait introduite. Les ACP ont sugg&eacute;r&eacute; un certain nombre de conditions pour une transition sans secousses. 

<P>

Les nouvelles modalit&eacute;s commerciales devront se mettre en place de fa&ccedil;on asym&eacute;trique dans le temps et probablement dans la couverture des produits ; elles devront inclure le droit des pays ACP &agrave; prot&eacute;ger certains secteurs et produits, et pr&eacute;voir une p&eacute;riode d'ajustement. Cette asym&eacute;trie pourrait varier d'un pays ou d'une r&eacute;gion &agrave; l'autre, en fonction de leurs niveaux respectifs de d&eacute;veloppement, revenu, d&eacute;veloppement humain, endettement, degr&eacute; de comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;, vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;rosion des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences, et d&eacute;pendance des exportations sur le march&eacute; de l'UE.

<P>

Ces crit&egrave;res sugg&egrave;rent une approche diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e entre les pays ACP, &agrave; la fois entre les r&eacute;gions et &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de celles-ci. En termes de revenus, le chapitre pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent a d&eacute;j&agrave; mis en &eacute;vidence que les disparit&eacute;s au sein du groupe ACP et entre celui-ci et d'autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement sont trop importantes pour &ecirc;tre ignor&eacute;es. Les contraintes auxquelles les r&eacute;gions et les pays doivent faire face en d&eacute;veloppant leur commerce diff&egrave;rent &eacute;galement.

<P>

Une approche diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e s'impose. Ainsi, des diff&eacute;rences consid&eacute;rables existent dans le degr&eacute; de d&eacute;pendance des pays ACP &agrave; l'&eacute;gard du march&eacute; europ&eacute;en pour les revenus &agrave; l'exportation. Les changements propos&eacute;s au niveau international peuvent &ecirc;tre d&eacute;sastreux s'ils ne tiennent pas compte de ces diff&eacute;rences et surtout de la fragilit&eacute; de certains pays. Ainsi la d&eacute;pendance moyenne &agrave; l'&eacute;gard du march&eacute; europ&eacute;en est de 46 % pour les pays d'Afrique, de 18 % aux Cara&iuml;bes, et de 23 % dans le Pacifique. De grandes disparit&eacute;s existent aussi au sein des r&eacute;gions. Aux Cara&iuml;bes, le degr&eacute; de d&eacute;pendance est de 70 % pour Sainte-Lucie et de 60 % pour Saint-Vincent. Dans le Pacifique, le Vanuatu d&eacute;pend du march&eacute; europ&eacute;en pour 53 % de ses revenus &agrave; l'exportation, alors qu'en Afrique, la Guin&eacute;e &eacute;quatoriale, la R&eacute;publique centrafricaine, l'&icirc;le Maurice, le Niger et l'Ouganda d&eacute;passent tous les 75 %.

<P>

<H3>Options pour une relance de la coop&eacute;ration commerciale </H3>

<P>

<I>&#171; La protection artificielle du commerce [en faveur des pays ACP] ne pourra &ecirc;tre maintenue ind&eacute;finiment &#187; (un repr&eacute;sentant de l'UE).</I>

<P>

<H4>Des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences de Lom&eacute; non r&eacute;ciproques pour les pays ACP</H4>

<P>

Cette option qui peut &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme le maintien du statu quo pr&eacute;sente l'avantage de conserver les acquis de Lom&eacute; et les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences. En vue de compenser l'&eacute;rosion des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences qui d&eacute;coule d'une ouverture accrue du march&eacute; europ&eacute;en &agrave; d'autres partenaires commerciaux de l'UE, il y aurait lieu d'examiner la marge disponible pour des concessions suppl&eacute;mentaires et l'assouplissement des r&egrave;gles d'origine. Cependant, compte tenu des difficult&eacute;s rencontr&eacute;es pendant la r&eacute;vision &agrave; mi-parcours de Lom&eacute; IV, on peut s'attendre &agrave; des difficult&eacute;s. Consid&eacute;rant l'impact relativement modeste des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, une attention plus grande devrait &ecirc;tre accord&eacute;e &agrave; d'autres facteurs influant sur les performances commerciales (voir l'encadr&eacute; 4.3 contenant quelques suggestions). Dans la mesure o&ugrave; l'accord demeure limit&eacute; aux pays ACP, il continue &agrave; &ecirc;tre discriminatoire et incompatible avec les r&egrave;gles de l'OMC. N&eacute;anmoins, les ACP ont la possibilit&eacute; jusqu'&agrave; l'an 2000 d'exploiter au maximum les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences existantes et de tester de nouvelles strat&eacute;gies en vue de renforcer leur comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;.

<P>

<H4>Des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences non r&eacute;ciproques pour l'ensemble des pays en d&eacute;veloppement</H4>

<P>

Dans ce sc&eacute;nario, les pays les moins avanc&eacute;s seraient int&eacute;gr&eacute;s dans un accord de type Lom&eacute;, alors que les pays ACP d'un niveau de d&eacute;veloppement plus &eacute;lev&eacute; seraient couverts par le syst&egrave;me de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;es (SPG) ; une autre possibilit&eacute; serait l'int&eacute;gration des pays ACP dans une politique commerciale g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et graduelle couvrant l'ensemble des pays en d&eacute;veloppement par le biais d'un SPG r&eacute;nov&eacute;.

<CAPTION><B>Encadr&#233; 4.3 : Mesures pour soutenir le d&#233;veloppement du commerce</B></CAPTION>

<TR><TD>

<P>

Quel que soit le sc&#233;nario consid&#233;r&#233;, l'UE et les ACP devraient s'efforcer de faire en sorte que les dispositions relatives &#224; l'acc&#232;s des exportateurs ACP au march&#233; europ&#233;en soient mieux utilis&#233;es. Etant donn&#233; que la position privil&#233;gi&#233;e des ACP par rapport &#224; d'autres exportateurs s'affaiblira au cours des ann&#233;es &#224; venir (vu l'improbabilit&#233; de nouvelles pr&#233;f&#233;rences), il est clair que les pays ACP devront se pr&#233;parer &#224; une concurrence plus s&#233;v&#232;re dans l'environnement commercial international. Voici quelques suggestions pour aider les pays ACP dans cette voie :

<P><UL>

<LI>Mise en oeuvre d'instruments novateurs de financement des exportations et de m&#233;canismes de garantie afin d'all&#233;ger les contraintes pesant sur les exportateurs et les producteurs ;

<P>

<LI>Assistance en mati&#232;re de recherche, de formation et d'aide technique en vue d'accro&#238;tre la productivit&#233;,  l'efficacit&#233; et la diversification dans les pays ACP ;

<P>

<LI>Poursuite de l'assistance en mati&#232;re d'infrastructures au plan national et r&#233;gional ;

<P>

<LI>Acheminement de l'information et du financement directement vers les organisations commerciales qui utilisent les dispositions ;

<P>

<LI>Renforcement des capacit&#233;s des ACP afin qu'ils deviennent des acteurs plus significatifs dans les n&#233;gociations relatives au commerce international ;

<P>

<LI>Assistance aux pays ACP dans l'adoption de nouvelles normes commerciales. 

</UL>

</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

Dans tous les cas de figure, les pays ACP partageraient leur position privil&eacute;gi&eacute;e sur le march&eacute; europ&eacute;en avec d'autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement (le Bangladesh, par exemple) et devraient faire face &agrave; une concurrence plus vaste. Certains des pays ACP se verraient confront&eacute;s &agrave; une r&eacute;duction de leur acc&egrave;s au march&eacute; europ&eacute;en. L'avantage serait l'acceptabilit&eacute; aux yeux de l'OMC. Enfin, en tant que traitement non r&eacute;ciproque, il ne serait pas &agrave; craindre que la concurrence des exportateurs europ&eacute;ens augmente sur les march&eacute;s des pays ACP.

<P>

<H4>Des accords de libre-&eacute;change asym&eacute;triques bas&eacute;s sur la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;</H4>

<P>

Un tel accord obligerait les pays ACP &agrave; ouvrir progressivement leurs march&eacute;s aux exportateurs de l'UE. L'une des options consisterait &agrave; &eacute;tablir une ZLE entre l'UE et l'ensemble des pays ACP. Cependant, cela pourrait n'&ecirc;tre ni r&eacute;alisable ni souhaitable dans la mesure o&ugrave; cela implique que tous les pays ACP ouvrent aussi leurs fronti&egrave;res les uns aux autres (si l'on prend la d&eacute;finition donn&eacute;e par l'OMC d'une ZLE).

<P>

Une variante plus vraisemblable de cette option consiste &agrave; &eacute;tablir des accords r&eacute;gionaux entre l'UE et des sous-espaces du groupe des ACP. Ceci va dans le sens actuel des accords de r&eacute;gion &agrave; r&eacute;gion que l'UE s'efforce de promouvoir. L'acc&egrave;s au march&eacute; europ&eacute;en demeurerait le m&ecirc;me qu'actuellement, c'est &agrave; dire plus avantageux que celui d'autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement, mais, en &eacute;change, les ACP offriraient des avantages r&eacute;ciproques &agrave; l'UE. Ce type d'accord est plus susceptible d'obtenir l'approbation de l'OMC, surtout s'il couvre &#171; pratiquement l'ensemble du commerce &#187; (condition dont le contenu exact n'a pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; clairement d&eacute;fini) et si la transition vers le libre-&eacute;change ne dure pas plus de 10-12 ans. Le maintien d'une protection pour certains secteurs et industries au-del&agrave; de la p&eacute;riode de transition, comme certains ont sugg&eacute;r&eacute;, n'est pas autoris&eacute; selon les r&egrave;glements actuels de l'OMC en mati&egrave;re de ZLE.

<P>

Dans ce cas de figure, les producteurs ACP devraient affronter une concurrence plus forte des marchandises europ&eacute;ennes sur leurs march&eacute;s, ce qui profiterait aux producteurs europ&eacute;ens et rendrait l'accord plus facile &agrave; d&eacute;fendre dans l'UE.

<P>

<H4>Une Convention-cadre &agrave; g&eacute;om&eacute;trie variable</H4>

<P>

Une telle configuration combinerait des accords r&eacute;ciproques et non r&eacute;ciproques r&eacute;gis par un accord global maintenant le cadre de Lom&eacute; et assorti d'une structure qui permette &agrave; certaines r&eacute;gions (ou pays) ACP d'aller, volontairement, de l'avant sur la voie d'accords commerciaux avec l'UE pr&eacute;voyant des concessions mutuelles qui pourraient inclure la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;. On introduirait ainsi une dimension &#171; &agrave; la carte &#187; dans la relation commerciale.

<P>

Aux termes de l'accord-cadre, l'ensemble des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieraient d'une assistance et d'un acc&egrave;s g&eacute;n&eacute;raux. Un appui compl&eacute;mentaire cibl&eacute; et de nouvelles dispositions seraient mis en oeuvre en fonction des besoins de sous-groupes particuliers. Par exemple, les pays moins avanc&eacute;s pourraient avoir besoin d'une assistance suppl&eacute;mentaire pour am&eacute;liorer leur capacit&eacute; d'offre, alors que des pays plus comp&eacute;titifs b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieraient d'un acc&egrave;s plus facile aux services et aux investissements.

<P>

Dans ce cas, comme dans celui de l'option pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente concernant une ZLE r&eacute;gionale, un accord-cadre dans la ligne de la Convention de Lom&eacute; pourrait &ecirc;tre maintenu, en pr&eacute;servant le groupe ACP. L'UE pourrait aussi n&eacute;gocier individuellement avec chaque r&eacute;gion. Cela entra&icirc;nerait in&eacute;vitablement une rupture de la solidarit&eacute; des ACP et une diminution du poids politique du groupe ACP dans les n&eacute;gociations, mais pourrait permettre de mieux cibler les besoins au niveau r&eacute;gional sans avoir &agrave; trouver des compromis pour accommoder les demandes d'autres r&eacute;gions (tels que des concessions pour des produits particuliers ou l'assouplissement de certaines r&egrave;gles d'origine).

<P>

<H3>Quel avenir ?</H3>

<P>

La question fondamentale reste de savoir si l'une de ces options faciliterait et encouragerait l'int&eacute;gration des ACP dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale comme le pr&eacute;conise le trait&eacute; de Maastricht &agrave; l'article 130 U. Bien que l'on s'accorde &agrave; trouver n&eacute;cessaire une certaine adaptation des dispositions actuelles de la Convention de Lom&eacute; afin de prendre en compte les besoins sp&eacute;cifiques des pays ACP dans un environnement de plus en plus concurrentiel, cette adaptation ne suffira peut-&ecirc;tre pas pour r&eacute;actualiser la coop&eacute;ration commerciale entre l'UE et les ACP.

<P>

L'&eacute;laboration d'un nouveau mod&egrave;le de coop&eacute;ration Nord-Sud, qui prendrait en compte les difficult&eacute;s des pays les moins avanc&eacute;s, risque de remettre en question des principes que l'on consid&egrave;re comme &#171; acquis &#187; dans le contexte actuel du commerce international.

<P>

Ainsi, la mondialisation joue un r&#244;le majeur dans les pourparlers commerciaux actuels. Le pr&eacute;sident du sous-comit&eacute; des ambassadeurs ACP, charg&eacute; du dossier post-Lom&eacute; IV, tout comme certaines ONG europ&eacute;ennes, trouve que la mondialisation est en conflit avec les besoins du d&eacute;veloppement (voir annexe 1). Ils pr&eacute;f&egrave;reraient que l'UE contribue &agrave; l'&eacute;mergence d'un dispositif de r&egrave;gles commerciales qui stimuleraient un &#171; commerce &eacute;quitable &#187; v&eacute;hiculant non seulement la croissance mais aussi le d&eacute;veloppement. Tout ceci implique un r&eacute;examen de la politique commerciale europ&eacute;enne au plan mondial, et pr&eacute;suppose une volont&eacute; politique suffisante pour influencer dans ce sens les discussions dans le cadre de l'OMC.

<P>

L'encadr&eacute; 4.4 reprend certains des crit&egrave;res &agrave; prendre en consid&eacute;ration pour &eacute;valuer la faisabilit&eacute; des nouvelles dispositions r&eacute;gissant les relations commerciales entre l'UE et les pays ACP.

<P>

Etant donn&eacute; le large &eacute;ventail des vues entre les acteurs ACP et europ&eacute;ens concern&eacute;s par ces discussions, aucun effort de classification par importance n'a &eacute;t&eacute; fait. Il faudra &eacute;tudier de fa&ccedil;on plus approfondie les quatre options esquiss&eacute;es ci-dessus, &eacute;valuer leurs cons&eacute;quences de fa&ccedil;on g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et pays par pays, et affiner les crit&egrave;res de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; ce qu'ils soient acceptables &agrave; la fois pour l'UE et pour les ACP. Trois th&egrave;mes devront &ecirc;tre examin&eacute;s en profondeur :

<P>

<LI>Les cons&eacute;quences pratiques et &eacute;conomiques de ces options pour les &eacute;conomies des ACP et de l'UE.

<P>

<LI>Les instruments et les mesures interm&eacute;diaires susceptibles d'&ecirc;tre introduits pour soutenir le d&eacute;veloppement du commerce et permettre une transition en douceur vers un nouveau traitement commercial.

R&#233;f&#233;rences bibliographiques: ECDPM. 1996. <i>Au-del&agrave; de Lom&eacute; IV - 

Pistes de r&eacute;flexion sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE</i>. (Rapport No. 6). Maastricht: Centre Europ&#233;en de Gestion des Politiques de D&#233;veloppement.

<HR>

<P>

<I>&#171;Le d&eacute;bat &#171;Au-del&agrave; de Lom&eacute; IV&#187; nous invite en fait &agrave; repenser de mani&egrave;re fondamentale la nature de notre coop&eacute;ration et les moyens de la formuler et de la mettre en oeuvre&#187; (un responsable de l'UE).</I>

<P>

Le processus de r&eacute;vision de Lom&eacute; ne fait que commencer. L'actuelle Convention arrive &agrave; son terme le 29 f&eacute;vrier 2000. Dix-huit mois avant que Lom&eacute; IV n'expire (c'est-&agrave;-dire le 1er septembre 1998), des n&eacute;gociations seront officiellement entam&eacute;es en vue &#171;d'examiner les dispositions qui r&eacute;giront ult&eacute;rieurement les relations entre la Communaut&eacute; et les Etats membres, d'une part, et les Etats ACP, d'autre part&#187; (article 366, 3 de la Convention).

<P>

Cela signifie qu'il reste moins de deux ans pour se pr&eacute;parer convenablement &agrave; ces n&eacute;gociations. Ce d&eacute;lai est relativement court si l'on tient compte du &#171;d&eacute;ficit d'information&#187; en ce qui concerne Lom&eacute;, de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de tenir d'importantes consultations et de mener le dialogue &agrave; diff&eacute;rents niveaux, ainsi que de la complexit&eacute; de reconcevoir un accord de coop&eacute;ration vieux de vingt ans.

<P>

Avec son programme &#171;Au-del&agrave; de Lom&eacute; IV&#187;, l'ECDPM a cherch&eacute; &agrave; combler ce d&eacute;ficit d'information et &agrave; stimuler de nouvelles r&eacute;flexions, en particulier dans les pays ACP. Avec ce rapport, il esp&egrave;re contribuer &agrave; une meilleure compr&eacute;hension des questions en jeu dans le processus de r&eacute;vision de Lom&eacute;, en tenant compte des craintes et des attentes des diff&eacute;rentes parties prenantes et des options de r&eacute;forme possibles.

<P>

Dans ce dernier chapitre, nous fournirons quelques indices &agrave; l'intention de ceux qui souhaitent influencer ce d&eacute;bat, &agrave; l'&eacute;volution rapide, sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE.

<P>

<H3>Une information ad&eacute;quate</H3>

<P>

Comme nous l'avons &eacute;voqu&eacute; pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment, les repr&eacute;sentants ACP de diff&eacute;rents horizons sont tr&egrave;s sceptiques, voire pessimistes, en ce qui concerne les chances d'un d&eacute;bat &eacute;quitable. Ils craignent que &#171;l'Europe n'ait d&eacute;j&agrave; pris sa d&eacute;cision&#187; quant aux ACP et que la consultation et le dialogue n'y changent rien.

<P>

Le climat politique actuel en Europe nourrit peut-&ecirc;tre de telles opinions. Pourtant, nous avons la ferme conviction qu'une bonne information peut influencer le d&eacute;bat. On pourrait nettement progresser si les gouvernements ACP s'associaient au d&eacute;bat avec une autre tournure d'esprit que par le pass&eacute;, s'ils ne se bornaient pas &agrave; &#171;continuer comme d'habitude&#187; et &agrave; d&eacute;fendre simplement les acquis. Cette attitude impliquerait l'acceptation d'un type de partenariat diff&eacute;rent, fond&eacute; sur les meilleurs &eacute;l&eacute;ments de la &#171;culture de Lom&eacute;&#187; (responsabilit&eacute; des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, dialogue et pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute;) tout en int&eacute;grant un nouvel ensemble de principes de base refl&eacute;tant les priorit&eacute;s et les pr&eacute;occupations de l'UE (allocation de l'aide li&eacute;e &agrave; la performance, responsabilisation, transparence, pluralisme institutionnel).

<P>

Les secteurs priv&eacute;s des ACP ont beaucoup &agrave; gagner &agrave; participer activement au d&eacute;bat. Ils sont bien plac&eacute;s pour faire des propositions de coop&eacute;ration future r&eacute;pondant mieux &agrave; leurs besoins, y compris des propositions d'instruments nouveaux. Les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile pourraient &eacute;galement faire une br&egrave;che si elles parvenaient &agrave; mobiliser leurs partisans et &agrave; unir leurs forces pour se d&eacute;fendre. Dans le trait&eacute; de Maastricht, l'UE s'est juridiquement engag&eacute;e &agrave; lutter contre la pauvret&eacute;, &agrave; favoriser le d&eacute;veloppement durable et &agrave; assurer l'int&eacute;gration des pays en d&eacute;veloppement dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale. Ces dispositions l&eacute;gales offrent un &#171;point d'acc&egrave;s&#187; parfait pour un plaidoyer s&eacute;rieux en faveur des pays en d&eacute;veloppement actuellement associ&eacute;s &agrave; la Convention de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

<H3>Des preuves tangibles et des recherches solides </H3>

<P>

Ce n'est pas le moment &#171;d'&eacute;laborer des politiques sans passer &agrave; l'action&#187;. Les exhortations &agrave; la solidarit&eacute; internationale ou les sc&eacute;narios catastrophes ne suffiront pas; le meilleur moyen de convaincre l'opinion publique et les politiciens europ&eacute;ens est de pr&eacute;senter des propositions politiques fond&eacute;es sur des preuves tangibles et des r&eacute;sultats de recherche solides. Du point de vue de son contenu, l'ordre du jour est tr&egrave;s vaste. Par exemple, il faut absolument &eacute;valuer la performance pass&eacute;e des diff&eacute;rents instruments de Lom&eacute; et dresser des &#171;bilans&#187; indiquant l'impact du FED sur le d&eacute;veloppement ACP (notamment, par le biais d'&eacute;tudes de cas par pays). Il faut, en outre, effectuer des recherches sur les cons&eacute;quences de la lib&eacute;ralisation des &eacute;changes pour les &eacute;conomies et le d&eacute;veloppement social des ACP; il faut &eacute;galement r&eacute;aliser une analyse approfondie des gains et des avantages potentiels d'une r&eacute;gionalisation de Lom&eacute; et de la scission du groupe ACP qui en d&eacute;coulerait. Des recherches s'imposent &eacute;galement pour concevoir de nouveaux m&eacute;canismes de d&eacute;centralisation de l'attribution de l'aide (modalit&eacute;s de financement direct). Mais, par dessus tout, les acteurs ACP doivent &eacute;laborer leurs propres id&eacute;es sur la coop&eacute;ration future, plut&#244;t que de se contenter de r&eacute;agir aux propositions europ&eacute;ennes. D'un point de vue organisationnel, cette d&eacute;marche n&eacute;cessite la mobilisation des capacit&eacute;s de recherche des ACP et l'association des r&eacute;sultats de ces recherches au processus d'&eacute;laboration des politiques.

<P>

<H3>Une red&eacute;finition de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE</H3>

<P>

Les diff&eacute;rentes parties int&eacute;ress&eacute;es doivent bien se rendre compte que cette reconsid&eacute;ration de Lom&eacute; s'inscrit dans une r&eacute;vision beaucoup plus vaste de toute la politique de d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE. Le trait&eacute; de Maastricht apporte &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement une fondation l&eacute;gale dans la construction europ&eacute;enne. Il d&eacute;finit des objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement clairs et exige une meilleure coordination, davantage de compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; (entre les efforts des Etats membres et de la Commission) et une coh&eacute;rence politique accrue.

<P>

Il reste encore beaucoup de travail &agrave; faire au niveau europ&eacute;en pour comprendre les implications de ces objectifs pour la pratique au quotidien. Il sera important de rester au courant des changements politiques &agrave; cet &eacute;gard puisqu'ils auront peut-&ecirc;tre des cons&eacute;quences sur la sc&egrave;ne de la future coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE et sur ses modalit&eacute;s.

<P>

Il est &eacute;galement n&eacute;cessaire de surveiller l'&eacute;volution de la politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'UE, en particulier par rapport &agrave; la conf&eacute;rence intergouvernementale (qui proc&egrave;de actuellement &agrave; la r&eacute;vision du trait&eacute; de Maastricht) et &agrave; l'&eacute;largissement envisag&eacute; de l'Union (qui aura probablement d'importantes r&eacute;percussions sur la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE). Les pays de Lom&eacute; auraient &eacute;galement int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; analyser en d&eacute;tail la mani&egrave;re dont l'UE a conclu des accords de coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres r&eacute;gions (Asie, Am&eacute;rique latine et Europe de l'Est). Ces accords ont &eacute;tabli des types diff&eacute;rents de partenariats, de proc&eacute;dures d&eacute;cisionnelles et de m&eacute;canismes financiers. C'est ainsi que Lom&eacute; est la derni&egrave;re Convention, dans les relations ext&eacute;rieures de l'UE, &agrave; comporter un engagement &#171;contractuel&#187; sous la forme d'un protocole financier allant jusqu'&agrave; l'an 2000. Cela porte &agrave; penser que Lom&eacute; sera &eacute;galement &#171;d&eacute;contractualis&eacute;&#187;.

<P>

<H3>Le r&#244;le des Etats membres</H3>

<P>

La Commission (DG VIII) montre une v&eacute;ritable volont&eacute; de discuter ouvertement l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE, sans tabous et dans un esprit de participation. Mais qu'en est-il des Etats membres? Leurs opinions et leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts divergent en ce qui concerne l'avenir de Lom&eacute;. En outre, ce n'est pas seulement le renouvellement de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement avec les Etats ACP qui est en jeu, mais aussi l'&eacute;quilibre du pouvoir entre les organismes d'aide nationaux et la Commission. La compatibilit&eacute; entre les pr&eacute;occupations de d&eacute;veloppement et les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du commerce, de l'industrie et de l'agriculture est aussi sur la balance. Tout ceci montre la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'assurer une communication efficace et un dialogue s&eacute;rieux avec les Etats membres. Il est d'une importance cruciale, en particulier pour les instances ACP et les ONG europ&eacute;ennes, de se tenir au courant des opinions des diff&eacute;rents Etats membres et de veiller &agrave; ce qu'ils participent de fa&ccedil;on constructive &agrave; la r&eacute;vision de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

<H3>Une pr&eacute;sentation convaincante du message</H3>

<P>

Enfin, nous sugg&eacute;rons d'adopter une strat&eacute;gie de communication moderne. Les acteurs ACP, en particulier, feraient bien d'&eacute;laborer une strat&eacute;gie de marketing pour mettre en &eacute;vidence leurs craintes, leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et leurs attentes. S'ils veulent conclure un meilleur accord avec l'UE, il devrontfaire preuve de persuasion pour convaincre les Europ&eacute;ens et leurs gouvernements que la coop&eacute;ration avec les pays de Lom&eacute; est un bon investissement. Les acteurs ACP devront d&eacute;montrer que la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement demeure un appui vital pour leurs propres efforts; ils devront expliquer ce qui pourrait leur arriver (ainsi qu'&agrave; l'UE) si ce type de coop&eacute;ration &eacute;tait r&eacute;duit, supprim&eacute; ou modifi&eacute;; il leur faudra montrer comment cette coop&eacute;ration peut servir les buts et les objectifs de l'UE elle-m&ecirc;me et, enfin, offrir des garanties que l'argent du contribuable peut &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute; convenablement.

<P>

La balle est donc essentiellement dans le camp des pays ACP. S'ils arrivent &agrave; transmettre un message fort et convaincant, les chances de r&eacute;ponse positive de la part de l'UE augmenteront grandement. Ainsi s'ouvriraient de nouvelles perspectives de relations de partenariat avantageuses pour les diff&eacute;rentes parties et adapt&eacute;es aux d&eacute;fis que pose le d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; l'approche du 21 si&egrave;cle.

<h3>LESOTHO: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CALLS ON GOVERNMENT AND 
SECURITY FORCES TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS</h3>

On the first anniversary of the restoration of civilian government in Lesotho -- and in the lead up to the long- awaited "national dialogue" on 17 September -- Amnesty International is appealing to the government and the security forces to cooperate in ensuring full respect for human rights in the country.
<p>
"The continuing tensions between the civilian government and the armed forces has left the country's citizens vulnerable to human rights violations and without effective means of redress, " Amnesty International said today. "Unless the perpetrators of these violations are held accountable for their actions, violations will continue." 
<p>
Serious human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions, sometimes in secret places, allegations of ill-treatment and torture, and deaths in custody as well as deaths resulting from the use of unjustified, lethal force by the security forces have taken place during the past year apparently without government suction. The perpetrators have not been brought to justice. Among the victims have been government officials, a senior security police officer, members of parliament, alleged former members of the Lesotho Liberation Army, trade unionists, campaigners for human rights, and ordinary citizens.
<p>
Despite last year's intervention by the Presidents of Zimababwe, South Africa and Botswana -- which helped restore the overthrown government of Ntsu Mokhele -- unresolved political tensions and a situation of fear and suspicion continue to undermine the rule of law, according to Amnesty International, whose delegates visited the country in June this year. While the human rights organization takes no position on the political differences which may underlie these ongoing tensions, it is gravely concerned by their consequences for human rights.
<p>
In letters to government ministers and to senior officers of the National Security Service and the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police, Amnesty International has expressed concern about these violations, as well as the absence of effective investigations and any justice for the victims. 
<p>
The human rights organization is calling on the responsible authorities to take urgent steps to ensure, in accordance with the country's treaty obligations, that: 
<p>
<ul><li>the security forces are made fully accountable for their treatment of persons taken into custody and for their use of force and firearms;
<li>that violations are swiftly investigated under the supervision of independent judicial officers; 
<li>that the perpetrators are brought to justice and the victims compensated;
<li>that provisions in the Constitution and national law be amended to increase protection for the right to life and of the rights of detainees;
<li>that the Office of the Ombudsman be fully empowered to investigate violations;
<li>that Lesotho ratify or accede to international human rights treaties which would strengthen the country's existing commitments;
and
<li>that the death penalty be abolished as an affirmation of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. 
</ul><p>
Amnesty International is calling on regional and other international bodies to support Lesotho's efforts to eradicate human rights violations.
