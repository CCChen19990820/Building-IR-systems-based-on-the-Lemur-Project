<title>Newsflash 1995 - Nine Ogoni Activists Hanged in Nigeria</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<h2>World sadness as Saro-Wiwa and eight colleagues<br> hanged in Nigeria</h2></center>
<p>

World outrage tinged with despair greeted the news on Friday that Nigeria's best-known human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his colleagues had been hanged.<p>

Saro-Wiwa, who was a successful writer and businessman, was leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni peoples, which had campaigned against the pollution and exploitation of their land by multinational oil companies - including the British company Shell.  <p>

The nine campaigners were executed in Port Harcourt prison without having seen their families.  Their corpses were buried four hours later in the city cemetery.  Eye-witnesses spoke of people weeping by the roadside as the bodies were carried out of the prison.<p>

The executions, which were the swiftest in Nigeria's history, left heads of government at the Commonwealth meeting in Auckland stunned and appalled.  For those who had advocated 'persuasive diplomacy' towards the Nigerians, including Nelson Mandela and Britain's John Major, it was a severe setback.<p>

There was fierce condemnation of the Nigerian military government, led by General Sani Abacha, which sentenced the Ogoni leaders to death in a trial which was criticised by legal associations and Amnesty International as deeply flawed.<p>

Leaders at the Commonwealth summit in Auckland, angered at General Abacha's disregard of their pleas for clemency, agreed to suspend Nigeria immediately from the Commonwealth.  The country now has two years to embrace democracy or face permanent exclusion.<p>

World leaders were less eager to take measures which may harm their own interests.  Oil is widely acknowledged to be the lifeline of Nigeria's military dictators, who share the profits with large oil multinationals.  <p>

The United States buys half Nigeria's oil, but has ruled out an embargo.  Britain has backed the decision, claiming that a boycott would hurt ordinary Nigerians more than the military government.<p>

Shell, the Anglo-Dutch transnational oil company which sparked off the protests in Ogoniland with the environmental devastation brought on by its drilling activities, came under fierce criticism.  The company had planned to announce an agreement for a new $4 billion natural gas plant in Nigeria.  But today it announced that the decision was delayed for "a number of factors".<p>

In Ogoniland itself, independent reports claim that state repression is continuing.  More troops were sent to the area after the hangings, and soldiers at roadblocks are reported to be harassing and beating civilians.<p>

</center></h5>

<hr>



Information and its management are moving towards the centre of development thinking and

development action. Nowhere is this more true than in the environmental sector. Here, policy-makers,

planners, managers, and activists are calling for greater investment in the generation of data and

information, and in its subsequent use. Information is being used to report on the state of the

environment, to monitor threats to natural and human environments, to set conservation priorities, to

select among competing uses of natural resources, in the development of reliable þindicatorsþ, and

to determine levels of "sustainable" natural resource use. Information and data are also needed to

support effective policy-making and policy management.

<p>

The needs for data and information are especially pressing in small states where human and natural

resources are very limited. By focusing on ways to promote the use of information resources, as a

"niche" so to speak, small states can broaden the scope of their actions and address issues previously

beyond their capacity.

<p>

Yet, despite a multitude of reports and meetings on the need for more and better information, and long

experience in its generation and management, little is known about the contribution of information to

the policy process and how it can be strengthened. Nor is it clear how information resources and

capacities are best organised to ensure that information is used effectively in policy decisions.

<p>

In early 1995, ECDPM consulted its partners and other organisations on ways to deal with these

questions. As a first step, ECDPM organised a meeting in which environmental managers and

information specialists considered first, the use of information in environmental policy-making, and

second, approaches to information capacity-building, with special reference to the environment and

the Caribbean. A third aim, to agree on the aims and activities of a future programme of work was

also discussed.

<p>

Drawing heavily on discussions during the meeting, as well as some other sources, the report opens

by illustrating the growing concern of international and national agencies that information and data

should be used more effectively in decision-making on environmental issues. Then, based on

discussions at the meeting, the two main issues are each reviewed.

<p>

On the use of information in policy-making, participants concluded that policy-making is not a single

process, but several processes involving a wide range of actors; that the various participants in these

processes require some "knowledge capacity" to take effective decisions; that this capacity is still quite

limited and that information providers should concentrate on issues of information quality, content,

and presentation. A "distillation" function closely linked to the policy-makers was suggested as a way

to bring knowledge into policy-making processes.

<p>

On the kinds of information capacities needed in policy-making, three main clusters are identified.

First, organisations need capacities to manage the "capacity" agenda itself. Second, they need

capacities to define a vision and purpose for information activities. Third, they need capacities to

manage information flows between information providers and policy-makers. Clear þvisionsþ on the

information function are particularly crucial in empowering organisations and countries to say þnoþ

to inappropriate assistance and equipment.

<p>

Finally, five main follow-up activities are suggested: To carry out case studies of specific policy

processes; to look at the role of information in policy management situations; to þmapþ environmental

information systems and capacities; to assess the impact of specific information initiatives on policy-

making; and to raise awareness of the role of information in policy-making.

<h5>OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE BRIEFING PAPER APRIL 1994</h5>
<h3>ECONOMIC POLICIES IN THE NEW SOUTH AFRICA </h3>
<i>South Africa's first non-racial election has stimulated extensive debate about how to address the country's contemporary social and economic problems. This Briefing Paper summarises the major proposals being put forward to resolve these problems, first by drawing attention to the marked degree of consensus reached by the major parties, and then by outlining the major points of contention. The Briefing Paper goes on to describe the main features of the economy the new government will inherit, and ends by discussing a number of key internal and external factors which will influence the economy in the years ahead. </i>
<hr>
<p>
<b>The new South Africa: policy continuity</b><br>
Two distinct sets of pressures and forces will influence the economic policies implemented in the post-election period. One set of influences follows from the importance given by policymakers to different social and economic problems, and the manner in which it is believed they should be addressed, with different external factors constraining policy implementation. The other group of pressures and influences will emerge from the strengths of different internal interest groups. At one extreme are the privileged few whose position in society - status, wealth and access to social and economic services - is most likely to be maintained by preserving the status quo. At the other extreme are the poor and previously marginalised majority (see <a href="apartheid.html" >APARTHEID'S LEGACY OF POVERTY)</a>, expecting to reduce their social and economic insecurity and improve their access to social services. 
<p>
The dominant interests of the old South Africa were: the very small number of large corporate groups, most with roots in the mining industry, and their employees; the white, and growing number of black, administrators who managed the apartheid state; and the overwhelming majority of whites, including the commercial farm sector, whose relative status was enhanced and supported by institutionalised racism. Until recently, four mining groups controlled 80% of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), with Anglo-American Corporation and De Beers owning half the value of shares quoted.
<p>
The two main political parties whose elected officials are likely to form the Government of National Unity, are the National Party (NP) and the African National Congress (ANC). The National Party has its roots in the dominant groups who benefited directly from the apartheid system, especially among the Afrikaner community. The ANC's support has come traditionally from the victims of the apartheid system and has included two particularly influential groups: the South African Communist Party and the 1.2 million members of COSATU - the Congress of South African Trade Unions.
<p>
Historically, these two parties have represented very different approaches to economic and social policy - although they both shared the conviction that the state should intervene substantially in economic life. For many years, the NP guided an economy which allocated substantial subsidies to its supporters. For many years, the ANC advocated radical change in the management and ownership of the economy, including outright nationalisation, and radical redistribution of wealth, including land. 
<p>
More recently, economic policy-making has been marked by two characteristics. First, since the late 1980s, South Africa has been awash with the views of business, academics and international institutions, particularly the IMF and the World Bank, which have sought to influence politicians in a debate about the future of the country's economy and society. Secondly, the recent period has witnessed growing areas of agreement between the two leading political parties about the nature and structure of the economy and the pace and direction of social and economic change in the post-election period.
<p>
<ul><li>Both the NP and the ANC have moved markedly away from their respective forms of faith in state intervention in the economy. From the mid-1980s, the then government began to expose the economy more to the discipline of the market. Both the NP and the ANC have accepted the general thrust of further market-oriented policies for the future. There is agreement that South Africa should have a mixed economy which engages more in the world economy, and which is driven internally more by market forces, albeit guided by a relatively active state. 
<p>
<li>There is agreement that the new government needs to expand education and health services substantially and provide housing for the black majority.
<p>
<li>There is agreement on the need to ensure that high rates of growth are achieved; that economic policies encourage the inflow of private foreign investment; and that budgetary expansion is not inflationary. Indeed, a `letter of intent' has been signed with the IMF agreeing the need to hold the budget deficit in check - key targets, such as budget deficit ratios, were not publicly disclosed. 
<p>
<li>Agreement has been reached with the GATT for South Africa to simplify its external tariff system, reducing rates on average by one third in a phased programme.
<p>
<li>An accord has been signed by the ANC and the NP, giving the Reserve Bank even more autonomy than it had previously, `provided there is regular consultation between the governor and the minister of finance'.
<p>
<li>Earlier indications that outright nationalisation of economic assets would form a substantive part of the ANC's future economic policies appear to have been set aside, though nationalisation still remains on the agendas of both COSATU and the SACP. Relatedly, though, a number of the larger conglomerates - such as the Anglo American Corporation and Gencor - have responded to criticism of the concentration of economic power and have announced measures to begin to `unbundle' their diverse assets.
</ul>
<p>
<b>The new South Africa: policy differences </b><br>
This evident, and growing, consensus on approaches to future economic policies should not, however, conceal some sharp differences which remain both between and within the major political parties. These relate mostly to two clusters of issues. 
<p>
<ul><li>The precise role to be given to the state and the market. Issues here include the emphasis to be given to supply as well as demand management issues; the extent to which the concentration of corporate power should be diluted; the linked issue of asset ownership and nationalisation; and the details of land reform (see <a href="3key.html">THREE KEY POLICY AREAS)</a>.
<p>
<li>The speed at which the majority's human resources needs, and their access to the general infrastructure, should be improved. Differences exist on how the necessary resources should be raised, and the relative importance to be given to budgetary and monetary stability.
</ul>
<p>
In <i>"The Key Issues in the Normative Economic Model" </i>(NEM) (March 1993), the National Party/de Klerk government explains its preference for changes built upon maximising growth. Structural changes are to come from the expected flexibility to be achieved by sustained and higher growth rates, which, it is hoped, will encourage significant inflows of private foreign investment. 
<p>
Specific targets in the NEM include the following: raising the gross investment-to-GDP ratio to 26% by the year 1997, reducing the budget deficit (to zero by the year 1997) and the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio from 31% in 1992 to 24% by 1997. These targets are to be achieved by maintaining a competitive exchange rate and keeping a tight grip on inflation (to be reduced to 3-6% by 1997). Another aim is to reduce the ratio of state expenditure and transfers to GDP from 27% in 1992 to 20% by 1997.
<p>
The ANC's<i> Reconstruction and Development Programme </i>(RDP) places more emphasis on processes of development than on providing specific targets for key economic indicators, its uppermost aim being to `meet the basic needs of the people'. The RDP also confirms that programmes should be financed in ways that do not cause undue inflation or balance of payments difficulties, and that the overall debt
burden should not increase. The approach `reflects a belief that growth, equity and sustainability can reinforce each other'. 
<p>
More detailed and far-reaching is the report from the Macro-Economic Research Group (MERG), set up jointly by the ANC and COSATU,<i> Making Democracy Work: a framework for macroeconomic policy in South Africa.</i> While the RDP (and not the MERG report) has been formally adopted by the ANC, MERG illustrates one way in which the general objectives of the RDP might be fleshed out more technically.
<p>
The MERG approach is to target the poor directly, and focus on providing them with the means (education, housing, health, wage levels, etc) to participate in the country's economy. It places great emphasis on infrastructural development, dominated in the first instance by public-led investment, and on easing supply bottlenecks in the economy. MERG simulations are based on maintaining (not reducing) prevailing levels of real government expenditure, and on a moderate growth (not a reduction) in government revenues as a share of GDP. Various potential dangers are acknowledged: inflation, balance of trade deficits, and large capital outflows. But it is argued that the strategy is consistent with achieving macro-economic balance, which it accepts as a target. Debate has been sharpest, or is likely to intensify in the post-election period, over three key policy areas: land and agricultural reform, industrial and trade reform and mineral rights (see <a href="3key.html">THREE KEY POLICY AREAS).</a>
<p>
<h3>THE ECONOMY THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL INHERIT</h3>
<b>The size of the economy.</b><br>
 Compared with most developing countries, South Africa's economy is large: only 10 such countries have an absolute gross domestic product (GDP) greater than South Africa. In 1992, Reserve Bank data put its GDP at Rand 327.1bn (US$114.8bn). The World Bank terms South Africa an `upper middle income' country, with a GNP per capita comparable to Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.
<p>
Within Sub-Saharan African (SSA), South Africa's economy is three times larger than the next biggest, Nigeria. Data for 1991 show the following comparisons (in which South Africa is included in data for SSA):
<p>
<ul><li>with just 7% of the total population of SSA and 5% of the total land area of the continent, South Africa accounts for 36% of total SSA GDP;
<p>
<li>South Africa's merchandise exports account for 39% of total SSA exports, its imports for 32% of the total; 
<p>
<li>South Africa produces almost the same value of manufactured goods, and exports twice the value of manufactured goods (if processed minerals are included), as the rest of SSA combined. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>The dominance of (gold) mining.</b><br>
 For most of this century, the economy has been dominated by one commodity - gold. Some 35% of world gold production takes place in South Africa (down from 74% in 1979). Gold accounts for 50% of total mineral production and for over 30% of total export earnings. Historically, diamonds played an important role in the economy but, in recent years, coal and platinum have also become major internationally-traded commodities. South Africa is ranked first in the world in terms of reserves of manganese, platinum, chromium, gold, vanadium and alumino-silicate, and number two in terms of coal, uranium, zirconium and asbestos. Minerals, including processed minerals, account for over 60% of the country's total exports. 
<p>
Profits from mining, the institutionalised division of land, and the setting of black unskilled wage levels more to single than family- based needs, combined to provide the resources in both the public and private sectors to shape the economy, and especially to help determine the pattern of agricultural and manufacturing sector development.
<p>
<b>The manufacturing sector.</b><br>
 From at least the 1920s, the government played an active and direct role in nurturing the expansion of the manufacturing sector, assisted by the establishment of a tariff regime which worked to protect the emergent manufacturing sector from foreign competition. Manufacturing grew at an annual rate of over 7.5% from 1946 to 1970, raising the ratio of manufacturing value added (MVA) to GDP from 13% to almost 25%, the typical share for a middle-income developing country. By 1970, heavy industry accounted for 60% of total manufacturing production. The economy, however, remained inward-oriented. By the early 1990s, only some 10% of manufactures were exported.
<p>
International sanctions encouraged the state to invest directly, and stimulated private sector involvement in a number of key strategic and highly capital-intensive industries including SASOL (oil from coal), MOSSGAS (offshore gas to liquid fuel), ARMSCOR (armaments), the automobile industry, the nuclear industry, and iron and steel, including stainless steel. Today, much of South Africa's manufacturing sector remains uncompetitive internationally. However, in broad terms, studies by the World Bank and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa both suggest that the sector is more competitive in capital-intensive products. 
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> <br>South African agriculture is rooted in differential racial access to land: by the early 1900s, only 13% of the total land area was apportioned for the majority black population, leaving the remainder for white settlement. As a result, South African agriculture is broadly divided into the commercial, largely white, sector and the subsistence, entirely black, sector. Overall, agriculture accounts for only between 4% and 7% of GDP, annual production being very sensitive to drought.
<p>
But agriculture, including processed products, accounts for over 20% of exports and, except in severe drought years, South Africa is a major regional food exporter. Yet the range of commercially- produced products - including livestock, horticulture, food grains, sugar, forestry and fishing - is critically influenced by the capital- intensive nature of commercial agriculture, supported by substantial state subsidies. According to World Bank studies, a substantial proportion of the 60,000 white farms appear to be economically inefficient (40% of total production originates from 1% of farms), and much white farm land is under-utilised. 
<p>
<b>Growth prospects and the lifting of sanctions. </b><br>
The new government will inherit an economy which is beginning to expand: after three years of contraction, GDP grew by an estimated 1.1% in 1993, and first quarter forecasts for 1994 suggest GDP growth of between 3% and 4%. This expansion is being boosted, in part, by the ending of sanctions. This has: eliminated the need to export at a discount and import at a premium; lowered the costs of acquiring new technologies; led to the opening up of new markets for South African products; and stimulated the resolution of South Africa's prevailing debt problems (see below) and allowed it to borrow internationally at prevailing market rates.
<p>
On balance, most of the beneficial effects of the ending of sanctions will tend to be short-lived. Nonetheless, the impact on resources of not having to implement sanctions-related projects such as SASOL, MOSSGAS and the 1980s policy of sub-regional destabilisation will be significant for the longer-term reallocation of domestic resources. 
<p>
<b>Growing unemployment.</b><br>
 Since the 1960s, the rate of economic growth has slowed, with underlying structural problems worsened by economic, and especially financial, sanctions, which became particularly effective in the post-1984 period. Even in the best post- 1945 years, new formal sector jobs were not being created at a pace fast enough to absorb all potential job-seekers. By the early 1990s, the Reserve Bank judged that some 47% of the working population were not employed in the formal sectors of the economy. In the 30 years, 1962-92, per capita GDP in South Africa has risen in real terms by only 16%. GDP per capita peaked in 1981 but since then has fallen by 17%.

</pre>
<p>
<b>Falling savings and investment ratios.</b><br>
 In the period 1983-92, the ratio of gross domestic fixed investment to GDP fell from 26% to 16%, the lowest level since 1946. The domestic savings-to-GDP ratio fell from 25% to 16%.
<p>
<b>The balance of payments.</b><br>
 South Africa has usually had a surplus on the current account of its balance of payments. Indeed, in the 5 years to 1992, it had an accumulated surplus on current account of over $9bn - largely because of a massive trade surplus of $28.5bn. This positive balance, required by a growing inability to obtain external finance because of sanctions, was made possible by the slowdown in economic activity which reduced demand for capital imports in particular: the import-to-GDP ratio fell from 23% in the mid-1980s to below 20% by the early 1990s.
<p>
The positive current account was, of course, mirrored by the performance of the capital account. In the 30 years to 1979, an almost continuous (though small) net inflow of capital funds was recorded, largely as a result of inflows of private investment. But there was a cumulative capital outflow of $16.7bn between 1985 and 1992.
<p>
The reasons for this reversal in the capital account lay largely in decisions and perceptions of private investors and bankers regarding South Africa, together with the linked expansion of trade and financial sanctions. A critical factor concerned attitudes and policies related to South Africa's external debt. 
<p>
<b>International debt.</b><br>
 South Africa has never had a major external debt problem. In 1980, total external debt of $17bn required interest payments equivalent to only 3.3% of export earnings. South Africa's particular debt crisis arose in mid-1985 because a group of creditor banks announced that they would not roll over their short-term loans. In the throes of a liquidity crisis, the government announced that it would freeze repayments of about 60% of its outstanding debt. Agreement to `regularise' external debt arrangements was finally reached in late 1993, by which time the country's total external debt had fallen to below $17bn, with the debt-service ratio less than 6%. 
<p>
In late 1993, South Africa agreed to repay the $5.17bn outstanding debt affected by the standstill agreement (32% of its total foreign debt) in half-yearly instalments to the year 2001, while the remainder of the debt, of which about 30% is medium and long term obligations, will be paid as it falls due. From 1994 to 1998, repayment commitments amount to about $2bn a year, estimated at some 2% of GDP and 8% of exports.
<p>
<b>Government finances</b> <br>
South Africa's central government budget deficit remained below 4% of GDP to the mid-1980s, when the government debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 33%. But in recent years the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio has risen significantly, reaching an average of over 4% by the early 1990s, jumping to 6.8% in the financial year 1992/93, and to an estimated 6.4% in the year 1993/94. By 1992, the ratio of government debt to GDP had risen to over 40%. Inflation averaged 12-15% in the post-1985 period, three to four times higher than in South Africa's main trading partners. Economic slowdown and tight monetary policy helped to slow the rate of inflation in recent years, and in 1993 the rate fell to an estimated 9.7%.
<p>
<h3>EXTERNAL INFLUENCES AND THE FUTURE</h3>
<b>Trade prospects</b>. <br>
For the foreseeable future, South Africa's economic growth will continue to be closely linked to the level of (largely capital) imports, whose prices are likely to continue to rise. 
<p>
The prospects for South Africa's major mineral exports are far from bullish. Greatest attention is focused on gold for which price prospects remain low compared to gold production costs in South Africa. Unless new reserves are exploited, annual production is expected to continue to contract - from current levels of some 600 tonnes to between 200 and 450 tonnes in the next 5-10 years. Yet new reserves are located in deep ore bodies which require (at current prices) a world price close to $450 a troy ounce. In early April 1994, the price was less than $390.
<p>
Prospects for chrome, nickel, zinc, copper and uranium prices remain depressed, while South Africa has continued to lose market shares in most of these minerals in the 1990s. While the world diamond market picked up in early 1994, and De Beers was able to raise prices, little major change in price or demand is expected. The best mineral export prospects for the long-term appear to lie in coal (because of its low-sulphur content and low cost) and platinum-group metals (because of rising demand for catalytic converters). However, together, these account for less than 15% of total export earnings, and the recent rise in platinum prices (South Africa produces 77% of world production) has been due more to concerns about stability in South Africa than to any change in fundamentals, while coal prices fell sharply in 1993.
<p>
<b>Concessionary capital flows.</b><br>
 Given a likely shift into trade deficit, the need to service already-contracted foreign debt and, currently, extremely low levels of domestic saving, significant capital inflows will be needed for helping to finance growth. 
<p>
South Africa has already begun drawing down funds from a $850m Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) from the IMF. It is expected that soon after the election it will arrange a series of largely sectoral loans with the World Bank, perhaps amounting to a cumulative $1bn, adding to it's foreign debt payment obligations. 
<p>
Access to additional concessionary finance, especially, official development assistance (oda), is likely to play a relatively minor role in South Africa. All the major OECD donor countries will want to mark their support for the new government with pledges of aid funds and, in the short term, this is likely to result in annual aid commitments running into several hundred million dollars. But there are unlikely to be additional aid flows on a scale which will make a significant difference to South Africa's financing requirements - $340m in oda was received already in 1992. If any additional aid commitments are made by bilateral donors or by the European Union, they are unlikely to either be large or sustained. A 50% increase over 1992 aid disbursements to about $500m would be considered large for most SSA countries; yet this represents less than 3% of South Africa's 1992 import bill and a mere 0.1% of GDP. 
<p>
<b>Foreign private investment.</b><br>
 Of far greater potential significance are the prospects for foreign private investment, portfolio and direct. South Africa is particularly well placed to benefit from the recent surge in portfolio investment in search of profitable emerging markets, not only because of its strength in African terms, but also because of its high dividend yield and its recent return to growth. In the year to March 1994, the dollar index of the JSE rose by almost 20%; net foreign investment in bonds and equities totalled Rand 4.23bn in 1993, compared with Rand 313m in 1992. While this upsurge of foreign interest is welcome, and may well continue, it provides a risky basis on which to build long-term growth. (see <a href="sa_int_trade.html">SOUTH AFRICA AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE</a>)
<p>
Historically, private direct foreign investment (DFI) has played a key role in the economy. It is unlikely, however, that in the next 2-3 years there will be a major surge in new private direct capital investment. There are three major reasons for this. 
<p>
<ul><li>The best guide to future DFI is current levels of DFI. While the outflow of the 1980s period has already been reversed - over 130 new foreign investments were made in the three-year period to mid- 1993, and the pace has quickened since then - the size of new investment is still small in comparison with the 1960s and the 1970s. Part of the reason for this is a substantial presence of foreign companies in South Africa. Although over 250 foreign companies disinvested in the 1980s, many retained a presence. Most disinvesting companies were North American; most investors from the EU stayed, and investment by Asian companies, though still small, continued to increase. There are already over 600 foreign firms with direct investment or employees in South Africa. 
<p>
<li>Most potential investors are unlikely to commit substantial amounts of new capital until they are assured that the level of political violence will be significantly reduced: non-equity involvement is often first favoured by new entrants. In addition, new investors are unlikely to commit large equity funds to South Africa until it becomes clearer what investment and locational incentives will be offered. Some are likely, too, to wait until trade and financial arrangements between South Africa and its neighbours, especially the members of the Southern African Customs' Union (SACU), are clarified.
<p>
<li>While foreign companies will look favourably at South Africa because of its position as a regional centre of economic activity, perhaps in some cases providing a base for extending global activities, it is unlikely that major investment decisions will be made until the timing and extent of South Africa's own trade liberalisation programme becomes clearer.
</ul><p>
Nonetheless, private FDI inflows will continue. At a minimum, there is evidence that South Africa is being viewed as a more favourable locale for investment than the former Soviet republics, not least because of the investment commitments already made in the country by international capital.
<p>
<h3>INTERNAL PRESSURES AND INFLUENCES</h3>
The new government will be subjected to an array of domestic pressures and constraints. While external pressures will especially influence the level of economic activity, internal factors are more likely to influence both the pace and the nature of change. 
<p>
Most immediately the government will face pressures to demonstrate its commitment to both a steady expansion of jobs, and greatly improved access to housing and electricity, education, health services, and land. It is likely to find it difficult to resist quickly expanding social programmes. Pressures to increase the budget deficit beyond the level which it considers prudent are likely to be intense: they will be even harder to resist if (or when) the pace of economic growth begins to slacken.
<p>
Zimbabwean experience suggests that it is easier (because quicker) to redress discrimination in access to social services by going for quantitative expansion: providing schools and clinics where there were none before. There is, however, a grave risk that the quality of service provided will be poor, resulting in the new facilities being severely under-utilised as potential users either stay at home or search out higher quality alternatives.
<p>
A further implication of the need to provide tangible results to an electorate with high expectations of rapid change is that the government is likely to find itself devoting a large amount of time and energy addressing a series of direct and immediate issues. This will tend to push even further into the background some of the more substantive structural issues of the economy which will need to be addressed. As a result, the government will be likely to grow increasingly cautious about challenging the economic power, income and profits of those interest groups who are responsible for providing a large share of formal sector jobs, and who play a major role in influencing the views of foreign investors (and sometimes donors) about the economy and its prospects.
<p>
Across a country which is already deeply divided, and in which political violence has been widespread, the new government requires peace in order to provide the conditions necessary for sustained growth. But the prospects for peace are themselves partly dependent upon evidence that job opportunities are increasing and basic services becoming more readily available. A mix of too high expectations of employment growth and poverty eradication could quickly lead to disillusion, thus making the return to peace even more difficult to achieve. One fear is that disillusion about the future (fuelled by violence) will stimulate a skills exodus, exacerbating the serious skills
problems which South Africa already faces. 
<p>
Providing the tangible benefits which both South Africa and the international community desire will depend critically on the ability of the government to implement its new policy agenda. Here again, South Africa faces a difficult future. The core of the apartheid state was set up to promote the interests of the white minority, and its policies were executed by civil servants broadly supportive of their own interests. To the extent that the needs of the majority were serviced at all by the state, the administration was riddled with inefficiencies. In more recent years, the administration of the 'homelands' spawned hundreds of thousands of new unproductive jobs, leading to a significant duplication of services. There is growing evidence of corruption. Thus the new government will be faced with the need both to address the inefficiencies of the old system and to attempt to put in place a system capable of administering more complex and far-reaching tasks. 
<p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
Most South Africans are profoundly aware of the extent and depth of the social and economic problems which they face. Yet, in spite of all these problems and the continued violence which has marked the election period, there exists a significant degree of optimism across the country. Such optimism is important to the discussion of the country's economic future because international experience suggests that sound performance is often dependent upon people and nations believing that they can achieve the goals they have set for themselves, overcoming major obstacles in the process. 
<p>
International experience also suggests that the outside world will be more ready to praise any success in South Africa, when it occurs, than it will be to provide resources and assistance to the level required to help ensure such success. South Africa's economic future and its ability to steer itself away from the violence of the apartheid system thus depend crucially on the ability and commitment of its own people to work together to build that future.

<h3>SOUTH AFRICA AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE</h3>
<hr>
It is not yet known what trading arrangements South Africa will have with its two major partners, the European Union (EU) and North America. However significant preferential arrangements are not expected - a view reinforced by the imposition of five year 50% anti- dumping tariffs on South African exports of ferro-silicon to the EU in March. More importantly, the global reductions in tariff and non- tariff barriers as a result of the recent GATT agreements, together with the (eventual) dismantling of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, will increase the need for South Africa to compete internationally in terms of price and quality. This will hasten the need to address the problems of its protected industries, even if some gains in terms of agricultural exports can be expected from implementing the GATT agreements.

<P>
<B>L'enseignement sup&#233;rieur se trouve, en cette fin de mill&#233;naire,
dans une situation paradoxale. Il conna&icirc;t, d'une part, une croissance sans
pr&#233;c&#233;dent : les incriptions ne cessent d'augmenter, de m&ecirc;me
que les attentes de la soci&#233;t&#233; &#224; son &#233;gard. Le lien entre
l'investissement dans l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur et la recherche et le
niveau de d&#233;veloppement social, &#233;conomique et culturel des nations
est d&#233;sormais &#233;tabli, voire renforc&#233; &#224; l'heure o&ugrave;
la forte intensit&#233; du savoir caract&#233;rise toutes les formes de
d&#233;veloppement. L'enseignement sup&#233;rieur conna&icirc;t, d'autre
part, une situation de crise dans pratiquement tous les pays du monde en
raison de pressions financi&#232;res majeures. Il se trouve en concurrence
avec de nombreux autres secteurs pour l'obtention de ressources publiques et 
il  est g&#233;n&#233;ralement parmi les premiers vis&#233;s lorsqu'il s'agit de
comprimer les budgets. Ces coupes sombres ont fini par mettre l'enseignement
sup&#233;rieur en p&#233;ril dans de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement.
Jamais, dans le domaine de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur et de la recherche,
le foss&#233; n'a &#233;t&#233; aussi profond entre les PVD et les nations
industrialis&#233;es, et il continue de se creuser.</b>
<p>
     La coop&#233;ration inter-universitaire est  un outil pr&#233;cieux de soutien
&#224; l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement et  un
m&#233;canisme flexible permettant le transfert rapide et la mise en commun des
connaissances au travers de liens et &#233;changes entre universit&#233;s. Comme
le pr&#233;cise le document d'orientation pour le changement et le
d&#233;veloppement dans l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur, publi&#233; par l'Unesco
en 1995, l'urgence en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration internationale dans le
domaine de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur r&#233;side dans l'inversion du
processus de d&#233;clin des &#233;tablissements situ&#233;s dans les pays en
d&#233;veloppement, et dans les pays les moins avanc&#233;s plus
particuli&#232;rement. L'internationalisation de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur a
r&#233;guli&#232;rement progress&#233;, soutenue,  d'une part, par les processus
actuels d'int&#233;gration &#233;conomique et politique et les progr&#232;s
accomplis par les technologies de l'information et de la communication, d'autre part.
Comme le rappelle le Rapport mondial sur l'&#233;ducation (Unesco, 1993), elle est
toutefois davantage soumise  aux lois de la concurrence du march&#233;. Les
universit&#233;s ont &#233;t&#233; vivement incit&#233;es &#224; faire preuve d'un
esprit d'entreprise et d'un sens commercial plus pouss&#233;s et &#224; envisager 
la coop&#233;ration internationale essentiellement comme une source de revenus
suppl&#233;mentaires. Les frais d'inscription demand&#233;s aux &#233;tudiants
&#233;trangers ont &#233;t&#233; sensiblement augment&#233;s dans de nombreux
pays, avec pour cons&#233;quence que la mobilit&#233; acad&#233;mique est
devenue un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne davantage Nord-Nord que Sud-Nord ou Sud-Sud.
Nul ne songe &#224; nier les avantages des &#233;tudes &#224; l'&#233;tranger,
des &#233;changes, du travail en r&#233;seau et de l'acc&#232;s aux donn&#233;es.
Les co&ucirc;ts que ces d&#233;marches impliquent en font toutefois un
privil&#232;ge r&#233;serv&#233; aux mieux nantis.
<p>
<H3>Un programme innovateur</H3>
<p>
     L'Unesco a r&#233;agi &#224; cette situation par la cr&#233;ation, en 1991,
du programme des chaires Unitwin/Unesco. S'il sert &#224; stimuler une
coop&#233;ration globale entre les universit&#233;s, ce programme a toutefois une
orientation et un objectif plus pr&#233;cis, &#224; savoir apporter son soutien &#224;
l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement. Il veut
marquer le retour &#224; un esprit de solidarit&#233; acad&#233;mique internationale
par le biais de jumelages, de mises en r&#233;seau et d'autres modalit&#233;s
relationnelles entre les universit&#233;s. Sa conception m&ecirc;me en fait un
programme innovateur en termes de transfert rapide des connaissances et de
d&#233;veloppement institutionnel au niveau de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur (y
compris la cr&#233;ation de centres transnationaux de recherche et d'&#233;tudes
avanc&#233;es) destin&#233; &#224; combler l'&#233;cart de plus en plus important
entre le niveau des connaissances dans les pays industriels et dans les pays en
d&#233;veloppement. Le programme vise en outre &#224; att&#233;nuer les
r&#233;percussions n&#233;gatives du "brain drain".
<p>
     Le programme des chaires Unitwin/Unesco a connu un d&#233;veloppement
r&#233;gulier et dynamique d&#232;s son lancement pour devenir le moteur principal
de l'action de l'Unesco dans le domaine de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur, le cadre
institutionnel privil&#233;gi&#233; dans ce contexte &#233;tant une chaire Unesco.
Le programme comporte des activit&#233;s extr&ecirc;mement diversifi&#233;es
telles que la nomination de professeurs invit&#233;s, l'octroi de bourses
universitaires, l'organisation d'&#233;changes de professeurs et d'&#233;tudiants et
la mise en oeuvre de travaux de recherche en commun. L'unit&#233; de base, qu'il
s'agisse de recherche ou de formation, est la "chaire", qui rev&ecirc;t une dimension
internationale importante puisque son titulaire, ou certains professeurs ou chercheurs
associ&#233;s &#224; son programme, viennent de l'&#233;tranger. D'autres projets
visent &#224; la cr&#233;ation de r&#233;seaux inter-universitaires complexes dont
la taille peut varier entre trois et plus de cinquante &#233;tablissements. Certains de
ceux-ci servent de points de convergence au sein des r&#233;seaux : ils sont
charg&#233;s de lancer les activit&#233;s ainsi que de veiller &#224; une
participation aussi large que possible &#224; leur ex&#233;cution. Des programmes
de coop&#233;ration ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233;s entre
l'Unesco et les grands r&#233;seaux et associations universitaires en vue de mener
&#224; bien les activit&#233;s connexes au programme Unitwin.
<p>
     On compte actuellement 163 chaires Unesco en place (et 84 autres &#224;
l'&#233;tude) ainsi que 34 r&#233;seaux &#224; grande &#233;chelle (et 18 en
phase de d&#233;veloppement). Ces activit&#233;s impliquent plus de 750
enseignants, chercheurs et autre personnel d'appui. On estime &#224; 350 le nombre
de cours (essentiellement dispens&#233;s au niveau du 2&#232;me cycle et auxquels
ont assist&#233; 7.500 &#233;tudiants) organis&#233;s entre 1992 et 1996 par les
chaires Unesco en place. Cent-vingt s&#233;minaires, ateliers de formation,
symposiums et colloques ont &#233;t&#233; organis&#233;s au cours de la
m&ecirc;me p&#233;riode, et plus de 6.000 personnes y ont particip&#233;.
Pr&#232;s de 580 membres du personnel acad&#233;mique de pays en
d&#233;veloppement ont effectu&#233; de brefs s&#233;jours dans des
universit&#233;s-partenaires des pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s afin d'y parfaire leur
formation. Le programme a accord&#233; en outre 355 bourses &#224; des
&#233;tudiants et &#224; de jeunes membres du personnel acad&#233;mique
originaires de pays en d&#233;veloppement. La recherche a &#233;t&#233;
stimul&#233;e au travers de 240 projets qui, men&#233;s en commun pour la plupart,
ont abouti &#224; ce jour, selon les rapports disponibles, &#224; la publication de 55
ouvrages, d'une centaine d'articles et de plus de 150 monographies et rapports
d'activit&#233;.
<p>
<H3>La participation des ACP au programme</H3>
<p>
     Beaucoup de ces projets (chaires Unesco et r&#233;seaux) concernent les
pays ACP. La priorit&#233; a &#233;t&#233; donn&#233;e &#224; l'Afrique puisque
plus de 30 des chaires install&#233;es s'y trouvent et que 18 autres sont &#224;
l'&#233;tude pour l'Afrique subsaharienne afin d'intensifier la contribution du
programme au d&#233;veloppement de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur dans cette
r&#233;gion. Certains projets men&#233;s dans des &#233;tablissements
europ&#233;ens et nord-am&#233;ricains couvrent, en outre, des activit&#233;s
destin&#233;es &#224; soutenir des universit&#233;s africaines. En voici quelques
exemples. L'Universit&#233; d'Utrecht s'est propos&#233; de d&#233;velopper les
relations bilat&#233;rales qu'elle entretenait avec plusieurs universit&#233;s
africaines, en un projet multilat&#233;ral &#233;largi sous l'&#233;gide d'Unitwin. Elle
s'est associ&#233;e &#224; cette fin avec trois autres &#233;tablissements
europ&#233;ens : l'Universit&#233; de Lund (Su&#232;de), l'Universit&#233; de la
Ruhr &#224; Bochum (Allemagne) et l'Universit&#233; de Porto (Portugal). Cette
collaboration a conduit &#224; la cr&#233;ation du r&#233;seau USU
(Utrecht/Southern Africa/Unitwin) qui comprend, &#224; son p&ocirc;le
m&#233;ridional, les universit&#233;s de Harare, de Maputo, de Namibie et du Cap
o&ugrave; des chaires Unesco ont &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233;es dans diverses
disciplines. L'objectif est de transformer chacune d'elles en centre (sub-
)r&#233;gional de recherche et d'&#233;tudes avanc&#233;es. Les choses
progressent bien en ce qui concerne la chaire Unesco d'enseignement des
math&#233;matiques et des sciences &#224; la Western Cape University (Le Cap,
Afrique du Sud). La premi&#232;re &#233;tape a &#233;t&#233; la cr&#233;ation
d'un lien entre ses activit&#233;s et celles du projet MESA (Mathematics Education
in South Africa), men&#233; en coop&#233;ration entre l'Institut Utrecht-Freundenthal
d'enseignement des math&#233;matiques et l'Universit&#233; du Cap, o&ugrave; une
&#233;cole d'enseignement des sciences et des math&#233;matiques va &ecirc;tre
cr&#233;&#233;e.
<p>
     Le r&#233;seau des instituts africains de formation p&#233;dagogique,
articul&#233; autour de la Chaire Unesco de l'Ecole Normale Sup&#233;rieure de
Dakar, constitue un autre projet &#224; grande &#233;chelle. Il se veut un centre
r&#233;gional de formation post-universitaire et de recherche en mati&#232;re
d'enseignement. Apr&#232;s plusieurs ann&#233;es de pr&#233;paration, ses
activit&#233;s ont d&#233;marr&#233; en 1995. L'efficacit&#233; du travail en
r&#233;seau est attest&#233;e par plusieurs autres accords de liaison destin&#233;s
&#224; aider les &#233;tablissements africains d'enseignement sup&#233;rieur. On
peut citer &#224; cet &#233;gard le r&#233;seau initi&#233; par le groupe
d'universit&#233;s europ&#233;ennes Natura dans le domaine de l'agriculture, le
R&#233;seau Orbicom dans le domaine de la communication, qui est un r&#233;seau
mondial mais  qui se pr&#233;occupe plus particuli&#232;rement des besoins des
universit&#233;s africaines, ainsi que le r&#233;seau et le partenariat institu&#233;s
par l'Unesco et l'Universit&#233; John Hopkins en mati&#232;re de
d&#233;veloppement et de sant&#233; des adolescents. Ce dernier projet est
principalement consacr&#233; &#224; la recherche sur le VIH/SIDA, et inclut des
&#233;tablissements tels que les universit&#233;s d'Addis-Abeba et de Makerere.
<p>
     L'accord sign&#233; entre l'Unesco et l'Association des universit&#233;s
africaines (AUA) dans le cadre d'Unitwin pr&#233;voit une assistance &#224; la
formation du personnel et un programme de gestion &#224; l'intention des
universit&#233;s africaines en question. Une chaire Unesco de gestion et
d'administration dans le domaine de l'&#233;ducation y sera instaur&#233;e. Elle
fonctionnera par roulement entre plusieurs universit&#233;s d'Afrique du Sud, du
Botswana et du Malawi. Il existe par ailleurs toute une s&#233;rie de chaires "sur
mesure" tenant compte des besoins plus sp&#233;cifiques des &#233;tablissements
en d&#233;velopant notamment leurs capacit&#233;s de formation et de recherche
dans des domaines tels que les droits de l'homme, la d&#233;mocratie et la paix
(&#224; l'Universit&#233; de Namibie, d'Addis-Abeba et de Fianarantsoa &#224;
Madagascar) ou dans le domaine des ressources hydriques et de la culture de l'eau
(&#224; l'Universit&#233; du Malawi et d'Omdurman au Soudan). Un exemple
int&#233;ressant m&#233;rite d'&ecirc;tre cit&#233; &#224; propos de ce dernier
domaine : il s'agit de la chaire Unesco cr&#233;&#233;e &#224; l'Universit&#233; de
Nice qui, bien que situ&#233;e en France, m&#232;ne ses activit&#233;s en
Mauritanie et a produit l'&#233;tude la plus compl&#232;te &#224; ce jour concernant
la gestion des ressources hydriques dans ce pays.
<p>
     Le programme a &#233;galement bien d&#233;marr&#233; dans le Pacifique
et les Cara&iuml;bes, m&ecirc;me si les r&#233;sultats sont plus modestes dans ces
r&#233;gions. Vingt-deux chaires sont d&#233;j&#224; &#233;tablies et 14 autres
sont envisag&#233;es. Elles couvrent un large &#233;ventail de domaines prioritaires,
y compris l'utilisation durable des for&ecirc;ts tropicales (Universit&#233; du Guyana),
la gestion de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur et les technologies de l'information
(Universit&#233; de La Havane &#224; Cuba), les sciences  p&#233;dagogiques
(Fidji) et l'usage des stup&#233;fiants (Universit&#233; de Chulalongkorn en
Tha&iuml;lande).
<p>
     L'Unesco travaille en &#233;troite collaboration avec l'Universit&#233; du
Pacifique Sud et l'Universit&#233; des Indes occidentales avec lesquelles elle a
cr&#233;&#233; 4 chaires.  Dans le cadre d'Unitwin,elle a en outre  sign&#233; un
accord de coop&#233;ration avec le Secr&#233;tariat du Commonwealth et
l'Association des Universit&#233;s du Commonwealth en vue d'activit&#233;s
communes dans les deux r&#233;gions. Il  y existe un potentiel majeur de
d&#233;veloppement du programme des chaires  en raison m&ecirc;me de
l'existence de ces deux universit&#233;s r&#233;gionales et du vif int&#233;r&ecirc;t
manifest&#233; par les universit&#233;s de nombreux pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s
(Australie, Canada, Japon et Espagne notamment) qui sont dispos&#233;es &#224;
soutenir le programme,  lequel semble particuli&#232;rement adapt&#233; aux
syst&#232;mes d'enseignement sup&#233;rieur des deux r&#233;gions.
<p>
<H3>Le financement</H3>
<p>
     Le co&ucirc;t de la coop&#233;ration internationale dans le domaine de
l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur a r&#233;guli&#232;rement augment&#233; et
constitue actuellement l'un des principaux obstacles &#224; l'exploitation
int&#233;grale du potentiel offert par les liens acad&#233;miques. Les nouvelles
technologies de l'information et de la communication contribuent &#224; une certaine
r&#233;duction de ce co&ucirc;t mais les universit&#233;s des pays les moins
avanc&#233;s auraient besoin d'investissements consid&#233;rables pour
l'acquisition et la maintenance des &#233;quipements n&#233;cessaires. Aussi
l'Unesco a-t-elle bas&#233; son programme des chaires sur des principes de
financement visant &#224; une baisse des co&ucirc;ts et &#224; leur partage dans
un v&#233;ritable esprit de solidarit&#233; acad&#233;mique.
<p>
     D&#232;s le d&#233;part, n'&#233;tant pas elle-m&ecirc;me un organisme de
financement, l'Unesco a clairement sp&#233;cifi&#233; qu'elle ne pouvait  pas
assumer la charge financi&#232;re d'un programme aussi ambitieux, impliquant
plusieurs centaines d'institutions et des milliers de professeurs, de chercheurs et
d'&#233;tudiants universitaires. Elle s'est toutefois engag&#233;e &#224; apporter les
fonds initiaux. On estime qu'au cours de la p&#233;riode 1992-95, l'Unesco a
contribu&#233; au programme des chaires Unitwin/Unesco &#224; concurrence de
2,5 millions de dollars (&#233;manant de ses programmes ordinaires et de ses
programmes de participation, de sa banque de bourses et de ses fonds en
d&#233;p&ocirc;t). Elle a insist&#233; dans le m&ecirc;me temps en faveur d'une
augmentation de l'aide internationale en mati&#232;re d'enseignement
sup&#233;rieur, en particulier de la part des pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s et des
organisations internationales, y compris les agences sp&#233;cialis&#233;es des
Nations Unies. La mise en commun des ressources et la participation directe des
&#233;tablissements d'enseignement sup&#233;rieur eux-m&ecirc;mes sont vivement
recommand&#233;es.
<p>
     Les projets s'inscrivant dans le programme Unitwin, y compris les chaires de
l'Unesco, d&#233;marrent g&#233;n&#233;ralement gr&#226;ce &#224; sa
contribution directe  (laquelle s'&#233;l&#232;ve g&#233;n&#233;ralement de 15.000
&#224; 25.000 $ par projet). Cette mise de fonds vise &#224; assurer la
pr&#233;paration et le lancement des projets ainsi que l'obtention de ressources
financi&#232;res &#233;manant d'autres sources. Les &#233;tablissements eux-
m&ecirc;mes doivent inclure les montants allou&#233;s aux diff&#233;rents projets
dans leurs propres budgets et demander aux autorit&#233;s nationales
comp&#233;tentes d'y apporter &#233;galement leur contribution. Ce principe
s'applique de la m&ecirc;me mani&#232;re aux universit&#233;s des pays en
d&#233;veloppement, aussi limit&#233;es que soient leurs ressources. Cette
d&#233;marche vise &#224; confirmer qu'elles consid&#232;rent, tout comme leurs
instances nationales, le projet concern&#233; comme une priorit&#233;.
<p>
     Le syst&#232;me actuel de financement de l'Unitwin engendre un optimisme
prudent. Plusieurs projets sont parvenus &#224; obtenir des fonds aupr&#232;s des
diverses sources cit&#233;es plus haut. Ainsi, le Projet USU  a
b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d'une premi&#232;re allocation de 50.000 dollars de la
part de l'Unesco en 1993 afin de pouvoir d&#233;marrer ses activit&#233;s.
L'importance de cette contribution s'explique par l'ampleur du projet (un r&#233;seau
de huit universit&#233;s avec la cr&#233;ation de quatre chaires dans quatre
universit&#233;s africaines et une &#224; l'Universit&#233; d'Utrecht). Ce premier
versement a &#233;t&#233; suivi d'une seconde allocation de 70.000 $ en 1994 pour
la mise en oeuvre concr&#232;te des activit&#233;s en Afrique. Ces capitaux
d'amor&#231;age de l'Unesco ont permis de r&#233;colter d'autres ressources -
600.000 $ par an au cours de la p&#233;riode 1992-95 provenant de divers
donateurs n&#233;erlandais (principalement le Minist&#232;re de la
Coop&#233;ration au D&#233;veloppement via la Nuffic) et de l'Union
europ&#233;enne, et 450.000 $ &#233;margeant au budget de l'Universit&#233;
d'Utrecht, y compris le co&ucirc;t total du fonctionnement de la chaire de l'Unesco
d'&#233;tudes africaines mise en place dans cette universit&#233;. Les trois autres
universit&#233;s europ&#233;ennes participant au r&#233;seau (Bochum, Lund et
Porto) ont &#233;galement apport&#233; leur contribution et recherchent des
donateurs dans leurs pays respectifs. Il est important de souligner que les quatre
universit&#233;s africaines membres du r&#233;seau ont &#233;galement
allou&#233; des fonds aux projets Unitwin sur leurs propres budgets et recherchent
activement un financement compl&#233;mentaire aupr&#232;s de programmes d'aide
et de d&#233;veloppement mis en place dans leur pays par divers organismes
donateurs.
<p>
     On peut affirmer qu'en termes d'efficacit&#233; au niveau des co&ucirc;ts et
de la capacit&#233; de g&#233;n&#233;rer des ressources en provenance de
sources diverses, Unitwin se d&#233;brouille plut&ocirc;t mieux que d'autres
programmes de coop&#233;ration en mati&#232;re d'enseignement sup&#233;rieur
et de recherche. Il serait pr&#233;matur&#233; toutefois de conclure que ce
programme peut se poursuivre et se d&#233;velopper sur la base des
modalit&#233;s actuelles de financement. Les besoins sont, de toute &#233;vidence,
trop importants pour les &#233;tablissements et les particuliers qui y participent - et
qui finiront pas &ecirc;tre confront&#233;s &#224; une perp&#233;tuelle recherche
de fonds. Le programme fait actuellement l'objet d'une &#233;valuation qui sera
pr&#233;sent&#233;e aux Etats membres en vue d'une d&#233;cision de leur part.
L'Unesco esp&#232;re que ses efforts de redynamisation de la solidarit&#233;
acad&#233;mique et sa campagne en faveur de l'enseignement sup&#233;rieur dans
les pays en d&#233;veloppement b&#233;n&#233;ficieront du soutien de la
communaut&#233; internationale. Plus que jamais, ces pays doivent renforcer leur
capacit&#233; de formation et recherche avanc&#233;es dans la perspective d'un
d&#233;veloppement autonome et durable. La communaut&#233; acad&#233;mique
a d'ores et d&#233;j&#224; exprim&#233; sa volont&#233; d'unir ses efforts &#224;
ceux de l'Unesco dans la r&#233;alisation de cet objectif.

<center><h1>From Hiroshima to Mururoa</h1></center>


<font size=-1> <br>
The atomic mushroom cloud over Nagasaki.  11.02am, August 9 1945.<br>Will the nuclear nightmare ever end?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Photo ©: World Conference Against A and H Bombs
</font><br clear=left>

The irony probably went unnoticed in the corridors of the Palais de l'Elys&eacute;e, as the newly-installed President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, made his fateful decision.<p>

Just as the rest of the world would be remembering the nuclear devastation unleashed on the two Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, France would be preparing to continue the atomic race.<p>

By rejecting a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing, France will also be endangering the fragile movement of other countries towards nuclear disarmament.  It may even undermine the long-term prospects of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) itself.<p>

Chirac's decision was greeted by immediate international outrage.  New Zealand's Foreign Minister bitterly criticised the "Napoleonic arrogance" of the French.  Australia called the move "deplorable" - and its citizens joined those of many Pacific countries in beginning a boycott of French goods.  <p>

On 1 August diplomatic relations between France and Australia took an even more dramatic turn for the worse.  In protest at the resumption of testing, the Australian government prevented a French-owned aircraft company from bidding for a military contract.  An outraged Chirac recalled the French ambassador from Canberra to protest against Australia's "discrimination".<p>


<h2>Can the Net stop French testing?</h2>

Neither has the world community of Internet users been standing idle.  Over 40,000 have filled in an electronic petition, maintained by two Japanese physics students at Tokyo University - Yuichi Nishihara and Shimizu Seishi - to be delivered to Jacques Chirac on August 15.<p>

The petition started life as an Internet chain letter, which multiplied so many times that system administrators all over the world sent angry protest mail to Nishihara.  His response was to design a World-Wide Web 'form', which is collecting petitioners' names without overloading the systems.<p>

President Chirac's response is that the tests are necessary to maintain the integrity of France's nuclear arsenal.  It seems likely that there are deeper motives, however.  Anti-nuclear campaigners claim that the tests are aimed at modernising the country's nuclear stockpile - in order to develop increasingly powerful weapons of mass destruction.<p>

The bomb that destroyed Hiroshima killed 140,000 people.  Subsequent test explosions - by the U.S., China, the Soviet Union, France and Britain - have been of warheads with thousands of times the destructive capability of that single weapon.  The world has no need of this continually-improved nuclear arsenal.  <p>

The best way to honour the memories of those killed and wounded at Hiroshima and Nagasaki would be to draw up a complete ban on the testing and stockpiling of nuclear weapons.  In the absence of this solid progress, all the commemorations and ceremonies to mark the anniversaries of the bombing will be pointless.<p>

<center><h2>BEIJING CONFERENCE ON WOMEN <br> SEPTEMBER 4 1995</h2>
</center> 



<i>In the run up to the UN World Conference on Women, you may be focusing on the situation of women in different parts of the world. This page gives brief information about relevant Save the Children projects which may be of interest. </i><p>

<hr><p>


<h3>Tajikistan in Central Asia - helping women who head the household.</h3>

Civil war in Tajikistan in 1992 and 1993 has left some villages in which there are virtually no men. Households are headed by women who are caring for families while coping with the stress and trauma they suffered as a result of the fighting. Save the Children is working with households in the Khotlan region to help them become more self sufficient. The charity is giving the most vulnerable families items like sewing machines, fruit trees and livestock so that they can re build their lives and improve their family incomes. It's also helping community groups develop so that women can work together to deal with their shared problems of security and access to basic supplies. <p>


<h3>Mali in West Africa - credit scheme means women can boost family incomes.</h3>

In the village of Attara a Save the Children credit scheme has helped women get involved in small scale trading and so improve their families' incomes. The women were effectively excluded from the formal banking system which is biased against small loans and against illiterate clients. Now women are lent small amounts of money. As one member of each group repays the money, another is given a loan. A staff member from Save the Children visits the village every week to keep an eye on progress and collect re payments. She has also lead a literacy course so that the women involved could keep records of their accounts. The Attara project has been so successful that Save the Children is setting up other women's credit schemes in Mali. NB: Save the Children also operates or supports credit schemes aimed at women in Vietnam and Pakistan.<p>


<h3>Pakistan - helping girls get an education. </h3>

If you're a girl in the Thar desert area of Pakistan you're unlikely to go to school. Girls made up less than 10 percent of the primary school population last time statistics were collected (1999 to 1991). Save the Children's Tharparkar Rural Development Programme is working to give more girls access to the education they need. The programme has set up 13 primary schools in remote villages. That means nearly 300 more female pupils in areas in which, before now, girls had no chance of schooling. Save the Children is also working to increase the number of female teachers, supporting girls to help them finish their secondary education and reach the standards needed for teaching. <p>


NB: In Tilonia in Rajasthan, India Save the Children supports "shepherd schools" providing education at night for children who look after livestock during the day. The vast majority of the pupils are girls.<p>



<h3>Cambodia - training midwives to meet the needs of mothers. </h3>

After the Pol Pot years, there were few trained nurses or midwives in Cambodia. Save the Children is helping remedy the situation by providing help and funding for the Cambodian Midwives Association. The idea is to improve midwifery standards and so help improve the long term health and welfare of mothers and children. Save the Children is also taking part in a major survey looking at maternal mortality (mothers dying because of complications in pregnancy or delivery) and knowledge of birth spacing. Local midwives in Phnom Penh and the ten rural provinces will carry out the work.<p>



<h3>Rosemount in Glasgow - training and support helps women out of poverty.</h3>

The Royston area of Glasgow is one of the poorest communities in Europe. Here, Save the Children's Rosemount project works to give local women the chance to find their way out of the poverty trap. The project provides courses in computing and childcare. Mothers are able to take part because Rosemount offers day care and out- of-school provision for their children at the same time. The courses not only five women skills to improve their chances of taking up employment or further education, but also help them regain their self-confidence.<p>

NB: Save the Children provides or helps provide training for women at other UK projects too.<p>


<h3>Hopscotch in London - a welcoming centre for isolated Asian women and girls.</h3>


In the Somerstown area of north London, Save the Children is helping Bengali women adapt to live in a new country. The Hopscotch Asian Women's centre provides advice on housing, health and schools and classes in subjects like English and health care. Hopscotch's practical help is valuable. But equally important is its welcoming atmosphere, helping women who are often isolated and afraid make new friends and gain more confidence. <p>

<title>PRESS RELEASE - DISASTER RELIEF FOR CHINA'S EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS</title>

<h3>DISASTER RELIEF FOR CHINA'S EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS </h3>
 
12 February 1996 
<p>

Save the Children is channelling $252,000 worth of aid to survivors of last week's earthquake in China. The charity will use this money, swiftly provided by the Overseas Development Administration and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), to purchase padded jackets for children, blankets and rice. <p>


The earthquake in Lijiang (Yunnan Province) left at least 300 people dead, 14,000 injured and up to one million homeless. Save the Children is concerned about the effects on children's health, as the region is in the grip of record low temperatures and unusually heavy snowfalls, and many are without adequate shelter. There is also concern over the food situation, as many roads are damaged in this mountainous area, with many settlements isolated by snowdrifts. <p>


Save the Children has already sent 3,500 blankets which will be distributed by local authorities. Tomorrow a health advisor and relief co-ordinator will fly out to the affected area to conduct a rapid assessment of children's needs with regard to shelter, drinking water, clothing and food. The possibility of further aftershocks may exacerbate the emergency situation. Save the Children will continue to monitor the situation closely and seek further funding for assistance if necessary.<p>

<P>
<B>On parle peu, et l'on conna&icirc;t donc mal,
le r&ocirc;le jou&#233; par le Commonwealth
dans le progr&#232;s social et &#233;conomique
de ses Etats membres. Depuis plus de 25 ans
pourtant, le CFTC (Fonds du Commonwealth
pour la coop&#233;ration technique) a largement
soutenu les efforts des pays membres en
d&#233;veloppement afin d'acc&#233;l&#233;rer
le rythme de leur croissance
&#233;conomique.</b>
<p>
     L'approche du Commonwealth en
mati&#232;re d'assistance au
d&#233;veloppement repose sur sa
reconnaissance de l'homme en tant que
ressource principale. Il fournit donc, &#224; court
terme, les comp&#233;tences techniques
manquantes ou insuffisantes afin de permettre
aux gouvernements concern&#233;s de pourvoir
&#224; des postes cl&#233;s dans des domaines
aussi divers que les exportations et la promotion
industrielle, les services juridiques et
&#233;conomiques de haut niveau, etc.; et,
&#224; plus long terme, il assure tout un
&#233;ventail de programmes de formation dans
les secteurs consid&#233;r&#233;s comme les
piliers du d&#233;veloppement
&#233;conomique.
<p>
     Le Fonds du Commonwealth pour la
coop&#233;ration technique est financ&#233; par
une contribution volontaire des gouvernements
membres, lesquels en sont &#233;galement,
comme nous venons de le dire, les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires &#233;ventuels selon
leurs besoins et leurs priorit&#233;s. Pionnier en
mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration technique
entre pays en d&#233;veloppement, le Fonds y
recrute ses experts et favorise la
coop&#233;ration Nord-Sud. On peut voir ainsi
des ressortissants ouest-africains remplir, sur la
base d'un contrat de courte dur&#233;e, des
fonctions de cadre juridique dans de lointaines
&icirc;les du Pacifique, ou des Sri Lankais ou
Indiens enseigner de nouvelles techniques
agricoles en Afrique. Le Fonds est
g&#233;r&#233; par quatre d&#233;partements
distincts au sein du Secr&#233;tariat du
Commonwealth : le d&#233;partement
charg&#233; de la gestion et de la formation ; le
d&#233;partement charg&#233; de l'assistance
technique g&#233;n&#233;rale ; le
d&#233;partement pour la promotion des
exportations et de l'industrie ; et le
d&#233;partement de consultance
&#233;conomique et juridique. En 1994-1995, les
ressources financi&#232;res du CFTC ont
&#233;t&#233; de l'ordre de 23,6 millions de
livres Sterling (30 millions d'&#233;cu).
<p>
<H3>Le d&#233;veloppement des ressources
humaines
</H3><p>
     Pr&#232;s du tiers du budget du Fonds est
affect&#233; au d&#233;veloppement des
ressources humaines en vue de rehausser les
qualifications au travers d'ateliers de formation,
de visites d'&#233;tude et de stages individuels.
<p>
     Quatre mille bourses ont &#233;t&#233;
octroy&#233;es au cours de la p&#233;riode
1993-1995 aux fins de l'am&#233;lioration des
aptitudes techniques. Elles ont &#233;t&#233;
attribu&#233;es &#224; des cadres moyens et
sup&#233;rieurs ayant des responsabilit&#233;s
techniques et administratives qui ont eu
l'occasion d'&#233;tudier dans les meilleurs
&#233;tablissements &#233;ducatifs du
Commonwealth ou d'effectuer des stages
professionnels (la formation se d&#233;roule
&#224; 63 % dans des pays moins
d&#233;velopp&#233;s).
<p>
     Le Fonds permet &#233;galement &#224;
des universit&#233;s ou autres
&#233;tablissements de devenir des centres
d'excellence et de valoriser leur enseignement
par la nomination d'experts acad&#233;miques et
techniques. En 1993-1995, par exemple, il a
aid&#233; cinq universit&#233;s d'Afrique et des
Cara&iuml;bes &#224; dispenser des cours du
2&#232;me cycle en collaboration avec d'autres
universit&#233;s du Commonwealth.
<p>
     Etant donn&#233; que le CFTC ne parvient
g&#233;n&#233;ralement &#224; r&#233;pondre
qu'&#224; 60 % des demandes de formation
sp&#233;cialis&#233;e qui lui sont
adress&#233;es, ses programmes sont
organis&#233;s &#224; l'&#233;chelon
r&#233;gional ou de l'ensemble du
Commonwealth afin d'en optimiser l'impact, en
particulier lorsqu'il s'agit de th&#232;mes tels que
la r&#233;forme administrative, la gestion
financi&#232;re et la planification
strat&#233;gique.
<p>
     Les priorit&#233;s du Fonds en mati&#232;re
de formation s'&#233;tablissent comme suit:
<ul>
<li>premi&#232;rement, identifier les besoins
(des consultants sont envoy&#233;s dans les
pays demandeurs afin d'analyser leurs plans de
d&#233;veloppement et de les aider &#224;
&#233;tablir leurs propres priorit&#233;s en
mati&#232;re de formation) ;
<p>
<li>proposer des programmes d'&#233;ducation
et de formation dans les domaines qui
refl&#232;tent le mieux les pr&#233;occupations
du CFTC : la bonne gestion des r&#233;formes
&#233;conomiques et financi&#232;res par les
gouvernements, le d&#233;veloppement durable,
la participation des femmes et l'application des
technologies ;
<p>
<li>offrir un programme int&#233;gr&#233; de
consultance, de conseils et de formation afin
d'aider les hauts fonctionnaires ainsi que la
direction des entreprises publiques et
priv&#233;es &#224; coordonner et g&#233;rer
les r&#233;formes et la restructuration ;
<p>
<li>organiser des ateliers et s&#233;minaires de
politique r&#233;unissant des hauts
fonctionnaires de l'Etat, des cadres
sup&#233;rieurs et des personnalit&#233;s
acad&#233;miques des pays du Commonwealth
afin de partager leurs exp&#233;riences sur
certains points, d'avoir connaissance d'exemples
de bonnes pratiques, d'analyser les
probl&#232;mes et de r&#233;fl&#233;chir aux
difficult&#233;s nouvelles ;
<p>
<li>encourager les &#233;tablissements &#224;
proposer de nouveaux programmes
d'&#233;ducation et de formation
sp&#233;cialis&#233;es ;
<p>
<li>proposer une formation technique et
professionnelle dans le cadre du Commonwealth
Industrial Training and Experience Programme
(les ateliers organis&#233;s de 1993 &#224;
1995 ont port&#233; sur la r&#233;paration de
mat&#233;riel hospitalier, la r&#233;paration et
l'entretien dans le secteur des chemins de fer, et
la fabrication assist&#233;e par ordinateur) ;
<p>
<li>la mise en place de programmes &#224;
l'intention des femmes avec un accent particulier
sur les chefs d'entreprise et les responsables de
communaut&#233;s (le CFTC a notamment
aid&#233; trois universit&#233;s africaines
&#224; d&#233;velopper des programmes
sp&#233;cifiquement ax&#233;s sur l'esprit
d'entreprise des femmes dans les secteurs non
traditionnels) ;
<p>
<li>coordonner la mise en r&#233;seau de toute
une s&#233;rie de sp&#233;cialistes afin de
faciliter les &#233;changes d'information et la
diffusion d'exemples de bonnes pratiques (le
CFTC a r&#233;cemment soutenu la
cr&#233;ation de la Commonwealth Association
for Public Administration & Management
destin&#233;e &#224; am&#233;liorer la
performance des services publics et &#224;
rehausser les normes &#233;thiques).
</ul><p>
<H3>Des experts toujours &#224; disposition</H3>
<p>
     La p&#233;nurie de qualications est l'un des
principaux obstacles auxquels se heurtent les
pays cherchant &#224; relever le niveau de vie
de leurs citoyens. Aussi le d&#233;tachement
d'experts repr&#233;sente-t-il un tiers environ du
budget du CFTC.
<p>
     Par le caract&#232;re relativement
limit&#233; et soigneusement cibl&#233; de son
assistance, le CFTC &#233;vite le gaspillage
inh&#233;rent aux projets &#224; grande
&#233;chelle et &#224; une mauvaise
planification technique. Au cours de la
p&#233;riode 1993-1995, le co&ucirc;t d'un
expert-type &#224; long terme et d'un projet
moyen a &#233;t&#233; de l'ordre de
&#163;50.000 (62.000 &#233;cu) par an. Les
experts peuvent &ecirc;tre sur place dans les
trois &#224; quatre semaines qui suivent
l'approbation du projet.
<p>
     Pendant cette m&ecirc;me p&#233;riode, plus
de 200 experts ont effectu&#233; des missions
&#224; long et moyen terme dans 43 pays en
d&#233;veloppement du Commonwealth, 6
territoires d&#233;pendants et 18 organisations
r&#233;gionales. Les sp&#233;cialit&#233;s
demand&#233;es sont extr&ecirc;mement
vari&#233;es puisqu'elles vont de l'hydrographie
et l'agro-foresterie au tourisme en passant par
les affaires juridiques, la sant&#233;,
l'organisation sociale et l'informatique.
<p>
     La mission des experts &#224; court terme
peut durer de quelques jours &#224; six mois. Ils
ont un r&ocirc;le consultatif et aident les
gouvernements &#224; mettre en place de
nouveaux syst&#232;mes ou de nouvelles
technologies. Les experts &#224; long terme
restent sur place de six mois &#224; deux ans, et
certains m&ecirc;mes pendant quatre ans. Ils
participent &#224; l'&#233;laboration et la mise
en oeuvre de politiques, ou assurent les
capacit&#233;s de gestion ainsi que la formation
du personnel homologue appel&#233; &#224; les
remplacer en temps voulu. Certains experts
&#224; long terme sont des formateurs dans des
domaines sp&#233;cialis&#233;s.
<p>
     Le CFTC tient &#224; d&#233;signer des
experts f&#233;minins : celles-ci ont
repr&#233;sent&#233; 13 % des effectifs
envoy&#233;s sur le terrain entre 1993 et 1995.
On a compt&#233; parmi elles une consultante
anesth&#233;siste au Ghana, une
&#233;conomiste agricole au Mozambique, une
sp&#233;cialiste de l'information &#224; la
Barbade, une responsable de la promotion de la
p&ecirc;che en Papouasie-Nouvelle Guin&#233;e
et une juriste sp&#233;cialis&#233;e dans les
questions d'environnement aux Seychelles.
<p>
     Un programme permettant &#224; des
volontaires suffisamment qualifi&#233;s et
exp&#233;riment&#233;s de se pr&#233;senter
comme experts pour des missions de courte
dur&#233;e (3 mois maximum) a &#233;t&#233;
lanc&#233; vers le milieu de 1995. Il s'appuie sur
des experts du Commonwealth d&#233;sireux
d'offrir leurs services &#224; titre
b&#233;n&#233;vole aux pays en
d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
<H3>Priorit&#233; aux chefs d'entreprise</H3>
<p>
     Soucieux de venir en aide aux petites
entreprises, le CFTC axe ses efforts sur ceux qui
les g&#232;rent et sur la recherche de nouveaux
talents. L'assistance va essentiellement aux
petits pays, en particulier dans le Pacifique. Le
programme se d&#233;roule en trois phases :
premi&#232;rement, des "&#233;tudes
d'opportunit&#233;" visant &#224; l'identification
des chefs d'entreprise valables, des
possibilit&#233;s d'investissement, du potentiel
d'expansion et des probl&#232;mes particuliers ;
deuxi&#232;mement, "les s&#233;minaires sur le
d&#233;veloppement de l'esprit d'entreprise" qui
aident les propri&#233;taires et exploitants
d'entreprises &#224; penser de mani&#232;re
plus cr&#233;ative, &#224; &ecirc;tre plus
attentifs aux opportunit&#233;s qui se
pr&#233;sentent, et &#224; agir de mani&#232;re
strat&#233;gique lorsqu'ils envisagent une
expansion ; et, troisi&#232;mement, les "cliniques
d'entreprise" offrant des conseils
personnalis&#233;s au chef d'entreprise sur le
lieu m&ecirc;me de son exploitation. L'utilit&#233;
de ce soutien individualis&#233; a &#233;t&#233;
d&#233;montr&#233;e : les chefs d'entreprise
deviennent plus rentables et plus
comp&#233;titifs et s'adaptent d&#232;s lors aux
&#233;volutions de l'&#233;conomie mondiale.
<p>
<H3>Le d&#233;veloppement des exportations</H3>
<p>
     C'est au CFTC que revient l'initiative des
programmes Contact-Promotion et des
rencontres entre acheteurs et vendeurs (Buyer-
Seller Meets) en vue de venir en aide aux petits
exportateurs. Ces forums permettent aux
d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s de
soci&#233;t&#233;s g&#233;n&#233;ralement
situ&#233;es dans de petits pays du
Commonwealth de pr&#233;senter leurs produits
et de rencontrer d'&#233;ventuels acheteurs
d'autres pays. Les consultants du CFTC
programment ces activit&#233;s bien &#224;
l'avance en &#233;tablissant une s&#233;lection
de fabricants susceptibles d'avoir un
succ&#232;s commercial, en d&#233;terminant
les march&#233;s &#233;trangers
&#233;ventuellement int&#233;ress&#233;s et en
apportant des conseils pour l'am&#233;lioration
de la conception de certains produits. Une
formation est parfois organis&#233;e &#224;
l'intention des exportateurs et du personnel des
usines.
<p>
     Le CFTC finance un programme
sp&#233;cial de d&#233;veloppement des
exportations destin&#233; aux chefs d'entreprise
f&#233;minins. Ce programme comprend des
&#233;tudes nationales approfondies concernant
les femmes exer&#231;ant leur activit&#233;
dans l'exportation et la promotion des ventes
&#224; l'&#233;tranger. Des &#233;tudes de ce
type ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;cemment
effectu&#233;es &#224; Chypre, au Sri Lanka et
en Zambie.
<p>
     Le programme aide les femmes &#224;
adapter leur artisanat &#224; l'exportation,
&#224; am&#233;liorer leurs techniques de
fabrication et &#224; entreprendre des missions
commerciales &#224; l'&#233;tranger. Une
formation leur est &#233;galement
propos&#233;e en mati&#232;re de marketing
des exportations, de d&#233;veloppement-
produit, de calcul des co&ucirc;ts et de
tarification. Une r&#233;orientation de la politique
officielle est parfois recommand&#233;e. On
estime que l'aide apport&#233;e aux femmes
ghan&#233;ennes en 1994 pour l'expansion des
d&#233;bouch&#233;s commerciaux de leurs
vanneries et autres produits artisanaux a permis
de g&#233;n&#233;rer des ventes d'une valeur
de 3,1 millions US$.

<h4>Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>le Courrier ACP-UE</i><br>no. 158,

<b>
Le Prince Claus des Pays-Bas, dont l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
pour les questions de d&eacute;veloppement est notoire, avait
&eacute;t&eacute; l'invit&eacute; d'honneur lors de l'inauguration
du Centre technique de coop&eacute;ration agricole et rurale (CTA)
&agrave; Ede, il y a onze ans. Il &eacute;tait &agrave; nouveau
pr&eacute;sent pour l'ouverture officielle des nouveaux locaux
du CTA &agrave; Wageningen, municipalit&eacute; toute proche dans
la province de Gueldre. Ce choix est d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;
: la ville de Wageningen est traditionnellement un centre europ&eacute;en
majeur de recherche agricole et, par ailleurs, l'engagement des
Hollandais en mati&egrave;re de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement
n'est plus &agrave; d&eacute;montrer.</B> 
<P>
Si le si&egrave;ge du CTA ne s'est pas fortement &eacute;loign&eacute;
de son point de d&eacute;part en termes g&eacute;ographiques,
les 39 membres de son personnel n'en sont pas moins conscients
de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'aller beaucoup plus loin dans
leur mission s'ils veulent continuer d'assumer leur r&ocirc;le
d'information agricole. Le Directeur du CTA, <I>Dr R.D. Cooke</I>,
a insist&eacute; sur ce point dans l'allocution prononc&eacute;e
lors de la c&eacute;r&eacute;monie d'ouverture. Rappelant les
t&acirc;ches principales du Centre (voir encadr&eacute;), le Dr
Cooke a soulign&eacute; l'&eacute;volution des situations et des
d&eacute;fis &agrave; g&eacute;rer, et il a illustr&eacute; son
propos en &eacute;voquant quatre aspects sp&eacute;cifiques.

<P>
Le premier concerne le changement majeur qui intervient au
niveau des syst&egrave;mes agricoles nationaux, l'Etat se retirant
toujours davantage en faveur du secteur priv&eacute; et des ONG.
Cette &eacute;volution s'accompagne d'une tendance &agrave; la
d&eacute;centralisation, ce qui multiplie les partenaires potentiels
avec lesquels le CTA doit collaborer et aux besoins desquels il
doit r&eacute;pondre. 
<P>
La lib&eacute;ralisation mondiale a eu, elle aussi, certaines
r&eacute;percussions sur le type d'information recherch&eacute;e
par les &quot;clients&quot; du CTA. La demande a longtemps - et
quasiment exclusivement - &eacute;t&eacute; ax&eacute;e sur les
informations scientifiques et techniques dans la perspective d'une
augmentation de la productivit&eacute;. Cet aspect reste important,
affirme le Dr Cooke, mais on note un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t croissant
&agrave; l'&eacute;gard des questions de marketing. 
<P>
Le Directeur n'a gu&egrave;re surpris en &eacute;voquant le
d&eacute;fi que constituent les nouvelles technologies telles
que la mise en r&eacute;seau &eacute;lectronique et la m&eacute;morisation
num&eacute;rique. Tout le probl&egrave;me consiste &agrave; adapter
ces techniques aux besoins et aux r&eacute;alit&eacute;s des ACP.
&quot;Au si&egrave;cle prochain, ajoute-t-il, c'est l'acc&egrave;s
&agrave; l'information qui fera la diff&eacute;rence entre les
riches et les pauvres&quot;. 
<P>
Le Dr Cooke a cl&ocirc;tur&eacute; son expos&eacute; en &eacute;voquant
l'importance croissante des liens r&eacute;gionaux. Il a signal&eacute;
&agrave; ce propos que le CTA recherchait les moyens d'aider ses
partenaires &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration de programmes de d&eacute;veloppement
r&eacute;gional. 
<P>
La d&eacute;claration marquant l'inauguration officielle des
locaux avait &eacute;t&eacute; faite lors de l'allocution pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente,
prononc&eacute;e par <I>E.F.C. Niehe</I>, Directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
adjoint pour la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne au Minist&egrave;re
n&eacute;erlandais des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res. M. Niehe
a soulign&eacute; le r&ocirc;le d&eacute;terminant du CTA, pr&eacute;cisant
que m&ecirc;me si la situation alimentaire mondiale s'&eacute;tait
am&eacute;lior&eacute;e, &quot;nous sommes au seuil d'une ins&eacute;curit&eacute;
alimentaire structurelle&quot;. Il a &eacute;galement parl&eacute;
en termes plus g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration
ACP-UE : il reconna&icirc;t que &quot;le partenariat, la souverainet&eacute;
et l'&eacute;galit&eacute; ont &eacute;t&eacute; quelque peu n&eacute;glig&eacute;s&quot;
par les donateurs mais signale un &quot;retour&quot; de ces concepts.

<P>

Mamba</I>, co-pr&eacute;sident du Comit&eacute; des Ambassadeurs,
a parl&eacute; des p&eacute;nuries alimentaires en Afrique subsaharienne
et pr&eacute;cis&eacute; un certain nombre de difficult&eacute;s
rencontr&eacute;es par les producteurs africains, notamment en
mati&egrave;re de technologies nouvelles et de marketing. Il a
&eacute;galement &eacute;voqu&eacute; les d&eacute;fis environnementaux
que doivent relever les pays ACP des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique.
Il a cependant tenu &agrave; souligner que la situation n'&eacute;tait
pas &quot;totalement n&eacute;gative&quot;. Ainsi, par exemple,
les m&eacute;thodes et technologies nouvelles ont eu des effets
positifs sur la culture des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales au Zimbabwe,
sur l'horticulture au Kenya, et sur la production de cacao et
de caf&eacute; en Afrique occidentale. M. Mamba a fait &eacute;cho
aux d&eacute;clarations du Dr Cooke quant aux avantages des march&eacute;s
r&eacute;gionaux, et a termin&eacute; par un engagement ferme
de soutenir la poursuite de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE. &quot;L'histoire
montrera que la Convention de Lom&eacute; a donn&eacute; une impulsion
essentielle au d&eacute;veloppement&quot;, a-t-il conclu.

<P>
Le dernier orateur a &eacute;t&eacute; <I>Steffen Smidt</I>,
Directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral pour le D&eacute;veloppement &agrave;
la Commission europ&eacute;enne, qui a soulign&eacute; le r&ocirc;le
pionnier jou&eacute; par le CTA en d&eacute;veloppant une approche
sectorielle &agrave; une &eacute;poque o&ugrave; la coop&eacute;ration
au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;tait essentiellement ax&eacute;e
sur des projets individuels. &quot;Le Centre, a-t-il d&eacute;clar&eacute;,
est devenu une institution internationale de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence
en mati&egrave;re d'information agricole&quot;. Le Directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
a insist&eacute; sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; pour les pays
ACP de d&eacute;velopper leurs propres capacit&eacute;s, dont
la limitation actuelle explique l'&eacute;cart &quot;entre le
potentiel et la r&eacute;alit&eacute;&quot;. Le Centre pourrait,
&agrave; son avis, contribuer &agrave; supprimer ce d&eacute;calage.
M. Smidt est &eacute;galement revenu sur un aspect d&eacute;j&agrave;
&eacute;voqu&eacute;, &agrave; savoir que le flux d'information
ne doit pas &ecirc;tre &agrave; sens unique: &quot;l'information
du Sud vers le Nord est indispensable &agrave; un meilleur ciblage
des futurs programmes&quot;, affirme-t-il. 
<P>
A l'issue des expos&eacute;s, les invit&eacute;s ont eu l'occasion
de se familiariser davantage avec les activit&eacute;s du Centre
en s'entretenant avec des membres du personnel. Une exposition
illustrant la nature et les objectifs du Centre &eacute;tait pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e
dans les espaces publics du nouveau si&egrave;ge.

<HR>
<I>L'aide internationale contribue souvent &agrave; renforcer
le centralisme de l'Etat. La d&eacute;centralisation des pouvoirs
de d&eacute;cision et des finances publiques est pourtant indispensable
au succ&egrave;s des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement.</I>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Beno&icirc;t Vergriette :</B> Depuis la fin des ann&eacute;es
1970, la grande id&eacute;e de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
est de permettre aux pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires d'assurer
leur s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire. Manifestement, cette
orientation ne s'est pas concr&eacute;tis&eacute;e. Comment expliquez-vous
cet &eacute;chec ?
<P>
<B>Ad Oomen :</B> Dans le pass&eacute;, le syst&egrave;me d'aide
&eacute;tait trop centralisateur. Il reposait exclusivement sur
les relations entre gouvernements. En m&ecirc;me temps, les axes
d'intervention de la politique alimentaire &eacute;taient trop
complexes pour les bailleurs de fonds, qui se satisfaisaient d'une
pr&eacute;sentation sch&eacute;matique. Les donateurs connaissent
mal la situation des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et leurs
ambassades sont incapables de tout g&eacute;rer. Il n'y a gu&egrave;re
qu'au Mali que la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire se soit un
peu am&eacute;lior&eacute;e, peut-&ecirc;tre justement parce que
ce pays n'&eacute;tait pas important aux yeux des bailleurs...
De plus, pour chaque intervenant (institution, &Eacute;tat, responsable
de programme), les n&eacute;gociations mettent en jeu des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
particuliers qui vont influencer sa vision du probl&egrave;me.
On parle ainsi du syndrome de la farine de bl&eacute; ; chaque
donateur pr&ocirc;ne l'utilisation de sa propre farine.
<P>
Aujourd'hui, l'exc&egrave;s de centralisme peut &ecirc;tre &eacute;vit&eacute;.
Les organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) sont davantage impliqu&eacute;es
dans l'action des pays en d&eacute;veloppement (PED), les discussions
sur la question alimentaire se sont ouvertes &agrave; de nouveaux
participants.
<P>
<B>B. Vergriette : </B>Si l'on prend le cas des pays concern&eacute;s
par la Convention de Lom&eacute;, il est clair que ces &Eacute;tats
comme les membres de la Communaut&eacute; europ&eacute;enne (CE)
rechignaient &agrave; s'engager dans une v&eacute;ritable concertation
sur la strat&eacute;gie alimentaire. De leur c&ocirc;t&eacute;,
les pays ACP (Afrique-Cara&iuml;bes-Pacifique) craignaient d'avoir
&agrave; composer avec ce moloch qu'est la CE, ils n'&eacute;taient
pas du tout pr&eacute;par&eacute;s &agrave; des discussions. Le
pr&eacute;sident zambien Kaunda a ainsi court-circuit&eacute;
la strat&eacute;gie d&eacute;fendue par les Europ&eacute;ens ;
au moment m&ecirc;me o&ugrave; une &eacute;quipe d'experts arrivait
en Zambie pour analyser la situation alimentaire, il lan&ccedil;ait
sa propre politique, qui accordait la priorit&eacute; &agrave;
l'agriculture &eacute;tatique pour les productions vivri&egrave;res
en implantant de vastes fermes d'&Eacute;tat. Ce n'est que bien
plus tard que la Banque mondiale s'est trouv&eacute;e en position
de contraindre le gouvernement &agrave; revoir sa position. Au
Kenya, en revanche, la CE a pu mettre en route une &eacute;tude
alimentaire en 1984. Mais d&egrave;s que les experts ont commenc&eacute;
&agrave; mettre en cause la responsabilit&eacute; du pouvoir pr&eacute;sidentiel
dans la mauvaise gestion de l'agriculture, le gouvernement kenyan
a annonc&eacute; qu'il affrontait une grave s&eacute;cheresse
et un lourd d&eacute;ficit alimentaire. Chacun s'est senti mal
&agrave; l'aise. L'aide alimentaire est arriv&eacute;e et toute
discipline a disparu. Mais les discussions se d&eacute;roulent
diff&eacute;remment aujourd'hui. Au lieu d'une organisation centralisatrice,
on mobilise tous les acteurs sur diff&eacute;rents terrains et
on guette ce qu'il va en sortir. On maintient un dialogue avec
les gouvernements des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, mais en
m&ecirc;me temps on organise &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de ces
pays toute une s&eacute;rie de <I>fora .</I> 
<P>
<B>A. Oomen : </B>L&agrave; intervient le principe de la subsidiarit&eacute;.
Ce n'est pas &agrave; la Coop&eacute;ration fran&ccedil;aise d'instituer
des corps interm&eacute;diaires en Afrique pour contourner l'&Eacute;tat.
C'est aux producteurs, aux responsables r&eacute;gionaux, etc.
de se regrouper et de discuter avec leurs homologues en Europe.
<P>
<B>B. Vergriette : </B>N'est-ce pas un principe un peu formel
? En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, pour que cette coop&eacute;ration
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e fonctionne, il faudrait que les agriculteurs,
fran&ccedil;ais par exemple, aient de r&eacute;els int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
communs avec des producteurs ou des consommateurs d'un pays en
d&eacute;veloppement. Cette nouvelle fa&ccedil;on de concevoir
l'aide publique est tr&egrave;s pertinente, parce qu'elle s'attache
au point de vue des acteurs et s'interroge sur les relations de
pouvoir. Mais sous l'angle institutionnel, cette conception pose
de s&eacute;rieuses difficult&eacute;s. Pour assurer une m&eacute;diation
et renforcer les institutions, les bailleurs vont appuyer certaines
r&egrave;gles sociales plut&ocirc;t que d'autres. Ils vont intervenir
dans la question du droit de propri&eacute;t&eacute; et des droits
d'usage, qui sont tout de m&ecirc;me au centre du ciment social.
Est-ce bien le r&ocirc;le de l'aide publique ? C'est en tout cas
s'ing&eacute;rer infiniment plus qu'en construisant des routes
ou des barrages.
<P>
<B>A. Oomen : </B>Mais la subsidiarit&eacute; est un moyen d'obtenir
plus d'efficacit&eacute;. Elle am&eacute;liorerait certainement
la qualit&eacute; du syst&egrave;me de cr&eacute;dit, par exemple.
Si les &eacute;tablissements financiers du Nord g&eacute;raient
directement l'aide financi&egrave;re, cela permettrait de cr&eacute;er
une v&eacute;ritable discipline financi&egrave;re dans les populations
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, alors que souvent les gens ne se
sentent pas tenus de rembourser l'argent pr&ecirc;t&eacute; par
l'&Eacute;tat. Les agriculteurs consid&egrave;rent comme un d&ucirc;
les fonds pr&ecirc;t&eacute;s par les caisses nationales de cr&eacute;dit
agricole, parce qu'ils se sentent constamment flou&eacute;s par
le gouvernement.
<P>
<B>B. Vergriette : </B>A mon avis, le probl&egrave;me ne tient
pas tant &agrave; l'origine publique ou priv&eacute;e des cr&eacute;dits
qu'aux proc&eacute;dures de contr&ocirc;le. La subsidiarit&eacute;
est bien un d&eacute;bat sur les proc&eacute;dures. Pour l'instant,
le contr&ocirc;le s'exerce surtout <I>a priori</I>, au moment
du choix de l'interm&eacute;diaire entre le minist&egrave;re de
la Coop&eacute;ration et le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, et non
<I>a posteriori</I>, sur le terrain, sur le groupement d'agriculteurs
qui re&ccedil;oit le cr&eacute;dit. Il est normal que les &Eacute;tats
soient responsables de la mise en oeuvre des l&eacute;gislations,
mais si l'administration veut tout contr&ocirc;ler d&egrave;s
le d&eacute;part, elle ne trouvera jamais un terrain d'entente
avec les paysans.
<P>
<B>A. Oomen :</B> Pour en revenir &agrave; la question des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
communs : l'environnement institutionnel, qui recouvre le droit
foncier, la protection de la propri&eacute;t&eacute;, la l&eacute;gislation
sur la production, la transformation, la commercialisation, l'importation
et l'exportation, constitue bien un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun
&agrave; tous les acteurs. Or, pour le moment, dans les pays en
d&eacute;veloppement, les d&eacute;cisions politiques sur ces
th&egrave;mes ne sont pas prises ni appliqu&eacute;es par un v&eacute;ritable
&Eacute;tat de droit. Dans ces conditions, l'environnement institutionnel
se r&eacute;v&egrave;le avant tout une contrainte pour les acteurs.
Assurer le fonctionnement d'un syst&egrave;me politique ouvert
est donc une priorit&eacute;.
<P>
<B>B. Vergriette : </B>C'est d'autant plus complexe que le droit
national doit pouvoir s'adapter aux conditions locales. Il faudrait
des &eacute;chelons interm&eacute;diaires entre le local et le
national.
<P>
<B>A. Oomen :</B> Pour parvenir &agrave; ce degr&eacute; de d&eacute;centralisation,
le consentement des minist&egrave;res est n&eacute;cessaire. On
retrouve bien l'id&eacute;e de subsidiarit&eacute; : si les choses
fonctionnent &agrave; un certain niveau, les responsables de l'&eacute;chelon
administratif sup&eacute;rieur n'ont pas besoin d'intervenir.
La d&eacute;centralisation conduit ainsi &agrave; la subsidiarit&eacute;.
La question est de savoir ce qui est plus pratique, du centralisme
ou de la subsidiarit&eacute;.
<P>
<B>B. Vergriette : </B>Mais le pr&eacute;alable &agrave; la subsidiarit&eacute;
est tout de m&ecirc;me la transparence. Aucune discussion sur
la nature de l'environnement institutionnel ne peut aboutir tant
qu'elle ne peut s'appuyer sur des informations fiables. Les producteurs
locaux, par exemple, ne s'organisent pas pour demander aux instituts
de recherche de leur expliquer leurs travaux, parce que chacun
voile ses propres int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts. C'est le r&egrave;gne
de l'opacit&eacute;.
<P>
<B>A. Oomen. :</B> Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Pour qu'il y ait
transparence, il faut que les march&eacute;s fonctionnent librement.
Le manque de transparence, la mauvaise circulation de l'information,
sont justement la cons&eacute;quence de rapports de force in&eacute;gaux.
On ne peut donc pas poser la transparence comme pr&eacute;alable
&agrave; la subsidiarit&eacute;, alors qu'en r&eacute;alit&eacute;
c'est en modifiant les relations de pouvoir que l'on instaurera
davantage de transparence.
<P>
<B>B. Vergriette : </B>Pourtant, si l'on r&eacute;unit tous les
chefs de village d'une r&eacute;gion donn&eacute;e, les dirigeants
des organismes de vente de c&eacute;r&eacute;ales, les responsables
des banques c&eacute;r&eacute;ali&egrave;res plus tous ceux qui
repr&eacute;sentent un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t collectif pour qu'ils
discutent des actions qu'ils peuvent et ne peuvent pas mener dans
la domaine de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire, je suis certain
que le r&eacute;sultat sera positif. La population prendra conscience
d'avoir am&eacute;lior&eacute; sa s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire
gr&acirc;ce aux banques de c&eacute;r&eacute;ales. Il existe un
r&eacute;el manque de concertation &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires de l'aide, mais je crois
qu'une telle dynamique de discussion pourrait facilement s'instaurer.
Le probl&egrave;me est que les gouvernements ont davantage int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
&agrave; discuter avec les &Eacute;tats donateurs et les institutions
internationales qu'&agrave; mettre en place un dialogue national.
L'offre d'aide polarise leur attention sur l'ext&eacute;rieur.
<P>
<B>A. Oomen : </B>C'est vrai, les responsables des PED n'ont aucun
int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; formuler d'abord leur propre strat&eacute;gie
alimentaire et &agrave; demander ensuite &agrave; leurs interlocuteurs
internationaux si ils sont d'accord pour la financer.
<P>
<B>Michel Griffon :</B> Seule la d&eacute;mocratisation de la
discussion et de l'information peut changer ces pratiques. Au
Nord comme au Sud, les citoyens contribuables doivent &ecirc;tre
au courant de ce que deviennent leurs imp&ocirc;ts. Ils sont les
seuls &agrave; avoir des raisons d'exercer des pressions. Pourquoi
les repr&eacute;sentants de l'&Eacute;tat changeraient-ils leur
fa&ccedil;on de faire ? Ce n'est pas de leur argent qu'il s'agit.
Ils savent parfaitement que rendre publics les modes d'attribution
de l'aide aurait pour cons&eacute;quences d'&eacute;viter les
double emplois, de r&eacute;duire le volume d'activit&eacute;s
de la coop&eacute;ration et les masses financi&egrave;res dont
ils font en partie un usage personnel...
<P>
<B>A. Oomen :</B> Je crois que la concertation entre diff&eacute;rents
acteurs ne peut marcher que s'il existe une question commune &agrave;
r&eacute;gler. Encore faut-il que le co&ucirc;t de l'organisation
de la discussion collective soit inf&eacute;rieur au gain attendu.
L'aide a peut-&ecirc;tre l&agrave; un r&ocirc;le important &agrave;
jouer, un r&ocirc;le de levier pour l'action collective. Sur la
question du d&eacute;tournement de l'aide, par exemple, comment
faire en sorte que supprimer les abus devienne un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
collectif ?
<P>
<B>B. Vergriette : </B>Le probl&egrave;me est que les gains de
l'action collective ne se r&eacute;v&egrave;lent qu'&agrave; long
terme, tandis que les individus sont motiv&eacute;s par des objectifs
de court terme. Imaginons qu'un village malien mette en place
une banque de c&eacute;r&eacute;ales ; si le village voisin peut
recevoir gratuitement cinquante tonnes de c&eacute;r&eacute;ales,
il les acceptera m&ecirc;me au risque de provoquer l'&eacute;chec
du projet de banque. Chacun opte ainsi pour le risque minimum.
<P>
<B>M. Griffon :</B> Ces risques tiennent essentiellement au mauvais
fonctionnement des march&eacute;s. Qu'il s'agisse des march&eacute;s
c&eacute;r&eacute;aliers, des march&eacute;s du b&eacute;tail
ou des march&eacute;s financiers, les co&ucirc;ts de transaction
sont tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;s. Le transport et l'utilisation
d'&eacute;nergie sont on&eacute;reux, l'acc&egrave;s &agrave;
l'information est difficile, l'&eacute;laboration et la surveillance
d'un contrat de commerce sont co&ucirc;teuses, le carcan de la
hi&eacute;rarchie impose de payer des droits suppl&eacute;mentaires,
etc. Le seul moyen de lutter contre ces rigidit&eacute;s est d'am&eacute;liorer
l'efficacit&eacute; des march&eacute;s locaux. Les infrastructures
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t local devraient &ecirc;tre financ&eacute;es
par la collectivit&eacute; locale. Mais cela n'est possible que
si la d&eacute;centralisation des pouvoirs de d&eacute;cision
et de gestion s'accompagne d'une d&eacute;centralisation des ressources
fiscales. L'&Eacute;tat est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement d'accord
pour d&eacute;l&eacute;guer la gestion de ses probl&egrave;mes,
mais pas celle de ses ressources ! L'autonomie financi&egrave;re
des communes ou des r&eacute;gions est en effet tr&egrave;s r&eacute;duite.
La r&egrave;gle qui pr&eacute;vaut est celle de l'unicit&eacute;
budg&eacute;taire et les collectivit&eacute;s locales des PED
repr&eacute;sentent &agrave; peine 3 &agrave; 5 % des ressources
budg&eacute;taires totales. En outre, en raison de la pauvret&eacute;
de la population, l'&Eacute;tat central lui-m&ecirc;me ne dispose
pas d'un v&eacute;ritable pouvoir de pr&eacute;l&egrave;vement
fiscal et de redistribution. Il est donc indispensable de d&eacute;terminer
quelle est la meilleure gestion possible des finances publiques.
<P>
<B>A. Oomen :</B> On contr&ocirc;le mieux les d&eacute;rapages
budg&eacute;taires lorsque la gestion des imp&ocirc;ts se fait
localement. Et si la population peut voir &agrave; quoi sert l'argent
des imp&ocirc;ts locaux, elle a davantage confiance en l'&Eacute;tat.
<P>
<B>M. Griffon :</B> D'accord, mais par ailleurs la d&eacute;centralisation
fiscale se heurterait &agrave; la r&eacute;sistance des appareils
d'&Eacute;tat. Voyez par exemple la r&eacute;action du pr&eacute;fet
d'une collectivit&eacute; du Niger &agrave; qui j'ai demand&eacute;
son avis sur l'id&eacute;e d'allouer directement les investissements
publics aux collectivit&eacute;s locales ; il m'a r&eacute;pondu
que les repr&eacute;sentants de l'&Eacute;tat tirent en grande
partie leur l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; de l'argent qu'ils distribuent
localement et qu'ils lutteront pour conserver le contr&ocirc;le
de ces ressources. L'aide ext&eacute;rieure peut-elle intervenir
dans ce d&eacute;bat ?
<P>
<B>A. Oomen :</B> Je crois que les donateurs disposent de deux
moyens d'action. Ils peuvent soit conditionner leur aide &agrave;
la d&eacute;centralisation des finances publiques et &agrave;
l'am&eacute;nagement du territoire, soit allouer directement des
lignes de cr&eacute;dit aux collectivit&eacute;s locales, de fa&ccedil;on
&agrave; encourager la population &agrave; investir dans des projets
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t local.
<P>
<B>M. Griffon :</B> De fa&ccedil;on paradoxale, peut-&ecirc;tre
que le retrait des donateurs acc&eacute;l&eacute;rerait la d&eacute;centralisation
fiscale. Sans aide ext&eacute;rieure, la stabilit&eacute; et la
l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; des &Eacute;tats africains se d&eacute;graderaient
et les repr&eacute;sentants de l'&Eacute;tat seraient amen&eacute;s
&agrave; n&eacute;gocier de nouvelles relations de pouvoir avec
les collectivit&eacute;s et les populations locales. Or, la r&eacute;forme
de la fiscalit&eacute; est certainement l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment
cl&eacute; de la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; du secteur public africain.

<p>
This was the subject of a <a href="../../ecdpm/lome/conf_gb.htm">conference which took place in Maastricht from 12-14
June</a>, under the auspices of the European Centre for Development Policy Manage-
ment (ECDPM). It brought together participants from ACP countries and Europe,
including representatives of civil society (NGOs, the private sector, etc.). Four
major topics were addressed:
<p>
<h3>How can a new EU/ACP commercial relationship be constructed?</h3>
<p>
     There was agreement that some form of preferential trade regime should
continue after 2000. Some participants stressed the need to promote 'fair trade',
which would contribute not only to growth but also to development. The impact of
individual trade preferences is not always clear-cut, but obviously there cannot be
a single solution covering all problems in all ACP countries. An analysis of
negative constraints demonstrated the difficulties involved in reconciling the rules
of the Lom&#233; Convention and those of the World Trade Organisation.
<p>
<h3>How can the private sector become involved in development?</h3>
<p>
     The most important aspect of this topic is knowing how to create a
favourable and business-friendly environment which will enable the private sector
to play its part - and the role the European Union could play in this process. The
private sector was defined as both formal and informal, encompassing large,
medium and small enterprises, whether local or foreign. The importance of a
strong local private sector in guaranteeing long-term stability was particularly
emphasised. In this respect, the view was expressed that the role of the state and
its relationship with the European Commission should be redefined. There was
also a call for time to be set aside time for effective dialogue, and to create the
space for a partnership between the public and private sectors. It was felt that the
role of Economic and Social Councils should be expanded and specified more
clearly. As for the specific issue of privatisation, the point was made that this
should not be seen as a panacea and that it should be approached on a country-
by-country basis.
<p>
     As regards current instruments, it was noted that their objective is
essentially to meet public-sector requirements. The role of the Centre for the
Development of Industry (CDI) attracted some criticism. Speakers felt that the
private sector should be more involved in the preparation and implementation of
cooperation programmes with the European Community. Direct financial support to
the private sector was seen as desirable, including backing from the European
Investment Bank.
<p>
<h3>What partnership?</h3>
<p>
     The partnership concept was seen to have been eroded over the past two
decades, with the pretext of efficiency resulting in a more paternalistic approach.
Mechanisms needed to be found to enable EU priorities and the prerogatives of
ACP countries to be reconciled. Reference was made to the political nature of the
origin of the partnership and the need to find a new political raison d'&ecirc;tre for
this type of relationship. The problems of cohesion within the ACP group and its
relations with the EU were also raised, and there was a discussion about the
possibility of giving the Convention a regional character - although a number of
speakers expressed reservations about this.
<p>
     On the European side, two lacunae emerged, namely coordination between
donors, and consistency between Lom&#233; and other Community policies
(including relationships with the Bretton Woods institutions).
<p>
     In addition to the principle of partnership, some participants were keen to
stress the motives of solidarity and common interest that lay behind cooperation. It
was not simply a matter of 'negative' interdependence. The appropriateness of the
term 'partnership' was questioned, if this was only to mean financial and technical
cooperation. The politicisation of Lom&#233; appears to be on the agenda,
involving a move from the current partnership to a genuine 'contractual approach'
through political dialogue.
<p>
     As for the role of partnership in cooperation policy management, it is felt
essential that civil society and the private sector be involved. There was also a
discussion of the debt problem.
<p>
<h3>How can financial and technical cooperation be improved?</h3>
<p>
     As usual, reference was made to the need to simplify and differentiate
management of Lom&#233; Convention instruments, particularly in the context of
the programming process. As regards the role of non-state actors, a cautious
approach was recommended. Finally, new instruments were called for to prevent
conflict.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
     This conference, coming after several others of the same type, was
characterised essentially by private sector and NGO calls for greater participation
in Community cooperation policy. Moreover, the need for 'politicisation' of the
Lom&#233; policy, shifting from purely financial and technical aid to a genuine
cooperation contract, seems to have attracted the support of all participants.
These questions are sure to figure in the 'Green Paper' on 'Lom&#233; after
2000', which the European Commission plans to publish before the end of 1996.

<h2>Non-Governmental Organisations and Development Education: Natural Allies?</h2>
<p>
<i><b>Colm Regan</b>, head of education at Trocaire in Ireland, examines the relationship between NGDOs and Development Education, the tensions and opportunities that arise and ways forward to make this 'natural alliance' more fruitful.</i>
<hr>
Much of the early history of Development Education is synonymous with the history of the Non Governmental Development Organisation (NGDO) movement itself. Many of the earliest initiatives in the area of Development Education grew directly from the overseas programmes of various NGDOs. These initiatives often sought to inform supporters at home of the need for, and results of, their financial support; to explain the economic and political contexts of the NGDO work in the developing world and/or highlight many of the most serious denials of human rights which underdevelopment fostered. The central pivot of this focus was usually the NGDO itself or the broader context of its work. This focus sought to generate increased charity donations based on a variety of impulses, depending on the roots and nature of the individual organisations involved.
<p>
In more recent years, the situation has changed somewhat. While many NGDOs still view Development Education in similar ways to those described above (and unfortunately, too many NGDOs still ignore Development Education altogether), a second generation of NGDOs have sought to broaden the scope, methodology and intent of their work. For them, education and advocacy work has assumed greater importance usually linked to a greater appreciation of the need to address the structural nature of inequality and injustice and to highlight and challenge dominant economic and political structures. In this they have also been encouraged by progressive NGDOs from the developing world who have highlighted the imperative of building from charity into solidarity.
<p>
This latter context has generated an approach in Development Education far less concerned with the overseas work of NGDOs per se, but with how this highlights and illustrates the systematic nature of inequality, the growing nature of interdependence based on this inequality and the implications of this interdependence for the 'North', as much for the 'South'. There has also been an increased focus on development and human rights issues in the 'North' (on this see Korten (1990), chapter 10).
<p>
Despite all of this, Development Education remains a minority concern, overly limited to the voluntary sector and seen as peripheral to mainstream educational initiatives in both the formal and non-formal sectors. In this context a number of important questions suggest themselves for those concerned with extending Development Education beyond the 'development ghetto'. Are the NGDOs the central base upon which to build Development Education? Is their approach too limiting and limited? Are the models they use to promote Development Education based on the same approach here, as they claim to use overseas? Are there now new actors on the Development Education scene and how do we relate to them? Has the time come for Development Education to move out from the NGDO ghetto and embrace a wider and more representative public and are the NGDOs willing to and capable of supporting such a move?
<p>
Before proceeding to discuss some of these questions, an important qualification is necessary. There now exists many NGOs whose core concern is Development Education and advocacy in the 'North'. Between them they embrace the full range of development, environment, peace, justice and human rights issues. However, many of these NGOs still depend for support and funding on a limited number of larger NGOs. The questions listed above essentially relate to the larger NGOs, although they also have relevance for all involved.
<p>
<h4>Limitations for the NGDO Approach</h4>
Many recent commentators and analysts have identified the arguments for increased focus on the NGDO Development Education and advocacy work, amongst them Minear (1987), Lemaresquier (1988), Korten (1990), Clark (1992), Dolan (1992) and Siglin (1994). Many international organisations have also recently highlighted the growing need for enhanced education and advocacy work including UNDP (1992), the OECD and the Bread for the World Institute (1994). Such commentators and institutions argue that the evidence of growing poverty and an ever widening gap between the rich and the poor demand a policy response which goes significantly beyond development co-operation alone. They assert that NGDOs have a key role in addressing the international mechanisms which fuel and maintain inequality (albeit that their analyses arise from significantly diverging viewpoints).
<p>
Minear (1987), for example, traces some of the more recent initiatives in Development Education and advocacy work amongst NGOs in the United States and concludes:
"...despite the importance attached by the international community to education and advocacy, US NGOs are not moving with despatch (in these areas)...Ó (p.209)
Doug Siglin, writing Hunger 1994 (Fourth Annual Report on the State of World Hunger), outlines many of the pressures increasing on voluntary agencies to do more advocacy and education work around the important issue of hunger, and yet he concludes:
<p>
"Many US NGOs presently choose not to be particularly active in advocating changes in US policy which could assist reducing or eliminating international hunger and poverty" (p.30).
<p>
There is little doubt that the same arguments can be made about NGDOs in Europe where Development Education and advocacy work remain cinderella areas, significantly under-resourced and underdeveloped. Many NGDOs do not appear to shy away from calling for change in public attitudes and policies, but they appear reluctant to commit significant amounts of their own resources to creating the climate for change. This situation would seem to stand in stark contrast to the rhetoric of the NGDOs themselves and the evidence on the grounds that increased education and action in the 'North' is urgent (on this see Regan 1994). Understanding why this is so may help us appreciate the need to broaden the base of Development Education beyond NGDOs alone.
<p>
Minear (1987) identifies some of the constraints under which NGDOs operate and which influence their actions in the areas of education and advocacy. He cites the demands of their supporters for direct, personal action;  reluctance to 'divert' 
resources into education and advocacy; the complexity of issues; the relationship between the NGDOs and government, and fear of the political dimension. To this list of largely 'external' factors must be added a number of 'internal' constraints. 
<p>
The very nature of NGDOs pivots on the overseas agenda and this tends to dominate, often at the expense of the domestic agenda. Another issue is the opening tension between fundraising (from either the public or from governments and multilaterals) and education/advocacy. This is not a simple equation but is one which significantly mediates the degree to which NGDOs are prepared to be critical. NGDOs often highlight the degree to which their overseas partners shape and animate their programme, yet this principle does not appear to apply with their domestic partners. There is an inevitable tension between involving domestic partners, structures and supporters who may have different agendas or whose appreciation of the issues may not be identical with that of the NGDO. There is also an argument to be made that Development Education agendas have often been poorly planned, have sometimes been self-indulgent and have not, therefore, given the necessary lead and vision required.
<p>
There are also a number of important 'technical' constraints on NGDOs which influence their actions. Writing in an entirely different context (that of agricultural work of NGDOs in the developing world), Farrington, et al., comment:
<p>
"Aside from the idealistic overstatements of their strengths, there are structural limits on what NGOs can achieve when acting alone: limits on their technological capabilities, their impacts on poverty and their capacity to be legitimate, and accurate, representatives of the concerns of the rural poor.Ó
<p>
This is as true for the domestic agenda of NGDOs as it is for their overseas agenda.
<p>
<h4>The Changing Domestic Context</h4>
The constraints identified above place real limitations on the degree to which NGDOs are a sufficient base for education and advocacy work. This is by no means to argue for a more limited NGDO involvement as the perspectives and agendas NGDOs bring are crucial to the health of these areas and the possibilities they create for effective links with poor and marginalised groups in the 'South' are central. Such links cannot be as effectively established by official programmes. However, recent significant changes in the domestic context have created many new possibilities which augur well for the future of development education if they can be built upon.
<p>
Growing awareness of the nature of interdependence and of the possibilities and problems it creates has encouraged the emergence of a range of new actors in Development Education. In Ireland this includes the trade union movement at collective and individual levels, the women's movement (through an organisation entitled Banulacht), the National Youth Council of Ireland (through its Development Education for Youth (DEFY) programme) and a multiplicity of local, community-based programmes (see Cremin and Regan, eds., 1994). At the level of formal education, there have been a series of 'official' programmes which have explicitly recognised the importance and value of Development Education. Again, these programmes have involved the emergence of new, and the strengthening of, older actors outside the NGDO sector. While many NGDOs have been instrumental in the emergence of such programmes they have by no means been solely responsible for them (nor should they be). Church, state, the media and a host of groups and individuals from a wide variety of sectors and motivations have all played their respective roles. This situation is mirrored at a variety of levels throughout the rest of Europe. Such developments create a fundamentally different and ultimately more sustainable base upon which to build for the future.
<p>
There is considerable evidence of continuing goodwill and empathy amongst large segments of the public toward the poor of the world. This is most evident in sustained high levels of support for the work of NGDOs. It is also evidenced in public opinion polls which constantly place high value on tackling problems of poverty and development. There is also evidence that young people see justice issues (both at home and abroad) as high on their agenda (see Dillon and Wegimont, 1994). If such expressions of goodwill and interest have not yet become organised into systematic campaigns, this is, in part, due to the weakness of the NGDO movement itself.
<p>
Finally, in recent years we have witnessed the emergence of a host of NGOs concerned with environmental, human rights, immigration and gender issues. Many of them have been successful in placing their concerns and agendas before the public. Many of them have also appreciated the importance of committing resources to education. The emergence of these groups and their targetting of many of the same sectors as the development NGOs, creates the need for the possibilities of new broader alliances.
<p>
<h4>Some Implications for the NGDO Movement</h4>
The need for Development Education has never been greater or more urgent and the argument for increased NGDO commitment to it more necessary. NGDOs need to constantly recognise and plan for a proper rounded approach to development work in the context and realities of the 1990s and beyond. This clearly implies bringing the development debate back home in every sense. But the changing domestic agenda means that the role of NGDOs in Development Education will have to change. One of the most important changes involves the recognition and acceptance of the fact that NGDOs no longer own (or control) the development agenda and that this is a positive development. There are now many other groups of teachers, students, trade unionists and churchgoers who are actively involved, many of them with their own structures.
<p>
It is in the interest of the NGDO movement to support these groups and to encourage the development of their own agendas. It is also in the interests of the NGDO movement to service the needs and agendas of these groups, otherwise the NGDOs will be bypassed by them. In short, the time has come for the building of strategic alliances between the NGDO movement and various more representative structures within civil society. The benefits of such alliances are incalculable. A corollary of such a move is the need for NGDOs to be clear about the precise nature of their movement and their agendas (and limitations) which it might bring to such alliances. Such alliances will need to be very practical and work-orientated at every level and not nominal, as has been the case in the past.
<p>
There are many additional implications of this scenario for NGDOs, but space precludes discussing them here (many of them are discussed in Cremin and Regan, eds., 1994). However, two further comments need to be noted. NGDOs desire greater domestic recognition and support but seem to be reluctant to invest time and resources to earn it. The price of realising the potential of the domestic development and justice agenda could seriously increase and sustain NGDO resourcing, not just in financial terms. NGDOs will need to involve domestic partners in their work in a more structured and participative manner. In summary, their attitudes towards their domestic supporters will have to change. Admittedly in a different context, Korten comments on this:
<p>
"In authentic development an assisting agency is a participant in a development process that is community driven, community led and community owned - basic conditions of sustainability.Ó (1990, p.219)
<p>
While Korten is commenting on overseas work, the implication of his comment is just as relevant domestically.
<p>
Secondly, in building effective domestic partnerships, NGDOs will have to recognise the legitimate needs and agendas of domestic structures be they school students, church communities or trade union groups. There needs to be a fuller recognition of the need to integrate the international and domestic agendas than before. Such an integration will have major implications for the dominance of the overseas agenda. Such an integration of agendas may also change the very nature of many NGDOs in a positive sense. 
<p>
There are also many implications for development educationalists in such an approach but these require lengthy debate and discussion which is not possible here. Suffice to note that much of the practice of development educationalists must also change, especially in the degree to which the needs and agendas of local structures and groups really animate and shape our strategies.
<p>
In a very real sense Development Education and the NGDO movement should be natural allies but this alliance cannot simply be assumed - it must be carefully and systematically built. The developmental, educational, moral and practical arguments for increased NGDO commitment to Development Education and advocacy work are compelling. Both our overseas and domestic partners are demanding this of us and the need to re-establish the global development agenda in its rightful place, is a great political challenge for us all.

<p>
<B>There were no real surprises or unexpected developments at the ACP-EU
Council meeting which took place in Apia, Western Samoa, on 27 and 28
June, 1996. The session was preceded by an ACP Council, which saw the
adoption of three important decisions. The first of these was the
appointment of a new ACP Secretary-General, Mr Ng'andu P. Magande of
Zambia. The post had been vacant for some time, following deadlock within
the ACP Group over a successor to Berhane Ghebray. The ministers also
agreed to hold a summit of ACP heads of government in Libreville, Gabon,
during the second half of 1997. This meeting is expected to focus heavily on
the future of ACP-EU relations once the present Lom&#233; Convention has
expired.</b>
<p>
In the substantive area, the ACP Council adopted a resolution deploring the
suspension of cooperation with Equatorial Guinea. Ministers urged the European
Union to make use of the procedure in Article 366a of the revised Lom&#233;
Convention, and to set in train the consultation procedure envisaged in this
provision.
<p>
This issue was raised again by the ACP side at the subsequent ACP-EU Council.
This meeting, which was presided over by Mrs Toya (Italian Under-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs) and Mr Syamujaye (Zambia's Trade Minister) had a relatively light
agenda. There was a discussion about the Commission proposal for a directive on
the use of vegetable fats, other than cocoa fat, in chocolate (see issue 158 of The
Courier, p.35). Somalia also featured in the debate, with representatives agreeing
on the need to find ways of allowing this country to benefit from Lom&#233;
Convention provisions. The civil conflict in Somalia, and the absence of an
effective central administration have prevented the deployment of regular
development aid for many years, although significant amounts of emergency
assistance have been and are still being provided.
<p>
In addition, the ACP-EU Council approved two reports drawn up by the
development finance cooperation sub-committee and commodities sub-committee
respectively. Representatives were able to reach a compromise on two
outstanding points of contention in the resolution on development finance relating
to tenders and the dissemination of the user's guide.
<p>
Note was taken of the number of countries that have so far lodged instruments of
ratification for the revised Lom&#233; Convention (Mauritius agreement). At the
time of the Apia meeting, only nine countries had ratified: seven on the ACP side
(Barbados, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Jamaica, Malawi, Mauritius and Solomon
Islands) and two EU Member States (Denmark and Sweden). Appeals were made
for the contracting parties to speed up their ratification procedures so  that the
Eighth European Development Fund can come on stream as speedily as possible.
<p>
The next ACP-EU Council meeting will take place in Luxembourg on 24 and 25
April 1997.
<p>
The government of Western Samoa deserves a special mention for the warmth of
their hospitality and the efficient way in which they organised the Council meeting.
Delegates from all sides were keen to express their appreciation of the host
country's efforts, which ensured the smooth running of the various meetings and
gave the visitors a real taste of this Pacific country's unique culture.

Les strat&#233;gies de d&#233;veloppement de l'apr&#232;s-

ind&#233;pendance ont attribu&#233; &#224; l'Etat un r&#244;le

directeur dans la gestion du d&#233;veloppement, souvent au

d&#233;triment d'autres acteurs de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Ceci a

conduit le secteur public &#224; se d&#233;velopper bien au-

del&#224; de ses possibilit&#233;s financi&#232;res et de gestion. Au cours des ann&#233;es 1980, un

consensus global est apparu quant aux limites de l'impact de

l'action du secteur public pour favoriser la croissance et le

d&#233;veloppement. La nouvelle doctrine n&#233;olib&#233;rale met

l'accent sur l'ajustement, la d&#233;r&#233;glementation et la

privatisation. C'est plus particuli&#232;rement en Afrique sub-

saharienne, que l'on s'en est pris &#224; la mainmise de l'Etat sur

le d&#233;veloppement. Les programmes d'ajustement structurel ont

remis en cause le monopole du pouvoir dont disposait l'Etat, et

l'Etat africain, autrefois unique r&#233;cipiendaire et partenaire

de l'aide internationale, a perdu son statut d'organe le plus favoris&#233. Ces changements ont permis aux autres acteurs du d&#233;veloppement d'occuper la

place ainsi lib&#233;r&#233;e et ont contribu&#233; &#224; l'acheminement vers le processus de d&#233;mocratisation. Simultan&#233;ment, le concept de "bonne gouvernance" est devenu le dernier terme en vogue.

<p>

Ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, la progression g&#233;n&#233;rale de cette nouvelle orthodoxie du

d&#233;veloppement s'est vue contest&#233;e. On peut d&#233;gager quatre raisons principales

&#224; l'origine de ce ph&#233;nom&#232;ne. Premi&#232;rement, se contenter de "faire reculer

l'Etat" s'est r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; ne pas &#234;tre la panac&#233;e. Les politiques mises en place

pour r&#233;duire la taille et les cots de l'administration, par exemple, ont caus&#233; une diminution

dramatique des niveaux des salaires, &#224; un tel point que le secteur public n'a plus &#233;t&#233;

en mesure d'attirer ou de retenir la main-d'oeuvre qualifi&#233;e. Par cons&#233;quent, les

capacit&#233;s ont souvent diminu&#233; jusqu'&#224; atteindre des niveaux dangereusement faibles.

<p>

Deuxi&#232;mement, le d&#233;bat "Etat contre march&#233;", qui n'est pas nouveau, a perdu de son

int&#233;r&#234;t. La privatisation immod&#233;r&#233;e et le d&#233;mant&#232;lement de l'Etat

ont &#233;t&#233; perus comme &#233;tant tout autant des erreurs que l'engagement sans

r&#233;serve en faveur d'une organisation bureaucratique et centraliste qui avait

pr&#233;c&#233;d&#233. L'exp&#233;rience en Asie de l'Est met en

lumi&#232;re le r&#244;le d&#233;terminant d'un gouvernement fort et efficace, et on

estime qu'un syst&#232;me d'administration publique africain "offensif" requiert un r&#244;le et un domaine d'intervention bien d&#233;finis ainsi que l'aptitude &#224; d&#233;terminer les degr&#233;s optimaux de son engagement.

<p>

Troisi&#232;mement, la recherche indique que les liens entre la d&#233;mocratisation et le

d&#233;veloppement demeurent accidentels. Les pays en voie de

d&#233;veloppement qui ont r&#233;ussi &#224; d&#233;clencher la croissance et &#224; r&#233;duire

la pauvret&#233; sont g&#233;n&#233;ralement ceux dont les politiques ont rassembl&#233;

suffisamment de pouvoir, de probit&#233;, d'autonomie et de comp&#233;tence pour &#233;laborer,

poursuivre et encourager la r&#233;alisation d'objectifs de d&#233;veloppement explicites et

d&#233;termin&#233;s au niveau national.

<p>

Quatri&#232;mement, les limites des acteurs de "la soci&#233;t&#233; civile" en tant qu'agents du

d&#233;veloppement sont de plus en plus reconnues. En g&#233;n&#233;ral, les acteurs de la

soci&#233;t&#233; civile, y compris les ONG, sont encore tr&#232;s faibles en ce qui concerne

l'organisation et des doutes ont &#233;t&#233; &#233;mis quant &#224; leur capacit&#233; de produire

des effets significatifs sur les r&#233;formes des politiques. Dans de nombreux cas, la distinction entre

Etat et soci&#233;t&#233; civile n'est pas &#233;vidente, et certains sont conscients du fait que

d'innombrables organisations de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile, op&#233;rant en dehors des cadres des

politiques nationales, obtiendront peu de r&#233;sultats en termes de traitement des probl&#232;mes de

d&#233;veloppement de l'Afrique.

<p>

Bien que les partisans d'un Etat bureaucratique fortement centralis&#233; soit tr&#232;s peu nombreux,

on est peut-&#234;tre all&#233; trop loin dans la r&#233;duction du domaine d'action du secteur public.

L'important, aujourd'hui, est d'assurer la transition d'un r&#244;le o&#249; [les gouvernements]

dominaient le processus des politiques de d&#233;veloppement &#224; un r&#244;le o&#249; ils

fournissent un environnement favorable aux divers acteurs institutionnels relativement autonomes.

<p>

Ce document fournit un exemple concret d'un processus de transition de ce type dans la gestion des

ressources de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. La coop&#233;ration

d&#233;centralis&#233;e fut l'une des innovations de la quatri&#232;me Convention de Lom&#233;

sign&#233;e en 1989 entre l'Union europ&#233;enne (UE) et 69 Etats ACP (Afrique, Cara&#239;bes

et Pacifique). Elle permet &#224; un grand nombre d'acteurs du d&#233;veloppement de

b&#233;n&#233;ficier des ressources de Lom&#233;, ce qui, par le pass&#233;, &#233;tait l'apanage

des agences des gouvernements centraux. Cette innovation refl&#233;tait les conceptions en

&#233;volution (des donateurs) quant &#224; la relation Etat-soci&#233;t&#233; et aux modalit&#233;s

de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Cependant la mise en pratique de ce concept s'est

r&#233;v&#233;l&#233;e difficile et les r&#233;sultats de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement

obtenus jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent dans le cadre de Lom&#233; IV sont maigres.

<a name="abs"><hr><h3>Abstract</h3></a>

<p>

Post-independence strategies gave the state a lead role in managing development, often excluding other

actors. During the 1980s, this centralist, top-down approach was challenged. Structural adjustment

and democratisation processes created space for direct involvement of civil society actors. Institutional

pluralism, participatory development and decentralisation became the new buzzwords. Against this

background, the European Union (EU) introduced the concept of "decentralised cooperation" into the

Lom&#233; IV Convention. It allows a wide variety of partners outside central government to use

Lom&#233; resources, which in the past were the monopoly of central government agencies. NGO's

in particular, moved to the forefront as the 'third institutional sector' along with the state and business.

<p>

This new approach to aid delivery has great potential. Direct support to civil society actors may bring

development closer to the people, enhance local ownership and accountability. Actively involving local

actors is often seen to be the best investment in "capacity development."

<p>

Progress in implementation, however, has been limited. There are strong political, bureaucratic and

cultural resistances to decentralised cooperation. Neither central government, nor donors have much

experience in working with civil society actors as equal partners  -- rather than simply as beneficiaries

or executing agencies. It is not clear what decentralised cooperation actually means and what makes

it so different from traditional approaches. Implementation is hampered by a lack of appropriate

dialogue structures (interfaces) and flexible procedures. The different actors involved still need to

clarify their new roles in decentralised cooperation and to adapt their capacities accordingly.

<p>

Using the experience of the EU under the Lom&#233; Convention, this paper introduces the concept

of decentralised cooperation, its origin and constituent elements; it identifies some of the key factors

that have hampered effective implementation; it summarises the main changes emerging from the

recent mid-term review of the Lom&#233; Convention. The final chapter draws some broader

conclusions on how to improve the implementation of decentralised cooperation.

<p>



<a name="con"><h3>THE CONCEPT OF DECENTRALISED COOPERATION</h3></a>

<p>

Decentralised cooperation was one of the innovations of the fourth Lom&#233; Convention signed in

1989 between the European Union (EU) and the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries. It

paved the way for economic, social and cultural organizations (other than central bureaucracies) to

submit development projects and to obtain Lom&#233; funding. 

<p>

This innovation reflected the worldwide thrust towards political liberalisation, changing perceptions

on the role of the state in development and a search for alternative channels of aid delivery. It was

seen as a step towards greater involvement of the people directly concerned by development

programmes and a tool for the creation of a democratic fabric. It also sought to promote the active

involvement of the European civil society in development (i.e. North South partnerships between local

authorities, private sector associations, trade unions, etc.).

<p>

Several factors led to the adoption of decentralised cooperation in Lom&#233; IV:

<p>

<ul>

<li>Political changes.  The worldwide thrust towards political liberalisation of the 1980s challenged

      the state's monopoly on power and gave a boost to civil society. New conditionalities have

      emerged that link aid provision to the type and quality of government [Moore, 1993]. This,

      in turn, led to a renewed interest for decentralisation as a possible response to the financial

      crisis and lack of efficiency of the state apparatus [M'Bassi, 1995, Manor, 1995].

<p>

<li>Shifting views on the role of the state  Chambers [1993] distinguishes three clusters of views.

      The neo-Fabian ideology of the 1970s gave the state a major direct role in development. The

      neo-liberal model was a creature of the 1980s. In recent years, a new paradigm has evolved,

      based on "putting people before things, and poor people first; development through a learning

      process rather than by blueprint; decentralisation, democracy and diversity to value local

      knowledge; participation and small group and community action; and open and effective

      communication and access." Decentralised cooperation proposes a practical application of this

      paradigm. In this new approach, the role of central government is no longer to dominate the

      development policy process, but to provide an enabling environment for a variety of relatively

      autonomous institutional actors" [Oluwu, 1992].

      

<li>Concern to get value for money.  The need to enhance aid effectiveness led donor agencies to

      move away from exclusive partnerships with African bureaucracies, generally perceived to

      be "overdeveloped and unaccountable" [Fowler, 1991; see also Dia, 1993] and to embrace

      non-state actors as alternative channels of aid delivery. Decentralised cooperation was seen

      to offer major benefits. It would make it possible to reach out directly to the "primary actors"

      of development; to prevent a monopolistic and non-transparent use of resources and to build

      local capacity. 

</ul>

<p>



<a name="old"><h3>OLD WINE IN NEW BOTTLES?</h3></a>

<p>

To what extent is decentralisation cooperation really a "new" approach, and how different is it from

traditional modes of operation?

<p>

There are no easy answers to this question. Participation and decentralisation have been on the

development agenda for quite some time. There is a long-standing tradition of cooperation with local

NGO's and to a lesser extent, with local authorities. Furthermore, decentralised cooperation means

different things to different people. Some see it as a merely another financing line for NGO's. Others

argue that decentralised cooperation is about twinning or partnerships between decentralised public

authorities (as in the French system). Others, including Commission officials, claim that the purpose

of decentralised cooperation is not to finance a multitude of isolated projects, but to promote

cooperation between different actors at local level. Field managers find it difficult to see the difference

with the micro-projects scheme, introduced under Lom&#233; I (1975-1980).

<p>

The problem is compounded by the very open-ended nature of decentralised cooperation, as promoted

under the Convention. The Commission has always been reluctant to come up with clear principles,

eligibility criteria and procedures, for decentralised cooperation. This was done partly to avoid conflict

with the ACP states, partly to prevent rigidity in management. It was felt that new rules and

regulations would reduce the scope for innovation, flexibility and country specific approaches.

<p>

Yet careful reading of official reports and statements, makes it possible to identify some distinctive

basic features of decentralised cooperation programmes:

<p>

<ul>

<li>Political agenda. Decentralised cooperation is not so much a new instrument as a different

      political approach to development cooperation. There are clear linkages with the idea of

      "participatory development" and the promotion of democracy and human rights;  strengthening

      the organs of civil society is expected to gradually broaden participation of non-state actors

      in policy-making, both at local and national levels; and direct funding to a wide variety of 

      associations may help to promote the formation of interest groups which can challenge

      monopolistic tendencies and poor state performance. 

<p>

<li>Transfer of decision-making and management responsibilities. The bottom-line of decentralised

      cooperation is to support initiatives that originate directly from the local communities and 

      associations. There is no longer room for top-down forms of participation, where

      "beneficiaries" or "target groups" are invited to implement development projects designed 

      elsewhere. Decentralised cooperation aims at reducing the number of "intermediaries" in 

      managing aid and to put an end to "la logique du d&#233;veloppeur". Responsibility for

      programme identification and implementation is delegated to the lowest possible level (the 

      principle of subsidiarity). The transfer of financial responsibilities to the local actors is seen

      as the cornerstone of decentralised cooperation. This is a major innovation within the

      Lom&#233; framework. Central government agencies will no longer be able to interfere in

      the day-to-day management of decentralised operations (including sensitive issues such as

      tenders). This has led some cynics to argue that decentralised cooperation is an elegant way

      to devolve or spread corruption more evenly.

<p>

<li>Capacity Development. In decentralised cooperation, this is seen as both a means and an end.

      It make little sense to transfer management responsibilities in the absence of targeted capacity

      development programmes that enable local actors to assume their new roles. On the other

      hand, involving local actors through a process of "learning by doing" is often the best

      investment in capacity development; it helps to strengthen the capacity of civil society to

      formulate their own development priorities; and it may contribute to building strong

      intermediate organisations that can "voice" the needs of the poor. 

<p>

<li>Linkage with national development policies. Decentralised cooperation does not mean opposition

      to government, but a search for complementarities. The purpose is not to shift support away

      from government to a myriad of local NGO's. The limits of the "go it alone" approach have

      been clearly evidenced in Mozambique where, in 1990, no less than 170 foreign NGO's were

      running programmes in complete isolation from the State -- in many cases, these "new

      missionaries" had divided the country into "mini-kingdoms" [Hanlon, 1991]. Decentralised

      cooperation under Lom&#233; attempts to avoid these pitfalls. It emphasises cooperation

      rather than antagonism between central government and local actors. It wants to give a

      prominent role to local governments as a nexus between the central agencies, the donor

      community and the local actors (NGO's included).

<p>

<li>Different roles for northern partners. Decentralised cooperation is not another financing line for

      cooperation between northern associations (e.g. NGO's) and their southern counterparts. In

      contrast with the traditional NGO co-financing modalities, decentralised cooperation aims to

      directly fund a variety of local organisations. Alliance with a northern partner is still possible,

      but no longer a prerequisite to access funds. It is hoped that this will induce northern NGO's

      to reduce their heavy involvement in project execution and to take up other roles (e.g.

      capacity development of local partners, assistance in managing direct funding, lobbying and

      advocacy).

</ul>

<p>



<h3><a name="#dec">DECENTRALISED COOPERATION IN PRACTICE</h3></a>

<p>

A recent survey by the Commission, based on questionnaires completed by the Delegations, indicates

that most decentralised cooperation programmes are still experimental in nature. In several ACP

countries, political conditions are increasingly favourable to decentralised cooperation. This is

particularly the case for countries involved in decentralisation processes. Promising efforts are made

to disseminate information, to start a dialogue between state and civil society (e.g. Zimbabwe,

Senegal) and to set up decentralised aid programmes (in some cases in close collaboration with local

authorities).

<p>

On the whole, however, traditional approaches are still dominant. From the survey, it clearly appears

that most decentralised cooperation programmes are not so different from classical micro-projects. 

Local actors are seldom involved in project identification, appraisal and selection. Programme

management remains highly centralised. There is only limited delegation of financial authority. The

mobilisation of EU decentralised partners has not really materialised.

<p>

This slow pace of implementation ought not be surprising. Time is needed to change top-down

attitudes [Mukandala, 1992], to reduce levels of mutual mistrust and to agree upon new roles,

management approaches and procedures.  The main bottlenecks to effective implementation include: 

<p>



<i>Political, bureaucratic and cultural resistances in ACP states</i>

<p>

Decentralised cooperation runs contrary to the centralist state view of cooperation, which characterised

all previous Conventions. Old attitudes die hard. ACP State see little incentives to change this and to

make provision in their indicative programmes for decentralised cooperation. Many governments are

afraid to devolve responsibilities and thus to lose control over aid resources and related benefits. The

hostility towards decentralising part of the aid budgets mirrors resistance to any form of political

decentralisation. Research on the relation between African government and NGO's confirms this view:

"the amount of space allowed to NGO's in any given country is determined first and foremost by

political considerations, rather than by any calculation of the contribution of NGO's to social and

economic development" [Bratton, 1989]. The lack of clear operational guidance does not offer an

incentive for field managers to venture into decentralised cooperation. Furthermore, little progress will

be achieved if civil society actors continue to see the state as the "enemy" or to compete with each

other for donor funds and local popularity.  

<p>



<i>Conflicting views on the purpose of decentralised cooperation</i>

<p>

Decentralised cooperation meant different things to different people. ACP governments in favour of

the scheme tend to see it as a way to involve NGO's and other decentralised actors in the

implementation of Lom&#233; programmes. This reflects the fairly limited view that ACP states tend

to have on the role of decentralised actors. Local NGO's, for instance, are invited to participate in

the execution of poverty alleviation projects, aiming at mitigating the social cost of adjustment, not

to discuss the adjustment programmes themselves. This approach is consistent with the wider

decentralisation policies of most African states. The tendency for central governments has been to 

devolve its functions to the local level in order to improve implementation of projects -- to bring top-

down development closer to the people [Mutahaba, 1989]. Not surprisingly, this narrow interpretation

is questioned by decentralised actors. NGO's, for instance, increasingly want to be involved at the 

planning stage, when the country is setting its priorities. They reject the role of mere "subcontracting

agencies", i.e. cheap delivery systems for the implementation of development programmes decided

elsewhere. They argue that decentralised cooperation is not about funding, but access to joint decision-

making.

<p>



<i>Lack of adequate procedures</i>

<p>

The nature of the Lom&#233; Convention (a legal partnership agreement between the EU and ACP

governments) offers little scope for a truly decentralised approach. Lom&#233; IV procedures, for

instance, reserve a key role at each stage of the project cycle for the National Authorising Officer 

(NAO), the official ACP representative in charge of EU aid. This cumbersome decision-making and

management system is hard to reconcile with the autonomy of decentralised actors and bottom-up

participatory activities.  In addition to this, the new scheme was introduced without serious

consideration of its institutional and managerial implications. People in the field were left with no 

clear indications on how to set up and to operate decentralised cooperation programmes. Many critical

questions remain unanswered. What are the eligibility criteria and priority areas of intervention? How

are appropriate partners identified and selected? How to set up a dialogue with decentralised actors?

How is decentralised cooperation with prevailing EDF procedures? How to monitor this type of

programme? How to involve central government in decentralised cooperation and what new capacities

need to be developed, both in recipient countries and donor agencies to operate the new scheme? 

<p>



<i>Capacity problems</i>

<p>

The different actors involved are poorly equipped to use this chapter of the Convention. This certainly

holds true for civil society. Knowledge of the modalities of decentralised cooperation is extremely

low. In January 1994, the Liaison Committee of Development NGO's to the EU and MWENGO (a

Zimbabwe based NGO) organised a workshop on decentralised cooperation. Few of the African

NGO's attending the meeting had any knowledge of the Lom&#233; Convention. They find it difficult

to find their way to the Delegation and to comply with EDF procedures. In some countries,

governments and donor agencies are willing to decentralise, but they do not find a well structured and

representative civil society that has the capacity to enter into new partnerships. Lack of information

also prevents European decentralised actors from participating in the scheme. Central government

agencies, from their side, have little experience and capacity for dealing with a variety of autonomous

civil society actors. There are also capacity problems at the Commission side, particularly in the

country Delegations. Managing decentralised cooperation is a time-consuming task. It requires

specialist knowledge and skills, including with regard to participatory techniques, decentralised

management and monitoring systems. All of this is not readily available in the understaffed

Delegations. 

<p>



<h3><a name="#cha>CHANGES SINCE THE MID-TERM REVIEW</h3></a>

<p>

The mid-term review of Lom&#233; IV has recently been concluded and a new financial protocol 

agreed upon. The future Convention will have a new section on decentralised cooperation,

incorporating the main changes of the mid-term review of Lom&#233; (see new text in annex).

<p>

From the outset of the negotiations, the EU expressed a keen interest to expand the opportunities and

level of resources for this type of aid delivery. It was claimed that decentralised cooperation reflects

the primary objectives of EU development cooperation (i.e. the promotion of democracy, participatory

development and poverty alleviation).

<p>

The mandate of the EU seemed to concentrate on (i) creating space for upstream participation of

decentralised actors in defining the next National Indicative Programme (NIP); (ii) to expand the

funding opportunities for decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's, and (iii) to change the

rules for decision-making and management (i.e. to review the role of the NAO in allocating

Lom&#233; resources). 

<p>

This mandate has not fully materialised, partly as result of fierce opposition from ACP states against

the idea of direct funding. This led to the following compromise:

<p>

<ul>

<li>With a view of broadening participation in formulating future indicative programmes, a "Joint

      Declaration on the Consultation and Information of Agents of Development" was agreed upon.

      According to this Declaration, ACP States will endeavour to organize "exchanges of views"

      with decentralised actors and to provide "relevant information necessary for their participation

      in the implementation of the programmes." If needed, and resources are available, the

      Commission can provide financial support for this type of consultation and information

      exchange. Most decentralised actors, including the private sector, are likely to be dissatisfied

      with this timid attempt to democratize the policy dialogue on Lom&#233; programming.  

<p>

<li>Three funding modalities will be available in the new Convention. First, ACP states themselves

      can incorporate specific decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's. Second,

      decentralised actors can participate in the execution of government programmes included in

      the NIP. Third, and this is really new, ACP states can reserve a certain percentage of their

      NIP to finance a wide variety of decentralised activities, to be determined at a latter stage.

      The open-ended nature of this window may help to provide direct and flexible support to

      genuine local initiatives. The existence of such a specific "guichet" depends entirely on the

      goodwill of the ACP state involved. Here again, fierce defenders of decentralised cooperation

      might feel disappointed. They might have expected a stronger EU stance on this critical point,

      including the option of reducing the allocation of Lom&#233; resources to those countries

      failing to put aside money for decentralised cooperation. 

<p>

<li>The principles with regard to the role of national authorities have not been modified. ACP-EU

      cooperation support decentralised cooperation "within limits laid down by the ACP states

      concerned". This provision ought not be a problem in countries which are supportive of

      participation and decentralisation. It may help to ensure the necessary coherence between

      national development plans and local initiatives. But in countries facing poor governance

      conditions, it is a recipe for failure. It will make it very difficult to reach out to local

      populations and organisations. 

</ul>

<p>

recipient countries and donor agencies to operate the new scheme? 

<p>

<p>



<h3><a name="cha>CHANGES SINCE THE MID-TERM REVIEW</h3></a>

The mid-term review of Lom&#233; IV has recently been concluded and a new financial protocol 

agreed upon. The future Convention will have a new section on decentralised cooperation,

      of participation and decentralisation. It may help to ensure the necessary coherence

      between national development plans and local initiatives. But in countries facing poor

      governance conditions, it is a recipe for failure. It will make it very difficult to reach out

      to local populations and organisations. 

</ul>

<p>

<a name=imp><h3><hr>IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DECENTRALISED

COOPERATION</h3></a>

<p>

Overcoming current constraints to effective implementation will, inevitably, be a slow process.

Time is needed to move away from thirty years of centralised development cooperation. The way

forward lies with practice, experimentation, learning by doing, risk-taking and critical feedback.

This, in turn, may help to prevent donor-driven, blueprint approaches to decentralised cooperation.

<p>

In this final section, we draw broader conclusions on how to improve the implementation of

decentralised cooperation -- some of which is equally relevant to bilateral agencies and northern

NGO's.

<p>

<I>1. Adopt country-specific approaches</i>

Decentralised cooperation is not done in a vacuum. Progress is likely to be influenced, to a very

large extent, by the conditions prevailing in recipient countries. Each country will have to find its

own way to implement decentralised cooperation; there is no room for standardized packages.

Decentralised cooperation will be slow to materialise if the political and economic power remains

highly centralised and civil society very fragmented. No amount of donor pressure is likely to

rapidly change this. It is likely to gain momentum in countries that have a strong commitment to

political decentralisation and a booming civil society. In countries carrying out an ambitious

decentralisation policy, donor agencies and foreign NGO's will need to make some clear choices.

What is the most appropriate "entry point" (i.e. partner) for providing support to local initiatives?

How best to use the new opportunities created at district level? How to ensure coherence between

local programmes and government decentralisation programmes?

<p>

Recent research in Uganda, to which the author was associated, indicates that different options are

possible, each presenting strengths and weaknesses. Some donor agencies might prefer to fully

support the political decentralisation process of the Ugandan government. This may lead them to

provide (direct) financial and institutional support to district structures. The advantage of this

approach is that the donor programme works within existing structures. It starts from the premise

that district structures are there to stay (which is not the case with donor agencies and foreign

NGO's). Supporting the emergence of a strong local framework for development planning and

coordination may help to ensure domestic political and administrative accountability. Linking aid

programmes to existing structures provides better chances for sustainability. This option also

carries risks. Donor programmes can be trapped in local politics. The focus on official bodies

(politicians and civil servants) may make it difficult to reach out to the bottom level and to ensure

genuine participation. Other agencies (primarily northern NGO's) might decide to choose local

communities and groups as the main "entry point."  District authorities are not neglected but

perceived in a rather functional way (i.e. as a potential resource to be tapped to ensure project

implementation). This type of decentralised cooperation  may facilitate a truly participatory

approach and capacity-building of decentralised actors. But the problem here will be to 'scale up'

toward the district structures. District authorities (lacking basic facilities, resources and appropriate

salaries) are likely to resent parallel programmes, richly endowed with operational budgets,

vehicles, topping-up salaries. This, in turn, may threaten the sustainability of the programmes.

<p>

These contrasting experiences also point to the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to

supporting decentralisation. 

<p>



<I>2. Promote cooperation rather than competition </i>

Past development practice has been characterised by the paucity of institutional forms used to

achieve development objectives. After a period of almost exclusive cooperation with central

agencies, the danger is now to radically shift donor support to private actors (including NGO's).

<p>

This is not the best path to follow. Either-or approaches have no place in decentralised

cooperation: "Development from below requires development from above, using combinations of

hard and soft political power, tight and loose bureaucratic controls, and forms of centralisation and

decentralisation, Above all, without mutual respect among levels of government, there can be no

community empowerment" (Werlin, 1989]. 

<p>

Simply "rolling back the state" is no panacea. The long-running "state-versus-market" debate has

lost much of its poignancy. Indiscriminate privatization and dismantling of the state is "as much an

error as the earlier whole-cloth commitment to centralist-bureaucratic organization" [Wunsch,

1991; Boye, 1992]. Experience in East Asia highlights the critical role of a strong and efficient

government [Ranis, 1989]. Links between democratisation and development remain haphazard

[Healey, Ketley and Robinson, 1993; Ellis, 1995]. 

<p>

Developing countries that have been successful in pursuing growth and alleviating poverty are

generally those "whose politics have concentrated sufficient power, probity, autonomy and

competence at the centre to shape, pursue and encourage the achievement of explicit and

nationally-determined development objectives" [Leftwich, 1994]. Moreover, the limitations of

"civil society" actors as development agents, working outside national policy frameworks, are

increasingly recognised [Ukpong, 1993]. Often, the division between state and civil society is not

obvious [Mamdani, 1992]. Doubts have been raised as to their capacity to have significant impact

on political reform [Fowler, 1991].

<p>

The message is clear. The polemics of centralised versus decentralised systems ought to be

avoided. Government should not be put in a position that it feels threatened or at the losing end. It

would be unwise for donor agencies simply to circumvent central government and to distribute aid

resources randomly among a wide variety of decentralised actors. Both the relevance and

sustainability of this type of activities may depend, to a large extent, on a supportive role of

governments (e.g. financing of recurrent costs). Civil society institutions can complement the

action of the state, but not replace it:  "NGO's are not the answer when the state is weak [...].

NGO's should in fact strengthen the state by making it accountable to its own people by a process

of strengthening civil society. A strong civil society invariably leads to a strong state and the

opposite is true" [Chitega, 1994]. 

<p>

The challenge is rather to convince government that decentralised cooperation may help it to

achieve the objectives of its structural adjustment programme, to help generate income, provide

employment and offset the social cost of economic and institutional reform programmes [Laidler,

1994]. In a similar vein, it has been argued that "the rise in participation will be less threatening

to the states that are strong and more institutionalized" [Van de Walle, 1994].

<p>

If levels of mutual distrust can be reduced, there is scope to establish new partnership between

governments and decentralised actors [Farrington, 1993]. Donor agencies play a critical role in

promoting this type of complementary linkages by providing adequate financial incentives.

<p>



<I>3. Develop new institutional arrangements and procedures</i>

Decentralised cooperation cannot work in the absence of new institutional arrangements for

dialogue, decision-making and implementation. This will require institutional creativity and

innovation. A first priority is to develop both new "interfaces" (dialogue structures) between

central government and decentralised actors. In several countries, this will have to be done from

scratch. Thirty years of authoritarian rule have created a major gap between state and civil society,

resulting in distrust of officialdom. There is a lack of shared norms and institutions with sufficient

legitimacy so as to ensure adherence of civil society actors. A second priority is to put in place

appropriate decision-making and implementation structures for decentralised operations.

Management authority can, for instance, be delegated to "steering committees" (representing the

different stakeholders, including central governments and donors), independent trust funds or

private agencies. 

<p>

There is equally need for efficient funding procedures, allowing for a quick response to grassroots 

initiatives. Finally, there will be little political and managerial support to transfer responsibilities

(i.e. "to lose control") in the absence of efficient monitoring and evaluation systems. To the extent

possible, these monitoring systems should be locally embedded.

<p>



<I>4. Learn to work with local governments</i>

Empirical research in different regions of the developing world has demonstrated that a nonprofit

sector, funded by external donors, is not a valid alternative to a public sector with domestic

responsibility [Meyer, 1992; Batkin, 1992]. NGO's are not in a position to substitute for central

government provision of basic services, nor is it their role. Local governments, placed in between 

NGO's and the central government, may provide a more appropriate institutional framework.  

<p>

The climate seems ripe for increasing support to local governments. In many African countries,

central government agencies are "opening up", while civil society actors are making efforts to

"scale up".  The local government system may offer a platform for democratic interaction,

participation and the search for new partnerships between different actors. 

<p>

Aid agencies have not been very good in providing support to the emergence of a viable local

governance system. At best, they have provided some financial support, technical assistance and

training to local authorities. At worst, donor agencies have simply ignored their potential role in

development policy management. In recent years, new approaches have been advocated, including 

"short-term external assistance for recurrent financing" [Therkildsen and Semboja, 1992].  

<p>

Northern NGO's will also need to reconsider their policies. For too long a time, they have tended

to by-pass local authorities, and have often weakened the structures by recruiting their staff at

higher salaries. NGO's need to work both on the "demand side" (i.e. helpg communities to be

more productive and to demand better government services) but equally on the "supply side"  --

working with line ministries and other authorities at both the provincial and local level to ensure

that they have qualified manpower, funds and equipment to work effectively. Only in those few

countries facing complete economic and political collapse should NGO's try to take on these

functions themselves [Goyder, 1994].

<p>



<I>5. Decentralising the "mind" of donor agencies</i>

This is relatively easy at the policy level, as decentralisation has become a rallying cry among

donor agencies. Adopting a 'decentralised mind' is far more difficult at the managerial and

institutional level. It implies a profound change in donor attitudes, management, procedures and

organisation -- much alike the change central government agencies have to undergo. It will require

changes in programme design and implementation, technical cooperation policies, division of

responsibilities between field offices and headquarters and accountability systems. It may need a

revision of the current project cycle, to adapt it to the participatory framework of decentralised

cooperation. There is, for instance, no room for an army of external experts, called in to quickly

elaborate a detailed programme document or to play a dominant role in implementation. Another

critical issue is the accountability requirements. Pressures on donor agencies to justify the use of

aid funds may lead them to move accountability "upwards" (i.e. towards their own constituencies)

rather than "downwards" (i.e. towards local beneficiaries). This, in turn, may increase the

administrative burden on local organisations, having to elaborate an endless stream of accounts and

reports. A possible alternative is to make greater use of local accountability systems. Perhaps the

most difficult change will be to adapt the "language" of development cooperation to the real world

and values of decentralised actors. 

<p>



<I>6. Increase knowledge</i>

<ul>

Decentralisation and participation have become new fads among donor agencies. They are

promoted almost as a panacea for improving aid effectiveness. This is a risky approach:

<p>

<li>Both concepts make assumptions about state and civil society which are neither justified nor

      even properly examined [de Kadt, Mars and White, 1992). There is, for instance, no

      guarantee that local policy-making will be more relevant, participatory and development-

      oriented than a centralised approach [Crook, 1991]. The 'politics of the belly' ('la

      politique du ventre') may find a stronger expression at local level. The recent proliferation

      of local NGO's in Africa is a signal. Their levels of legitimacy, capacity and

      accountability are extremely varied.

  

<li>Problems of capacity are likely to be even more pronounced at local level. Donor agencies

      are well-advised not to over-estimate the capacity of civil society actors to quickly assume

      a lead role or to absorb large amounts of money. It will be important to systematically

      adapt financial flows to recipient implementation capacities. Intermediary NGO's can play

      a key role in providing a link between donor agencies and local groups [Carroll, 1992].

<p>

<li>Decentralised cooperation is a highly political form of aid. Most donor agencies seem poorly

      equipped to deal with this political dimension. At best, there is a tendency to see 'local

      politics' as a general contextual element. At worst, use is made of an idealised view of

      community participation and solidarity (e.g. the myth of 'spontaneous combustion' of

      people and ideas at grassroots level). Additional research will be needed on the role of

      foreign aid and its potential impact on the internal dynamics of civic associations and their

      capacity to contribute to democratisation [Robinson, 1995].

<p>

<li>Efforts at micro-level will yield little benefit in the absence of a conducive policy framework

      at macro and meso level. Development from below requires development from above.

      Donor agencies that are serious about decentralisation need to careful analyse the limits of

      this strategy and to provide adequate support to other levels of government as well.

      Additional research could provide guidance on how this can be done effectively.

</center></h5>

<hr>



Post-independence development strategies gave the state a lead role in managing development,

often at the exclusion of other actors in society. This led the public sector to expand well beyond

its managerial and financial possibilities. During the 1980's, a global consensus

emerged on the limits to what the public sector can achieve in promoting growth and development.

The new neo-liberal doctrine emphasized adjustment, deregulation, and privatisation. Particularly in

sub-Saharan Africa, attacks were launched on the developmental state. Structural adjustment

programmes challenged the state's monopoly on power and the African state, formerly the exclusive recipient, partner and rationale for international aid, lost its most favoured status. These changes created space for other actors in development and contributed

to the drive towards democratisation processes. At the same time, the concept of "good governance" became the new buzzword.

<p>

In recent years, the overall thrust of this new development orthodoxy has been challenged. Four

main reasons can be identified for this. First, simply "rolling back the state" proved to be no

panacea. Policies introduced to reduce the size and cost of the civil service, for instance, led to a

dramatic erosion in wage levels, such that the public sector could no longer attract and retain

qualified staff. As a result, capacity often shrank to dangerously low levels. 

<p>

Second, the long-running "state-versus-market" debate lost much of its poignancy. Indiscriminate

privatization and dismantling of the state was perceived to be as much an error as the earlier whole-cloth commitment to centralist-bureaucratic organization.

Experience in East Asia highlights the critical role of a strong and efficient government, and a "combat-ready" African public administration system is considered to require clarity of role and scope as well as ability to determine optimal levels of involvement.

 <p>

Third, research indicates that links between democratisation and development remain haphazard. Developing countries that have been successful in pursuing

growth and alleviating poverty are generally those whose politics have concentrated sufficient power, probity, autonomy and competence at the centre to shape, pursue and encourage the achievement of explicit and nationally-determined development objectives. 

<p>

Fourth, the limitations of "civil society" actors as development agents are increasingly recognised.

In gerenal, civil society actors, including NGO's, are still very weak in organizational terms and

doubts have been raised as to their capacity to have significant impact on political reform. In many cases, the division between state and civil society is not obvious,

and there is an awareness that a multitude of civil society organizations, operating outside national policy frameworks, will yield few results in their efforts to treat the development problems of Africa.

<p>

While there are very few defenders of the highly centralised bureaucratic state, the pendulum may

have swung too far in reducing the scope of action of the public sector. The key challenge now is

to ensure the transition from a role in which [governments] dominated the development policy

process to one in which they provide an enabling environment for a variety of relatively autonomous institutional actors.

<p>

This paper provides a concrete example of one such transition process in managing development

cooperation resources. Decentralised cooperation was one of the innovations of the fourth Lom&#233; Convention signed in 1989 between the European Union (EU) and 69 ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) states. It makes a wide variety of development actors eligible to use Lom&#233; resources which, in the past, were the monopoly of central government agencies. This innovation reflected changing

(donor) perceptions on the state-society relationship and development cooperation modalities. Yet

putting the concept into practice has proven difficult, and the results of decentralised cooperation under Lom&#233; IV have, so far, been dismal.

</center></h5>

<hr>

<h3>Summary</h3>

Modes of donor assistance shift according to the policies and

attitudes changing in the donor community and in the donor countries

themselves. However, the effects of the interventions are also

highly dependent on the policies of the recipient countries, and

only when the policies of both partners converge and support each

other, are the chances for successful and lasting results good.

<P>

The emergence of a renewed interest in local government and decentralisation

in the early 1990's is  due to several reasons:

<UL>

<LI> increased emphasis on popular participation and democratisation

(in which, the decentralisation of decisions for local communities

is seen to be essential);

<LI> the economic crisis forcing donors and national governments

to look for other ways to mobilise local resources;

<LI> frustration with the results of planning and implementation

through central governments which lack capacity and legitimacy;

<LI> the recognition that a well-functioning public administration

is an indispensable part of a modern developing society consisting

of both a private, market-driven production sector and a service-delivering

public sector, managed by legitimate and representative political

leaders, both at national level and at the level of local governments.

</UL>

<P>

The donor community has slowly, but increasingly realised the

development potential of decentralisation and popular participation,

and acted by supporting local reform processes, decentralised

planning, or specific local government programmes. However, there

are not many studies on the experiences gained from such donor

supported interventions, and very few as viewed from local government.

Most of the available studies appear to conclude that donors can

only play a modest role in decentralisation processes.

<P>

In this paper, decentralisation and donor interventions is seen

from the <U>perspective of a local government</U> in Uganda, as

experienced by the Rakai District during 1990-95. This period

covers the preparation of the Rakai District Development Programme

(RDDP), supported by the Danish International Development Assistance

(DANIDA), the implementation of phase 1 (January, 1992 up to September,

1995) and the preparation of phase 2 (running from October 1995

to September 1999). Experiences from Rakai show that if a national

policy aiming at substantial devolution of powers and resources

to local governments exists, then donor interventions are important

in terms of providing resources and illuminating strategic options

for local governments, and that their procedures and approaches

can be a major factor in determining for the level of political

and administrative capacity-building</U>, i.e. in developing democratic

decision-making and local participation.

<P>

In the following, a brief introduction to Ugandan decentralisation

policy is given. The actual implementation by the central government

and line ministries is illustrated through a discussion of the

difficult changes of attitudes and activities that followed the

enactment of the Local Government Statute in 1993. The creation

and key elements of the DANIDA-supported programme are presented

and followed by a brief account of related interventions of other

donors in the District. Finally, a number of conclusions and recommendations

relevant to decentralised cooperation as presented. These reflect

the view from Rakai District, situated at a cross-roads where

the interventions of donors meet the interference of Central Government.

La question de la coh&eacute;rence des politiques sectorielles
europ&eacute;ennes avec la politique de coop&eacute;ration au
d&eacute;veloppement n'est pas un vain d&eacute;bat technocratique
&#171; bruxellois &#187; mais constitue un enjeu majeur pour le
d&eacute;veloppement de nombreux pays, et donc pour l'efficacit&eacute;
et le cr&eacute;dit de la politique europ&eacute;enne de coop&eacute;ration.
<P>
Depuis de nombreuses ann&eacute;es, certains observateurs d&eacute;noncent
les contradictions entre les politiques relatives au commerce
et &agrave; l'agriculture et la politique de coop&eacute;ration
qui nuisent &agrave; l'efficacit&eacute; de celle-ci. Les cas
des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales et de la viande sont sans doute les

Cette question de la coh&eacute;rence fait officiellement partie
de l'agenda de travail de la Commission europ&eacute;enne depuis
la signature du Trait&eacute; de Maastricht, ce qui constitue

<B>L'exp&#233;rience v&#233;cue par la plus grande partie de l'Afrique
subsaharienne depuis plusieurs dizaines d'ann&#233;es met en &#233;vidence
le r&ocirc;le d&#233;terminant de la cr&#233;ation de capacit&#233;s
institutionnelles dans le processus de d&#233;veloppement. Ce r&ocirc;le porte
sur l'aptitude &#224; g&#233;rer les processus &#233;conomiques et sociaux,
y compris l'analyse et la formulation d'options de politique &#233;conomique,
en vue d'atteindre des objectifs de d&#233;veloppement tels que la
cr&#233;ation d'emplois et la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;. Les carences de
gestion de l'&#233;conomie nationale, aggrav&#233;es par les effets d'une
r&#233;cession prolong&#233;e dans la r&#233;gion, ont contribu&#233; au
niveau &#233;lev&#233; - et toujours croissant - du ch&ocirc;mage
d&#233;clar&#233; et du sous-emploi, &#224; la baisse des revenus par
habitant et des salaires r&#233;els et &#224; l'incidence accrue de la
mis&#232;re dans plusieurs pays africains. Ces r&#233;percussions
n&#233;gatives, qui compromettent la croissance &#233;conomique et le
d&#233;veloppement durable, sont li&#233;es - en tant que cause ou effet - aux
carences et &#224; l'instabilit&#233; du cadre institutionnel responsable de la
gestion et de l'administration publique.</b>
<p>
     L'origine de ces carences institutionnelles et de la faible capacit&#233; de
gestion constat&#233;es en Afrique aujourd'hui remonte &#224; l'&#233;poque
coloniale. Au moment de l'ind&#233;pendance, en effet, beaucoup de pays africains
n'&#233;taient pas dot&#233;s des capacit&#233;s institutionnelles et humaines
suffisantes pour g&#233;rer la transition du statut de colonie &#224; celui d'Etat
souverain, en particulier pour ce qui concerne la responsabilit&#233; de la gestion
&#233;conomique. La situation actuelle r&#233;sulte plus sp&#233;cifiquement
encore de la mani&#232;re in&#233;gale et d&#233;savantageuse dont l'Afrique a
&#233;t&#233; int&#233;gr&#233;e dans le syst&#232;me &#233;conomique
international &#224; la fin des ann&#233;es 1950 et au d&#233;but des ann&#233;es
1960. Le manque de savoir-faire technologique, l'inadaptation de l'infrastructure et
la limitation des ressources &#224; des fins d'investissement sont autant de facteurs
qui ont aggrav&#233; encore, au moment de l'ind&#233;pendance, les
probl&#232;mes li&#233;s &#224; l'insuffisance des capacit&#233;s institutionnelles,
et qui ont rendu de nombreux pays africains extr&ecirc;mement vuln&#233;rables aux
chocs ext&#233;rieurs.
<p>
     Rares sont les pays d'Afrique qui sont parvenus &#224; sortir de l'ancien
syst&#232;me productif et commercial "prot&#233;g&#233;" de l'&#233;poque
coloniale et &#224; diversifier leurs &#233;conomies suffisamment vite pour prendre
leur place au sein de l'&#233;conomie concurrentielle mondiale. Dans la plupart des
pays de ce continent, les capacit&#233;s humaines et institutionnelles de gestion ne
se sont pas d&#233;velopp&#233;es, depuis l'ind&#233;pendance, &#224; un rythme
permettant de s'adapter &#224; l'&#233;volution du contexte socio-&#233;conomique
national, d'une part, et de relever le d&#233;fi de la mondialisation, d'autre part. La
crise &#233;conomique actuelle ne permet pratiquement pas de rem&#233;dier
&#224; la p&#233;nurie critique de qualifications dont souffre l'Afrique en
mati&#232;re de gestion de la fonction publique et du secteur priv&#233;. Cette
r&#233;cession se traduit, par exemple, par un manque de financement et
d'&#233;quipement des &#233;tablissements de formation &#224; la gestion ainsi que
par le faible niveau de la r&#233;mun&#233;ration et de la motivation des services
publics. Dans le m&ecirc;me temps, la fuite des cerveaux vers d'autres continents,
en raison de perspectives extr&ecirc;mement limit&#233;es en termes de
r&#233;mun&#233;ration et de carri&#232;re, affaiblit davantage encore les
capacit&#233;s de l'Afrique.
<p>
L'interaction entre les donateurs &#233;trangers et les gouvernements africains n'a
pas toujours favoris&#233; la mise en place des capacit&#233;s requises. La Banque
mondiale elle-m&ecirc;me a reconnu que l'aide n'avait pas r&#233;pondu aux attentes
en mati&#232;re de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; en Afrique. La communaut&#233;
internationale des donateurs s'accorde aujourd'hui &#224; dire que l'assistance
technique &#233;trang&#232;re ne suffira pas - et ne peut suffire - &#224;
r&#233;gler tous les probl&#232;mes de d&#233;veloppement de la r&#233;gion.
Cette assistance technique impos&#233;e est parfois devenue, au contraire, un
facteur de destruction d'une capacit&#233; propre de d&#233;veloppement
indispensable &#224; la r&#233;solution des probl&#232;mes locaux. Ainsi,
l'inadaptation de l'assistance &#233;trang&#232;re en termes de conception de
projets, ou la discordance entre la conception et l'ex&#233;cution ou capacit&#233;
de gestion locale, peuvent devenir une composante du probl&#232;me au lieu d'en
&ecirc;tre la solution.
<p>
<H3>Les aspects conceptuels</H3>
<p>
     Il est important, avant d'envisager les besoins de cr&#233;ation de
capacit&#233;s institutionnelles dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement, de
pr&#233;ciser un certain nombre d'aspects li&#233;s au concept. Dans un contexte
de d&#233;veloppement, la cr&#233;ation de capacit&#233;s d&#233;signe
g&#233;n&#233;ralement un processus exhaustif couvrant la capacit&#233;
d'identifier des contraintes, d'une part, et de planifier et de g&#233;rer le
d&#233;veloppement, d'autre part. Ce processus implique habituellement la
valorisation des ressources humaines et des institutions ainsi qu'un climat favorable
au plan politique. Il vise id&#233;alement &#224; am&#233;liorer les capacit&#233;s
et ressources existantes, et &#224; les utiliser de mani&#232;re efficace dans la
perspective d'un d&#233;veloppement socio-&#233;conomique durable.
<p>
     Si l'on ram&#232;ne le concept au renforcement des institutions, l'accent sera
mis sur le d&#233;veloppement d'institutions particuli&#232;res, de leurs ressources
humaines et mat&#233;rielles, de leur gestion op&#233;rationnelle et de leurs
comp&#233;tences administratives. La mise en place de capacit&#233;s
institutionnelles vise plus sp&#233;cifiquement encore &#224; optimiser
l'efficacit&#233; et l'impact des institutions concern&#233;es en mati&#232;re de
gestion &#233;conomique, d'administration publique (y compris la gestion de projets),
de promotion des entreprises, etc. - tant dans le secteur public que dans le secteur
priv&#233;.
<p>
     Il va de soi que les institutions ax&#233;es sur le d&#233;veloppement
peuvent, au sein d'une &#233;conomie donn&#233;e, exercer une influence
d&#233;terminante sur la croissance et les perspectives d'emploi, voire sur
l'&#233;volution vers un d&#233;veloppement socio-&#233;conomique durable. D'un
point de vue macro&#233;conomique, les pays africains ont besoin d'institutions
responsables de la planification et d'autres aspects du d&#233;veloppement afin de
mieux g&#233;rer leurs &#233;conomies et &ecirc;tre capables de mobiliser, allouer
et utiliser de mani&#232;re optimale les ressources humaines et mat&#233;rielles
dont ils disposent. Au niveau micro&#233;conomique, les capacit&#233;s humaines
et institutionnelles constituent le fondement m&ecirc;me d'une bonne gestion des
projets et de l'administration publique.
<p>
<H3>Le contexte</H3>
<p>
     La situation actuelle de l'Afrique conduit &#224; penser que la mise en place
de capacit&#233;s doit intervenir prioritairement dans les domaines suivants:
<ul>
<li>la bonne gestion des affaires publiques afin d'assurer la stabilit&#233; ;
<p>
<li>la gestion &#233;conomique afin de maximiser la mobilisation de ressources et
de promouvoir le d&#233;veloppement durable ;
<p>
<li>le d&#233;veloppement des ressources humaines afin de favoriser la
cr&#233;ation    d'emplois et la g&#233;n&#233;ration de revenus, et de r&#233;duire
ainsi la pauvret&#233; ;
<p>
<li>les sciences et technologies afin d'accro&icirc;tre le rendement de la population
et de faciliter le d&#233;veloppement de l'infrastructure ;
<p>
<li>la promotion des entreprises afin de renforcer le r&ocirc;le essentiel du secteur
priv&#233; dans le processus de d&#233;veloppement.
</ul><p>
     La priorit&#233; relative de chacun de ces domaines peut varier selon le
contexte en fonction du niveau et de la complexit&#233; des capacit&#233;s
humaines et institutionnelles d&#233;j&#224; en place et des moyens financiers
de les soutenir, des r&ocirc;les respectifs du secteur public et du secteur
priv&#233;, et du degr&#233; de participation de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile aux
processus d&#233;cisionnels.
<p>
     Etant donn&#233; le d&#233;fi que doivent relever les pays africains en
mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement, la mise en place de capacit&#233;s dans
la r&#233;gion exige avant tout des comp&#233;tences humaines et
institutionnelles suffisantes pour planifier et g&#233;rer le processus de
d&#233;veloppement socio-&#233;conomique. Ces comp&#233;tences doivent
notamment porter sur les techniques d'&#233;valuation des r&#233;sultats et
effets de la mise en place de capacit&#233;s institutionnelles sur la lutte contre la
pauvret&#233;, la cr&#233;ation d'emplois, etc. Si les institutions publiques
actuellement charg&#233;es de la planification et de la gestion du
d&#233;veloppement peuvent servir de cadre op&#233;rationnel pour la mise en
place de ces capacit&#233;s, il convient &#233;galement d'y faire participer les
diverses forces sociales, le secteur priv&#233; et les institutions non
gouvernementales.
<p>
     En ce qui concerne le r&ocirc;le des donateurs ext&#233;rieurs et des
agences d'assistance technique, l'approche doit se fonder sur un concept de
"partenariat au d&#233;veloppement" impliquant une concertation et un dialogue
entre le donateur et le b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire sur toutes les questions de
programmation, de conception et d'ex&#233;cution des projets - la
"propri&#233;t&#233;" des projets restant entre les mains des autorit&#233;s
nationales. L'assistance technique &#233;trang&#232;re devrait donc s'orienter
vers le d&#233;veloppement des capacit&#233;s locales requises plut&ocirc;t que
de contribuer &#224; saper les capacit&#233;s existantes ou potentielles. L'aide
des donateurs ext&#233;rieurs devrait, en outre, &ecirc;tre affect&#233;e &#224;
la mise en place de capacit&#233;s visant &#224; promouvoir la coop&#233;ration
et l'int&#233;gration &#233;conomiques r&#233;gionales par le soutien
d'organisations africaines r&#233;gionales et subr&#233;gionales viables et
ax&#233;es sur le d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
<H3>Les initiatives de soutien</H3>
<p>
     La question de la cr&#233;ation de capacit&#233;s institutionnelles locales
en Afrique fait l'objet d'une attention croissante de la part de l'ensemble de la
communaut&#233; des donateurs. L'ancien Vice-Pr&#233;sident de la Banque
mondiale charg&#233; de l'Afrique, Edward Jaycox, a effectivement d&#233;crit la
cr&#233;ation de capacit&#233;s comme "le cha&icirc;non manquant du
d&#233;veloppement africain" pourtant indispensable au succ&#232;s des efforts
de d&#233;veloppement d&#233;ploy&#233;s par cette r&#233;gion. PNUD en
t&ecirc;te, les agences des Nations Unies font d&#233;sormais valoir la mise en
place de capacit&#233;s institutionnelles comme l'une des pierres angulaires d'un
d&#233;veloppement durable.
<p>
     Une d&#233;cision prise par le Conseil d'Administration du PNUD en 1991
a conduit &#224; l'&#233;laboration de directives concernant l'aide fournie aux
gouvernements pour la formulation et la mise en oeuvre de leurs strat&#233;gies
de renforcement des capacit&#233;s &#224; tous les stades du cycle des projets
men&#233;s dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement. Cette d&#233;cision a
co&iuml;ncid&#233; avec l'adoption par le PNUD d'une "approche-programme" qui
place les programmes nationaux de d&#233;veloppement au coeur du processus
d'int&#233;gration de l'assistance technique des NU. Le recours prioritaire aux
comp&#233;tences nationales pour le processus de d&#233;veloppement a
&#233;t&#233; confirm&#233; par le cadre op&#233;rationnel g&#233;n&#233;ral
d'"ex&#233;cution nationale" : celui-ci pr&#233;cise en effet que la
responsabilit&#233; globale de la gestion et de la transparence des actions
op&#233;rationnelles des NU reste confi&#233;e au gouvernement, autres
institutions nationales ou b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires qui sont "propri&#233;taires"
des actions en question. Ces nouvelles modalit&#233;s conf&#232;rent donc une
priorit&#233; absolue au renforcement et au soutien &#224; long terme des
capacit&#233;s d'administration et de gestion du d&#233;veloppement, qui font
d&#233;sormains partie int&#233;grante de l'assistance technique du PNUD.
<p>
     L'int&#233;r&ecirc;t manifest&#233; par la Banque mondiale &#224;
l'&#233;gard de la mise en place de capacit&#233;s en Afrique a &#233;t&#233;
davantage li&#233; &#224; la n&#233;cessit&#233; d'instaurer au niveau national
des comp&#233;tences techniques et administratives capables d'assurer l'analyse
et la gestion &#233;conomique dans le cadre des programmes d'ajustement
structurel et de r&#233;forme &#233;conomique. Faisant oeuvre de pionnier lors
de son allocution &#224; la Conf&#233;rence de l'African-American Institute en
1993, M. Jaycox a pr&ocirc;n&#233; une nouvelle approche des pr&ecirc;ts
accord&#233;s aux pays d'Afrique, lesquels donneraient d&#233;sormais la
priorit&#233; absolue au d&#233;veloppement des capacit&#233;s humaines et
institutionnelles dont ces pays ont un urgent besoin. Il a reconnu que le
programme de pr&ecirc;t de 4 milliards $ octroy&#233; par la Banque &#224;
l'Afrique subsaharienne n'avait pas eu l'impact souhait&#233; sur le
d&#233;veloppement r&#233;gional, et explique cet insucc&#232;s par une
n&#233;gligence de longue date &#224; l'&#233;gard des capacit&#233;s
nationales. M. Jaycox a &#233;galement critiqu&#233; la communaut&#233; des
donateurs et les institutions financi&#232;res internationales, y compris la Banque
mondiale elle-m&ecirc;me, qui con&#231;oivent et m&#232;nent des activit&#233;s
d'assistance technique non seulement incapables de r&#233;soudre les
probl&#232;mes mais qui finissent par saper la capacit&#233; de
d&#233;veloppement propre de l'Afrique. M. Jaycox a donc plaid&#233; en faveur
d'un soutien direct &#224; la mise en place de capacit&#233;s institutionnelles au
travers des programmes de pr&ecirc;t de la Banque et d'une priorit&#233;, dans
ce contexte, au d&#233;veloppement des ressources humaines et &#224; la
cr&#233;ation d'une "demande de professionnalisme" en Afrique.
<p>
     Le PNUD, la Banque africaine de D&#233;veloppement et la Banque
mondiale ont conjointement fond&#233;, au d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 1990,
l'ACBF (African Capacity Building Foundation) ; cet organisme, dont le si&#232;ge
se trouve &#224; Harare (Zimbabwe), a &#233;t&#233; dot&#233; d'un capital
d'amor&#231;age de 30 millions $ environ auquel sont venus s'ajouter 70 millions
$ &#233;manant de donateurs bilat&#233;raux et des gouvernements africains
eux-m&ecirc;mes. Ces fonds sont destin&#233;s &#224; soutenir le renforcement
des capacit&#233;s en Afrique par le biais de la formation et de la mise en place
d'institutions. Une attention particuli&#232;re est accord&#233;e &#224; la
r&#233;habilitation et au d&#233;veloppement d'un certain nombre de centres de
recherche et de formation afin de relever le d&#233;fi d'une cr&#233;ation de
capacit&#233;s locales. L'Africa Research Consortium de Nairobi, autre initiative
lanc&#233;e gr&#226;ce &#224; des donateurs ext&#233;rieurs mais
&#233;galement &#224; des ressources int&#233;rieures, offre un second
exemple positif de coop&#233;ration &#224; l'&#233;chelon r&#233;gional en vue
d'un renforcement des capacit&#233;s dans le domaine critique de la gestion et
de l'analyse de la politique &#233;conomique. Dans la m&ecirc;me perspective, la
Banque africaine de D&#233;veloppement a particip&#233; &#224; la
cr&#233;ation de l'African Business Round Table qui vise &#224; promouvoir
l'esprit d'entreprise et un d&#233;veloppement des entreprises fond&#233; sur le
principe de la propri&#233;t&#233; et du contr&ocirc;le de celles-ci par les
Africains eux-m&ecirc;mes.
<p>
<H3>Le r&ocirc;le de l'OIT</H3>
<p>
     Depuis plus de trente ans, l'OIT participe, au titre de son programme de
coop&#233;ration technique avec l'Afrique, &#224; toute une s&#233;rie
d'initiatives ax&#233;es sur l'am&#233;lioration des techniques de gestion, la
productivit&#233; et la mise en place d'institutions &#224; l'&#233;chelon national
et r&#233;gional. Cette d&#233;marche r&#233;pond &#224; un besoin urgent de
renforcer les &#233;tablissements africains de formation afin qu'ils puissent doter
les responsables du d&#233;veloppement des comp&#233;tences requises pour
l'analyse et la formulation d'options de politique &#233;conomique, ainsi que pour
la gestion efficace des entreprises publiques et priv&#233;es.
<p>
     L'un des succ&#232;s dans ce contexte est assur&#233;ment l'initiative
prise par l'OIT en coop&#233;ration avec le PNUD et l'Institut de
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique (IDE) de la Banque mondale, &#224;
savoir le programme UNEDIL pour l'am&#233;lioration de la formation &#224; la
gestion en Afrique. D&#232;s son d&#233;marrage en 1987, le programme
UNEDIL a confirm&#233; sa valeur en tant que contribution &#224; la mise en
place de capacit&#233;s institutionnelles en mati&#232;re de gestion. Ce
programme a &#233;galement b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; du soutien d'instituts
africains (nationaux et r&#233;gionaux) de formation &#224; la gestion (MDI),
d'organisations r&#233;gionales et subr&#233;gionales telles que la SADC et le
Secr&#233;tariat du Commonwealth, et d'importants donateurs bilat&#233;raux
tels que USAID, la CIDA, la NORAD, les Pays-Bas et la France.
<p>
     Outre le renforcement des capacit&#233;s institutionnelles, le programme
UNEDIL a largement favoris&#233; le travail en r&#233;seau entre les instituts
africains de d&#233;veloppement ainsi que la promotion de contacts
professionnels et l'&#233;change d'exp&#233;riences. Le programme est
notamment parvenu &#224; relancer les trois associations subr&#233;gionales de
MDI, qui re&#231;oivent un appui direct de l'UNEDIL et servent de points de
convergence dans le cadre des accords subr&#233;gionaux de travail en
r&#233;seau.
<p>
     La mise en r&#233;seau &#224; l'&#233;chelon subr&#233;gional a permis
d'optimiser l'utilisation des rares ressources et talents, contribuant ainsi au
renforcement des capacit&#233;s de gestion de l'ensemble de la r&#233;gion.
Cette collaboration a &#233;galement permis aux instituts africains
d'&#233;changer leurs exp&#233;riences et de rassembler les comp&#233;tences
ext&#233;rieures et int&#233;rieures en vue du d&#233;veloppement des
capacit&#233;s de gestion de l'Afrique enti&#232;re. Cette approche r&#233;pond
aux objectifs de la coop&#233;ration technique en g&#233;n&#233;ral, et de la
coop&#233;ration Sud-Sud en particulier.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>THE PEOPLE'S COMMUNICATION CHARTER</b></font><p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4>The facts of pervasive world-wide governmental and commercial
censorship; distorted and misleading information; stereotyped and damaging images of the human
condition including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexuality, physical and mental illness and disability;
restricted access to knowledge, and insufficient channels to communicate diverse ideas and opinions are
basic to this initiative.<p>

	The cultural environment is as vital to our common future as the natural ecology. But the reality of our
cultural environment reduces the capacity of ordinary women and men to control decisions about their
lives and about the socialization of their children. It is time for individual citizens and their organizations to
take an active role in the shaping of the cultural environment into which all children are born and in which
all people live and learn.<p>

	The founding institutions of the Charter movement are: the Centre for Communication & Human
Rights (The Netherlands); Third World Network (Malaysia); the Cultural Environment Movement (USA); and
AMARCWorld Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (Peru/Canada).<p>

	The present version of the Charter was considered and discussed during the Founding Convention of the
Cultural Environment Movement meeting in St. Louis (USA) 15-17 March 1996. It was referred for further
action to the elected Steering Committee of the Cultural Environment Movement.</font>
<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Preamble</b></font><br>
We, the Signatories of this Charter:
<ul><li>Affirm that communication is basic to the life of all individuals and their communities;
	<li>Affirm that all people are entitled to participate in communication within and between societies;
	<li>Recognize that people's access to communication facilities is very unequally distributed and that the
majority of the world's people lacks even the minimal technological resources for communication;
	<li>Recognize that in a growing number of countries information and culture are not provided primarily
as a public service but for private gain;
	<li>Recognize that control of communication is essential for freedom of action, that communication
confers power, and that today's 'communication revolution' tends to further widen the gaps between
the communication rich and the communication poor in the world;
	<li>Observe that the concentration of commercial operators on the world communication market
erodes the public sphere, displaces public media, endangers the provision of a plurality of opinions, a
diversity of cultural expressions, and the use of minority languages (including sign language);
	<li>Observe that today's media contents present audiences massive amounts of violence which suggest
violence as a legitimate solution to problems and which make people fearful of becoming victims and thus
disempower them;
	<li>Observe that global media entertainment employs gendered stereotypes that misrepresent both
women and men.
	<li>Therefore, we affirm that all people are entitled to equal access to the resources they need for
communication within and between their societies.
	<li>We equally affirm the need for people to develop their own communication channels through which
they can speak for themselves and tell their own stories.
	<li>We reaffirm with regard to the freedom of information, the social responsibility of the mass media,
the development of communication, and the protection of cultural and linguistic rights the pertinent
provisions in international law as listed in the Annexe to the Charter.
	<li>We want to strengthen current provisions on information, communication, and culture under
international law, and in particular the mechanisms for their implementation.
</ul><p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Objectives</b></font><br>
The Charter intends to contribute to a critical understanding of the significance of communication in the
daily lives of all individuals and their communities.<p>

	While recognizing the diversity among communities and individuals, the Charter articulates a shared
position on communication from the perspective of common interests, needs and rights.
<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Scope of application</b></font><br>
Signatories to the Charter can be individuals and organizations. Approval represents an expression of
goals that does not limit independence and freedom of action of the signatories.
<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Definitions</b></font><br>
The term 'Charter' as used in this Charter means a set of guidelines that are voluntarily adopted by the
signatories and that are used as their common frame of reference in communication issues.
<ul><li>The term 'communication' refers to all interactive processes through which individuals and
communities share opinions, information, feelings and ideas.
	<li>The term 'information' is understood in a very broad sense and includes news as well as
entertainment.
	<li>The term 'media' refers to publicly or privately owned mass media for print or electronic
communication.
	<li>The term 'cyberspace' refers to the virtual spaces which are facilitated through the use of computer
networks and where people establish new communities for learning, working and sharing of interests.
</ul><p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Guidelines: General Standards</b></font><br>
Article 1.<br>
All people are entitled to the respect of their inalienable dignity. All people will be treated in accordance with
the basic human rights standards of integrity, identity, nondiscrimination and freedom.
<p>

Article 2.<br>
People have the right to freedom of expression and distribution of opinions, information, feelings and
ideas, in any language, without interference by public or private interests. In order to exercise this right,
people should have fair and equitable access to channels of communication and to adequate resources
and facilities.
<p>

Article 3.<br>
People have the right to receive opinions, information and ideas in a language they understand. The right
to be informed about matters of public interest and the right to receive a range of information and
cultural products designed for a wide variety of tastes and interests, demand communication channels
that are independent from governmental, political or commercial control.
<p>

Article 4.<br>
People have the right to gather information in a language they understand. This includes the right of
access to government information and information on matters of public interest held by public
authorities or private interests. There can only be restrictions on access to government and privately
held information of public interest if such restrictions are necessary for the protection of a democratic
society or the basic rights of others.
<p>

Article 5.<br>
Meaningful realization of people's right to participate in, contribute to and benefit from the development
of self-reliant communication infrastructures requires international assistance to the development of
independent media; training programmes for professional media workers; the establishment of
independent, representative associations, syndicates or trade unions of journalists and associations of
editors and publishers; and international co-operation in the field of policy making, regulation and
management of media.
<p>

Article 6.<br>
People have the right to acquire the skills necessary to participate fully in public communication. This
requires basic literacy in reading and writing, training in story telling, as well as media literacy, computer
literacy and critical education about the role of communication in society in a language people understand.
<p>

Article 7.<br>
Since information of public interest will often be gathered on behalf of the people by professionals,
effective measures to ensure the safety of journalists on dangerous missions are essential. To be secure
in their persons, journalists must be accorded full protection of the law. For journalists working in zones of
armed conflict, the appropriate provisions in international humanitarian law should be respected and
enforced. In accordance with these provisions journalists must be recognized as civilians enjoying rights
and immunities accorded to all civilians in order to conduct their professional duties without harm.
Journalists must have safe, unrestricted access to sources of information in order to provide the public
with a balanced and adequate reflection of all sides of events. If these rights are not guaranteed,
journalists must be able to seek justice through an international body protecting human rights.
<p>

Article 8.<br>
People have the right of reply. In relation to information concerning individuals published in any medium,
the individuals concerned shall have an effective possibility for correction, without undue delay, of false
statements relating to them which they have a justified interest in having corrected, such corrections
being given, as far as practical, the same prominence as the original expression.
<p>

Article 9.<br>
People have the right to a diversity of languages. This includes the right to express themselves and have
access to information in their own language, the right to use their own languages as media of instruction
in educational institutions funded by the state and the right to have adequate provisions created for
minority languages in the media.
<p>

Article 10.<br>
People have the right to protect their cultural identity. This includes the respect for people's free pursuit
of their cultural development and the right to express existing cultural and linguistic variety through the
media as well as to receive a variety of cultural expressions in languages they understand. People have the
right to the protection of their local cultural space and provisions for the protection of cultural heritage
should be established. These entitlements can only be restricted in the case that they are used to justify
human rights violations.
<p>

Article 11.<br>
People have the right to participate in public decision-making on the provision of information, on the
development and utilization of knowledge, on the preservation, protection and development of culture,
On the choice, development and application of communication technologies, and on the structure of
media industries.
<p>

Article 12.<br>
All forms of public regulation on communication should be transparent. This includes the right of the public
to receive full information on public policies in the field of information, knowledge, culture and
communication technology in a language they understand. Public transparency should also extend to the
practices and organizational structures of large private operators. This means that information on the
ownership patterns of private communication corporations should be publicly accessible.
<p>

Article 13.<br>
Children have the right to mass media products that are designed to meet their needs and interests.
Countries should take the necessary steps to provide and make available quality cultural and
entertainment products, including by public provision when commercial media fail in this regard.
<p>

Article 14.<br>
The mass media should have particular regard to the linguistic needs of the child who belongs to a
minority group or who is indigenous.
<p>

Article 15.<br>
People have a right to universal access to and equitable use of cyberspace. With the increasing importance
of cyberspace for many social activities, people's rights to free and open communities in cyberspace, their
freedom of electronic expression, and the protection of their privacy against electronic surveillance and
intrusion should be secured.
<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Guidelines: Protective standards</b></font><br>
Article 16.<br>
Societies vary in the extent and ways they protect the privacy of individuals. The media should respect
people's right to respect for their private lives. Privacy concerns private, family and home life, physical and
moral integrity, honour and reputation, avoidance of being placed in a false light, non-revelation of
irrelevant and embarrassing facts, unauthorized publication of private photographs, protection against
misuse of private communication, protection from disclosure of information given or received by the
individual confidentially. Nevertheless, countries should take care that the legal protection of privacy does
not unduly interfere with the freedom of expression.
<p>

Article 17.<br>
The media should avoid the prejudicial treatment of persons. This means that the media should refrain
from the use of images that distort the realities and complexities of people's lives or that fuel prejudice by
discriminatory descriptions of people and situations.
<p>

Article 18.<br>
People have the right to respect for the standard of due process in the coverage of criminal cases by the
media. This standard implies that the media should not declare defendants guilty before courts have
established a verdict of guilt, and may report but should not televise criminal trials in real time, while the
trials are going on.
<p>

Article 19.<br>
People have the right to be protected against misleading and distorted information. This right concerns
the dissemination of news, the provision of consumer information, and in particular advertising directed
at children.
<p>

Article 20.<br>
People's fundamental right to communicate can only be restricted if limitations are prescribed by
international human rights standards and are necessary in democratic societies.
<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Accountability and responsibility</b></font><br>
Article 21.<br>
The media should establish mechanisms, including selfregulatory bodies, to address their accountability
to the general public. The media should act consistently with the fundamental right of citizens to receive
accurate and full information on matters of public interest.
<p>

Article 22.<br>
Media users should organize to establish voluntary associations through which they monitor and assess
the performance of the media.
<p>

Article 23.<br>
People have the right to hold information providers accountable for the accuracy of their information and
establish liability in case inaccurate information causes damage. This should not construe undue limits for
the freedom of expression, but States should consider imposing liability for proven damage or other
remedies such as required corrections at least where it is proven in a court of law that an information
provider has wilfully disseminated inaccurate or misleading information or has facilitated the dissemination
of such information.
<p>

Article 24.<br>
In accordance with international human rights standards all people have the duty to strive towards the
respect of human rights. In the light of this we urge all people to contribute to the implementation of the
provisions of this Charter.
<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Implementation of the Charter</b></font><br>
Article 25.<br>
In order to ensure and promote the implementation of the Charter, the Signatories shall: (a) make all
necessary efforts to publicize and disseminate the Charter to the widest possible audience; (b) monitor in
their own environment the performance of media, information providers and producers of culture in the
light of the standards proposed in the Charter.
<p>

Article 26.<br>
In consultation with those who support the Charter a series of national and international mechanisms will
be organized: (a) to receive complaints about violations of the provisions of the Charter; (b) to advise on
adequate remedial measures; (c) to develop proposals for development and modification of the Charter;
(d) to co-ordinate the regular review of the Charter by the signatories.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Opportunities and strategies for democratic media<br>Se&aacute;n
&Oacute; Siochr&uacute;</b></font>

<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5>This article contributes to the emerging debate on what a strategy to
promote democratic media might look like, one that on the one hand consciously counters the
commercial mass-media now sweeping all before them on the global stage; and on the other develops its
own sense of identity, dynamic and destiny. It considers: the strengths and weaknesses of both
democratic media alternatives and of global commercial media; some basic building blocks for developing a
successful collective strategy for democratic media; a few tentative short-term strategic goals that
might be pursued, raising in particular the opportunities created, ironically, by the process of media
neo-liberalisation.</font>

<p>

Readers of Media Development are familiar with the irrepressible nature and vibrant growth of
democratic media around the world: alternative, usually community based, media motivated not by
profit, but by solidarity, the struggle for existence or creative expression; media that empower not
pacify, that create not simply repeat. The emergence from sometimes desperate circumstances of
people striving to articulate a voice, to create an identity and broadcast an image offers inspiration to all
those who believe that the media can and must be a force for democracy and development. 
<p>But it is also important not to overstate the facts. The fragile and often sporadic nature of
democratic media is demonstrated by the many initiatives that emerge with great hopes, only to
disappear through lack of a permanent sustainable base and adverse circumstances beyond their control.
It would be a mistake to underestimate the scale of the task ahead for democratic media if it is to
become a significant force in peoplesÕ lives, from local to global levels. Building beyond isolated, often
spontaneous and self-sacrificing, media projects towards an enduring and mutually sustaining democratic
media sector is going to demand a qualitatively new level of organisation.

<p>This is already happening within specific media at national level, and internationally with AMARC,
Vidazimut, APC and others. Yet a further level of solidarity and common action is required before these
sectoral activities can create a platform for sustained growth. The time has come, and the opportunity is
there, to develop a strategy for democratic media as a whole, to pull together the different strands
around the central theme of media participation and democracy, transcending individual media to what
they hold in common.

<p>A premise is that the democratic media movement cannot strategically be content simply to pursue
its own activities, filling what niches are available to it - but remaining oblivious to the continuing growth of
the great forces of the commercial sector. For much of the growth in democratic media has, consciously
or unconsciously, been in response to pressures emanating from the commercialisation, privatisation and
commodification of communication. The trend away from public service goals and towards market
mediation of output, and the homogenisation of form and content of the mainstream media, are well
enough documented to need no rehearsal here. Many local alternatives emerge in direct response to
these trends, reclaiming a space that has become alien to local populations and disconnected from their
needs. They attempt to compensate for the distortion of media space and communication processes,
and somehow wrest back control over content, production and the ultimate purpose of the media.
<p>Thus, the democratic media movement is essentially local in outlook and emerges often not from a
positive agenda, but in opposition to a self-confident and aggressive mainstream that recognises no
boundaries. Insofar as they are created as an antithesis, community media must go further and invent
their own proper identity. If they are to achieve self-sustaining growth, they must generate a dynamic of
their own, a collective dynamic beyond individual efforts and isolated opposition.
<p>This article therefore argues that democratic media cannot but set itself against, in every sense,
commercial media.  It must compare and contrast its strengths and weakness, and set out deliberately
to develop a coherent, viable, and rapidly expanding sphere of democratisation.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Strengths and weaknesses</b></font><br>
The recent success of privately owned empires, and of commercial media as a whole, is the result of a
coincidence of a diverse set of factors, not all of them within the boundaries of the sector. Within the
media sector, a significant place can be attributed to the following:
<ol><li>Commercial media operate at all geographical levels. Intra or inter-corporate connections exchange
content and generate economies of scale and scope from local to national and global levels. But
commercial media collectively and individually also lobby hard, bringing strategic influence to bear on
inter-governmental organisations, national governments, and even at the local level.
<li>There are numerous cross connections between the different strands of commercial media (film,
video, television, telecommunications, newspapers etc.) not just in ownership, but also in terms of
cross-marketing, strategic goals, lobbying, and other mutually reinforcing strategies.
<li>Commercial media appeal to real desires of people, and are in a position to constantly reinforce those
desires and deepen their ÔmarketsÕ.
<li>Each medium projects a clear identity, purpose and aim into the public sphere; and, although each is
different, they are all more and more associated with a single distinct set of characteristics and lifestyles
that espouses consumption as the key to fulfilment.
<li>They have a sustainable and secure economic base, and supporting economic structures.
<li>They have a clear strategy, both individually and collectively. Competition between them, sometimes
fierce, does not distract them from recognising and acting on their common interests, with little need for
direct collaboration, overt or covert.</ol>
<p>Contrasting starkly are the democratic media:
<ol><li>They originate locally, and usually remain at that level.
<li>Often isolated from each other, different media maintain relatively few interactions and exchanges.
<li>They sometimes suffer from existential doubt, motivated by broad political and social concerns or
narrow local issues, and having to work hard to develop or retain links to local realities.
<li>Only exceptionally can democratic media individually develop a clear identity among the public, even
among those with whom they come in direct contact; and collectively they have virtually no easily
discernible unifying thread.
<li>They have no secure economic base, relying on scarce local resources and temporary external
support.
<li>Democratic media seldom engage in strategic planning, individually or collectively, although there is
evidence that this is changing. </ol>
<p>Of course, this is not to suggest that, to achieve their aims, democratic media should be structured in
a manner similar to commercial media. Indeed, what is a strength to one can be a weakness to the other.
The above factors must thus be filtered through the priorities of commercial and of democratic media,
the former motivated by profit and sometimes megalomania, the latter engaged in a process of
empowerment and democratisation. 
<p>Most fundamentally, commercial media can relate to people only as consumers of commodities, and
command their loyalty only to the extent that these commodities are seen as desirable and continue to
be delivered. Democratic media, on the other hand, are open and participative, needing to ensure
accountability at every level. People can identify with the common objectives and collaborate in the
struggle to achieve them, enabling community media to draw on much deeper resources. Similarly,
commercial media command peopleÕs attention as a separate and discrete part of their lives, often walled
off from other aspects of social and economic reality; whereas democratic media enable people to
engage more closely with their broader realities.
<p>Nevertheless, these factors, suitably modified, can offer long term strategic milestones in terms of
indicating the maturity of democratic media. 
<p>The following explores what might be required to build a movement for democratic media, in terms of
the factors above.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>The need for a global dimension</b></font><br>
At the global level, mainstream commercial media enjoy free reign, virtually immune from national
structures that until a decade or two ago constrained their activities. They face a weakened, often
floundering, intergovernmental system, in general meekly subservient to the major powers that it turn
have virtually identified their own national interests with those of their roving multi-national corporations
and of neo-liberalisation. Media conglomerates can enter almost any country, confident of their clear
identity, universal appeal and saleability of wares, often backed up by powerful national governments.
Their intergovernmental agents such as WTO and IMF smooth the way by negotiating irresistible deals
with corrupt or desperate politicians to gain Ômarket accessÕ.
<p>Democratic media cannot afford to ignore this dominance of mainstream media, not simply because
of the resultant sterilisation and homogenisation of media content, but because in very practical ways it
curtails their growth and room for manoeuvre, and their access to resources. For instance, in
telecommunications, new standards for Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) can seriously affect the cost for
community radio of getting involved in this area; for community and democratic TV, the gradual scaling
down and elimination of the development role of Intelsat affects the extent to which low-cost
transponders are available; and the implementation of a neo-liberal agenda in telecommunications by the
WTO, the World Bank and others could threaten universal service in many rural and poorer areas of
developing countries - including their access to e-mail and other services with development and
democratic potential.
<p>Behind the hegemony of neo-liberal ideas is the lack of a coherent alternative. A major success of the
commercial media and their attendants has been to present their own version of the way forward, the
commercialisation and globalisation of the media, as the only feasible one. In the realm of ideas, as well as
in direct influence, community democratic media thus have a major task ahead.
<p>Finally, democratic media have yet to establish any major voice beyond local and national levels, to
match those of direct broadcast television, of news agencies, and of publishers. The potential value of
sharing and distributing content and resources, and of reaching larger audiences, is undoubtedly also great
in democratic media. Though in less than global terms, this is illustrated, for example, in television by Deep
Dish and the proposed Mondiale Satellite Channel; and in news agencies, by IPS and AMARCÔs more recent
initiative for radio news in Latin America, Pulsar. But none imagines it seriously rivals the commercial
conglomerates, or is yet in a position to profit from the same economies of scale.
<p>The need for a global dimension thus exists at policy, ideological and at practical levels.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Cross-fertilisation of media</b></font><br>
There are huge commercial gains to be derived from linkages between the different media, especially film,
video, magazines, books, and increasingly computer software. Such cross-marketing of brands and
output, manipulating the desire for identification amid growing surface-level diversification, is hardly an
aspiration of democratic media. However, collaboration between the different media is valuable in a
number of ways. For instance:
<ul><li>In terms of output: E-mail and internet services can be used as a means to exchange written radio
news, audio tapes and even video clips for later broadcast;
<li>In terms of sharing: National or regional support organisations, providing resources centres,
newsletters, training, and so forth, can share facilities;
<li>Most important, in terms of consciousness raising and collaborative action: The exchange of
information amongst practitioners working in different areas of democratic media can clarify what they
have in common, and can reinforce the trend towards co-operative action and strategic development.
</ul><p>Collaboration should extend beyond the media sector per se, to find its strength in numbers.
More general movements for democracy in communications, academic associations and others pursuing
the right to communicate are natural allies, and can broaden the effective sphere of influence for
democratic media.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Clarifying aims and objectives</b></font><br>
Individual initiatives in democratic media usually have clear aims and objectives, arising from specific, often
time-bound, contexts. Even organisations at international level that represent a specific medium can
after some time and internal development, be reasonably clear about what they intend to achieve.
<p>However, there has been little attention devoted to the role of democratic media as a whole, beyond
simply the cumulation of individual initiatives. While rightly railing against the commercialisation of media
and the reduction of output to mass entertainment commodities, democratic media must be clear on
what it is proposing in their place, how they see their role and that of others. Are democratic media
proposing themselves as an alternative to mainstream media, with aspirations to supplant them?  How
are democratic media really different from local commercial media? Can they seriously expect ever to
occupy anything but a minor role, useful especially to oppressed groups at a certain stage of
development? Or are they an active niche area that complements the passive mainstream? Can they be a
harbinger of future mainstream media, of a truly participative society?  Can commercial media be
reformed in any significant ways?
<p>These questions will require answers if broad democratic media and communication movement are to
grow in self-understanding and direction. 

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Creating an identity</b></font><br>
Such a movement will also require a clear identity that all people can recognise as distinct from
commercial media, in the form both of individual media such as a local community radio station and of
democratic media in general. Knowing what it stands for is the first step in supporting any organisation;
and such knowledge must be both concrete (the right to participate in your local station and to demand
that it listen to your views) as well as abstract (the right to communicate and engage in democratic
processes).
<p>Creating this identity will, of course, hinge on questions of participation and the relationship between
the ÔaudienceÕ and the medium. Radio offers a useful example. Local commercial radio stations,
multiplying under liberalising regimes, often claim (fearing the loss of advertising revenue) that they
operate in effect as community radio. Hence, they argue, there is no need for a distinct licence category,
for instance, for non-profit stations to address community needs. However, what really distinguishes
them is not whether they are profit oriented or not, but their relationship with the ÔlistenersÕ.
Commercial local radio requires only that people listen, or engage in Ôpseudo-participativeÕ entertainment
and news programming. Democratic community radio, on the other hand, must open out its objectives,
staffing, programming, and all other aspects to its constituents, no longer simply listeners but now active
participants.
<p>It is thus not only on the basis of content, but also of process, that democratic media must construct
an identity, each specific medium interpreting this in its own way. 

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Real needs and a secure economic base</b></font><br>
Commercial media appeal to atomised people, fragmented from each other, and seeking some respite
from daily struggles - dreams of release and riches, no matter how unlikely, are better than none at all.
<p>The 'appeal' of democratic media is fundamentally different. There are no easy solutions on offer, no
Ôquick fixesÕ. Indeed what is offered is often a struggle, first to understand the nature of the media, then
to use them to challenge the order in which people seek solace in dreams in the first place. They also offer
the excitement of learning new ideas and skills, of exploring social relationships, and of engaging in
effective collective action.
<p>This is a far cry from relaxing to ÔNeighboursÕ and ÔDallasÕ, one demanding a high level of commitment
from the ÔaudienceÕ and a determined effort by the media organisations themselves. Nevertheless, while
democratic media might also (hopefully) offer entertainment, it is only by maintaining the primary focus
on real needs and struggles that they can strike a distinct chord with people.
<p>Since democratic media cannot afford the luxury of chasing the most lucrative and wealthiest
segments of the market, but must instead address pressing human needs, a secure economic base will
always represent a challenge. Those most in need of a voice are usually those least able to pay for it.
<p>Yet a stable economic base is essential for long-term growth. Development oriented NGOs and
national aid agencies have traditionally provided a level of support, but cannot, and should not, be relied
upon to continue supporting initiatives indefinitely. Rather, a secure economic base must be forthcoming,
both through fund-raising and the income generating capacity of the media themselves and also,
crucially, through securing legitimate, publicly supported, long-term income from national and regional
government (and possibly in the future, global governmental systems).

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Developing a strategic capacity</b></font><br>
Finally, none of the above can be achieved in the absence of a strong strategic capacity, from grassroots
initiatives to media sectors, to democratic media as a whole.
<p>Commercial media engage simultaneously in competitive activities with their rivals, and in ÔcollectiveÕ
(although largely autonomous) activities to support the sector as a whole through constantly recreating
and expanding the territory (geographic, economic and human) that they dominate. The strength of
democratic media, by contrast, must be in explicit co-operation and collaboration.
<p>A strategic capacity at global level does not come quickly and easily, especially when one is concerned
with the participative nature of the process. Learning to intervene effectively to influence governments,
intergovernmental organisations, public opinion, and indeed the commercial media requires a slow
accumulation of experience at all levels, methodically exchanged with others through formal and informal
means. Lessons can be learned outside the communication sector, for instance from the environmental
and gender movements.
<p>Slow or not, conscious and deliberate effort must be invested in developing and nurturing a strategic
capacity amongst democratic media.
<p>Reordering the above factors, they can be summarised as a set of long-term strategic goals for the
democratic media movement:
<ul><li>Clarify the potential and role for democratic media, and aims and objectives;
<li>Develop a strategic capacity, building from individual initiatives to global organisations;
<li>Engage with the issues at all levels, from local to global;
<li>Create a clear identity for democratic media, both individually and collectively, that all people can
readily understand;
<li>Maintain the focus on peopleÕs needs in their real lives, not on competing with mainstream media;
<li>Seek a long-term economic base, at project, national and international levels.
</ul><p>Given the present state of affairs, achieving these must remain beyond the visible horizon for
some time yet. Nevertheless, they offer direction in terms of focusing immediate actions on long-term
goals.
<p>Needless to say, the main priority for democratic media is to continue to create innovative,
sometimes alternative, media at grassroots level, experimenting and consolidating achievements. This is
the well-spring of a movement. The following focuses above this level, suggesting priorities for immediate
action that address, in interconnected ways, the above goals. Although necessarily presented in general
form (they require tailoring to specific circumstances), they are intended to be realistic in scope and
achievable within the foreseeable future.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Create a democratic media alliance</b></font><br>
A democratic media alliance, initially comprising an informal grouping of international NGOs then possibly
of national ones, could form the basis for a deepening of understanding within and between specific
media. Over time and based on progress, this could gradually evolve towards a specific entity,
representing in certain domains democratic media as a whole, and acting as a central point of contact and
collaboration.
<p>Such an alliance or organisation would assist progress on a number of fronts, among them:
<ul><li>It would offer an arena in which to debate the role of democratic media as a whole, and strategies
to promote them;
<li>It would facilitate networking and sharing of resources, and collaboration on ongoing issues;
<li>It could comprise a hub of information on all aspects of democratic media, both for those involved
and for others, and even undertake its own research activities;
<li>The process of formulating a specific identity could be initiated, and in the longer term, this identity
could be promoted;
<li>It would offer a single point of contact for lobbying intergovernmental and other organisations,
simplifying the logistics of developing such relationships.
</ul><p>The first steps of such an alliance would proceed on the basis of mutually beneficial, practical and
realisable goals.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Build and experiment with democratic structures</b></font><br>
Many of the above factors hinge, naturally enough, on developing democratic structures. Participative
structures are central to constructing and projecting a unique identity and to building intimate sustainable
links with people (ÔaudienceÕ ÔclientsÕ ÔusersÕ etc.). The strategic capacity to influence of any democratic
medium will be determined by its ability to mobilise people, which it turn depends on how deeply people are
committed. Such commitment also supports a major pillar of sustainable economic existence. Another
economic pillar, government funding, in turn also demands transparent and democratic structures to
achieve public legitimacy.
<p>Developing democratic structures is therefore not simply a matter of principle, but a matter of
central necessity. Creating them within the non-governmental sector, however, is not easy, and there
are few enough models of relevance. Democratic and participative structures must exist not only at
ground level, but also, and sometimes more problematically, at national and international levels. Such
structures would ensure that the centrality of grassroots realities is not lost in international actions - the
NGO world always risks, in proportion to its success, incorporation into and compromise by more
powerful structures of interest.
<p>There is an urgent task to develop and formalise participative models of community radio, of video
and television and of the other media, and to devise innovative models for national and international
organisations. Much can be learned from past experience within, and indeed outside, the media sector.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Intervene in policy fora</b></font><br>
Public policy creates both the constraints and the opportunities within which democratic media operate.
Effective intervention into policy formation is critical to the growth of the sector. National (sometimes
regional) level policy is still the most important, but the global level, via intergovernmental or multi-lateral
organisations, is increasing an influence especially in the context of neo-liberalisation.
<p>Effective lobbying requires clear, well constructed ideas, and a coherent effective voice. Nationally, this
can be assisted significantly through the various democratic media collaborating to understand the
issues, explore policy options and influence the outcome. International exchanges of information can also
be of use, comparing developments in different countries in terms of policies and lobbying strategies.
<p>At the international level, transnational alliances are essential. Most intergovernmental organisations
will listen only to international organisations, referring others to national governments. Here there are
currently major policy developments of relevance to the future of community media and access to
infrastructure and airwaves. Yet at this level, democratic media have virtually no presence. Establishing
relations with the ITU, the WTO and UNESCO would be a first step (the last recently publishing an
interesting argument, in the Report from the World Commission on Culture and Development, for a
Ôglobal commonsÕ offering free satellite radio and television signals). But activities of organisations such as
the World Bank, the IMF, OECD and G7 intertwine to influence virtually all domains including the media, with
impetus added in the context of the ÔInformation SocietyÕ. Such organisations could also be the subject of
observation, analysis and intervention.
<p>In practical terms, then, a strategy should be devised to support national lobbying and construct
vehicles for intergovernmental influence. The focus should not, however, be solely on securing greater
influence for the democratic media sector. Of equal importance is pressing to democratise structures of
governance in relation to all aspects, and at all levels, of media policy development and implementation. It
might be noted here that the democratic media sector, like the NGO sector in general, cannot perceive
itself as an alternative to democratic government. Rather it is both a means to supplement global,
national and regional governments where they are restrained and compromised, and a force to deepen
democracy within existing structures of governance.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Exploit the opportunity of liberalisation</b></font><br>
The state is also a potential source of permanent funding for democratic media and, ironically, the
process of neo-liberalisation of the media and regulations governing them offers a significant opportunity
for levering state funding through effective lobbying.
<p>In principle, a state that relies on market forces and private ownership as the principal motor for
economic development has an obligation to ensure that profits are not generated at the expense of
essential aspects of human life and dignity. Establishing the right to communicate as one such essential
aspect, and securing support for its instruments, democratic media, is of course a major struggle with
the state and private interests, a struggle rendered seemingly more difficult under neo-liberal policies.
<p>Neo-liberalisation, a term used here to denote commercialisation, privatisation, commodification of
production, and the reduction of licensing restrictions on media activity, essentially represents a
movement away from democratic control by means of political structures, towards increased private
sector power. The effect is an atomisation and stratification of the influence of people, and their
transformation into consumers. Their democratic choice is reduced to whether they purchase one
commodity or another - if they can afford either.
<p>Given the long-standing public service role of the media, such changes do not occur without
resistance. The relatively visible erosion of the social good and the Ôpublic service ethicÕ inherent in the
liberalisation process (affecting for instance television, radio, telecommunication, newspapers and even
film sectors), combined with the patent inability of its protector, the state, to renew its role from within
its own resources, creates a Ôdemocratic deficitÕ. This void can be occupied by proponents of democratic
media as a lever to secure an economic basis for the sector. In other words, the possibility is that the
'public-service ethic', hitherto occupied by a more or less benign top-down state, can now be taken by the
alternative media sector, and democratised. And a central source of legitimacy in this argument is that
democratic media are open, participative and accountable to the people. Without this, they become
simply another interest group, with no rights to any special status.
<p>Thus, for example, democratic (or community) radio may argue for state support, especially if they
decline a right to advertise; democratic video and television can demand production and transmission
facilities (already achieved in many countries); and development oriented internet use can demand local
access and support for training, equipment, and so forth, as part of universal service policies.
<p>At a global level, a similar argument can be made, although the structures are less amenable to
influence. Certainly, issues ranging from radio spectrum allocation and cross-subsidies for global universal
service (where the divisions between countries are far great than those within them) to the right to
protect cultural diversity against profit maximisation, fall victim to the global agenda of neo-liberalisation.
Counter arguments must be forcefully articulated and alternative structures proposed.
<p>Not all countries are subject to neo-liberal policies; and where they are, such an opening may not
always exist. Nevertheless, this Ôsilver liningÕ of neo-liberalisation is the kind of opportunity that a
democratic media movement must grasp as a means to build its future.  Such a campaign plays to the
strengths of the media movement, its roots in democracy; and it also underlines the value of strategic
planning, collective action, and developing an identity as a means to influence policy objectives. 
<p>Long ago, Karl Marx pointed out that capitalism transforms all before it into its own image, the image
of the commodity bought and sold for a price. The transformation of the media has taken longer than
most and they continue to resist the process - because the media are so central to societyÕs own image
and sense of identity. To surrender the media to the market is to lose a fundamental aspect of our
being. Opposition has thus been real and sustained, sometimes with the help of a state stepping in
forcefully on behalf of the people.
<p>Even in mature economies, the state is now in a weakened condition, its power-base under threat and
its legitimacy in the area of media under siege by a resurgent private sector. The New World Information
and Communication Order carried the issue to the global stage, but in the end was also defeated, partly
because it lacked roots in real, ground-level, struggles. The democratic media sector now emerges as the
alternative, or at least one alternative, which firmly reasserts the centrality of people, their dignity and
creativity. Although still in its early stages, those committed to the right to communicate, both as
creation and reception, have a responsibility and an opportunity to organise their activities beyond
immediate concerns, directing ideas and energies towards the broader context. And the opportunities to
do so are there now. This is the only way for democratic media to come in from the margins, and help
shape our future.

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Globalisation, Civil Society and Communication</b></font>
<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5>In the past, it seems that the challenge was to define and develop
strategies that would permit communication for, of and from the developing countries of the South,
which were caught in a pincer-like grip between the two poles of Western/Northern capitalism and
Soviet/Eastern Communism. Today the challenge is to come up with communication strategies that
recognise and address the vastly changed international politico-economic scenario in which the negative
consequences of financial monopolies, environmental degradation and unsustainable development are
increasingly being felt in the so-called developed countries of the North.</font>


<p>
The collapse of state communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and the subsequent
rapid increase in economic integration caused by far reaching changes in technology, telecommunications
and international capital flows (now conventionally referred to as 'globalisation') pose a serious dilemma
for those concerned with international communication. Job insecurity, social emargination, racism, rising
crime and a host of other ills are threatening communities and societies, both South and North, straddling
the gap that once existed between 'developing' and 'developed'.
<p>Existing mass media and information systems are ill equipped to inform about this phenomenon, even
if they wanted to, and are even less well placed to 'explain' how the phenomenon directly affects the
well-being of the individual - of the person - in today's rapidly deteriorating social environment.
<p>While an agreed definition of the term 'globalisation' does not yet exist, it can be said to refer to the
ever-accelerating pace of cross-border economic, social, and political interactions around the world and,
more specifically, to the unprecedented expansion of private capital, free markets and advanced
communications and production technology into virtually every corner of the globe.
<p>Central to this process are key supra-national institutions whose financial resources, global influence
and policy advice are moving poor countries and the emarginated sectors of societies in the so-called
'developed' societies of the North toward an increasingly integrated world economy.
<p>Largely controlled by the wealthy Western countries of North America, Western Europe, and Japan,
these agencies include the major multilateral development banks (MDBs), such as the World Bank and its
regional counterparts.
<p>They also include other agencies which work closely with the MDBs, including the International Monetary
Fund, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the one-year-old World Trade Organisation in Geneva.
These agencies make up what BBC economics correspondent James Morgan has referred to as the 'de
facto world government'.
<p>Together, these institutions have served - and often depict themselves - as the catalysts for
globalisation, a process based on the conviction that export- and private sector-led economic growth is
best for developing countries.
<p>To this end, they generally emphasise policies designed to attract foreign investment; promote the
development of local private sectors; liberalise trade and foreign exchange regimes; reduce inflation;
promote investments in industries for which the country has a comparative advantage in global markets;
reduce the role of government in the domestic economy; and limit the function of government to
providing basic social and health services, helping finance infrastructure construction, and establishing a
legal and regulatory framework that is transparent, equitable, predictable and efficient.
<p>At the same time, the Third World - while never a homogeneous bloc - is witnessing massive internal
schisms that threaten to dissipate the force of the common thread that runs through all societies
suffering more or less serious forms of underdevelopment.
<p>Numerous experts today are saying that the concept of the 'Third World' is dead; there are no longer
the other two worlds - the industrialised and the 'communist'. To a certain extent this is true, but it does
not contain the whole truth.
<p>What is happening at the planetary level in the few years that remain before the dawn of the 21st
century is a mushrooming of threats to humankind at the individual and social levels. The menace of
nuclear annihilation may appear to have disappeared with the end of the Cold War, but a whole series of
new threats now hangs over individuals as physical and social beings, and these threats know no
geographical or cultural boundaries. They range from environmental pollution, through the collapse of
welfare values, to the denial of basic human rights.
<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=4><b>Globalisation and civil society</b></font><br>
After almost two decades of structural adjustment policies implemented - and often enforced - around
the world, the state has been seriously weakened. Multinational capital is the dominant - and largely
unchecked - force in global economic affairs.
<p>The result is that institutions of civil society (referred to as that dimension of public life which is neither
government nor private sector, but goes well beyond the immense world of NGOs: it includes all the
socio-cultural structures of societies, in which ever increasing groups of citizens begin organising
themselves for the good of their societies at a moment in which the very concept of the 'state' is in
serious difficulty) are the only serious check on this force.
<p>If the decade of the 1980s was one in which non-governmental organisations (NGOs) expanded rapidly,
widening the scope of their activities and consolidating themselves within their respective societies, the
1990s represents a major turning point in terms of their intrinsic relevance to political activity at local,
regional and international level.
<p>In fact, the collapse of state communism in the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, and the disappearance of bipolar superpower rivalry, provided fertile ground for the
transformation of NGOs into representatives of 'civil society'. a concept that grew out of the ashes of
the 'old world order' and the hopes for a 'new world order' that would be characterised by greater social
participation in decision-making and policy implementation.
<p>To a certain extent also, the 'triumph' of one type of political system over another heralded in a new
era in which, in theory at least, the 'civil society' could begin to exert an increasingly important role as a
counterbalance to an established system of power that suddenly found itself without an opposing power
system.
<p>In a sense, what we see today are the first steps in replacing a decades-long relationship of political
bi-polarism with a new model of bipolarism at both political and societal levels. The new protagonist on
the scene is 'civil society' which is steadily developing models and paradigms for injecting new life into old
forms of relations between those who hold political power and those who do not - in a sense, creating
the framework for a new vision of the world in which the well-being of the 'person' is the hub around which
global affairs turn: global human security.
<p>The concept of global human security is based on the simple premise that the end of the Cold War may
have been seen in many quarters as a major step towards the freedom of the planet's inhabitants from
the threat of nuclear holocaust, but that peoples everywhere face more insidious threats to their
well-being (such as poverty, unemployment, lack of social integration and denial of rights) - and these
latter threats know no national or regional boundaries, they are global.
<p>Since its creation in 1964, Inter Press Service (IPS) has been working steadily to create new channels of
communication South-South and South-North. The objective has always been to provide communication
'space' to those sectors traditionally neglected by or emarginated from the mainstream information
circuits, and to involve new 'actors' in communication at national, regional and international level.
<p>In recent years, NGOs have developed in such a way that they have become important (and
increasingly major) actors, both within the societies in which they operate and in an international context.
They have characterised themselves by vitality, flexibility and adaptability, and have gained widespread
recognition for their work with the poor and the oppressed.
<p>However, despite their prominence, many NGOs are increasingly hollow. Many have become
bureaucratised to such a degree that they have no grassroots constituencies. Furthermore, several
international NGOs are basically pursuing Northern agendas. The split between Northern and Southern
NGOs has become increasingly clear in recent international conferences.
<p>Another major flaw has been a lack of communication between Northern and Southern NGOs, which
has contributed negatively to the creation of a mass movement uniting human rights groups,
environment groups, women's groups, health groups, labour unions and so on that can begin to offer
electorates real alternatives to the neo-liberal model of the multinational corporations and the World
Bank.
<p>Given adequate and appropriate communication strategies, NGOs could well be on the road of rapid
transition from small and often marginalised organisations toward a recognised role as international
players on the global scene. Development co-operation, for example, is practically unthinkable without
the participation of NGOs.
<p>At the same time, however, the rapidity of this transition poses NGOs with a number of deep
questions that must be answered in order to better fine-tune their roles and relationship in the coming
years and into the 21st century. For this, communication and participation - one of the leitmotifs of IPS's
activities - play an essential role.
<p>Through their activities, NGOs are present at all levels. Their role is becoming increasingly important in
rural and urban areas, in human rights, in women's issues, in aid to disaster areas, in non-formal
education, in environmental issues, in dissemination of information, and so on and so on. In most cases,
NGOs implement their activities for the benefit of the poorest sectors of populations.
<p>In broad terms, NGOs today have five major roles to play:
<ul><li>They are organisations working directly in the field with the problems of 'grassroots' communities
and their development prospects;
<li>They can act as 'go-betweens', transforming official government policies into concrete action at the
local 'grassroots' level;
<li>They can often act as 'surrogates' for government in areas where either the government is inert or
the local community is reluctant to recognise the 'authority' of government;
<li>They are 'catalysts' for action, putting new issues on the public agenda and pressuring governments to

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Europeans decide against Nigerian oil embargo</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<h2>British and Dutch reject Nigerian oil embargo demands </h2><p>

<b>Thursday 23 November</b><p>

Calls by international human rights campaigners for an oil embargo against Nigeria went unheeded on Tuesday, as Britain and the Netherlands vetoed attempts to impose a Europe-wide ban.<p>

Nigeria has become an international outcast after its <a href="wk46_ogoni.html">hanging of nine pro-democracy campaigners</a> on 10 November.  The nine included Ken Saro-Wiwa, leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples, which campaigned against oil pollution by the multinational company Shell in the Niger Delta.<p>

The hangings have left Nigeria diplomatically isolated, and an arms embargo has been imposed by Europe and the United States.  However, campaigners claim that only a refusal to buy oil will seriously hurt the Nigerian military government, which derives most of its income from oil exports.<p>

Shell is the largest multinational company operating in Nigeria.  While it has withdrawn from Ogoniland itself (the centre of a strong resistance movement), it continues to operate in the rest of Nigeria.  The company is Anglo-Dutch, and it is significant that these two countries protected the company's interests by refusing to impose an embargo.<p>

The decision led to criticism of Britain by other European governments, who favoured strong measures against Nigeria after the international outrage generated by the hangings.  Britain has also played down suggestions that it could freeze the UK assets of members of the Nigerian government, insisting that such measures would have to be agreed by the UN.<p>

South Africa's President Nelson Mandela was humiliated by Nigeria after his attempts at quiet diplomacy to prevent the executions of the nine failed.  He has since led the international campaign to put pressure on Nigeria's military to restore democracy in the country.  He has called on both the Europeans and the United States (which buys half Nigeria's oil) to impose an embargo.<p>
<b>
An international campaign is also being led by The Body Shop and Ogoni supporters in other countries.  In Britain, the The Body Shop and the Ogoni Community Association have issued joint demands.  These include:<p></b>

<ul><li>"The immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Chief Abiola (who is thought to have won the 1993 elections, which were annulled by the military) and MOSOP members and sympathisers held in detention.<p>

<li>Immediate release of the bodies of the nine Ogoni executed on Friday 10 November to their families for burial.<p>

<li>Immediate withdrawal of all troops in the Niger Delta.<p>

<li>Steps to return to a democratically elected government in Nigeria following the immediate resignation of the Abacha government.<p>

<li>The oil industry operating in Nigeria be made to pay fair compensation directly to the peoples adversely affected for the environmental damage caused by their oil operations in Nigeria, especially in the Niger Delta.<p>

<li>That the oil companies take steps to clean up existing pollution and that they henceforth operate to the same stringent environmental standards as in Britain, Europe and North America."<p>
</ul>
<b>
A broad coalition of several groups is also endorsing a specific set of demands for action from the international community.  These include Greenpeace International, Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, the Right Livelihood Foundation, Third World First, The Society for Threatened Peoples (Germany) and the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria.  Their demands are:<p></b>

<ul><li>"An early international embargo of all Nigerian oil and gas products.<p>

<li>The suspension of Nigeria from all international sporting bodies and events, for example the upcoming FIFA Youth World Cup.<p>

<li>The freezing of all personal assets and foreign bank accounts held by Nigerians associated with the military regime, and in particular the members of the Provisional Ruling Council who confirmed the sentences on the nine Ogoni executed last week.<p>

<li>Suspension of all non-humanitarian aid, in particular the European Union's aid under the Lome Convention and the United States AID Programme.<p>

<li>An immediate world-wide and enforced ban on the sale of lethal and non-lethal military equipment to Nigeria, to also include existing contracts yet to be fulfilled and equipment awaiting delivery.<p>

<li>Imposition of world-wide visa restrictions on all prominent Nigerians associated with the military regime, for example serving senior military officers and diplomats.<p>

<li>Assistance to the Nigerian democratic and human rights organisations to sustain the campaign to restore democracy."<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>JOURNALISM AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION<br>Johannes Botes</b></font>

<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5>Journalists often define themselves simply as reporters of conflict.
According to this notion, the role of a journalist is not to advocate or defend the actions of any
party embroiled in conflict. Nor do they think their task has anything in common with that of outside
interveners, the so-called third parties to the conflict, who may be trying to end it. The following
article explores how news coverage can affect the course of a conflict and - on occasion - positively
influence its outcome.</font>

<p>








The assumption is that a news reporter's job is merely to <i>report</i>: to describe what is
happening as accurately and vividly as possible in a few hundred words (or a few dozen, or ninety
seconds of videotape and some text). So while parties argue or fight, and third parties intervene on
one side or the other or try to mediate a settlement, most journalists see their role as neutral to
these interactions.  Whether covering a divorce, a neighbourhood dispute, or a civil war, journalists
strive to be objective and to avoid playing favourites. The task is not to help one side or the other
win. It is not to provoke or hinder outside intervention, or even to assist mediators to arrange a
settlement. The journalist's primary mission is to tell the truth about the conflict so that other
people may decide how to deal with it. <p>

	Up to a point, this perspective makes perfectly good sense. But as an approach to understanding
the dynamic relationship between media coverage of a conflict and the conflict itself, it has
limitations. Reporters always run the risk of acting as press agents for conflicting parties or
becoming advocates for outside intervention. Falling into this trap means losing one's ability to
'see' the conflict and to describe it accurately. It also means running the ultimate risk of losing
one's credibility in the eyes of the parties or the public. Still, there is no societal 'Great Wall
of China' separating journalists from the conflicts they cover. However much reporters may try to
'distance' themselves from the disputing parties, the act of reporting on any conflict influences it
in myriad, often profound, ways.<p>

	As all journalists know, their mere presence on the scene often alters the behaviour of parties
to conflict. 'The Whole World is Watching' - the chant of American antiwar demonstrators at the 1968
Democratic Convention in Chicago - is now a fact or possibility that influences conflict behaviour
around the globe. In this regard, UN observers in Bosnia have noted that the presence of journalists,
especially camera crews, have on several occasions prevented (or, perhaps, postponed) atrocities. One
also recalls how the appearance of news cameras during anti-apartheid rallies in South Africa and
Solidarity demonstrations in Poland was blamed for inciting riots for international media
consumption. Movements of oppressed people throughout the world now understand the power of the
international media to bring pressure to bear on their oppressors. For such organisations or peoples
the media play a direct role in their conflicts; for them, journalists are potential tools in their
struggle to change the power relationships between the parties.<p>

	The effects of reporting on the dynamics and outcomes of conflict are even more influential when
they are less obvious. The dramatic formula of 'A versus B' can be played out in a myriad of
variations, each producing a different effect. Simply by beginning a story with Party A striking
Party B, for example, the reporter can portray A as the aggressor, obscuring the fact that A's act
may have been a response to more subtle blows previously struck by B. The justification for a
particular story format sometimes rests on production values, such as the availability of time and
space. Presentational techniques or other media conventions can therefore influence which elements of
a conflict get highlighted or even omitted from a particular report.<p>

	Virtually every technical and editorial decision made by journalists in presenting a conflict
has potential consequences for the conflict itself. Consider the impact of the decision to treat a
particular individual or organisation as a representative of a larger party to the conflict. When the
international media recognized Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress as the primary
representatives of South Africa's Black community, for example, the ANC's position vis-a-vis its
internal and external adversaries was greatly strengthened.<p>

	Furthermore, news coverage can strongly influence the way outside parties relate to the
conflict. To take a recent example, the presence of print and broadcast journalists in besieged
Sarajevo in 1994 undoubtedly contributed to the 'tilt' towards the residents of that city, and
against their Serbian besiegers, on the part of NATO and the United States. One also recalls the
enormous impact of televised images of protesters being hurled into the air by the pressure of fire
hoses or being set upon by police dogs during the heyday of the American Civil Rights movement.
During the Vietnam War, it is generally agreed, news coverage emphasizing the appalling human costs
of that struggle eventually helped catalyze US domestic opposition to continuing it. By contrast, the
media's willingness to abide by highly restrictive rules governing journalists during the Persian
Gulf War, their inclination to feature film of 'smart bombs' and other news material supplied by
military sources, and their acceptance, overall, of the US government's version of the events and
personalities leading up to the war, helped mobilize a high level of public support for violent
intervention against Iraq.<p>

	Of course, news organisations are not all-powerful. If the Persian Gulf War had produced a large
number of casualties on the Coalition side, journalists would undoubtedly have been obliged to report
these facts as well, and support for the war might have become eroded, as happened in the case of
Vietnam. But the Gulf War illustrates the way in which parties to conflict try to 'capture' reporters
by getting them to view the conflict through partisan eyes. This happens more readily, of course,
when the conflicting parties have unequal access to the media, when one party is able to control the
flow of information, and when the events being reported take place in some distant land.<p>

	A recent illustration is the success enjoyed by Russian president Boris Yeltsin and his US
supporters in 1993 in getting American journalists to see Yeltsin's shelling of the Russian
parliament as a necessary method of saving Russia from an alleged conspiracy of 'Fascists and
Communists.' By contrast, attempts by opposing forces to mobilize the media in their favour in the
debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were less successful. In this case, the
conflict was close at hand. Both sides were able to make their voices and perspective heard; public
opinion remained divided; and Congress's decision was finally made on the basis of power-bargaining
among 'insiders.'<p>

	The power of the modern journalist, especially the television journalist, has been clearly
apparent in such conflict sites as Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda. The suffering of civilians in
these wars have forced reporters to face an ethical dilemma. Do they report the human suffering in a
detached, factual manner, or should they highlight the carnage in such a way that public pressure
might bring about outside intervention? Furthermore, if certain types of intervention (for example,
economic sanctions, the lifting of arms embargoes, or direct military intervention) have the
potential to increase human suffering, should journalists also take this into account? Invoking
traditional formulas about journalistic objectivity may not be of much use in answering such
questions. The journalist may still be forced to choose between the conflicting roles of spectator
and participant.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Journalists and conflict resolvers: similarities</b></font><br>
Bill Blakemore of ABC-TV News has frequently noted the structural similarities between the roles and
tasks of journalists and conflict resolvers. Reporters or commentators who remain independent of the
parties to conflict, and mediators who assist disputants to resolve their differences, share certain
similarities of position, function, and even attitude.<p>

	Like conflict resolvers, reporters begin by analysing the conflict in order to determine who the
parties are, what issues motivate them, what underlying problems may be generating the dispute, and
what outcomes are probable or possible. Like 'third party' mediators or facilitators, they restrain
their inclination to take sides in order to present opposing points of view fairly and accurately.
And, again like conflict resolvers, they try to recognize where a specific, debate, issue, or
controversy falls on the cycle of conflict, whether escalation or de-escalation is likely to occur,
and whether a synthesis of opposing views - an agreement capable of resolving the dispute - is
possible.<p>

	Most important, journalists are also 'third parties' to conflict, actors whose decisions, even
if they are acting as non-partisan neutrals, can strongly influence the course and outcome of a
struggle. At times, in fact, media representatives have played a direct role in helping resolve
serious conflicts. In 1962, for example, John Scali, who was at the time a correspondent assigned to
the US Department of State, became a major figure in the solution of the Cuban Missile Crisis. With
confirmed Soviet nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba and a US naval blockade around the island, the
diplomatic relationship between Moscow and Washington was so strained that face-saving back-channel
negotiations were required. At the request of a Soviet diplomat, Scali functioned as an intermediary
between the two superpowers, providing a form of 'shuttle diplomacy' that may have helped to avoid a
nuclear disaster.<p>

	Fifteen years later, the invention of satellite television provided what some consider to be the
birth of 'television diplomacy.' In 1977, Walter Cronkite spoke by satellite with Egyptian president
Anwar Sadat in Cairo and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin in Jerusalem. After permitting the two
leaders to state their positions, the anchorman played a mediator's role, asking President Sadat if
he would go to Jerusalem to meet Prime Minister Begin face-to-face. When Sadat agreed, Cronkite asked
if Begin would receive the Egyptian president, and Begin agreed. In fact, the Egyptian government had
already planned the visit, but for face-saving purposes, preferred it to appear that the idea
originated with Cronkite, a neutral outsider, rather than from the Egyptians themselves.<p>

 Nevertheless, the on-air agreement paved the way for a historic meeting in Jerusalem five days
later. This meeting led ultimately to the Camp David Accords of 1979.<p>

	While journalists do not ordinarily bring parties to conflict together either on screen or by
arranging a direct dialogue between them, they frequently provide a direct or indirect forum for the
exchange of views and consideration of various options for conflict resolution. 'Op-ed' pages often
juxtapose opposing views, and similar print forums have become standard in most urban and large
suburban newspapers. Radio talk shows regularly air conflicting opinions on a wide spectrum of
current controversies, with the program's host sometimes 'mediating' by clarifying the callers' views
and challenging the feasibility of suggestions made to resolve the dispute. Television discussion
programs and roundtables have proliferated since the early 1980s, with the host, in some cases,
functioning as a facilitator. One recalls Ted Koppel's now-famous 'Nightline' broadcast on the
American Broadcasting Company (ABC) from Jerusalem, featuring Palestinian and Israeli speakers who
were destined to play important roles in later peacemaking efforts. Koppel and 'Nightline' also have
the distinction of being the first to bring the main disputants in South Africa together for a debate
on apartheid issues, albeit electronically. This television event occurred in 1985, years before the
African National Congress and the South African government entered into formal negotiations.<p>

	All these forms of reporting generally adhere to the first principle of mediation, which is to
give all parties involved an opportunity to present their views. In the process of giving each side a
hearing, several important steps toward conflict resolution can occur: the parties may be educated
about each other's point of view; stereotypes are challenged; and initial perceptions can be
re-evaluated and clarified.<p>

	Furthermore, reporters sometimes ask questions that lead the conflicting parties to identify and
discuss the deeper interests and needs that underlie their public positions. This 'reframing' is
standard procedure in conflict resolution processes aimed at helping disputants identify the shared
problems that are causing the conflict. At times, journalists spot a problem-solving option or basis
for agreement that the parties have not considered and are able to put these ideas into circulation.
Quite often, they find themselves in the position of explaining to the public -- and sometimes to the
parties -- how a peacemaking process works. During a sensitive negotiation, journalists manage the
difficult task of keeping the public informed, while protecting the integrity of the process and the
confidentiality of sources. And during the implementation stage of public agreements, they can play
an important monitoring role by reporting on adherence to or breaches of agreement.<p>

	These points of agreement between journalists and conflict resolvers can be summarized as
follows: Both are non-partisan 'third parties' whose activities often influence the dynamics and
outcomes of a conflict even though they do not act as disputants. Both are committed to analysing
conflicts as accurately and penetratingly as possible, which means allowing the disputing parties
themselves, as well as interested outsiders, to tell their stories. Both look into the future, to the
extent possible, in order to evaluate the possibilities of conflict escalation, de-escalation, or
settlement. And both are compelled in the process of analysis to make decisions that are, in the
broadest sense, 'political' (because of their potential impact on the parties or on the outcome of
the dispute).<p>

	In the 1990s, for example, news media in the United States decided to report on a wide variety
of disputes, claims, and counterclaims in the area of sexual harassment and abuse. In effect, the
journalists put gender conflict on the map of public consciousness by 'recognizing' it in the same
way that they had previously recognized conflicts between racial and ethnic groups. In doing so,
reporters and editors have exposed themselves to the usual litany of accusations: they are inflaming
the conflict, exaggerating the issues, playing favourites, and so on. In one sense, of course, these
charges are justified: recognizing a particular form of conflict usually benefits those disadvantaged
by its prior 'invisibility.' But the genie of gender conflict cannot be put back into the bottle, nor
should it be. How accurately, sensitively, and deeply journalists analyse this difficult topic may
well influence the course of male-female relationships in America for decades to come.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Journalists and conflict resolvers: differences</b></font><br>

Although both journalists and conflict resolvers are in the business of conflict <i>analysis</i>, it
would be foolish to minimise the differences in their perspectives and situations when it comes to
conflict <i>resolution</i>. To begin with, they work for different employers. Mediators and
facilitators are responsible to the disputing parties, but journalists produce a commodity that news
organisations must sell to the reading, listening, or viewing audience and to advertisers. In the
past, this has led many news organisations to dramatize conflicts (either openly or tacitly) by
focusing on irreconcilable differences between the parties, extreme positions and inflammatory
statements, violent or threatening acts, and win-or-lose outcomes. A common assumption is that while
'conflict sells,' co-operation, or the process of resolving conflict, does not.<p>

	Furthermore, the news media ordinarily attend to conflicts only at points of high public
interest, such as dramatic escalation or de-escalation phases, unusually violent incidents, peace
treaties, or other events considered especially newsworthy. Conflict resolvers, on the other hand,
attempt to intervene both as analysts and as mediators (although they do not always succeed) before
the conflict has reached a highly intense and destructive level. For example, many companies,
universities, and other organisations managing increasingly diverse populations have implemented
systems to spot incipient group conflicts and deal with their causes before they produce explosions.
If these systems are effective, the organisations may congratulate themselves on staying 'out of the
news.' But an important story - how local institutions can prevent destructive conflict from
occurring - remains untold.<p>

	Other differences also deserve attention. Journalists reach a much larger audience than do
conflict resolvers, and the price they pay for this influence is a willingness to work within strict
constraints of time and reporting space. There are obvious limits to the extent to which they can
'specialize' in a particular conflict or do follow-up stories on 'old news.' Moreover, the financial
constraints on news organisations may lead them to conclude, for example, that while the situation in
Moldova, Brazil, or other foreign locales is quite explosive, they simply cannot afford to cover it.
And even where they do cover it, they may insist, quite reasonably, that their purpose is not to
resolve disputes between the Moldovans or Brazilians, but simply to let the public know what is going
on.<p>

	In fact, this insistence on the public's 'right to know' may put journalists in direct conflict
with mediators or other facilitators who, for many reasons, usually prefer to deal with the
conflicting parties outside the spotlight of publicity. When the reporter asks, 'How are the
negotiations going?', and the facilitator answers, 'What negotiations?', one recognizes that there
are functional differences between journalists and conflict resolvers!<p>

	Reporters are accustomed to dealing with bureaucrats, business executives, and others who have a
penchant for secrecy. One of their tasks is to keep the public informed by penetrating this
self-protective, often self-serving, wall of silence. But conflict resolvers have reasons of their
own for maintaining privacy in their work. Facilitating discussion of a serious social conflict
requires that the parties be free to make statements, take positions, and consider alternatives that
would be politically suicidal if done publicly. Problem-solving and publicity on difficult, divisive
conflicts seldom mix. An analytical conflict resolution process cannot take place where the
participants are playing to an audience or fearing its reaction. In this respect, it is interesting
to compare the quasi-public negotiations sponsored by the US government in an attempt to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the more effective private process facilitated by the Norwegians in
1993-1994. While the negotiations in Madrid and Washington became the proverbial media circus,
Norwegian facilitators acting under conditions of strict secrecy and confidentiality succeeded in
midwifing the 'Declaration of Principles' that became the basis for the Israeli withdrawal from
Jericho and the Gaza Strip in 1994.<p>

	In certain cases, peacemaking efforts can be derailed merely by revealing that they are taking
place. Indeed, there are several known instances in which a revelation that peace talks were
occurring was followed by the assassination of one or more participants. Extreme nationalists, in
particular, may consider talking with the 'enemy' to be a form of treason punishable by death. Many
journalists, informed that sensitive private talks are taking place, have chosen (at least
temporarily) to 'sit' on the story in order to give the process a chance to succeed, and, perhaps, to
save lives. But suppressing news, even for the best of reasons, carries with it other dangers.
Ultimately, how journalists reconcile their commitments to life and peace with their obligations to
employers and audiences is ultimately a very personal decision.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>New attitudes towards reporting on conflict</b></font><br>

Let us return to the basic assumption of news marketing that conflict sells, while co-operation does
not. To question this assumption does not imply that journalists should downplay conflict, avert
their eyes from the ugly facts of hatred and violence, or 'cry peace where there is no peace.' Nor
should reporters and news editors attempt to 'balance' stories of bitter conflict with news about
sweet resolution. On the contrary, by intensifying their focus on social conflicts --by covering
conflict stories with more continuity and in greater depth -- journalists can provide invaluable
services to the conflicting parties and to society.<p>

	Good reporting and news analysis should look beyond stated positions toward the interests and
needs of the parties. Such reporting assists disputants and conflict resolvers to get to the root of
the problems causing the conflict, and tells us what a conflict is really about. Reporters and
commentators can put a conflict in historical and social perspective, deepening everyone's
understanding of it. They can call attention to dangers of escalation and to opportunities for
settlement that the parties may not have recognized. And they can become part of an 'early warning
system' that identifies the underground tremors of impending conflict, thus permitting earlier
responses to it. For example, Robert D. Kaplan's analytical journalistic study in The Atlantic
Monthly (February 1994) gives early warning to citizens and policymakers about the global impact of
impending environmental disasters that the author thinks could cause serious conflict as nations
break up, borders crumble, and essential resources become scarce. Media tasks such as early warning
require that journalists pursue their legitimate interests in reporting on conflict rather than
looking for 'good news' and less disturbing or 'happier' subjects.<p>

	At the same time, though, it is worth considering a suggestion made recently by Joann Byrd,
writing as ombudsman for The Washington Post. In covering conflict stories, Byrd states, journalists
should add an 'S' for Solutions and a 'C' for Common Ground to the traditional 'five W's' formula
(Who, What, When, Where, Why). She entreats reporters to go beyond describing a conflict merely in
terms of poles of opposition. 'The search for commonality and agreement,' she argues, 'should become
a journalistic knee-jerk.'<p>

	This prescription is valid only with this proviso: that the basis for agreement between
seriously alienated parties can be determined only on the basis of thorough and sensitive analysis.
Serious conflict is most often the result of a mismatch between human needs and institutional
structures. Reporters investigating the basis for possible conflict resolution therefore need to ask
two types of question. First, what do the parties need in order to end their conflict? This may not
be the same as what they say they want, but only the disputants themselves can identify their needs.
Second, how has the system that embraces the disputing parties failed them? Discovering a basis for
agreement generally means diagnosing a system-failure and exploring the possibilities of correcting
it.<p>

	Adopting Joann Byrd's excellent suggestion, therefore, requires more than a change of attitude
on the part of journalists. It implies a search for the roots of the conflict that challenges them to
exercise their powers of analysis and imagination to the fullest. Numerous examples show this is
possible. To cite one recent instance of pathfinding conflict coverage, Tod Robberson's reports for
The Washington Post on the January, 1994 'Zapatista' rebellion in Mexico's Chiapas Province
brilliantly clarified both the causes and nature of that conflict and the system-changing measures
that will probably be necessary to resolve it. Robberson put his readers in the shoes of all the
parties to that conflict, and he managed to do so readably and dramatically, working as a reporter
and not as an academic writer. Similar examples could be multiplied; the point is that one can
succeed both as a storyteller and an analyst.<p>

	This leaves us with the question raised earlier: Can co-operation, or activities that avert
conflict by eliminating its causes, be considered marketable news? Public tastes in this regard are
more flexible and varied, perhaps, than many news organisations think. It may be the case that
stories of everyday co-operation and conflict aversion (people shovelling each other's walks during a
snowstorm, for example) will remain of minor interest to much of the reading/listening/viewing
public. 'Human interest' items seldom make front page news. But where a difficult problem faced by a
large number of people has been successfully solved by some, the level of interest in the story rises
precipitously. Where a school system implements a successful program to reduce gang conflict, this is
'news' by anion's definition. And when a new technique for resolving parent-child conflict shows
promise of working, even speculative reports on it will find an eager audience.<p>

	What some news organisations may fail to recognize is that people do not read or tune in the
news only for stimulation or 'kicks' (the classic entertainment value factors), but also to relieve
their anxieties. With general levels of fear and frustration rising throughout the industrialized
world, there is a market for stories featuring successful problem-solving and conflict resolution.
Desperate people often turn to charlatans, snake-oil salesmen, demagogues, and others who promise
quick cures for their personal and social ills. Journalists can address these needs without becoming
confidence-peddlers by describing genuine instances of conflict resolution and prevention: cases in
which conflicts that might have become vicious and destructive were averted by addressing their
causes.<p>

	The public's interest in 'How To...' remains unabated. How to build families that stay together,
schools that teach, neighbourhoods that prosper, and government institutions that serve are subjects
that should find a ready market among the anxious consumers of news. Conflict sells - but so does
conflict resolution.<p>

<b>
On sait combien l'aide au d&#233;veloppement est complexe et
sensible, surtout dans des zones d&#233;favoris&#233;es, aux
&#233;quilibres fragiles et aux contraintes fortes.  Elle a
g&#233;n&#233;r&#233; de nombreuses th&#233;ories et de multiples
strat&#233;gies, qui n'ont pas produit les effets attendus.
D'o&ugrave; des interrogations et des mises en cause.
<p>
A l'heure o&ugrave; les organismes d'aide bilat&#233;rale et
multilat&#233;rale revoient leurs orientations et leurs
interventions, nous avons demand&#233; au chef de
d&#233;l&#233;gation de la Commission europ&#233;enne en
R&#233;publique Islamique de Mauritanie de d&#233;finir la vision
communautaire qu'il fait pr&#233;valoir dans les actions de
terrain. En particulier au niveau de l'aide institutionnelle au
d&#233;veloppement qui, comme on le sait, constitue un secteur
nouveau d'intervention pour l'Union europ&#233;enne.
<p>
Est pos&#233;e ici la question essentielle de l'efficacit&#233;
de l'aide &#224; partir d'une exp&#233;rience men&#233;e
aupr&#232;s du Minist&#232;re mauritanien du Plan.</b>
<p>
Plusieurs d&#233;cennies d'aide au d&#233;veloppement, quels qu'en
soient les modes et les dispositifs, ont montr&#233; les limites
des ambitions et des espoirs. Principes fondateurs, concepts
novateurs, moyens humains et financiers n'ont men&#233; qu'&#224;
des r&#233;sultats d&#233;cevants, m&ecirc;me si des
r&#233;ussites existent &#231;a et l&#224;, que le temps doit
encore confirmer. Et pourtant, en d&#233;pit de ses faiblesses et
de ses impacts parfois ambigus, l'aide ext&#233;rieure contribue
sans nul doute au d&#233;veloppement des pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires.  Ce qui est en cause n'est pas
l'utilit&#233; mais l'efficacit&#233; de l'aide. C'est pourquoi
il est temps, rompant avec les incantations, les impr&#233;cations
ou les id&#233;es re&#231;ues, de prendre en compte la
r&#233;alit&#233; et d'agir sur le possible. Autrement dit, un
renouvellement imp&#233;ratif des approches et un changement
radical des d&#233;marches.
<p>
<a name="cri"><h3>Des critiques mises &#224; mal par la r&#233;alit&#233;</h3></a>
<p>
Dans un premier temps, l'aide institutionnelle traditionnelle a
&#233;t&#233; mise en cause, de mani&#232;re aussi
s&#233;v&#232;re qu'injustifi&#233;e. On a critiqu&#233; la
lourdeur et la complexit&#233; des interventions
macro&#233;conomiques des grandes institutions de
d&#233;veloppement comme des bailleurs bilat&#233;raux et on y a
oppos&#233; la vision micro&#233;conomique avec, pour principal
support, les organisations dites non gouvernementales.
<p>
Au fur et &#224; mesure du succ&#232;s m&#233;diatique et de la
consid&#233;ration politique accord&#233;e &#224; ces
organisations - dont l'objectif est d'agir dans un champ plus
&#233;troit et d'op&#233;rer de fa&#231;on plus rapproch&#233;e
et flexible, force a &#233;t&#233; de constater qu'elles
&#233;taient &#224; leur tour atteintes par des difficult&#233;s
existentielles. Faute de vision globale et d'approche
int&#233;gr&#233;e, elles sont conduites &#224; des actions
dispers&#233;es et sans coh&#233;sion. En outre, leur
&#233;loignement des centres d&#233;cisionnels rend leurs actions
difficilement mesurables tandis que l'absence de
r&#233;f&#233;rentiel limitent leurs interventions de fa&#231;on
importante.
<p>
Aussi ont-elles tendance &#224; d&#233;vier de leur vocation
initiale pour se transformer &#224; leur tour en macro-organisations soumises aux m&ecirc;mes contraintes que les
bailleurs de fonds dits institutionnels, mais sans en avoir les
moyens, le savoir-faire et la m&#233;moire historique
accumul&#233;s par des d&#233;cennies de pr&#233;sence
concr&#232;te.
<p>
Dans un deuxi&#232;me temps, ce sont les administrations
&#233;conomiques nationales qui ont fait l'objet de critiques
fond&#233;es mais st&#233;riles. En effet, tant que les politiques
nationales ne reposeront pas sur une forte volont&#233;
gouvernementale de les d&#233;terminer et de les faire appliquer,
les administrations seront port&#233;es &#224; l'inertie. D'autant
que les salaires y sont peu &#233;lev&#233;s, les motivations
faibles et le professionnalisme &#224; la fois restreint et
r&#233;cent. En ajoutant, &#224; leur d&#233;charge, la tendance
des intervenants ext&#233;rieurs &#224; pratiquer davantage un
syst&#232;me de substitution que de compl&#233;mentarit&#233;.
Quelles que soient les d&#233;clarations d'intention en ce
domaine, elles ne r&#233;sistent pas &#224; une lecture objective
de la r&#233;alit&#233; sur le terrain au quotidien.
<p>
L'ajustement structurel, tellement d&#233;cri&#233;, a au moins
eu le m&#233;rite d'op&#233;rer un retour &#224; l'&#233;quation
fondamentale du d&#233;veloppement, &#224; savoir qu'il ne peut
se faire que si les int&#233;ress&#233;s sont partie prenante aux
d&#233;cisions et &#224; l'organisation de leur devenir. Trop
longtemps cantonn&#233;s dans les coulisses du pouvoir, les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires du d&#233;veloppement reviennent
maintenant "au coeur" du processus d&#233;cisionnel et
op&#233;ratoire par l'interm&#233;diaire du concept
"d'internalisation", cette notion essentielle qui tend &#224;
faire pr&#233;valoir la responsabilit&#233; et l'action nationale
par rapport aux certitudes venues de l'ext&#233;rieur.
<p>
Il faut d&#232;s lors appr&#233;cier de mani&#232;re relative les
carences des administrations et les aider, par des actions
positives, &#224; retrouver leur place au sein des processus qui
conditionnent le d&#233;veloppement, que ce dernier soit conduit
de fa&#231;on dirigiste ou lib&#233;rale. Sans cette
r&#233;appropriation, trop de d&#233;cisions fondamentales
resteront le fait d'une analyse extravertie, trop d'actions
d&#233;cisives reposeront sur l'intervention exog&#232;ne, trop
d'interactions strat&#233;giques &#233;chapperont au "centre"
coup&#233; de sa "p&#233;riph&#233;rie", pourtant objet de toute
son attention.
<p>
Sur de telles pr&#233;misses, il devient &#233;vident qu'un
&#233;l&#233;ment incontournable du processus de
d&#233;veloppement doit &ecirc;tre le facteur institutionnel dont
l'&#233;l&#233;ment-cl&#233; est et sera l'Administration.
<p>
<a name="ins"><h3>Des insuffisances corrobor&#233;es par les r&#233;sultats</h3></a>
<p>
C'est en constatant les difficult&#233;s des Administrations
&#233;conomiques centrales &#224; d&#233;finir et &#224; mettre
en oeuvre des politiques et des strat&#233;gies de
d&#233;veloppement que certains bailleurs de fonds ont pens&#233;
trouver des solutions appropri&#233;es pour leur fournir un appui.
Cette aide s'est exerc&#233;e dans diff&#233;rentes directions et
sous diverses formes : 
<ul>
<li>expertises ext&#233;rieures venant diagnostiquer des situations
et proposer des r&#233;organisations structurelles ou des
am&#233;liorations fonctionnelles ;
<li>formations ext&#233;rieures visant le renforcement de la
professionnalisation et la technicit&#233; de l'encadrement ;
<li>financements de moyens mat&#233;riels et/ou de soutien des
charges de fonctionnement;
<li>cr&#233;ation d'entit&#233;s supppl&#233;tives de coordination,
programmation ou suivi ; et, peut-&ecirc;tre surtout,
<li>assistance technique pour faciliter la mise en oeuvre.
</ul>
<p>
S'il serait excessif de nier tout impact b&#233;n&#233;fique de
telles aides, il n'en serait pas moins irr&#233;aliste de conclure
&#224; leur pertinence en termes d'internalisation car elles sont
loin d'avoir eu les effets que l'on aurait pu en attendre. En
outre, dans un temps de raret&#233; accrue, o&ugrave; il est
indispensable que les Administrations nationales valorisent au
mieux les aides obtenues, il n'est pas certain qu'elles soient les
plus appropri&#233;es &#224; obtenir les r&#233;sultats
escompt&#233;s. Trop souvent envisag&#233;es &#224; la h&#226;te
sans r&#233;elle r&#233;flexion, visant surtout &#224; pallier des
d&#233;ficits quantitatifs en hommes ou en mat&#233;riels, ces
appuis se sont r&#233;v&#233;l&#233;s &ecirc;tre dans leur quasi-totalit&#233; des assistances de substitution ou de compensation.
Parall&#232;lement, lorsque le choix s'est port&#233; sur des
appuis plus structurels, l'aide s'est traduite par un foisonnement
de cellules autonomes fonctionnant en p&#233;riph&#233;rie ou en-dehors des structures nationales, au motif de rem&#233;dier &#224;
leur rigidit&#233; ou pour ne pas &ecirc;tre p&#233;nalis&#233;es
par leurs dysfonctionnements. Rarement coordonn&#233;es et
suivies, ces aides n'ont gu&#232;re aid&#233; &#224; r&#233;soudre
les probl&#232;mes de fond, quand elles n'ont pas contribu&#233;
&#224; en cr&#233;er de suppl&#233;mentaires par le
d&#233;sengagement qui r&#233;sulte, en g&#233;n&#233;ral, de tels
processus de placage.
<p>
Parmi les principales insuffisances administratives, chacun se
pla&icirc;t &#224; noter les faibles capacit&#233;s de penser, de
faire et d'agir des entit&#233;s, en raison d'insuffisances de
niveau, de technicit&#233;, de m&#233;thode, d'organisation et
d'exp&#233;rience de leurs effectifs. Si ce constat est pertinent,
en tout ou en partie, il devient &#233;vident que les appuis
institutionnels mis en oeuvre pour y rem&#233;dier n'ont pas eu
les effets escompt&#233;s dans la mesure o&ugrave; ils n'ont pas
donn&#233; lieu &#224; une "appropriation" par ceux auxquels ils
&#233;taient destin&#233;s, soit qu'ils n'ont pu les assimiler ou
y adh&#233;rer.
<p>
<a name="sol"><h3>Des solutions induites par les constats</h3></a>
<p>
Ce constat rapide conduit &#224; proposer d'autres solutions plus
productives d'effets, mais, d'abord et surtout, plus
"internalis&#233;es". M&ecirc;me si l'on pourrait douter, face
&#224; cette accumulation de pesanteurs, de la possibilit&#233;
de "changer de cap" et de redresser r&#233;ellement le cours des
choses, des approches et des d&#233;marches r&#233;centes, mais
diff&#233;rentes, sugg&#232;rent qu'il est faisable - au prix
d'une remise en cause compl&#232;te de nos certitudes -, de
proposer une strat&#233;gie novatrice en mati&#232;re d'aide au
d&#233;veloppement institutionnel, d&#232;s lors qu'elle repose
sur une m&#233;thodologie permettant la structuration des appuis
pour autoriser l'appropriation des proc&#233;d&#233;s par les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires finaux. La r&#233;ussite d'une nouvelle
approche d&#233;pend largement des r&#233;ponses que l'on donnera
&#224; trois questions essentielles : quoi faire, pourquoi le
faire, comment le faire ?
<p>
Le "quoi faire" ou l'objet, c'est le domaine de l'identification.
Dans nombre de cas, faute de temps, le probl&#232;me n'est
m&ecirc;me pas &#233;nonc&#233;.  En fait, les structures de
l'Etat, d&#233;pendantes tant de la politique int&#233;rieure que
de l'ext&#233;rieur (vis&#233;es propres des donateurs) ne peuvent
r&#233;pondre aux d&#233;fis. Il faudra donc poser le diagnostic
en termes de rem&#232;des aux insuffisances de savoir-faire et de
savoir-agir dans les principaux axes de r&#233;flexion :
conception - formulation, organisation - gestion, entretien -
maintenance, suivi - &#233;valuation...
<p>
Le "pourquoi faire" ou la finalit&#233;, sera &#224;
l'&#233;vidence le domaine de la justification. Il doit &ecirc;tre
clair, pour chaque intervenant, qu'il s'agit de sortir de la
d&#233;pendance larv&#233;e et de l'assistanat pernicieux, en
privil&#233;giant le d&#233;veloppement d'une capacit&#233; de
r&#233;flexion-n&#233;gociation autonome, la r&#233;alisation de
produits de qualit&#233; &#224; la fois en quantit&#233; et en
d&#233;lai, le renforcement de la comp&#233;tence - initiative -
responsabilit&#233; des agents de l'Etat, compris au sens large.
<p>
Le "comment faire" rel&#232;vera du domaine de la
concr&#233;tisation de l'appui. Se basant sur la notion
essentielle de "faire-faire" dans une logique fonctionnelle de
"bureau d'&#233;tude" proscrivant d&#233;finitivement les notions
de substitution et de compensation, cette conception entend
assurer d&#233;sormais la r&#233;tribution des produits finaux au
lieu de servir aux acquisitions et consommations
consid&#233;r&#233;es comme n&#233;cessaires pour l'obtention de
ces m&ecirc;mes produits. Elle devra permettre de "faire
fonctionner" les structures existantes pour qu'elles
s'am&#233;liorent et se consolident avant toute modification ou
tout d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
De m&ecirc;me, cette conception entend remplacer la traditionnelle
assistance technique substitutive par une assistance
accompagnatrice du processus d'internalisation et d'appropriation,
gr&#226;ce &#224; une approche "d'apprentissage" effectif des
m&#233;thodes et techniques par les agents. L'&#233;l&#233;ment
majeur et entra&icirc;nant consistera alors &#224; investir sur
"les hommes que l'on a" en les pla&#231;ant  dans un premier temps
"aux postes qu'ils peuvent occuper" pour ensuite "mettre les
hommes qu'il faut aux postes qu'il faut", ce qui ne pourra se
faire qu'&#224; la suite d'une gestion rationnelle et dynamique
des ressources humaines qui prendra un certain temps.
<p>
Rapidement et globalement d&#233;crits, les &#233;l&#233;ments ci-dessus veulent montrer que le renouvellement de l'approche
"soutien institutionnel" consisterait fondamentalement &#224; ce
que les interventions aient lieu en vue de r&#233;sultats
tangibles, r&#233;sum&#233; en un ma&icirc;tre-mot "le faire
faire" pour l'internalisation des politiques dans les structures
et pour l'appropriation des proc&#233;d&#233;s par les
op&#233;rateurs, sur base de transparence, de contrepartie et de
responsabilisation.
<p>
<a name="sou"><h3>Un soutien d'autod&#233;veloppement</h3></a>
<p>
Ce soutien a pour ambition de permettre aux Administrations d'un
pays d'augmenter leurs capacit&#233;s propres de
d&#233;termination et de gestion de leur devenir, en attendant
qu'elles aient les moyens budg&#233;taires de les assumer et
qu'elles aient pu proc&#233;der &#224; une refonte souvent
indispensable du statut de la fonction publique. Ce soutien ne
peut donc se concr&#233;tiser que par des concours ext&#233;rieurs
temporaires et cibl&#233;s.  Pour &ecirc;tre coh&#233;rente et
efficace, il va sans dire qu'une telle politique passe non
seulement par l'&#233;tablissement d'un sch&#233;ma directeur de
r&#233;f&#233;rence, mais aussi par la d&#233;finition d'un
programme d'actions sp&#233;cifiant contenu, &#233;ch&#233;ances,
mesures d'accompagnement et moyens budg&#233;taires.
<p>
Au niveau du principe, il s'agira de prendre davantage en compte
les capacit&#233;s et les difficult&#233;s de l'Administration
pour absorber les nouvelles charges d'animation-coordination
r&#233;sultant de l'&#233;volution de ses missions ainsi que les
co&ucirc;ts suppl&#233;mentaires induits par les
am&#233;liorations recherch&#233;es. Au niveau du pilotage, pour
renforcer les impacts et pr&#233;venir les dysfonctionnements,
l'appui devra se r&#233;aliser dans un cadre coordonn&#233;,
l'initiative restant au pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire et ses
partenaires ne participant qu'au suivi et &#224;
l'&#233;valuation. Au niveau de l'appui, les volets favorisant le
d&#233;veloppement des capacit&#233;s nationales en termes de 
"savoir-faire" et de "savoir-agir" seront privil&#233;gi&#233;s.
Au niveau de l'intervention, on agira en premier lieu sur les
administrations &#233;conomiques majeures de mani&#232;re &#224;
assurer une meilleure r&#233;gulation de l'&#233;conomie, un
cadrage plus coh&#233;rent au d&#233;veloppement et une
ma&icirc;trise accrue des projets.
<p>
<a name="app"><h3>Un appui d'autovalorisation</h3></a>
<p>
Le fonctionnement des actions men&#233;es en logique "bureau
d'&#233;tudes",- c'est-&#224;-dire r&#233;alisation du service ou
du produit -, aura pour cons&#233;quence de responsabiliser
l'entit&#233; b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire au niveau de sa production
tant en qualit&#233; qu'en quantit&#233;. Elle l'am&#232;nera au
respect de ses engagements pour pouvoir continuer &#224;
b&#233;n&#233;ficier de l'aide institutionnelle, par crainte de
se trouver en rupture de "fonds de roulement" pour d&#233;faut de
production puisque l'avance initiale sera remboursable au fur et
&#224; mesure de l'ex&#233;cution du plan de charge. A contrario
de la situation actuelle, l'entit&#233; sera libre, &#224; partir
du r&#232;glement de ses prestations, d'affecter les ressources
d&#233;gag&#233;es o&ugrave; bon lui semble, &#233;vitant ainsi
les contr&ocirc;les par le donateur mais sans que ceci supprime
l'obligation de tenir une comptabilit&#233; r&#233;guli&#232;re.
Par ailleurs, sur base du  plan de charge &#233;tabli dans un
horizon pluriannuel, l'entit&#233; pr&#233;voira un programme de
travail annuel apr&#232;s identification des besoins en accord
avec le commanditaire pour tenir compte des &#233;volutions et
permettre d'&#233;ventuels recentrages. Enfin, une &#233;valuation
ext&#233;rieure ind&#233;pendante est &#224; pr&#233;voir &#224;
mi-parcours pour des reciblages d'allocation ou des corrections
d'emploi en cas de d&#233;rive ou dysfonctionnement. En fin de
projet, un bilan sera &#233;tabli d'o&ugrave; l'on pourra juger
de l'utilit&#233; de reconduction.
<p>
<a name="acc"><h3>Un accompagnement d'autostructuration</h3></a>
<p>
Il s'effectuera au travers d'une assistance technique de terrain
aux mission red&#233;finies et qui aura &#224; assumer une
obligation de r&#233;sultat. Dans ce cadre, elle aura
d&#233;sormais &#224; contribuer :
<ul>
<li>&#224; l'am&#233;lioration de l'interface donateur-administration en termes d'information et de conseil,
<li>&#224; l'internalisation des proc&#233;dures par les structures
devant permettre &#224; ces derni&#232;res de se les approprier
par le biais de l'ing&#233;ni&#233;rie associant l'encadrement en
termes d'organisation et de proc&#233;dures,
<li>&#224; la valorisation des ressources humaines en
comp&#233;tence et en responsabilit&#233; sous forme d'une
"formation-action" individuelle et collective.
</ul>
<p>
La d&#233;marche innovante "formation-action" consiste en un 
entra&icirc;nement des agents sur des "savoir-faire" et des
"savoir-agir" exig&#233;s par leurs fonctions au sein de leur
entit&#233; et alors qu'ils sont en situation d'activit&#233;, par
des conseils pratiques en alternance  avec des apprentissages
individuels et collectifs sur base d'une progression &#233;tablie
avec le responsable de l'entit&#233; et &#224; partir de cas
concrets.
<p>
La "formation-action" vise &#224; d&#233;velopper &#224; la fois
des "savoir-faire professionnels" (techniques de formulation et
d'identification, de suivi et d'&#233;valuation, m&#233;thodes de
saisie et de traitement) et des "savoir-agir comportementaux" en
termes de communication, animation, n&#233;gociation.
<p>
Le principe m&ecirc;me de cette d&#233;marche devra
privil&#233;gier une assistance technique au profil
d'entra&icirc;neur (comme celui d'une &#233;quipe sportive)
agissant &#233;galement comme moniteur individuel et animateur de
structure, capable de professionnaliser et de responsabiliser les
agents dont elle aura, au d&#233;part, pris l'engagement
d'atteindre les objectifs.
<p>
Cela induit, &#224; l'&#233;vidence, la n&#233;cessit&#233; de
recentrer les profils de l'assistance technique qui devra
d&#233;sormais &ecirc;tre :
<ul>
<li>avant tout tourn&#233;e vers la r&#233;flexion strat&#233;gique,
l'organisation proc&#233;durielle et structurelle,le conseil
pratique ;
<li>davantage diversifi&#233;e en comp&#233;tences horizontales pour
couvrir divers champs d'intervention en d&#233;veloppant une
ing&#233;ni&#233;rie active d'application utile aux entit&#233;s
;
<li>plus ax&#233;e sur le transfert effectif de "savoir-faire" et
de "savoir-agir" reposant sur l'apprentissage &#224; la
ma&icirc;trise du poste et de la fonction ;
<li>mieux cibl&#233;e en notori&#233;t&#233;, maturit&#233; et
adaptabilit&#233;, pour asseoir sa cr&#233;dibilit&#233;.
</ul>
<p>
Enfin, la gestion de cette "nouvelle" assistance technique
commande :
<ul>
<li>un recrutement plus s&#233;lectif et un suivi plus
rapproch&#233; au niveau des r&#233;sultats obtenus ;
<li>une meilleure d&#233;finition initiale de la
position/rattachement vis-&#224;-vis de l'Administration et de la
D&#233;l&#233;gation ;
<li>une r&#233;elle politique de constitution, de valorisation et
de renouvellement du gisement ;
<li>une gestion plus flexible et plus prospective de mise &#224;
dispostion.
</ul>
<p>
En guise de conclusion, l'id&#233;e centrale de cette novation est
d'aider les pays &#224; s'aider eux-m&ecirc;mes. Pour y parvenir,
il ne suffit pas de renouveler le cadre ou de redistribuer les
r&ocirc;les, il faut aussi modifier les r&#232;gles et l'approche.
Cela sera d'autant plus structurant que la r&#233;flexion
pr&#233;c&#232;dera l'action, que les finalit&#233;s respecteront
les r&#233;alit&#233;s, que les objectifs tiendront compte des
contraintes, que les op&#233;rateurs seront motiv&#233;s et que
les d&#233;cideurs assumeront leurs responsabilit&#233;s.
<p>
L'analyse et les propositions &#233;nonc&#233;es ici
proc&#232;dent d'une exp&#233;rience en cours men&#233;e
aupr&#232;s du Minist&#232;re mauritanien du Plan. Les premiers
r&#233;sultats &#224; mi-parcours, pour n'&ecirc;tre pas
d&#233;finitifs, sont suffisamment concluants pour pr&#233;senter
les bases conceptuelles qui ont sous-tendu l'approche et
guid&#233; la mise en oeuvre de la d&#233;marche que nous nous
proposons d'ailleurs d'approfondir dans le cadre d'une action plus
large et plus g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e "d'institution building".

<I>L'aide au d&eacute;veloppement demaure indispensable pour de nombreux
pays pauvres. Au moment o&ugrave; de nouvelles missions lui sont
assign&eacute;es et o&ugrave; les fonds allou&eacute;s stagnent,
il devient primordial d'am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute; de
la coop&eacute;ration.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Depuis quelques ann&eacute;es, l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
est remise en question. Le bilan de quarante ans de coop&eacute;ration
est en effet mitig&eacute;. D'un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, il est incontestable
que des progr&egrave;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s
&agrave; l'aune d'indicateurs de d&eacute;veloppement social tels
que la mortalit&eacute; infantile ou l'alphab&eacute;tisation.
De l'autre, ces progr&egrave;s demeurent insuffisants, beaucoup
trop lents et in&eacute;galement r&eacute;partis. En outre, de
nouveaux probl&egrave;mes sont apparus, li&eacute;s notamment
&agrave; la d&eacute;gradation de l'environnement naturel et &agrave;
un mode de d&eacute;veloppement exacerbant les in&eacute;galit&eacute;s.
Les populations pauvres sont les premi&egrave;res &agrave; en
subir les effets n&eacute;gatifs. D'o&ugrave; des d&eacute;sillusions
quant &agrave; l'efficacit&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration. A
ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne s'ajoute la crise des finances publiques
de nombreux pays industrialis&eacute;s qui entra&icirc;ne, &agrave;
l'&eacute;chelle mondiale, un recul des ressources consacr&eacute;es
&agrave; l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement (APD) par les
pays de l'Organisation de coop&eacute;ration et de d&eacute;veloppement
&eacute;conomiques (OCDE). L'APD a ainsi enregistr&eacute; en
1994 son plus bas niveau depuis 1973. Elle ne repr&eacute;sente
que 0,3 % du produit national brut, bien loin de l'objectif affich&eacute;
de 0,7 %.
<P>
Paradoxalement, c'est dans ce climat de scepticisme et de stagnation
des ressources financi&egrave;res que de nouvelles t&acirc;ches
sont assign&eacute;es &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration : promotion
du d&eacute;veloppement durable, soutien de la d&eacute;mocratisation,
lutte contre la drogue, reconversion &eacute;conomique des pays
anciennement communistes, croissance de l'aide humanitaire, etc.
Accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&eacute; des politiques de coop&eacute;ration
devient donc une exigence fondamentale.
<P>
<H3>Am&eacute;liorer la coh&eacute;rence</H3>
<P>
En premier lieu, il s'agit de recentrer l'aide sur son objectif
de d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et social et d'&eacute;viter
son d&eacute;tournement vers d'autres fins. En renon&ccedil;ant
&agrave; la pratique de l'aide li&eacute;e ou &agrave; l'emploi
inconsid&eacute;r&eacute; de personnel expatri&eacute;, les effets
positifs de la coop&eacute;ration pourraient &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;rablement
accrus. Le renforcement des institutions nationales et locales,
publiques et priv&eacute;es, qui contribuent au d&eacute;veloppement,
devrait &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre une priorit&eacute;. Le biais
anti-&eacute;tatique des programmes d'ajustement structurel a
trop souvent affaibli un secteur public dont la mission doit certes
&ecirc;tre red&eacute;finie, mais qui ne doit pas pour autant
perdre sa capacit&eacute; d'&eacute;laborer et de mettre en oeuvre
une strat&eacute;gie de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
En second lieu, il ne faut pas tenir compte uniquement de l'effet
des programmes d'aide sur le d&eacute;veloppement, mais de l'impact
de l'ensemble des relations des pays industriels avec les pays
du Sud. En effet, les relations Nord/Sud se diversifient et deviennent
de plus en plus complexes. La plupart des minist&egrave;res des
pays industrialis&eacute;s traitent des dossiers concernant les
pays en d&eacute;veloppement (PED). Aux traditionnelles questions
financi&egrave;res et commerciales se sont ajout&eacute;s les
probl&egrave;mes d'environnement, de migrations, de s&eacute;curit&eacute;,
d'exportations d'armes, de drogue, des nouvelles technologies
de communication, de fuite des capitaux, qui ont tous une dimension
Nord/Sud. Aussi le Comit&eacute; d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
(Cad) de l'OCDE demande-t-il &agrave; ses membres d'am&eacute;liorer
la coh&eacute;rence de leurs politiques. Le d&eacute;fi consiste
&agrave; s'assurer que les diverses politiques se compl&egrave;tent
pour favoriser le d&eacute;veloppement des PED. La strat&eacute;gie
d'int&eacute;gration dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale constitue
un premier exemple d'incoh&eacute;rence. Estimant que cette politique
favoriserait la croissance &eacute;conomique des PED, les pays
industrialis&eacute;s les encouragent en effet fortement &agrave;
accro&icirc;tre et diversifier leurs exportations. Ces m&ecirc;mes
pays, cependant, adoptent des mesures protectionnistes pour emp&ecirc;cher
les produits du Sud (textiles notamment) d'acc&eacute;der &agrave;
leurs march&eacute;s.
<P>
Par ailleurs, certaines organisations internationales (notamment
le Fonds mon&eacute;taire international) dans lesquelles les pays
industrialis&eacute;s exercent une grande influence demandent
aux PED de r&eacute;duire leurs d&eacute;penses militaires afin
de combler le d&eacute;ficit des finances publiques et de r&eacute;duire
l'ins&eacute;curit&eacute; mondiale. Et pourtant, parall&egrave;lement
&agrave; cette exigence, certains pays industriels intensifient
leurs efforts pour exporter des armes vers les PED.
<P>
La coh&eacute;rence des politiques vis-&agrave;-vis des pays du
Sud est essentielle pour garantir une certaine cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;
aux pays industriels. Ceux-ci dispensent des conseils, conditionnent
les transferts de ressources financi&egrave;res, interviennent
dans la formulation des politiques &eacute;conomiques et la mise
en oeuvre de la bonne gestion des affaires publiques (<I>good
governance</I>). Mais trop souvent, le d&eacute;calage entre le
discours et les actes an&eacute;antit le cr&eacute;dit moral des
donneurs de conseil.
<P>
<H3>Volont&eacute; politique forte</H3>
<P>
Le gouvernement suisse a &eacute;t&eacute; l'un des premiers &agrave;
r&eacute;pondre &agrave; l'appel de l'OCDE pour plus de coh&eacute;rence.
En mars 1994, il adopte un rapport &#171;Lignes directrices Nord/Sud&#187;
qui souligne que &#171;<I>les dichotomies traditionnelles entre
politique de l'environnement et politique &eacute;conomique, entre
politique commerciale et politique de coop&eacute;ration pour
le d&eacute;veloppement, entre politique int&eacute;rieure et
politique ext&eacute;rieure ne permettent plus de r&eacute;pondre
aux probl&egrave;mes actuels. Ce qu'il faut, c'est formuler une
politique coh&eacute;rente envers le Sud. Cela revient &agrave;
montrer les contradictions &eacute;ventuelles entre les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
nationaux &agrave; court terme et les buts de la politique suisse
de d&eacute;veloppement, puis &agrave; les int&eacute;grer de
fa&ccedil;on aussi transparente que possible dans les processus
de d&eacute;cision politique</I>&#187;.
<P>
&Eacute;valuer la port&eacute;e de cette d&eacute;marche est pr&eacute;matur&eacute;,
mais on peut d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; affirmer qu'elle impose
la cr&eacute;ation de m&eacute;canismes permettant de mettre sur
table et de soumettre &agrave; un arbitrage politique des questions
qu'il &eacute;tait jusque-l&agrave; difficile d'aborder de fa&ccedil;on
structur&eacute;e, comme les liens entre le respect des droits
de l'Homme et les &eacute;changes commerciaux. Les contradictions
ne seront pas n&eacute;cessairement r&eacute;solues, mais au moins
les d&eacute;cisions seront-elles prises en connaissance de cause.
Ce n'est qu'un premier pas, mais les plus longs voyages ne commencent-ils
pas ainsi ?

<h2>BROADCASTING  ABOUT AFRICA</h2>
<b>The 1994 One World Broadcasting Trust Conference</b><br>

<p>
<br><b>Chair</b><br>	
	I am very pleased to be one of the patrons of the One World Broadcasting Trust. This Session brings together as I am sure you realise from looking at the Programme a mixture of journalists and broadcasters based in radio and television and in reference to one of the things that was said in the last about us not being listened to, I would just like to say that Ron Foster the Chief Press Officer of the ADA is here and has been loyally listening all day, although he was presumably trying to stand up! We thank him very much for coming and it's very nice to know that there is at least somebody from our government here listening.<p>

	I will introduce the four speakers as they come to speak. The first speaker if Michael Holman of The Financial Times. I am sure that anybody in this room who has anything to do with media and Africa knows about Michael who is absolutely the doyan of the press corps on Africa and I was extremely keen to have him here, particularly because he almost never speaks in public, it's extremely hard to track him and we are very privileged to have got him to come, but also because I thought it was important to make the point that most people here are concerned with broadcasting rather than with the written media and I think one of the things that perhaps doesn't come out incredibly clearly to broadcasters, or at least very openly, is how circular the media is and how very dependent broadcasters are on people who work in the written word. It happens over and over again that people ring Michael or my office or other people who write on Africa saying, "Having seen what you wrote, I've got a brilliant idea for a television programme, or a radio programme, could you just help me by giving me 25 contacts" and of course because we are very good natured we always do! Very often the programmes don't happen. But anyway it is for that reason of the circularity which I think is a really important thing to take on board that I wanted Michael to come this afternoon and I am very very happy to welcome him, and he will be our first, very brief speaker.
<p>
<b>
Michael Holman</b><br>It's hard to live down an introduction like that, but I'll do my best!  I am extremely apprehensive at the prospect that is before me and I loathe appearing on occasions like this, partly because I know there is a petty powerful element of hostility to the role of the western media in Africa and partly because I am more vulnerable than most because I work for that organ of the capitalistic establishment, The Financial Times.  I also bear in mind the comment made by a rather nasty African missionary in Africa who wandered round the Continent towards the end of the last century and he said something that was really salutary and I try to bear in mind myself, he said: "In Africa one is tempted far too often to speak one's mind, forgetful that you must mind how you speak".  So I'll try to remember this, and I will also offer one or two pieces of advice about she comes to sum up. I have always found it useful on these occasions when somebody had been talking a combination of nonsense and provocative rot, to say: "It eases the tension if you call somebody 'sincere'.  So you say, "We do not doubt Mr .................sincerity." What this actually means is that we must accept the misguided man actually believes the opinionated nonsense that he has just dished up!  The other example is passionate ie: "We were struck by the passionate way in which he expressed himself". Now what this really means is that we don't agree with a word of what he said.  One final example is:  "Clearly Mr. Holman has a right to his views."  That means "we wish we hadn't invited him"!  I am not going to apologise for the role of the western media and the print writers in particular in Africa, because I think that over the past few years they have done a remarkable job. Several people who have several times been in the front line, a number of people have indeed lost their lives, and I don't know of any of my colleagues who don't at the end of the day look back over the events that they have covered and the events of the past few years and search their consciences about whether they have done the job effectively and adequately. Behind the bragging, behind the inflated egos, without exception, they are a group of men and women who have a very profound concerns about the way they do their job. Over the past 15 years I think in some respects it has become more difficult. Africa has become marginalised. The job of getting Africa into the paper has become more and more difficult. The marginalisation takes several forms I think:  it's the disengagement of the West from Africa, it's the stagnation in Africa's share of world trade, about 3%, it's the stagnant share of foreign direct investment of about 1% and we are reaching a point where I think there is a danger, there is a belief that we can bring sense in ailing marginalised Africa, and the tendency of the coverage is to look upon Africa as an object of compassion. I think one of the first things that we journalists have got to do is make the point that Africa is of concern to the West out of our own self-interest.  I think that an ailing Africa, to put it crudely, would poison the West. That a sick Africa will infect the West. We see the rise of drug smuggling through centres like Nasaka and Lagos. We are going to see I suspect the rise of Moslem extremism in Africa. We are going to face the loss of genetic material which is of immense value to the world - one example is the rosy periwinkle from Madagascar, which is used in treatment of children's lukemia. I think what we've got to put across is that the self-interest of our children in the West is as much of a concern to us as the compassionate motivation for Africa's children themselves.
	The other difficulty that I find in covering Africa is the callibre of the African opposition, the democratisation movement of the past few years has frankly proved profoundly disappointing. I was in Zambia just a couple of weeks ago and the opposition there is disintegrated and fragmented along ethnic, regional and personality lines, and one can't avoid coming to the conclusion that there are profound constitutional issues which Africa has failed to address, including the problem of the ethnicity.
	Another problem that I think is of enormous worry to all of us who cover Africa, is Africa's failure to speak out in its own cause. How many times I go to Conferences which involve raising funds for Africa or promoting Africa's interests and there are no representatives from African governments. It seems to me outrageous that Africa has failed to raise funds in its own cause. Why doesn't an African President for example sponsor a football team at Wembley between an African Eleven and a Great Britain Eleven to raise money for Africa itself.  Why is it that so much of the campaigning on the part of Africa is done by Mazoos as we call them in Zimbabwe and not by Africans themselves. Where's the lobbying on the part of Africa, where are the people who come to the journalists from African governments and say "Come and see our predicament".  Where are the governments who provide the sympathetic framework with which to address their problems.  I have just to day been dealing with OXFAM which is facing the threat of expulsion from Zimbabwe because of a critical report which was published about the Health sector in Zimbabwe. Add to this the trials and tribulations, still to this day of getting visas. Somebody I believe earlier on this morning was talking about the problems of covering Nigeria and the failure of the Western media to bring to the attention of the world their country's desperate predicament. Try getting a visa to go to Nigeria. It, for many of us, is almost impossible. I happen to have one, so I am excluding myself from this difficulty, but so many of my colleagues come in to me saying "we cannot get access to the countries concerned".  So, at the end of the day the difficulties of reporting Africa are becoming greater and greater, and I think that those in the audience who feel that we are doing a bad job might look upon our position with somewhat more sympathy and somewhat more understanding, and I look forward to fielding the tomatoes when your chance comes.
<p>

<b>Chair</b><br>	Our next speaker is <a name=hilsum>Lindsey Hilsum </a>who is both a writer for The Guardian and The Observer. She is a freelance and she also does radio and I think probably some BBC television work.  Lindsey has for about ten years specialised in East Africa. She was at one point based in Nairobi and I think many of you will know of her very distinguished work from Burundi, particularly in the early part of the crisis when nobody else wanted to write about it and certainly nobody wanted to have it on their airwaves or in their papers, and Lindsey was responsible for really pushing that story in a very sophisticated and very deep way, and we at The Guardian were particularly pleased to have her work for us.

<p>
<b>Lindsey Hilsum</b><br>	
Thank you Victoria.  I happened to be in Kigali when the violence started on April 5th. I was in a house where there was a night guard in a scullery and his name was Evarist. He was a Tutsi - and I knew he was a Tutsi because his employer told me he was a Tutsi, and because he was quite tall and he had a thin nose, and I was therefore very worried about him because it became clear very early on that Tutsis were being targeted. <br>
 
I didn't want to leave the house because I was afraid that if I left the house that might increase the chances that a gang of militia would come in and kill Evarist.  So that was very difficult. In the end I did leave the house and I left Evarist and for a long time I didn't know what had happened to him. <br>
Now some weeks more than a month later I was in Zaire and I was in the office of the Aid Agency which owned the house where I had stayed in Kigali, and a voice said, "Bonjour, Madame" and I turned round and it was Evarist, and I was thrilled as you can imagine. <br> 
I thought what the hell is Evarist doing here, everyone here is a Hutu and he's a Tutsi and I finally asked the right question. Instead of asking, "Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?" which I had asked before, knowing he was Tutsi and not getting a clear answer, I asked the question, "On your identify card does it say Hutu or Tutsi?" <br>  
He said, "It says, Hutu". <br> 
So then I knew he was a Hutu, or he was a Tutsi who had managed to get an identity card which said Hutu.  Oh, I thought, I didn't need to worry about him in the way I did when I was in Kigali, but anyway he survived, that's the main thing.  <br>
And then a couple of weeks ago I got a phone call from somebody who knows Evarist and she said "I don't know how I am going to tell you this, Lindsey, but it now looks as if Evarist is implicated in the killings and that he was involved and that he wasn't a potential victim, he may have been a murderer". <br> 
Now I tell that story not because it distresses me, although of course it does, but because it is an example of how the truth slips and it's an example of how easy it is to make assumptions and get it all wrong, and I think that is truer in Africa than in most other places where I have worked because if you ask the wrong questions, or you come in with the wrong assumptions you will get it all wrong, right from the beginning.<br>
	Now I do cover wars, coups and famines more than anything else and I am not going to apologise for that. I am a freelance journalist and that's how I make my living and these are the events which are happening in Africa. They are not the only events but they are cataclysmic events, they are the extremes of human experience, they affect millions of Africans. I believe it is legitimate to cover them, I believe it is right to cover them. I think the issue is how we cover them.  Now I am going to quote something from a piece I wrote for The Guardian which is just a very short quote from a woman I met in South West Rwanda:

	"We had 7 goats said Josephine Muhugareeu (?). We lost five when we were running. Then we got hungry and sold the other two. We sold all our clothes, my blanket, my headscarf and three plates. Now we have nothing."

	Now the reason I quote that is because it took me a long time to get that. When I first met Josephine she just said, "Oh, we had some animals and lost everything". and that was that.  It took a long time to get out exactly what they had lost, how many goats, three plates, one headscarf. That is authentic. That is exactly what she lost, and I think it is really important to write down exactly what she lost and it takes a long time to do it. It is particularly hard to do that kind of reporting if you are broadcasting because it would have taken about half-an-hour's worth of tape to actually get that, it's much easier if you are just taking notes, and that means that it is very hard to get the authentic voice of poor Africans, Africans who don't speak English or French, (you are working through a translator), Africans who are unable to put their  voices across easily to the outside world. It takes a long time.  I was in the States the other day and I was watching C & N and there was a particular incident where some people had been beaten up. This was in Haiti and C & N had a lot of cameras around and they ran this piece of footage and there were no words. There was no commentary, you just saw what was happening and I was horrified because I think that one of the most important things is to put the words across. What people say, and also what you understand when you have finally asked the right question, and I am horrified by this trend towards just seeing without making any effort to really understand, but the difficulty of understanding and the difficulty of hearing what people have to say is time. The pressure on the journalist is to get the story out and to get it out quickly. As a broadcaster working primarily for BBC radio  and as a freelance journalist, the best thing I can do is find somebody's ......................... and sit by it and listen to what all the other journalists have to say and turn it round in interviews and dispatches and I can make a lot of money doing that. I can just sit there and turn it around without ever really going out, and if I really go out and I spend one days, two days, three days finding out what really happens, talking to people, finding out what they really felt, working with a translator, going back asking the questions again, it takes a very long time, and you don't really get paid for putting that amount of time in  and that makes it very difficult and it makes it increasingly difficult to put the authentic voices across. One of the things which has changed broadcasting from Africa is the satellite phone and it is a blessing in many ways. Gone are the days when you would disappear into Southern Sudan and nobody hears about you for two weeks and they faintly begin to worry. Now on the whole people do have access to satellite phone and that is very useful that you can get the story across and get some sense of immediacy, but it does mean that increasingly you are under pressure to work to the time frame here on the next deadline, rather than allowing people the time they need to speak and allowing yourself the time you need to find out and I think that the danger of this is the coverage of Africa will become increasingly superficial if we don't allow ourselves the time and have the modesty to know that we need the time in order to understand properly.

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	One of the reasons that we at The Guardian selected Lindsey is precisely because she does go out for two or three days and produces a story that nobody else has got, so I know it's very hard but there is quite a lot of appreciation for that kind of way of working.

	Our next speaker is Andy Kershaw who is also a freelance and as far as I know, only does radio.  Andy has the kind of special gift of not only hearing people but managing to put over in the vary difficult area of things like the Today programme where you are used to hearing endless carrying on between one British politician and another just very very occasionally you get this very very different voice and I well remember the first report that Andy did from Rwanda and I don't know if anybody else heard it, but it was certainly enough to wake you up and completely different kind of presentation that anyone else had done on radio, and to have actually managed to get it on to the Today programme rather than the kind of ghetto of the Africa Service or even the BBC World Service. So, one of the things that I wanted to ask Andy to talk to us about is how it is that he as a freelancer has, as far as I know, a particular toe hole within the BBC manages to get programmes from places like Ecuadorian Guinea or the Rwanda story which he did in the very early days from the Zaire border where other people hadn't done that kind of thing. How he manages to get to various kinds of places and actually persuade the BBC to run his very original material. I know you have just come back from Malawi, so perhaps you could tell us why you were setting a kind of agenda in Malawi?


<p>
<b>Andy Kershaw</b><br>	Well I went back to Malawi to make a programme for Channel Four, a straightforward travel programme because I thought it would be worth going back post Dr Banda to see how the country had changed since I was last there which was in 1993 and was a very different place.  But how do they send me to places like Malawi?  Interestingly enough, and this fact still astonishes me, after the best part of ten years Nancying around Africa I have become known as Mr. Africa Music on the radio and documentaries and things for Radio Four, this was the very first time I had ever shot a frame of film in Africa and I think it was just dogged persistence with certain commissioning editors and production companies that I wore them down saying isn't it about time we went to this interesting country.  But in the case of Equatorial Guinea I went there, as I go to many places, simply because nobody else bothers to go.  I think why do I never hear anything about this country. What kind of place is it? That's how my fascination with Haiti started in those wilderness years between, well certainly wilderness years as far as stories were concerned, for journalists is when the Devaliers???and the arrival of Aristeed????  I went to Haiti simply because no one else did, and in the case of Rwanda I wasn't supposed to go to Rwanda at all.  The way it happened was that a friend of mine who was the editor of From Our Own Correspondent then moved to the Today programme and as far as I understand it was going around the office, we need someone to go to Berundi. There were too stories:  Will it spread because of the same ethnic mix, and how will these Rwandan refugees cope in the surrounding countries.  Well we met an adult within a day and a half that was going into Zaire as well, so we were just basically sitting around a bar of an hotel in Budjembura (?) with a lot of bickering hacks and aid workers, but after about a day and a half of that I just simply you know got bored with the novelty, and what pushed me into it was two guys sidled up to me at the bar one evening who turned out to be the Budjembura representatives of the RPF and they said if you would like to go over into RPF territory, territory that we have held for some time, we can radio over the border. As we had nothing else to do we simply took up their offer.

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	Well I think that gives you . . .  on the one hand its a kind of mixture of very enterprising people like Andy who also have a bit of good luck of who they happen to stand next to in bars, but also that this whole kind of wall of commissioning editors that I think a lot of people find, and there's been a lot of talk about it during the day, I think to be a kind of wall that prevent people doing the kind of thing they want to do, don't always have to be like that and people break through it, and I have spoken to a couple that do.

<p>
<b>Andy Kershaw</b><br>	Can I add something else as well?  I was relying on my sleeping bag while in Malawi.  I was trying to think why I had never made a film in Africa in ten years of doing television and one of the conclusions I came to, I think by and large the people who populate the television industry are scared of the place. I think it's much easier to go off and make programmes in less difficult places which is the top and bottom of it, and certainly of one of the people who was on this team with me, I think would confirm that. There is a resistance to it because (i) we don't understand anything about and (ii) they are frightened of it because it has an image of just being a desperate place and very often a violent place and uncomfortable place, they shy away from it.

<p>
<b>Voice</b><br>	Tell us more about the bickering hacks?

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	We haven't got very much time.  Thank you Andy.<p>
 

	Our last speaker has a slightly more conventional profile as far as television is concerned. It is Peter Gill who is the new editor of Africa Express. He has worked a lot in Africa. He first of all worked with VSO in Sudan in the sixties, so he knows a lot about the work on the ground of aid agencies. He has also written a book about OXFAM and its work in Africa and he worked or quite a long time in print working most of the time for The Daily Telegraph as Foreign Correspondent. Then he worked at Thames and made a number of films for them, mostly about Africa and now he is going to be the editor of Africa Express for Channel Four.

<p>
<b>Peter Gill</b><br>	And I only became editor of Africa Express in the past week so I have no direct responsibility for the first series and all these brick bats that were thrown around earlier this afternoon simply bounced off me.  I am here however quite shamelessly to buttonhole people and to pick people's brains as to ideas and suggestions for the second series of Africa Express which is going to be transmitted in the Spring. Africa incidentally is catching up on Europe. I have edited three series of Europe Express, which is the progenitor of Africa Express and is also coming back next year, and Africa is catching up. The first Europe Express series that I edited was of ten programmes, it has now slipped to eight. The first series of Africa Express was give programmes, next Spring it will be six.  Although I haven't had direct responsibility for Africa Express I can say something about the Express approach which why I think it is so valid, why it is just as applicable to Africa as it is to Europe. First this is Current Affairs journalism, it's not news background, and it's not news analysis. Current Affairs show, particularly Magazine Shows like Africa Express can certainly deal with big news stories but only when they have something valid or original t say about them. If they can't find any such thing to say, then in my opinion they shouldn't bother to say it. Dealing with Europe the challenge was always to get beyond that news agenda, not to ignore the news agenda, but to go beyond it, to go beyond in the European context high politics and politicians in suits, to go beyond Europe as an institution and the British obsession with Brussels and bent bananas and all of that. The challenge I think is very similar for Africa Express. We shouldn't ignore all the big news stories of war, aids, famine, coups, conflict - I was going to say in my notes tribal conflict but 'tribal' has been scored out and interspersed with 'conflict'. But we won't touch those issues unless we have got something truly original and surprising to say about them and if we haven't got such things then we move on to other stories and tell them instead, and the story for a magazine programme like Africa Express is the thing. We have an annual series of just six programmes and you can't afford to start at the other end of the spectrum with the news agenda and all those big themes, you've got to bear the latter in mind but then push them aside in the interests of a good story that viewers haven't seen before on a subject they perhaps haven't even thought about. Now there are particular challenges to reporting Africa for a show like Africa Express, one it seems to me is to avoid good news for the sake of 'good' news. It's too contrived and the viewers in my experience aren't mugs. They can see right the way through a contrived effort to tell a good news story about a bad news situation, so for instance successful agricultural project in Northern Ethiopia or somewhere in the Sahill mightn't interest me as the editor of Africa Express but some unexpected, surprising off the wall story about food somewhere else in Africa would, specifically because viewers bring all their background knowledge and a lot of psychological baggage with them to bear on any story about food in Africa. I will give you one good example of the sort of thing I am talking about from the last series of Africa Express. This was a report on the craze for cycling as a sport in Eritrea (?)  It's now apparently virtually the national sport. Now this seems to me to be a surprising and colourful way of telling people that Eritrea(?) was at peace after a generation of war, the longest war in Africa, the longest civil conflict apparently in the world, without either giving viewers a dreary history lesson or a piece of the political analysis. In all sorts of ways we need to get beyond the familiar and the predictable. We could for instance try avoiding animal tales unless they make a particularly valid story, but there was actually one rather good animal story in the last run of Africa Express.  We would want for instance in this series to look at commerce rather than agriculture because that might surprise a lot of British viewers and we should also strive to identify authentic local talking points rather than what European editors think Africans are probably talking about. The next challenge, at least in this second series is to get beyond all the familiar countries and the familiar story areas for good practical reasons, the first series of Africa went for Commonwealth, South Africa before it re-entered the Commonwealth and one trip to Ethiopia and Eretrea???  On the next run we need, if we can get the money, is to go to Frankaphone???? West Africa, we need to go to Islamic Africa and maybe parts of Africa not colonised by the British that even Channel Four viewers would not be able to find on a map.

<p>
<b>Voice</b><br>	Equatorial Guinea!

<p>
<b>Peter Gill</b><br>	Equatorial Guinea being a good example.  There is a further all embracing challenge to making this sort of programme about Africa and that's budget and logistics and extraordinarily few people have actually talked budget during today. On Europe Express for instance, we shoot 6-8 minutes films in two days, sometimes in one. We pick up local crews, always, and we can do all of our research down the telephone to London deploying researchers who have a command of or the right languages. In Africa we know that that is hopelessly unrealistic. Not only is there official suspicion of the Western media making it difficult to get into, but all the practical difficulties of communicating down telephone lines in the country let alone from London. Now all these problems can doubtless be overcome and are overcome on substantial Current Affairs shows but they need staff and money and resources to overcome them, and the biggest problem of all is that Africa Express's budget is not proportionately larger than Europe Express's budget, and we hope to achieve the same sort of impact.  For me the upshot of all this is that we need to go where stories are achievable. That may on occasions mean consciously ducking some of the toughest areas in some of the tougher countries, simply because several weeks spent cracking a 7 minute film can't be attempted on an African Express budget. I was trying to think of a good story example and it was actually provided almost earlier this afternoon.  What about an eight minute film on a Nigerian corruption story shot in two - perhaps we could be really generous - in three days. But despite all those difficulties and despite our perhaps having to duck some of the awkward subjects I still believe there is a strong justification these days for Africa Express to concentrate on stories that go beyond the news agenda, make colourful films and without contrived good news and presented in a fairly positive and upbeat fashion.

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	Well you have heard from four people who spend their lives reporting Africa in one way or another, and now we would like to hear from you.
<p>

<b>DISCUSSION:</b>
<p>


<b>Julian Samboma - Freelance Journalist & Media Student, City University</b><br>

	I think I am very fortunate to be at this Conference and I think you have covered the issues . . . are radically different and reporting about Africa is very important. It is the only area of he world where .......  I think again reporting on Africa is dependent on the media response . . . . and the FT closed with this rigid view that the problem with Africa is that they are not implementing these policies properly and these policies can't work whereas The Guardian has a more critical approach, they don't say everything about Africa is wrong but they are doing certain things wrong, and that's the kind of reporting that is needed. I mean that's the way I feel and Mr Gill was talking about the programme on Africa.  Since I have been watching British television no programme has come out to criticise the shortcomings of the programmes. What they did once was to bring in Ghana as a so-called IMF success story. I mean the whole programme was a farce and I think talking about the 'good' story idea, that's a good story idea. . . and I can apply for a job now.

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	Do you want to reply to that?

<p>
<b>Michael Holman</b><br>	Just a brief comment because there are may people with something to say.  But the other explanation of the acronym in Nigeria at least of SAP is search a butcher's pockets!  

<p>
<b>Daniel  Ofori - 	Ghana Broadcasting Corporation</b><br>

	I would like to react briefly to this statement made by the gentleman who says he is a student of City University. I will go straight to Ghana. With regard to the structural adjustment, Ghana has liberalised all financial controls and now there is free enterprise in Ghana. You don't need foreigners to transfer money from Ghana or to Ghana.  I just did a research about the number of vehicles that have come to Ghana over the past ten years. In 1983 people were travelling in articulated trucks that were being used by Ghanians as passenger vehicles. Now you can go to Ghana and you can find in average homes at least one vehicle. In Akra where we have people called Burgers. These are traders at least every young man in Ghana has a vehicle. Now did a lot of research just before I came here last week. City planning is not matching up to the development that is taking place in Accra now. People are now building their own houses, I would say mansions beyond the planned areas and therefore this is also creating problems for  city administrators. It is not true that the structure adjustment programme has not succeeded. The structure programme has increased with the personality of the Ghanaians.

<br><b>Chair</b><br>	We will stop there because if we wanted to start a debate on structure I am sure there are many others who could be. . . .I think we will try to keep more on actual media issues.

<p>
<b>Paddy Coulter	 - Director, International Broadcasting Trust</b><br>

	I wanted to pick up something that Peter said about 'good' news. I think that he is right. I don't suppose anyone in the room wants to have contrived 'good' news stories for the sake of good news.  I hesitate to bring this up because it go into the Martin Lewis 'good' news debate which causes people to spit, or otherwise.  I was listening to Lindsey having to exist on the diet of war and disaster and catastrophe and Peter in the search for the non contrived good story, I just wondered really what the panel felt was the scope for ... I wouldn't use the word 'positive' or 'good' versus bad, but a broader agenda, because I think that out of the last session listening to Rakiya talking about why we still hear this very narrow group of images, narrow stories. Clearly we still are, and why are we?  I think there is a debate here which I think needs to come out . . . I was thinking of the BBC having made a good move on in the last ten years, and that was the appointment of the developing world correspondent, George Argyle. . . ??? He's now in Johannesburg and the job's been re-advertised.  But George said that when he was in Rwanda - maybe Lindsey can bear this out - that he had that pressure down the satellite film together on I think . .  I quote him in saying, "Stop the bloody cackle about the analysis, get up in the fucking helicopter".  We want the aerial shots. The pressure for the picture, for the narrow agenda, even when you've got an absolutely first rate correspondent who would see his or her brief in a wider way, I think that's something we need to talk about. Now I think that the people who need to be confronted with this are not the people on the panel, you are the good guys (excuse the sexism). I feel that if we want to move the debate on we have only got to get the foreign news editors, we have got to get the people who make the decisions that influence . . . and I am thinking more about television Victoria, rather than The Guardian where I think you have a more enlightened regime, but I think this is really important. At the end of the last debate listening to people attacking Channel Four or by implication,  when Channel Four has done more than any single Channel to produce diversity of drama, short stories, African Express and whatever. Whatever reservations about individual pieces, the fact is that that's there, but when you put the challenge are they in news terms doing anything radically different from the mainstream news agenda, and of the researchers the overwhelming majority have stories about the ... now as they were five years ago, or ten years ago, are war and disaster and there will be in five years time, and either we have to accept that and say that those are news values handed down immutably and there is nothing that can be done about that or in scope for a broader agenda.  Can we get the views of the panel on that?

<p>
<b>Lindsey Hilsum</b><br>	Paddy, I don't think that the news agenda is radically different for Africa than it is for the rest of the world. I also think that the way to change it or to broaden it is in how you cover it. Now I sympathise with George obviously about this issue and getting the helicopter, because I think that you address it is that you deal with ...stories about Africa tend to be seen in hundreds of thousands and masses rather than in individuals and people with characters and lives and ideas and individual pain and individual joy and all the kind of human emotions. I think the best way of dealing with it is to cover the stories that the news agenda gives but do it in the most enlighten and imaginative way that will reach across and bring out the other issues as well, because I spent years of my life trying to write interesting development stories about Fatima in the village and now she's got a well, isn't it wonderful . . . and I'm bored still of it and I never want to write a story like that again in my life!

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	One more person from the panel.  One other speaker and then you can speak.

<p>
<b>Michael Holman</b><br>	I just want to make the point that sometimes I see Africa portrayed especially perhaps by the World Bank as Continent that I don't recognise. My experience of the Continent is demonstrably declining, deteriorating. There is more poverty, more hardship, more stress and more difficulty, and the objective of recovery is becoming distant, not closer. Film the fundamental realities of that predicament, the talk of trying to change the approach to the African crisis seems to me frankly irrelevant. The danger is that there is a World Bank portraying a Continent as recovering. It is not.  But at the same time the dispute between the World Bank and the development agencies and NGO's is profoundly dangerous because it is leaving a confused international constituency. What the hell's going on? We are moving to a point where the African crisis is becoming very close to being irrecoverable, and that's the fundamental issue that the journalists are trying to confront, and sometimes the concern about whether we are portraying too harsh a view of Africa I think becomes distractible.

<p>
<b>Ibrahima San	 - Director of Radio, RTS Senegal</b><br>

	First I am a bit worried and distressed about the way Africa is being talked about in a global way.  I feel dissolved in an anonymous Continent with no sense of identity and belonging to a country.  I hear a description of a situation. I used to hear from "expert specialists" . They used to be when I was here people who had modules in their drawers. Whenever a situation would occur they would call on them, they would pull out a drawer and then in came the specialists and just lay out that thing and go away.  I am sure you have countries in Africa with specific history, with specific teachers of their own culture and ways of development and these descriptions are so sweeping, I am a bit worried. Victoria may tell me as Foreign Editor, do journalists here actually work hard on looking at the country, or do they work from preconceived received ideas on Africa, and are they all experts?

<p>
<b>Victoria Britain</b><br>	Well first of all I am not the Foreign Editor, I am the Foreign News Editor, the species being reviled over there by Paddy. But I think of course some journalists who operate in the kind of way that you are talking about. . . (end of side 1)  in Senegal, or Eretraia?? Botswana who could perfectly well have spoken on those very specific subjects but it isn't what we are here to discuss today, it is a very broad topic and if you want to criticise the topic, that's a completely different issue.


<p>
<b>Jenny Mitchell - 	Spectrum Magazine, Independent Television Commission</b><br>

	Something about. . .   the three plates and taking a long time (talking about the lady who lost everything) going back and back so that you could actually get a bit of a cheap thrill and in fact it wasn't exactly that difficult for that woman to describe what she had actually lost, why was it so important for you to know exactly what she lost . . . so that a reader of a broadsheet in this country could do some pitying?

<p>
<b>Who is this?</b><br>	I just wanted to mention what Paddy was saying. It seems to me that there is a big middle ground between on the one hand the disasters, famines and coups which Lindsey admitted she specialises in and she does try to report them sensibly, but I think there is a whole other area of things which are not so obviously newsworthy in the news managers scheme of things. I just want to give you two tiny examples. I went to Somaliland to try to report traditional conflict resolution which has worked very well in that country. I could not get any television channel here to be interested at all, but I sold the story on return because they were so interested in it. The same thing happened with going to Tigre, rebelled held Tigre where an indigenous NGO was coping with the drought. Nobody was interested before I went. When I came back with the pictures they bought them. Now that's the problem you've got. You put forward ideas, Lindsey's fine, and that sort of area, OK, but what Paddy is saying is that there is an enormous area of African experience which is not disasters but which is where interesting things are happening and particularly things which are being initiated by Africans, and we as white reporters tend to neglect those, but the main problem is not the reporters I don't think, its the news managers who won't take these stories until you come up with them.

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	I would just like to ask if there is any of this reviled species in the room?  A television foreign news editor?  Or anybody who has . . . oh goodness, how brave!  Thank you.

<p>
<b>Colette Dumez - Vice President (Sales) - Europe & Africa 
	 World wide Television News Corporation</b><br>

	I am not involved with the day-to-day covering of the news because in fact I am involved with Africa and Europe and mainly sales in Africa, but I have become involved with Africa very closely recently going around the various countries and making contacts with television like Afrovision, and trying to find out more about what the African television people want to get from us and to try to help them. So what I want to say, because you seem to be looking for somebody who covers news, yes we do cover news in Africa, we cover Rwanda exclusively, we cover Somalia, we were the last crew in Somalia recently and we are looking at other countries, we are going into Liberia. I was very interested in the Nigerian gentleman who said why aren't we hearing from Nigeria. Well we can't get into Nigeria and the only picture we get out of Nigeria is from a freelancer and obviously he is trying to stay on the right side of the government and doesn't show us anything except the side of the election that he covered.  I used to be a producer myself, I know a lot about satellite. I would like to point out that Africa is moving finally into the world of communication, that as of April next year we will have ...........band communication in Africa which will mean that there will be communication between the different African countries on a smaller scale. You won't have to spend thousands and thousands of pounds or dollars to communicate between let's say to cover Nigeria and bring the picture back to London and then sending them back into Africa. So I think that's very important.  The other thing I wanted to  mention is that WTN does produce Current Affairs programming - you might see on SKY and you will see that we often have an item on Africa, in fact I have done some calculations, it is about 50-odd items of 6 minutes per year.

<p>
<b>Peter Salmon - Controller Factual Programmes, Channel Four Television</b><br>

	I am not a news editor, but I suppose I help set Channel Four's news agenda and work across a range of programmes on Channel Four.  I am slightly worried from some of the comments . . . there seems to be a sense that there is a conspiracy against Africa which I just don't recognise. I feel as negligent of certain issues back here in the UK, of issues in the former Soviet Republics I have never covered, of Sri Lanka, and bits of the former Indo-China, of Latin America, you know I think our job in a sense, whatever the merits of individual stories we have talked about today, is to look for original ways to talk about Africa and a broad and wider way of talking about Africa. I think it is too sudden to neglect the disasters, the wars, the famines etc.,  and it seems to be me to be one of the great challenges, I think the detail of Lindsey's report comes in, or Andy's idiosyncrasies, or the fact in a sense he is given leeway to tell it like he sees it . . . I think that if you are news manager like I am, you are looking for originality, you want someone to come at a story in a way to tell you something about it you have not read in the cuttings, something original that will stimulate people's imaginations, that's going to get people more interested
	and not narrow them. So, two things, (a) please don't think there is a conspiracy, and (b) please breathe the same imagination into African issues that we all breathe into issues from other Continents.

<p>
<b>Mike Wooldridge - BBC Radio 4, Religious Affairs Correspondent</b><br>

	It still strikes me that Lindsey's point about focusing on individuals and individual stories is perhaps important in trying to overcome the apparent gulf between Ibrahima San and Michael Holman. Ibrahima is obviously right that it's too easy to given an over-simplistic view of Africa as a whole, and there's a good deal of wealth alongside the poverty, but within an individual community, telling individual stories so often helps to show the poor within that community, the exploiters and the exploited if you like, and I though in terms of looking for a way forward in reporting and getting away from stereotypes was a most important point that she made.

<p>
<b>Karin Sieger - Research Department, BBC World Service</b><br>

	Two very brief observations - but before that just a personal remark:  It has been a very long day for all of us and very interesting and I would like to take the opportunity to applaud my colleagues whether BBC or whatever or wherever for the hard work that they do and very often for putting their own lives at risk to bring us the news whether it is the full news or half the news, I don't care, they are doing it and I am not doing it.   
	Two quick points:  I must mention something which has been on my mind for a long time. Some of our colleagues, and we all know who they are, have a way of introducing a bias in the way we report news, the way we report anything from wherever. There are some people who like the comfortable life and who prefer to go if you have a choice to the well-known tourist resorts of East Africa rather than some of the less comfortable places in West Africa for example, and I think we all know the two countries I am talking about, and I always find it extremely amazing that people who are in a position to say, "Hey, hang on a minute, why should we send somebody there again?" They don't say that, and off they go and bring back a story which we may have heard before.  I hope I am not stepping on anybody's toes, but I would like to suggest that any serious journalist needs to at one stage in his/her career put himself/herself or be put in a position where he/she can face his/her own limits of duress and hopefully extend them to the benefits of the organisation they work for. That's one way of investing in the human resources that work for us.
	The second point which was touched upon very briefly . . . and would be useful if we have a Conference like this again . . . a separate item on the agenda - it's what I call the economics of broadcasting. We have budgets. We have programme budgets which force us to make a decision whether we for example, send the reporter on a duty tour or whether we have three stringers reporting in any one week from three different countries. Those are all very important considerations that I am sure you are all aware of but which we also have to explore, and a lot of broadcasting organisations are unfortunately put in the position where they have to spend a lot of time on accounting, rather than finding the programme ideas. I am not criticising it, that's a fact of life, and that's where we go, and I think that is something that should be included in a discussion of this nature.

<p>
<b>Name? (Sounds like Ngamba)</b><br>
	I must reiterate what other speakers have said. A lot of foreign journalists are doing a good job in Africa. Thousands of Europeans....  for a long time, and until Mohamed Amin did a .........on the problem in Ethiopa nobody knew that Ethiopians were dying. We are aware that the team of correspondents at Chester House where my friend was from the BBC, are doing an extremely good job, but there are other bunches of journalists who may be called the tourist journalists, who come to Nairobi for one day, go to Chester House, have a drink with one or two local journalists and given an extremely distorted picture of what the country is all about. These are the people I hope respectable journalists in this country will point fingers at.  We go to Chester House and ask who is this gentleman and are told this guy was here for one day and was passing through Uganda or somewhere and they wrote this article in one day. This brings in the point that someone was saying, some of these young journalists have nothing - I have nothing against youth, I was once a very young man! - but the trouble with these young journalists whose understanding of the African Continent is almost nil, make themselves experts in one night and I think the editors in London and elsewhere should really make serious positions and send to Africa journalists who understand Africa.
	Finally a challenge to my colleagues, the African television producers, like the gentleman from Kamaroon, Stella here, also a producer, there must be African producers who do a lot of production on African material. We don't know that these problems exist.  When you go to Cannes or look on the London market we work through the film catalogues, we don't see any programmes done by our brothers and sisters, or done by people of Afro descent. I think the challenge is with you to see how best we can get our own brothers and sisters, get the programmes to Africa instead of just concentrating on the problems made by whites in London and New York or elsewhere. I am not saying there is anything wrong with these programmes.  I will be quarrelling with my friend from Ghana, but we who live here and are in the television business then we must........ programmes produced in other countries.

<b>Name? - ndependent Producer</b><br>

	My apologies for being late and missing this session. I have just come back from South Africa and there was a slight problem about the schedules, and I was also at a meeting today.  I have just come back from South Africa and one thing I noticed is . . . I worked in South Africa on and off, I used to work for the BBC for about 5/6 years and they had two developed broadcasting industries working side-by-side with almost no connection between the two of them. You had an indigenous broadcasting industry which had completely failed to cover the story that was around them and you had the foreign broadcasting company which is the biggest in Africa, you know permanent bureaux for all the major news networks all sitting there enjoying quite a lot of South Africa employing a lot of foreigners. The two had almost nothing to do with each other and still today, that's by and largely the case and I think that's one point that ultimately produces a divisive image, divisive perspectives on Africa will only come when that has developed to a greater extent when all Africans who are capable of getting access into either to money, to media, to all the streams that connect here to there. And the other thing connects with that which there is a News and Current Affairs bottleneck. I mean basically all the people you are describing coming to Africa are interested. It's not a conspiracy, but from the moment they get off that plane they are interested in certain stories, they are trying to find news stories, putting them together for news bulletins, they are not trying to find Africa's great writers. They are not making a history series, they are not making. . . it's a very limited bottleneck, so that the richness and diversity of the Continent ends up being squeezed into this very fine filter which is the judgement of News and Current Affairs journalists to represent a whole Continent again and I think it is the very narrowness that then creates the problems that you are talking about when you say about this bias and a feeling that you are not being represented properly, and again I think it's right to make a piece of British broadcasting and all international broadcasting, but it's not so much a news story, and its not so much an issue of covering that news story, in the specific case of South Africa I think the international media did a much better job of covering that news story than the indigenous media in that case. The problem isn't that so much, I think, as getting . . . why shouldn't someone doing a history series include Africa in the history series, generally speaking they don't. Why shouldn't arts, culture, these series why shouldn't they be looking to Africans, why shouldn't they be looking to . . . we are still dominated. . . I mean people like Peter, still inundated with projects which will have American connections, to a lesser extent European connections, very few with African connections.  I am not talking about things that may specifically address Africa, the point is to get Africa put on the map on every map, I think that's what's missing.

<b>? Ingram??? - Save the Children</b><br> 

	I want to try and tie a few things quickly together and leave a point at the end. Victoria started the session by saying that Broadcast journalists often pick up their stories from the print media. What angers me is when good work is being done in the print media - as an example Lindsey's work on Rwanda identifying the origins and the nature of the genocide at an early stage - and that fails to be translated into the broadcast coverage which follows afterwards, and I think this particularly striking example of that was a Newsnight programme about Rwanda, an hour long special which I suppose they should be praised for doing, where they had a very good group of people there as an audience to speak to the presenter, including Rakiyer, and they had two very good reporters on the ground, Robin Densel?? Goma and John Simpson from Inside the Country both of whom were absolutely clear about what had happened in Rwanda and yet the programme as a whole, especially the introduction insisted that the problem in Rwanda was one of long standing ethnic violence and even occasionally gave the impression that the people who fled into Goma were fleeing because they were being massacred. Now I would thoroughly agree with Lindsey's point that whatever we think of other ways of doing things, whatever we think of current reporting the news agenda is going to continue to be about the wars and famines and is going to continue to shape everybody's view of Africa, speaking of the mass of the general public here. The question therefore which faces everybody is how do we educate the editors, because they are the ones who control the gates, they are the ones who control whether good journalists, good development organisations can get their story across, they are the ones who are also far too busy feeding the machine to be able to come to Conferences like this one.

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	Thank you very much John?  Don???

<b>Alison Campbell - Media Officer, CARE</b><br>

	I was a producer for a while at ITN before I took this job I was called into ITN on the first day of the Rwanda crisis because I had just arrived back, knowing very little more than anybody else in that newsroom, and I was asked to pontificate about the state of Rwandan politics which I was reluctant to do, but it was my job and I did it and hoped that I wasn't making too many mistakes. In the course of the last six months I have learned a hell of a lot more, but every time I have been called back for an interview, every time I have been to the World Service for an interview, or to SKY, I come up against a producer who might have been pulled off an entirely different story and who has absolutely no knowledge of that situation and I have heard exactly the same clichs arise over and over again. I have been shocked to hear the situation be described as a civil war, the suffering of the refugees who, as this gentleman said, were portrayed as fleeing because they had reason to fear for their lives, and with more and more - it doesn't matter what is coming from the report of the experts in the field and the is more and more picture material being handed over to process they are also the ones who need to be educated or need to be identified to have areas of special attention where they will bring some knowledge to the intro's which they write, the thinking material which they write and the script which they write to agency pictures I think is absolutely vital especially as the thing starts to fall down the news agenda and you are no longer hearing from an expert on the spot, the entire issue is then thrown back into the hands of someone who doesn't necessarily know what they are talking about.

<p>
<b>(inaudible person) - 
African Male</b><br>	I think there is a problem with journalists writing about Africa seem to take a number of the institutional constraints that they feel as given, they don't plan or wish or are not able to do much about it. There are budgetary constraints, all of these are given and people from this sort of background to try and work objectively with experts on a Continent about which they do not know much, and if you tie that to what this gentleman was saying when a journalist lands from the plane with some little box that represents some keymatic objective, it just shows you the big problem of knowledge of journalists coming from the West to write about a different society, no matter how sympathetic, how well intentioned. Doesn't it strike you that no matter how long an African lives here, even when he takes a PhD and things like that, nobody invites them here to come and talk, it is almost automatically taken for granted . . . some of us have been post-graduates here, but it not the case that you are called on BBC to come and talk as experts because you just assume that we can never feel and know this place enough. . . and it is so easy for people coming from a background of so many constraints and then go in there and feeling so easy and free that they can write with so much authority.

<p>
<b>Chair</b><br>	I would like to give the microphone to A.M. (sounds like Akmar Moussoo) who is one of the BBC World Service Africa Service journalists whom none of these problems of ignorance and so on can possibly be attributed to. 

<p>
<b>A.M.</b><br>	I would like to pick up on what you say. One of the things that I feel strongly about and I think a lot of my colleague on Focus on Africa, the programme I am the deputy editor of, is that we are seeing every day, because we do 20 or so news items every day, a real range of talent from all over Africa talking about piling up stories. We use African journalists almost exclusively, or else we use stringers who come from here but who have been living an African country for a very long time, and we think that that talent is better than anything we can get from somebody who comes in for one week and delivers their considered opinion of what is happening in that country which they have never been to before and will never visit again.  I would just like to put in a plea, and I think many of us want to put it in, that people here, commissioning editors, news editors take a look at the talent on the ground and make use of it because so often what happens is, this is my own experience of this directly was going and working in Angola during the Angolan elections. I saw so many foreign journalists come and sit in the press centre and retail the same stories in the same little circles around and around, never ever speaking to an Angolan, never doing their own leg work, and so every story that came out of Angola about the elections sounded identical because basically they had exactly the same source which was each other, and we feel really strongly that people should use local people and make sure that they do their own leg work, and Lindsey's point about it, taking a lot of time is well taken, but at the same time if people really want decent quality material coming out of Africa, then that's what's got to happen.  I would just like to add a final point about Africa Express. That is the answer to your problem. It's not about looking for good news, it's about widening your agenda. If you have a large range of sources of local sources of material you won't have any trouble finding interesting stories, they won't have to be good news or bad news, they will just be interesting.

<b>Tim Modise - Journalist and Broadcaster, Radio Metro, South Africa</b><br>

	I would like to echo what Ibrahim has said and maybe put it into some context of sorts why he expressed himself the way he did. And before I do that maybe also to say thank you to the British World Service Africa because those of us in South Africa we get to know what's going on on the rest of the Continent from them, so we thank you for that.  I think what Abrahim's content was all about, and I will also give you a South African picture about this, is that when African countries are lumped together, and like you said Michael earlier on, the rest of Africa is degenerating and so on and so forth, that it in many ways harms the images of individual countries in Africa, for example we have send Mandella to the US to preach for investment and so on, and repeatedly most businessmen were asking him about Rwanda, whether Rwanda had stabilised and Rwanda is about 1,500 kilometers away from South Africa. They thought that it had very much to do with what was going on in South Africa, so in some ways the way we reflect on Africa in that generalised sense sometimes does more harm than good.

<h2 align=center> Is your employer keeping good company?</h2>


<p>
Companies can make huge contributions to charitable causes - but often need encouragement by their
employees.

<p>There are many ways to encourage your company to support ACTIONAID:

<p><ul><li>Suggest that the company sponsor a child for each team of employees.

<p><li>Persuade it to donate to ACTIONAID and we will tell you and your colleagues what your money
has
achieved.

<p><li>Ask for permission to promote Payroll Giving to your colleagues to benefit ACTIONAID.

<p><li>Raise money with your colleagues by organising an event - and ask the company to match the
amount raised.
</ul>
<p>The company might prefer a commercial sponsorship of, for example, our development education
materials, which reach millions of children, or ACTIONAID Week materials which reach millions of
households. Even producing a calendar or Christmas card for clients and staff can benefit ACTIONAID
as
well as the company.

<p>If you would like some help in developing one of these ideas with your employer, tick the relevant
box
on the <b><a href="order.html">order form</a></b> or talk to ACTIONAID's Corporate Development

<A NAME="int"></A>L'auteur de cet article propose l'examen acad&eacute;mique
des d&eacute;fis &agrave; relever par le syst&egrave;me global
de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; l'issue
de la Guerre froide. Il affirme que les compromis qui ont fa&ccedil;onn&eacute;
l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement depuis la Seconde guerre mondiale
sont aujourd'hui d&eacute;pass&eacute;s, et plaide une remise
en question totale de la strat&eacute;gie afin que les communaut&eacute;s
qui ne sont pas des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s d'abondance puissent
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier de l'av&egrave;nement mondial d'une &quot;d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute;&quot;.</B>
<P>
Autant l'admettre : la coop&eacute;ration internationale au d&eacute;veloppement
va entrer en crise. Pendant pr&egrave;s de 50 ans, le monde d&eacute;velopp&eacute;
a consid&eacute;r&eacute; l'aide comme une chose normale. Tel
n'est plus le cas et sa g&eacute;n&eacute;rosit&eacute;, en termes
r&eacute;els, s'en ressent d&eacute;j&agrave;. Le &quot;dividende
de la paix&quot;, tant attendu, ne s'est pas concr&eacute;tis&eacute;
et l'espoir c&egrave;de la place au scepticisme. L'aide et la
solidarit&eacute; sont d&eacute;sormais per&ccedil;us comme des
concepts d&eacute;mod&eacute;s. Le progr&egrave;s et le d&eacute;veloppement,
entend-on dire de plus en plus souvent, na&icirc;tront d'une coop&eacute;ration
bas&eacute;e sur l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t mutuel et une approche
davantage commerciale.
<P>
C'est aux Etats-Unis que le scepticisme &agrave; l'&eacute;gard
de l'aide atteint son paroxysme. Une majorit&eacute; conservatrice
au Congr&egrave;s recommande des formules &quot;gagnantes&quot;
radicales et l'aide a fait l'objet de coupes sombres. Lentement
mais s&ucirc;rement, l'Am&eacute;rique se retire de la sc&egrave;ne
du d&eacute;veloppement. Faute d'un soutien suffisant de l'opinion
publique, l'administration Clinton tente de &quot;sauver&quot;
les programmes nationaux d'aide en cherchant &agrave; renforcer
la coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres donateurs - et plus particuli&egrave;rement
avec l'UE dont la solidarit&eacute; d&eacute;passe encore l'horizon
de ses propres fronti&egrave;res. Mais en Europe aussi, cet horizon
se r&eacute;tr&eacute;cit. L'Europe a accru son aide &agrave;
ses voisins imm&eacute;diats &agrave; l'Est et dans le Bassin
de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e m&eacute;ridionale. Il semble
soudain plus important de veiller au bonheur et &agrave; la prosp&eacute;rit&eacute;
de ses voisins qu'aux besoins urgents d'amis plus &eacute;loign&eacute;s.
<P>
La fin de la Guerre froide aurait-elle marqu&eacute; la naissance
d'un monde froid - un monde o&ugrave; la solidarit&eacute; internationale
dispara&icirc;t avec les ogives nucl&eacute;aires ? Ou sommes-nous
&agrave; l'aube d'une transformation profonde de la solidarit&eacute;
internationale et de l'aide entre les nations ?
<P>
<A NAME="der"><H3><hr>Derri&egrave;re l'altruisme... un but int&eacute;ress&eacute;</H3></A>
<P>
L'aide internationale a toujours impliqu&eacute; un compromis
au sein de la <I>soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'abondance</I>. Les peuples
et les nations ne sont pas naturellement dispos&eacute;s &agrave;
donner sans recevoir quelque chose en retour. Toute tentative
de comprendre et de r&eacute;orienter l'avenir de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
doit donc s'appuyer sur ce principe fondamental : les donateurs
d'une aide au d&eacute;veloppement agissent sur base d'un compromis
complexe et en perp&eacute;tuelle &eacute;volution entre leur
altruisme et leur int&eacute;r&ecirc;t personnel.
<P>
Les pays riches ne sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement motiv&eacute;s
&agrave; aider des pays plus pauvres que si la d&eacute;marche
renforce leur leadership international, d'une part, et leur propre
s&eacute;curit&eacute; et confort mat&eacute;riel, d'autre part.
Vue sous cet angle et aussi altruiste que soit son objectif, il
appara&icirc;t clairement que l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement ne
peut exister qu'en servant aussi les priorit&eacute;s l&eacute;gitimes,
fussent-elles davantage &eacute;go&iuml;stes, du donateur. En
d'autres termes, le compromis qui a justifi&eacute; l'aide dans
les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s d'abondance &eacute;volue au fil du
temps, et de nouveaux compromis doivent r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement
&ecirc;tre trouv&eacute;s. En p&eacute;riode de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
et de prosp&eacute;rit&eacute;, les donateurs tendent &agrave;
mettre leur int&eacute;r&ecirc;t propre au second plan et &agrave;
coop&eacute;rer dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des pays moins riches.
En p&eacute;riode d'ins&eacute;curit&eacute;, c'est l'altruisme
qui va passer au second plan.
<P>
A l'&eacute;poque coloniale, les flux syst&eacute;matiques d'aide
sont n&eacute;s d'un compromis entre les gouvernements expansionnistes
du nord et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; chr&eacute;tienne et son propre
clerg&eacute; &quot;colonisateur&quot;. Le processus de d&eacute;colonisation
a entra&icirc;n&eacute; une ins&eacute;curit&eacute; croissante
chez la plupart des anciennes puissances coloniales. D&eacute;sireuses
de prot&eacute;ger le capital qu'elles avaient &quot;investi&quot;
dans leurs territoires d'outre-mer, elles ont, au moment de l'ind&eacute;pendance
de ceux-ci, fa&ccedil;onn&eacute; leur aide de mani&egrave;re
&agrave; &quot;acheter&quot; la pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence des nouveaux
dirigeants. Ce processus, qui remplace un compromis colonial par
un compromis n&eacute;ocolonial, a abouti &agrave; l'arrangement
s&eacute;culier et institutionnalis&eacute; de &quot;l'aide bilat&eacute;rale&quot;.
Durant la Guerre froide, en outre, l'aide occidentale a &eacute;t&eacute;
largement utilis&eacute;e pour emp&ecirc;cher le tiers monde de
s'allier avec le second (&agrave; savoir le bloc communiste).
On en est arriv&eacute; ainsi &agrave; un syst&egrave;me d'aide
&agrave; la fois plus international et plus politis&eacute;.
<P>
Vint ensuite la fin de la Guerre froide. Le communisme a rejoint
le colonialisme et le fascisme aux oubliettes de l'histoire. Et
la soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'abondance occidentale, sortie en vainqueur
de ce duel, a impos&eacute; sa vision de la stabilit&eacute;,
de la paix et du progr&egrave;s : un monde de nations souveraines
organis&eacute;es sur la base des principes de la d&eacute;mocratie
et du capitalisme de march&eacute;, et engag&eacute;es &agrave;
respecter leurs territoires respectifs et les droits fondamentaux
de l'homme. Le capitalisme est aujourd'hui la norme dans la plupart
des Etats-nations : des pays aussi sceptiques que l'Inde, voire
aussi r&eacute;ticents que la Chine et le Vietnam, ont fini par
l'adopter. La d&eacute;mocratie n'y a pas encore parcouru le m&ecirc;me
chemin mais elle progresse dans des conditions favorables. Le
pluralisme politique est en phase de consolidation dans la plus
grande partie de l'Europe centrale et orientale, et les r&eacute;gimes
dictatoriaux d'Afrique, d'Asie et d'Am&eacute;rique latine font
d&eacute;sormais figure d'exception.
<P>
Cette &eacute;volution a entra&icirc;n&eacute; l'&eacute;rosion
rapide des conditions du compromis sur lequel l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
a longtemps v&eacute;cu. Les approches traditionnelles semblent
perdre leur raison d'&ecirc;tre en cette p&eacute;riode d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration
du ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne de la mondialisation et la polarisation.
La crise actuelle de l'aide n'&eacute;tonne plus dans ce contexte
- et pourrait m&ecirc;me s'av&eacute;rer positive. La soci&eacute;t&eacute;
d'abondance occidentale tente essentiellement de s'accommoder
d'une d&eacute;mystification de son aide au d&eacute;veloppement
s'inscrivant dans son processus de transformation pour l'avenir.
<P>
<A NAME="tro"><H3><hr>Trois strat&eacute;gies de recherche de &quot;nouveaux compromis&quot;</H3></A>
<P>
Comme toujours, le processus de recherche d'un nouveau compromis
au sein d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'abondance est d&eacute;termin&eacute;
&agrave; la fois par l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t propre et l'altruisme.
Trois grandes tendances se dessinent n&eacute;anmoins. La premi&egrave;re,
qui est la plus id&eacute;aliste, implique <I>le r&eacute;tablissement
de l'altruisme</I>. Cette approche, qui vise &agrave; &quot;purger&quot;
l'aide de ses contradictions et compromis politiques et &eacute;conomiques
pervers, issus de plusieurs dizaines d'ann&eacute;es d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
&eacute;go&iuml;stes dict&eacute;s par le n&eacute;ocolonialisme
et la Guerre froide, a d&eacute;j&agrave; eu plusieurs r&eacute;percussions
sur l'aide : premi&egrave;rement, elle a donn&eacute; un nouvel
&eacute;lan &agrave; l'aide humanitaire, qui en est la forme la
plus altruiste, aux d&eacute;pens de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
; deuxi&egrave;mement, elle a conduit &agrave; une &quot;d&eacute;centralisation&quot;
de l'aide en favorisant son acheminement au travers d'organismes
tels que les ONG dont le profil altruiste n'a fait l'objet d'aucun
compromis ; troisi&egrave;mement, elle a entra&icirc;n&eacute;
le d&eacute;mant&egrave;lement de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
en termes de structures id&eacute;alistes-altruistes : &quot;les
femmes et le d&eacute;veloppement&quot;, &quot;la sant&eacute;
des enfants&quot;, &quot;l'environnement&quot; et &quot;la lutte
contre la pauvret&eacute;&quot; sont autant d'exemples de d&eacute;signations
d&eacute;mantel&eacute;es autour desquelles s'organise et se justifie
d&eacute;sormais l'octroi de l'aide ; enfin, elle a suscit&eacute;
une &quot;intellectualisation&quot; de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
dans le but sp&eacute;cifique d'un resserrement de ses objectifs
altruistes : l'approche du cadre logique, le concept de d&eacute;veloppement
durable, l'indice de d&eacute;veloppement humain du PNUD et diverses
exp&eacute;riences de gestion plus transparente des projets sont
autant de moyens con&ccedil;us pour polariser et soutenir les
intentions altruistes qui sous-tendent l'aide.
<P>
La deuxi&egrave;me strat&eacute;gie de recherche d'un nouveau
compromis, qui peut &ecirc;tre r&eacute;sum&eacute;e par le slogan
&quot;<I>g&eacute;rez l'aide comme une entreprise</I>&quot;, aborde
la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement avec beaucoup plus
de scepticisme. L'aide, affirme-t-elle, ne se justifie qu'&agrave;
partir du moment o&ugrave; elle assure le progr&egrave;s et le
d&eacute;veloppement - et tel n'est assur&eacute;ment pas le cas
aujourd'hui. Cette approche est &eacute;tay&eacute;e par la volont&eacute;
obsessionnelle de mesurer le progr&egrave;s &agrave; l'aide d'outils
d'entreprise tels que &quot;la production&quot;, &quot;l'impact&quot;,
&quot;l'efficacit&eacute;&quot;, &quot;les taux de rendement&quot;,
etc. C'est ainsi qu'est n&eacute;e &quot;l'&eacute;valuation&quot;
de l'aide. Cette approche a probablement contribu&eacute; &agrave;
la mise en &eacute;vidence de certaines carences de l'aide qui
ont, &agrave; leur tour, suscit&eacute; des critiques de plus
en plus vives &agrave; l'encontre des organismes et des op&eacute;rateurs
oeuvrant dans ce domaine. La strat&eacute;gie de type &quot;entreprise&quot;
a gagn&eacute; des adeptes suite &agrave; l'incapacit&eacute;
de nombreux pays d'enregistrer de r&eacute;els progr&egrave;s
depuis plusieurs dizaines d'ann&eacute;es. Ses partisans font
valoir que les compromis qui ont entrav&eacute; jusqu'ici l'impact
de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement sont intrins&egrave;quement
li&eacute;s &agrave; sa nature altruiste. En d'autres termes,
une aide altruiste ne donnera que rarement, voire jamais, les
r&eacute;sultats escompt&eacute;s. Cette strat&eacute;gie a d&eacute;j&agrave;
exerc&eacute; une influence &agrave; plusieurs &eacute;gards,
&eacute;tant par exemple &agrave; l'origine du ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne
dit de la &quot;lassitude de l'aide&quot;. Elle a &eacute;galement
incit&eacute; &agrave; rechercher de nouvelles modalit&eacute;s
de coop&eacute;ration en vue d'en accro&icirc;tre les avantages
r&eacute;ciproques, en transformant les liens de coop&eacute;ration
<I>commerciale</I> avec les pays en d&eacute;veloppement, rest&eacute;s
t&eacute;nus tout au long de la Guerre froide, en une coop&eacute;ration
<I>&eacute;conomique</I> en rapide expansion. Enfin, elle a cherch&eacute;
&agrave; renforcer l'impact de l'aide sur la situation &eacute;conomique
et les perspectives de croissance des pays en d&eacute;veloppement
en ayant recours &agrave; des formes d'aide plus ambitieuses et
davantage structurelles.
<P>
La troisi&egrave;me tendance, &agrave; savoir <I>le r&eacute;gionalisme</I>,
est li&eacute;e au processus de mondialisation. Ancr&eacute;e
dans l'instinct de survie de l'homme, cette approche incite les
nations g&eacute;ographiquement proches &agrave; former des coalitions
&quot;strat&eacute;giques&quot;. Depuis la fin de la Guerre froide,
l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement constitue l'un des instruments
privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s des r&eacute;gions riches pour affermir
leur position dans le contexte global. Cette strat&eacute;gie
implique l'encouragement d'un r&eacute;gionalisme &quot;ouvert&quot;
ailleurs dans le monde et d'en tirer parti pour &eacute;tablir
des liens et des interactions favorisant ses propres influences
ou h&eacute;g&eacute;monies. Dans une perspective d'&eacute;conomie
politique internationale, cela &quot;tient la route&quot;. Apr&egrave;s
&ecirc;tre parvenues &agrave; faire accepter le capitalisme et
la d&eacute;mocratie dans le monde des nations, c'est par la consolidation
d'une d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute; dans les autres
pays et r&eacute;gions que les nations puissantes et riches chercheront
&agrave; en obtenir le maximum d'avantages.
<P>
<A NAME="nec"><H3><hr>La n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une vision</H3></A>
<P>
La dynamique &agrave; l'origine de la r&eacute;orientation de
l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;tant mieux comprise, devient-il
possible d'aller plus loin et de concevoir une vision plus politique
des relations futures entre les nations riches et celles qui le
sont moins ?
<P>
Apr&egrave;s avoir travers&eacute; les &quot;crises&quot; de la
d&eacute;colonisation, du fascisme et du communisme, la d&eacute;mocratie
de libre march&eacute; est parvenue &agrave; promouvoir la stabilit&eacute;
et la paix entre les nations et &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de
celles-ci. Son principal atout a probablement &eacute;t&eacute;
sa fonction &quot;capacitante&quot; par laquelle elle a permis
&agrave; un nombre croissant de peuples et de nations de &quot;gagner&quot;
un meilleur avenir. Il semble que ce mod&egrave;le soit effectivement
capable de g&eacute;n&eacute;rer une croissance et un progr&egrave;s
relativement &eacute;quitables - ce qui explique sans doute son
adoption par des pays de plus en plus nombreux. Comme souvent,
toutefois, la force m&ecirc;me du syst&egrave;me contient le germe
de sa faiblesse. Con&ccedil;u comme un m&eacute;canisme &quot;capacitant&quot;,
le syst&egrave;me en arrive &agrave; classer comme &quot;incapables&quot;
ceux qu'il ne parvient pas &agrave; rendre capables. Marginalis&eacute;s
faute de pouvoir participer et contribuer au syst&egrave;me, les
exclus (qu'il s'agisse d'individus ou d'Etats) sont qualifi&eacute;s
de &quot;perdants&quot; et consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme une
charge et une menace aux yeux des &quot;gagnants&quot;. On en
arrive ainsi &agrave; une <I>disparit&eacute;</I> au sein de la
soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<P>
L'exp&eacute;rience des nations les plus riches conduit &agrave;
penser qu'en d&eacute;pit du contexte valorisant cr&eacute;&eacute;
par la d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute;, pr&egrave;s d'un
quart de la population s'av&egrave;re incapable de fonctionner
efficacement, et se trouve donc marginalis&eacute;. On note m&ecirc;me
une hausse du nombre de ceux qui sont frapp&eacute;s par le ch&ocirc;mage,
le sous-emploi et la mis&egrave;re. La disparit&eacute; entra&icirc;ne
toujours un co&ucirc;t pour la soci&eacute;t&eacute; - ce qui
constitue une raison suffisante de la r&eacute;duire autant que
possible. Ce co&ucirc;t prend g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement la forme
de transferts internes gagn&eacute;s par les &quot;gagnants&quot;
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; mais auxquels ils doivent renoncer.
Dans les d&eacute;mocraties de libre march&eacute; &agrave; vocation
sociale, il est admis que la marginalisation engendr&eacute;e
par les carences du mod&egrave;le doit &ecirc;tre limit&eacute;e
et/ou indemnis&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re ad&eacute;quate. Dans
les d&eacute;mocraties de libre march&eacute; plus conservatrices,
l'exclusion est davantage per&ccedil;ue comme une faiblesse de
l'individu que comme celle du syst&egrave;me. Les transferts compensatoires
sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement maintenus au strict minimum afin
d'inciter les gens &agrave; &quot;sortir&quot; de leur situation.
Si ce type de soci&eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;conomise sur les transferts
&quot;par empathie&quot;, elle sera g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
tenue de d&eacute;penser une part au moins aussi importante de
ses ressources pour se d&eacute;fendre contre les menaces li&eacute;es
&agrave; une disparit&eacute; croissante : criminalit&eacute;,
trafic de stup&eacute;fiants et extr&eacute;misme politique, par
exemple.
<P>
Le co&ucirc;t de la disparit&eacute; est politique autant que
financier. Une v&eacute;ritable d&eacute;mocratie se fonde sur
la participation d'une majorit&eacute; repr&eacute;sentative de
ses citoyens. Dans les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s riches, toutefois,
une minorit&eacute; de plus en plus importante cesse de participer
&agrave; la vie politique. Le danger r&eacute;side ici dans le
fait que c'est la m&ecirc;me minorit&eacute; marginalis&eacute;e
et croissante qui s'av&egrave;re &quot;incapable&quot; de contribuer
&agrave; la vie &eacute;conomique qui se retire de la participation
d&eacute;mocratique. Il en r&eacute;sulte une ali&eacute;nation
du syst&egrave;me politique et une &eacute;rosion de la d&eacute;mocratie
au point que sa survie elle-m&ecirc;me s'en trouve menac&eacute;e.
<P>
<A NAME="que"><H3><hr>Quels sont les v&eacute;ritables enjeux?</H3></A>
<P>
Apr&egrave;s avoir conquis la plus grande partie des nations du
monde, le capitalisme de libre march&eacute; entreprend aujourd'hui
de conqu&eacute;rir le <I>monde des nations</I> gr&acirc;ce aux
progr&egrave;s technologiques dans le domaine de la communication,
du transport et de l'informatique. Les &eacute;conomistes ont
largement d&eacute;montr&eacute; que l'interd&eacute;pendance
engendr&eacute;e par la libre concurrence internationale n'&eacute;tait
pas n&eacute;cessairement pr&eacute;judiciable. En effet, le capitalisme
mondial assurant que les id&eacute;es, les initiatives et les
ressources peuvent &ecirc;tre &quot;exploit&eacute;es&quot; partout
dans le monde - l&agrave; o&ugrave; elles engendrent le plus grand
profit - l'interd&eacute;pendance est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
per&ccedil;ue comme un avantage r&eacute;ciproque. Ce qui tend
&agrave; confirmer la th&egrave;se de <I>l'effet capacitant global</I>
du capitalisme de libre march&eacute;, &agrave; savoir que l'adoption
de la d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute; par les nations
moins riches permettrait &agrave; plus d'entre elles d'am&eacute;liorer
le niveau de vie de leur population au cours des quelques prochaines
dizaines d'ann&eacute;es. L'impulsion donn&eacute;e par cet &quot;effet
capacitant&quot; contribuera, &agrave; son tour, &agrave; relancer
le progr&egrave;s dans les pays plus riches.
<P>
Si tel est l'objectif, il devient imp&eacute;ratif qu'une nouvelle
vision inspire progressivement la coop&eacute;ration entre les
pays riches et ceux qui le sont moins. La premi&egrave;re d&eacute;marche
dans ce sens doit &ecirc;tre de d&eacute;finir &quot;le but&quot;
et &quot;l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t&quot; en termes de syst&egrave;me
et de processus plut&ocirc;t qu'en termes de r&eacute;sultat.
L'aspect r&eacute;ellement important est le &quot;potentiel capacitant&quot;
de la d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute; dans le contexte
sp&eacute;cifique des pays moins riches. Il est plus important
de savoir <I>comment</I> on r&eacute;alise et <I>qui</I> r&eacute;alise,
que de savoir <I>ce</I> qui est r&eacute;alis&eacute;. L'objectif
ultime doit &ecirc;tre de veiller &agrave; ce que la d&eacute;mocratie
de libre march&eacute; prenne racine dans les nations moins riches
et qu'elle soit capable de d&eacute;terminer qui fait quoi, et
comment.
<P>
La seconde d&eacute;marche importante doit &ecirc;tre l'optimisation
du &quot;potentiel capacitant&quot; de la d&eacute;mocratie de
libre march&eacute; en faveur des groupes les plus vuln&eacute;rables
au sein des diff&eacute;rentes populations. Comme indiqu&eacute;
plus haut, pr&egrave;s d'un quart des citoyens des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
riches sont des exclus - et ce pourcentage est beaucoup plus &eacute;lev&eacute;
encore dans les pays pauvres. Si elle ne parvient pas &agrave;
rendre &quot;capable&quot; une part significative de ce groupe
marginalis&eacute;, la d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute;
ne prendra pas racine. Et si les pauvres ne peuvent &ecirc;tre
mobilis&eacute;s, la croissance ult&eacute;rieure comportera des
distorsions provoquant des disparit&eacute;s de plus en plus marqu&eacute;es.
<P>
La troisi&egrave;me d&eacute;marche importante est de veiller
&agrave; ce que &quot;l'effet capacitant global&quot; du capitalisme
de libre march&eacute; ne devienne pas le domaine r&eacute;serv&eacute;
du capital d&eacute;r&eacute;glement&eacute; et des &quot;gagnants&quot;
qui le g&egrave;rent, ce qui entra&icirc;nerait de nouvelles formes
d'exploitation et de disparit&eacute;. Il convient d'orienter
les forces conjugu&eacute;es du &quot;capitalisme sans fronti&egrave;res&quot;
et de la &quot;d&eacute;mocratie sans fronti&egrave;res&quot;
de mani&egrave;re &agrave; fa&ccedil;onner une monde v&eacute;ritablement
meilleur dans lequel le nombre de &quot;perdants&quot; diminue
et les disparit&eacute;s s'estompent.
<P>
<A NAME="per"><H3><hr>La perspective historique</H3></A>
<P>
Il est utile, &agrave; ce stade, de revenir un instant sur l'histoire
du capitalisme. La d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute; a
apport&eacute; l'abondance &agrave; un tiers environ de la population
mondiale au cours du dernier si&egrave;cle gr&acirc;ce essentiellement
&agrave; un &quot;arrangement&quot; entre le travail et le capital
dans un contexte capacitant cr&eacute;&eacute; par la production
en s&eacute;rie de type &quot;fordiste&quot; et la consommation
de masse. Il convient aujourd'hui de trouver un arrangement similaire
afin que la d&eacute;mocratie globale de libre march&eacute; puisse
apporter le confort mat&eacute;riel aux deux autres tiers de l'humanit&eacute;
(toujours plus nombreuse) tout en le maintenant pour le tiers
d&eacute;j&agrave; riche. Ce n'est plus un arrangement entre les
capitalistes et les travailleurs qu'il faut rechercher - mais
entre les riches et les moins riches.
<P>
La fordisme a fondamentalement transform&eacute; la part interd&eacute;pendante
du capital et du travail au g&acirc;teau &eacute;conomique en
une part commune - conduisant &agrave; la production d'un g&acirc;teau
plus grand. On peut dire, par analogie, que les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
riches et moins riches doivent d&eacute;velopper ensemble une
part commune dans la production d'un &quot;g&acirc;teau global&quot;
plus grand gr&acirc;ce aux nouvelles technologies et &agrave;
des modes de production plus efficaces et mondialis&eacute;s.
Pour attirer et conserver des investissements capitalistes dans
ces modes de production, il faudra que les structures de la demande
et de la consommation garantissent que les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
plus d&eacute;munies partagent avec les plus riches les avantages
de ces syst&egrave;mes mondiaux de production. Tout comme un &quot;g&acirc;teau
plus grand produit en s&eacute;rie&quot; &eacute;tait fonction
d'une consommation de masse plus importante et plus &eacute;quitable,
un &quot;g&acirc;teau plus grand produit mondialement&quot; sera
toujours davantage fonction d'une consommation plus importante
et plus &eacute;quitable &agrave; l'&eacute;chelon plan&eacute;taire.
L'objectif principal de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement
doit &ecirc;tre, dans ce contexte, de veiller &agrave; ce que
la croissance n&eacute;e de la mondialisation augmente les capacit&eacute;s
et diminue les disparit&eacute;s.
<P>
<A NAME="eff"><H3><hr>L'effet n&eacute;gatif d'une &quot;concurrence du pauvre&quot;</H3></A>
<P>
Pouss&eacute;e par une volont&eacute; puissante d'accumuler du
capital, la mondialisation tend &agrave; promouvoir la concurrence.
Celle-ci est, en principe, une bonne chose mais, faute d'une orientation
valable, elle comporte de multiples risques. On pourrait comparer
ici la conqu&ecirc;te du march&eacute; mondial avec le ruissellement
de l'eau lors d'une crue. L'eau prend toujours le chemin le plus
facile et p&eacute;n&egrave;tre d'abord dans les zones les plus
expos&eacute;es o&ugrave; elle cause les plus grands d&eacute;g&acirc;ts.
De m&ecirc;me, aliment&eacute;e par un capital &quot;d&eacute;r&eacute;glement&eacute;&quot;,
le processus de mondialisation tend &agrave; favoriser la concurrence
l&agrave; o&ugrave; elle est la plus facile - mais pas n&eacute;cessairement
o&ugrave; ses effets sont les plus positifs. Tel est le cas notamment
des pays les moins riches o&ugrave; la mis&egrave;re est exploit&eacute;e
en vue de ce que l'on pourrait appeler &quot;l'avantage concurrentiel
du pauvre&quot; - dans le sens o&ugrave; non seulement il se base
sur la disparit&eacute; mais o&ugrave; il n'est nullement &quot;capacitant&quot;,
au contraire. Le travail des enfants, le tourisme du sexe, le
tourisme pr&eacute;judiciable &agrave; l'environnement, l'abattage
des for&ecirc;ts tropicales, l'exportation de la pollution industrielle
et les abus de propri&eacute;t&eacute; intellectuelle sont autant
d'exemples de concurrence n&eacute;gative n&eacute;e de la disparit&eacute;
globale. Dans un monde en phase de globalisation, une telle &eacute;volution
est pr&eacute;judiciable, &agrave; terme, pour toutes les parties.
Aussi les nations riches comme les nations pauvres ont-elles int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
&agrave; r&eacute;duire l'&eacute;cart qui les s&eacute;pare.
<P>
Tous ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments confirment la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
d'une red&eacute;finition profonde du r&ocirc;le de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, et de l'aide en particulier. Tout au
long de la p&eacute;riode coloniale et de la Guerre froide, la
coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement a &eacute;t&eacute;
progressivement d&eacute;racin&eacute;e et d&eacute;tourn&eacute;e
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Ax&eacute;e sur un programme de plus
en plus complexe et de moins en moins transparent, elle a &eacute;t&eacute;
mise sur orbite par un &eacute;quipage restreint et tr&egrave;s
sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; - pour voler finalement bien au-dessus
de la t&ecirc;te du commun  des citoyens. En d'autres termes,
la soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'abondance a perdu le contact avec l'aide
et la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement. Les m&eacute;dias
sont ponctuellement intervenus pour &quot;r&eacute;tablir le contact&quot;
mais l'attention du grand public n'a g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
&eacute;t&eacute; mobilis&eacute;e que lorsque les choses tournaient
v&eacute;ritablement &agrave; la catastrophe.
<P>
<A NAME="vis"><H3><hr>De la vision &agrave; l'action</H3></A>
<P>
Il est indispensable, si l'on veut que la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
riche et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; pauvre oeuvrent ensemble pour
que la seconde adopte une d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute;
- et l'adopte dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t mutuel - que la premi&egrave;re
reprenne contact avec la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement.
Il faut que les riches soient interpell&eacute;s et rel&egrave;vent
le d&eacute;fi de la transformation de leurs partenaires plus
d&eacute;munis, tout comme le ferait un actionnaire minoritaire
int&eacute;ress&eacute; et cr&eacute;atif. Ils doivent se montrer
dispos&eacute;s &agrave; partager l'abondance des connaissances
et exp&eacute;riences accumul&eacute;es tout au long de leur propre
processus de d&eacute;veloppement. Des gens venus de tous les
horizons du monde d'abondance devraient avoir de meilleures occasions
de dialoguer et de coop&eacute;rer avec leurs homologues moins
favoris&eacute;s -un processus que des r&eacute;seaux de communication
et de transport de plus en plus accessibles et de moins en moins
co&ucirc;teux devraient faciliter. Ce nouveau type d'actionnariat
ne peut toutefois exister si la soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'abondance
ne s'est pr&eacute;alablement impr&eacute;gn&eacute;e de la nouvelle
vision.
<P>
Les donateurs devraient apporter un soutien majeur &agrave; ce
processus. Plut&ocirc;t que de consacrer l'essentiel de leur temps
et de leurs ressources &agrave; d&eacute;finir le champ d'application
et le contenu de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement,
ne vaudrait-il pas mieux qu'ils redescendent sur terre ? Ils doivent
devenir les interm&eacute;diaires et les promoteurs de la coop&eacute;ration.
La premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape est l'&eacute;loge de la nouvelle
vision. Puis, l'impulsion &eacute;tant donn&eacute;e, ils deviendront
de v&eacute;ritables &quot;courtiers&quot;, agissant comme catalyseurs
entre les riches et les moins riches pour faciliter leur coop&eacute;ration
&quot;capacitante&quot;. L'acquisition de ce nouveau profil et
de cette nouvelle approche exigera probablement des donateurs
une modification prodonde de leur m&eacute;thode de travail. Il
faut qu'ils se rapprochent de leurs mandants, et qu'ils assument
une responsabilisation d&eacute;mocratique.
<P>
Comme indiqu&eacute; plus haut, le concept de coop&eacute;ration
capacitante est ax&eacute; sur qui fait quoi, et comment. Son
but essentiel doit donc &ecirc;tre la mobilisation des forces
d&eacute;mocratiques et de libre march&eacute; dans les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
moins riches. Cette approche pr&eacute;sente l'avantage que le
changement et le progr&egrave;s seront essentiellement induits
de l'int&eacute;rieur de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; concern&eacute;e
- la coop&eacute;ration &eacute;tant une source d'encouragement.
Cette approche implique par ailleurs l'acceptation du fait que
le rythme du progr&egrave;s doit &ecirc;tre davantage d&eacute;termin&eacute;
par les forces capacitantes des d&eacute;mocraties et des libres
march&eacute;s en formation, aussi faibles et imparfaits qu'ils
puissent encore para&icirc;tre. La coop&eacute;ration doit avoir
pour premier objectif d'affermir ces forces et devra, &agrave;
cette fin, passer les r&eacute;sultats techniques au second plan
au profit d'un affinement du syst&egrave;me et du processus. Le
changement doit aller au-del&agrave; des m&eacute;thodologies
pour transformer &eacute;galement la mentalit&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration.
Ainsi, par exemple, les donateurs devraient favoriser une coop&eacute;ration
&quot;modeste mais intelligente&quot;. La promotion des &quot;bonnes
pratiques&quot; peut constituer, elle aussi, une mani&egrave;re
cr&eacute;ative d'assurer une coop&eacute;ration capacitante.
Certaines techniques d&eacute;cisionnelles li&eacute;es aux r&eacute;sultats
devront incontestablement &ecirc;tre conserv&eacute;es - mais
il conviendra de les adapter de mani&egrave;re cr&eacute;ative
&agrave; une approche davantage &quot;capacitante&quot;.
<P>
En conclusion, cette vision nouvelle implique la prise de conscience
des imperfections de la d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute;,
conjugu&eacute;e &agrave; la conviction du potentiel &eacute;norme
qu'elle offre aux pays les plus d&eacute;munis de la plan&egrave;te.
Trouver de nouveaux compromis en mati&egrave;re d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
signifie une r&eacute;orientation de cette aide afin qu'elle favorise
l'adoption et l'adaptation d'une d&eacute;mocratie de libre march&eacute;
hautement &quot;capacitante&quot; dans les pays moins riches.
On en viendrait ainsi &agrave; un syst&egrave;me de solidarit&eacute;
internationale qui oeuvrerait pour la d&eacute;mocratie de libre
march&eacute; plut&ocirc;t que de s'y substituer.

<h2>FOURTH WORLD CONFERENCE ON WOMEN</h2>


<h3>CLOSING STATEMENT BY PIERRE SANE, SECRETARY GENERAL</h3> 


Over the past two weeks, we have heard many governments say that this conference should be about action and not words, about reality and not rhetoric.

Those are their words, not ours. But I couldn't agree more. 
<p>
The Platform for Action that will emerge from the discussions over these 10 days will set out the agenda for improving the lives -- and the human rights -- of women worldwide. 
<p>
What governments actually do over the 1500 plus days to the end of the century will show whether they are committed to achieving Equality by the Year 2000.
<p>
The first step, of course, is to have a strong and clear Platform.
<p>
On Amnesty International's first day in Beijing, we set out our demands from the conference. Even though discussions are continuing as I speak, at this stage it looks like on paper those demands have been met.
<p>
Our demands to the conference were for governments to: 
<p>
<ul><li>reaffirm the commitment they made two years ago to the universality and indivisibility of the human rights of women
<p>
<li>recognize the violence that women suffer at the hands of the state and make a commitment to ending that violence, bringing perpetrators to justice and paying compensation to victims.
<p>
<li>state that rape in armed conflict is a human rights violation, and make a commitment to live up to international humanitarian and human rights law during armed conflict 
<p>
<li>make a commitment to work towards eradicating violence, like female genital mutilation, in family and society. 
<p>
<li>make a strong commitment that all human rights of women activists would be guaranteed
<p>
<li>and step up their efforts to ratify and implement international treaties that have an impact on the human rights of women
</ul><p>
In a few words, this is a document that Amnesty International can do business with to hold governments accountable. 
<p>
And getting down to business is exactly what governments and the United Nations now need to do.
<p>
Governments must now state clearly how and when they will implement the action set out in the Platform. 
<p>
We will be watching to see if, for example, they do ratify and implement international standards, bring perpetrators of torture, "disappearances" and political killings to justice, and stop the human rights violations of women activists. 
<p>
The United Nations must now integrate action on women into all of its activities, including by placing higher priority on human rights violations against women.
<p>
But as I said earlier, discussions are still underway and threats are still looming.
<p>
First, the threat that in the final stages of debate governments will not pull together what they have agreed so far, and will weaken the final Platform. This includes the debate over "respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds".
<p>
Second, the threat that governments will lodge reservations to the agreed Platform, effectively picking and choosing what areas of the Platform they will work on. 
<p>
And finally, the threat that when governments leave Beijing they will not put the Platform INTO action. 
<p>
<hr width=80%>
<p>

On our first day in Beijing, I said that we have come here to campaign on the human rights of women and the results so far show the effects of that campaigning.
<p>
But I also said Amnesty International would not be silent on human rights violations in China.
<p>
Not only because we are here in China, but also because China has over one fifth of the world's population and an emerging global economic force. This places a special responsibility on the government to make sure that human rights are not denied to one fifth of humanity.
<p>
Progress has been made in moving towards freedom from want, but freedom from fear is still not a right of the Chinese people. 
<p>
Since we arrived in this country, Amnesty International members appealed directly to the Chinese authorities on human rights violations in China .
<p>
Thousands and thousands of urgent appeals on death sentences, imminent executions, and prisoners of conscience. 
<p>

And appeals for Ding Zilin and her husband Jiang Peikun, who were arrested and reportedly accused of "economic irregularities" on 18 August. According to one source, however, the real reason for their arrest was to prevent Ding Zilin from making contact with people attending the World Conference on Women. She is reported to be held in Wuxi. 
<p>
Ding Zilin is not alone. Since the start of the conference, the relatives of at least seven activists have been under virtual house arrest to prevent them from making contact with participants at the forum and conference. 
<p>
For some of these mothers and wives of activists and prisoners of conscience this has meant 24-hour surveillance, reporting telephone conversations, and in one case being ordered to join her husband in prison.
<p>
One of these women, Wang Lingyun, the mother of student leader and prisoner of conscience Wang Dan, has apparently been under constant surveillance since 26 August to prevent "foreigners who are attending the women's conference from visiting the family".
<p>
Before we leave Beijing, we will be raising our concerns will the Chinese authorities about this harassment, by letter or in a meeting.
<p>
While we have been here, the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Tibet Autonomous Region was marked on 1 September. In the run up to that anniversary, dozens of people were arrested and some are reported to have been tortured. We are continuing our investigations into this crackdown.
<p>
<hr width=80%>
<p>

These human rights violations are not, of course, unique to China.
<p>
Harassment of relatives of activists, suppression of political dissent and state executions blacken the human rights records of governments around the world. And the victims as often as not are women.
<p>
We showed this repression earlier this year when we published this report on human rights violations against women, and during the NGO Forum here when we collected signatures on petitions for a dozen women who are victims of those violations.
<p>
Indeed, our involvement in this World Conference on Women has strengthened our conviction that human rights violations against women must be better identified, documented, publicized and stopped.
<p>
It is for those women that we are speaking. And for those women that radical action is needed to end human rights violations.

<p>
<B>The development experience of much of sub-Saharan Africa in past
decades provides ample illustration of the importance of capacity building in
the development process. The importance is related to the ability to manage
economic and social proccesses, including the analysis and formulation of
policy options, for attaining development objectives such as employment
generation and poverty reduction. The consequences of failures in domestic
economic management, compounded by the effects of a prolonged
economic crisis in the region have, inter alia, contributed to high and rising
levels of open unemployment and underemployment, declining per capita
incomes and real wages, and and increase in the incidence and intensity of
poverty in a number of African countries. The persistence of these adverse
consequences, which represent a serious threat to economic growth and
sustainable development, are somehow linked - either as a cause or an
effect - to weaknesses and instability in the institutional framework for
management and public administration.</b>
<p>
The problem of weak institutional and general capacity for management in Africa
today can be traced to the colonial legacy. This left many countries in the region,
at the time of independence, with insufficient institutional and human capacity to
cope with the transition from colony to independent sovereign state, particularly
with respect to the responsibility for economic management. More specifically, this
related to the unequal and disadvantageous manner of Africa's incorporation into
the international economic system in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Lack of
technological know-how, inadequate infrastructure and limited investment
resources compounded the immediate post-independence problem of weak
institutional capacity, and left many African countries highly vulnerable to external
shocks.
<p>
     It was extremely difficult for the majority of African countries to break out of
the old 'protected' colonial production and trade system and rapidly to diversify
their economies in line with the requirements of participating effectively in a
competitive world economy. Since independence, institutional and human capacity
for management in many African countries has not grown fast enough to keep up
with the requirements of changing socio-economic circumstances at the national
level and to face the challenge of increasing globalisation. Critical skill shortages
in public administration and private sector management in Africa can hardly be
addressed in the context of the current economic crisis. The consequences of this
crisis can be seen, for example, in underfunded and poorly equipped training and
management development institutions, and in low-paid and demoralised civil
services. At the same time, the 'brain drain' from the continent, partly as a
consequence of poor pay and career prospects, has further undermined capacity
in Africa. The interaction of foreign donors and African governments has not
always served the interest of capacity building. It has been admitted, even by the
World Bank that 'aid has done much less than one might have hoped to reduce
poverty (in Africa)'. There is now more or less a consensus in the international
donor community that expatriate technical assistance does not and cannot solve
all kinds of development problems in the region. Far from solving problems, the
imposition of foreign technical assistance has, in some cases, become a
destructive force which undermines the development of domestic capacity that is
critical to solving local development problems. Where donor assistance is
inappropriate in terms of project concept and design, or there is a mismatch
between design and domestic implementation and management capacity, technical
assistance could end up becoming part of the problem rather than the solution.
<p>
<h3>Conceptual issues</h3>
<p>
     Before examining the requirements for institutional capacity building in
developing countries, and particularly African countries, it is necessary to clarify
salient issues pertaining to the concept. Broadly speaking, capacity building in a
development context refers to a comprehensive process which includes the ability
to identify constraints and to plan and manage development. The process usually
involves the development of human resources and institutions, and a supportive
policy environment. Ideally, it aims at improving on existing capabilities and
resources and using them efficiently to achieve sustainable economic and social
development.
<p>
     Narrowing the concept to focus on institution-building, the emphasis will be
on the development of particular institutions, their human and material resources,
their organisational management and their administrative capacities. More
specifically, the aim of institutional capacity building is to improve significantly the
outputs and impacts of institutions concerned with economic management, public
administration (including project management), enterprise development and so on
- in both the public and private sectors.
<p>
     It is obvious that relevant development-oriented institutions within an
economy can exert a decisive influence on economic growth and employment
prospects, and indeed on the attainment of sustainable economic and social
development. From a macro-economic standpoint, planning and similar
development institutions are required for better management of the economy
including, more crucially, the ability to mobilise, allocate and utilise human and
material resources in an efficient and productive manner. At the micro level,
human and institutional capacity is critical to sound project management and
public administration.
<p>
<h3>The framework</h3>
<p>
     The general situation in Africa today suggests that capacity building is
required in relation to the following priority areas:
<ul>
<li>good governance, to ensure stability;
<li>economic management, to maximise resource mobilisation and promote
sustainable development;
<li>human resource development, to support employment creation and income
generation, and reduce poverty;
<li>science and technology, to increase the efficiency of the population and
facilitate infrastructural development;
<li>enterprise development, to enhance the critical role of the private sector in
overall development.
</ul><p>
     The degree of emphasis given to each of the above in a given context
would vary according to the level and complexity of existing human and
institutional capacities, the economic and financial means to support capacity, the
relative roles of the public and private sectors, and the degree of involvement of
civil society in the decision-making process.
<p>
     The policy context for institutional capacity building should be multi-sectoral
and flexible but coherent in relation to the desired objectives of development. This
is to ensure that the process of capacity building is adaptable to changing
circumstances - an issue that is particularly relevant in the context of countries
undertaking structural adjustment and economic reform programmes when there is
a need effectively to nurture and utilise local skills and to mobilise investment
resources efficiently.
<p>
     In the light of the development challenge facing African countries, the
process of capacity building in the region requires, above all, appropriate and
adequate human and institutional capabilities to plan and manage economic and
social development processes. These capabilities should include the means of
assessing the achievements and impact of capacity building on poverty reduction,
employment creation, etc. Existing public sector institutions for development
planning and management could provide the operational framework for national
capacity building, but the process should also include the participation of diverse
social forces, the private sector and non-governmental institutions.
<p>
     Regarding the role of external donors and technical assistance agencies,
the approach should be based on the concept of 'partners in development', which
implies consultation and dialogue between donor and recipient on all aspects of
project planning, design and implementation - with project 'ownership' resting with
national authorities. Technical assistance from foreign donors should therefore go
mainly towards developing the necessary domestic capacity, rather than
contributing to the undermining of existing or potential capacity. Furthermore,
assistance provided by external donors should be directed towards the building of
capacity for promoting regional economic cooperation and integration through
support for the development of viable African regional and sub-regional
development organisations.
<p>
<h3>Support initiatives</h3>
<p>
     The issue of domestic capacity building in Africa has more recently been
the focus of attention by the international community as a whole. Indeed, the
former World Bank vice-president for Africa, Edward Jaycox, has described
'capacity building' as the 'missing link in African development' which is 'critical to
the development effort (of the region) and the chances of success'. UN agencies,
spearheaded by the UNDP, have been active in promoting capacity building as a
major requirement for attaining sustainable development.
<p>
     In 1991, the UNDP Governing Council took a decision which resulted in the
development of guidelines covering assistance to governments in the formulation
and implementation of national capacity building strategies relating to all stages of
the project cycle in the developing countries. The decision coincided with the
introduction of the 'programme approach' by the UNDP which emphasised the
centrality of national development programmes as the hub for the integration of
UN technical assistance activities with national efforts. Emphasis on the use of
national skills in the development process was consolidated within the general
operational framework for 'national execution', which implied that overall
responsibility for management of UN operational activities and accountability
remained with the government and other national institutions and beneficiaries
who 'owned' these activities. Under these new arrangements, a high priority was
thus placed on the strengthening and sustaining of development management and
administrative capacities on a long-term basis as an integral part of UNDP
technical assistance.
<p>
     The World Bank's interest in capacity building in Africa has been more
closely linked to the need for administrative and technical capacity at the national
level to carry out policy analysis and economic management in the context of on-
going structural adjustment and economic reform programmes. In a pathbreaking
address to the African-American Institute Conference in 1993, Mr Jaycox came out
strongly in favour of a new approach to lending to African countries which gave
top priority to the development of critical human and institutional capacity. He
admitted that the Bank's $4 billion a year lending programme in sub-Saharan
Africa had not had the desired impact on development in the region because not
enough attention had been paid to national capacity in the past. He went on to
criticise the international donor community and financial institutions, including the
World Bank itself, for designing and carrying out technical assistance activities
which not only fail to solve problems but end up undermining the development of
capacity in Africa. Mr Jaycox accordingly pledged to give direct support to capacity
building in the Bank's lending programmes, mainly through human resource
development and the creation of a 'demand for professionalism' in Africa.
<p>
     The UNDP, the African Development Bank and the World Bank collaborated
in the early 1990s to set up the 'African Capacity Building Foundation' (ACBF),
based in Harare, Zimbabwe, with initial seed money of about $30 million and
another $70 million attracted from bilateral donors and African governments
themselves. The fund is to be used by the Foundation to support capacity building
in Africa through training and institution building. Particular attention will be paid to
the rehabilitation and strengthening of selected research and training institutions to
meet the challenge of indigenous capacity building. Another initiative set up with
foreign donors and African support, the Africa Research Consortium in Nairobi, is
a good example of collaboration at regional level that is contributing to capacity
building in the critical area of economic policy analysis and management.
Similarly, the African Development Bank helped establish the African Business
Round table which promotes entrepreneurship and enterprise development based
on African ownership and control.
<p>
<h3>Role of the ILO</h3>
<p>
     For well over three decades the ILO, as part of its technical cooperation
programme in Africa, has been involved in a wide range of management
development, productivity and institution-building initiatives at both national and
regional levels. This is consistent with the need to strengthen African training
institutions to play a crucial role in providing development managers with the
necessary skills to analyse and formulate policy options and manage public and
private enterprises efficiently.
<p>
     One of the most successful initiatives undertaken by the ILO, in
collaboration with the UNDP and the Economic Development Institute (EDI) of the
World Bank, is the UNEDIL programme for strengthening management training in
Africa. Since its inception in 1987, the UNEDIL programme has proven to be a
worthwhile initiative in institutional capacity building in the management field.
Support for the programme has also come from national and regional
management development institutes (MDIs) in Africa, regional and sub-regional
organisations such as SADC and the Commonwealth Secretariat, and major
bilateral donors such as USAID, CIDA, NORAD, the Netherlands and France.
<p>
     Apart from aiming at strengthening institutional capacity, the UNEDIL
programme has been instrumental at fostering networking among African
development institutes and promoting professional contacts and the exchange of
experience. One outcome of the programme has been the revival of three
subregional MDI associations which enjoy the direct support of UNEDIL and serve
as focal points for UNEDIL's subregional networking arrangements.
<p>
     Networking on a subregional basis has made it possible to optimise the use
of scarce resources and talents, and this has helped to increase managerial
capacity in the region as a whole. Collaboration has also permitted an exchange of
experience among African institutions, and has brought together expertise both
from within Africa and from outside to assist in the development of managerial
capacity across the continent. This fits in with the goals of technical cooperation in
general, and of South-South cooperation in particular.

<H1>US knew of contacts between Kurds
and Baghdad, analyst says</H1>

<P>By JOHN WEST</P>

<P>LONDON, September 6 - United States diplomats knew for at least a
year about contacts between a Kurdish faction and the Iraqi
government which led to this week's international crisis over Iraq, a
senior Middle Eastern analyst said on Thursday in an Internet
discussion with OutThere news service.</P>

<P>The Iraqi army helped the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) to drive
its rival, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), out of Arbil last
Saturday. The city lies in a UN "no-fly zone" imposed on Kurdish
areas of northern Iraq after the Gulf War in 1991 to protect Kurds
from the Baghdad government, and the United States reacted by
launching cruise missile attacks on Iraqi military installations.
</P>

<P><A HREF="kopietz.html">Hans-Heino Kopietz</A>, a political risk
analyst who has worked with the International Institute of Strategic
Studies, said: "The Americans had known for at least the last year,
that is the summer of 1995 until now, and I stress at least, about
contacts between (KDP leader Massoud) Barzani and (Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister) Tareq Aziz. I know personally the go-between in
this."</P>

<P>He was speaking the day before Britain's Independent newspaper
published what it said were extracts of leaked correspondence between
the KDP and Washington in recent weeks.</P>

<P>Kopietz, who visited Kurdistan earlier this year and knows Iraqi
Kurdish leaders from all factions, also predicted that inter-Kurdish
fighting, intense interest by Iraq's neighbours Turkey and Iran, and
a renewed Iraqi government presence in northern Iraq could eventually
create another refugee exodus like the one in 1991 which originally
provoked the Gulf War allies to make the area a "safe haven".</P>

<P>"The Kurdish population is so frightened and so insecure," said
Kopietz, who in 1990 advised Kurdish parties on establishing a system
of parliamentary democracy. "We will have another crisis, human
rights crisis, if the Americans will push the confrontation with Arab
Iraq further... The Kurds will flee again and the Kurds will yet
again suffer but this will not only be due to Western powers but to
Kurdish leaders."</P>

<P>The picture that emerged that from three Internet discussions
organised by OutTherethis week was of a local conflict that suddenly
spiralled out of control when the KDP tried to force Washington's
hand by appealing to Iraq to enter the no-fly zone.</P>

<P>The KDP's <A HREF="kdp.html">Burhan Jaf</A> said on Wednesday that
the party was "not disturbed at all" by the crisis because "we
contributed in bringing the Kurdish situation to the world again". He
said the two Kurdish factions agreed on many points and the KDP was
willing to take part in US-sponsored peace talks. His rival,
<A HREF="puk.html">Sarbast Hussein</A> of the PUK, appealed on
Tuesday for the West to extend the no-fly zone further south and lift
the UN economic sanctions on Iraq for the Kurdish areas. Jaf said he
agreed with the demands.</P>

<P>But now that the Iraqi government has re-established a presence
inside Kurdistan, it may be difficult for the United States to
restore the largely independent administration the Kurds had enjoyed
under Western protection. Hussain's call for the leaders of the KDP
to be "punished" before a full reconciliation can be reached between
the two parties does not bode well for any peace talks.</P>

<P>Answering a question from an Internet user called Pushdaree, Jaf
said the KDP was happy to restrict its gains to the city of Arbil and
would not extend the fighting further south to the PUK stronghold of
Sulaimaniya. But there are already reports of fresh fighting outside
Arbil and Kopietz estimated that although Iraq has now withdrawn its
uniformed troops, it will have left behind a heavy contingent of
intelligence officers who will now fan out across the autonomous
areas to reestablish Baghdad's influence.</P>

<P>For full details, please see the transcripts of OutThere's live
discussions with <A HREF="puk.html">Sarbast Hussein</A>,
<A HREF="kdp.html">Burhan Jaf</A> and

<P></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>This is an edited transcript of OutThere news
service's live interview with Hans-Heino Kopietz, an independent
security consultant and expert on Kurdish affairs, on Thursday
September 5, 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle, OutThere news service:</B> Welcome to OutThere's
third live Net discussion on the crisis in Kurdistan. Today's guest
is Hans-Heino Kopietz, one of the world's leading experts on Kurdish
affairs.</P>

<P>Mr Kopietz is an independent international and security
consultant. He has had a long career as an academic and analyst. He
has lectured at the American University of Beirut, Ahmadu Bello
University in Nigeria and the School of Oriental and African Studies
in London. He has worked as a researcher and analyst at the
International Institute of Strategic Studies in London and as an
international affairs and security consultant at Control Risk Group.
</P>

<P>Mr Kopietz's work and study have involved him closely in Kurdistan
for the last 15 years. He knows the key players personally and met
them all earlier this year during a visit to Iraqi Kurdistan when he
was reporting for German television.</P>

<P>Mr Kopietz, why do you think the Kurdish Democratic Party took the
risk of appealing for military help from the Iraqi government, which
it has been fighting on and off for nearly 30 years?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>This was not a risk. The KDP had negotiated
since August September 1995 with the central government of Iraq and
Mr Massoud Barzani's principle intention always has been to eliminate
the stronghold of the PUK led by Jalal Talabani. Without Iraqi
military assistance he could not do it. Further, Mr Barzani was well
aware of the US policy. He had advised the United States nine days
before the Iraqis came into Arbil, and he was told that he would not
in any way be bombarded by American aircraft. Instead the United
States would give comfort to him and to Baghdad.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Are you suggesting that the US connived in
Barzani's action against the PUK, then?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>Absolutely, absolutely.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Why - because the PUK had invited Iranian
support?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> The Iranian political and military presence
is minimal. Ideologically and religiously, the Iranians have never
made a big impact into Kurdistan because nearly 90 percent of
Kurdistan is Sunni, but four or six percent are Christians and
related faiths,and Iran doesn't have a chance of ever getting a
religious foothold in Kurdistan. It's a question of the Iranians
wanting to use political influence, which has nothing to do with
religion. It's a question of the PUK being identified as being
supported by Iran. So I would say yes, that's why the American
connived at Barzani's action. But there are other reasons too. It's
better for America to have ONE leader of Kurdistan and they have
decided to nominate Barzani because the Barzani family has an old
name in the 20th century as leaders of Kurdistan. The Americans are
more comfortable with traditions and traditional authority.Talabani
is so-called 'progressive'. He originally was a communist, a radical.
He's taciturn, unpredictable and vociferous. It's very difficult to
negotiate with Jalal and I have known him for many years. For any
government in the world it would be difficult to deal with him
because he's a radical.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> So the KDP's action in Arbil had been prepared
over many months, and the KDP appeal to Iraq was not a sudden act of
desperation?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>Indeed, it was not a sudden act of
desperation. Barzani had an agreement with Mr Talabani since 1992 and
the proof of the pudding is that Mr Barzani agreed for the Iraqi oil
minister to cross KDP-held territory in January 1996 for the express
purpose to reopen the pipelines between Baghdad and Turkey. In return
for this permission, Mr Barzani received at the minimum 18 armoured
personnel carriers, unknown quantities of ammunition and some
intelligent military personnel. I do not know what else he obtained.
</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>And the Americans knew about these contacts
between the KDP and Baghdad?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> Yes. The Americans had known for AT LEAST
the last year, that is the summer of 1995 until now, and I stress AT
LEAST, about the contacts between Mr Barzani and Mr Tareq Aziz. I
know personally the go-between in this. His meeting took place in
February 1996. And considering there is a station of some 50 CIA
agents in Salahuddin, it would be almost criminal if they had not
known - a station that is 100 metres from Mr Barzani's compound.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>What was the benefit to the Iraqi government of
the agreement with the KDP?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>The benefit was very simple. It gave a
licence under the cover of the KDP to reenter legitimately northern
Iraq above the 36th parallel.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> What sort of a person is Massoud Barzani?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> Massoud Barzani, it must be remembered, is
the head and senior son of the legendary Mullah Barzani. He himself
is very quiet, a non-drinker, non-smoker. That is his outward
appearance. What he is in public is essentially a conspirator in the
tradition of Kurdish politics. He himself had lived in Iran until
1991. .. and he himself had to learn what he is leading. He was a man
who did not know his own people but had to learn very fast. He is a
very shy man, a very elegant man in Kurdish terms, and importantly,
he wears always traditional clothes, unlike Jalal Talabani. He always
presents himself as the leader of the traditional families of
Kurdistan. His brother died at the end of the 80s and he inherited
the mantle of Mullah Barzani. There are other sons from other women,
but his mother is the one that counts and he inherited the mantle
when his brother died.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> After the Gulf War ended in 1991 the Kurds were
enabled by the West to set up an autonomous administration with an
elected parliament. Why do you think this experiment collapsed?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>The Kurds are their own worst enemies.
Indeed, the Kurds were given the chance to present themselves as a
so-called democratic experiment and I was one of the advisers from
1990 before the war in that experiment. There are deep-seated
conflicts within Kurdish society, you may call it tribal, religious,
ideological differences, but the basic contest between Jalal Talabani
and Massoud Barzani is over money and power. It is very sad for me to
say that as one of those involved but the families of the leaders are
nepotistic. Every single adviser to each leader are relatives and it
is sad they could not produce a consensus. The basic problem is a
lack of institutions and that is the fault of the Iraqi political
system.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> The KDP's Burhan Jaf said last night his party
wanted a peace agreement with the PUK and a return to the
parliamentary democracy set up after the Gulf War. Do you think this
can be achieved, and if so, how?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> Unfortunately the leaders persist in living
in a never-never land and have not yet been able to come out of their
misperception of international politics. So there can be no return to
democracy. In fact democracy never really existed.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> The Turkish government said today that it would
like to establish a 'security zone' inside northern Iraq to prevent
cross-border attacks by the Turkish Kurds of the PKK. What is the
relationship between the PKK and the Iraqi Kurdish groups?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> The Turkish Kurdish problem is far removed
from the Iraqi, Iranian and Syrian Kurds. The PKK under Mr Ocalan has
taken a very different route to autonomy, independence or whatever
you may want to call it. He has decided to take a violent course...
Turkey looks at all Kurds as interrelated, as one ethnic
group,therefore they see Kurds in Iraq, Iran and Syria as the same as
the PKK. The PKK's ties to Iraqi groups vary from time to time.
Sometimes they're close to the PUK, sometimes to the KDP but they all
fight each other. There are tactical alliances. It all depends on the
regional political constellation at any one time.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> How will the Iraqi oil-for-food deal affect the
Kurds in northern Iraq? Which groups stand to benefit from it?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>I will be very cynical. No group in Iraq
will benefit because all oil for food contracts will be delivered to
Tikrit. That's why the United States, Britain and many others are
holding back. About 70 percent of all past humanitarian aid to Iraq
always ended up in the city of Tikrit, from where Saddam comes.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Could you already see this crisis brewing when
you visited Kurdistan earlier this year? What were the signs on the
ground then?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> It became very clear to me as far back as
January 1995 when the PUK decided unilaterally to invade and adopt
Arbil. Later the fighting between these groups, be it for tribal
reasons or ideological reasons, was a very clear sign. In January
1996 it also became clear that the American confrontation with Iran
was heading towards a crescendo. We knew that the Kurds have been and
will be the football of Middle Eastern power struggles.
Unfortunately, the Kurds permit themselves to be in that role.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Now that Saddam's forces have been able to
enter the Kurdish areas, do you think they will stay permanently? For
instance, do you believe reports that Iraqi intelligence agents are
still in Arbil in force and likely to remain there?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz:</B> First, Iraqi Arab intelligence agents always
have been in north Iraq. Second, if one has a division of uniform
military personnel of whatever number and size, then half of them
will be intelligence services. When the tanks and the uniform
regiments return they will leave behind half of their men and
equipment. There's no doubt that half of those who came in were left
behind as intelligence. These men have very specific tasks, to root
out the opposition to the KDP, say PUK supporters, and in my
knowledge there will be at least 2-5,000 intelligence officers in the
KDP's regions in order to finish the PUK. The whole purpose of the
exercise was to eliminate Jalal Talabani and his PUK and that they
will do now with a vengeance and great ruthlessness.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle:</B> How do you predict that the situation will
develop over the next three to six months?</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>Kurdistan is a political vacuum right now
and it has been a vacuum for at least five years if not before. I'm
not a prophet, I cannot say what will happen. I can only say what
could happen. Turkey and Iran both have strategic reasons to be in
the region. Iraq will resist this, and as a member of the United
Nations, Saddam Hussein has every right to defend the territorial
integrity of Iraq. Yet it is very possible that Turkey and Iran will
interfere with this because they see the oil and gas advantages. The
game is all about money and power in this region.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Do you think there is a risk of a refugee
crisis like that of 1991 caused by the present conflict in Kurdistan?
</P>

<P><B>Heino Kopietz: </B>The Kurdish population is so frightened and
so insecure, the answer to your question is definitely yes. We will
have another crisis, human rights crisis, if the Americans will push
the confrontation with Arab Iraq further... The Kurds will flee again
and the Kurds will yet again suffer but this will not only be due to
Western powers but to Kurdish leaders.</P>

<P><B>Paul Eedle: </B>Thank you very much indeed, Mr Kopietz, for
joining OutThere today for this live interview.</P>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>The Stories We Tell<br>George Gerbner</b></font>

<p>

<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5>Most of what we know, or think we know, we have never personally experienced. We live in a world erected by the stories we hear and see and tell. Unlocking incredible riches through imagery and words, conjuring up the unseen through art, creating towering works of imagination and fact through science, poetry, song, tales, reports and laws - that is the true magic of human life<p>

	Today that age-old process faces enormous and insidious challenges in the form of entertainment violence that wrecks attempts to promote a culture of peace. The following article explores what might be done to diversify, pacify, democratize and humanize the mainstream story-telling process that shapes the cultural environment in which we live </font>

<p>











Through the magic of stories we live in a world much wider than the threats and gratifications of the immediate physical environment, which is the world of other species. Stories socialize us into roles of gender, age, class, vocation and lifestyle, and offer models of conformity or targets for rebellion. They weave the seamless web of the cultural environment that cultivates most of what we think, what we do, and how we conduct our affairs.<p>

	The story-telling process used to be hand-crafted, home-made, community-inspired. Now it is mostly mass-produced and policy-driven. It is the end result of a complex manufacturing and marketing process. The situation calls for a new diagnosis and a new prescription.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Revelation, description and advice</b></font><br>
The stories that animate our cultural environment have three distinct but related functions. These functions are (1) to reveal how things work; (2) to describe what things are; and (3) to tell us what to do about them.<p>

	Stories of the first kind, revealing how things work, illuminate the all-important but invisible relationships and hidden dynamics of life. Fairy tales, novels, plays, comics, cartoons, and other forms of creative imagination and imagery are the basic building blocks of human understanding. They show complex causality by presenting imaginary action in total situations, coming to some conclusion that has a moral purpose and a social function. You don't have to believe the 'facts' of Little Red Riding Hood to grasp the notion that big bad 'wolves' victimize old women and trick little girls - a lesson in gender roles, fear, and power.<p>

	Stories of the first kind build, from infancy on, the fantasy we call reality. I do not suggest that the revelations are false, which they may or may not be, but that they are synthetic, selective, often mythical, and always socially constructed.<p>

	Stories of the second kind depict what things are. These are descriptions, depictions, expositions, reports abstracted from total situations and filling in with 'facts' the fantasies conjured up by stories of the first kind. They are the presumably factual accounts, the chronicles of the past and the news of today.<p>

	Stories of what things are may confirm or deny some conception of how things work. Their high 'facticity' (i.e. correspondence to actual events presumed to exist independently of the story) gives them special status in political theory and often in law. They give emphasis and credibility to selected parts of each society's fantasies of reality. They convey information about finance, weddings, crime, lotteries, terrorists, etc. They alert us to certain interests, threats, opportunities and challenges.<p>

	Stories of the third kind tell us what to do. These are stories of value and choice. They present things, behaviours or styles of life as desirable (or undesirable), propose ways to obtain (or avoid) them, and the price to be paid for attainment (or failure). They are the instructions, laws, regulations, cautionary tales, commands, slogans, sermons, and exhortations. Today most of them are called commercials and other advertising messages and images we see and hear every day.<p>

	Stories of the third kind clinch the lessons of the first two and turn them into action. They typically present an objective to be sought or to be avoided, and offer a product, service, candidate, institution or action purported to help attain or avoid it. The lessons of fictitious Little Red Riding Hoods and their more realistic sequels prominent in everyday news and entertainment not only teach lessons of vulnerability, mistrust and dependence but also help sell burglar alarms, more jails and executions promised to enhance security (which they rarely do), and other ways to adjust to a structure of power.<p>

	Ideally, the three kinds of stories check and balance each other. But in a commercially driven culture, stories of the third kind pay for most of the first two. That creates a coherent cultural environment whose overall function is to provide a hospitable and effective context for stories that sell. With the coming of the electronic age, that cultural environment is increasingly monopolized, homogenized, and globalized. We must then look at the historic course of our journey to see what this new age means for us and our children.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Defining communities</b></font><br>
For the longest time in human history, stories were told only face to face. A community was defined by the rituals, mythologies and imageries held in common. All useful knowledge was encapsulated in aphorisms and legends, proverbs and tales, incantations and ceremonies. Writing was rare and holy, forbidden for slaves. Laboriously inscribed manuscripts conferred sacred power to their interpreters, the priests and ministers. As a sixteenth century scribe put it:<blockquote>

'Those who observe the codices,<br>
	those who recite them.<br>
Those who noisily turn the pages of<br>
	illustrated manuscripts.<br>
Those who have possession of the<br>
black and red ink and that which is pictured;<br>
they lead us, they guide us, they tell us the way.'</blockquote>

	State and church ruled in a symbiotic relationship of mutual dependence and tension. State, composed of feudal nobles, was the economic, military and political order; church its cultural arm. The industrial revolution changed all that. One of the first machines stamping out standardized artifacts was the printing press. Its product, the book, was a prerequisite for all the other upheavals to come. Printing begins the industrialization of story-telling, arguably the most profound transformation in the humanization process.<p>

	The book could be given to all who could read, requiring education and creating a new literate class of people. Readers could now interpret the book (at first the Bible) for themselves, breaking the monopoly of priestly interpreters and ushering in the Reformation.<p>

	When the printing press was hooked up to the steam engine the industrialization of story-telling shifted into high gear. Rapid publication and mass transport created a new form of consciousness: modern mass publics. Publics are loose aggregations of people who share some common consciousness of how things work, what things are, and what ought to be done - but never meet face-to-face. That was never before possible.<p>

	Stories could now be sent - often smuggled - across hitherto impenetrable or closely guarded boundaries of time, space and status. The book lifts people from their traditional moorings as the industrial revolution uproots them from their local communities and cultures. They can now get off the land and go to work in far-away ports, factories and continents, and have with them a packet of common consciousness - the book or journal, and later the motion picture (silent at first) - wherever they go.<p>

	Publics, created by such publication, are necessary for the formation of individual and group identities in the new urban environment, as the different classes and regional, religious and ethnic groups try to maintain some sense of distinct integrity and also to live together with some degree of co-operation with other groups.<p>

	Publics are the basic units of self-government. They make it possible to elect or select representatives to an assembly trying to reconcile diverse interests. The maintenance and integrity of multiple publics makes self-government feasible for large, complex, and diverse national communities. People engage in long and costly struggles to be free to create and share stories that fit the reality of competing and often conflicting values and interests. Most of our assumptions about human development and political plurality and choice are rooted in the print era.<p>

	One of the most vital provisions of the of the print era was the creation of the only large-scale folk-institution of industrial society, public education. Public education is the community institution where face-to-face learning and interpreting could, ideally, liberate the individual from both tribal and medieval dependencies and all cultural monopolies.<p>

	The second great transformation, the electronic revolution, ushers in the telecommunications era. Its mainstream, television, is superimposed upon and reorganizes print-based culture. Unlike the industrial revolution, the new upheaval does not uproot people from their homes but transports them in their homes. It re-tribalizes modern society. It challenges and changes the role of both church and education in the new culture.<p>

	For the first time in human history, children are born into homes where mass-produced stories can reach them on the average more than seven hours a day. Most waking hours, and often dreams, are filled with these stories. The stories do not come from their families, schools, churches, neighbourhoods, and often not even from their native countries, or, in fact, from anyone with anything relevant to tell. They come from small group of distant conglomerates with something to sell.<p>

	The cultural environment in which we live becomes the by-product of marketing. The historic nexus of state and church is replaced by the new symbiotic relationship of state and television. The 'state' itself is the twin institution of elected public government and selected private corporate government, ruling in the legal, military and economic domains. Media, its cultural arm, is dominated by the private establishment, despite its use of the public airways.<p>

	Giant industries discharge their messages into the mainstream of common consciousness. Channels proliferate and new technologies pervade home and office while mergers and bottom-line pressures shrink creative alternatives and reduce diversity of content.<p>

	These changes may appear to be broadening local, parochial horizons, but they also mean a homogenization of outlooks and limitation of alternatives. For media professionals, the changes mean fewer opportunities and greater compulsions to present life in saleable packages. Creative artists, scientists, humanists can still explore and enlighten and occasionally even challenge, but, increasingly, their stories must fit marketing strategies and priorities.<p>

	Viewing commercials is 'work' performed by audiences in exchange for 'free' news and entertainment. But, in fact, we pay dearly through a surcharge added to the price of every advertised product that goes to subsidize commercial media, and through allowing advertising expenditures to be a tax-deductible business expense. These give-aways of public moneys for private purposes further erode the diversity of the cultural mainstream.<p>

	Broadcasting is the most concentrated, homogenized, and globalized medium. The top US 100 advertisers pay for two-thirds of all network television. Four networks, allied to giant transnational corporations - our private 'Ministry of Culture'  control the bulk of production and distribution, and shape the cultural mainstream. Other interests, religious or educational, minority views, and the potential of any challenge to dominant perspectives, lose ground with every merger.<p>

	Formula-driven assembly-line produced programmes increasingly dominate the airways. The formulas themselves reflect the structure of power that produces them and function to preserve and enhance that structure of power. Perhaps the leading example of such story functions is violence. It is a good example of how the system works; it is also an indication of the magnitude and nature of the challenge before us.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Violence as a power structure</b></font><br>
Humankind may have had more bloodthirsty eras, but none as filled with images of crime and violence as the present. While violent crime rates remain essentially flat or decline, news of crime surges to new highs.<p>

	US television networks doubled the time given to crime coverage between 1992 and 1993. TV Guide's August 13, 1994 survey also showed a steep increase in stories of violence, especially in local television news.<p>

	Monitoring by the Des Moines (Iowa) Register (March 27, 1994) illustrated how crime and violence skew news priorities. Of the six top stories on Des Moines evening newscasts during February, 1994, one out of four (118 stories) dealt with crime and violence. By comparison, 27 featured business, 17 dealt with government, 15 reported about racial relations, and 2 were stories about the schools.<p>

	A University of Miami study of local television news found that time devoted to crime ranged from 23 to 50 percent (averaging 32 percent) while violent crime in he city remained constant, involving less that one-tenth of one percent of the population.l<p>

	A study by Robert Entman for the Chicago Council on Urban Affairs2 found not only that local news shows are dominated by vivid images of violence, but that 'a high percentage of African Americans and Latinos are shown as victimizers of society, and few as social helpers,' contributing to a sense of fear and distrust (that our own research diagnosed as the 'mean world syndrome')3 and to the notion that 'the inner city is dominated by dangerous and irresponsible minorities.'<p>

	Another study of homicide news reporting4 found that only one of three actual homicides was reported, and that the most likely to be selected were those in which the victims were white rather than black or Latino, contrary to the actual crime statistics. University of Pennsylvania Sociologist Elijah Anderson also noted in the November 1994 issue of Philadelphia Magazine that media portrayals of crime and violence involving blacks and the resulting demonization of black males, becomes a major reason for 'white flight.' In fact, however, African American men, not whites, are the most likely to be the victims of violence.<p>

	Our Cultural Indicators5 study of local news on Philadelphia television found that crime and/or violence items usually lead the newscast and preempt any balanced coverage of the city. Furthermore, 80 percent of crime and violence reported on Philadelphia local news was not even local to the city. It is as if a quota were imposed on the editorial staff to fill from wherever they can. It is also the cheapest way to fill the time. We also found that whites are more likely to be reported when they are the victims and African-Americans are more likely to be reported when they are the perpetrators. Black-on-white crime is less frequent but more newsworthy than any other combination.<p>

	The percent of prime time television dramatic programmes with overt physical violence was 58 in 1974, 73 in 1984, and 75 in 1994. The saturation of violent scenes was 5 per hour in 1974, 5 per hour in 1984, and 5 per hour in 1994 - unchanged. In Saturday morning children's programmes, scenes of violence occur between 20 and 25 per hour. They are sugar-coated with humour, to be sure; that makes the pill of power easier to swallow.<p>

	Violence is, of course, a legitimate and even necessary news and dramatic feature to show the tragic costs of deadly compulsions. However, such tragic sense of violence has been swamped by 'happy violence' produced on the television dramatic assembly-line. 'Happy violence' is cool, swift, and painless, and always leads to a happy ending. Far from Shakespeare or the Bible, it occurs five times per hour, designed to deliver the audience to the next commercial in a receptive mood.<p>

	Action movies cash in on the trend. Robocop's first rampage for law and order killed 32 people. Robocop 2, slaughtered 81. The sick movie Death Wish claimed 9 victims. In the sequel, the 'bleeding heart liberal' turned vigilante disposed of 52. Rambo: First Blood, rambled through Southeast Asia leaving 62 corpses. Rambo III visited Afghanistan killing 106. Godfather I produced 12 corpses, Godfather II put away 18 and Godfather III killed no less than 53. The daredevil cop in the original Die Hard saved the day with a modest 18 dead. Die Hard 2 achieved a phenomenal body count of 264.6<p>

	Violence is a demonstration of power. Its principal lesson is to show quickly and dramatically who can get away with what against whom. That exercise defines majority might and minority risk. It shows one's place in the societal 'pecking order.<p>

	The role of violence in the media mainstream of television emerges from our analysis of prime time network programmes monitored since 1967. Women play one out of three characters in drama, one out of six in the news. Young people comprise one-third and old persons one-fifth of their actual proportions of the population. Most other minorities are even more underrepresented. Most of the groups that are underrepresented are also those who suffer the worst fate.<p>

	The typical viewer of prime time television drama sees, every week, an average of 21 criminals arrayed against an army of 41 public and private law enforcers. Crime and violence engage employ more characters than all other occupations combined. About one out of three speaking parts, and more than half of all major characters, are involved in violence either as victims or as victimizers, or both.
	We calculated the violence 'pecking order' by counting the number of victims for every ten perpetrators of violence. That 'risk ratio' expresses the 'price' groups of characters pay for committing violence. We found that overall average risk ratio (the number of victims per 10 perpetrators) is 12. But the ratio for women is 17, for lower class characters is 19, for elderly characters is 20, and for women of colour is 22. In other words, minority groups tend to pay a higher price for their show of force than do the majorities.<p>

	Our surveys show that heavy viewers express a greater sense of apprehension and vulnerability than do light viewers in the same groups. Heavy viewers are more likely than comparable groups of light viewers to overestimate their chances of involvement in violence; to believe that their neighbourhoods are unsafe; to state that fear of crime is a very serious personal problem; and to assume that crime is rising, regardless of the facts of the case. Heavy viewers are also more likely to buy new locks, watchdogs, and guns 'for protection' (thus becoming the major cause of handgun violence).<p>

	Moreover, viewers who see members of their own group underrepresented but overvictimized develop an even greater sense of apprehension and mistrust. Insecure, angry, mistrustful people may be prone to violence but are even more likely to be dependent on authority and susceptible to deceptively simple, strong, hard-line postures and appeals.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>What drives media violence?</b></font><br>
The usual rationalization that media violence 'gives the public what it wants' is disingenuous. The public rarely gets a fair choice in which all elements but violence, including placement, headline, promotion, airtime, celebrity-value, treatment, etc., are equal. There is no evidence that, cost and other factors being equal, violence per se gives audiences 'what they want.' As the trade paper Broadcasting & Cable editorialized on September 20, 1993 (p. 66), 'the most popular programming is hardly violent as anyone with a passing knowledge of Nielsen ratings will tell you.'<p>

	We compared the ratings of over 100 violent and the same number of non-violent shows aired at the same time on network television. The average Nielsen rating of the violent sample was 11.1; the rating for the non-violent sample was 13.8. The share of viewing households in the violent and non-violent samples, respectively, was 18.9 and 22.5. The non-violent sample was more highly rated than the violent sample for each of the five seasons studied. The amount and consistency of violence further increased the unpopularity gap.<p>

	Concentration of ownership denies access to new entries and to alternative perspectives. Having fewer buyers for their products forces the remaining 'content providers' deeper into deficit financing. As a consequence, most television and movie producers cannot break even on the US domestic market. They are forced into video and foreign sales to make a profit. Therefore, they need a dramatic ingredient that requires no translation, 'speaks action' in any language, and fits any culture. That ingredient is violence.<p>

	Syndicators demand 'action' (the code word for violence) because it 'travels well around the world,' said the producer of Die Hard 2. 'Everyone understands an action movie. If I tell a joke, you may not get it but if a bullet goes through the window, we all know how to hit the floor, no matter the language.'<sup>7</sup><p>

	Our analysis shows that violence dominates US exports. We compared 250 US programmes exported to 10 countries with 111 programmes shown in the US during the same year. Violence was the main theme of 40 percent of home-shown and 49 percent of exported programmes. Crime/action series comprised 17 percent of home-shown and 46 percent of exported programmes. NAFTA and GATT will dump even more mayhem on the world in the name of 'free trade.'<p>

	What can we do? People suffer the media violence inflicted on them with diminishing tolerance. A March 1985 Harris survey showed that 78 percent disapprove of violence they see on television. In a Times-Mirror national poll in 1993, 80 percent said entertainment violence was 'harmful' to society, compared with 64 percent in 1983.<p>

	Local broadcasters, legally responsible for what goes on the air, also oppose the overkill and complain about loss of control. Electronic Media reported on August 2, 1993 that in its own survey of 100 general managers, three out of four said there is too much needless violence on television and 57 percent would like to have 'more input on programme content decisions.' A US News & World Report survey published on April 30, 1994 found that 59 percent of media workers saw entertainment violence as a serious problem.<p>

	Formula-driven media violence is not an expression of freedom, popularity, or crime statistics. It is a de facto censorship that chills originality and extends the dynamics of domination, intimidation, and repression domestically and globally. The media violence overkill is an ingredient in a global marketing formula imposed on media professionals and foisted on the children of the world.<p>

	There is a liberating alternative. It exists in various forms in all democratic countries. It is an independent citizen voice in cultural policy-making. More freedom from inequitable and intimidating marketing formulas, and a greater diversity of sources of support, are the effective and acceptable ways to increase diversity of content. That is also the democratic way to reduce media violence to its valid role and reasonable proportions.<p>


<FONT FACE=futura, arial size=5><b>Changing the media environment</b></font><br>
The Cultural Environment Movement was launched in response to that challenge. Its Founding Convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri, March 15 -17, 1996. It was the most diverse international assembly of leaders and activists in the field of culture and communication that has ever met.<p>

	The 261 participants debated and approved a People's Communication Charter, the Viewer's Declaration of Independence and developed recommendations for action from 15 Task Forces. The concepts that motivated us developed after 30 years of media research. It became clear that research is not enough; we must reclaim the rights gained through centuries of struggle. Working separately on individual issues, rallying to meet each individual crisis, was not sufficient. Treating symptoms instead of starting to prevent the wholesale manufacturing of the conditions that led to those symptoms was self-defeating. The new approach of the CEM involves:<ul>

<li>	Building a new coalition involving media councils world-wide; teachers, students and parents; groups concerned with children, youth and ageing; women's groups; religious and minority organizations; educational, health, environmental, legal, and other professional associations; consumer groups and agencies; associations of creative workers in the media and in the arts and sciences; independent computer network organizers and other organizations and individuals committed to broadening the freedom and diversity of communication.
<li>	Opposing domination and working to abolish existing concentration of ownership and censorship (both of and by media), public or private. It involves extending rights, facilities, and influence to interests and perspectives other than the most powerful and profitable. It means involving in cultural decision-making the less affluent and more vulnerable groups, including the marginalized, neglected, abused, exploited, physically or mentally disabled, young and old, women, minorities, poor people, recent immigrants - all those most in need of a decent role and a voice in a freer cultural environment.
<li>	Seeking out and co-operating with cultural liberation forces of all countries working for the integrity and independence of their own decision-making and against cultural domination and invasion. Learning from countries that have already opened their media to the democratic process. Helping local movements, including in the most dependent and vulnerable countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa (and also in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Republics), to invest in their own cultural development; opposing aggressive foreign ownership and coercive trade policies that make such development more difficult.
<li>	Supporting journalists, artists, writers, actors, directors, and other creative workers struggling for more freedom from having to present life as a commodity designed for a market of consumers. Working with guilds, caucuses, labour and other groups for diversity in employment and in media content. Supporting media and cultural organizations addressing significant but neglected needs, sensibilities, and interests.
<li>	Promoting media literacy, media awareness, critical viewing and reading, and other media education efforts as a fresh approach to the liberal arts and an essential educational objective on every level. Collecting, publicizing and disseminating information, research and evaluation about relevant programs, services, curricula, and teaching materials. Helping to organize educational and parents' groups demanding pre-service and in-service teacher training in media analysis, already required in the schools of Australia, Canada, and Great Britain.
<li>	Placing cultural policy issues on the social-political agenda. Supporting and, if necessary, organizing local and national media councils, study groups, citizen groups, minority and professional groups and other forums of public discussion, policy development, representation, and action. Not waiting for a blueprint but creating and experimenting with ways of community and citizen participation in local, national and international media policy-making. Sharing experiences, lessons, and recommendations and gradually moving toward a realistic democratic agenda.</ul><p>

	The condition of the physical environment may determine how long our species survives. But it is the cultural environment that affects the quality of any survival. We need to begin the long process of diversifying, pacifying, democratizing and humanizing the mainstream story-telling process that shapes the cultural environment in which we live and into which our children are born.<p>

<A NAME="int"><H3>1.1 Introduction</H3></A>



The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) has a mandate which

includes the undertaking of research on issues of relevance to

Ireland's aid programme and the provision of expert advice to the

Minister for Foreign Affairs on matters relating to development

cooperation and policy aspects of the aid programme.

<p>

Having regard for the extent of Irish Aid and NGO involvement in

education projects and the educational challenges currently

facing developing countries, IAAC considered it appropriate to

initiate a fresh examination of the education sector and to study

and reflect on the issues facing Irish Aid to education in the

coming years.  This focus also stemmed from a concern about the

lack of a clear policy on Irish Aid educational assistance to

developing countries, particularly in light of the Department of

Foreign Affairs statement in the Strategy Plan of 1993 that "as

well as identifying individual new projects, longer term

strategic planning is necessary" (p21).

<p>

In order to move towards the emergence of a clear and consistent

policy document on Irish Aid educational assistance, IAAC

initiated a 3 part strategy:

<ol>

<li>A study on Irish Aid and Education was commissioned in

     September 1994;

<li>On publication of the study, a one-day consultative seminar

     was held in March 1995;

<li>A comprehensive report on Irish Aid and Education including

     recommendations to the Minister was formulated by IAAC.

</ol>

<p>

<A NAME="stu"><H3>1.2   Study on Irish Aid and Education</H3></A>

<p>

In September 1994, IAAC commission Ms Cathy Gaynor to undertake

a study on Irish Aid and Education, under the guidance of a sub-

committee.  The study examined the dimensions of a policy and

strategy for Irish Aid support to education in developing

countries.  It provided an overview of current issues in

education in developing countries and of recent Irish

involvement, both official and non-governmental, in the education

sector.  It outlined the findings from a literature review and

from discussions with, and information provided by, Irish

agencies and individuals.  It analyzed recent trends in Irish Aid

to education and made suggestions on possible principles and

strategies for future Irish Aid to education.  It was intended

that the study would facilitate the process of formulation of an

Irish Aid Policy on education and its implementation.

<p>

The study entitled "Irish Aid and Education: Strategic

Challenges.  Setting Priorities for Irish Aid Assistance to 

Education in the Developing World", was published in December

1994.  

<p>



<A NAME="con"><H3>1.3   Consultative Seminar on Irish Aid and Education</H3></A>

<p>

Following the publication of Ms Gaynor's study, IAAC hosted a

one-day Consultative Seminar on Irish Aid and Education on March

27th 1995.  The aim of the Seminar was to provide a forum to hear

the views of the many individuals, NGOs, missionary organisations

and academic institutions involved in education in developing

countries both on issues raised in the study and on other issues

pertaining to education and development policy.  The study was

also circulated to all Development Cooperation Offices for their

observations/comments.

<p>

At the Seminar, Ms Cathy Gaynor outlined the study and its

findings and recommendations.  Four guest speakers then addressed

the Seminar on targeted aspects of the study:

<ul>

<li>The Place of Education in the Irish Aid Programme

     Mr John Grindle, Development Consultant

<li>Priorities for Irish Aid to Education

     Dr Dzingai Mutumbuka, Senior Education Specialist, World

     Bank

<li>Effective Delivery of Irish Aid to Education

     Mr Mike Kiernan, Chief Technical Advisor for Education,

     DANIDA

<li>Structures to Utilize and Strengthen Irish Educational

     Expertise for Development

     Sr Aoife Hynes, Loreto Sisters.

</ul>

<p>

The Seminar then broke into Working Groups where participants

addressed the above issues in detail.

<p>

It was intended that suggestions, recommendations and issues

emanating from the Seminar would be taken on board by IAAC when

formulating their final Report to the Minister.

<p>



<A NAME="rec"><H3>1.4 IAAC Recommendations on Irish Aid and Education</H3></A>

<p>

Having received Ms Cathy Gaynor's comprehensive and challenging

study on Irish Aid and Education and having studied the

recommendations and observations emanating from the Seminar, IAAC

is now in a position to highlight key issues in the area of Irish

Aid to education in developing countries and to outline

principles and priorities for the development of a comprehensive

policy on education in Irish Aid.  IAAC recommendations are

synopsised in this section.  The reader is referred to section

2 of this report for more in-depth discussion and elaboration of

the issues and recommendations.



<p>

<H3>1.5 Summary of Recommendations</H3>





<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 1</H4>

<p>

     - that a permanent structure with expertise in education be

     established in Irish Aid with responsibility for:

          a)  continually evolving and developing Irish Aid

          policy on education;

          b) monitoring criteria for all aid allocation to

          education projects and programmes;

          c) establishing effective procedures for the

          continuous monitoring and evaluation of education

          projects and programmes supported by Irish Aid;

          d) developing structures and strategies to facilitate

          networking and collaboration between all those

          involved in education in the developing world.

<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 2</H4>

<p>

     - that this Report from IAAC, which is based on Ms.Cathy

     Gaynor's study and the ensuing consultative process, be

     adopted as the starting point for the development of a

     comprehensive policy on education in Irish Aid. 

<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 3</H4>

<p>

     - that the current level of Irish Aid support to education

     projects and programmes be maintained.

<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 4:</H4>

 

     - that Irish Aid to education should place major emphasis

     on support for primary and basic education.

<p>



 <H4>RECOMMENDATION 5:</H4>

<p>

     - that support for secondary and tertiary education be

     maintained where necessary and appropriate.

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Jaffna falls to  Sri Lankan army</title> 
<body>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<h2>Jaffna falls to Sri Lankan forces</h2><p>

<b>Wednesday 6 December</b><p>

Government forces in Sri Lanka were celebrating their biggest victory for 12 years yesterday, as they hoisted their national flag over the rebel stronghold of Jaffna.<p>

The victory is mainly psychological however.  Jaffna has been left a ghost town after 400,000 members of its population fled to surrounding areas.  Fewer than 400 civilians are thought to have remained in the town.<p>

The capture of Jaffna comes after a huge offensive by Government troops, and 50 days of bitter fighting which has left 2,500 people dead on both sides.  <p>

This is the first time since 1985 that the entire city of Jaffna has been in Government hands.  Its loss is a double blow to the Tamil Tiger rebels.  The city was the centre of their military operations, and it was also the administrative centre for the rebels' de facto Tamil state.<p>

The conflict in Sri Lanka, which <a href="lanka_background.html">began as long ago as 1958,</a> has been fought with a renewed intensity for the last 12 years.  During this period an estimated 50,000 people have been killed, and thousands more made homeless.<p>

Sri Lankan president Chandrika Kumaratunga began this recent offensive after the failure of peace negotiations.  She was elected in a peace-making manifesto, and has put forward <a href="lanka_peace.html">radical proposals for devolution</a> for Tamil areas.  Her stated aim is to use military pressure to force the rebels back to the negotiating table.<p>

However, the Tamil Tigers, who are fighting for an independent state in the north and east of Sri Lanka, have vowed to fight on.  Their leader, Velupillai Prabakharan, has moved his forces into the dense jungles to the east of Jaffna.<p>

As if to underline their determination to continue the struggle, a Tiger suicide squad drove a truck loaded with explosives into an army camp in the eastern district of Batticaloa (see <a href="map_page.html">map of Sri Lanka</a>).  A police commando was killed, and two more wounded.<p>

Both sides have realised that ultimate victory can only come with the support of the civilian population.  The Tamil Tigers have exercised an iron grip on areas they hold, carrying out public executions of so-called informers to prevent opposition through terror.<p>

But Tamil civilians are still wary of the return of the mainly Sinhalese security forces, who committed ethnically-motivated atrocities in the past.<p>

<center><h2>The roots of the conflict in Sri Lanka</h2></center>
<h3>The Emergency of 1958</h3>

<font size=-1><br> Paradise postponed: Sri Lanka's beautiful beaches give it huge tourist potential<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Photo ©: <a href="http://www.lanka.net/"> Lanka Internet Services</a><br>Reproduced with kind permission</font>
<br clear=left><b>It is often repeated by the Western media that the civil war in <a href="map_page.html">Sri Lanka</a> began 12 years ago.  Yet the conflict has much deeper roots than is commonly assumed.  And as with so many 'ethnic' conflicts, the cause is normally ascribed to either blind hate or animal savagery.  </b><p>


But in 1958 the conflict in Sri Lanka between the Tamils and the Sinhalese began with more mundane issues: jobs, economic prosperity and social change.  Added to political incompetence and manipulation, the scene was set for a collapse of political authority.  <p>


The Tamils and the Sinhalese had fostered distinct identities for centuries.  The Sinhalese come originally from Northern India, and settled in Ceylon 2000 years ago.  The Tamils came from South India more recently, and settled in the north of Ceylon, mainly around the Jaffna Peninsula.  The two kingdoms were at war in ancient times, and fought an epic battle in 164 B.C.<p>


Ceylon, as the island was then called, had missed out on the horrendous killings which accompanied the partition of India.  'It couldn't happen here', was the common feeling among the professional middle classes.<p>


But in 1958 'it' did.  In the fertile and beautiful island, the inter-racial wars of ancient Ceylon were about to re-ignite.  Tarzie Vittachi, a well-known Asian journalist, studied the 'race riots' of that year.  In his book 'Emergency '58' - which for years was banned by the Sri Lankan government - he examines the process of decay:<p>


<ul><li><b>The forces of 'progress'.</b>  By clearing forests for farming in the central parts of the island, the Government brought the two peasant communities together - and begun a bitter struggle for land.<p>


<li><b>Competition for Civil Service jobs.</b>   Since independence in 1948 expansion in the public services and mercantile services had not been fast enough to absorb the growing educated population.  Of course the easiest explanation for the Sinhalese of their inability to find jobs was that the Tamils were packing the services with their own kind.<p></ul>


Vittachi continues: <b>"In an economy which is expanding people have no time, desire nor motive for race-hate, class-hate or religious hate.  It is only when a country's economy is on the down-grade that the inner stresses of society begin to make themselves felt.<p>


Group relationships begin to break up inexorably when the economy is unable to sustain the pressure of population and insecurity haunts the people.  It is also an observable fact that politicians will try to exploit this situation, particularly when they have no foreign political interests of any magnitude with which to distract the people's attention from domestic problems."</b><p>


So it was in 1958.  A stagnant economy and a lack of foreign investment was leading to a growing feeling of insecurity.  Moreover, the 1,000,000 immigrant Tamil labourers from South India - who the British had brought over as cheap labour for the tea plantations - were increasingly viewed as competition for scarce jobs.   The threat of them joining forces with indigenous Tamils worried many Sinhalese politicians.<p>


In the summer of 1958 race hatred broke out surrounding the issue of language.  Tamil and Sinhalese <i>goondas</i> (thugs) battled with tar to obliterate the signs of the other's language.  Within days people - not signs - were being targeted.  Tamil refugees were massacred by mobs, while the Government was powerless - or unwilling - to intervene.  The Bandaraniake-Chelvanayakam pact - agreed between the Prime Minister  and leader of the Federal Party (which was pushing for Tamil autonomy) was abandoned, leading to further violence.<p>


As mob violence increased, fear was deeply embedded into each community.  Rumours of atrocities circulated, and 'communalist' politicians fanned the flames of hatred.  On May 27 1958 a State of Emergency was declared, and the Federal Party was banned.  Strict press censorship was imposed, and civil liberties curbed.  Military control was imposed in Tamil areas.<p>


Within the space of a few months the political breakdown was complete.  Few would have dreamt that by 1995 the issues raised in 1958 would still not have been settled.  It would have seemed inconceivable that war would still be tearing the island apart, and that suicide bombings and killings of civilians would continue for so long.  <p>


<b>In 1958 Tarzie Vittachi, quoting M. A. Jinnah (the founder of Pakistan) asked a simple question: "Have the Sinhalese and the Tamils reached the parting of the ways?"<p>

The question still remains to be answered. </b> <p>

<title>Newsflash 1995 - The Sri Lankan 'peace package'</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p>
<p>
<b><i><font size=-1>From Jehan Perera, Director, Sarvodaya Legal Services and Media Co-ordinator, National Peace Council</font> </i> </b>
<center><h2>Tamil Tigers must be given a role in the peace process</h2></center>

 <font size=-1><br> Sri Lanka at peace: fishing boats on a beach. <br> How likely are the government's plans to lead to a durable settlement?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Photo ©: <a href="http://www.lanka.net/">Lanka Internet Services</a></font><br clear=left>
<hr align=left width=71%>

<font size=+1>The Sri Lankan government's "peace package" has been hailed as a huge step forward.  But, argues <b>Jehan Perera, Media Co-ordinator of the National Peace Council in Sri Lanka,</b> a long-term peace plan cannot succeed unless it brings in the Tamil Tigers.</font><hr align=left width=71%>
<b>The Sri Lankan government's release of its proposals to devolve power to the regions represents its long awaited "peace package" to end a 12-year long civil war.</b><p>


The government's devolution proposals have earned praise internationally and deservedly so.  These proposals to resolve the ethnic conflict seek to redefine the constitutional foundations of a plural society in a time of bitterly divisive civil war.<p>


By granting federalism in all but name they go further than any other set of proposals to resolve the ethnic conflict put forward by mainstream political parties in the country.<p>


On the other hand there has been, in effect, an unholy alliance of Sinhalese nationalists, militant Buddhist monks and the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) who are in opposition to the government's proposals.  <p>


The brutality of the LTTE cart bomb that killed over 20 civilians in Colombo shortly after the release of the proposals, the nit-picking over certain words in the proposals and the alarmist falsehoods being spread about them are a part of Sri Lanka's present ugly reality.<p>


There is a danger that in the next few weeks, as the opponents of the devolution proposals unite to attack them, that the vision that underlies and permeates the government's devolution proposals will be pushed into second place.<p>


Unfortunately the first place, even now, appears to be given to tactical considerations.  Divisions are appearing within the government's own ranks concerning the devolution proposals.  Even those members of the government who are standing by them are explaining the devolution proposals to their constituents as being highly tactical.  The devolution proposals are being justified on the sole ground as being necessary to politically isolate and militarily defeat the LTTE.<p>


Such an explanation of the devolution proposals may be meant to placate Sinhalese opinion in the short term.  But there is a danger coming out of this tactical approach in the longer term.<p>
<hr align=left width=71%>
<b><font size=+1>"A ceasefire would certainly save lives.  There is nothing more valuable than a human life.  But a ceasefire is not absolutely necessary for dialogue..." </b></font>
<hr align=left width=71%><p>

First, the strong anti-LTTE line in it may alienate considerable sections of the Tamil population.  For all their ruthlessness and intransigence the LTTE represents the Tamil national interest in the minds of many Tamils, including Estate Tamil leader Mr Thondaman.  The sooner that the Sinhalese recognise the reality and adjust themselves to it the better.<p>


Second there is little guarantee that even should the government's devolution proposals be accepted by the Tamil people, the LTTE can be militarily defeated or even weakened in the short or medium term.  <p>


The fact is that when the exclusively Sinhala-speaking Sri Lankan armed forces march into Tamil-majority areas they cannot let their guard down.  Any Tamil can be a potential LTTE cadre in the eyes of a soldier who faces sudden death and they are treated accordingly.  In such life-threatening situations even a very fine set of devolution proposals can become irrelevant in determining the loyalties of the Tamil people of those areas.
<p>

The government's political package deserves to succeed but it also has a flaw in it that could prove fatal.  The LTTE has not been brought into the picture.  The devolution proposals, by transferring power to the north-east region and to the other regions, by affirming the equality of the Sinhala and Tamil languages and the commitment of the government to a plural society are meant to address the causes of the ethnic conflict.  But they have not addressed, or been addressed to, the LTTE which controls part of the north-east and which can destabilise the entire country.  Longer term realities strongly suggest that the government needs to start talking again to the LTTE.<p>


The problem is that the LTTE is viewed as a demon by the government and most Sinhalese who believe that the LTTE will never wish to relinquish the near-absolute power they already wield in the north in return for peace and democracy.  The unilateral termination of the four month long cessation of hostilities agreement by the LTTE in April, and the military damage they inflicted on the goverment forces by their surprise attack, came as a stunning blow to the government and the peace lobby.
<p>
<hr align=left width=71%>
<b><font size=+1>"For peace to occur between opponents who hold contrary positions there has to be compromise.  Or else one side has to be destroyed..." </b></font>
<hr align=left width=71%><p>

Even the usually amiable Constitutional Affairs Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris has taken a hard line on the matter of the LTTE's participation in dialoguing on the devolution proposals.  He has said that the government has no intention of sending the devolution proposals to them.  Earlier President Chandrika Kamaratunga said that a ceasefire would be on the government's terms and only if the LTTE agreed to substantially disarm themselves. 
<p>

A ceasefire would certainly save lives.  There is nothing more valuable than a human life.  But a ceasefire is not absolutely necessary for dialogue on the devolution proposals to commence between the government and LTTE and within the north-east also.  To begin with, the LTTE has an obligation to permit the Tamil people to voice their opinion on the devolution proposals.  The voice of the Tamil people in the LTTE-controlled northeast region too must be heard.  By permitting this the LTTE will be showing they are willing to accept the democratic values that are necessary for genuine peace to be born on the island.
<p>

For peace to occur between opponents who hold contrary positions there has to be compromise.  Or else one side has to be destroyed.  The LTTE may reject the devolution proposals or ignore them at this time.  But once the Tamil people begin to feel in their hearts that the government has made them a fair offer, sooner or later the LTTE will have to take notice and be more amenable to compromise. <p>

<title>News - Latest updates of the Sri Lankan conflict</title>

<h1>The conflict in Sri Lanka</h1>

<p>

<b>14 <font size=+1>N</font>OVEMBER 1995</b><p>

Thousands of Sri Lankan government troops are closing in on the rebel Tamil Tiger stronghold of Jaffna.<p>

The offensive has been described as the biggest in 12 years of conflict.  Troops are now reported to be a mere 2 miles from the city centre.  The army is aiming to cut the road from Jaffna and encircle rebels still remaining.<p>

According to the Sri Lankan military, about 60 Tigers have been killed in the last few days.  Over 80 government troops are thought to have been wounded.<p>

Meanwhile the Tamil Tigers demonstrated their continuing capacity to inflict casualties elsewhere, when two suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Army's headquarters in Colombo.  Twelve people were killed.


<p>
<ul><br> <b><li>See OneWorld Online's <br><a href="news_top_asia.html#srilanka">News Features on Sri Lanka</a></b><br clear=left></ul>

<h2>Update from 8 November</h2>

Bloody battles are continuing in the north of Sri Lanka, as government troops inch their way towards the rebel Tamil Tiger stronghold in Jaffna.  The Tigers are fighting for a separate Tamil homeland on the island.<p>

Government forces are now reportedly only 4 miles from the now-deserted city centre.  Between 100,000 (government figures) and 400,000 (aid agency estimate) residents have fled as refugees from the fighting.<p>

More than 1000 soldiers - Tamil Tigers and Sri Lankan military - have been killed.  The number  of civilian casualties is uncertain, but is probably significantly higher.  Both sides have accused the other of human rights atrocities.<p>

Even if the government wins the Jaffna peninsula, it is unlikely to bring the war to a swift end.  The Tigers' guerrilla campaign can continue indefinitely in the jungled terrain.  They have also moved their military command centre into a larger block of Tiger-controlled territory in the east.<p>

Meanwhile the Sri Lankan capital Colombo is bracing itself for further attacks.  Recent attacks on oil installations and suicide bombing campaigns have caused immense damage - both politically and militarily - to the government's offensive against the Tigers.

<h2>Update from 20 October</h2>

Tamil Tiger rebels attacked and blew up two oil depots a mere two miles from the Sri Lankan capital Colombo last night.<p>

At least 20 people were killed and another 25 wounded, military sources and witnesses said.  The dead included army soldiers, air force personnel and Special Task Force police commandos.  <p>

George Arney, Colombo Correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation, was caught in the crossfire and wounded in the face and neck.<p>

The Tamil Tiger attackers may have included members of the so-called 'Black Tiger' suicide bombers.  A Reuters News Agency photographer says she saw the body parts of a suicide bomber.<p>

It is unusual for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to penetrate so close to the centre of power in Sri Lanka in such strong numbers.  The main LTTE force is holed up in the northern Jaffna peninsula, under attack by an estimated 10,000 government troops.

<h2>Update from 5 October</h2>

Nearly 250 people are reported killed in the latest outbreak of bloody warfare in Sri Lanka's Jaffna Peninsula.<p>

Parts of Jaffna were under heavy shelling by government troops on October 4.  The army is said to be beginning a massive offensive against the rebel Tamil Tiger separatists.<p>

A Tamil Tiger-controlled radio station claimed that 50,000 people had been left without shelter in the region due to the intense fighting.<p>

Sources in the Sri Lankan government have pointed out that the monsoon rains are due to arrive in mid-October, after which a large offensive would become impossible.  

<h2>Update from 28 August</h2>

There is no sign of an end to the recent spate of 'disappearances'.  Since May the bodies of more than 20 people, many of whom had been starved and tortured, have been found in lakes and rivers near Colombo.<p>

The killings are reportedly the work of 'rogue' elements within the Sri Lankan army, who are targeting people who they believe are sympathisers of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  The Tigers are fighting for a separate state in the north and east of Sri Lanka.<p>

Meanwhile, the war between the Tamil Tigers and government forces has intensified.  On <b>Tuesday 29th August,</b> 27 soldiers and police were killed in Tamil Tiger attacks.  Missiles were fired at government aircraft, and two naval vessels were also attacked.<p>

The Tamil Tiger offensive follows massive losses in a recent government offensive.  Another large army offensive against the Tiger-held Jaffna Peninsula is expected soon.

<h3>'Radical' devolution package watered down</h3>

President Kamaratunga has begun to water down the radical devolution package, which was aimed at ending the civil war. <p>

Opposition from hardline Sinhalese, who feared that the Government was giving too many concessions to the Tamils, has reduced the chances of success of the 'peace package'.<p>

While the rebel Tamil Tigers have rejected the plan as a "betrayal", they have said they will start talks if the Government halts military actions against them.<p>

The plan allowed for a 'union of the regions', where each of 8 regions would be self-governing, and would hold exclusive rights over land, police forces and foreign investment.  It was also initially planned to deprive central government of the right to dismiss regional governments.  It is this clause that has led to opposition and is likely to be dropped.


<h3>Suicide bombers target Colombo</h3>

<b>The war between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) intensified last week, as a suicide bomb blast rocked the Sri Lankan capital <a href="map_page.html">Colombo.</a></b><p>

The death toll from the bombing has reached 24.  The bomber apparently meant to kill the deputy defence minister.  A second suspected Tamil Tigers bombing in the eastern town of <a href="map_page.html">Batticaloa</a> killed two people and wounded another 12 on Tuesday 8 August.<p>

The renewed spate of bombings followed a major government offensive against the Tamil Tiger-held Jaffna Peninsula.  According to the Tigers, hundreds of Tamil civilians were killed in the fighting.  <p>

The bombings may also have been a response to President Chandrika Kumaratunga's latest peace plan, which the Tigers have rejected.  The reform package, which proposes devolution and a federal system of government, is intended to convince the Tamils that their war for a separate state is unnecessary.<p>

However, the government is trying to exclude the Tigers from any peace process.  There are also signs that human rights abuses against the Tamil minority are again intensifying.  Monitors report that death squads are operating in Colombo, and that bodies have been washed up on beaches around the capital.<p>

The Tamil Tigers' bombing campaign has been grimly successful in the past, and has eliminated many of Sri Lanka's top political and military figures.  President Ranasinghe Premadasa died at their hands, as did two Presidential contenders and several Army and Air Force commanders.  A Tamil suicide bomber also killed the Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.<p>

<a name="int"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<B>
Lom&#233; IV makes repeated and specific reference to the need to
involve consultants from the ACP countries in EDF-financed
projects. In addition, it highlights the opportunity to set up a system
for identifying consultants and training modules and the creation of
joint ventures with European consultancies.</b>
<p>
     Most international financial institutions have regularly
demonstrated the same concerns, linking them to the necessary
development of trade and services. One of the most recent
manifestations of such feelings is contained in the Final Act of the
Uruguay Round which advocates an increase in technology transfers,
access to information and participation on the part of the less-advanced
countries in international transactions.
<p>
     To date, such wishes and directives are far from being fulfilled and
efforts have concentrated on making choices conditioned by the need for
consistency and effectiveness in order to achieve integrated and
sustainable development.
<p>
<a name="nee"><h3>Need for effectiveness and consistency</h3></a>
<p>
     Aid and international cooperation aim to enhance sustainable
growth, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, in the production and
the sale of goods and services in developing countries. In addition to
investment in equipment and major infrastructures, the international
community is involved in all areas of the economy, concentrating
particularly on training, technology transfer and partnerships.
<p>
     However, the vast majority of studies, expert reports and technical-
assistance, monitoring or evaluation tasks associated with this work are
still given to consultants or research organisations from the North. This
situation, the causes of which are discussed below, leads to the
maintenance of sustainable underdevelopment. Indeed, it calls into
question the aims and effectiveness of aid, and poses a threat to its
durability. By ensuring continuing dependence on the outside in a key
economic sector - whose role in growth is nowadays unanimously
acknowledged in the industrialised economies - it undermines the
consistency of policies designed to bring about self-sustaining
development.
<p>
     It is clear that the development of consultancy professions in the
ACPs could make a significant contribution in areas such the retraining of
managers, motivating the private sector (by supporting business
ventures), providing better environmental protection (employing 'home-
bred' professionals) and halting the drift of qualified professionals abroad.
<p>
<a name="rea"><h3>Reasons for failure</h3></a>
<p>
     Most international institutions have studied the obstacles
preventing the use of expertise from developing countries. All seem to
agree that the responsibility must be shared between local consultants
and companies, local governments and external donors (see table). The
reasons for the current weak state of the consultancy profession in the
ACP countries may be summarised as follows:
<ul>
<li>gaps in the exchange of knowledge and information;
<li>lack of qualifications and the weakness, in economic terms, of local
'supply' (where local expertise exists, it is often unsuited to requirements
and cannot be brought speedily and effectively into play);
<li>a generally unfavourable domestic political and economic environment;
<li>the credibility, and financial, technological, human and commercial
strength, of Northern research organisations and consultants.
</ul><p>
<a name="lea"><h3>Leave it to the market?</h3></a>
<p>
     Although the current 'unequal' situation may be justified, if one
looks at it from the standpoint of competition and the free play of market
forces, it certainly appears incompatible with the principles of
development aid and cooperation - which, one should recall, aim to offset
natural, historical or contemporary imbalances by 'artificial' means.
<p>
     Humanitarian considerations aside, it is important to stress that the
continuing provision of financial and technological aid from the North can
only be justified in the context of the sustainable social and economic
development of markets and partners in the South.
<p>
     Within the specific field of consultancy work in the ACP countries,
morality, reason and interest, therefore, combine to favour the
implementation of dynamic development initiatives. A successful
approach to consultancy development, implying as it a does, a more
equitable distribution of the power that resides in know-how, should boost
the credibility of those arguing for continuing aid and development
cooperation.
<p>
<a name="lom"><h3>Lom&#233; IV</h3></a>
<p>
     The following suggestions are derived directly from Lom&#233; IV
(particularly Articles 275, 277, 278, 279, 303, 304 and 321). Their aim is
to contribute in part to the discussions being held on the subject by the
Commission's services, the ACP countries and most of the major donors.
<p>
     One of the initial observations is strategic. In effect, expertise,
technical assistance and consultancy work are currently regarded as
means likely to contribute to the achievement of specific objectives.
These 'tools' thus have to meet the imperatives of effectiveness, speed
and maximum competence. Such criteria are, in general, more readily
met by organisations and consultants from developed countries.
<p>
     Skills originating in the ACP countries tend to be given scant
regard and, in the context of normal competition, they will continue to be
handicapped. If, on the other hand, in a context of active development,
ACP consultancy work is regarded as an end, corrective measures can
be implemented and the imbalance may be offset in the medium term.
Given that only recognised expertise and skills can be used in preparing,
executing and monitoring projects, support measures must necessarily be
designed to identify existing areas of competence and to enhance
training.
<p>
     It is worth pointing out that in the field of consultancy, ACP coun-
tries suffer from a widespread absence of structures for dialogue,
discussion and proposals. There is a need for organisational support at a
national - as well as a regional or international - level, both for existing
federations or associations and in setting up such bodies where none
currently exist. In this context, emphasis should be placed on qualitative
and not just quantitative factors. In other words, membership should be
linked not only to the payment of a subscription fee, but to criteria such
as the existence of a code of conduct, and the availability of the required
skills.
<p>
     Regional and international promotion of a country's own
consultancy skills can be aided by the creation of specialised agencies.
One such example is the ATCT (Tunisian Technical Cooperation
Agency), which nowadays sends some 9000 of its managers out into the
world.
<p>
     Dialogue and exchanges of information between the various
partners can be achieved through specialised meetings. ACP/EU
seminars have been staged on everything from transport and animal
hides and skins, to the promotion of out-of-season produce. In a similar
vein, a conference on consultancy work, expertise and technical
assistance could be organised to great advantage. Such an event,
bringing ACP countries together (perhaps on an annual basis) with the 
European Commission services, other donors and ACP and EU
consultants, would enable professionals to get to know one another
better and demonstrate the opportunities offered by their professions in
the fields of national development and export promotion.
<p>
     Access to information is one of the main consultancy shortfalls in
the ACP countries. Discussions could be initiated between the main
donor and recipient actors in order to make technical and commercial
information more accessible in the ACP countries - using a system which
need not be unduly complicated. This ought to be possible through the
use of modern computer technology, providing access to specialised
databases, as well as through newsletters, manuals and so on.
<p>
     The scarcity of potential private sector customers, and their
financial weakness, is one of the reasons for the general low level of
local consultancy activity in ACP countries. Specific funds, aimed at
making a partial contribution to the costs of a business requiring
consultancy work, could be established to offset this problem.
<p>
     In parallel with these strategic or organisational observations,
operational measures might be envisaged with a view to developing ACP
consultancy bodies, in accordance with the provisions of Lom&#233; IV.
<p>
     One measure that could be implemented almost immediately
would be to provide the ACP countries, donors and consultants from the
North with a reliable list of ACP consultants, experts and companies,
selected on a qualitative and quantitative basis. The drawing-up of such
a document presupposes a precise and acceptable methodology for
ascertaining those who would qualify for inclusion on the list. By way of
example, the criteria for listing a given consultancy in this document
might include the following:
<ul>
<li> the number and level of experience of the experts employed;
<li> the location and size of the premises,
<li> organisational experience;
<li> access to computing and communications equipment;
<li> mastery of foreign languages;
<li> locally available transport infrastructure;
<li> international experience.
</ul>
<p>
     A trial could initially be set up in a group of countries before the
scheme is applied more widely. Those responsible at the national level
for processing the document and for monitoring and updating it would
obviously have a key role to play.
<p>
     In addition to providing more and better information, the promotion
of ACP consultants would be enhanced by greater collaboration and
partnership with professionals from the North. Assuming that there is a
genuine desire to develop consultancy work in ACP countries, such an
improvement must entail a more systematic application of the
promotional possibilities set out in Lom&#233; IV.
<p>
     Without going as far as to lay down specific obligations for
consultancy associations, certain positive measures could be envisaged,
particularly the generalised provision of a 'training' or 'partnership'
section in contract budgets. Such a component would make it possible,
through training programmes, to systematise technology transfer, the
content and objectives of which would depend on the level of qualification
and acknowledged expertise of the associated ACP consultant, who
could be a joint signatory to the final report.
<p>
     There must be few experts, consultants or officials from the North
who have not, at some time, felt a twinge of conscience when carrying
out their mission in ACP countries. Can any of us say that we have not,
at least once, questioned the purpose of our work or of a system (of
which we are part) which does not take account of so much human and
technical potential?
<p>
     Finally, if we really have faith in the success of our cooperation
and development work, when are we going to set up the partnerships
that are needed to open up the new markets in the developing world?

<A NAME=1><hr><B>1. Introduction</B></a>

<P>

The year 2000 will see an end to several important agreements

which guide the European Union's approach to trade and aid with

developing countries including the Lome IV agreement and the Asia

and Latin America agreements (ALA). A crucial debate has begun

on the future of European Union (EU) development co-operation

which will have far-reaching consequences for people living in

poverty and conflict across the globe.

<P>

With net disbursements of $4.8 billion in 1994, the European Community

is the fifth largest donor of funds for development in the world,

and the second largest multilateral donor  after the International

Development Association of the World Bank. The European Community's

development co-operation programme is of great benefit to many

poor people because of its size; its concessional nature, with

grants representing over 98 per cent of its financial assistance;

its integration of trade and aid instruments, and its geographical

spread. However, <I>Eurostep</I> believes that Europe's development

co-operation can be improved enormously by increasing its poverty

focus, ensuring greater coherence with other European policies,

and by improving the mechanisms for its delivery.

<P>

This paper describes the principles which <I>Eurostep</I>, a network

of twenty two European development agencies, wants to see applied

to the task of creating a new framework for development co-operation

for the year 2000 and beyond. Considerable improvements will be

achieved if the best of the Maastricht Treaty and Lome Convention

are combined, if major problems associated with the existing development

framework are addressed and if a reinvigorated vision of Europe's

relations with developing countries is incorporated.

<P>

<A NAME=2></A><B>2. Competing Visions</B>

<P>

There are two competing visions of the future of EU development

co-operation. One believes the efficiency and dynamism of free

markets and foreign investment is the principal guarantor of economic

growth. It is deeply sceptical of development co-operation, which

it sees, at worst, as a motor for dependency and corruption, and

at best as a lever to open up poor economies quickly to the benefits

of the global market. 

<P>

The other vision, which <I>Eurostep</I> shares, sees economic

growth as a part of the means to the end of human development.

In this vision, the next generation of EU development co-operation

must provide international leadership to promote growth with equity

and to use its substantial resources to foster social development

and poverty reduction which markets alone will fail to achieve.

Trade and aid instruments can be effectively directed at poverty

reduction, sustainable development and reducing social tensions

and conflict. This co-operation is an essential tool to counter

rising inequality which is further  polarising an already divided

world. 

<P>

<A NAME=3></A><B>3. Poverty Focus</B>

<P>

Current figures on global poverty makes stark reading. One in

four of the world's population live in a state of absolute want,

and that number is increasing. 70 per cent of the poor are women,

a growing proportion of whom are younger single women who are

heads of households. Global inequality has doubled in the last

thirty years, with the poorest 20 per cent of the world's people

sharing one sixtieth of the wealth enjoyed by the richest 20 per

cent in 1995, compared to one thirtieth in 1965. And 27 million

people are living in poverty as refugees or displaced people after

being forced by war to flee their homes: there numbers have increased

by nearly 60 per cent in the last five years.

<P>

There is growing evidence that global deregulation of markets

and unfettered structural adjustment, in some regions of the world,

have increased inequality and poverty levels. Rapid liberalisation

is destroying rural livelihoods and food security while expanding

urban drift, and exerting downward pressure on labour conditions.

<P>

There is increasing recognition by official aid donors, such as

the European Commission and the World Bank,  that the free market

is incapable of solving many of these problems. This has led to

changes in policy prescriptions to add on safety nets for those

damaged by adjustment, and an emphasis, in their programmes, on

basic social services of health and education, including training

to improve the labour force competitiveness.

<P>

If the European Union's development co-operation is to be effective

after the year 2000, it must go beyond an approach which bolts

on safety nets to a flawed macro-economic framework. Instead it

should aim consistently to encourage more inclusive patterns of

growth  which put the issues of equity, poverty reduction and

conflict prevention at the core of the development process.

<P>

<A NAME=4></A><B>4. Geographical Focus</B>

<P>

<I>Eurostep</I> believes that aid should be aimed primarily at

the needs of the poorest. This will target the poor in the least

developed countries (LDCs) of the world where 40  per cent of

people below the poverty line live, as well as the poor in middle

income countries such as the Philippines and Brazil, where the

majority have been excluded from the benefits of economic growth.



<P>

The current trends in European Community aid appear to be in another

direction. Between 1994 and 1995, aid to Africa, Caribbean and

Pacific (ACP) countries, which include 35 of the 45 LDCs, has

declined from around 50.6 per cent of the total budget to 33.8

per cent. Aid to the Mediterranean countries has increased from

3.6 per cent in 1991 to 10.9 per cent in 1995, while aid to Asia

and Latin America has increased to 18 per cent in 1995.

<P>

The Partnership 2000 process should create a single European framework

for development co-operation which focuses aid and trade measures

on poverty eradication and promoting growth with equity.  This

framework should be based on the objectives of Title 17 of the

Maastricht Treaty: development policy should promote sustainable

development, particularly in the most disadvantaged countries;

the fight against poverty in developing countries; and the smooth

and gradual integration of developing countries into the world

economy; co-ordination of member state's and the Commission's

policy; and coherence of other international EU policy with the

development co-operation objectives. 

<P>

Within this framework there should be a special agreement with

an evolving ACP group. This agreement should consist of an enhanced

package of  development tools including non-reciprocal trade measures

and concessional finance which is ring-fenced for use in poverty

eradication. The ACP group should evolve from its current identity

based on previous colonial ties, to a group of nations characterised

by lower human development indicators combined with a strong national

commitment to reaching clear human development goals.

<P>

Grants should be restricted to low income countries in the group,

with 50 per cent allocated to social development, and to programmes

in middle income countries aimed directly at assisting the poorest

to gain access to education, health and sustainable livelihoods.

<P>

Non-reciprocal trade agreements should be expanded to a broader

group of countries in the evolving group and in sectors where

there is a clear rationale in terms of poverty eradication and

the promotion of equity.

<P>

There are proposals for the next co-operation framework to abandon

the Lome principle of negotiating with a single group of poorer

countries, and instead negotiate packages of co-operation specific

to regions. While there will need to be flexibility in approaches

to different regions and countries, <I>Eurostep</I> believes that

it is vital that the broad agreement is negotiated with a single

group of developing countries. This will ensure a more effective

agreement through partnership, while this group also acts as an

important lobby for the EU to maintain support for some of the

poorest of the world's population. Its early evolution to a group

committed to goals of improved human development will serve to

enhance its influence and authority.

<P>

The European Union currently has an expanding variety of development

co-operation  agreements with developing countries and countries

in transition.  These are managed by four different commissioners

and the President of the Commission. Bringing these together into

a single framework, managed by a single commissioner would achieve

considerable gains in co-ordination, consistency and efficiency.

<P>

<A NAME=5></A><B>5. Aid With Impact</B>

<P>

There is consistent evidence that the people of Europe want a

generous and effective programme of European Community development

co-operation. This public support will only be sustained if the

Community can prove that it is effective in transforming poor

people's lives through securing their human rights to food, security,

health and education, and increasing their opportunity to live

fulfilling lives.

<P>

EU governments struggling to maintain low inflation, cut budget

deficits and meet the criteria for European Monetary Union have

continued to take the easy option of cutting ODA budgets. The

EU average of 0.38 per cent of GNP is shamefully below the UN

recommended level of 0.7 per cent. Despite this, the EU member

states transferred a substantial $31.54 billion in ODA in 1995,

representing over 46 per cent of total OECD DAC. The scale of

these resources provides the EU with a major opportunity to help

alleviate world poverty and address the rising number of conflicts

in the world. 

<P>

To achieve this, <I>Eurostep</I> believes that the member states

and the Commission should work to increase the quantity and quality

of EU aid. Any increase in aid controlled by the European Community

should be contingent upon proof of high quality through investing

in social development; promoting participation of local people

in the design of policies; and ensuring coherence between Community

aid and EU's wider trade and development policies.  These improvements

can only be achieved with adequate human resources within the

Commission to implement the tasks required.

<P>

Essential to improving the quality of aid is the promotion of

aid policy and programmes that promote the equal participation

of women in society. Women provide most of the food consumed by

poor households and perform more than three-quarters of the agricultural

work in many countries. They manage common resources and are responsible

for collecting firewood and water as well as bringing up children.

Women's labour also accounts for a growing proportion of employment

in industry and commercial agriculture. Yet according the UNDP's

Gender Development Index, in no society do women enjoy equal rights

to men. This systematic discrimination has to be tackled at many

levels. However, EU development co-operation can contribute by

ensuring that trade and aid measures seek to redress discrimination,

recognise women's central role in sustainable human development

and promote women's right to equality, including equal access

to land, property, inheritance, and credit.

<P>

European Community development co-operation would benefit greatly

from adopting the goal-oriented approach advocated by OECD in

its paper <I>Towards the 21st Century </I>-<I> </I> defining a

limited number of indicators of success by which its co-operation

efforts can be judged in the future. This will make strategic

decisions focus still further on their positive outcomes for the

poorest. These successes can only be achieved with the participation

of the poor.

<P>

<A NAME=5.1></A><B>5.1 Investing In Social Development</B>

<P>

Investment in health and education is one of the most important

determinants of human development. It is also increasingly recognised

as an important determinant of employment, income, productivity,

and economic competitiveness. Similarly, gainful employment, is

a vital determinant of welfare, income and social cohesion.  

<P>

Although there have been significant improvements in social indicators

in the post war period, basic rights to health, education, food

and employment continue to be denied to millions of people especially

in the world's poorest countries. Today 1.5 billion people have

no access to basic health services. More than 100 million primary

school age children - two thirds of them girls - are not in school.

 More than 800 million people are hungry today. Some 120 million

workers worldwide are unemployed with millions more suffering

from underemployment, many of whom earn below the poverty line.

<P>

Despite the enormous need, only a small fraction of EU ODA is

allocated directly towards basic social services and income generating

schemes, where it can be most effective in poverty eradication.

 This is a missed opportunity. <I>Eurostep</I> believes that donors

like the EU should be allocating at least 50 per cent of its ODA

to social investment. 

<P>

This should focus on:

<UL>

<LI>The basic social services identified in the 20:20 compact

such as basic education and primary health care (including reproductive

health), nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation,

as well as the strengthening of local institutional capacity to

deliver these services.

<LI>Support to income generating activities for the poor in rural

areas and the urban informal sector including small scale credit

facilities, training, technical and marketing assistance; public

investment/employment schemes to generate socially productive

jobs that progressively transfer ownership of assets to the unemployed;

and investment in local agricultural production and food security

systems combined with land reform measures targeted at poor women

and men. 

<LI>Strengthening social and civil organisations, for example

farmers associations, women's organisations, co-operatives, trade

unions, human rights organisations, to help increase their influence

in policy decisions and their ability to access resources and

secure their basic social and economic rights. 

</UL>



<P>

EU aid should give priority in its aid programmes to countries

whose Government's make a mutual commitment to achieving the objectives

in basic social services set out in the 20:20 compact.

<P>

Similarly, the EU should press the International Finance Institutions

(IFIs) to introduce effective social conditionality so that the

disbursement of structural adjustment loans is made conditional

on government action to improve universal access to basic services,

including the withdrawal of user fees.

<P>

Much aid is still not effectively targeted at the poor. The poorest

40 per cent in developing countries receive less than half as

much aid per capita as the richest 40 per cent (UNDP). In large

part this is because elites in poor countries capture the benefits

of aid. This in turn may be related to weak institutional capacity

and skills, and/or overburdening of tasks and conditionalities

imposed by external bodies such as the IMF, WB, WTO, and other

donors. Investment in local institutional capacity is essential

to help poor countries implement effective social and economic

development strategies for the poor.

<P>

<A NAME=5.2></A><B>5.2 Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods and Securing Human Rights</B>

<P>

In parts of Latin America, Africa, Asia and the transition economies,

rapid and unselective market deregulation and liberalisation promoted

under Structural Adjustment Programmes and recent trade and investment

agreements, are undermining livelihoods. Even under conditions

of renewed growth, there is no guarantee that economic reforms

in their current form will be capable of generating adequate new

livelihoods to replace those lost during restructuring. Intensified

global competition, combined with moves to deregulate labour markets,

is exerting downward pressure on labour standards. In Latin America,

for example,  renewed growth between 1990 and 1994 failed to significantly

reduce unemployment, and four out of every five new jobs were

still being generated in the informal sector, where average productivity

and real income decreased. Women, in particular, have suffered

loss of livelihoods on the margins of the economy, while also

receiving the burden created by severe cutbacks in state provision

of basic services.

<P>

The EU should:

<UL>

<LI>Target its aid to improve competitiveness of small and medium-sized

businesses in labour intensive industries, which benefit poor

people by generating employment and incomes while providing goods

and services locally or for export. Foci would include agricultural

export activities, local food security, marketing co-operatives,

new and alternative trading ventures. The latter could include

support to targeted credit schemes, training, marketing information,

technology transfer, research and development, infrastructure.

<LI>Use its influence more effectively in IFIs to reform structural

adjustment programmes (SAPs) to promote growth with equity. This

should include: an expansionary economic environment oriented

towards social and economic recovery, employment creation and

poverty reduction;  selective protection and support to labour-intensive

industries and basic food production; careful analysis of  SAP

impact on women's labour and access to services; state intervention

to manage agricultural markets in the interests of the poor; the

promotion of land reform in favour of poor women and men; targeted

provision of credit, extension services and economic infrastructure

to poor women and men; and the effective protection of labour

standards. 

</UL>



<P>

<A NAME=5.3></A><B>5.3 Debt Reduction</B>

<P>

The debt of sub-Saharan Africa is equivalent to over 100 per cent

of its GNP. The European Commission has declared its commitment

to poverty alleviation, and Horizon 2000 recognises external debt

as a serious constraint on development and poverty reduction.

<P>

The European Commission has two roles to play in debt reduction:

<UL>

<LI>The Commission should play an informal role in coordinating

EU member states at the World Bank and IMF, where together they

constitute a quarter of all votes. This combined financial weight

could direct the debate on debt relief and poverty alleviation,

potentially bringing great economic benefit to poor women and

men.

<LI>While debt owed to the EU and its institutions is relatively

small, it is not insignificant. The Commission should propose

initiatives to cancel debt under previous Lome Conventions.

</UL>



<P>

<A NAME=5.4></A><B>5.4 Conflict Prevention and Resolution</B>

<P>

The world has seen a frightening rise in armed conflict since

1989, and a rapid increase in the proportion of civilian casualties

in these wars. Four out of five casualties in contemporary conflicts

are civilians, and around 80 per cent are women and children.

Humanitarian and development co-operation must have conflict prevention

and resolution as explicit goals. 

<P>

This demands:

<UL>

<LI>An approach to development which is mindful of how co-operation

can ease or foment conflict. An effective anti-poverty policy

can make a long term contribution to preventing conflicts by attacking

their structural causes. All programmes should be assessed according

to criteria which indicate their contribution to promoting equity

while managing the inevitable tensions this process can engender.

<LI>An approach which addresses the structural roots of conflict

and contribute to actors having a greater stake in peace than

in war. The severity of the crisis in a number of countries such

as Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Afghanistan, Angola, Haiti and Sudan

demands a long term commitment which avoids aid dependency but

provides substantial resources to developing the productive capacity

 and opportunities of the poor, while assisting in addressing

profound governance failures.

<LI>A commitment to uphold the basic rights to welfare of civilians

in conflict (see Humanitarian Aid).

<LI>Adequate resources to guarantee the rights to protection from

violence for civilians, particularly women and children. 

<LI>Resources for appropriate social rehabilitation and treatment

of trauma, particularly of women and children who are often the

most psychologically damaged by war.

<LI>Coherence of the Common Foreign and Security Policy with the

EU's development co-operation objectives; complemented by strong

collaboration and exchange of information between diplomatic and

co-operation personnel.

<LI>Support for women's rights, and support for gender sensitive

projects which strengthen the voice of women in civil society.

Women often play a central role in conflict prevention and resolution,

and are recognised as the key actors in creating conditions for

reconstruction and rehabilitation at the local level. This role

must be recognised and strengthened in programmes of European

co-operation.

</UL>



<P>

<A NAME=5.5></A><B>5.5 Humanitarian Aid</B>

<P>

The EU is the world's largest donor of emergency aid, with an

expenditure of 764,169 MECU in 1994. Adequate and effective humanitarian

aid is vital to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of the

victims of conflict and other disasters, and ECHO's actions have

played a key role in achieving this objective.

<P>

Three principles should be applied to humanitarian aid to strengthen

its role in protecting the basic rights of its recipients.

<P>

It must:

<UL>

<LI>Be <I>coherent</I> with other strategies to promote 'structural

stability' and peace-building. 

<LI>Be <I>proportionate</I> to the threat which emergencies pose

to the rights of their victims.

<LI>Meet <I>standards</I> of effectiveness in protecting those

rights.

</UL>



<P>

In December 1995, Commissioner Bonino agreed the Madrid Declaration

which stated: &quot;Determination is required to take whatever

resolute and decisive action may be necessary to resolve crisis

situations -<I> and not to use humanitarian aid as a substitute

for political action</I>&quot;. To guarantee <I>coherence</I>

between these two requires the EU to agree a mandate for the Common

Foreign and Security Policy which includes conflict prevention

and resolution and the upholding of humanitarian and human rights

law.

<P>

Humanitarian aid must be <I>proportionate</I> as commitment to

international humanitarian and human rights law entails the principle

that every person has the equal right to humanitarian aid, wherever

she or he lives on the globe. Currently ECHO's distribution is

unjustifiably skewed towards central and eastern Europe and the

former Soviet Union which are allocated 45 per cent of the total

in the 1996 budget.

<P>

Humanitarian aid must demonstrate its cost-effectivenes<I>s</I>

and high quality. To do this, we urge the European Community and

member states to join with NGOs in developing <I>standards</I>

in emergency aid, to demonstrate excellence in ensuring that the

relevant rights - including those to water, food, shelter and

health contained in the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural

Rights and other human rights instruments - are upheld for people

suffering in emergencies. 

<P>

EC emergency aid must address the specific needs of women and

children and their participation in programme management. A <I>gender-sensitive</I>

analysis must be integrated into the guidelines on assessment,

planning, monitoring and evaluation for EC emergency aid.

<P>

<A NAME=5.6></A><B>5.6 The Administration of Aid</B>

<P>

Despite recent improvements in planning, policies and co-ordination,

<I>Eurostep</I> shares the widespread misgivings about the effectiveness

of EC aid. Its procedures are cumbersome and bureaucratic, the

pace of disbursement is slow, it is highly centralised, and is

ill-adapted to a more transparent and participatory approach to

development.  In addition, the current level and capacity of human

resources within the Commission to handle that the broad geographical

coverage and the spectrum of development instruments within the

European Community programme is inadequate.

<P>

On gender policy, a number of reports note a significant gap between

the general rhetoric on the importance of women in the development

process and the practical applications. Similarly, while more

funds are being earmarked for the environment, many development

projects have failed to take into account environmental issues,

and the Commission is frequently unable to carry out environmental

impact assessments on its own projects.

<P>

The EC also has a poor record on accountability: member states,

MEPs and NGOs have all encountered difficulties in eliciting adequate

information from the Commission on project performance and the

sectoral breakdown of aid. When monitoring and evaluations have

revealed deficiencies in the process of project identification,

design and implementation - whereby social and economic effects

of investments have not been adequately taken into account - there

is no practical means of redress available. These issues and recommendations

on participation, accountability and transparency are dealt with

further in sections 6 and 7.

<P>

<A NAME=6></A><B>6. Trade And Investment</B>

<P>

For most developing countries, international trade and investment

are far more decisive in determining their opportunities for equitable

human development than aid flows. Europe's approach to trade and

investment is therefore critical to its development co-operation

goals.

<P>

European Union trade and investment policy is at a watershed.

Shifts in the international trade environment are eroding traditional

EU preferences for poor countries; the EU and US are increasingly

intolerant of poor countries which seek to protect industries,

even while they subsidise and protect their own industries. The

EU, with the USA, played the central role in the design of the

last GATT agreement, which is now widely perceived as detrimental,

on balance, to the poorest in least developed countries, and damaging

to long term food security. The EU appears determined to use emerging

 regional and cross-regional trade agreements as tools to prise

open still further markets in developing countries with little

or no regard for poverty eradication, basic rights or environmental

goals.

<P>

The EU needs a re-shaped and coherent trade and development assistance

policy for poor countries and poor people which is aimed at poverty

reduction, strengthening the natural resource base on which many

poor women and men depend, and promoting basic rights and food

security.

<P>

The EU has developed a variety of trade agreements with different

regions. The most significant in development terms has been the

Lome Convention. The latest assessments of the trade instruments

of the Lome Convention indicate that some countries, such as Fiji

and Mauritius, have benefited significantly from access and preferences.

However, the Convention's development tools have not been able

to overcome structural barriers to the development of trade in

many ACP states, and have failed to diversify ACP exports. 

<P>

The final years of the Lome IV agreement coincide with concern

in Europe about high structural unemployment and a declining economic

and trade performance of member states relative to North America

and East Asia. This anxiety is provoking member states to look

to short term, national self-interest in trade policy, just at

a time when a long term and more global vision is required. The

current negotiations for a free trade agreement with South Africa,

with EU member states pouring in lists of products which must

be excluded on the grounds of national interest, is an illustration

of how protectionism is an immediate response of EU member states

to almost imperceptible effects on their interests, while the

EU is increasingly intolerant of efforts to protect industry by

poor countries.

<P>

<I>Eurostep</I> believes the following principles should underpin

the development of future trade and investment policy of the European

Union with least developed countries:

<P>

<A NAME=6.1></A><B>6.1 An Integrated Trade and Development Policy</B>

<P>

The EU must integrate its trade policy and development assistance

strategy, in dialogue with southern governments. Special emphasis

should be placed on assisting least developed countries and those

reconstructing after severe conflict. Strategies need to be developed

to make the benefits of trade policy reach the poor and reduce

inequality of income and access to resources. 

<P>

<I>Eurostep</I> proposes a negotiation to draw up a new trade

agreement with LDCs as well as with ACP countries which would:

<UL>

<LI>Establish explicit development objectives including the promotion

of growth with equity, poverty reduction, food security, workers'

rights and environmental improvement, including the natural resource

base on which many of the poor depend for their livelihoods.

<LI>Affirm the poverty eradication goal of the trade agreement

by providing the preferences given to ACP countries to other LDC

countries currently excluded from preferential trade.

<LI>A new approach to trade preferences, particularly ones that

are non-reciprocal, which allow them to be targeted effectively

at products which are particularly helpful to poor producers and

sectors where minimum standards of worker's rights are guaranteed.

</UL>



<P>

Currently, preferences and access for poor countries for many

products are not targeted at sectors which would assist the poor.

In some circumstances, preferences currently generate huge profits

for commercial farms and international marketing corporations.

EU development assistance, including trade, should be better targeted

to enhance the market opportunities of small and medium-sized

businesses, more marginal producers as well as larger companies

which adhere to minimum environmental and labour standards. Trade

policy should be designed to promote productive capacity, and

productive employment in labour-intensive industries, which international

markets cannot be relied upon to create.

<P>

<A NAME=6.2></A><B>6.2 Regional Trade Agreements</B>

<P>

The EU is putting considerable emphasis on promoting and strengthening

regional and inter-regional trade agreements. The benefits of

regional integration, however, depend upon the goals which are

set for it. The European Union could play a central role in promoting

integration which brings considerable economic benefits for the

poor, and promotes stability and security between neighbouring

countries and peoples. 

<P>

However, at this time, regional and inter-regional integration

is being used predominantly as a means of pursuing  rapid and

indiscriminate liberalisation of trade and investment, the promotion

of free and unhindered movement of goods, services and capital.

<P>

While this has potential benefits for many developing countries

if well managed, in terms of increased market access and trading

opportunities, it also has dangers, particularly for the livelihoods

of poorer and weaker sections of society. Without planned assistance,

the poor do not have the capital or technical advice to take advantage

of new opportunities by moving into the more sophisticated and

capital intensive export sector. EU promotion of regional and

inter-regional trade agreements should ensure they are designed

to maximise trading opportunities for developing countries while

not undermining the livelihoods of vulnerable groups or endangering

the environment.

<P>

European Union assistance should promote fair and equitable trade

within regions. This approach requires EU co-operation to promote

models of integration which address structural inequalities in

a region. An equitable approach would include structural funds,

possibly created by debt relief or financial support, and EU technical

assistance for social and environmental chapters to regional trade

agreements, which would prevent social dumping and promote a clean

and sustainable environment.

<P>

These regional agreements should also receive strong technical

assistance from the European Union to support the establishment

of regional competition policies and business regulation. Competition

policy is vital to guard against the emergence of monopolies,

particularly foreign companies who may very easily swamp infant

indigenous companies in an environment of liberalisation and deregulation.

Regional business regulation has the potential of neighbouring

governments agreeing on what is socially and culturally acceptable

from foreign and domestic companies, in terms of the treatment

of workers, communities, the environment and the fiscal returns

to the nation and region from their commercial activities.

<P>

<A NAME=6.3></A><B>6.3 Social and Environmental Goals in Trade</B>

<P>

Under the right conditions, trade liberalisation can have a positive

impact on labour and environmental conditions through a more efficient

allocation of resources and increases in productivity, leading

to social development and higher wages. None of these impacts

are automatic. 

<P>

<I>Eurostep </I>believes that trade agreements must include environmental

and social considerations if they are to be effective in poverty

eradication and development. Trade agreements with the EU should

include a set of minimum standards which establish a floor of

acceptable practice in the export sector regarding the basic rights

of communities, workers and protection of the natural resources

on which the poor depend. Given the sensitivities of these development

tools, the agreement on the content and application of these standards

must apply to all EU inter-regional trade agreements and be negotiated

with the evolving ACP group as well as parties to other area trade

agreements. The complaints and enforcement mechanisms should be

designed to reflect the partnership nature of the accord, and

to guarantee objectivity. 

<P>

Their contents should be based on already existing international

agreements such as the core International Labour Organisation

(ILO) conventions (freedom of association, right to collective

bargaining, right to equal remuneration for men and women, freedom

from discrimination, and the abolition of forced labour) and global

environmental treaties to which most states are already signatories.



<P>

Standards should be applied universally, however given the proliferation

of regional trade agreements, the proposed minimum standards have

the advantage of furthering basic rights while not eroding the

comparative advantage of many developing countries: their cheap

labour. 

<P>

Developing countries would need commitment from the EU to provide

economic and technical assistance in reaching standards. This

could be achieved through technology transfer, debt relief, and

funding.

<P>

<A NAME=6.4></A><B>6.4 Multilateral Agreements on Investment</B>

<P>

Dissatisfied with the Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs)

agreement of the Uruguay Round, the OECD members are developing

a Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) which essentially

prevents national governments from imposing trade-related restrictions

on investments. Strongly promoted by the EU, the MAI would 'guarantee

generally free entry and establishment for foreign investors,

full national treatment for established investments and high standards

of investment protection'.

<P>

Foreign investment can be of great benefit within an appropriate

policy context. It is particularly critical for the governments

of developing countries to continue to have the right to regulate

the terms and conditions for the entry and operation of foreign

investment in various sectors of the national economy. Control

of foreign investment is vital to nurture domestic capacity and

allow local enterprises to become more competitive. The EU should

provide technical assistance to developing countries to strengthen

their capacity to negotiate investment agreements which promote

emerging industries, guarantee minimum labour and environmental

standards, while encouraging foreign investment in a fashion which

promotes sustainable development and global competitiveness.

<P>

<A NAME=6.5></A><B>6.5 A New EU and LDC Agreement and the WTO</B>

<P>

The European Union, along with the rest of the world, must face

up to a rising number of global problems which require international

solutions. World trade agreements are one area where the EU must

combine its own legitimate right to pursue its self-interest with

its international obligation to seek a stable and equitable global

economy which has the support and confidence of all nations. 

<P>

If the European Union and LDCs build an integrated trade and development

policy for the next era, they should seek to lead global debates

on international trade and investment. The World Trade Organisation

(WTO) is an organisation with one country one vote, where together

the EU and LDCs would form a substantial bloc if they acted together.

The potential to improve the Uruguay Round agreement by introducing

social and environmental goals and standards is considerable.

The WTO will discuss social and environmental clauses at its meeting

in December 1996, and the agreements on Trade Related Investment

Agreements and Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights are

to be reviewed in the next two years. The European Union, as the

largest trading bloc, acting in concert with least developed countries

in international fora could play a decisive role in the creation

of global institutions for regulating international markets to

improve human welfare, and create conditions for stability, jobs

creation and sustainable economic growth. The potential of this

approach for real impact on poverty and conflict would be enormous.

<P>

<A NAME=7></A><B>7. The Importance of Partnership</B>

<P>

Partnership is a fundamental principle of the relations between

Europe and the ACP states within the Lome Convention. Under Lome,

partnership means equality between partners, respect for sovereignty,

solidarity, mutual interest, and interdependence; as well as the

respect for the right of a state to determine its own political,

social and economic policies. An inequitable balance of power

between the European Community as donor and the ACP states as

recipients inevitably compromises this principle. However the

benefits of ownership of the development process, predictability

of the relation, and dialogue are crucial to the quality of co-operation

and should continue to underpin economic and political relations

under a future framework for development co-operation.

<P>

<A NAME=7.1></A><B>7.1 Accountability, Political Dialogue and Respect for Human

Rights</B>

<P>

The European Union can play an important role in promoting respect

for human rights in its external relations. The values underpinning

the EU's own ethos include the promotion of peace and the settlement

of conflict, the consolidation of democracy, and the observance

of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 

<P>

The once politically neutral Lome Convention now provides for

political dialogue between the EU and ACP partners, as well as

human rights conditionality on aid. While social and human rights

conditionality is a contentious issue, if it is designed sparingly

and with the participation of all relevant parties (governments,

social organisations, NGOs) within a mature partnership, it does

allow the expression of the fundamental values which both donors

and poor people in LDCs and middle income countries see as essential

to sustainable development.

<P>

There is widespread scepticism about the motives of official donors,

with their diverse foreign policy objectives, in invoking concern

for human rights and poverty reduction to pressure for internal

reform in recipient countries. The EU itself has been particularly

inconsistent in suspending aid or trade on human rights grounds

for reasons of economic or political self-interest.

<P>

This failing must be addressed through:

<UL>

<LI>Conditionality based on universal human rights enshrined in

international law, and defining relations not just between governments

but with NGOs, the private sector and social organisations.

<LI>The design of transparent criteria and objective mechanisms

within the partnership agreement to ensure consistent and fair

application of conditionality in all co-operation agreements.

</UL>



<P>

Accountability of all parties is crucial to a mature and effective

partnership. The Lome IV Convention provides a mechanism to prevent

non-compliance with agreements on respect for human rights, the

rule of law, and the promotion of democratic principles. It states

that if one party fails to fulfil an obligation in respect of

these agreements,  consultations will take place with representatives

from ACP, member states and the Commission with a view to assessing

the situation in detail, and if necessary, remedying it. However,

this mechanism does not effectively extend to cases where lack

of due diligence by the European Community cause the rights of

people to be violated, through badly planned development programmes.

Currently no effective mechanisms exist for presenting complaints

and for obtaining redress. It is essential that provision is made

for a complaints procedure.

<P>

 

Many governments in poor countries make genuine attempts to promote

respect for human rights and consolidate the rule of law and democratic

principles, but may not have the capacity to comply with all that

this entails. Developing an effective, fair and independent judicial

system, or an effective civilian police force, accountable to

public scrutiny are essential to building respect for human rights

but are difficult and complex tasks. Conditions should not be

imposed that the donors themselves do not respect, and care should

be taken not to block funds because of a failure to meet conditions

that could only be satisfied by using the funds withheld.

<P>

For EU development co-operation to become accountable, it must

establish a monitoring system, based on impact and efficiency

for each project and programme at the design stage.

<P>

<A NAME=7.2></A><B>7.2 Participation </B>

<P>

<I>Eurostep</I> believes that the quality of participation is

a critical determinant of the quality of development co-operation.

Under the current framework of EU development co-operation, the

objectives and design of EU-funded national development strategies

are created, almost exclusively, by officials of the recipient

government and the EU. Little provision is made to consult with

the beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of programmes or

with organisations already working in a particular sector. 

<P>

The European Union has provided significant funds for development

and humanitarian programmes of NGOs in the North and South, but

co-operation with governments has often excluded organisations

which could be crucial to a strategy's success: women's organisations,

trade unions, farmers' and business organisations, decentralised

public authorities, NGOs, and beneficiaries of particular projects.

NGOs and similar organisations must not be encouraged to substitute

for the state's role in basic service provision, but decentralised

co-operation policy is recognition of the importance of a wide

variety of actors in the development process. Unfortunately these

same actors are not appropriately included in the design of national

strategies.

<P>

The next generation of EU development co-operation must include

effective mechanisms for broader participation in design, implementation

and evaluation. To foster greater participation, accountability

and transparency, reforms should be established that promote a

greater role for organisations of civil society. NGOs have considerable

expertise, particularly in social development, and are often representative

of broad and diverse constituencies whose participation is essential

to success.

<P>

A precondition to effective participation is access to information.

Currently it is often extremely difficult to get information on

strategies and programmes. Local communities, NGOs and wider civil

society have usually been kept in the dark about development priorities,

financing agreements and contracts. Future development co-operation

agreements should include an information disclosure policy that

is based upon a presumption in favour of disclosure - national

development strategies for particular countries, indicative programmes,

and financing agreements. Going further than the limited but positive

changes at the World Bank, these EU documents should all be in

the public domain to improve transparency, efficiency and accountability.



<P>

<A NAME=8></A><B>8. Coherence of  EU Policy</B>

<P>

All European Community and EU member-state policies that have

an impact on developing countries should seek to complement one

another and promote development. Article 130v of the Maastricht

Treaty states '<I>The Community shall take account of the objectives

referred to in article 130u in the policies that it implements

which are likely to affect developing countries.'</I> To date

there has been little effort to establish effective mechanisms

for achieving coherence through implementation, monitoring and

evaluation. The incoherence of the objectives of policies that

impact on developing countries is the central weakness undermining

the EU's efforts to achieve its central objectives relating to

its campaign against poverty, consolidating democracy, the rule

of law and respect for human rights, and promoting the social

and economic sustainable development in developing countries.



<P>

There are a range of EU specific policies where mechanisms for

demonstrating and monitoring coherence need to be designed:

<P>

Common Foreign and Security Policy: the revised mandate should

make explicit commitments to conflict prevention, uphold humanitarian

and human rights law, and be coherent with development co-operation

objectives and humanitarian action.

<P>

Trade and Investment: EU trade and investment policy should aim

to promote social development and sustainable livelihoods. A development

co-operation framework which succeeds Lome IV must include trade

concessions for ACP and LDC countries, and uphold minimum labour

and environmental standards. The EU could also use its substantial

negotiating power at the WTO to revise the Uruguay Round agreement

to promote human welfare as well as economic growth (see section

5).

<P>

One of the greatest areas of damaging incoherence is the EU Common

Agricultural Policy (CAP). The EU has financially supported efforts

to achieve improved food security in developing countries. Yet

the CAP, through direct payments to farmers and food dumping artificially

reducing the world market price, has systematically undermined

food producers, particularly the poor and mainly women. These

producers of staple food stuffs have seen their comparative advantage

unfairly eroded, and their markets and livelihoods destabilised.

The distortions in the CAP, which consumes over half the European

Community Budget, currently serve the interests of large farm

enterprises, the agro-chemical industry and grain traders. For

new development co-operation agreements to be most effective,

major reform of the CAP is required. The CAP should promote sustainable

farming systems which will end structural over-production and

the need for export dumping.

<P>

Furthermore, the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is in direct

conflict with the aims of development co-operation to promote

locally based artisanal fishing industries in which the majority

employed are women and who play a crucial role in satisfying nutrition

requirements in coastal developing countries. The main priority

of the EU in negotiating fisheries agreements is to secure access

for EU vessels to the exclusive economic zone of coastal states

where 95 per cent of fish stocks are found (LC report). Future

fisheries agreements between the EU and developing countries must

in no way undermine the development of the local artisanal fisheries

sector.

<P>

The Maastricht Treaty development co-operation policy also sets

a further objective, and makes provision for European Community

and EU member-state co-ordination and complementarity of their

respective development . There are considerable efficiency savings

to be made here which would increase the impact of EU co-operation.

Decreasing aid levels make the efficient use of resources for

development assistance more important than ever. One critical

area in which EU member-states could do more to co-ordinate their

policies with those of the European Commission's, is that of commitments

made at UN Conferences such as the programmes of action of the

World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth World Conference

on Women. 

<P>

<A NAME=9></A><B>9. Conclusion</B>

<P>

European Union relations with countries in poverty and conflict

are at a crossroads. Global inequality is increasing and more

than half the people on the planet have income of less than $2

a day - more than 3 billion people. Governments of the Union are

under pressure to seek short term gains in balance of payments

and competitiveness through cutting aid budgets and prioritising

commercial relations. At a time when vision and international

leadership is required, the Union often appears to be inwardly

focused and unsure of its role in the world. 

<P>

The negotiation of the next generation of EU development co-operation

presents a rare opportunity for member states to commit themselves

to promote international economic justice and human rights. <I>Eurostep</I>

intends to work with organisations in the South and North to make

sure our voices influence the negotiations in favour of a new

and courageous framework for European co-operation with peoples

in poverty and conflict.

<hr>

<P>

A crucial debate has begun on the future of European Union (EU)

development co-operation which will culminate in a new generation

of international agreements in the year 2000. The conclusions

to this debate will have far-reaching consequences for people

living in poverty and conflict across the globe.

<P>

This paper sets out the principles which <I>Eurostep</I> believes

should act as the foundations of the debate. They derive from

a vision that the EU must provide international leadership in

promoting growth with equity for human development. Trade, aid

and investment instruments available to the EU must be directed

at poverty reduction, sustainable development and reducing conflict

which markets alone will not achieve. 

<P>

<A NAME=es1></A><B>1. Geographical Focus</B>

<P>

The nature of the next generation of co-operation for development

should be defined within a single framework agreement setting

out its principles, aims and concrete objectives defined by a

limited number of social and economic indicators of success in

terms of transforming poor peoples' lives.

<P>

Within this framework there should be a special agreement with

an evolving ACP group which rapidly changes its nature to a group

of nations with lower human development indicators combined with

a proven commitment to reaching clear development goals. These

will be achieved through strategies which include collaboration

with the EU in development co-operation and action in concert

at multilateral fora in the negotiation of global agreements on

trade, investment and structural adjustment.

<P>

Within this evolving ACP group,  grants should be restricted to

low income countries and programmes in middle income countries

aimed directly at assisting the poorest in education, health,

and sustainable livelihoods. Non-reciprocal trade agreements should

be expanded to a broader set of low income countries with special

emphasis given to trade in sectors where there is strong potential

for poverty reduction and the promotion of equity.

<P>

<A NAME=es2></A><B>2. Aid With Impact - Investing in Social Development</B>

<P>

Given the real cuts in ODA across Europe in the last five years,

member states and the European Community should seek to reverse

this trend in total EU aid. Any increase in aid controlled by

the Community should be contingent on proof of high quality through

investing in social development; promoting participation; insisting

on coherence of wider trade and investment policies with development

co-operation objectives; concrete human development targets; and

improved impact assessment.

<P>

There is an urgent need for rebalancing the geographic distribution

of EU aid and trade agreements in favour of LDCs if it is to remain

coherent with the EU's expressed development goals in Chapter

17 of the Maastricht Treaty.

<P>

Public support for EU development co-operation rests on the belief

that it reduces poverty, increases human security, and is sustainable.

For this support to be sustained, <I>Eurostep</I> believes the

next generation of EU aid must invest at least 50 per cent of

funds in social development as agreed at the World Summit on Social

Development. This will include:

<UL>

<LI>The basic social services identified in the 20:20 compact:

basic education, primary health care, nutrition, safe drinking

water and sanitation.

<LI>Support to income generating projects for poor people in rural

areas and the urban informal sector. This should aim to improve

the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses in labour

intensive industries through credit, training, marketing information,

technology transfer, infrastructure.

<LI>A commitment to implement the gender policy of the European

Community and direct development co-operation to promote the equal

participation of women in society and women's right to equality,

including in land, property, and credit.

<LI>Strengthening social organisations (farmers, women, trade

unions, human rights) to increase their influence and promote

growth with equity.

</UL>



<P>

<A NAME=es3></A><B>3. Debt Reduction</B>

<P>

The Commission should use its development tools to support debt

relief to the evolving ACP group. It should also informally co-ordinate

EU member states at the World Bank and IMF to guarantee coherence

with the EU's stated goals of poverty eradication and gradual

integration of developing countries into the global economy.

<P>

<A NAME=es4></A><B>4. Conflict Prevention and Resolution</B>

<P>

Human security must be central to future EU development co-operation.

This will demand:

<UL>

<LI>A future approach to development which is mindful of how co-operation

can ease or foment conflict. All programmes should be assessed

according to criteria which indicate their contribution to promoting

equity while managing the inevitable tensions of social change.

<LI>An approach which addresses the structural roots of conflict

and contribute to actors having a greater stake in peace than

war.

<LI>Adequate resources to guarantee the right to protection from

violence of civilians, particularly women and children.

<LI>Support to women's role in reducing social tension, and their

often central role in prevention, reconstruction and rehabilitation.

<LI>Coherence of the Common Foreign and Security Policy with the

EU's development co-operation objectives.

<LI>Humanitarian aid must be rebalanced to make its distribution

between regions of conflict proportionate to the threat which

emergencies pose to the rights of victims. Currently 45 per cent

of the budget is skewed to central and eastern Europe and the

former Soviet Union. 

<LI>Humanitarian aid should demonstrate cost-effectiveness and

high quality. The latter would be reinforced by joining with NGOs

in developing standards in the provision of water, food, shelter,

and health.

</UL>



<P>

<A NAME=es5></A><B>5. Trade and Investment</B>

<P>

To be effective in promoting human development, the EU must integrate

its trade policy and development assistance strategy, in dialogue

with southern governments. Eurostep proposes a negotiation to

draw up a new trade agreement with the evolving ACP group which

would:

<UL>

<LI>Establish explicit development objectives, including the promotion

of growth with equity, poverty reduction, food security, worker's

rights and environmental improvement. These social and environmental

goals in trade should be assisted through technology transfer,

debt relief and concessional finance.

<LI>Extend the preferences currently given to ACP countries to

other developing countries with low human development indicators

and strong commitment to improvement.

<LI>A new approach to trade preferences, particularly those which

are non-reciprocal, which will allow them to be targeted effectively

at products which are particularly helpful to poor producers and

sectors where minimum standards of worker's rights are guaranteed.

</UL>





<P>

<A NAME=es5.1></A><B>5.1 Regional Trade Agreements</B>

<P>

At this time, regional and inter-regional trade agreements are

being uses to pursue rapid and indiscriminate liberalisation of

trade and investment. To ensure potential benefits promote growth

with equity, the EU should seek agreements designed to maximise

the opportunities of the poor majorities in developing countries

while not undermining their livelihoods and food security.

<P>

Regional agreements should also receive strong technical assistance

from the EU to support the establishment of regional competition

policies and business regulation, to guard against unfair competition

which stymies indigenous companies and domestic investment.

<P>

<A NAME=es5.2></A><B>5.2 A New EU and LDC Agreement and the WTO</B>

<P>

If the EU and LDCs build an integrated trade and development policy

for the next era they should seek to lead global debates on international

trade and investment. Acting in concert at the WTO for common

goals, these two groups would form a substantial bloc in an organisation

of one country one vote. The coming debates on social and environmental

clauses, and reviews of TRIMs and TRIPs provide an opportunity

for collaboration with enormous influence and mutual long term

benefits.

<P>

<A NAME=es6></A><B>6. Partnership and Participation</B>

<P>

Partnership, as a fundamental principle of the Lome agreements,

has shown itself to be a powerful development tool involving equality

between partners, respect for sovereignty, solidarity and mutual

interdependence. <I>Eurostep</I> believes these principles must

be preserved in future framework agreements. While this paper

proposes social conditionality on aid, we believe this is not

in contradiction with partnership if the following conditions

are  met:

<UL>

<LI>Conditionality based on universal human rights enshrined in

international law.

<LI>The design of transparent criteria and objective mechanisms,

universally applied.

</UL>



<P>

The concept of partnership must also be extended to foster greater

participation of social organisations, including NGOs in the design,

implementation and evaluation of policies and programmes.

<P>

<A NAME=es7></A><B>7. Harmonising EU Policy</B>

<P>

One of the principle indicators of the EU's commitment to human

development will be whether coherence is established between its

development co-operation objectives and its trade, agricultural,

fisheries, and common foreign and security policies. The paper

makes particular recommendations for each of these areas.

<P>

<P>

<I>Eurostep</I> has produced this paper as a contribution to the

debates that are now taking place on the future shape and form

of the European Union development co-operation agreements.  The

perspectives set out in the paper are drawn from the experiences

gain in development of <I>Eurostep's</I> member organisations

through their involvement in development programmes in Africa,

Asia and Latin America.  The paper was prepared by the Oxfam-UKI

Policy Department in consultation with other member organisations

of <I>Eurostep</I>.<HR>

<h3>WINDS OF CHANGE</h3>
<p>
<i>Can the United Nations change enough to win renewed credibility
and respect? Or will it be blown away? <b>Chris Brazier</b>
investigates.</i>
<hr>
<p>
High up in the UN building in New York you get a fine view of
Manhattan's skyscrapers one way and a rather less spectacular
outlook over the East River into Brooklyn the other. But the
offices themselves are really rather ordinary - bland decor,
standardized office equipment, ubiquitous computers - not much
sign of the lavish bureaucratic excess attacked by conservative
critics. The sense of being in a special place does not come
here on the upper floors or even in the General Assembly hall
which sits idle for eight months of the year. It is in the staff
canteen at lunchtime. Here you see at every table a convincing
cross-section of the world's people, endlessly diverse in colour
and language - a downhome testament to the working reality of
the United Nations.
<p>
As I sat there listening to the panoply of different accents it
threw me back to my teens. While I was still at school and idly
considering what my glorious future career might be, the
pinnacle of my aspirations was a job with the UN. I suspect I
was not alone in those ambitions. Back in the 1960s and 1970s
the UN commanded respect and faith as an embodiment of
international concern. Whatever its problems during the Cold
War, there was always the idea that the world's well-being was
being looked after by an institution that would one day, when we
were all adult enough to accept that nationalism was a thing of
the past, become a world government.
<p>

<p>
I doubt that many teenagers would share these aspirations now.
Public disillusion with the UN is growing as fast as cynicism
about Western politicians. Why? After all, we're now five years
into the post-Cold War period when the UN gained a new freedom
of action, liberated from the tiresome game of superpower veto
pingpong. 
<p>
In a way what went wrong was that the Cold War ended at all. As
long as that continued, its ice covered the cracks in the
institution erected by a war-weary world on 26 June 1945.<b>(1)</b> As
long as Washington and Moscow eyeballed it out over the Security
Council table we could dream - if only the UN was liberated from
this straitjacket! And we could concentrate on the positive
achievements - the eradication of smallpox by the World Health
Organization or the immunization of children worldwide by
UNICEF. 
<p>
But then the Soviet bloc imploded. Our hopes soared for both a
peace dividend and a UN with a new lease of life. The <b>NI</b>'s last
issue on <i>The Arms Trade</i> detailed how the peace dividend has been
wasted. And much of this issue shows how inadequately the UN has
used its new freedom of manoeuvre over the last five years.
<p>
The Gulf War was the start. This was represented as a great
triumph - a despot's invasion of a defenceless little country
was rolled back by the sheer collective will of the
international community. But the military campaign was so
transparently a US action -  mainly US soldiers, commanded by US
generals, using state-of-the-art US hardware - that it severely
damaged the credibility of the United Nations as an independent
force. Smaller states were whipped into line. Egypt went along
meekly and had its debts to the US cancelled; Yemen stood out
against and lost its US aid.
<p>
But at least the UN operation in the Gulf was successful in its
own terms - it evacuated the invading forces from Kuwait and
blitzed Iraq back into 'a pre-industrial age'.<b>(2)</b> The UN's
performance as an international peacekeeper since then has been
shockingly inept, as this issue's articles on Somalia and Rwanda
make clear. 
<p>
Are we expecting too much? Whenever a crisis crops up now in the
world our first instinct is to call for the UN. Yet we find
fault with whatever action they take. The same people who
advocated armed intervention to defend the Bosnian Muslims will
deplore the intervention in Somalia. The same people who opposed
all-out war on Saddam Hussein will call for all-out war on the
Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
<p>
<b>Blaming the parent</b><br>
In a way we want to blame the parent. Parents are routinely
blamed for all the problems of their children - 'They fuck you
up, your Mum and Dad' is probably the poet Philip Larkin's most
quoted line. Doubtless because I am a parent it seems rather too
easy a let-out. The UN may suffer from the same syndrome. When
trouble flares up we can satisfy our desperation that something
should be done by calling for the UN to deal with it. And when
things inevitably go wrong we can pour scorn on it - for not
intervening quickly or early enough, or for riding roughshod
over local political and cultural conditions. 
<p>
Even so, the UN's independence is severely compromised by its
subservience to Washington DC. What is the major factor which
determines whether or with what vigour the UN launches a
peacekeeping operation? The principle? The appalling nature of
the problem? Neither. It is the mood of the US. If the White
House decides for its own reasons  to wade into Somalia -
because President Bush wants to give a humanitarian gloss term
of office - then that is what the UN will do. If the US decides
it doesn't want to get involved in Bosnia - 'we have no
strategic interest in the Balkans', said the State Department's
Lawrence Eagleburger - then the UN ends up wringing its hands
over 'ethnic cleansing'. If Washington is in isolationist mood
licking its wounds after the fiasco in Somalia then some of the
worst massacres in recent history can be more or less ignored in
Rwanda. 
<p>
Unfortunately US influence over the world body is harder and
harder for the South to challenge. 
<p>


<p>
<i>"The decisions of the Security Council
 are binding on member states; those of 
the General Assembly are not. 
The five main victors in World War Two 
have permanent membership of the 
Security Council and an individual veto 
over its decisions."</i>
<p>
Back in the late 1960s and 1970s the UN was seen as a forum in
which the newly independent developing nations might win
meaningful changes in the world order. They could not compete in
global trade, in wealth or in military firepower. Yet here at
least they could be heard. There was genuine hope that through
the UN the South could successfully challenge the existing world
order. 
<p>
Those days are long gone. It is shocking to realize now how much
those hopes depended on the support of the Soviet Union. For all
its faults, Moscow was prepared to champion the cause of the
Third World - not least because it was scoring points off
Washington and Western capitalism. The Soviet bloc's collapse
left developing countries bereft. The non-aligned movement, once
a focus for creative ideas if not for global muscle, is now more
or less non-existent. In a bipolar world there was the space
between to be non-aligned; in today's unipolar world everyone is
sucked towards the magnetic centre of power. Countries that once
demanded things as their moral right now go cap in hand to the
global financiers.
<p>
<b>Everyone is cutting a deal</b><br>
One insightful UN employee from the South lamented this trend.
It was a sad picture he painted for me, in which China's defence
of its own independent view of human rights (send in the tanks
and lock up the students) was welcomed by Southern governments
of all political colours simply because it showed a developing
country standing up to the West for a change. 
<p>
'For the most part,' he said, 'there is no real notion of a
Third World with a collective agenda any more - everyone is
simply trying to cut a deal with the US and the West... I am
committed to the UN,' he continued, 'without it there would be
chaos out there. But what I want from it is not what the major
powers want. They don't want the UN to address social and
economic development. All they want is a UN that keeps the lid
on - and they only really want that in regions where they have a
direct strategic interest.' 
<p>
This Western lack of interest in the UN's promotion of
development is increasingly evident. Michel Camdessus, who heads
the IMF, went so far as to say in 1992 that the UN was just one
of the four pillars of the world system. He relegated it to
social affairs while the other three pillars - his own
organization, the World Bank and the new World Trade
Organization (the successor to GATT) - handled the serious
economic business. The idiocy of seeing social affairs as
separable from economic forces apparently did not strike him.
Neither did the arrogance of setting his own unaccountable
fiefdom on a par with the United Nations.
<p>
Yet you can almost understand his arrogance when you see with
what compliance the UN has tossed its responsibility for
economic affairs into his lap. So now when the UN wants to talk
about issues like the widening gap between rich and poor in the
run-up to the vital World Summit on Social Development in
Copenhagen in March, the US and its key allies will say that any
debate about economic issues 'will be best handled by the
appropriate institutions' - meaning the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
Ah, 'the appropriate institutions' - what a weasel term. The
idea of the UN becoming a global government now seems absurd.
Yet in one way it has already come about as the IMF and the
World Bank have ranged the world cowing national governments
into submission. Both these institutions are part of the UN
system, though they have become a law unto themselves - not
least in their own pay and perks, which far exceed those of
their UN counterparts.
<p>
But theirs is the efficiency of the tunnel-visioned accountant,
aware of the bottom line but not caring about the hardship their
'adjustment' programmes cause. Still less are they capable of
standing back far enough to see that their policies - a decade
now in the testing - have failed even on their own terms.
<p>
In the light of all this should we tear down the UN? The
traditional defence against this has been the worthwhile work
done by the diverse <a href="NIUNagencies.html">UN agencies. </a>Some of their achievements,
notably in health, have been spectacular. But the development
work is no longer sufficient defence since as many agencies are
performing badly as are doing well. And three decades of
'development' have done nothing to combat the core problem of
global inequality. In 1960 the richest fifth of the world's
population earned 30 times the income of the poorest fifth;
today it earns 60 times more.<b>(3)</b>
<p>
Yet ironically the worst aspect of the UN's record provides the
main reason for trying to retain and reform it. If it were
abolished tomorrow it is probable that the best agencies, like
UNICEF, could retain an independent existence. But it is
absolutely certain that the World Bank and the IMF would gain
even more unchallenged sway. And if the UN were to be demolished
there would be not a hope in hell of a new organization rising
phoenix-like from the ashes to challenge them. The will and
idealism to create a new institution has only ever existed after
a major cataclysm - as the First World War spawned the League of
Nations and the Second World War the UN. And while we may lament
the fact that the UN's rhetoric too seldom translates into
action, even the limited prick to conscience that rhetoric and
peer-group pressure provide may be preferable to no
acknowledgement of responsibility for the poor at all.
<p>
<b>Crying out for reform</b><br>
It is, then, worth at least trying to reform the UN. The natural
first impulse is to make it more democratically accountable.
Despite the opening to the Charter which reads 'We the peoples
of the United Nations...' (significantly echoing the
constitution of the United States), the peoples are notable by
their absence. Yet this would not be easy to correct. 
<p>
We could demand that delegates to the General Assembly were
elected. But the whole point of the UN is that governments
should implement the policies collectively arrived at there -
and taking the General Assembly out of their hands would make
this much less likely. The more urgent need is to reform the
existing institution so that it functions with more efficiency
and independence. Since the US is forever screaming about how
much money it has to pay into the UN system (even though it has
to be cajoled and crawled to for the dues to be paid, usually a
year or 18 months in arrears), its contribution should be
reduced from 25 per cent of the regular budget to nearer 10 per
cent. Other wealthy countries should share the burden more
evenly. This would automatically slacken the American
stranglehold somewhat.
<p>
<b><i>WHO SHOULD PAY THE BILLS...</i></b><br>

<p>
<b><i>...AND WHO FAILS TO PAY</i></b><br>

<p>
The <b>NI</b>'s game <a href="NIreform.html">'Navigating UN Reform'</a> suggests how difficult it
will be to reform the archaic power structure of the Security
Council. <link to "New Internationalist UN Reform Game">  The
pre-eminence there of the post-war victors - the US, Britain,
France, Russia and China - with their veto over changes in the
UN Charter as well as everyday policies, is an absurdity. They
are unlikely to give up their privileged position - particularly
the ex-colonial powers of Britain and France who cling on to
their places at the top table like children desperate to stay up
late with the grown-ups. But by clinging on by their fingertips
they are putting the whole existence of the UN in danger. A new
Security Council which had as many permanent members from the
South as from the North - and ideally with no-one holding a veto
- would do much to transform the world's sense of the UN.
<p>
<b>Choosing a leader</b><br>
At the very least the UN must be transparently accountable. The
permanent members also control the appointment of the
Secretary-General and their method of selection is about as open
and systematic as King Henry VIII's appointment of advisers. Did
the current incumbent, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, formally apply for
the job? Was he interviewed? Was an exhaustive trawl done of 
the most able candidates? No. Boutros-Ghali was appointed the
same way all his predecessors were, after a secret process of
horse-trading between the veto-holding powers to find the least
offensive candidate. It is hardly a system designed to provide
the world with an energetic, visionary leader. That is no
coincidence since the major powers decided nearly 25 years ago
that they much preferred someone who would not rock the boat.
<p>
The appointment of the Secretary-General - and of all the
directors of UN agencies, whose recruitment is just as much of a
lottery - must be taken out of the hands of the major powers.
The General Assembly should instead launch an accountable
recruitment process. Perhaps if this were so the Assembly would
be sensible enough to choose a first female Secretary-General. 
<p>
Sadako Ogata, the current High Commissioner for Refugees, has
been tipped as a possibility - she has already regenerated one
moribund agency, after all. What is more she is prepared to
tread on toes to support what is right. She is making
Boutros-Ghali squeal at the moment, publicizing a report from
Rwanda which claims there are organized killings of Hutus by the
new government's army; he wants the report suppressed because it
makes the UN's peacekeeping forces in the country look bad. 
<p>
The first test of whether the UN can regenerate itself as a
force for global change will come soon. At the vital Social
Summit in March the UN must recognize that its vision of human
development is being fatally undermined by the policies of its
own institutions. The fiftieth anniversary year would be a
suitable moment to create an Economic Security Council - and to
begin the process of bringing the IMF and the World Bank to heel.
<p>
The UN edifice cannot be insulated from the winds of change for
much longer. If it is not prepared to take on a new role, more
representative of the needs of that vast majority of the world's
population which lives in the South, then it must prepare to be
blown away in a cloud of dust and dreams.

<h2>New Internationalist On UN Agencies</h2>

<h2> School's Out</h2>
<p>
<i>Few people know just how many UN agencies there are - still less
whether their work is effective. Here the NI marks the report
cards of the most prominent members of the UN class.</i>
<p>
<h2>FAO</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>REPORT 1945-1994<p> 
Full name: UN Food and Agriculture Organization<br> 
Home Address: Rome<br> 
Principal: Jacques Diouf (Senegal), Director since 1994<br>  
Class Size: 6,000 employees<br>
Allowance: $673 million (1994/5) 
<p>
Record: FAO's 50th birthday falls a few days before that of the
UN as a whole, next October. The shadow of one man will loom
large over the celebrations - Edouard Saouma, whose 18 years as
Director recently came to an end. Saouma ruled with the iron
fist of a medieval emperor - staff were required to call him
'Your Excellency'. FAO has a worse record than any other agency.
It has actually done more harm than good to people and the
environment through its uncritical promotion of the Green
Revolution, dangerous pesticides and its insistence that small
farmers switch to cash crops instead of growing their own food.
Saouma's departure must help but FAO seems almost beyond reform.

<h2>UNICEF</h2><br>
<ul><li>REPORT 1946-1994<p>
Full name: UN Children's Fund<br> 
Home Address: New York<br> 
Principal: James Grant (US), Director since 1980 <br> 
Class Size: 7,000 employees 
<p>
Allowance: Income $888 million, Expenditure $972 million (1994).
UNICEF is the only UN agency which receives funds direct from
the general public. 
<p>
Record: UNICEF has been the driving force behind the universal
child immunization programme, which it claims is now saving the
lives of 10,000 children a day. Its World Summit for Children in
1990 produced a treaty which should soon become the first
universally ratified human-rights convention in history - and
its country offices are energetically monitoring governments'
progress in meeting the goals they've signed up for. UNICEF is
the most focussed of all the UN agencies - and the most
effective. But even its strength as an institution could be
endangered by the wrong choice as Director following Jim Grant's
imminent retirement (he is now 72).

<h2>UNFPA</h2><br>  
<ul><li>REPORT 1969-1994<p> 
Full name: UN Fund for Population Activities<br>  
Home Address: New York<br>  
Principal: Nafis Sadik (Pakistan), Director since 1987<br>   
Class Size: 837 employees<br>  
Allowance: Income $219.6 million Expenditure $215.4 million
(1993) 
<p>
Record: More and more women are gaining control of their
fertility. While less than 10 per cent of couples in developing
countries used contraception in the 1960s, 55 per cent did in
1993. But UNFPA is funded and driven by rich countries' paranoia
about population growth in the South - it has looked too kindly
over the years on repressive regimes like China (with its
one-child policy) and Indonesia. It has also had (on its own
admission) 'an overwhelming concern for quantitative
achievements and... demographic targets' - in other words
keeping Third World numbers down. In recent years, though,
partly because of its female Director, UNFPA has placed much
more emphasis on women's rights, seeing them as people needing
education, equality and comprehensive health care rather than
just as mothers. The recent Cairo Conference may have had to
steer a course between the Vatican and Western feminism but its
emphasis on women's choice and reproductive health and choice is
a big improvement on simplistic Malthusian number-crunching.

<h2>UNDP</h2><br>  
<ul><li>REPORT 1965-1994<p> 
Full name: UN Development Programme<br>  
Home Address: New York<br>  
Principal: James Gustave Speth  (US), Administrator since 1993<br> 
Class Size: 6,631 employees Allowance: $1,426 million (1993)  
<p>
Record: Even people in the development field tend to be hazy as
to what UNDP actually does - and some say you could abolish it
tomorrow and barely notice the difference. This is because it is
a funding and co-ordinating agency with no projects of its own.
Its image has been transformed by the success of the Human
Development Report. Outspoken for a UN document about the need
to change development policies so they meet the needs of the
poor, the Report is the more remarkable for having emerged
during the term of Bill Draper, a Reaganite whose main passion
was for privatization. UNDP's funding policies have barely
changed, however - and its criticism of structural adjustment
seems hypocritical given its close co-operation with the World
Bank. New Administrator Gus Speth claims to be bringing UNDP's
funding criteria into line with the human-development principles
of the Report - but then he would, wouldn't he? UNDP needs to
put its money where its mouth is.

<h2>UNHCR</h2><br>  
<ul><li>REPORT 1951-1994<p>
Full name: UN High Commissioner for Refugees <br> 
Home Address: Geneva<br>  
Principal: Sadako Ogata (Japan), High Commissioner since 1991.<br>
Class Size: 3,444 employees <br>
Allowance: Hoped-for expenditure in 1994 $1,308 million. Raised
by 31 August $889.6 million. UNHCR depends on voluntary
contributions from governments, which vary each year.
<p>
Record: In contrast to WHO, UNHCR has been revitalized by a
change at the top. The previous High Commissioners, Messrs Hocke
and Stoltenberg, had respectively been ousted due to a financial
scandal and resigned after a few months. UNHCR itself was
ineffectual and unfocussed. The new chief, Ms Ogata, has
transformed the organization. It now responds more quickly and
efficiently to refugee crises - which are now coming thicker and
faster than ever - and responds to the needs of internally
displaced people as well as those who have left their country.
She has also raised the agency's profile substantially - not
just through public relations but also through taking up vital
refugee-related issues.<p>  Mark: 7/10

<h2>WHO</h2><br> 
<ul><li>REPORT 1948-1994<p>
Full name: World Health Organization<br>  
Home Address: Geneva<br>  
Principal: Hiroshi Nakajima (Japan), Director since 1988<br>  
Class Size: 5,200 employees<br>   
Allowance: $1,800 million (1994/5)  
<p>
Record: WHO can take credit for one of the UN's greatest
achievements - the eradication of smallpox. But it is a classic
case of a UN agency which has gone off the rails because of a
change of regime. Under its previous Director, Halfdan Mahler,
WHO was an effective advocate of primary health care (investing
in low-tech care at local level instead of hi-tech hospitals and
medicine for an elite). It also campaigned for countries to use
a few essential drugs rather than a plethora of expensive brand
names - and the agency still contains able people doing good
work to fight disease. But Mahler's successor, Nakajima, has
more or less ditched the essential drugs policy, influenced by
the lobbying of the pharmaceutical industry. He is generally
considered to be a disaster and even the major powers were not
prepared to support his re-election in 1993. But in a dismal
display of vote-buying by Nakajima and his Japanese Government
backers that brought the whole UN system into disrepute, he
eventually gained re-election.

<h2>UNEP</h2><br>  
<ul><li>REPORT 1972-1994<br>  
Full name: UN Environment Programme<br>  
Home Address: Nairobi<br>  
Principal: Elizabeth Dowdeswell (Canada), Director since 1992. <br>  
Class Size: 913 employees Allowance: $112.1 million (1993)<br>  
<p>
Record: UNEP has been one of the weakest agencies in the UN
system - the surge in environmental concern worldwide cannot be
attributed to its work. Previous Director Mostafa Tolba was
notorious for his autocratic, almost monarchical behaviour and
it is significant that the two major recent international
initiatives on the environment - the Brundtland Commission and
the Rio Earth Summit - were organized outside UNEP. Its most
concrete achievement has been to secure an agreement that has
reduced the pollution of the Mediterranean. New Director
Elizabeth Dowdeswell is a technocrat who has failed as yet to
raise morale or effectiveness.

<h2>ILO</h2><br>     
<ul><li>REPORT 1919-1994<br> 
Full name: International Labour Organization<br>  
Home Address: Geneva<br>  
Principal: Michel Hansenne (Belgium), Director-General since
1989.<br>  
Class Size: 1,254 employees <br> 
Allowance: $447 million (1994/5) 
<p>
Record:  75 years old this year, ILO is often seen as the agency
promoting the interests of workers worldwide. But given that it
is responsible to a tripartite board comprising governments,
employers' organizations and trade unions, it is never likely to
do that. The last time ILO was at the centre of things was in
the late 1970s when its World Employment Programme, emerging
from a major conference in 1976, threw up all kinds of creative
ideas about the basic needs of the poor. Since then it has been
marginalized by the dominance of the World Bank and IMF in
economic matters and ILO has become an inconsequential backwater
of the UN system.

<p>
<B>As we approach the end of the millennium, higher education world-wide
finds itself in a paradoxical situation. On the one hand, it is
witnessing unprecedented growth. Enrolments are on the increase
and so are the expectations placed on it by society. The correlation
between investment in higher education and research, and the level
of social, economic and cultural development of nations is well-established
and is gaining increasing ground at a time when all development
has become knowledge-intensive. On the other hand, higher education
is in a state of crisis in practically all countries of the world,
under the pressure of serious financial constraints. It has to
compete for public funds with many other sectors and very often
it is among the first to undergo severe cuts. These cuts have
reached a dramatic threshold in the developing countries. As a
result, the gap between the developing and the developed countries
with regard to higher learning and research is wider than ever
and it continues to grow.</b>
<P>
Inter-university cooperation has emerged
as a major tool for the support of higher education in the developing
countries and as a flexible mechanism for the rapid transfer and
sharing of knowledge, channelled via university links and exchanges.
As emphasised in the Policy Paper for Change and Development in
Higher Education issued by UNESCO in 1995, 'the most pressing
need for international cooperation in higher education is to reverse
the process of decline of institutions in the developing countries,
particularly in the least developed.' The internationalisation
of higher education has advanced steadily, reinforced by current
processes of economic and political integration and facilitated
by the steady advances in information and communication technologies.
But, as indicated in the UNESCO World Education Report (1993),
it is increasingly subject to the competitive laws of the market.
Universities have been urged to develop an entrepreneurial, commercial
attitude and to regard international cooperation mainly as a source
of additional income. Fees for foreign students have risen considerably
in many countries. As a result, academic mobility is becoming
more North-North and less South-North or South-South. The benefits
of study abroad, of exchanges, networking and access to data are
recognised, but the costs involved render them increasingly a
privilege, restricted to those who can afford it.

<H3>An innovative programme</H3>

UNESCO's response to these trends was the UNITWIN/UNESCO
Chairs Programme, launched in 1991. While serving as an instrument
to foster overall inter-university cooperation, it was aimed at
giving a clear direction and goal, namely to support higher education
in the developing countries. It was meant to mark a return to
the spirit of international academic solidarity, through twinning,
networking and other linking arrangements among universities.
The programme was also designed as an innovative form for the
rapid transfer of knowledge, and for institutional development
in higher education, including the establishment of transnational
centres for advanced studies and research, as a means of redressing
the widening knowledge gap between industrially developed and
developing countries. One other aim of the Programme was to alleviate
the negative effects of the brain drain.
<P>
The UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Programme has seen steady and dynamic development from the very
beginning, and has emerged as the major thrust of UNESCO's action
in the field of higher education. The favoured institutional framework
for carrying out activities is a UNESCO Chair. The programme's
activities are extremely diverse. They include the appointment
of visiting professors, provision of scholarships and fellowships,
facilitating of staff and student exchanges and undertaking of
joint research. The 'chairs' are typical of basic units of research
and training, with a strong international dimension, since either
the chairholder, or some of the professors or researchers associated
with its programme come from abroad. Other projects involve complex
inter-university networks, varying in size from three to more
than 50 institutions. Within networks, certain institutions serve
as focal points, responsible for initiating activities and securing
broad participation in their execution. Also included are cooperation
programmes established by UNESCO with major university associations
and networks in order to carry out UNITWIN-related activities.
<P>
At present, there are 163 established UNESCO Chairs (a further
84 are under consideration) and 34 large-scale networks (18 more
are being developed). A total of over 750 teachers, researchers
and other support staff are involved in their activities. It is
estimated that 350 courses (mainly at the graduate level), attended
by more than 7500 students, were organised by the established
UNESCO Chairs during the 1992-1996 period. Also, 120 seminars,
training workshops, symposia and colloquia were staged over the
same period, attended by more than 6000 participants. Some 580
academics from developing countries spent short periods of time
at partner universities in the developed countries to upgrade
their training. In addition, 355 scholarships have been granted
to students and young academics from developing nations within
the framework of the Programme. Research has been encouraged through
240 projects (mainly joint ones) resulting, according to progress
reports received so far, in the publication of 55 volumes, some
100 published articles and over 150 monographs and progress reports.

<H3>The ACPs in the programme</H3>

A large number of these projects (UNESCO
Chairs and networks) concern ACP countries. Africa has been given
top priority. Over 30 of the established Chairs are located there
and 18 more are under consideration for sub-Saharan Africa, in
order to reinforce the contribution of the programme to the development
of higher education in this region. In addition, certain projects
located at institutions in Europe and North America carry on activities
which are designed to support African universities. A few examples
illustrate this. Starting from its bilateral links with several
African universities, the University of Utrecht proposed developing
these into a broader, multilateral project under the umbrella
of UNITWIN. For this purpose, it joined forces with three other
European institutions: the University of Lund in Sweden, the Ruhr
University in Bochum, Germany and the University of Porto in Portugal.
The result was the establishment of the Utrecht/Southern Africa/UNITWIN
(USU) network. It includes, at its southern pole, the universities
of Harare, Maputo, Namibia, and Western Cape, where UNESCO Chairs
have been established in different fields. The aim is to develop
each of them into (sub)regional centres of advanced study and
research. This is well under way in the case of the UNESCO Chair
in Mathematics and Science Education at Western Cape University
in South Africa. A first step was to link its activities to those
of the MESA (Mathematics Education in South Africa) project, a
cooperation project between the Utrecht-Freundenthal Institute
for Mathematics Education and the University of the Western Cape.
A school for Science and Maths Education is to be established
at the University of Western Cape.
<P>
Another large scale project is the Network of African Teacher Training Institutions, built
around a UNESCO Chair at the Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in
Dakar. This is designed to serve as a regional centre for postgraduate
training and research in the field of education. After several
years preparation, activities were launched in 1995. The strength
of networking is illustrated by a number of other linking arrangements
in support of African higher education institutions. These include
the network initiated by the NATURA Group of European universities
in the field of agriculture, the ORBICOM Network in the field
of Communication, which is a global network but pays particular
attention to the needs of African universities, and the UNESCO/Johns
Hopkins University Networking and Partnership in Adolescent Youth
Health and Development. The last-mentioned focuses on HIV/AIDS-related
research, and includes institutions such as Addis Ababa and Makerere
Universities.
<P>
The agreement signed by UNESCO with the Association
of African Universities (AAU) within the framework of UNITWIN
provides for support of the latter`s staff development and management
programme. A UNESCO Chair in Educational Management and Administration
is to be established. It will function on a rotating basis at
several universities in South Africa, Botswana and Malawi.  There
are also a number of  'tailor-made' chairs which respond to more
specific needs of institutions, notably to develop training and
research capabilities in areas such as human rights, democracy
and peace (at the Universities of Namibia, Addis Ababa and Fianarantsoa
in Madagascar), or in the field of Water Resources and Water Culture
(at the Universities of Malawi and Omdurman in Sudan).  In the
latter field, an interesting example is the UNESCO Chair established
at the University of Nice, which, although located in France,
carries out its activities in Mauritania and has produced the
most comprehensive study so far on water resource management in
that country.
<P>
The programme has also made a good start in the
Pacific and the Caribbean, even if achievements there are on a
more modest scale. There are already 22 established chairs with
14 more under consideration. They cover a wide spectrum of priority
fields, including the sustainable use of rain forest resources
at the University of Guyana, higher education management and information
technology at the University of Havana in Cuba, educational sciences
in Fiji, and the use of drugs in Chulalongkorn University in Thailand.
<P>
UNESCO works closely with the University of the South Pacific
and the University of the West Indies, with which it has established
4 UNESCO Chairs. Moreover, it has signed a cooperation agreement,
in the framework of UNITWIN, with the Commonwealth Secretariat
and the Association of Commonwealth Universities for activities
in both regions. There is great potential for the further development
of the Chairs programme in the Pacific and Caribbean, given the
existence of the two regional universities mentioned above and
the strong interest of universities in a number of developed countries
(such as Australia, Canada, Japan and Spain) in supporting the
programme. It appears to be particularly well suited for the systems
of higher education in the two regions.

<H3>Funding</H3>

The cost of international cooperation in higher education has risen steadily and this is
currently one of the major obstacles preventing the full use of
the potential of academic links. New information and communication
technologies help reduce costs, but universities in the least-developed
countries would first need considerable investment in order to
procure and maintain the necessary equipment. That is why UNESCO
has based the Chairs programme on funding principles aimed at
lowering costs and sharing them in a genuine spirit of academic
solidarity.
<P>
At the outset, UNESCO made it very clear that, since
it was not a funding agency, it could not, by itself, assume the
financial burden of such an ambitious programme, involving several
hundred instiitutions and thousands of university teachers, researchers
and students. However, it decided to make a commitment by providing
some initial funds. Rough estimates indicate that, over the 1992-1995
period, UNESCO has contributed some $2.5 million (from its Regular
and Participation Programmes, Fellowship Bank and Funds-in-Trust)
to the UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Programme. At the same time, it has
pressed for increased international development aid for higher
education, particularly from the developed countries, and from
international organisations, including the UN specialised agencies.
 A strong case is made for the benefit of pooling resources and
for involving directly the higher education institutions themselves.
<P>
UNITWIN-based projects, including UNESCO Chairs, are usually initiated
through the direct contributions of UNESCO (the range is generally
between $15 000 and  $25 000 per individual project). This is
meant to help prepare and launch projects and to secure further
funding from other sources. The institutions themselves must include
allocations for the respective projects in their own budgets and
request their appropriate national authorities to make contributions.
This applies equally to universities in the developing countries,
however poor their resources may be. It serves to indicate that
the project in question is indeed seen as a priority by them and
by their national authorities.
<P>
Experience of the UNITWIN funding
formula so far gives cause for cautious optimism. Many projects
have been able to secure funds by having recourse to the various
sources mentioned above. Thus, the Utrecht/Southern Africa/UNITWIN
Project received a first UNESCO allocation of $50 000 in 1993,
in order to launch its activities. The fact that it concerned
a large-scale project (a network of eight universities, with four
chairs established at four African universities and one at the
University of Utrecht) explains the larger UNESCO allocation.
This was followed by a second allocation of $70 000 in 1994 for
the actual implementation of activities in Africa. The UNESCO
seed money led to additional funding - $600 000 annually, for
the 1992-1995 period, from various Dutch donors (mainly the Ministry
of Development Cooperation, through NUFFIC) and from the European
Union, and  $450 000 from the University of Utrecht budget, including
the total cost for the functioning of the UNESCO Chair on African
Studies established at that university. The other three European
universities participating in the network (Bochum, Lund and Porto)
have also made contributions and are now looking for donor funding
in their countries. It is important to mention that the four African
universities belonging to the network have also allocated funds
from their own budgets to the UNITWIN projects and are actively
seeking additional resources from aid and development programmes
established for their countries by various donor agencies.
<P>
It can be fairly argued that in terms of cost-effectiveness, efficiency
and the ability to generate funding from various sources, UNITWIN
compares favourably with existing cooperation schemes in higher
education and research. But it is still too early to conclude
that the Chairs Programme can continue and develop further on
the basis of the present funding arrangements. The needs are arguably
too big for the institutions and individuals involved, who may
find themselves in a perpetual search for funds. An evaluation
of the programme is under way and this will be submitted to the
Member States for their decision. UNESCO is hoping that its efforts
to revive academic solidarity, and its campaign in favour of higher
education in the developing countries will receive the support
of the international community. More than ever before, these countries
need to develop their capacity for advanced training and research
in order to achieve self sustainable development. The academic
community has already indicated its willingness to join forces
with UNESCO in this undertaking.

<H3>Britain hit by spring heatwave</H3>
<BR>
Britain was hit by a spring heatwave yesterday that forced farmers to put
suncream on sweltering pigs and London Zoo to cover its rhinos in suntan
lotion. But poor air quality also brought a rise in asthma attacks among
humans and skin cancer warnings. London was hotter than Harare with temperatures
topping 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Centigrade). In the northern country
of Yorkshire, the fire brigade was called out to hose down a trio of overheated
circus elephants.<BR>
<BR>
1. Do you think this was actually true?<BR>
2. Where do you think the journalist got this story?<BR>
3. This was on the front page of the newspaper. What picture of Britain
will Tanzanians get from reading this story?<BR>
4. Find a front page story in a British newspaper that you find hard to
believe. Cut it out and paste it on a piece of paper and say why you chose
it and what picture it gives of the people and the place in the article.
 <BR>
5. What are the dangers of newspapers writing stories which don't have enough
detail, so they give a strange impression?<BR>
6. Write a story about something/someone in your school as if it was for
a newspaper.<BR>
7. What impressions do you get of Africa from the TV and newspapers? Do
you think all the stories you hear of Africa are true?<BR>

<p><b><A NAME="int"></A>
The author of this article offers an academic critique of
the challenges facing the global system of development cooperation
in the post-Cold War era. He argues that the old compromises that
have shaped development assistance since the Second World War
have broken down and pleads for a radical re-think of the strategy
in order to 'enable' less affluent societies to gain from the
advent of global 'free market democracy'.</b>
<P>
 Let us face it. International development cooperation is heading
for crisis. For nearly 50 years, the developed world has taken
aid for granted. It no longer does. In real terms, it has started
to give less. The expected 'peace dividend' has not materialised
and scepticism is rising. Aid and solidarity are considered old-fashioned
concepts. Progress and development, it is increasingly argued,
must come from cooperation based on mutual interest and a businesslike
approach.
<P>
 Aid scepticism is at its highest in the USA. A conservative majority
in Congress promotes radical 'winner' recipes and aid has been
slashed. Slowly but surely, America is getting out of the development
business. Lacking domestic support, the Clinton administration
seeks to 'rescue' the country's aid programme by seeking more
cooperation with other donors - particularly the EU, whose solidarity
horizons do not yet stop at its own borders. But even here, horizons
are shrinking. European aid to its immediate neighbours in the
East and the southern Mediterranean basin has risen. Happy and
prosperous neighbours suddenly seem more important than distant
friends in need.
<P>
 Has the end of the cold war marked the beginning of a cold world
- where international solidarity is being dismantled together
with the nuclear warheads? Or could we be experiencing the beginning
of a fundamental reshaping of international solidarity and aid
between nations?
<P>
<A NAME="bey"><H3><hr>Beyond altruism - self interest</H3></A>
<P>
 International aid has always involved a compromise within <I>affluent
society</I>. People and nations are not normally disposed to give
something away unless they receive something in return. Any attempt
at understanding and reshaping the future of development aid must
therefore start from the premise that those providing development
aid do so as a result of a complex and evolving compromise between
altruism and self-interest.
<P>
 Affluent countries are usually only interested in assisting poorer
ones when the effect is to strengthen their international leadership,
and in some way to enhance their security and material wellbeing.
Looked at in this context, we must recognise that development
aid, whatever its altruistic aims, will only exist if it also
serves the legitimate, albeit more selfish agenda of the donor.
It also means that the compromise which gives aid its rationale
in affluent society changes over time: aid is regularly '<I>recompromised</I>'.
In secure and prosperous times, donors are more inclined to forego
self-interest and to cooperate in the interest of less affluent
countries. In times of insecurity, the altruistic dimension is
likely to diminish in importance.
<P>
In colonial times, systematic aid flows first emerged as a result
of a compromise between expansionist Northern governments and
Christian society with its own 'colonising' clergy. Decolonisation
had the effect of increasing insecurity in most former colonial
powers. In an attempt to safeguard the capital they had 'invested'
in their overseas territories, following the latter's independence,
they increasingly shaped aid with a view to 'buying' goodwill
from the new rulers. This process, which 'recompromised' aid from
a colonial into a neocolonial form, resulted in the secular, institutionalised
arrangement now known as 'bilateral aid'. In addition, during
the Cold War, Western aid was used increasingly as a device to
stop the Third World joining the Second World (the communist bloc).
The result was an aid system which was both more internationalised
and more politicised.
<P>
 The next stage came with the end of the Cold War. Communism had
joined colonialism and fascism in the dustbin of history. Affluent
Western society had emerged as the winner. With it came the Western
vision for stability, peace and progress: a world of sovereign
nations, organised on the basis of democratic and capitalist market
principles and committed to respect for each other's territory
and for basic human rights. Today, capitalism has become the norm
in most nation states. Long-time sceptics such as India, and even
convinced opponents such as China and Vietnam, have embraced it.
Democracy has not yet achieved the same coverage, but it is sailing
forward under favourable conditions. Political pluralism is steadily
being consolidated in much of East and Central Europe, while dictatorial
regimes in Africa, Asia and Latin America are now the exception.
<P>
 The effect of all of this has been a speedy erosion of the terms
of the compromise on which development aid thrived for so long.
In a rapidly globalising, multi-polar world, the old approaches
appear increasingly redundant. From this perspective, the current
aid crisis is not surprising and is not necessarily a bad thing.
Western affluent society is essentially trying to come to terms
with the demystification of its development aid, as part of a
process of reshaping it for the future.
<P>
<A NAME="thr"><H3><HR>Three 'recompromising' strategies</H3></A>
<P>
 As in the past, the recompromising process is influenced by both
self-interest and altruism in affluent society. Three trends can
be identified. The first, which is the most idealistic, involves
<I>restoring altruism</I>. This approach seeks to 'purge' aid
of the perverse political and economic compromises and contradictions
caused by decades of neocolonial and Cold-War self-interest. It
has impacted on aid in several ways. First, it has given a significant
boost to humanitarian aid - the most altruistic form - at the
expense of development assistance. Second, it has led to a 'decentralisation'
of aid - with more assistance being channelled through organisations
such as NGOs, that have an 'uncompromised' altruistic profile.
Third, it has led to a 'deconstruction' of development aid along
idealistic-altruistic lines. 'Women in development', 'child health',
'environment' and 'poverty alleviation' are all examples of deconstructed
labels around which aid is increasingly being structured and justified.
Finally, it has prompted an 'intellectualisation' of development
aid with the particular purpose of tightening its altruistic aims.
For example, the Logical Framework Approach, the concept of 'sustainable
development', the UNDP's Human Development Index and various experiments
with more 'accountable' project management systems, have all essentially
been devised as ways of encapsulating and supporting the altruistic
intentions that lie behind aid.
<P>
 The second recompromising strategy, which may be summed up in
the expression <I>be businesslike</I>, approaches development
cooperation much more sceptically. Aid, it is argued, only makes
sense if it leads to real progress and development - and the prevailing
view is that this is not happening. The approach is fueled by
the obsession of trying to measure progress with the help of business
tools such as 'output', 'impact', 'efficiency', 'rates of return'
and so on. This has led to burgeoning aid 'evaluation'. It has
also probably contributed to the discovery of aid failures which,
in turn, has prompted growing criticism of aid agencies and operators.
The businesslike strategy has gained further ground because of
the failure of many countries to achieve any real progress in
recent decades. Its advocates argue that the compromises which
undermined aid's development impact in the past are inherently
linked with its altruistic nature. The conclusion is that altruistic
aid will seldom or never work. The strategy has impacted on aid
in a number of ways  being, for example, the major cause of so-called
'aid fatigue'. It has also prompted a search for ways to enhance
cooperation for mutual benefit, indeed transforming the narrow,
pre-Cold War <I>trade</I> cooperation link with developing countries
into a much broader and rapidly growing <I>economic</I> cooperation
approach. Finally, it has sought to enhance aid's impact on the
economic conditions and growth prospects of developing countries
through more ambitious, structural-oriented forms of aid.
<P>
<I> Regionalism</I>, the third major strategy, is linked to globalisation.
Rooted in human survival psychology, this approach prompts nations
in close proximity to form 'strategic' coalitions. In the post-Cold
War era, development aid is one of the instruments used by affluent
regions to strengthen their position in a 'globalising' environment.
The strategy entails promoting 'open' regionalism elsewhere in
the world and capitalising on this to create linkages and interactions
which enhance their own influence or hegemony. From the point
of view of the international political economy, this makes perfect
sense. Having succeeded in making the 'world of nations' accept
capitalism and democracy, it is through the consolidation process
of free market democracy in other countries and regions that powerful
affluent nations will seek to gain maximum advantage.
<P>
<A NAME="nee"><H3><HR>Need for a vision</H3></A>
<P>
 With this improved insight into the dynamics that have been reshaping
development aid, is it now possible to go further and develop
a more political vision of relations between affluent and less
affluent nations in future?
<P>
 Free market democracy, having endured the 'crises' of decolonisation,
fascism and communism, has succeeded in promoting stability and
peace within and between nations. Its main strength has probably
been its crucial <I>enabling</I> function, with an increasing
number of people and nations now in a position to 'earn' a better
future. It appears that the model has the capacity to generate
fairly equitable growth and progress, which is presumably why
more and more countries are turning to it. As is so often the
case, however, the strength of the system also contains the seeds
of its weakness. Conceived as an 'enabling' mechanism, it results
in the categorisation of those who fail to 'be enabled' as 'unable'.
Marginalised because they cannot participate and perform in the
system, the excluded (whether individuals or states) are dubbed
'losers'. They are seen as a burden and a threat by the 'winners'.
The result is <I>disparity</I> in society.
<P>
 Experience in most affluent nations suggests that despite the
enabling environment created by free-market democracy, up to a
quarter of the population finds itself unable to perform effectively,
and is marginalised as a result. Moreover, there seems to be an
upward trend in the numbers affected by unemployment, underemployment
and poverty. Disparity never occurs without some cost to society,
which is a good reason why it ought to be minimised. The costs
come mainly in the form of internal transfers earned (but foregone)
by the active, 'winning' section of society. In more socially-inspired,
free market democracies, it is accepted that marginalisation resulting
from the model's shortcomings must be minimised and/or adequately
compensated for. In more conservative free market democracies,
exclusion is seen more as a weakness of individuals than of the
system. Compensatory transfers are generally kept to a minimum
to induce people to 'break out' of their situation. But while
such societies may save on 'empathetic' transfers, they will generally
need to spend much more of their wealth defending against threats
posed by growing disparity, such as crime, drug-trafficking and
political extremism.
<P>
 The costs of disparity are political as well as financial. Genuine
democracy is based on the participation of a representative majority
of citizens. In affluent societies, however, a growing minority
no longer participates. The real danger stems from the fact that
this is highly skewed. It is the same, growing, marginalised minority
that is 'unable' to participate which is also withdrawing from
democratic involvement. The result is alienation from the political
system and an erosion of democracy to the extent that its very
survival may be threatened.
<P>
<A NAME="wha"><H3><HR>What is really at stake</H3></A>
<P>
 Having conquered most of the world's nations, free market capitalism
is now set to conquer the <I>world of nations</I>, helped by technological
advances in communications, transport and computer technology.
Economists have amply shown that the interdependence resulting
from free international competition need not be detrimental. Indeed,
because global capitalism ensures that ideas, initiatives and
resources can be 'put to work' anywhere in the world - wherever
they generate most profit - interdependence is usually seen as
mutually beneficial. In essence, it confirms what might be called
the <I>global enabling effect</I> of free-market capitalism. The
basic thesis is that the adoption by less affluent nations of
free market democracy should 'enable' many more of them to improve
the lives of their people in the coming decades. The boost engendered
by this 'enabling effect' will, in turn, help to sustain progress
in the more affluent countries.
<P>
 If this is the aim, then a new vision should progressively inspire
future cooperation between the affluent and less affluent countries.
The first concern should be to define 'purpose' and 'interest'
much more in terms of system and process, than of output. What
really matters is the 'enabling potential' of free market democracy
in the specific context of the less affluent countries. <I>How</I>
something is achieved and<I> by whom </I>should take precedence
over <I>what</I> is achieved. The ultimate aim must be to ensure
that free-market democracy 'takes root' in less affluent nations
and is able to determine who does what and how.
<P>
 A second major concern should be to maximise the 'enabling potential'
of free market democracy for the most vulnerable sections of individual
populations. As mentioned earlier, up to a quarter of the people
in affluent societies are excluded. In poorer countries, the figure
is much higher. If free market democracy fails to enable a significant
proportion of this marginalised group, then it will not take root.
And if the poor cannot be mobilised, the growth that does occur
will be highly skewed, leading to growing disparity.
<P>
 A third point is to ensure that the 'global enabling' effect
of free market capitalism does not become the exclusive preserve
of deregulated capital and the 'winners' who control it, leading
to new forms of exploitation and disparity. The concern must be
to find a way of directing the combined forces of 'capitalism
without borders' and 'democracy within borders' in such a way
that it leads to a genuinely better world in which the number
of 'losers' is dropping and disparities are diminishing.
<P>
<A NAME="his"><H3><HR>A historic perspective</H3></A>
<P>
 It is useful at this stage to take a look at the history of capitalism.
Free-market democracy delivered affluence to about a third of
the global population over the last century mainly because of
the 'accommodation' between labour and capital in an enabling
environment created by 'Fordist' mass-production and consumption.
A similar accommodation is now needed to enable global free market
democracy to extend material wellbeing to the remaining two-thirds
of the (continually growing) world population, while at the same
time sustaining it among the existing affluent third. It is no
longer an accommodation between capitalists and workers that is
required, however, but one beween the affluent and the less affluent.
<P>
 Fordism basically transformed the 'interdependent' stake of capital
and labour in the economic pie, into a 'joint stake' - leading
to the production of a larger pie. By analogy, what is needed
today is to ensure that affluent and less affluent societies develop
a joint stake in the production of a larger 'global pie' as a
result of new technologies and more efficient, globalised modes
of production. Attracting and sustaining capitalist investment
in such modes will increasingly depend on demand and consumption
structures which guarantee that poorer societies share with affluent
ones the benefits of such global production systems. In the same
way that a larger 'mass-produced pie' was dependent on higher
and more equitable mass consumption, so will a larger 'globally-produced
pie' depend increasingly on higher and more equitable global consumption.
In this context, the principal policy aim of development cooperation
should be to ensure that growth resulting from globalisation is
both enabling and disparity-reducing.
<P>
<A NAME="dis"><H3><HR>The disabling effect of 'poor' competition</H3></A>
<P>
 Driven by the powerful motive of capital accumulation, globalisation
has the tendency to promote competition. In principle, this should
be a good thing, but left unchanneled, it can have negative effects.
One might draw an analogy between the conquering of the global
market and the spread of water during a flood. The water  always
takes the easiest route, entering the most vulnerable areas first
where it causes the most damage. Likewise, globalisation, fueled
by 'deregulated' capital, often tends to promote competition where
it is easiest, but where it is not necessarily beneficial. This
is the case, for example, in less affluent countries, where poverty
is exploited to achieve what might be dubbed a 'poor' competitive
advantage - in the sense that it is based on disparity, but also
in that, far from 'enabling', it may actually have the opposite
effect. Child labour, sex tourism, environmentally destructive
tourism, tropical forest logging, the export of industrial pollution
and misuse of intellectual property are all examples of 'disabling'
competition resulting from global disparity. In a rapidly globalising
world this is ultimately damaging to all concerned, which is why
both affluent and less affluent nations have an interest in reducing
the gap.
<P>
 All of this points to the need for a major redefinition of society's
role in general and of aid in particular. During the colonial
and Cold War periods, development cooperation was progressively
uprooted and alienated from society. Serving an increasingly complex
and non-transparent agenda, it became more and more a 'cockpit'
affair, piloted by a small specialised crew - and it found itself
flying higher and higher above society. In short, affluent society
lost touch with development cooperation and aid. Occasionally,
the media intervened to 're-establish contact' but the result
was that development aid usually only attracted mainstream public
attention when things had gone terribly wrong.
<P>
<A NAME="tur"><H3><HR>Turning vision into action</H3></A>
<P>
 If the aim is to have affluent and less affluent society working
together to ensure that the latter adopts 'free market democracy'
- and can adapt it in a way which benefits both - it is vital
that the former be reconnected to the business of development
cooperation. The affluent must be challenged to help transform
their less affluent partners, in the interested and creative manner
of a minority stakeholder. They must be ready to share the wealth
of knowledge and experience generated in their own process of
development. Representatives of all walks of affluent life should
therefore be provided with greater opportunity for dialogue and
cooperation with their less affluent counterparts. Increasingly
easy and cheap communications and transport should facilitate
this. This new form of stakeholdership will not happen, however,
unless affluent society can be imbued with the new vision.
<P>
 Donors should actively support the process. Instead of spending
most of their time and resources determining the scope and content
of development cooperation, they should step down from their cockpit.
Their new role should be as brokers and facilitators of cooperation.
An initial priority must be to extol the vision itself. As this
gathers momentum, they should then turn to 'brokering' it in practice
- acting as a catalyst between the affluent and less affluent
in order to facilitate 'enabling' cooperation between them. The
development of an effective brokerage profile and methodology
will probably entail important changes in the way that donors
work. They need to move much closer to their constituency, and
to be made democratically accountable again.
<P>
 As mentioned earlier, the concept of enabling cooperation concentrates
on who does what, and how. Essentially, therefore, it should be
seeking to mobilise democratic and free market forces in less
affluent societies. The advantage of working this way is that
change and progress will be determined primarily from within the
society in question - with cooperation as a source of encouragement.
Such an approach also entails acceptance of the fact that the
pace of progress must be left much more to the enabling forces
of the maturing democracies and free markets, however weak and
imperfect these may still appear. Indeed, the central purpose
of cooperation should be to help these forces become stronger.
To achieve this, cooperation will need to move away from an emphasis
on engineering outputs to one which involves 'massaging' the system
and process. And it is not just methodologies that need to be
altered; there must also be a radical change in cooperation mentality.
Thus, for example, donors should attempt to broker cooperation
which is 'small but smart'. Advancing 'best practice' might be
another creative way to pursue cooperation which is enabling.
And while some output-related decision techniques can still be
used, these must be creatively reshaped to support a more 'enabling'
approach. 
<P>
 In conclusion, this enabling vision entails an awareness of the
imperfections of free-market democracy, combined with a conviction
that it offers enormous potential for the less affluent countries
of the world. 'Recompromising' development aid for the future
will mean reshaping it to support a process of adoption and adaptation
of free market democracy in less affluent countries which is highly
'enabling'. The result should be a system of international solidarity
which is working for free-market democracy, rather than as a substitute
for it.

<P>
The question of the coherence between European sectoral policies
and development cooperation policy is not some distant technocratic
debate in Brussels, but a major issue for the development of many
countries, and consequently for the effectiveness and credibility
of European development policy.
<P>
For many years, observers have condemned the contradictions between
policy on trade and agriculture and policy on development cooperation,
which reduce the effectiveness of the latter. Cereals and meat
are two products most often cited.
<P>
Coherence has been an official item on the working agenda of the
European Commission since the Maastricht Treaty was signed, which
marks a notable advance for the European Union in the re-examination
of its international relations. As yet, however, few answers or
ideas have been suggested to advance the discussion and provide
solutions to the problems.
<P>
This study first defines the notion of coherence and presents
the various aspects of EU policy to which it applies. Six case-studies
in the farm sector identify how coherence could be applied: beef,
poultry, milk and milk products, processed tomatoes, cereals,
and potatoes. The study ends by making proposals for institutional
mechanisms within the European Commission to avoid or resolve
the contradictions found, so as to improve the effectiveness of
EU development cooperation policy.

<I><B>&quot;D&eacute;termin&eacute;s &agrave; &eacute;tablir les
fondements d'une union sans cesse plus &eacute;troite entre les
peuples europ&eacute;ens&quot;</B></I> 
<P>
<B>Ainsi d&eacute;butait le Trait&eacute; instituant la CEE sign&eacute;
par les six Etats membres fondateurs en 1957. Si le Trait&eacute;
a &eacute;t&eacute; modifi&eacute; &agrave; plusieurs reprises
depuis lors, au fur et &agrave; mesure de l'&eacute;volution des
Communaut&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes, cette disposition particuli&egrave;re
du pr&eacute;ambule est demeur&eacute;e intacte. Nombreux sont
d'ailleurs ceux qui la consid&egrave;rent comme sacro-sainte :
ne refl&egrave;te-t-elle pas le souhait des &quot;p&egrave;res
fondateurs&quot; d'une Europe unie tout en reconnaissant qu'il
s'agirait n&eacute;cessairement d'un processus &eacute;volutif
?</B> 
<P>
D&egrave;s la fin des ann&eacute;es 1950, l'&eacute;volution de
la CE s'est inscrite dans cet objectif &quot;d'une union sans
cesse plus &eacute;troite&quot; - m&ecirc;me si le processus a
parfois sembl&eacute; extr&ecirc;mement lent. Les &quot;Six&quot;
sont devenus 15 tandis qu'une douzaine d'autres pays attendent
en coulisses. Les comp&eacute;tences de la Communaut&eacute; ont
&eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;largies et le March&eacute; unique a
&eacute;t&eacute; mis en place. Par ses arr&ecirc;ts, la Cour
europ&eacute;enne de Justice a fermement &eacute;tabli la pr&eacute;s&eacute;ance
du droit communautaire. Elu au suffrage direct, le Parlement est
d&eacute;sormais dot&eacute; de v&eacute;ritables pouvoirs.
<P>
Il a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;cid&eacute; que 1996 serait une
nouvelle &eacute;tape majeure du processus d'int&eacute;gration
europ&eacute;enne avec l'organisation d'une Conf&eacute;rence
intergouvernementale (CIG) essentiellement consacr&eacute;e &agrave;
l'examen du fonctionnement institutionnel de l'UE. S'il est pratiquement
certain que l'expression &quot;union sans cesse plus &eacute;troite&quot;
sortira intacte des n&eacute;gociations, qu'adviendra-t-il de
l'esprit m&ecirc;me du pr&eacute;ambule? La question est incontestablement
pos&eacute;e.
<P>
Le rendez-vous de 1996 a &eacute;t&eacute; pris &agrave; l'&eacute;poque
des n&eacute;gociations de Maastricht (Article N du Trait&eacute;
sur l'Union europ&eacute;enne). Le processus de ratification de
ce Trait&eacute;, qui pr&eacute;voyait notamment la cr&eacute;ation
d'une monnaie unique, s'est av&eacute;r&eacute; beaucoup plus
traumatique que pr&eacute;vu. Qui aurait pens&eacute; qu'il faudrait
deux r&eacute;f&eacute;rendums au Danemark pour le faire approuver?
La France y est parvenue au premier essai - mais ce fut de justesse.
Le suspense a encore dur&eacute; pendant les longues semaines
qu'il a fallu au Parlement britannique pour examiner le projet
de loi portant application des dispositions de Maastricht.
<P>
La n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une r&eacute;vision fondamentale
des m&eacute;canismes d&eacute;cisionnels de l'UE est largement
reconnue, sans faire l'unanimit&eacute; pour autant. Le syst&egrave;me
a &eacute;t&eacute; initialement con&ccedil;u pour une Communaut&eacute;
de six pays et le moment est venu, affirme-t-on, de l'adapter
au fonctionnement d'une Union de quinze membres. Certains craignent,
en effet, que les rouages finissent par se bloquer au fur et &agrave;
mesure d'un &eacute;largissement &eacute;ventuel vers le sud et
vers l'est. Le Trait&eacute; a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute;
amend&eacute; &agrave; plusieurs reprises en vue d'accro&icirc;tre
l'efficacit&eacute; du syst&egrave;me. C'est ainsi, par exemple,
que les mati&egrave;res requ&eacute;rant une &quot;majorit&eacute;
qualifi&eacute;e&quot; plut&ocirc;t qu'une &quot;unanimit&eacute;&quot;
ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tendues. En d'autres termes, le
&quot;veto&quot; national a d&eacute;j&agrave; disparu de certains
domaines d'action. Dans le m&ecirc;me temps, la complexit&eacute;
du syst&egrave;me s'est accrue suite essentiellement &agrave;
l'octroi de pouvoirs par bribes au Parlement europ&eacute;en.
Dans certains domaines, et en mati&egrave;re budg&eacute;taire
notamment, le Parlement constitue l'institution centrale dont
l'approbation est d&eacute;terminante. Dans d'autres, le Parlement
et la Commission peuvent effectivement prendre des d&eacute;cisions
contre l'avis du Conseil des Ministres. De mani&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale,
le Conseil conserve les grands pouvoirs l&eacute;gislatifs et
la Commission garde le &quot;droit d'initiative&quot; mais la
multiplication des proc&eacute;dures l&eacute;gislatives complique
singuli&egrave;rement la t&acirc;che de tous ceux qui participent
au syst&egrave;me. Cette situation n'&eacute;chappe pas &agrave;
l'opinion publique : rares sont les observateurs ext&eacute;rieurs
qui comprennent ce qui se passe &agrave; &quot;Bruxelles&quot;,
et plus rares encore ceux qui se sentent concern&eacute;s.

le 29 mars), la Commission a voulu tenir compte de ces pr&eacute;occupations.
Elle souligne un point &quot;essentiel&quot;, &agrave; savoir
que l'approfondissement et l'&eacute;largissement sont ins&eacute;parables,
et parle d'une Union plus proche de ses citoyens. Elle insiste
&eacute;galement sur l'importance d'un &quot;syst&egrave;me institutionnel
propre &agrave; fonctionner dans une Europe &eacute;largie&quot;.
Mais la CIG ne peut aboutir, d&eacute;clare le Pr&eacute;sident
Santer, que si le processus est soutenu par une &quot;v&eacute;ritable
volont&eacute; politique&quot;.
<P>
La Commission poursuit en formulant une s&eacute;rie d'orientations
concr&egrave;tes &agrave; l'intention de la CIG (voir notre encadr&eacute;).
Elle met l'accent, en ce qui concerne ses principaux domaines
d'action, sur le renforcement de la dimension sociale de l'Europe,
le d&eacute;veloppement d'une strat&eacute;gie commune pour l'emploi
et une attention accrue &agrave; la protection de l'environnement.
Une proposition en particulier risque de se heurter &agrave; une
certaine r&eacute;ticence : il s'agit de l'int&eacute;gration
du protocole social de Maastricht dans le Trait&eacute;. Nos lecteurs
se souviendront que le Royaume-Uni n'a pas sign&eacute; l'accord
sur la politique sociale il y a quatre ans - et l'on voit mal
comment, en l'absence d'une unanimit&eacute; parmi les Etats membres,
ce domaine d'action pourrait &ecirc;tre officiellement int&eacute;gr&eacute;
dans le corps du Trait&eacute;.
<P>
La Commission pr&ocirc;ne par ailleurs la r&eacute;forme du &quot;pilier&quot;
de la justice et des affaires int&eacute;rieures. Ce domaine nouveau
d'action commune, d&eacute;cid&eacute; &agrave; Maastricht, a
&eacute;t&eacute; exclu de la structure de la Communaut&eacute;
europ&eacute;enne en faveur d'un processus &quot;intergouvernemental&quot;
plus traditionnel. La proposition cl&eacute; porte sur le transfert
des domaines de la justice et des affaires int&eacute;rieures
vers le cadre communautaire, &agrave; l'exception de la coop&eacute;ration
judiciaire en mati&egrave;re p&eacute;nale et de la coop&eacute;ration
polici&egrave;re.
<P>
Etant donn&eacute; que les aspects institutionnels seront au coeur
des pourparlers de la CIG, il n'est gu&egrave;re surprenant que
les recommandations principales de la Commission portent sur la
r&eacute;forme du syst&egrave;me l&eacute;gislatif. A son avis,
les deux &eacute;l&eacute;ments cl&eacute;s sont, &agrave; cet
&eacute;gard, le remplacement, en principe, de l'unanimit&eacute;
par la majorit&eacute; qualifi&eacute;e et la simplification des
proc&eacute;dures d&eacute;cisionnelles (limit&eacute;es &agrave;
trois). Il est significatif que la Commission recommande &eacute;galement
de &quot;poursuivre la mise en oeuvre du principe de subsidiarit&eacute;&quot;
et de &quot;mieux associer les Parlements nationaux aux affaires
de l'Union en leur fournissant &agrave; temps toute information
n&eacute;cessaire&quot;.
<P>
La Commission r&eacute;clame, de mani&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale,
l'instauration de proc&eacute;dures plus simples dans l'ensemble
du syst&egrave;me et sugg&egrave;re, &agrave; propos d'institutions
particuli&egrave;res, une s&eacute;rie de changements plus sp&eacute;cifiques
portant, par exemple, sur l'ordre de rotation des semestres pr&eacute;sidentiels,
la r&eacute;duction du nombre de Commissaires europ&eacute;ens,
la dur&eacute;e du mandat des membres de la Cour europ&eacute;enne
et un mode d'&eacute;lection du Parlement &quot;qui assure au
mieux la repr&eacute;sentativit&eacute; des &eacute;lus&quot;.
<P>
Enfin, plusieurs propositions visent &agrave; &quot;affirmer la
politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
commune&quot; et &agrave; &eacute;voluer vers une d&eacute;fense
commune. Dans ce dernier domaine, il est sugg&eacute;r&eacute;
de &quot;r&eacute;examiner le r&ocirc;le de l'Union de l'Europe
Occidentale en vue de son int&eacute;gration dans l'Union&quot;.
<P>
<a name="vis"><h3>Des visions diff&eacute;rentes</h3></a>
<P>
Les propositions de la Commission en vue de la CIG sont conformes
&agrave; l'id&eacute;al d'une &quot;union sans cesse plus &eacute;troite&quot;,
ce qui est absolument logique de la part d'une institution d&eacute;sign&eacute;e
comme la &quot;gardienne des Trait&eacute;s&quot;. Elles rel&egrave;vent
davantage de l'&eacute;volution que de la r&eacute;volution puisqu'elles
ont pour principe de base que le maintien du fonctionnement du
syst&egrave;me passe par l'adaptation des structures en place
plut&ocirc;t que par leur d&eacute;mant&egrave;lement et leur
remplacement int&eacute;gral. Elles n'en contiennent pas moins
une s&eacute;rie d'id&eacute;es appel&eacute;es &agrave; susciter
la controverse. Si, de l'avis g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, l'UE souffre
d'un &quot;d&eacute;ficit d&eacute;mocratique&quot;, la moindre
valorisation du r&ocirc;le du Parlement, aussi modeste soit-elle,
ne manquera pas de provoquer une lev&eacute;e de boucliers dans
certaines capitales nationales. La suppression du veto est une
suggestion pragmatique visant &agrave; &eacute;viter la paralysie
future de l'Union mais elle touche une fibre &quot;nationale&quot;
particuli&egrave;rement sensible dans certains Etats membres.
L'id&eacute;e d'une approche commune de la d&eacute;fense, sans
&ecirc;tre une v&eacute;ritable r&eacute;volution puisque de nombreux
pays de l'UE ont mis leurs &quot;souverainet&eacute;s&quot; en
commun dans le cadre de l'OTAN, rencontre une opposition extr&ecirc;mement
vive de la part de certains politiciens nationaux.
<P>
La difficult&eacute; fondamentale semble r&eacute;sider dans les
visions diff&eacute;rentes, voire incompatibles, de ce que l'Union
europ&eacute;enne devrait &ecirc;tre. L'Europe doit-elle continuer
de rechercher cette &quot;union sans cesse plus &eacute;troite&quot;
? Dans l'affirmative, on voit mal comment elle peut atteindre
cet objectif sans mettre en place une sorte de syst&egrave;me
f&eacute;d&eacute;ral - bien que de nombreux partisans de l'int&eacute;gration
pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent &eacute;viter ce terme par crainte de
provoquer un retour d'&quot;euroscepticisme&quot;. Doit-elle revenir
&agrave; une structure intergouvernementale plus traditionnelle
? L'id&eacute;e d'une &quot;Europe des Nations&quot; fait son
chemin dans plusieurs Etats membres ; elle est &agrave; l'&eacute;tude
en d&eacute;pit de sa contradiction apparente avec le pr&eacute;ambule
du Trait&eacute; vis-&agrave;-vis duquel tous les membres sont
th&eacute;oriquement engag&eacute;s. La troisi&egrave;me possibilit&eacute;
serait de laisser le syst&egrave;me pratiquement inchang&eacute;.
&quot;Jusqu'ici et pas plus loin&quot; est devenu le refrain favori
de certains - tandis que d'autres affirment que, faute d'un d&eacute;veloppement
dynamique, la structure va s'effondrer. Comme le r&eacute;p&egrave;tent
&agrave; plaisir les juristes, la Communaut&eacute; europ&eacute;enne
est <I>sui generis</I>, et certains la voient en &eacute;quilibre
sur un fil entre l'organisation r&eacute;gionale et l'Etat &agrave;
part enti&egrave;re. S'il en est effectivement ainsi, pas question
d'opter pour l'immobilit&eacute; : que ce soit en avant ou en
arri&egrave;re, il n'y a d'autre choix que de rester en mouvement.
<P>
La Commission, qui participe &agrave; la CIG sans y avoir de droit
de vote, n'est pas la seule &agrave; avoir annonc&eacute; la couleur.
Les acteurs cl&eacute;s de ce processus particulier sont incontestablement
les Etats membres et ils ont publi&eacute;, eux aussi, des documents
de prise de position attestant d'une grande diversit&eacute; d'opinions
quant &agrave; l'orientation future de l'UE. La n&eacute;gociation
s'annonce serr&eacute;e et les commentateurs n'excluent pas qu'elle
se poursuive pendant pr&egrave;s d'un an (avec interruption de
session !). On voit difficilement aujourd'hui comment faire r&eacute;sonner
en harmonie des voix aussi discordantes. Mais, comme <I>Le Courrier</I>
l'a d&eacute;j&agrave; soulign&eacute; &agrave; plusieurs reprises,
l'Union a le don particulier de concilier des positions apparemment
inconciliables.
<P>
La CIG pourrait aboutir &agrave; l'&eacute;dification d'un syst&egrave;me
comportant davantage de niveaux et laissant le choix aux Etats
membres de participer ou non &agrave; certains volets du processus
d'int&eacute;gration. La Commission rejette express&eacute;ment
l'id&eacute;e d'une approche &agrave; la carte mais reconna&icirc;t
la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une certaine flexibilit&eacute;.
La possibilit&eacute; pour des Etats membres de s'int&eacute;grer
&agrave; certains domaines d'action &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
du cadre communautaire est clairement envisag&eacute;e, &eacute;tant
entendu que la Commission consid&egrave;re que d'autres pays doivent
&ecirc;tre libres d'adh&eacute;rer ult&eacute;rieurement &agrave;
ce type d'accords s'ils le veulent et le peuvent. Dans un contexte
europ&eacute;en plus large, cette approche &agrave; niveaux multiples
existe depuis longtemps puisque plusieurs instances ont des effectifs
diff&eacute;rents qui se recoupent souvent (Union europ&eacute;enne,
Conseil de l'Europe, Union de l'Europe Occidentale, Groupe de
Schengen, etc.). Toutefois, en ce qui concerne la structure communautaire,
cette approche s'est bas&eacute;e jusqu'en 1992 sur l'application
universelle des r&egrave;gles. Or le Trait&eacute; de Maastricht
a accord&eacute; une exemption au Royaume-Uni et au Danemark en
ce qui concerne la monnaie unique, et tout le monde s'accorde
&agrave; dire aujourd'hui que, m&ecirc;me si le calendrier d'introduction
de l'<I>Euro</I> devrait &ecirc;tre respect&eacute;, plusieurs
autres Etats membres ne pourraient y adh&eacute;rer imm&eacute;diatement.
Rappelons, en outre, que le Royaume-Uni n'a pas sign&eacute; le
Protocole social. Certains voient ces exemptions comme des fissures
susceptibles de mettre en p&eacute;ril l'&eacute;difice europ&eacute;en
&agrave; terme. En derni&egrave;re analyse, toutefois, il s'agit
peut-&ecirc;tre de la seule mani&egrave;re r&eacute;aliste de
poursuivre la route vers &quot;une union sans cesse plus &eacute;troite&quot;.

<h2><a href="background.html">Mr Ali Naji Awad al-Adhami</a></h2>

Born in Al-Shajara village in Galilee, Naji al-Ali developed a stark and symbolic style during his thirty year cartooning campaign on behalf of Palestinians.  Unaligned with any political party he strove to speak to and for ordinary Arab people.  Due to the invasion of his country, censorship and threats, he was forced to leave Palestine with his family in 1948 to live in exile in south Lebanon.  For the rest of his life he was to remain in exile until finally he was assassinated in 1987 in London at the age of 49.
<p>

He had been very widely published and few regimes or political groups in the region had escaped his satire.  He had condemned the absence of human rights in the region, the Gulf War, Palestinian excesses and religious fanaticism.  He was said to have antagonised virtually everyone in the Middle East; Arab, Jew, conservative and radical alike.
<p>

At the time he was shot a Kuwaiti journalist explained "His cartoons are incredibly effective - and often quite offensive".  He was said to have received over one hundred death threats and to be one of the most wanted men in the Middle East.
<p>

He was posthumously awarded the annual Golden Pen award of the International Federation of Newspaper Publishers (FIEJ) in 1988.

<h2>Mr Ali Naji Awad al-Adhami</h2>

Naji al-Ali developed a stark and symbolic style during his thirty year campaign on behalf of Palestinians.  Unaligned with any political party he strove to speak to and for ordinary Arab people. 

<p>Naji al-Ali's life was seamlessly interwoven with the trials of exiled Palestinians.  Due to invasion, censorship and threats he lived in exile most of his life, much of the time between Beirut and Kuwait.  The last two years of his life he spent in London.

<h3>Background, motivation & influences</h3>

Though the exact date of his birth would appear uncertain, he was born in 1936 or 1937 in Al-Shajara village between Nazra and Tiberias in Galile.  He left Palestine with his family in 1948 to live in-exile in the south of Lebanon on the Ein-Al-Helwe Palestinian camp.

<p>In the late 1950's the late Palestinian poet Gassan El-Kanafani discovered Naji's talent in drawing while on a visit to this camp.

<p>"I started to use drawing as a form of political expression while in Lebanese jails.  I was detained by the Deuxime Bureau (the Lebanese intelligence service) as a result of the measures the Bureau were undertaking to contain political activities in the Palestinian camps during the sixties.  I drew on the prison walls and subsequently Ghassan Kanafani, a journalist and publisher of al-Huria magazine (assassinated in Beirut in 1971) saw some of those drawings and encouraged me to continue, and eventually  published some of my cartoons."

<p>At the time of his death in 1987 he was living with his wife and five children in south London.

<p>In 1992 an International Cartoon Exhibition was held in the Kufa Gallery in London in commemoration of Naji al-Ali and his work.


<h3>Work, interests and philosophy</h3>

In the early 1960's he joined an Art Institute in Lebanon but discontinued his studies  to work in Kuwait on Al-Tali'a Kuwaiti Magazine.

<p>"Later I fled to Kuwait.  The margin of freedom and democracy that exists in Kuwait enabled me to grow.  There my cartoons concentrated on the dangers surrounding us as people."

<p>In the early 1970's he returned to Beirut from Kuwait and was on the Editorial Board of the prominent Lebanese newspaper Al-Safir:

<p>"Working for al-Safir newspaper in Beirut in 1971 was the best part of my life, and the most productive.  There, surrounded by the violence of many an army, and finally by the Israeli invasion, I stood facing it all with my pen every day.  I never felt fear, failure or despair, and I didn't surrender.  I faced armies with cartoons and drawings of flowers, hope and bullets.  Yes, hope is essential, always.  My work in Beirut made me once again closer to the refugees in the camps, the poor, and the harassed."

<p>During this period he also contributed drawings to Al-Khalij newspaper.

<p>The Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982.  Fearing Phalangist threats on his life Naji al-Ali returned to Kuwait in 1983 and worked in Al-Qabas (meaning 'The Light' in English) newspaper - the largest independent daily newspaper in the Middle East.

<p>In 1984 he began to publish his work in Al-Khalij.

<p>In October 1985 he was expelled from Kuwait by pressure from Saudi Arabia but continued to work for the same the Kuwaiti newspaper, Al-Qabas, in London and continued to contribute his work to Al-Khalij.

<p>His work was published daily in Cairo, Beirut, Kuwait, Tunis, Abu Dhabi, London and Paris in publications ranging from far Right to far Left.  He is thought to have been the highest paid cartoonist in the Arab world.

<p>Naji al-Ali had no political affiliations and the absence of slogans and dogma in his work brought both success and criticism.  He was opposed to terrorism and the absence of democracy and, not belonging to any political group, tried to be a true representative of Arab public opinion.

<p>"As soon as I was aware of what was going on, all the havoc in our region, I felt I had to do something, to contribute somehow.  First I tried politics, to join a party, I marched in demonstrations, but that was not really me.  The sharp cries I felt within me needed a different medium to express what I was going through.  It was some time in the fifties that I started drawing on the walls of our camp.  During that period, the refugees had begun to develop some political awareness as a reaction to what had been taking place in the region: a revolution in Egypt, a war of independence in Algeria, things were brewing all around the Arab world.  My job I felt was to speak up for those people, my people who are in the camps, in Egypt, in Algeria, the simple Arabs all over the region who have very few outlets to express their points of view.  I felt my job was to incite them.  For the function of a political cartoonist, as I see it, is to provide a new vision.  He is a missionary, in a sense, because it is just a little bit harder to censor a cartoon than an article."

<p>Few regimes or political groups in the region escaped his satirical drawings.  He condemned the absence of human rights in the region, the Gulf War, Palestinian excesses and religious fanaticism.  He was said to have antagonised virtually everyone in the Middle East; Arab, Jew, conservative and radical alike.

<p>He believed his period of work in Beirut was the best part of his career and that his periods of exile in Kuwait and the UK restricted his creativeness in ways he could not understand and counter.  He missed the inspiration of the reality of the refugee camps in southern Lebanon.

<p>Naji al-Ali's philosophy can perhaps be best encapsulated in his explanation about Hanzala, the little boys who appears as a spectator in each of his cartoons:

<p>"This child, as you can see is neither beautiful, spoilt, nor even well-fed.  He is barefoot like many children in refugee camps.  He is actually ugly and no woman would wish to have a child like him.  However, those who came to know 'Hanzala', as I discovered later adopted him and later adopted him because he is affectionate, honest, outspoken, and a bum.  He is an icon that stands to watch me from slipping.  And his hands behind his back are a symbol of rejection of all the present negative tides in our region."

<p>Hanzala is now the official logo of the Commission for Freedom and Justice Through Humour, a recently created arm of WATCH and an affiliate of UNESCO.


<h3>Censorship</h3>

Strict censorship and high illiteracy rates exist in many middle eastern countries.
 
Between 1958 and 1963 Naji al-Ali was frequently detained by police and continually censored.  He is said to have received over one hundred death threats during his life.  Because of his work he was said to be one of the most wanted men in the Middle East and this forced him to leave Lebanon and work in Kuwait and London.

<p>He emphatically refused to speak about his oppressors and those who might censor his work; he drew them instead.

<p>On Wednesday July 22nd, 1987 he was shot in the head by a lone gunman as he left the Al-Qabas offices in Ives Street, Chelsea.  After five weeks in a coma on a life support machine in a St Stephen's and Charing Cross hospitals in London, he died at 5am on Saturday 30th August at the age of 49.

<p>Apparently he had been warned by a telephone call from a friend, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunisia, that his life was in danger.  The call, about two weeks before his death, came after the publication of a cartoon attacking a female friend of Mr Yasser Arafat the PLO leader.  "The cartoon was famous in the Arab community".


<h3>Effectiveness & influence</h3>

"When I was younger I thought I would actually be able to help achieve all our aspirations for independence, unity, justice.  Many died for those aspirations and things are only getting worse.  That, certainly, can make one despair.  But more than ever, I feel a sense of duty to go on doing what I have to and can do."

<p>"His cartoons are incredibly effective - and often quite offensive" - quote from a Kuwaiti journalist.

<p>He was posthumously awarded the annual Golden Pen award of the International Federation of Newspaper Publishers (FIEJ) in 1988.  This award is given to recognise outstanding actions in favour of freedom of expression and the jury was composed of publishers from 28 member countries : Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, The Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Great Britain, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States.  Individual publishers in Brazil, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand and Pakistan are associate members as are 13 leading western news agencies.

<h2>Aid that works...</h2>

<i>"The United Kingdom has a highly concessional, business-like bilateral programme largely oriented towards the poorest developing countries. Its role as a major donor has been particularly important in several geographical areas, notably sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, and in key sectors such as education, agricultural research, health and population, and private enterprise. The United Kingdom has many prominent institutions in the development field and an enormous amount of expertise, building on long experience in developing countries."

<h3>A Dramatic Message</h3>
 The Igawilo Clinic is part of the ODA's Health and Nutrition District Support project in Mbeya, Tanzania. It has around 20 full-time members of staff, working in the clinic and outside, serving a community of 20,000 people. It treats over 200 people a day, mostly women and children. In addition to providing immunisation and treating day-to-day ailments, the clinic runs a health education programme. Family planning, sexually transmitted diseases and nutritional issues all feature strongly in monthly awareness campaigns. The health staff convey these messages through a novel medium - a drama group, formed and performed by local people.<p>


Awareness of development and environmental issues at home was given new life this year with the launch in April 1994 of the ODA Roadshow bus - Aid that's really going places.
The bus - donated by Badgerline - has carried the development theme into many schools, town centres and exhibitions throughout Britain and brought the aid message to hundreds of schoolchildren.<p>


Forests in Indonesia will be a little safer thanks to a recent £38 million British aid project there.  Indonesia is home to the world's second largest rainforest. Timber is one of the country's principal export industries and provides livelihoods for hundreds of families. However, the industry requires constant and efficient policing to prevent illegal logging and devastating forest fires. The radio communications project, managed by Philips Communication Systems, has provided the Ministry of Forestry in Jakarta with the means to keep track of illegal activities and maintain contact with its 100 regional offices, 200 branch offices and 600 local centres. Aid for this project was provided under the Aid and Trade Provision which finances projects of industrial and commercial importance to Britain - thus benefiting developing countries directly while helping Britain win contracts abroad. In 1993/94, over £85 million was spent on the ATP.<p>


<b>Lifeline to small business</b><br>
 With the introduction of electricity, stallholders in New Market, Dhaka, Bangladesh, can now stay open all hours. They get their electricity from the Greater Dhaka Power project to which the ODA has given over £63 million. Many other people in the area are also better off now that they have electricity. Growing industries such as garment manufacture, brick-making, printing and steel are benefiting from improved services. And strengthening the cityÕs industry should mean thousands of new jobs and training opportunities, desperately needed in an area where most people live on or below the poverty line.

<h2><br> The Development Education Journal</h2><i>The material that follows has been provided by the </i> <a href="dea_info.html"> Development Education Association</a>

<p>
<h2>Resources from a Southern Perspective</h2>
<p>
<i><b>Peter Fenton</b> works as the Information Resources Worker for the DEA. Here he looks at how resources produced in the South could be used more in Development Education in the UK.</i>
<p>
When you go into a classroom and hear the story of the Ramayana (a Hindu epic) told to the children, you are seeing highly accessible Development Education in practice. But, where is this edition of the Ramayana produced? Is it simply a western interpretation? The work that development education practitioners do in this country relies on information from the 'South' but all too often it is taken from academic books or opinions of western people looking  at the 'South'. We need to look for and read more resources from the 'South', including storybooks, so that we can use resources produced in the South as an integral part of the work we do. 'A freer and fairer information trade may be able to help provide different visions, approaches and representations of the world from a variety of view points', says Jonathan Zeitlyn in an article on Information Trade. He goes further to suggest, 'If trade in information is fairer and comes from the 'South', then learning about development may change to become an easier exchange of ideas and information between the 'South' and the 'North'.' However, how can we start finding out about what resources are available?
<p>
The Information Resources Group recently began an initiative to try and locate businesses in this country that specialise in importing books and other resources. A list (mini directory) of businesses has been collated so that it can be distributed throughout the network. Also, many people are building links with Southern partners who could be a valuable source for materials that are produced in the South.  Organisations such as the Zimbabwe Book Marketing Trust, who organise the Zimbabwe Book Fair in Harare, could also be useful sources of information about resources and where to get hold of them. Developing contacts with overseas partners and asking them to recommend resources produced in their country that could be used by the Development Education network in the UK, would be a good start to encouraging more people to use such resources here. In this way we could try to make the resources we produce available to our Southern partners making the flow of information two-way and also increasing the feedback from the South about what they think of the resources we produce, therefore making our work more accountable.
<p>
There are problems with using Southern-produced materials. As every resource centre is trying to sell their goods to the public, the resources contained must be saleable. Some argue that if materials from the 'South' are not produced with good quality paper, printing, etc., then they cannot be sold in centres here. If this is the case, surely educating our buyers needs to be undertaken. If resources that are from the 'South' are used in teachers' workshops and so on, then our buyers can see the benefits of using Southern-produced materials and therefore not be put off by the reduced quality of the materials. However, care does need to be taken  as impressions about the place where the resources were produced can be given by poor quality materials.
<p>
The resources also need to be accessible. An NGO in Bangladesh runs a school programme and compiled a book written by the children in the schools. The stories are brilliant, showing how children in Bangladesh view their world, be it in a village or in a city. However, if you can't read Bangla then you wouldn't be able to use it. Are there ways in which resources such as these could be adapted for our use? Resources like this are valuable, they should be used and yet it needs a little extra work to make them usable in the UK. As most Development Education practitioners are already excessively overworked, I wonder if this will ever happen.
<p>
But resources needn't be restricted to books or written materials. Artefacts, video, slides, photographs and people are all resource materials. The recent enthusiasm for Southern voices to be used (at last) in Development Education practice is simply a cry to use the most qualified resources when educating about development and the 'South'. As Jaya Graves states, 'Nothing is so moving a testament to a culture, a country, a theme or an issue as a warm-blooded human being whose voice sings of her/his place...' 
<p>
The resources do exist. We need to share the knowledge that we have of how to get hold of them and how to use them, to be able to benefit from them and also to empower the Southern producers to gain access to the market that we have built up.
<p>
If you have any ideas about how to increase the use of resources produced in the South, then contact the Information Resources Group through Peter Fenton at the DEA. If you would like a copy of the Directory of Suppliers of Southern-produced materials then send an A4 SAE to the DEA.

<p>
<i>"My name is Tamsin Lesser. I'm 33 years old and I work in London. I've been sponsoring
children
through
ACTIONAID since 1988 - but my involvement with their sponsor programme goes back to when I
was a
child. I remember my father saying we were going to stop getting a daily newspaper - and
use the
money
we saved to sponsor a little girl in India. She was about the same age as me and it was so
interesting to
enjoy glimpses of life in India through her letters. As soon as I started working, it
seemed natural
to
sponsor a child myself."</i><br>
Tamsin Lesser, ACTIONAID sponsor

<p>Sponsoring a child means everyone in the community benefits from the sponsorship money:

<p><ul><li>90 per cent of your money goes directly to help the people who so badly need
it.

<p><li>You commit yourself to long-term help as the only way to promote real change.

<p><li>You can learn as you give, gaining new insight into the lives and needs of poor
communities in
the
developing world.
</ul>

<p><h3>What sponsorship could mean to a child like Rani </h3>

<p>
Take a walk through the main square in Kuruvikulam and you will begin to understand the
real meaning
of
the word barren. A handful of earth simply crumbles between your fingers.

<p>Yet Kuruvikulam is typical of many small villages in southern India. Year after year of
harsh
droughts
mean that those lucky enough to own any land rarely produce enough to live on.

<p>Life is hard, especially for the children. How can their parents send them to school
when they are
needed to help at home or go to work? The few rupees a child can earn in the fields might
be the only
money a family has.

<p>But there is hope. If you sponsor a child through ACTIONAID we can work with the people
of
Kuruvikulam
and other communities in poor countries. With our help, they could install wells, build
and equip
schools,
train to become healthworkers, and work towards a brighter future.
<img src="22.jpg" align=left hspace=4 vspace=4 width=150 height=209 border=1>
<p>Rani is just eight years old, yet she must rise at 5.00am each morning to fetch water
for her
family.
When she returns she must help her mother cook breakfast, a mixture of plain rice and dhal
-
leftovers of
which will be their evening meal.

<p>Rani's father was killed in an agricultural accident. Her mother works when she can -
but
employment is
scarce, seasonal and unreliable. And so the family depends on the few rupees they earn
each day from
weeding and harvesting for a local farmer.

<p>Luckily, a family in Britain believed that this was no life for an eight year-old
child, and
through
ACTIONAID Rani now has a sponsor.

<p>Thanks to the sponsorship scheme, ACTIONAID has established an education programme in
Kuruvikulam, as well as healthcare and hygiene training. It has also improved the health
of all
children in the
village through a screening and immunisation programme.

<p>Now, Rani has started school and would like to be a teacher herself someday. Rani's
mother,
PushPam,
is also learning to read and write in the afternoons.

<p>Your money can help a child like Rani and a village like Kuruvikulam, secure lasting
improvements
in the
quality of their lives.

<p>In return, you'll receive the satisfaction of knowing your money is well spent.

<p>You will receive regular reports from our fieldworkers and further details about our
work through
our
magazine, Common Cause. You will also receive messages from the child you sponsor and you
can write
too, if you wish. All this makes child sponsorship the most personal way of helping the
poor - as
well as the
most practical.<p>






<p><b>Please sponsor a child today. </b>

CTA - moving with the times</h2>

<p><b>
When the Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation
(CTA) was inaugurated 11 years ago in Ede, Prince Claus of the
Netherlands - who is well-known for his interest in development
issues - attended as guest of honour. On 19 April, he returned
to take part in the official opening of the CTA's new building
in neighbouring Wageningen in the Dutch province of Gelderland.
The siting of the purpose-built premises is significant. The town
of Wageningen has long been an important European centre for agriculture
research and the Dutch, of course, are renowned for their commitment
to cooperation with developing countries.</b> 
<P>
The CTA may only have moved a short distance from its previous
headquarters, but the Centre's 39-strong staff are also aware
of the need to move with the times when it comes to fulfilling
their role in the field of agricultural information. This point
was particularly emphasised by CTA Director, <I>Dr. R.D. Cooke</I>
in his presentation at the opening ceremony. Recalling the Centre's
main tasks (see box) Dr Cooke spoke of the 'changing horizons
and challenges' which they faced, and he focused on four specific
aspects.
<P>
The first of these is the big change taking place in national
agricultural systems, with the state withdrawing more and more
in favour of the private sector and NGOs. This is being accompanied
by a trend towards decentralisation with the result that the CTA
has many more potential partners to cater for and work with.
<P>
Global liberalisation has also had an effect on the kind of information
being sought by the CTA's 'customers'. In the past, demand was
almost exclusively for scientific or technical information, notably
aimed at increasing productivity. Dr Cooke reported that while
this remained important, there was now an increasing interest
in marketing aspects.
<P>
It came as no surprise to hear the Director highlight the challenge
posed by new technologies such as electronic networking and digital
storage. The key point here, he stressed, was to find ways of
adapting these to ACP needs and realities. 'In the next century,'
he argued, 'the <I>haves</I> and the <I>have-nots</I> will be
defined by their access to information.'
<P>
Finally, Dr Cooke referred to the growing significance of regional
linkages. He indicated that the CTA was looking at ways in which
it could help its partners to devise regional development programmes.
<P>
The declaration signalling the official opening of the building
was made in the preceding presentation by <I>E.F.C. Hiehe</I>
who is Deputy Director-General for European Cooperation at the
Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In his speech, Mr Niehe emphasised
the relevance of the CTA, pointing out that while the world food
situation had improved, 'we are now on the threshold of structural
food insecurity'. He also spoke in more general terms about the
future of ACP-EU cooperation and acknowleded that 'partnership,
sovereignty and equality had been somewhat neglected' by donors.
However, he suggested that these concepts were now 'coming back'.
<P>
From the ACP side, the Swaziland ambassador, <I>C.S. Mamba</I>,
who is co-President of the Committee of Ambassadors took up the
theme of food shortages in sub-Saharan Africa and identified some
of the difficulties encountered by African producers, particularly
in respect of new technologies and marketing. He also referred
to the environmental challenges facing ACP countries in the Caribbean
and Pacific. He was keen, however, to stress that the picture
was 'not entirely negative'. Thus, for example, new technologies
and methods had had a positive impact on grain production in Zimbabwe,
horticulture in Kenya, and cocoa and coffee in West Africa. Mr
Mamba echoed Dr Cooke in stressing the advantages of regional
markets, and concluded with a firm statement of support for continuing
ACP-EU cooperation. 'History,' he said, 'will show that the Lom&eacute;
Convention played a central role in the momentum of development.'
<P>
The final speaker was <I>Steffen Smidt</I>, Director-General for
Development at the European Commission, who suggested that the
CTA had played a pioneering role in developing a sectoral approach
at a time when the focus of development cooperation tended to
be on individual projects. 'The Centre', he said, 'has become
a well-respected international institution in the field of agricultural
information.' The Director-General focused on the need for ACP
countries to develop their own capacities and on the gap that
exists 'between potential and reality', because of capacity limitations.
The Centre, he believed, could 'help bridge this gap.' Mr Smidt
also reiterated a point made earlier that the information flow
should not just be in one direction. 'Information from South to
North is vital,' he argued, to ensure better targeting of programmes
in future.
<P>
After the speeches, guests had an opportunity to learn more about
the CTA's activities and to speak to Centre personnel. An exhibition
of the many facilities and services available was mounted in the
headquarters' public areas.

<P>
<B>Lorsqu'un cadre hautement qualifi&#233; quitte son pays, sa
d&#233;cision est motiv&#233;e par des consid&#233;rations d'ordre
politique ou &#233;conomique parfaitement l&#233;gitimes : la paix et la
s&#233;curit&#233; pour lui-m&ecirc;me et sa famille, une satisfaction
professionnelle, de meilleures conditions d'emploi et de
r&#233;mun&#233;ration, un niveau de vie plus &#233;lev&#233;, etc. Depuis
toujours, les pays et les centres acad&#233;miques r&#233;put&#233;s
offrant ces atouts ont accueilli de tr&#232;s nombreux migrants
professionnels, qui ont apport&#233; par la suite une contribution
substantielle non seulement &#224; la croissance &#233;conomique de leur
pays d'accueil mais &#233;galement au progr&#232;s scientifique et
technologique de l'humanit&#233;. On songe imm&#233;diatement, dans ce
contexte, &#224; la vague des scientifiques allemands d&#233;barquant aux
Etats-Unis apr&#232;s la Seconde guerre mondiale ainsi qu'&#224; leurs
d&#233;couvertes et inventions. A l'&#233;chelon plan&#233;taire, la libre
circulation et l'interaction de sp&#233;cialistes hautement comp&#233;tents
apparaissent donc comme un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne positif. Mais le
co&ucirc;t assum&#233; par les pays d'origine de ces sp&#233;cialistes
expatri&#233;s est, en revanche,  incalculable tant en termes
d'opportunit&#233;s de d&#233;veloppement qu'en termes de perte
d'investissements.</b>
<p>
     Si l'Europe a &#233;t&#233; la grande perdante au profit des Etats-Unis
jusqu'aux ann&#233;es 1960, ce sont les pays en d&#233;veloppement qui,
depuis quelques ann&#233;es, fournissent la plus grande partie des
professionnels hautement qualifi&#233;s &#224; l'ensemble du monde industriel.
On compte aujourd'hui plus d'un million et demi de nationaux expatri&#233;s
semi-qualifi&#233;s qui, originaires des pays en d&#233;veloppement, se sont
install&#233;s en Europe occidentale, aux Etats-Unis, au Japon et au Canada. Le
syst&#232;me &#233;ducatif et les instituts de recherche am&#233;ricains sont
largement d&#233;pendants de ces professionnels &#233;migr&#233;s - qui
contribuent ainsi de mani&#232;re non n&#233;gligeable &#224;
l'&#233;largissement du foss&#233; entre les nations riches et les nations pauvres
du monde.
<p>
     L'Afrique, qui conna&icirc;t une forte p&#233;nurie de personnel
qualifi&#233;, en est la principale victime. Ce continent aurait perdu 60.000
sp&#233;cialistes (m&#233;decins, professeurs d'universit&#233;,
ing&#233;nieurs, g&#233;om&#232;tres-experts et autres) entre 1985 et 1990, et
une moyenne de 20.000 chaque ann&#233;e depuis lors.
<p>
     Plus de 21.000 m&#233;decins nig&#233;rians pratiquent aux Etats-Unis
alors que leur propre pays manque cruellement de comp&#233;tences
m&#233;dicales. Selon le rapport 1992 du PNUD sur le D&#233;veloppement
humain, 60 % de l'ensemble des m&#233;decins ghan&#233;ens form&#233;s
dans leur pays natal au cours des ann&#233;es 1980 sont partis ; les chiffres sont
tout aussi &#233;vocateurs en ce qui concerne le Soudan : 17 % des
m&#233;decins et dentistes, 20 % des professeurs d'universit&#233;, 30 % des
ing&#233;nieurs et 45 % des g&#233;om&#232;tres-experts travaillent &#224;
l'&#233;tranger.
<p>
     Bien qu'il soit difficile de calculer le co&ucirc;t d'un professionnel
expatri&#233; en termes de nutrition, de soins de sant&#233; et d'&#233;ducation
fournis par les m&#233;nages et l'Etat, il appara&icirc;t clairement que les pays en
d&#233;veloppement perdent chaque ann&#233;e le fruit d'investissements
colossaux au profit des pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s.
<p>
     Le Service Recherche du Congr&#232;s am&#233;ricain aurait calcul&#233;
en 1971-72 que les Etats-Unis ont gagn&#233; annuellement 20.000 dollars sur
chaque &#233;migr&#233; qualifi&#233; originaire des pays en
d&#233;veloppement. Extrapol&#233;e &#224; l'Afrique, cette estimation prudente
impliquerait une perte sup&#233;rieure &#224; 1,2 milliard de dollars
d'investissements consentis pour la formation des 60.000 sp&#233;cialistes
africains environ qui ont &#233;migr&#233; entre 1985 et 1990. L'estimation
formul&#233;e par la Conf&#233;rence des Nations Unies sur le Commerce et le
D&#233;veloppement (CNUCED) bas&#233;e sur les prix de 1979 est sans doute
beaucoup plus proche de la r&#233;alit&#233; avec une valeur du march&#233;
de 184.000 dollars pour chaque professionnel africain &#233;migr&#233; - en ne
comptant que ceux &#226;g&#233;s de 25 &#224; 35 ans.
<p>
     Les envois de fonds de l'&#233;tranger, en provenance plus
particuli&#232;rement des ressortissants qualifi&#233;s qui gagnent un salaire
&#233;lev&#233;, constituent n&#233;anmoins une source majeure de ressources
pour le d&#233;veloppement de leur pays d'origine. Dans toute l'Afrique, des
familles vivent gr&#226;ce aux envois d'argent des proches travaillant &#224;
l'&#233;tranger tandis que des b&#226;timents sont construits et des projets
&#224; petite &#233;chelle r&#233;alis&#233;s dans les villes et villages
gr&#226;ce &#224; cette m&ecirc;me source. Jamais toutefois cet argent
n'indemnisera l'Afrique de la perte d'investissement subie &#224; cause du "brain
drain".
<p>
<H3>Une carence majeure au niveau de la coop&#233;ration internationale</H3>
<p>
     L'&#233;migration de professionnels hautement qualifi&#233;s des pays en
d&#233;veloppement est un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne extr&ecirc;mement complexe
qui place la communaut&#233; internationale devant plusieurs dilemmes.
Premi&#232;rement, la "fuite des cerveaux" ne peut &ecirc;tre enray&#233;e par
la force ou par la loi : elle proc&#232;de des droits fondamentaux - en
l'occurrence du droit de toute personne de se d&#233;placer d'un pays vers un
autre, m&ecirc;me si l'exercice de ce droit est r&#233;gi par la politique du pays
d'accueil en mati&#232;re d'immigration. Deuxi&#232;mement, il s'agit d'un
probl&#232;me essentiellement national qui ne peut &ecirc;tre r&#233;solu que
par le pays concern&#233; en proposant suffisamment d'incitations pour garder
ses ressortissants qualifi&#233;s. Troisi&#232;mement, l'immigration est rendue
d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment attrayante par certains pays industrialis&#233;s tels
que les Etats-Unis et le Canada. Ainsi donc, si les pays d'Europe, qui appliquent
des politiques d'immigration plus restrictives, comptent un nombre important de
sp&#233;cialistes du tiers monde, leur nombre d&#233;passe le million aux Etats-
Unis comme au Canada. On peut d'ailleurs se demander si, dans ce contexte, la
lib&#233;ralisation du march&#233; international du travail dans le cadre de
l'Organisation mondiale du Commerce servira en d&#233;finitive, comme le
laissent entendre plusieurs pays en d&#233;veloppement, les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts
de l'Afrique.
<p>
     Les causes sous-jacentes au probl&#232;me africain de "fuite des
cerveaux" sont aussi nombreuses qu'&#233;videntes, et d'ordre structurel aussi
bien qu'&#233;conomique. La plus souvent cit&#233;e est le contenu m&ecirc;me
du programme d'enseignement qui, encore inspir&#233; du mod&#232;le des
anciens colonisateurs, aboutit &#224; l'octroi de dipl&ocirc;mes dans des
disciplines sans lien direct, voire sans aucun lien, avec le contexte socio-culturel
et &#233;conomique de l'Afrique. L'argument est discutable au vu du nombre
consid&#233;rable de coop&#233;rants techniques qui travaillent actuellement en
Afrique et qui, form&#233;s par les syst&#232;mes &#233;ducatifs des anciennes
puissances coloniales, contribuent de mani&#232;re positive au
d&#233;veloppement de ce continent. Il reste cependant vrai que les
syst&#232;mes africains d'enseignement sup&#233;rieur ne sont pas outill&#233;s
pour produire des comp&#233;tences adapt&#233;es aux besoins de
d&#233;veloppement de l'Afrique. La p&#233;nurie de mat&#233;riel scientifique
et d'enseignants fait que le syst&#232;me produit une &#233;crasante
majorit&#233; de dipl&ocirc;m&#233;s en art plut&ocirc;t qu'en sciences et en
technologies - domaines qui sont pourtant la cl&#233; de vo&ucirc;te de la
croissance &#233;conomique et du d&#233;veloppement. Il existe donc une
surproduction de dipl&ocirc;m&#233;s dans les disciplines offrant peu de
perspectives d'emploi. Cette situation engendre une migration importante -
paradoxalement parmi les rares scientifiques qui manquent d'un environnement
favorable &#224; leur plein &#233;panouissement professionnel. Des facteurs
aussi &#233;l&#233;mentaires que l'approvisionnement en &#233;lectricit&#233; et
en eau suffisent &#224; provoquer l'&#233;migration. On ne compte plus les
exemples de scientifiques africains frustr&#233;s de voir plusieurs ann&#233;es
de travaux exp&#233;rimentaux an&#233;anties du jour au lendemain par des
ruptures de courant.
<p>
     La faible croissance &#233;conomique de l'Afrique au cours des trente
derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, aggrav&#233;e par des mesures d'ajustement
structurel qui ont fait chuter le niveau de vie et par les troubles au Nigeria et au
Za&iuml;re ou la guerre civile au Liberia, en Sierra Leone et en Somalie, sont
autant de catalyseurs puissants du "brain drain". Des milliers de sp&#233;cialistes
ont &#233;t&#233; contraints &#224; l'exil contre leur gr&#233;, et la plupart de
ceux qui sont rest&#233;s exercent, en ces temps de crise &#233;conomique, de
petits m&#233;tiers non qualifi&#233;s (commer&#231;ants ou chauffeurs de taxi)
sans aucun rapport avec leur formation professionnelle. Il convient de ne pas
sous-estimer la perte d'investissement li&#233;e &#224; cette situation : elle est
&#233;norme - aussi bien pour les familles qui ont fait des sacrifices pendant des
ann&#233;es pour l'&#233;ducation de leurs enfants que pour l'Etat qui a investi
dans le syst&#232;me &#233;ducatif.
<p>
     L'Afrique subsaharienne se trouve actuellement dans une situation
paradoxale avec un nombre &#233;lev&#233; de dipl&ocirc;m&#233;s en
disciplines diverses (m&#233;decine, ing&#233;nierie, architecture,
comptabilit&#233;, etc.) qui &#233;migrent ou sont au ch&ocirc;mage, d'une part,
et une v&#233;ritable arm&#233;e d'assistants techniques &#233;trangers, d'autre
part. L'Afrique a effectivement b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de plus de conseils par
habitant que n'importe quel autre continent. On y trouvait plus de 80.000
coop&#233;rants techniques en 1988, et ils sont plus de 100.000 aujourd'hui. Ces
experts co&ucirc;tent apparemment 4 milliards de dollars par an aux donateurs,
soit pr&#232;s de 35 % du montant total de l'aide publique au
d&#233;veloppement attribu&#233;e &#224; l'Afrique. Cette situation
r&#233;v&#232;le &#224; tout le moins une carence majeure au niveau de la
coop&#233;ration internationale au d&#233;veloppement. Ne serait-il pas plus
efficace et rentable de substituer &#224; ces experts des nationaux africains
expatri&#233;s ayant des liens &#224; la fois culturels et linguistiques avec le
continent ?

<h2>ODA: New aims and priorities<br>Baroness Chalker's speech at Chatham House, 14 February 1996</h2>

</center>

<hr>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

In the mid-nineteenth century Benjamin Disraeli said "change is inevitable. In a progressive country change is constant." It may be regarded as risky for any current Conservative politician to quote the father of 'One Nation' and even riskier for a British politician to describe Britain as progressive! Nevertheless the quote is appropriate and my speech is about change. Changes in the world which create new opportunities and new development priorities; and how in ODA we are meeting these challenges.



<h4>Changes in the World</h4>

When I became Minister for Overseas Development in 1989, the world was a very different place. No one would have predicted then that one of our largest development partners last year would be Russia. If anything the pace of change is accelerating. The very rapid growth rates we have seen in the tiger countries in South East Asia are now spreading wider in the Asia/Pacific region and parts of Latin America. Private flows to developing countries have increased by 50% in the last decade. Britain has played a major part. We are now the third largest supplier of private finance to the developing world. By 2005 the output of traditional developed countries will be exceeded for the first time by the rest of the world.



<h4>Challenges to Donors</h4>

Donors have had to respond. We have done so. The last ten years has already seen more profound changes in our activities and the ways we deliver aid than at any time in our history. Challenges remain: downward pressures on our budgets and on our staff resources. There is scepticism about the value of aid. Finite resources require choices to be made: hard choices. The role of aid should always be subject to regular scrutiny.

<p>



Very different conclusions are drawn. Some argue that private financial flows, not concessional aid, provide the motor for development. Private flows annually are now almost three times higher than development assistance. But these are overwhelmingly directed to a few countries mainly in the East. Private flows to Africa have declined over the past decade. Domestic savings and private flows are simply insufficient to finance basic development needs in the poorer countries.

<p>



So concessional assistance is still needed: that special development assistance which will support and enhance the efforts made by developing countries themselves. The importance of the private sector is undeniable. This message came over loud and clear at the recent SADC Conference on trade and investment which I attended; and which, for the first time, included private sector participants. But concerns about possible negative consequences of government to government aid are greatly overstated.

<p>



Aid does assist reforms, but the changes in institutional practice are frequently slow, requiring extensive training and capacity building. So delivering improvement does not happen in a month, but gradually year by year.

<p>



Aid donors have changed; we have learnt from past successes and failures. We have learnt that good projects can be undermined by a poor policy framework. Thus encouraging political and economic reform has become one of our top priorities. We know we must take account of social and environmental concerns. We realise that building human and institutional capacity is vital. It also requires a great deal of political confidence building to enable Ministers to continue reforms in the difficult but inevitable troughs. Increasing emphasis on help for the poorest - poor countries as well as the poor people - also makes reform more acceptable.

<p>



Recent academic work by Professor Mosley of Reading University concludes that aid has become more effective over time. It shows a positive impact on growth of exports and on investment. The impact has been particularly significant for those countries implementing successfully programmes of adjustment.

<p>



Of course we need to be realistic. There will not be a dramatic rise in development assistance in the short term, whoever wins the next election, as those of you who followed the recent debates on ODA in both Houses of Parliament will know. There will also be setbacks in developing countries, where the commitment to reform is not yet universal. Our job is to continue our efforts to improve aid quality and impact. I welcome the plaudits in Parliament, from the OECD, and from our developing country partners for the work of the ODA. I am determined that we become even more effective. Let me say how we seek to do so.



<h4>ODA</h4>

The ODA undertook recently a <a href="expend.htm">Fundamental Expenditure Review</a>. Its findings are worth noting.

<p>



It concluded that development assistance has, by and large, been effective and that there is a continuing need for Britain to provide concessional aid. It reaffirmed both the moral argument for this country being involved in the development effort, and that of enlightened self-interest. The Government agrees.

<p>



It recommended that responsibility for both bilateral and multilateral aid should remain in the ODA. We agree. It is one of Britain's main strengths as an aid donor, and the envy of many other donor countries.

<p>



The FER recommended that we should define better our basic purpose and the aims that serve that purpose. We have done. I have agreed a new Mission Statement; copies are available in this room.

<p>



Our purpose is stated clearly. That is: to improve the quality of life for people in poorer countries by contributing to sustainable development and reducing poverty and suffering. It is important to note that all our work will be directed to meeting this overarching purpose of poverty reduction and sustainable development. To focus our efforts to this end we will pursue four key aims. All are fundamental to our work. They are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. I will say more about each of them in a few minutes.

<h4>Concentration</h4>



But before doing so I want to touch on one recommendation in the FER which has caught public attention. That is, that ODA's resources should be concentrated on a limited number of countries in order to enhance impact. In principle, I agree. We are working in more countries and undertaking more complex activities than ever before. Concentrating our regular bilateral country programmes on fewer recipients will improve the quality and impact of our aid, and maximise our influence. Other countries will continue to benefit from British Partnership Schemes, the Heads of Mission schemes and smaller scale projects often provided with local NGOs.

<p>



However this is not a dramatic change; but rather continuation of a gradual process already under way. For example, last year some 69% of bilateral resources went to the twenty largest recipients. More of our aid will be directed to the poorer countries in Africa and Asia. No specific target will be created for a set list of 20Êcountries. The largest recipients may vary from year to year. The task is to ensure that the poorest countries get the greatest concentration of effective help. They will of course need to continue to show they can use aid effectively. So aid will go to those who need it most, and can make best use of it. Our task has always been to help people to improve their own lives. By concentrating our efforts, we can give greater assistance and enable better progress.

<p>



There is no question of abandoning countries where our support is still needed. Development assistance is part of our broader foreign policy interests. There is still much to be done, for example, to assist countries in transition in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and smaller countries elsewhere which depend on concessional aid. We will maintain worthwhile development relationships through Heads of Mission Schemes, the very substantial contributions we give through multilateral channels, and through other non-country bilateral programmes, including research, scholarships, volunteer and NGO projects. Some countries will graduate from concessional aid when conditions are right, just as South Korea and Singapore did in the past.



<h4>The 4 aims</h4>

Let me return to the Mission Statement. The purpose is our raison d'etre, that is what we are determined to achieve. The four aims focus the ODA's work. The aims are means by which we expect ODA's purpose to be achieved; they are not ends in themselves. They strengthen our integrated and interdisciplinary approach to operations. I have designated four senior ODA officials as Aim Directors to promote the aims. Their tasks as Aim Directors are additional to their other roles. Additional posts are not being created. Advisers in London and overseas will work collectively to achieve the four aims.

<p>



The Aims will not be allocated specific sums of money. Bilateral expenditure programmes will continue to be managed on a country basis.  We will also continue to finance technology, development and research programmes.

<p>



These are designed to meet the developing countries' needs, but undertaken mainly by British institutions. We are asking the Aim Directors to improve the quality and impact of our programmes. Together with Chief Advisers, Aim Directors will be a conduit to those outside ODA including the multilateral organisations. They will explain how we are pursuing our aims, and monitor success. They will also be a further channel for informed debate. We want ODA planning to benefit from the ideas and expertise of the wider development community in Britain.

< p>



Our first Aim is to encourage sound development policies, efficient markets and good government. This continues work underway for some time. It does not mean simply following World Bank and IMF prescriptions. We have been supporting economic reform and liberalisation for many years. Sound policy and economic reform are essential conditions for growth. We have made a major contribution to joint efforts to improve the quality of public expenditure, and thereby to improve the quality of services provided to poorer people.  In many countries we have promoted the removal of barriers to trade, improved the environment for domestic and foreign investment, helped governments to stabilise public finance and to bring inflation under control. We have promoted democratic government and directly assisted free and fair elections in countries such as South Africa, Zambia and Malawi. In Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, much of the work of the Know How Fund has been designed to support economic and political reform in the special circumstances of the post-Communist transition. We have given strong support to the development of small enterprise, creating income-generating opportunities.

<p>



The changes ODA is making will sharpen the thrust of these activities.  They will enable us to transfer our experience between countries and to the multilateral organisations in a more effective manner. We shall continue to offer advice and experience. For instance, we pass on if appropriate the lessons we have learnt from UK privatisation because they have relevance elsewhere. Many countries want to expand competition, improve efficiency and reduce state controls. Many countries also need to make their governments and public administrations more effective while reducing their role in their national affairs. Britain has good experience to offer in this field. Our experience in strengthening institutions in many fields is highly relevant and much sought after. The operation of labour markets, and the links between emergencies and development need to be better understood. The Aim Director will help draw these threads together, and so promote better cross-fertilisation.



<h4>2nd aim</h4>

Our second aim is to help people achieve better education and health and to widen opportunities - especially for women. The Aim Director will seek to ensure that all our human development work is focused directly on the needs of people, and leads to real benefits. For example our approach to Children by Choice not Chance, through better access to reproductive health care, has gained widespread international acceptance as the right way forward in population activities. Again this is a means to an end.

<p>



What matters most is the evidence that British aid has helped hundreds of millions of women and men to access contraceptive services, treatment for sexually transmitted infection and maternal health care. Their quality of life has improved. Positive results have been reported by ODA-funded British researchers in the field of reproductive health, malaria and emergency aid. We want better feed back on the impact of our work in other areas: for example on peoples' health; on the reduction of communicable diseases; on rates of survival in refugee camps and disaster zones; on the proportion of girls who can read or write; on access to new opportunities for employment.

<p>

               

Our third aim - enhancing productive capacity and conserving the environment - will improve performance in increasing and sustaining production, reducing pollution and waste and maintaining the quality of the environment.

<p>



This builds on a range of ODA activities from the promotion of cleaner technologies and energy efficiency, better use of water resources, food products and the sustainable management of forests. It captures global as well as national concerns. Many people in developing countries depend heavily on agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Our challenge is to help them meet their needs to improve their lives, without degrading the environment. Of course there will be conflicts of interest. Through our integrated approach we can try to resolve these issues in partnership, to apply more widely the lessons of experience, and promote best practice.

<p>



As I have indicated these three aims are cross-cutting and mutually supportive. The aims will help to sharpen our focus, to promote dialogue with our development partners. Pursuit of the aims contributes to our overall, but central purpose. Each bilateral country programme will address several aims. Individual projects may do likewise. They apply to all our programmes, multilateral as well as bilateral.



<h4>4th aim</h4>

This brings me to our final aim: to promote international policies for sustainable development and enhance the effectiveness of multilateral development institutions. Our bilateral programme and our multilateral contributions share a common purpose. Multilateral aid now accounts for over half our total expenditure. We must therefore pursue our aims through the operations of multilateral bodies. With the respective management and other donors we want to improve the effectiveness with which they conduct their business.  This applies across the board; and we are building on this within ODA by closer links between our bilateral managers and the multilateral side. For example, the senior staff managing our bilateral country programmes will in future be directly responsible for ODA's role in agreeing the EC's country aid strategies and decisions on individual spending commitments. It will be their task to scrutinise EC proposals and to represent the ODA's views at management committee meetings when spending decisions are made.

<p>



However, development is about more than the effective use of resources. Sustainable development, a reduction in poverty and an improvement in the quality of life of people in developing countries will need more international trade and international investment. The debt burden must be reduced for the most vulnerable poor countries. Other international or regional matters such as migration are significant influences on development progress. ODA has expertise in these fields. We will ensure it is brought to bear more strongly on this broader development agenda in Whitehall, the European Union, the United Nations and the International Financial Institutions. The interests of major aid recipients should be fully reflected in wider economic policy discussions. With the further changes we are making the ODA, as it stands, is equipped for this task.



<h4>PES/resources</h4>

Our basic purpose is ambitious. I make no excuse for that. Of course it must be seen against a background of resource constraints. Every government has to balance the many and growing public expenditure priorities and demands. The goal is a more prosperous Britain in a more peaceful and prosperous world.  Developing countries need Britain's substantial and effective aid programme.  Just as valuable is a stronger British economy and the contribution it makes to a more prosperous world.

<p>



The aid budget, like budgets across Whitehall, cannot be immune from the overriding need for the Government to balance its books.  Of course, I was more than disappointed in November that the aid budget was reduced when compared with our previous published plans.  So we have protected the bilateral allocations.  Next year bilateral aid plans will be much as before. As the PrimeÊMinister said after the Cannes European Council last year, the Government will ensure that multilateral contributions do not swallow up our bilateral aid. A substantial and effective bilateral aid programme must remain one of the key elements in Britain's relationship with the developing world. My aim is to ensure the right balance between our bilateral and multilateral commitments, to see that both contribute to our purpose.

<p>



In retrospect this speech might have been better titled: "Change and Continuity". Britain has the fifth largest aid programme in absolute terms. We can continue to be proud of this very substantial help. We have one of the best programmes in the world. We have responded quickly and effectively to changes, building on the success and strengths of our existing programmes. We are making a real difference to the lives of people poorer than our own. We want to do even better. That is the responsibility that everyone in ODA has. It is my task as Minister to ensure everyone is working to achieve our stated purpose: to improve the quality of life for people in poorest countries by contributing to sustainable development and by reducing poverty and suffering.

<h2 align=center>SUMMARY



REPORT</h2>









<h4 align=center>July 1995</h4>

<hr>

<h2>FOCUSING ON QUALITY</h2>



1.	The detailed terms of reference for this Fundamental Expenditure Review (FER or review) are annexed.  The thrust of the task we have been set by Ministers is to improve the effectiveness of the Overseas Development Administration (ODA).  The review has therefore sought to deliver gains in efficiency and effectiveness (rather than a pre-determined reduction in resources) by examining systems and policies so as to improve the quality of our work.  In doing so, it has taken account of the wider policy context and central Government initiatives within which ODA has to operate.  The Senior Management Review has also begun and will take account of the conclusions of the FER.



<h2>STARTING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH</h2>



2.	The picture revealed by widespread consultation with ODA's customers and staff is of an effective organisation with dedicated and professional staff.  Many of our interlocutors - the British development community, other Government departments with which we interact closely and those who receive our aid - rated ODA highly.  But in any organisation there is always room for improvement in the way things are done - even in one like ODA which has reviewed large areas of its operations over recent years.



<h2>THE BENEFITS OF CONSULTATION</h2>



3.	The approach to the FER has been open and consultative.  Many innovative ideas for improving the ODA were offered by ODA staff and outsiders.  Benchmarking against other donors and taking on board the views of aid recipient countries have been important features of the review.  And we have been greatly helped by the work of 24 project teams, which have produced analyses and recommendations that, by and large, we support and have included in the final report.  This summary report includes only the most important of those recommendations.



<h2>THE FER AGENDA</h2>



4.	The review focused on:

<p>



	<ul><li>	defining ODA's fundamental role;

<p>



	<li>	examining ODA's purpose, aims and objectives;

<p>



	<li>	considering changes to systems and organisation structure which might help ODA to measure more clearly (and improve) its performance against the aims and objectives;  

<p>



	<li>	considering strategic and management choices in bilateral and multilateral aid with a view to enhancing ODA's effectiveness, including through the redeployment of resources within the aid programme;  and

<p>



	<li>	outlining new techniques which could be used to make us more efficient.

</ul><p>



5.	Our conclusions will need to be taken forward and developed in detail before they can be fully implemented.  We saw the essence of our task as defining the agenda for change at the broadest level and outlining a system for tackling it in the coming years.  Some of our conclusions will need to be tested on the ground.



<h2>ODA's ROLE:  SOME PRIOR QUESTIONS</h2>



6.	In examining ODA's fundamental role, we answered a number of prior questions as follows:-



	<ul><li>	The process of development can be defined as meaning a sustainable improvement in the quality of life and reduced poverty.

	<li>	Developed countries support the sustainable development process out of a sense of moral obligation (e.g. to reduce poverty) and in the pursuit of national interests (e.g. by extending liberal trade and financial regimes, by helping to prevent a relapse into the Cold War, and by seeking political or commercial advantage).  There is no intrinsic conflict between the two motivations.  But the balance between them will differ according to the developed country, the historical period, and the region of the world under discussion.

<p>



<li>	The key development challenges are to bring about market-based economic growth, better government, higher quality social and direct poverty reduction programmes, and environmental sustainability.

<p>



	<li>	A number of instruments other than aid are available to tackle these challenges:  progress is primarily dependent on the efforts and policies of the poorer countries themselves, but it is also dependent on private investment flows, greater trade access to developed country markets and debt relief.  The UK Government (HMG) has a good record of advocating freer trade and debt relief for the poorest states, as well as stressing the importance of conflict prevention in creating conditions conducive to development.

<p>



	<li>	Aid - the transfer of finance or know-how at below market terms - has however an important complementary role in relation to the other instruments for supporting development.  Aid used effectively, particularly through its influence on developing countries' policies, can ensure that the non-aid instruments are more powerful in their effect.  In performing this function, aid should be seen as a temporary instrument focused on those poor countries least able to meet their development needs through trade, private flows and domestic resources.

<p>

    

	<li>	Aid is a collective effort.  While there are elements of competition between donor countries (for influence or for commercial advantage), there is general agreement on the key development challenges.  There is much interaction and coordination between members of the donor community and also with recipients.  The major donors seek to influence the policies and approaches of each other, of the aid recipient countries and of the wider development community.

<p>



	<li>	And aid has, by and large, been effective.  There are certainly examples where aid has enabled countries to maintain inappropriate government structures, where adjustment programmes have been poorly designed or where projects have been financed with inadequate attention to social or environmental concerns.  But, taken in aggregate, the evidence strongly suggests that aid is effective provided it does not displace other flows, is planned with social and institutional factors taken into account and involves the intended beneficiaries in project design and implementation, and is - crucially -delivered within a sound policy framework in the recipient country.  The role of the IMF and the World Bank has been central to the process of policy dialogue.

</ul>

<h2>ODA's ROLE:  FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS</h2>



7.	Taking account of the above, we reached the following conclusions on the fundamental questions about ODA's role:-



	<ul><li>	HMG's aid programme is motivated by both a sense of moral obligation and the pursuit of national interests.  The moral case in particular supports emergency aid and assistance to the poorest countries.  The UK national interest case is particularly strong for providing aid to certain middle-income countries and to the larger poor countries with the greatest long-term potential.  



	<p>

<li>	As some of these objectives are not specific to the UK and as aid is a collective effort, it might be argued that HMG should act as a "free rider" and provide no overseas assistance at all.  However, there is a broad political consensus in the UK that the Government should provide aid.  Neither the moral obligation to help nor the need to protect and enhance national interests would be served by HMG pulling out of aid.  Indeed, to the extent that aid is an important lever for HMG in influencing the debate, as a member of the Group of 7 and a Permanent Member of the Security Council, on the wider interests of the developed world, an end to UK assistance would be harmful to British interests.  



<h4>We recommend therefore that HMG should continue to provide concessional aid.</h4>





	<p>

<li>	It is not possible to establish a "right" level for the Aid Budget.  It is, however, questionable whether the present level is high enough to fulfil the Government's wish to maintain the share of aid going through bilateral channels and to continue to be seen to shoulder Britain's share of the global burden.  The inescapable and rising sums of aid passing through the EC budget are putting pressure on the level of bilateral aid to a degree that has no parallel in any other donor country.  



	<p>

<li>	ODA is unlike many other official aid organisations in that the Aid Budget covers funds spent through both bilateral and multilateral channels.  Combining responsibility for both bilateral and multilateral aid, policy formulation and implementation is perceived by HMG, some other donors, the wider UK development community and by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) as one of the UK aid programme's key strengths.  It avoids the duplication, institutional rivalry and lack of policy focus and consistency which characterises the programmes of some other donors.  It gives UK development assistance a coherence that facilitates ODA's advocacy role, particularly in multilateral fora.  

<h4>We recommend that ODA should retain responsibility for both bilateral and multilateral aid.</h4>





	<li>	In delivering British bilateral aid and through its role in influencing multilateral institutions, ODA has built up expertise on a wide range of development issues, including the use of non-aid instruments.  ODA therefore has the capacity and contacts to be influential on non-aid issues (such as trade, investment, debt relief, and technology transfer) concerning the UK's broader economic and financial relations with developing and transition countries.  But, with the exception of its input into the global environment debate, ODA has rarely engaged pro-actively in the broader issues in recent years.  It also has the knowledge to help enhance the UK effort in the range of international institutions which deal with these broader issues.  HMG's influence on the international economic system as a whole is likely to be much greater if ODA adopts this wider role.



<h4>We recommend that the ODA input in broader development policy debates become more pro-active and substantive (and hence influential) than at present.  Mechanisms to achieve this will require further study, but should include the adoption of this wider agenda as one of ODA's aims (see below).</h4>

</ul>



<h2>ODA's GOAL, PURPOSE AND AIMS</h2>



8.	Central to the FER was the analysis of what ODA should be trying to achieve as enshrined in the purpose and aims of the organisation set out in its mission statement.  We came to the following conclusions:-



	<ul><li>	ODA's remit, as the institution delivering British official aid and (potentially) as a more pro-active influence on broader development issues, forms part of the international development effort.  Therefore, ODA's goal can be defined at the broadest level as the improvement in the quality of life and reduced poverty and suffering (in countries that require concessional finance).  To reach this goal, ODA's purpose must be the promotion of sustainable development.  



	<p>

<li>	ODA's mission statement contains three statements which could be construed as covering both its goal and its purpose.  All of these are consistent with each other and with the definition of goal and purpose above.  But retaining all three in the mission statement and without distinguishing more clearly between them risks making unclear ODA's goal and purpose.  



<h4>We recommend that ODA clarify its goal and purpose as follows:  

<p>



"ODA's goal is to improve the quality of life and reduce poverty and suffering in poorer countries";

<p>



"ODA's purpose is to promote sustainable development".</h4>





This goal and purpose are consistent with the aims of HMG's foreign policy and with those of other Government Departments concerned with international economic affairs.



	<p>

<li>	ODA currently has seven priority objectives.  Each of these has a "monitor" within ODA, responsible for reporting biennially on progress against the priority objectives.  The priority objectives have been valuable in external presentation of the aid programme and have had some effect on the nature of ODA's activities.



	<p>

  <li>	Many of the priority objectives are overlapping and cross-cutting in that any one of ODA's activities will meet a number of them.  They are also open-ended in that they describe goals which can never be finally achieved.  Their very nature means that they are not easily amenable to weighting, to directing the allocation of resources, and to vesting responsibility for them in individuals.  In essence, they are more like "aims" (descriptions of the direction in which ODA wishes to travel) than "objectives" (targets that are capable of being measured and achieved).  Indicators of achievement of these aims can only be defined at a less aggregated level related to the widely varying contexts (e.g. country and institutional) in which we work.



	<p>

<li>	Therefore, the essential purpose of high-level aims should be to define the model of development that Ministers believe should provide the framework for ODA's activities.  Over recent years, HMG has stressed the aid programme's role in tackling the following broad inter-disciplinary issues:



		<ul><li>	the need for appropriate policies, efficient markets, effective institutions and good government to support development;



		<p>

<li>	the quality and quantity of investment in the social sectors and the need for attention to widening choices and opportunities, in particular by enhancing the status of women; and



		<p>

<li>	the need to ensure the gap between existing capacity and the long-term productive potential of poor countries is being closed through investments that are sustainable.



	</ul><p>

<li>	On this basis, it would be plausible for ODA to adopt three high-level aims:



	<ul><li>	one aim to focus on the policy environment for development by linking together the existing economic reform and good government priority objectives as is increasingly the case in the design of ODA activities, e.g. balance of payments support in Africa;



		<p>

<li>	a second aim to cover the development of human resources:  this would encompass the existing human development and status of women priority objectives in recognition of the close connections between education, health and population, and gender issues in much of ODA's work.  It would also be feasible to capture ODA's emergency aid work under this aim; and



		<p>

<li>	a third aim to focus on enhancing productive capacity and conservation of the environment, which would encompass the existing priority objective of the same title, which already includes ODA activities in a wide range of productive sectors, from agriculture to infrastructure, and much of the work under the existing environment objective.

</ul>

Both the existing direct poverty reduction and environment priority objectives are also captured - the latter implicitly - in the proposed statement of goal and purpose.  Direct poverty reduction should also feature as a focus for some of ODA's activities under any one of the revised aims.  



	<p>

<li>	These three aims cover activities directed to helping developing and transition countries achieve sustainable development by way of their internal policies and ODA-funded aid activities.  They do not capture the adoption of a wider role by ODA - recommended earlier - in influencing international economic systems and policies which affect these countries.  Nor do they bring out ODA's role in influencing multilateral institutions (and their member governments) that are relevant to sustainable development.  A fourth aim is required to cover this broader role.   



	<p>

<li>	Figure 1 below sets out the relationship between the recommended goal, purpose and aims.  It spells out the links between ODA's existing priority objectives and three of the four proposed aims.  









<h4>We recommend that ODA formally adopt four "aims":



-	to encourage sound development policies, efficient markets and good government;



-	to help people achieve better education, health and opportunity, particularly for women;



-	to enhance productive capacity and to conserve the environment; and



-	to promote international policies for sustainable development and to enhance the effectiveness of multilateral institutions.</h4>





	<p>

<li>	The existing priority objectives should henceforth be seen as more detailed perspectives on the first three proposed aims.  Financial input information on the existing priority objectives should continue therefore to be collected.  But the term "priority objectives" should be dropped in order to avoid confusion with the aims and lower-level operational objectives.  Financial input information should also be collected in relation to the fourth proposed aim.



<p>

<li>	These conclusions on ODA's goal, purpose and aims will require revision of the mission statement.  To understand how ODA's mission will be carried out, it is important to place it within the context of the organisation's culture and values.  ODA's values need to be agreed across the organisation.  



<h4>We recommend a revised mission statement on the lines of the preliminary draft in the box below be adopted.  There should be wide consultation within ODA on the inclusion of a list of values in the mission statement.  Further consideration should also be given to the best means for disseminating a revised mission statement internally and externally.</h4>



</ul>



<h2>PRELIMINARY DRAFT OF A NEW MISSION STATEMENT FOR ODA

</h2>

ODA's goal is to improve the quality of life and reduce poverty and suffering in poorer countries.

<p>



ODA's purpose is to promote sustainable development.

<p>



To achieve this, ODA's aims are:



<ul><li>to encourage sound development policies, efficient markets and good government;



<li>to help people achieve better education, health and opportunity, particularly for women; 



<li>to enhance productive capacity and to conserve the environment; and



<li>to promote international policies for sustainable development and to enhance the effectiveness of multilateral institutions.



<b>[To be added ... the core values which help make progress towards the aims]</b>



</ul>

<h2>ACHIEVING GREATER FOCUS ON ODA'S AIMS</h2>



9.	An organisation's overall performance should be judged in terms of its aims.  All organisations therefore strive to focus their effort on their aims.  ODA is no different, but we believe it could do more in this regard in terms of its organisation and strategic planning systems as set out below:-



<ul><li>Operational objectives are currently set and performance measured at many different levels.  There are objectives for staff, for departments and divisions.  There are also objectives for discrete aid activities (e.g. projects) and, above these, at the programme strategy level (e.g. for country, sector and research strategies).  Above this are ODA's aims (the term used henceforth to cover the existing priority objectives as well).  Performance is assessed at all these levels but aggregate measures that capture ODA's unique contribution become more difficult to define as one goes up the hierarchy.



	<p>

<li>	An elaborate system exists for measuring and monitoring performance within country programmes as shown in Figure 2 below.  The outcome of this process is used to compile the biennial progress report by the monitors of ODA's aims.  The first progress report was published recently and is recognised by ODA to be short of detail on the measurement of current impact and effectiveness with regard to the aims.  To this end, we endorse the actions ODA have in hand to improve the measurement of inputs, implementation effectiveness and impact.



	<p>

<li>	The progress report is compiled by monitors of the aims.  The monitors report on performance against the aims and may advocate more activity in their particular area;  but they have no clear role in decisions on the allocation of resources.



	<p>

<li>	To improve focus on the aims, a more active role by senior managers tasked to "promote" the aims is required.  This role would be facilitated by a reduction in the number of aims and an increase in the overall seniority of the managers concerned.  The latter would be responsible for stimulating new thinking and inter-disciplinary approaches required to achieve the aims.  This may be advanced more rapidly by a different organisation of ODA's professional advisers around the first three proposed aims.  The proposed fourth aim is covered by existing mechanisms. 

  

	<p>

<li>	Allocating ODA's resources by aim rather than by the current mix of bilateral country and non-country programmes and multilateral channels was also considered but rejected.  ODA's task is to match its aims with the development priorities of the recipients of British aid rather than force the latter into a strait-jacket.  The "top-down" emphasis on the aims and the "bottom-up" approach to planning aid activities should meet at the level of designing strategies for broad areas of ODA's work (e.g. country programmes).  Nevertheless, to achieve a stronger focus on the aims, the senior managers acting as their promoters would need to play a stronger role in the process of resource allocation.



<h4>We recommend that the proposed aims should have "promoters", senior managers who would combine monitoring, advocacy and resource allocation responsibilities.  They would replace the current monitors.  We also recommend that the ODA should consider organising its professional staff around the first three proposed aims.  Mechanisms exist for focusing on the proposed fourth aim, but ODA should consider how to strengthen them.</h4>





<h4>We also recommend ODA should continue to publish a progress report on performance against its aims.  Given the lengthy gestation of aid activity, this should be every three years (rather than two as at present), with the next progress report due in 1998.  </h4>



	

<li>	ODA operates a number of strategic planning cycles.  All the elements of a strategic planning process are in place.  But the elements should be linked more coherently and be designed to help ODA focus more on its aims. 



<h4>We recommend ODA develop a system that unifies its various strategic planning cycles into one which clearly links all the elements from discrete activities through business-level to corporate-level strategy.  The lynchpins of a unified process should be an annual ODA Corporate Strategy Paper and Business Plans.  The Corporate Strategy Paper would be produced by the centre in February on the basis of Business Plans drafted in September and finalised in February.  These documents would report on past performance as well as outlining objectives and resources required for the coming three financial years.</h4>





		Figure 3 below sets out the recommended unified strategic planning cycle.



	<p>

<li>	Business Plans would be drafted either at the divisional command level or, where aggregation of objectives at that level is inappropriate, at departmental level.  They would be based on the Personal Responsibility Plans of Under Secretaries and Chief Advisers, annual staff reports, departmental objectives, and various programme strategy papers, all of which would have to be completed or updated in the period between March and July.  Business Plans would need to cover:



		<ul><li>	performance against existing detailed objectives that are linked to ODA's aims;



		<p>

<li>	the detailed objectives and performance measures (linked to the aims) for the next three financial years;  and



		<p>

<li>	the programme and running costs budgets available and required to deliver the forward objectives.

</ul><p>



<li>	Business Plans would replace bids for programme resources.  The "Resource Allocation Round" (combining programme and running cost resources) would involve negotiations around Business Plans.  Over time, the use of Business Plans which link operational-level objectives to ODA's aims should provide useful information on whether a particular planned resource allocation pattern is more likely than another to maximise the organisation's contribution to the promotion of sustainable development.



	<p>

<li>	Once the Resource Allocation Round has been completed, Business Plans would need to be finalised alongside an ODA Corporate Strategy Paper which would be based on them.  The latter would replace a number of existing aid and management strategy papers (e.g. Aid Strategy Paper and Strategic Management Plan), but include the Efficiency Plan and the planned allocation of resources as annexes.  It would thereby aim to bring together the consideration of policies, programmes and management resources.  The Corporate Strategy Paper would cover:



		<ul><li>	reports of performance against objectives in the Business Plans;

		<li>	the priorities for the next three financial years (detailed for year 1, less so for the outer years);



		<li>	details of the objectives set out in Business Plans for the year ahead, including performance measures;  and



		<li>	the volume of programme and running cost resources to be deployed to deliver the forward objectives.



</ul><p>

The Corporate Strategy Paper would then be reflected in the Departmental Report published in March and feed back into the strategy papers, departmental objectives and PRPs for the following year.



	<p>

 <li>	The Corporate Strategy Paper would also provide much of the material for the progress report on performance against the aims.  It would therefore allow ODA to assess - either annually or at a minimum of every three years - whether ODA's purpose and aims remain appropriate.



	 <p>

<li>	Such a system needs to be tested to ensure that it is robust across all of ODA's commands and departments.  Among the primary requirements will be the development of a better central management information system related to Business Plan objectives and performance indicators.   ODA's Evaluation Department, with the help of the "promoters" of the aims, should become the experts on performance measurement for the organisation as a whole.



<h4>We therefore recommend piloting Business Plans in International Division and in a geographical, an advisory and a central command between now and February 1997.  The centre should attempt a mock-up of a Corporate Strategy Paper in February 1996.  Full implementation of the unified strategic planning system should be considered in early 1997 on the basis of the pilot.</h4>





	<li>	The pilot exercise will help generally to define a single purpose, objectives and performance measures for each Business Plan.  It will be important to include the senior managers promoting the aims, and Evaluation Department, in this exercise, and to ensure clear linkage between the aims and the Business Plans.  Responsibility for performance against the purpose and objectives in each Business Plan should also be made clear.  



<h4>We recommend each Business Plan should define a single purpose and a number of supporting objectives linked to the aims.  Given that the Business Plan would be the property of the highest management level at which aggregation in objective-setting and performance measurement is feasible, the sum of their purposes would equate to ODA's contribution to its purpose of promoting sustainable development.  Named senior managers should be responsible for the objectives of Business Plans.</h4>

</ul>



<h2>STRATEGIC CHOICES AND IMPROVING QUALITY IN COUNTRY PROGRAMMES</h2>



10.	We also considered other ways of enhancing ODA's performance.  In terms of country programmes, we reached the following conclusions:-



	<ul><li>	Compared with a few years ago, ODA is working in more countries  and undertaking more complex activities, while the resources available for such programmes have been shrinking and are expected to continue to decline.  Given this picture, it is hard to believe that ODA is, or can remain, a serious player in so many countries in terms of achieving developmental impact and enhancing UK influence.  A private firm in a similar position would react by focusing its efforts even more rapidly on its most profitable programmes.



<p>

<li>	Some progress has been made in increasing concentration.  The largest 20 recipients accounted for 69% of planned country programme expenditure in 1994/95, compared with 62% in 1989/90.  Under current plans, they will account for 73% of country programme expenditure in 1997/98.  This has been achieved in part by increasing the number of country programmes limited to small "British Partnership Schemes" (BPS) run by Heads of Mission, which maintain a visible UK aid relationship at low cost.



	<p>

<li>	The key decision criteria for achieving further concentration should be the relative need for aid, ODA's effectiveness (sufficient UK capacity to deliver development impact and influence others in the development community), and British national interest.  These criteria are reflected in the Resource Allocation Round.



	<p>

<li>	In terms of need, the development indicators are worst for sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.  These regions have lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, lower access to primary education and higher adult illiteracy rates than others.



<p>	<li>

	As for implementation effectiveness, analyses completed in the 18 months to November 1994 suggest that 78% of projects in value terms are being satisfactorily or very satisfactorily implemented.  This compares to a figure of 63% as reported in the 1994 Departmental Report for projects completed in the previous period.  While differences between regions are not vast, the evidence suggests - not surprisingly - that project implementation is easier in higher-income regions.  



	 <p>

<li>	ODA's evaluation studies give some indication of development impact but this evidence needs to be approached with considerable caution:  it is based on a very small, non-random and time-bound sample and cannot therefore be taken as truly representative of the long-term effectiveness of country programmes as a whole.  Nevertheless, both in terms of the number of projects and their value, success ratings from these studies suggest a decline in the development impact of country programmes.  This is explained by ODA attempting to undertake more difficult projects in recent years, e.g. focused on institutional strengthening, most particularly in Africa.  (There are comparable indicators for other major aid donors to Africa, e.g. the World Bank, over this period.)  This apparent decline in portfolio quality should be corrected over time provided African governments adhere to strong economic reform programmes.



	<p>

<li>	In terms of wielding influence through the country programmes, ODA is relatively stronger in Africa and South Asia.  In Africa, in particular, ODA is perceived by recipient governments, other donors and the NGOs as a key player.  The best example of this influence is probably the Special Programme of Assistance for sub-Saharan Africa (SPA), under which the ODA has succeeded in pushing the donor agenda forward on foreign exchange liberalisation, the social dimensions of adjustment, public expenditure management and the concept of budgetary support.



	<p>

<li>	The analysis of need and effectiveness suggest that ODA's country programmes should focus in future even more on sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.  And, given the historical significance of the changes in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (CEE/FSU), there are arguments for ODA's continued involvement in the region, albeit for a limited period and with the balance of effort shifting away from the relatively advanced Visegrad 4.  



<h4>We therefore recommend ODA should evolve graduation strategies for its bilateral country programme spending in south-east Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean (including Dependent Territories), the Pacific and the more advanced CEE/FSU countries with a view to achieving a target concentration ratio (e.g. 85% of planned country programme spending in 20 countries).  A worthwhile aid relationship with countries in these regions should be maintained through deployment of the British Partnership Scheme and through UK contributions channelled via multilateral organisations.  The savings that would be achieved by reducing the country programme effort in these regions should be redeployed in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where aid needs are greater.  This should be taken forward in future Resource Allocation Rounds.</h4>





	<li>	Concentrating country programmes on fewer recipients (by extending British Partnership Scheme-only status to many more) should help to raise the quality of bilateral aid by focusing the efforts of ODA staff.  But the quality of their inputs can be further enhanced by removing other constraints on ODA's effectiveness.



	 <p>

<li>	In this respect, we took a particularly close look at the country programming process which is, after all, the part of ODA's activities most directly under its control.  The heart of this is the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for ODA's larger programmes.  The existing CSP process appears deficient in helping programme managers to reach considered judgements about ODA's niche.  CSPs would be more convincing in this respect if they analysed the environment in which ODA will operate, the resources and capabilities available to ODA, the choice of objectives linked to ODA's aims and appropriate performance measures, and the implementation process.  CSPs would be further strengthened if they took more account of non-ODA perspectives.



<h4>We recommend ODA should redesign the approach to CSPs so as to ensure that they identify ODA's niche more clearly, in particular in terms of its aims, the country requirements and activities of other donors (including multilateral agencies).  Programme managers should also be urged to adopt a strategy formulation process which includes the involvement of non-ODA expertise, including from the recipient country.  To allow for the extra time and effort required to develop CSPs, they should be produced every three years (instead of two as now).</h4>



</ul>

<h2>STRATEGIC CHOICES AND MANAGEMENT OF BILATERAL NON-COUNTRY PROGRAMMES</h2>



11.	The bilateral non-country programmes are very different from each other.  There is no single thread of issues common to them all as there is with the country programmes.  Therefore we analysed each in turn to see if there are ways in which ODA could enhance its effectiveness and reached the following conclusions:-



	<ul><li>	As with ODA's country programmes, the contribution of each non-country programme to the achievement of ODA's aims needs to be clear.



<h4>We therefore recommend that ODA should, for each non-country programme that it finances, produce a triennial Strategy Paper drawn up on the same lines as CSPs and subject to the same senior management and Ministerial scrutiny.  This should set out how ODA will use that channel to contribute to ODA's aims.</h4>





<li>	This should help to sharpen the focus of existing programmes on ODA's aims, and improve monitoring and evaluation against them.  Even quick-responding programmes like emergency aid, or collaborative schemes like the Joint Financing Scheme, can thus increase the effectiveness of their contribution.



 <p>

<li>	ODA provides a share of the British Council's Grant-in-Aid (the last survivor of this form of core funding).  The Grant-in-Aid covers Council standing capacity (offices and staff) and a number of small-scale activities in countries eligible for aid.  The Council receives from ODA as a contractor under country programmes more than twice as much as through the ODA Grant-in-Aid.  ODA's shareholder relationship with the Council through the Grant-in-Aid distorts the customer/contractor relationship under the country programmes.  We examined a range of options that might separate standing capacity from accountable activity, create a level playing field, and yet not lose the contribution which the Council can make to development.



<h4>We recommend that management responsibility for that part of the ODA's share of the British Council Grant-in-Aid which funds standing capacity be transferred to the DW.  The remaining element of ODA's share of the British Council Grant-in-Aid should be retained and converted into an accountable grant for agreed activities, with objectives related to ODA's aims.</h4>





	<li>	ODA funds three scholarship programmes through central allocations.  The British Chevening Scholarships - a jointly funded scheme with the Diplomatic Wing - are administered by the DW.  The Commonwealth Scholarship & Fellowship Programme (CSFP), enshrined in the 1980 Overseas Development and Co-operation Act, is managed by the Association of Commonwealth Universities on behalf of the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission:  ODA fund the UK awards to developing countries, and Britain provides more than half the awards in the scheme (Canada is the next largest donor).  The much smaller ODA Shared Scholarships Scheme is co-financed with British Universities.



	< p>

 <li>      	The amount of money spent on each scholarship scheme is determined centrally.  If these funds were to be distributed to country programmes, they would be put to the highest priority use in each country, in a country strategy that reflects ODA's aims.  This could include financing scholarships, for example through the Chevening and CSFP schemes.  The mechanisms of these two schemes would remain available, provided that there is a transition period to allow them to adjust to the different source of funding.  This would also take care of existing awards made under the central allocation.



<h4>We recommend that the central allocations for British Chevening Scholarships, the Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships Programme, and the Shared Scholarships Scheme be dissolved, and the funds allocated to country programmes.  For a transition period, some of these funds should be earmarked for the first two schemes.</h4>





<li>	Leading British Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are development organisations with their own fields of comparative advantage.  ODA works with NGOs through country programmes, emergency aid, and the Joint Funding Scheme (JFS).  Most activities funded from country programmes follow from ODA's initiatives, in which NGOs are one of a range of possible contractors.   JFS co-finances projects proposed by NGOs.  Emergency aid falls somewhere between these two poles.



<p>

<li>	We concluded that ODA should regard its support for NGOs under the JFS as a contribution to a shared agenda, and wherever possible minimise ODA's interference in those aspects of development in which they are expert.  However, ODA needs to retain sufficient confidence in the key management systems of such organisations, together with agreements on the use of ODA funds and close enough audit involvement, to allow it to "certify" them as partners and thus take a more "hand-off" role.  In other cases, such as smaller NGOs, ODA can help to improve their activities through close co-operation in project assessment and financing.



<p>

<li>	While NGOs can often reach the poor more directly than government agencies, they are an inappropriate vehicle for policy dialogue and many recipient governments are sensitive about the extent of their role in official aid programmes.  This, together with the need for transparency in the choice of executing agents for country programme activities, means that aid through NGOs cannot substitute for government-to-government dialogue and openly tendered  projects.



<p>

<li>	Given the myriad and growing relationships between ODA and the NGO community, it would be helpful to take stock of the current position and the way it should evolve.

  

<h4>We recommend that more of ODA's co-financing of NGOs through the JFS should be on the basis of "certification" of NGOs' systems.  ODA should also examine, and if necessary update, its policy on working with NGOs.</h4>





	<li>	ODA's Technology Development and Research (TDR) programmes contribute both to the development of techniques relevant to the needs of people in developing countries and to the maintenance of British know-how in fields important to the aid programme as a whole.  They have substantial strategy documents, but their management systems vary widely.  They have until now been based on professional (essentially sectoral) allocations rather than on ODA's aims.  ODA would benefit from still closer co-ordination of research programmes to draw together the common threads (such as intellectual property rights) and to guide professionals (who will define TDR strategies and consider thematic choices for research) on best practice in the management of their research programmes.



<h4>We recommend that ODA's TDR programmes be reallocated to the promoters of the aims.  This will help to give greater emphasis to ODA's aims in the TDR programmes.  Consideration should also be given to new approaches to co-ordinating the management of TDR programmes.</h4>







	<li>	Since its guidelines were revised in 1993, Aid & Trade Provision (ATP) projects have been of similar quality to other bilateral aid.  The effectiveness of ATP would be further enhanced if it were more closely integrated into country programmes, allowing more efficient project selection and greater coherence.  This should not be at the expense of speed of response.  ATP also needs updated guidelines for companies applying for support.



<h4>We recommend that ATP be fully integrated into country programmes from 1996/97.  A joint DTI/ODA team should develop new guidelines for applicants, and market them to British industry.</h4>



</ul>

<h2>STRATEGIC CHOICES IN MULTILATERAL AID</h2>



12.	ODA's systems are very much geared to delivering an effective bilateral aid programme.  As multilateral aid will soon overtake bilateral aid under any assumptions about the total size of the Aid Budget, ODA recognises that a shift in its focus is required.  ODA will need to put more of its effort into improving the quality of multilateral aid, and exploiting opportunities (e.g. as provided through synergies with the bilateral aid programme) to use it to support UK priorities.  The task of the FER team was to gauge whether the changes in train go far enough and whether there is scope for the UK, acting with others, to make multilateral aid more effective.  We reached the following conclusions:-



	<ul><li>	The 1994 Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) sought to adapt ODA's operations and the deployment of its staff resources in response to the trend increase in multilateral aid.  As part of this shift, ODA has sought to give greater prominence to operational objectives which capture its managerial/stewardship role with regard to multilateral aid (e.g. by setting these out in the 1995 Departmental Report).  To achieve these objectives will require ODA to persuade other contributors and the multilateral institutions themselves to pursue the same ends.  It will also require a culture change within ODA that the MAR sought to promote, e.g. bilateral country programme managers will need to give greater attention to forging links with their EC counterparts and achieving some of our objectives through the EC.  



	<p>

<li>	We endorse the thrust of the MAR in this respect but believe ODA should take it further.  Three fundamental changes are required.  First, ODA should adopt a high-level aim which relates directly to its multilateral aid work.  The existing priority objectives are more clearly linked to bilateral aid.  The fourth aim recommended earlier will capture ODA's activities with regard to the multilateral development institutions.  Second, the relationships between ODA staff dealing with bilateral aid and those responsible for multilateral aid need to be strengthened at the strategic level in order to maximise the organisation's effectiveness in both parts of the aid programme.  And third, multilateral aid should be more explicitly subject to the same strategic disciplines as bilateral aid.



<h4>To help bring about the latter two changes, we recommend: 



-	International Division be formally involved in the formulation of ODA's bilateral CSPs;  and 



-	International Division should consult ODA geographical divisions, Treasury, Diplomatic Wing and - as recommended for CSPs - others outside Whitehall with relevant expertise as required in preparing strategies for the three main areas of multilateral aid (EC, the banks and funds, and the UN) for consideration every three years (one area per year).  These Multilateral Strategy Papers should be considered by the same senior management team that vets CSPs before submission to the ODA Minister.   </h4>





	<li>	EC aid programmes charged to ODA's budget can be split into the European Development Fund (EDF) and "budgetised" programmes.  ODA has some control over the size of its contributions to the EDF; it has very little over the budgetised programmes which are the fastest growing component of EC aid.  In terms of development impact, the EDF is broadly equivalent to the performance of an average bilateral donor but below that of UK bilateral aid.  The EC budgetised programmes are less effective.



	<p>

<li>	ODA's operational objectives for EC aid are:  to contribute to making EC aid as effective as possible;  to ensure maximum complementarity between EC aid and UK bilateral aid;  and to ensure that expenditure remains within agreed ceilings and addresses agreed priority areas.  ODA has generally succeeded in ensuring that the EC's formal statements of development policy are in line with the UK's own aid strategy.  But the ability of ODA (and other like-minded member states) to influence the management and operations of the Community is generally much weaker.  And ODA has been relatively unsuccessful in holding down and prioritising expenditures under the EC budget.  Nevertheless, the operational objectives remain appropriate and ODA should continue to seek new means for achieving them.



	<p>

<li>	The World Bank Group of institutions is at the centre of the global development effort.  ODA's main contribution to the Group covers replenishments of the International Development Association (IDA), the body that provides concessional credits to the poorest countries.  ODA also contributes the UK's share of capital subscribed by member governments to back the borrowings of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which lends at market rates to creditworthy member governments, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which lends directly to the private sector.  ODA also contributes to the interest subsidy account for the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) from which the poorest countries may borrow on concessional terms.



	<p>

<li>	There is a high degree of congruence between Bank and Fund objectives and ODA's aims.  This, and professional links developed through the bilateral programme, allows ODA to wield considerable influence in the Bank, e.g. through the SPA mechanism.  ODA wields much less influence on the IMF although there is increasing direct contact on countries where the UK is perceived to be a leading player.  ODA's operational objectives for the Bank Group are:  to promote UK interests as a shareholder effectively;  and working closely with like-minded shareholders, to help maintain the Bank as an efficient and effective institution contributing to international economic development.



	<p>

<li>	Given the relative effectiveness of the Bank Group, these do not include the search for reductions in ODA's financial contributions. Whether the UK maintains the same share of IDA XI (which is currently being negotiated) as for IDA X will depend essentially on the total size of the new replenishment, which in turn will depend on the position taken by the USA.  But ODA should certainly question the need for future IBRD general capital increases given the flow of private capital to creditworthy developing countries, although this issue is unlikely to feature on the international agenda for the foreseeable future.



	<p>

<li>	ODA also covers HMG's capital subscriptions and soft fund contributions to the regional development banks.  The objectives of these institutions are in line with ODA's aims but their effectiveness varies greatly.  The influence that ODA can exert in the regional banks is limited by the level of our shareholdings.  But ODA should question, with other like-minded members, whether the efforts of the World Bank and the regional banks should be rationalised and focused more on the poorer countries and - for a period - the countries in transition.  With this in mind, ODA should question the need for general capital increases for the regional banks.  Similarly, it would be right for ODA to uphold the key role of IDA in channelling soft multilateral funds to the poorest countries and take a restrictive line in future replenishments of other concessional funds.  If successful, this approach might put off or minimise general capital increases and replenishments of the soft funds of the regional banks and push them towards focusing, in particular in middle-income Latin America and Asia, on providing technical assistance rather than capital to their members.



	<p>

<li>	UN development organisations to which ODA contributes financially can be divided into two categories:  those to which the UK makes a voluntary payment and those to which the contribution is assessed as a consequence of membership.  In general, the objectives of the UN agencies match ODA's aims, but with a greater focus on human resource development concerns.  The agencies are of widely varying quality in terms of developmental effectiveness and managerial efficiency.  Moreover, there is a considerable degree of overlap in their activities and some perform tasks similar to those handled by the World Bank Group and the regional banks.



	<p>

<li>	In this light, ODA's broad operational objective for the UN agencies - "to improve the effectiveness of UN agencies in meeting their development objectives through management reform" - is clearly appropriate.  But ODA's influence and hence its ability to meet this objective is constrained - as it is for other OECD states - by the combined voice of the developing countries, which do not always share the same objectives.  Nevertheless, ODA has, together with some other OECD countries, made headway in promoting reform in a number of the UN agencies.  ODA plans to review in late 1996 the case for further actions.



	<p>

<li>	In the meantime, ODA should continue to pursue the reform agenda.  It should also consider as part of the 1996 review whether the UN development system would not be more effective through consolidation of UN technical assistance functions, rationalisation of the work on emergencies, and whether some organisations could be either slimmed down or abolished.  ODA should also seek, together with other countries, to have the Secretary General require tighter coordination of all UN agencies.



<h4>Our suggestions above for ODA actions in each of the main areas of multilateral aid are broadly in line with existing policy.  They also endorse the recommendations on international institutions emanating from the recent G7 Summit at Halifax, an opportunity which ODA should vigorously exploit.  Some savings may result over time and, if so, should be redeployed to higher priority uses in the aid programme.</h4>



</ul>

<h2>IMPROVING MANAGEMENT</h2>



13.	We also considered ways in which the management of the aid programme could be improved to enhance ODA's effectiveness.  We reached the following conclusions:-



	<ul><li>	ODA's management style has evolved pragmatically.  It has responded to a variety of circumstances around the world;  fashioned different approaches for its various types of business;  and found ways of collaborating successfully with the Diplomatic Wing of the Foreign Office in both traditional and novel areas.  



	<p >

<li>	This has bred a diversity of systems.  Best practice has been encouraged to fit particular circumstances.  There has been a trend towards stationing more staff and their work overseas, nearer to the processes they are attempting to influence;  research strategies have been honed gradually to a sharper focus on impact;  and new and more effective ways of influencing multilateral institutions have been employed, for example by sharing our reform objectives openly with their management and by seconding experts on aid management to work within their organisations. 



	<p>

<li>	ODA has been diligent in assessing the evidence for new management structures, but objective evidence on effectiveness is often unavailable.  It would be desirable to supplement intuitive judgements with more concrete information where this is possible.



<h4>We recommend ODA should find ways of measuring the relative effectiveness and efficiency of its different models of country aid management.  The current study of the relative costs of managing know-how and technical co-operation, drawing on the experience of the Know-How Fund, should be extended to all forms of aid.  The costs to be measured should not be restricted to the running costs of ODA but should include the costs to the aid programme of managing aid transactions in recipient countries.</h4>





	<li>	As patterns of aid change, ODA should be alert to the need to adjust management arrangements.  This will be the case, for example, where country programmes evolve, albeit slowly, through their graduation strategies.  And incremental changes should be supplemented by an overview from time to time.  A number of commentators inside and outside ODA have pointed to some areas requiring attention now.



<h4>We recommend that the future of the Development Division in the Caribbean (BDDC) should be reviewed within two years, as the unit cost of administering its small programmes is high and is likely to increase with declining aid volumes.  Decisions about new management arrangements in Asia should take account of the earlier recommendation on graduation of much of South-East Asia from ODA's country programmes.</h4>





	<li>	A willingness to tolerate diversity has been associated with a willingness to delegate.  The approval of aid commitments is delegated on a graduated basis, relating the amount to staff grades.  Running cost budgets are delegated to divisions and departments.  Posts are advertised and line managers select staff. 



	<p>

 <li>	Delegation has been accompanied by decentralisation from headquarters to overseas offices.  Rigorous reviews have been conducted to ensure that there is no duplication between headquarters and overseas.  This has been implemented fully except where it created problems of coordination for the Diplomatic Wing.  Decentralisation has been restricted largely to country aid.  We have looked at the scope for delegating more to our offices in multilateral organisations.  In most cases, it is not practical because they are shared offices.  However, there is scope for doing so with our office in the World Bank.  



<h4>We recommend delegating greater authority to the Executive Director and his ODA staff in the UK Delegation to the World Bank in Washington in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency.  This depends, however, on agreement on  the nature of that delegation, full accountability and adequate reporting lines.</h4>





	<li>	ODA guides decision-making processes by rules and advice but allows a fair measure of discretion in implementation.  A current Efficiency Scrutiny suggests that this discretion is exercised with an unexpected degree of variation.  In these circumstances, rules are not a good way of ensuring adequate management standards. At the same time, some line managers feel that the rules do not give adequate recognition of their need to tailor their approach to their specific circumstances.



<h4>We recommend that the Efficiency Scrutiny on delegated authority should examine whether written agreements with managers on tasks and procedures could be an effective alternative to codes of rules. </h4>





<li>	Those who work for ODA need to enhance their skills if they are to respond to the increasing complexity of aid and the demands for more accountability.  To this end, we recommend career anchors for administrators and targeted action for contract staff.  ODA is revising its training strategy to match key competences.  Its Personnel Policy Statement identified the need to create a staff 'margin' to accommodate more training and more effective hand-overs of posts.



<h4>We recommend that ODA finds the resources to enhance the skills of those who work on the aid programme.</h4>





	<li>	ODA has a number of formal and ad hoc management consultancy services addressing its own organisational needs.  The effectiveness of these services varies considerably.  There are also overlaps between audit functions and these services.



<h4>We recommend the re-organisation of ODA's internal management consultancy services into a single unit and a rationalisation of their role in relation to audit.</h4>

</ul>



<h2>IMPROVING EFFICIENCY</h2>



14.	We have considered the techniques which ODA has used to achieve value for money and the scope for further economies.  We have reached the following conclusions:-

	<ul><li>	ODA has been successful in improving its efficiency.  One measure is the movement in staff numbers.  These have declined by 30% since 1979 in both ODA headquarters and in its agency, the Natural Resources Institute.  This compares with a reduction of 4.5% in the real value of total aid.  At the same time, the number of aid recipients has increased and our widening knowledge of development processes has made aid management more complex: there is more emphasis on policy dialogue, support with small packages of know-how and working on an inter-disciplinary basis.



	<p>

<li>	Economies have been achieved by the process of delegation and by rigorous reviews to avoid duplication.  In recent years, ODA has run the most extensive market testing programme in Whitehall.  50% of ODA posts will be covered; average cash-releasing savings have been 20%, with 30% savings in posts. 



	 <p>

 <li>	NRI has conducted its own FER, which was reported in 'NRI 2000'.  This will yield substantial running cost savings, but add some tasks in ODA headquarters if NRI is privatised.



	 <p>

 <li>	In future, economies will be more difficult to achieve. Even so, ODA must live within a running cost budget which will have been frozen for four years by 1997/98. 



<h4>In order to achieve the 17% efficiency gains over four years implied by our running cost ceilings, ODA will need to adopt a variety of techniques in future.  New approaches should include benchmarking, process re-engineering, and the application of private financing.</h4>





	<li>	Substantial savings should be achievable from accommodation when our 94 Victoria Street office lease expires in 2000.  At current market rates, this should be in excess of £4 million if we move to new premises in London.



	<p>

<li>	We have also looked at how ODA could save 10% on its running costs as a special case.  To achieve this over and above present plans would require a sharp reduction in the number of aid recipients (as recommended earlier) and a narrowing in the range of activities, such as education and population, which ODA supports.  It may also require a reversion to fewer, larger infrastructure projects.  

</ul>

<h2>IMPROVING INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h2>



15.	The development of information systems (IS) is a vital enabling mechanism for implementing the improvements in effectiveness and efficiency recommended in this review.  We have therefore examined the management of the IS function in depth.  Our conclusions are:-



<ul><li>	ODA IS has been unusually successful in Whitehall and has made important contributions on telecommunications and management information.   In future, changes in hardware and software, such as the switch to "open systems" and Windows software for personal computers, will make it possible to respond more quickly and cheaply to user requirements while also making it easier for users to present data in ways they find most useful.  This will help reduce the backlog of user requests and so improve efficiency. 



<li>	A fundamental look was last taken in 1989 at the underlying information requirements which IS should be serving. Those created by resource accounting are already being considered.  But there may be other new requirements yet to be taken into account.



<h4>We recommend a full examination of information requirements and flows to which IS might be relevant. </h4>





<li>	Best practice elsewhere places a strong emphasis on user involvement and responsibility. At present, IS development and operations tends to be highly centralized. This is in part because most users are ill-equipped to play the intelligent client or owner role.  It is important to break what can become a vicious circle.



<h4>We recommend a four-step process to ensure user involvement:



<ul><li>	a programme of user training with a particular focus on senior managers; 



<li>	the creation of a user service brigaded to user divisions; 



<li>	delegating budgets and responsibility for systems to users;  and



<li>	new management systems for approving strategies and spending. 

</ul>

We also recommend that, as information systems development is not part of ODA's core business, large projects should be contracted out or staff contracted in.  </h4>



</ul>

<h2>ANNEX</h2>



<h3 align=center>ODA FUNDAMENTAL EXPENDITURE

AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT REVIEWS

<p>



TERMS OF REFERENCE</h3>





The Foreign Secretary and the Chief Secretary have agreed that ODA will undertake a Fundamental Expenditure Review and a Senior Management Review.  These will take account of the policy framework established by Ministers in January 1995, and are being conducted as part of the action covering areas considered in the Civil Service White Paper Continuity and Change.





<h3 align=center>FUNDAMENTAL EXPENDITURE REVIEW</h3>



1.	The ODA Fundamental Expenditure Review (FER) will examine:



	<ul><li>the role of aid and what this means for ODA's objectives;



	<li>the resources required and available to carry out that purpose, and ODA's inescapable commitments;



	<li>the effectiveness of the channels, forms and systems for achieving that purpose and the scope for the redeployment of resources within the aid programme;  and



	<li>the efficiency and economy with which the ODA manages its activities.

</ul>



<h4>A)	The Purpose of ODA's activities</h4>





2.	The FER will, under this heading, consider the broad rationale for ODA's activities.  It will go on to examine ODA's mission statement and the objectives of the aid programme and form judgements as to their appropriateness.  





<h4>B)	Programme Resources</h4>





3.	The FER will focus on the Aid Budget sub-programme and, within that, on programme resources (as running costs are covered in Section E).  The FER will examine the demand for grant aid resources and trends in resource transfers by other donors as well as the UK.  It will also take account of the overall foreign policy framework set by Ministers and internationally-agreed targets on aid levels.  In this context and on the basis of a projection of possible aid levels over the next ten years, the FER will consider the case for continuing British official aid, including the balance between bilateral and multilateral aid.





<h4>C)	Channels, Forms, and Effectiveness</h4>





4.	In the light of the Government's objectives for using the aid programme and the prospective resources position, the FER will consider:



<ul><li>	the effectiveness in terms of developmental impact of the main bilateral and multilateral channels, including linkages between them, for UK aid delivery (drawing on the views of recipients, of suppliers, and of other Whitehall Departments, as well as interviews with ODA staff);



<li>	the forms of aid available within those channels;



	<li>	the role and effectiveness of the ODA in advocating Government policies in bilateral and multilateral aid fora;



	<li>	how constraints to greater effectiveness - in terms of developmental impact and the ODA's advocacy role - might be addressed.

</ul>

The FER will go on to assess the case for changes in channels and forms of aid or in their relative weight;  and whether policies should be adjusted in ways which might help better to achieve the objectives of the aid programme.





<h4>D)	Aid Management Systems and Organisational Culture</h4>





5.	In the light of the conclusions of Sections A to C, the FER will examine existing ODA management systems and culture.  This will define the tasks involved in aid management and administration, including the advocacy of ODA's objectives, bilaterally and multilaterally.  It will include examination of:



<ul><li>	central service/policy and programme spending functions;



<li>	perceptions of ODA's organisational culture, including the results of a sample survey;



	<li>	the effectiveness of the systems in place in ODA for achieving the Government's objectives for the aid programme, including value for money; and



<li>	whether ODA's systems should be redesigned in ways which might help better to achieve the objectives of the aid programme.

</ul>



<h4>E)	Running Cost Resources </h4>





6.	In the light of Sections A to D, the FER will consider:



<ul><li>	the running costs available to ODA, prospects for the future, and ODA's continuing ability to deliver a high-quality aid programme; 



	<li>	the relative administrative/management costs of the various channels and forms of aid available to ODA; and



<li>	the relationship between the deployment of administrative costs and of programme resources.



</ul>

7.	The FER will also examine the deployment, development and training of staff and the use of other resources to meet changing requirements.  The recommendations of the FER will inform the ODA Senior Management Review.





<h3>SENIOR MANAGEMENT REVIEW</h3>



<h4>A)	Objectives</h4>





8.	To ensure that the senior management of the ODA is organised in such a way that the Minister for Overseas Development and the Secretary of State receive the best possible advice on policy development; on the handling of international negotiations; and on their Parliamentary and other domestic responsibilities.



 <p>



9.	To ensure that ODA policies can be effectively implemented in the light of the Fundamental Expenditure Review; and that the services for which ODA is responsible can be effectively and efficiently delivered.



<p>



10.	To match the needs of the work with the most effective and efficient management structure, with clear lines of responsibility and accountability, taking account of the requirements and priorities of Ministers, and the performance of statutory duties and the demand for services from Parliament and the public.



<p>



11.	To consider whether it would be practicable to reduce layers of management and increase management spans where appropriate, based on a clear understanding of the added value of each level of management.











<h4>B)	Scope</h4>





12.	The Review will cover all posts at Head of Department level and above, including those currently graded at G6 level.  It will include posts based overseas as well as in the UK.  It will also cover the professional and advisory cadres as well as administrative posts.  The reviewers should take account of the Fundamental Expenditure Review and previous reviews which have affected ODA's senior management structure - in particular the 1992 Review of Aid Management Overseas and the 1994 reviews of Africa Division and the proposed AidÊManagement Office in Delhi.  They should also take account of the 1993 reviews of Bilateral Aid and Multilateral Aid.  They should look forward to, but not anticipate the results of, the work on delegated pay and grading to be undertaken over 1995-96.





<h3>FER AND SMR ORGANISATION, CONSULTATION AND TIMETABLE</h3>



13.	The FER and SMR will be conducted sequentially, but with some overlap, with the FER coming first.  Maximum use will be made of existing work, including recent reviews, but their conclusions will be examined to see whether they stand up in the context of the FER and SMR.  The main source of new data will be extensive interviews, in the UK (London and East Kilbride) and with overseas-based staff, as well as meetings with staff to encourage them to contribute their views, and interviews to gain the views of outsiders, including other Government Departments who have an interest in ODA's work. 



<p>



14.	The FER will be carried out by MrÊChakrabarti, Mr Wilson and Dr Rundell.  The SMR will be carried out by Mr Wilson, who will be assisted by a senior member of the Management Review Staff (MRS) in assessing job structure and weights, including through the use of JESP, and who will also have a budget to draw in outside consultancy advice as required.  Mr Manning (PFO) and Mr Freeman (PEO) will be responsible for day-to-day management of the FER.  And Mr Freeman (PEO) will have the day-to-day management responsibility for the SMR.



<p>



15.	A Steering Committee, chaired by MrÊVereker, will guide the work of both the FER and the SMR.  This will comprise MrÊAinscow, the PEO, the PFO, an ODA geographical Under Secretary, a Chief Adviser, a representative of HM Treasury and OPSS and a private sector representative.  It will consider emerging conclusions and approve a draft report.  The Steering Committee will keep the Secretary of State and Lady Chalker informed of progress, and the Chairman will report on progress to Lady Chalker regularly.  Mr Vereker will submit a final draft report to Ministers.

<p>





16.	The Aid Policy and Management Group will be consulted at intervals throughout the process, as will a Focus Group established in connection with the Strategic Management Plan.  The ToRs will be communicated to the Departmental Trade Union Side (DTUS) and to staff.  The DTUS will be kept informed of progress.



<p>



17.	The intention is that the broad timetable will be as set out below; the Steering Committee will keep this under review as the work proceeds:



<ul>	<h4>January-February 1995</h4>



Agreement on TORs, membership of the SteeringÊGroup and appointment of reviewers.  



<h4>By mid-July 1995</h4>



Completion of FER.



<h4>By end-July 1995</h4>



Completion of SMR.



Revision of proposals, submission to Ministers and decisions on outcome of Reviews.

<HR>

<P>

Contribuer &agrave; consolider la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile

au Sud et faire de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement une

cause nationale, tels sont aujourd'hui les enjeux du dialogue

instaur&eacute; par la Commission Coop&eacute;ration D&eacute;veloppement,

entre pouvoirs publics et associations.

<P>

Depuis plus de vingt ans, les ONG ont contribu&eacute; &agrave;

inventer l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement de base : elles participent

aujourd'hui &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration d'une nouvelle forme

de coop&eacute;ration qui fait de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile

le socle de tout d&eacute;veloppement. Les groupes de travail

et les comit&eacute;s de programme anim&eacute;s par la Commission

permettent des &eacute;changes et d&eacute;bats f&eacute;conds

entre acteurs de terrain, responsables d'associations et repr&eacute;sentants

des minist&egrave;res.

<P>

La Commission, en &eacute;troite relation avec le bureau de la

vie associative, commun au minist&egrave;re des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res

et au minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration, met en place

ce qu'il convient d'appeler une nouvelle contractualisation entre

pouvoirs publics et organisations de solidarit&eacute; internationale

(OSI). Des programmes prioritaires devraient permettre de construire

des actions coordonn&eacute;es des OSI fran&ccedil;aises dans

un pays donn&eacute;. Les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;

civile (OSC) de ce pays seront par l&agrave; m&ecirc;me conduites

&agrave; se f&eacute;d&eacute;rer. En cela, la premi&egrave;re

exp&eacute;rience de ce type, en cours &agrave; Madagascar, devrait

&ecirc;tre riche d'enseignements. En effet, le travail des OSI

fran&ccedil;aises a d&eacute;j&agrave; induit sur place une forte

mobilisation des OSC locales. Prenant conscience de leur propre

existence et de leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; se f&eacute;d&eacute;rer

autour d'un projet, les associations malgaches semblent pr&ecirc;tes

&agrave; ces nouveaux partenariats fond&eacute;s sur la parit&eacute;.

<P>

<H3>Vers des assises de la coop&eacute;ration</H3>

<P>

Il s'agit de redynamiser l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement en en

faisant une grande cause nationale. Les r&eacute;seaux associatifs

sont riches d'id&eacute;es, de projets, et les volont&eacute;s

d'agir ne manquent pas. Ce qui fait d&eacute;faut, c'est un grand

courant mobilisateur et f&eacute;d&eacute;rateur. Les partenaires

de la Commission cherchent &agrave; r&eacute;inventer une v&eacute;ritable

p&eacute;dagogie civique de l'aide. Selon Th&eacute;r&egrave;se

Pujolle, secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, &quot;il est

n&eacute;cessaire de trouver de nouveaux mots pour convaincre&quot;.

 La Commission contribue d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; &agrave;

un projet d'envergure : l'organisation d'assises de la coop&eacute;ration

et de la solidarit&eacute; internationale, &agrave; l'horizon

du printemps 1997, qui visent &agrave; informer l'opinion publique

et &agrave; la remobiliser autour de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement.

Ces assises, r&eacute;gionales dans un premier temps, r&eacute;uniront

les pouvoirs publics, les collectivit&eacute;s locales et le monde

associatif. Un grand rassemblement final devrait permettre la

mise en commun des travaux pour de nouvelles pratiques de l'aide

au d&eacute;veloppement.

<title>World Aids Day : Effective Aids Action In Developing Countries Threatened By Funding Crisis</title>
</head>
<body>
<i>The material that follows has been provided by International HIV/AIDS Alliance</i>
<hr>

<h4>PRESS RELEASE<br>
Friday 1st December 1995</h4>
<center><h3>WORLD AIDS DAY : EFFECTIVE AIDS ACTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THREATENED BY FUNDING CRISIS</h3></center>

The failure of the international community to support inexpensive HIV prevention campaigns has already led to an explosion of HIV in some parts of Asia, and is putting new regions of the world at risk, says the International HIV/AIDS Alliance [Note 1] on World AIDS Day, December 1st. The Alliance - a UK-based charity supporting community action on HIV/AIDS in developing countries - says that, while community groups are effectively responding to local epidemics, their efforts are threatened by declining AIDS budgets and out of sight, out of mind attitudes.

<p>Where funds have been invested in community activities in the last three years - as in parts of Tanzania and Thailand - there have been impressive successes at slowing the rate of growth of the HIV epidemic [Note 2]. 

<p>The Alliance cited a number of key donor countries that are failing to invest adequately in HIV/AIDS programmes:
<ul>
<li>In Britain, the overseas aid budget has faced persistent threats over recent years and may be axed by up to 12% in real terms over the next three years [Note 3]. Funding allocated to HIV/AIDS may be cut accordingly. . In the United States of America, the Senate and House of Representatives has reduced overall foreign aid by 12%. With large budgets to Israel and Egypt remaining intact, other budget areas face severe cuts. HIV/AIDS will no longer be earmarked and will have to compete for funds with other priorities. <p>

<li>In France, the government has recently announced sweeping cuts to their development assistance budget, including retroactive cuts on AIDS funds previously committed. This includes FF 100 million ($US 20.6 million) 
pledged for follow-up action to the 1994 Paris AIDS Summit [Note 4]. . UNAIDS - the new United Nations programme on AIDS funded by member states - is starting in 1996 with an annual budget 25% lower than that allocated to its predecessor, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Programme on AIDS, five years ago. Over the same period, the number of people in the world with HIV is estimated to have more than doubled.</ul>

<p>It is inexcusable that, at the very time when support is most needed - and community groups are making highly effective use of resources - funding for HIV/AIDS is at best staying stable, and at worst plummeting rapidly, says Jeffrey O Malley, Executive Director, International HIV/AIDS Alliance. 

<p>In 1993, contributions to HIV/AIDS work represented less than one-half of a per cent of all official development assistance from rich to poor countries. According to WHO, US$ 1.5 - 3 billion per year is needed for basic prevention of HIV and other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) in developing countries, yet only 10% of these funds are currently available. . While 93% of people with AIDS live in developing countries, only 8% of HIV/AIDS funding is allocated to these regions. World-wide, almost five times as much money is spent on AIDS care than on HIV prevention. 

<p>The Alliance supports over 100 community projects in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ecuador, the Philippines, Senegal and Sri Lanka. By working with linking organisations - support programmes run by local leaders - it channels international resources to HIV/AIDS responses such as :<ul>

<li>Nobtondo Women s Group, Boulonga, Burkina Faso : aims to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and STDs among local villagers. The project aims to train educators, facilitate local discussions and use traditional drama and music to convey HIV/AIDS prevention and care messages.<p>

<li>Fundacion Nuestros Jovenes, Loja Province, Ecuador : provides sexual education to adolescents. The project uses training and the mass media - including radio programmes - to provide young people with a broad view on sexuality, including information about HIV/AIDS.<p>

<li>The Society for People Centred Development, Colombo, Sri Lanka : aims to incorporate HIV/AIDS into development work among slum populations. It works with community leaders - who are often rehabilitated alcoholics or drug users - to assess effective ways to mobilise people about HIV/AIDS. </ul>

<p>
Community groups throughout the developing world are showing that there is a positive side to HIV/AIDS - that action can be taken, lives saved and people already affected provided with support , says Jeffrey O Malley. In reality, however, their work remains largely un-recognised and under-supported. If we re to stand a chance of fighting HIV/AIDS, this has to change.

<p><i>Notes to Editors : </i><br>
[1] The International HIV/AIDS Alliance was established in 1993. In each country where it works, the Alliance channels technical expertise, management support and funds to linking organisations - independent groups led by local leaders from areas such as health and community development. In turn, linking organisations assess local needs, set priorities and allocate resources to community organisations responding to HIV/AIDS. (Information pack available on request)<br>
[2] Tanzania : In Mwanza, a primary health care project demonstrated that rates of HIV infection can be reduced through improved treatment of STDs. In communities targeted for improved treatment, the incidence rate of reported new HIV infections was 1.2%; in other communities it was 1.9%. It is estimated that the overall incidence of HIV was reduced by 42%. Thailand : A collaborative programme which combined supportive government policies and service delivery by nongovernmental organisations has caused the reported incidence of STDs to decrease by 77% in two years. (Further details of these and other case studies available on request).<br>
 [3] Please note : Details of the new level of UK overseas development assistance should be checked against the Budget of 28th November. Final decisions concerning AIDS funding will be taken by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) in subsequent months.<br>
[4] The 1994 Paris AIDS Summit brought together Heads of Governments and other officials from 42 countries. The conference culminated in the signing of a World AIDS Day Declaration including commitments to the greater involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS and community organisations in national, regional and international responses to HIV/AIDS.<br>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. ACP DEFINES ITS POSITION ON FUTURE CO-OPERATION

WITH EU - &quot;OVERALL ACP FRAMEWORK TO BE OBTAINED&quot;<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>As the EC prepares to launch its debate on future

ACP/EU relations with its Green Paper the ACP countries are holding

their own discussions on the framework of co-operation with the

EU. At the end of the ACP Council on Friday 16 November, the Council

under the Chairmanship of Rajkeswur Purryag of Mauritius, came

to the following conclusions: a) To reaffirm its will to intensify

ACP/EU co-operation while retaining the overall ACP framework

without ruling out the possibility to modify different elements

of the current co-operation in response to the particular needs

of certain ACP groups b) to prioritise the fight against poverty,

malnutrition and famine c) emphasise the importance of co-operation

in the promotion of the private sector, rural development, industrialisation

and increase in investment flows.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>A series of earlier meetings of the Sub-Committee

briefed by the Council of Ambassadors examined the following issues

- regionalisation of ACP-EU co-operation, increase in the number

of adherents to the Convention, the goals and principles of the

new Convention, donor fatigue, conflict management and prevention,

the future of trade regimes, the role of investment in the private

sector and aid flows and aid management. </FONT>

<UL>

<LI>A timetable of forthcoming work and activities leading up

to negotiations with the EU presented at the Council follows

<LI>end of ACP national and regional consultations - at latest

in March 1997

<LI>meeting of ACP Foreign ministers - September 1997

<LI>Summit of ACP heads of State - October 1997 (Libreville Gabon)

<LI>end of work on the assessment of aid to development - within

eighteen months

<LI>examination of the negotiating brief the EU Council is to

give the Commission - end 1997

<LI>beginning of negotiations over the new Convention - September

1998<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. EU SEEKS WEU CONTRIBUTION ON HOW BEST TO ASSIST

REFUGEES IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The European Union Development Council, meeting on

Friday the 23 November in the presence of Mr de Deus Pinheiro

and Ms. Bonino, EC Commissioners for Development and Humanitarian

Assistance respectively, is to adopt a &quot;joint action&quot;

and decision concerning its next move in the Great Lakes Region.

The EU will ask the WEU how it can best contribute &quot;to the

maximum use of available operational means&quot;, required to

implement the &quot;joint action&quot; to assist the refugees

in Eastern Zaire and facilitate their 'freely consented' return

to their countries of origin. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The Union will also confirm its support for the deployment

of a neutral international force with African participation. Earlier

on at the end of consultations with countries prepared to send

troops to the region, at the UN Headquarters in New York, Gordon

Smith, Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister, said that apart from

Rwanda all countries including Zaire still believe that the deployment

of a military force is still necessary. Canadian Prime Minister

Jean Chretien in agreement said in Ottawa that though the need

for military intervention was not as strong as it was two weeks

ago grave problems remain in providing for the refugees when they

arrive home. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. SOUTH AFRICAN DEPUTY PRESIDENT BRIEFS ACP COUNCIL

ON SOUTH AFRICA'S FREE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU <BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Thabo Mbeki, South African Deputy President,

on Friday 16 November delineated South Africa's position and view

on the proposed free trade agreement with the EU before the ACP

Council. Mr. Mbeki said, &quot;The initial European Position as

outlined in their opening negotiations mandate is not one which

lives up to our expectations nor to the original EU promises.

We are nevertheless, currently busy formulating an opening position

trade in a mandate for ourselves so that trade negotiations can

begin&quot;. He recalled South Africa's request two years ago

to the EU for full membership of the ACP, instead the EU had proposed

qualified membership of the ACP along with a bilateral agreement

with the EU with no &quot;developmentally oriented trade formula&quot;.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Mbeki reaffirmed that South Africa's negotiations

with the EU would have to be in accordance with its link to the

African continent as a whole to which it's democratic stability,

reconstruction and general development are connected. He said

the agreement with South Africa would have to 1) enhance the reconstruction

and development process in South Africa, 2) take account of South

Africa's relations with its SADC partners, 3) avoid creating a

negative precedent for the ACP in its future relationship with

South Africa 4) encourage the trade and investment in the region

and improve regional integration in the region. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>On qualified accession to the Lom&eacute; Convention

the South African Deputy President expressed his hope that the

Convention would enhance South Africa's potential role in the

region and co-operation with ACP countries. He stated that the

successor to the current Lom&eacute; Convention would have to

be less bureaucratic and more effective. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>At the Conference on the Future of the West African

Economic and Monetary Union, WAEMU, organised by the Club de Bruxelles

on 21 and 22 November, participants have expressed their optimism

over the countries in the sub-region's ability to carry out a

successful economic and monetary union. Blaise Compaore, the President

of Burkina Faso and Chairman of the Summit of Head of States of

the WAEMU said that the present seven signatories to the Treaty

establishing WAEMU in 1994 all had the advantage of maintaining

a single currency the, CFA, long before embarking on economic

integration. Mr Compaore also pointed to the region's recent impressive

economic growth rates which he said augur well for integration.

Mr. Christian Oquet the Head of the Department for West Africa

in the French Ministry of Co-operation added that the time for

integration was right because countries within the region now

had the political will to set up a Union. </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Soubestre Deputy Director of the EC Directorate

General for Development while praising the signatories' efforts

at maintaining a single currency cautioned that a single currency

is a necessary but insufficient condition for economic integration.

He stated that the EU was supporting WAEMU financially as well

as providing advice gained through its long experience with economic

integration. According to Mr. Soubestre the new Lom&eacute; Convention

made special provision for the support of ACP countries engaging

in integration with direct EDF funding to offset losses incurred

by countries attempting to create unions. Mr. Charles Humphries

of the World Bank also expressed his concern over the significant

structural reform in the legal systems, investment codes and tax

legislation and the capacity building of institutions within the

seven members of WAEMU that will have to be put in place to ensure

successful integration. But he emphasised that a healthy political

and economic climate was a more significant incentive to investors

than mere changes in investment codes, pointing to the declining

interest showed to Africa by investors despite attempts to improve

investment codes in the region. Other participants also warned

of the potential political tensions both within and without the

Union over the exclusive Francophone nature of the signatories.

However, the principal speakers at the Conference stated that

at present there is no other way forward for the sub-region but

economic and monetary integration.<BR>

We were getting a bit desperate at ourfailure to conceptualize the necessary parameters when a friendjust back from a UN editing consultancy proposed offering theblueprint for a new office to improve the UN's reputation andsupport its financial infrastructure at the same time -- which,God knows, it could use. Before wrapping and mailing thefinalized idea to Butros and Co., we invite readers in aparticipatory spirit to help us enhance its attractiveness, oreven make it even better. The proposed new facility would be aUN Word Bank.</i><hr>The United Nations is unfortunately not only aninterdisciplinary institution that attempts to deal with theplanet and its problems as One World. It is also a proactivebureaucracy.<p>We all know what that means. The UN might save the world, butno-one would know it because of the parameters of jargonsurrounding so much that it does. Our friend had spent hislatest consultancy hacking away at the bureau-babble that hadinfects the system like a virus. To empower UN writers to shakeoff their gender-related dependency, he devised the Word Bank.It would work like this: On January 1 all UN personal computers(and other physically relevant informational infrastructures)would be installed with the Word Bank programme, makingavailable a fixed number of words chosen for their high jargoncontent. For example, 100 "constraints," 90 "implements", 80"inter alias," 75 "prioritizes" and declining numbers of"enhance," "utilize," "resources," "impacted," "vulnerable,""access," "needs" and so on would be available to users of theword processing programme. As the end of their quota approached,these words would be highlighted on the screen, the computerwould beep rudely as soon as customers of the Word Bank haddrawn an individual word account down to the last five units.Finally the word would not be retrievable at all.<p>To replenish the supply of a used-up unit of jargon, the writerwould have to apply to the Word Bank, giving a personal chargecode. An order of ten more "constraints" at $5 each, forexample, would be filled by deducting $50 from the writer'spaycheck and crediting this amount to a needy UN account, suchas peace-keeping. "Jargonyms", a $50 handbook of alternativesfor words limited by quotas, would be available for purchase byUN offices, the profit also being earmarked for deficitreduction. So here's our first stab at a list drawn from thisarticle:<p>Conceptualize, empower, finalize, gender-related, global,infrastructure, interdisciplinary, optimize, parameter,participatory, proactive, promote, sector, support.We're sure you have more. But watch out: just don't get caughtproactively conceptualizing the interdisciplinaryinfrastructures that will optimize and support global sectorswhose parameters will empower participatory gender-relatedinitiatives in a manner that will finalize grass-roots action ortop-down development. That way lies instant bankruptcy.<p>©Copyright: Crosslines, April 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img src="crosslines_pix/crosslines_logo2.gif"> Crosslines Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<H3>Abstract:<P>

</H3>

This article reviews a recent comprehensive evaluation of the Netherlands bilateral development cooperation with a number of developing countries (in particular India, Mali and Tanzania). Terms of reference of the evaluation report were policy relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of Dutch bilateral aid. The author concludes that this study stresses procedures rather than content (i.c. sectors). She favours a focus on opportunities rather than problems and favours a clear distinction between the aims of economic emancipation and of poverty alleviation.

<P>

<B>Onlangs werd door de Inspectie Ontwikkelingssamenwerking te Velde

(IOV) een evaluatie gepubliceerd over de Nederlandse ontwikkelingssamenwerking

met India, Mali en Tanzania.

Het hoofddoel van de evaluatie was de beoordeling van de beleidsrelevantie,

de doeltreffendheid en de doelmatigheid van de bilaterale hulp.</B>

<P>

<a name=inleiding></a><B>Inleiding</B>

<P>

Belangrijke redenen om een dergelijke studie uit te voeren waren:

het zeer omvangrijke deel van de ontwikkelingsgelden dat via landenprogramma's

wordt gekanaliseerd; de mogelijkheid inzicht te krijgen in de

inzet van een breed scala van beleidsinstrumenten; en het geschikte

kader dat dit type studies biedt om de organisatie en het beheer

van de hulp te beoordelen.

<P>

De vijf centrale vragen waarop het onderzoek zich heeft geconcentreerd

zijn:

<P>

In hoeverre sloot het hulpprogramma aan bij de beleidsprioriteiten

van Nederland en het ontvangende land;

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Hoe was dit hulpprogramma tussen Nederland en het ontwikkelingsland

georganiseerd en hoe werd het beheerd (doelmatigheid van de organisatie

en het beheer);

<P>

<LI>In welke mate droeg de Nederlandse hulp bij aan de economische

verzelfstandiging;

<P>

<LI>In welke mate droeg de Nederlandse hulp bij aan de armoedebestrijding;

en

<P>

<LI>Hoe duurzaam zijn de resultaten van de Nederlandse hulp gebleken?

</UL>

<P>

De hoofdbevindingen van de landenevaluatie zijn gepubliceerd in

drie landenstudies en een samenvattend rapport. Het samenvattende

deel begint met een korte schets van de drie landen als achtergrond

voor de bevindingen over de Nederlandse hulp. Daarin wordt in

het bijzonder aandacht gegeven aan de sociaaleconomische situatie

en het overheidsbeleid. Vervolgens worden de hoofdbevindingen

gepresenteerd; deze hebben achtereenvolgens betrekking op beleidsori&euml;ntatie,

organisatie en beheer van de hulp, de bijdrage van het hulpprogramma

aan economische verzelfstandiging en armoedebestrijding in de

drie landen, en de duurzaamheid van de projectresultaten. Het

geheel wordt afgesloten met conclusies over de beleidsmatigheid,

doeltreffendheid en doelmatigheid van de hulp, en met aanbevelingen

over het landenallocatiesysteem, de hulpaanpak en het hulpbeheer.

<P>

De IOVlandenstudies zullen worden gebruikt voor de formulering

van het nieuwe ontwikkelingsbeleid. Volgens het regeerakkoord

van de `paarse coalitie' (zomer 1994) zal wat betreft Ontwikkelingssamenwerking

`de herbezinning mede plaatsvinden naar aanleiding van het recente

rapport van de Inspectie Ontwikkelingssamenwerking te Velde'.

In dit artikel zal &#190; op basis van de hoofdbevindingen van

het rapport &#190; worden getracht een bijdrage te leveren aan

de discussie over de toekomst van ontwikkelingssamenwerking.

<P>

<a name=samenvatting></a><B>Samenvatting van de resultaten</B> 

<P>

Hoewel de IOVstudie benadrukt dat op basis van de uitgevoerde

evaluaties moeilijk algemene aanbevelingen kunnen worden geformuleerd,

worden ten aanzien van toekomstig beleid de volgende richtlijnen

gepresenteerd:

<P>

<UL>

<LI><I>Een meer doorzichtig allocatiebeleid</I>. Om voor de ontvangende

landen de doorzichtigheid en voorspelbaarheid van het Nederlandse

allocatiebeleid te vergroten, is het wenselijk de voornaamste

criteria bij het bepalen van de omvang van de hulp aan de belangrijkste

programmalanden zoveel mogelijk te concretiseren. Men denkt aan

een programmering voor een periode van vier &agrave; vijf jaar

(meerjarenallocatie), waarbij zowel de totale hoogte van de allocatie

als de verdeling naar hulpvormen en hulpinstrumenten is vastgesteld.

Dit bevordert ook een goede integratie van de hulp in de lokale

planning.

</UL>

<P>

<ul>

<li><I>Meer aandacht voor de resultaten</I>. Tot nu toe speelde

de mate waarin programma's succesvol bleken te zijn slechts een

marginale rol bij de bepaling van de omvang van de hulp. De aandacht

voor de resultaten van projecten was relatief gering. De meeste

projecten kenden ook geen deugdelijk systeem van monitoring. Aanbevolen

wordt de aandacht te verschuiven van een te veel op middelen naar

een meer op resultaten gerichte organisatiestructuur. Het totale

hulpvolume dient derhalve vooral te worden bepaald door de <I>output</I>

(de mate waarin het programma succesvol was) en niet zo zeer door

<I>input</I>factoren (de beschikbaarheid van middelen).</ul>

<P>

<ul>

<li><I>Meer programmasteun en minder projecten</I>. In landen met

een goed macroeconomisch beleid is <I>programmahulp</I> (importsteun,

schuldverlichting, structurele of sectorale aanpassingsleningen

en begrotingssteun) de geschiktste hulpvorm. Uit overwegingen

van effectiviteit en beheersbaarheid wordt aanbevolen voorrang

te geven aan sectorgeori&euml;nteerde en procesmatig uitgevoerde

programma's, waarbij diverse hulpvormen worden gecombineerd. Programmahulp

kan &#190; meer dan projecthulp - een belangrijke rol spelen bij

de ondersteuning van economische hervormingsprogramma's. Programmahulp

leidt bovendien tot eenvoudige procedures en tot snelle besteding

van hulpgelden. Gegeven de voordelen van programmasteun wordt

aanbevolen de omvang van de <I>projecthulp</I> en het aantal projecten

te beperken. Er dient te worden gestreefd naar een <I>clustering</I>

van activiteiten, d.w.z. verkleining van de sectorale en geografische

spreiding.</ul>

<P>

<ul>

<li><I>Vergroting van de lokale betrokkenheid</I>. De kans op duurzaamheid

van projecten wordt vergroot indien het ontvangende land en de

lokale uitvoerders het project vanaf het begin als eigen activiteit

beschouwen en zich daarvoor verantwoordelijk voelen. De lokale

betrokkenheid bij de planning en uitvoering van het hulpprogramma

moet dus worden vergroot. Om de zeggenschap van het ontwikkelingsland

(<I>ownership</I>) in de hulpuitvoering te vergroten, dient het

ontwikkelingsland vanaf het eerste begin te worden betrokken bij

de identificatie van projecten. Hiervoor is het nodig dat hulpprocedures

worden vereenvoudigd en geharmoniseerd, terwijl ondersteuning

dient te worden gegeven aan de lokale <I>management</I>capaciteit

en lokale beheerssystemen; de belangrijkste oorzaak van het gebrek

aan `kennisoverdracht' door deskundigen aan lokale <I>counterparts</I>

vormen het zeer lage salaris en het lage kennisniveau ter plaatse.</ul>

<P>

<ul>

<li><I>Meer joint-co-financing</I>. Volgens de studie moet de toepassing

van <I>joint-co-financing</I> als gunstige ontwikkeling worden beschouwd:

door gezamenlijke financiering wordt de <I>impact</I> van hulp

vergroot, vooral met betrekking tot macroeconomische hervormingsprogramma's;

deze hulp is voor ontwikkelingslanden beter te hanteren, omdat

ze maar met &eacute;&eacute;n uitvoeringsprocedure en &eacute;&eacute;n

controlemechanisme te maken hebben. Bovendien vermindert hierdoor

de werkbelasting voor het DGIS.</ul>

<P>

<ul>

<li><I>Grotere delegering van bevoegdheden naar ambassades</I>.

De verdere delegering van bevoegdheden naar de ambassades is gebaseerd

op het idee dat kennis van de lokale omstandigheden vooral in

het land zelf moet worden gezocht. Daarom verdient het &#190;

volgens de evaluatie &#190; aanbeveling de verantwoordelijkheid

voor identificatie, formulering en beoordeling van de programma's

en de <I>monitoring</I> van de uitvoering aan de ambassades over

te laten. Een dergelijke delegering sluit niet uit dat bij de

voorbereiding en uitvoering specifieke buitenlandse expertise

wordt ingeschakeld. De ambassade dient dan wel te beschikken over

medewerkers die voor de gedecentraliseerde taken zijn gekwalificeerd.

Daarbij is ook deskundigheid op macroeconomisch terrein een vereiste,

zodat de ambassades effectief kunnen deelnemen aan de discussie

over macroeconomische en sectorale vraagstukken met andere donoren

en met het ontvangende land.</ul>

<P>

<ul>

<li><I>Inschakeling van (lokale) NGO's</I>. Particuliere organisaties

vormen het kanaal bij uitstek voor activiteiten en initiatieven

die zich niet of moeilijk lenen voor samenwerking tussen overheden.

Deze NGO's beschikken over goede contacten met de bevolking in

de ontvangende landen, waardoor zij een goed inzicht hebben in

de mogelijkheden van duurzame armoedebestrijding.</ul>

<P>

Volgens de conclusies van de IOV-studies moet het Nederlandse ontwikkelingsbeleid

dus beter en eenvoudiger. `Doe minder en beter. Doe wat je doet

zorgvuldig en passend binnen de mogelijkheden van het ontwikkelingsland.<a href="#1">(1)</a>

De vraag is echter of met een beter en eenvoudiger ontwikkelingsbeleid

voldoende voorwaarden zijn geschapen voor het behalen van positievere

en duurzamere resultaten. Er kunnen bij de IOVstudie - als discussiebron

voor de toekomstige vorm van ontwikkelingssamenwerking &#190;

immers verscheidene kanttekeningen worden geplaatst.

<P>

<a name=kanttekeningen></a><B>Kanttekeningen</B> 

<P>

In de <I>eerste plaats</I> is het opvallend dat &#190; ondanks

de in de praktijk geconstateerde spanning tussen `economische

verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' &#190; in de evaluatie

geen discussie wordt gevoerd over de vraag of beide doelstellingen

in het vervolg niet beter kunnen worden gescheiden. Nergens wordt

aan de orde gesteld of doorgegaan moet worden met dit `ge&iuml;ntegreerde

beleid', of dat beter overgestapt kan worden op een `tweesporen'beleid.

In het pleidooi voor `programmasteun' (in plaats van projecten)

en `jointcofinancing' wordt vooral gewezen op de mogelijke voordelen

in de uitvoering van economische hervormingsprogramma's. Het is

niet duidelijk in hoeverre via deze kanalen ook een bijdrage geleverd

kan worden aan armoedebestrijding. In de praktijk blijken `economische

verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' slechts zelden samen

te gaan.

<P>

Een <I>tweede thema</I> waaraan in de evaluatie weinig aandacht

wordt besteed, vormt de tegenstelling in ontwikkelingslanden tussen

`nationale' en `lokale' belangen. In de IOVstudie wordt er stilzwijgend

van uitgegaan dat `wat goed is voor de overheid' ook in het belang

is van de bevolking. De praktijk laat echter zien dat overheden

&#190; ondanks het voeren van een gunstig sociaaleconomisch beleid

&#190; vaak andere prioriteiten hebben dan lokale bevolkingsgroepen.

Voor zover in de IOVstudie wordt ingegaan op de noodzaak te komen

tot `vergroting van de lokale betrokkenheid', wordt slechts gerefereerd

aan betere participatie van de overheid in de planning en uitvoering

van het hulpprogramma en `ownership' van het programma. In de

beoordeling van de doeltreffendheid en doelmatigheid van Nederlandse

hulp is nergens een poging gedaan inzicht te krijgen in het gezichtspunt

van de bevolking.

<P>

Behalve deze tekortkomingen in de <I>analyse</I> kunnen ook bij

de <I>conclusies</I> kritische kanttekeningen worden geplaatst.

Het is niet altijd duidelijk waarom met de voorgestelde wijzigingen

een directe bijdrage zou kunnen worden geleverd aan een doeltreffender

en doelmatiger ontwikkelingsbeleid.

<P>

<ul>

<li>Met programmasteun (in plaats van projecthulp) lijkt weliswaar

een bijdrage te kunnen worden geleverd aan een grotere `doorzichtigheid',

maar daarmee is nog niet duidelijk waarom hiermee per definitie

gunstiger resultaten zijn te behalen. De lokale uitvoeringscapaciteit

is vaak klein, en er zullen zich &#190; vooral in de meest marginale

gebieden &#190; hoe dan ook problemen voordoen in de uitvoering.

De voorkeur voor programmasteun of projectmatige aanpak hangt

trouwens in hoge mate af van de beoogde doelstelling: waar het

gaat om `ge&iuml;ntegreerde streekontwikkeling' (met gebiedspecifieke

doelstellingen) lijkt projecthulp een doelmatiger en doeltreffender

instrument dan programmahulp. Overigens wordt in het pleidooi

voor programmasteun nergens verwezen naar de negatieve ervaringen

die in voorgaande perioden zijn opgedaan met betalingsbalans en

importsteun.<a href="#2">(2)</a></ul>

<P>

<ul>

<li>Het is opvallend dat in de IOV-studie blindelings de voorkeur

wordt gegeven aan hulp `in eigen beheer', zonder duidelijke conclusies

te trekken uit de ervaringen met <I>uitbesteding</I>. Oorspronkelijk

was de voorkeur voor uitbesteding vooral gebaseerd op drie te

verwachten voordelen: kwaliteitsverbetering, vermaatschappelijking

en werklastvermindering. De praktijk laat zien dat veel van de

uitbestede projecten tot goede resultaten hebben geleid. Toch

wordt `eigen beheer' in de IOVstudie weer gezien als de meest

geschikte modaliteit voor de uitvoering van projecten. Het is

niet duidelijk waarop deze mening is gestoeld en waarom projecten

`in eigen beheer' tot betere resultaten zouden leiden.</ul>

<P>

<ul>

<li>Het lijkt niet terecht dat in de IOVstudie wordt gepleit voor

een `delegatie van bevoegdheden naar de ambassades' en een `toename

van het aantal lokale sectorspecialisten', zonder dat wordt ingegaan

op hierdoor toenemende financi&euml;le lasten. Terwijl de permanente

stationering van buitenlandse deskundigen in projecten op financi&euml;le

gronden als ongewenst van de hand wordt gewezen, volgt in het

pleidooi voor `decentralisatie van DGIS' geen afweging van kosten

en baten. Weliswaar kan door gespecialiseerd personeel op ambassades

een positieve rol worden vervuld in de uitvoering van projecten,

maar het is niet duidelijk hoe kwaliteit en continu&iuml;teit

kunnen worden gegarandeerd. Regelmatige roulatie van taken en

overplaatsing is op ambassades een normaal patroon; zolang het

vertrek van (sommige) sectorspecialisten niet als `verlies', maar

veeleer als `opluchting' wordt ervaren, lijkt een discussie over

verdere decentralisatie voorbarig. Voorlopig lijkt het van groter

belang dat op ambassades prioriteit wordt gegeven aan de opbouw

van een `institutioneel geheugen'.</ul>

<P>

Behalve genoemde bezwaren is het opvallend dat de IOV-studie geen

aanzet geeft voor beleidswijzigingen die inspelen op recente tendensen;

ondanks de groeiende rol van de particuliere sector wordt in de

IOVstudie eenzijdig gesproken over hulpverlening via overheden

en NGO's; nergens wordt ingegaan op een mogelijke kanalisering

van middelen via het <I>particuliere bedrijfsleven</I>. Bovendien

wordt weinig aandacht besteed aan de vraag op welke wijze in de

toekomst ondersteuning kan worden verleend aan de groeiende sector

van <I>informele</I> (handels en produktie)activiteiten. Vooralsnog

lijkt programmahulp niet het meest geschikte kanaal voor het stimuleren

van particulier initiatief, vooral niet in landen waar het grootste

deel van de beroepsbevolking is geconcentreerd in de informele

sector.

<P>

<a name=evaluatie></a><B>Evaluatie van evaluatie</B> 

<P>

De IOV-studie geeft weliswaar inzicht in de voor- en nadelen van

het gebruik van verschillende hulpkanalen, maar voor het richting

geven aan toekomstig ontwikkelingsbeleid worden weinig nieuwe

aanzetten gegeven. In de studie wordt nadruk gelegd op de <I>vorm</I>

waarin ontwikkelingshulp moet worden gegeven, terwijl weinig aandacht

wordt besteed aan de <I>inhoud</I> van projecten. Vooral waar

het gaat over de duurzaamheid van projecten wordt slechts ingegaan

op de organisatorische en logistieke kant van projectuitvoering,

terwijl het succes &#190; in de praktijk &#190; in hoge mate wordt

bepaald door inhoudelijke zaken.

<P>

Terwijl in de IOVstudie tegenvallende resultaten worden verklaard

door `bestuurskundig falen', had evengoed de conclusie kunnen

zijn dat het DGIS heeft gegokt op de verkeerde sectoren. In Tanzania,

Mali en India was het beleid vooral gericht op de rehabilitatie

van de meer `traditionele' sectoren (voedsellandbouw; agroindustrie;

infrastructuur; drinkwater en sanitatie), waarbij de bestaande

situatie (d.w.z. de lokale problemen) zoveel mogelijk als uitgangspunt

wordt gehanteerd. De Nederlandse middelen zijn dus vooral ge&iuml;nvesteerd

in de economisch minder aantrekkelijke sectoren, waarbij bovendien

veel nadruk werd gelegd op agroecologische en technische factoren.

<P>

Een belangrijke reden waarom veel ontwikkelingsprojecten niet

tot duurzame ontwikkeling hebben geleid, komt dus niet zozeer

door de gebrekkige projectuitvoering en de problemen daarbij,

maar veeleer doordat in de keuze van sectoren onvoldoende rekening

is gehouden met toekomstig potentieel en te verwachten groeimogelijkheden.

In Tanzania, Mali en India waren vrijwel alle ontwikkelingsprojecten

gericht op stagnerende sectoren, met `gebrek aan dynamiek'. Terwijl

de doeltreffendheid, doelmatigheid en duurzaamheid van ontwikkelingshulp

voor een deel afhankelijk zullen zijn van de uitvoeringsmodaliteit,

wordt het uiteindelijk succes sterk bepaald door sectorkeuze en

programmainhoud.

<P>

In de ontwikkelingssamenwerking- `nieuwe stijl' zou &#190; op

basis van de IOVstudie en andere evaluaties gezocht dienen te

worden naar nieuwe uitgangspunten voor beleid, waarbij de doelstellingen

`economische verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' het best

kunnen worden gescheiden. In het kader van `economische verzelfstandiging'

zou &#190; in plaats van ondersteuning van stagnerende sectoren

&#190; juist aansluiting gezocht moeten worden bij de sterkste

&#190; meest dynamische &#190; sectoren van de economie, waarbij

het streven o.a. zou kunnen worden gericht op maximalisatie van

het ontwikkelingseffect (o.a. door vergroting van het aantal begunstigden).

Nieuwe <I>mogelijkheden</I> &#190; en <I>niet</I> problemen &#190;

zouden uitgangspunt moeten vormen van beleid, waarbij niet langer

gezocht wordt naar `aanpassing', maar juist afdwinging van veranderingen.

Voorbeelden van sectoren waaraan door ontwikkelingssamenwerking

tot nu toe weinig aandacht is besteed, zijn de niettraditionele

agroexport, dienstverlening (inclusief toerisme) en handelsactiviteiten.

Ter versterking van de groeisectoren zou (o.a. via programmahulp)

ondersteuning kunnen worden verleend op een aantal voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking

nieuwe terreinen, zoals management &amp; organisatie, bedrijfsadministratie,

personeelsbeleid, marketing, informatica, logistiek en communicatie.

<P>

Gelijktijdig zou via een andere &#190; minder pretentieuze &#190;

lijn doorgegaan kunnen worden met <I>armoedebestrijding</I> 'oude

stijl', waarbij hoogstwaarschijnlijk gebruik gemaakt moet worden

van andere criteria en hulpkanalen. Gegeven de ruimtelijke concentratie

van de armoedeproblematiek (marginale, slecht ontsloten landbouwgebieden,

grote steden) en het gebrekkig kader lijkt in deze gebieden projecthulp

meer voor de hand te liggen dan programmasteun.

<P>

Voor `economische verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' zou

afzonderlijk moeten worden bezien in welke vorm de hulp het beste

kan worden gegoten. De IOVstudie toont duidelijk dat het optimale

hulpkanaal niet bestaat, maar dat de juiste uitvoeringsmodaliteit

(eigen beheer, <I>joint cofinancing</I>, uitbesteding) en de rol

van de ambassade sterk afhankelijk zullen zijn van lokale en macroinstitutionele

omstandigheden.

<P>

Het zou jammer zijn als &#190; naar aanleiding van de IOVstudie

&#190; de discussie over toekomstig ontwikkelingsbeleid voornamelijk

zou worden toegespitst op uitvoeringsmodaliteiten (<I>hoe</I>

moet hulp worden geboden?), zonder dat voldoende aandacht wordt

besteed aan de inhoudelijke kant (<I>wat</I> moet worden gedaan?).

Het doel van ontwikkelingssamenwerking is niet het optimaliseren

van programma en projectadministratie, maar het afdwingen van

sociaaleconomische verbetering voor marginale groepen. De doeltreffendheid,

doelmatigheid en duurzaamheid worden slechts in beperkte mate

bepaald door `vormaspecten' en beheer; het succes van ontwikkelingsprogramma's

en projecten wordt uiteindelijk vooral bepaald door de <I>inhoud

<html><head><title>Women's perspectives on reproductive health and rights </title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img align=left hspace=3 src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo.gif"><h3>International<br>Planned<br>Parenthood<br>Federation</h3><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="ippf_info.html">IPPF</a></i><br clear=left><hr><h1>Women's perspectives on reproductive health and rights</h1><b>by Morag Humble</b><p><img align=right hspace=10 src="ippf_pix/ippf_perspectives.gif">As part of the international movement for women's rights, women have been working hard all over the world for the basic human right to decide the number and spacing of their children.  Exercise of this right requires that women's rights to control their sexuality, and their rights to appropriate contraceptive methods and safe abortion services are respected and protected.<p>While some people narrowly equate reproductive health with concern over the reproductive organs and systems of women and men, many women and women's health advocates view sexual and reproductive health in a more holistic way. It includes both the obvious biological elements of the narrow understanding, but incorporates awareness of the social and cultural contexts in which sexuality, reproduction and child-rearing are carried out. Sexual and reproductive health implies that a woman has the ability to enjoy satisfying and safe sexual relations without fear of infection, pregnancy, coercion or violence; is able to regulate her fertility in the manner of her choosing without unpleasant or dangerous side effects, is able to go through pregnancy and childbirth safely, and has the ability to bear and raise healthy children. Reproductive rights provide the framework in which to achieve reproductive health. Existing family planning programmes cannot simply be redefined as programmes of reproductive health - they need to expand beyond a focus on controlling births.   <h3>The social context of women's sexual and reproductive health</h3>In many countries, a woman is only recognized as the daughter of someone, the wife of another and the mother of her first born. She is not seen as an individual with her own identity, needs, desires and opinions. Right from the time of birth, a differential treatment is accorded to the girl baby. While in many cultures the male child is greeted with much rejoicing, the female child is conversely looked upon as a curse on the family. Girls and boys are brought up differently because of social norms and physical differences. In some countries, girls are either not sent to school or are withdrawn early from school because they have stereotypical domestic roles to fulfil, being "little mother" to younger siblings, fetching water and fuel, and cooking the food. <p>Women play a primary role in economic productivity as farmers and producers beyond the domestic sphere. In addition, their domestic activities sustain the labour force and contribute to the development of the wider economy. However, all too frequently these activities are unrecognised or perceived as secondary. Women who try to move beyond their "traditional" spheres and into the modern labour market often face barriers or penalties, or are channelled into lower status or less secure positions without access to decision-making power. <p>Whilst not all religions are patriarchal in their essence, religious interpretation has often been used to support patriarchal cultural values. An example is the social construction of women's sexuality as a source of evil, controlled through male dominated social structures and rules. Girls are often taught to believe that menstruation is a dirty thing, a pollutant and therefore something to be ashamed of and hidden from others. During menstruation, women may have to sit aside from others, and they are often excluded from religious ceremonies such as praying, fasting, and reading the holy scriptures. Such norms and customs communicate to women a sense of inferiority, and have a negative impact on their perceptions of themselves and their social worth. Often such feelings lead women to have an acute distaste for sexual relations which they think of as repulsive and sinful. <p>Effective reproductive health services need to have an awareness of the broad range of women's reproductive health needs and the contexts within which different needs arise. For example, as a result of poverty or cultural values, women in many societies would never dream of spending meagre family incomes for sanitary towels that would certainly make for better hygiene and easier management of menstruation both within the house as well as at the work place. Using dirty rags leads to infections and great hardship to women who work long and hard hours in domestic and agricultural tasks. However issues such as effective care of menstruation are rarely dealt with by traditional family planning programmes and services. <p>Men and women are taught to have different attitudes towards sex and sexual needs, and society accords them different amounts of freedom and power in getting their sexual needs met. Women are socialised to give priority to meeting the demands of their husband, hence women's own sexual pleasure and satisfaction are often not recognized as equally valuable and important aspects of sexuality.<h3>Motherhood and women's needs</h3>As society places a great deal of value on women in the role of mothers, pregnancy and child birth are focal and important parts of many women's lives. Motherhood is perceived as a blessed state through which women earn societal recognition and protection as well as a sense of personal identity and fulfilment. As a basic right and because of society's perception of motherhood, access to services to ensure safe delivery is an essential core of any reproductive health service. <p>However, an important question is whether women's total sexual and reproductive health needs are currently being met within established health systems. In most countries they clearly are not. Statistical evidence on maternal morbidity, unsafe abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including AIDS, demonstrates this. However, while the need for expanded services is clearly demonstrable, the "any programme is better than none" approach results all too often in empty clinics or dissatisfied clients because women are not consulted about their needs in a comprehensive and unpatronizing way. <p>For women's reproductive health needs to be adequately and effectively met, they require an environment and approach to health care delivery which offers choices to those using the services which are responsive to their physical, emotional and medical needs. Women often undergo considerable trauma during childbirth, which can be particularly intense in cultures which exercise a strong preference for male children. In this context giving birth to a boy enhances a woman's status in the family giving her a certain amount of power, whilst giving birth only to female children can have a very detrimental impact on her position and status.<p>Once childbirth is over, women take upon themselves primary responsibility for bringing up their children - this is still the case where women have entered the labour market. The expanding roles women have to shoulder often have the effect of increasing pressure on them to be productive in both the formal economy and domestic spheres. While child bearing is biologically determined, child rearing is not. Unfortunately, the equitable sharing of parental duties is far from being accepted worldwide. <h3>Unmet needs and reproductive health outside child-bearing</h3>Women who consciously decide not to have children are often frowned upon as being selfish and overambitious. For those women who want children and cannot conceive, theirs is an even more difficult existence. Ostracism from society of socalled "barren" women is not uncommon. Their husbands frequently abandon them or take another wife, unjustly leaving them to the erratic charity of the extended family. Invariably women are blamed for infertility, with men refusing to even discuss the issue with a doctor or go for tests themselves. This is also reinforced by attitudes of health service providers who often have the preconceived notion that men will not come for counselling and tests and therefore direct infertility services towards women rather than both partners. <p>Lack of resources and insufficient training and sensitization of health care providers means that women seeking support and treatment often do not receive suitable services. Thus they may be left without appropriate information and support at critical times in their lives. HIV and AIDS, other STDs, pelvic inflammatory disease, and reproductive tract infections are affecting the lives of women the world over. However, the percentage of those actually affected who are seeking help with specific reproductive health problems remains unknown. These problem are aggravated by the lack of appropriate and accessible integrated sexual and reproductive health care services. Often STD services are only provided by STD clinics situated in large hospitals, and these usually only provide diagnosis and treatment of the STD without adequate counselling on sexual health concerns. The problems of little privacy, judgemental attitudes of service providers and the stigma attached to these services makes them very inaccessible to many people, particularly adolescents. Women are unlikely to use these clinics, taking their problems to the gynaecological departments if they seek help at all.<p>It is common for women's reproductive health needs to be trivialized or even, in extreme cases, falsely labelled as mental health problems. Health care systems have been controlled by male physicians who perceive reproductive health purely in terms of the medicalized problems of women. In order to meet the range of women's sexual and reproductive health needs, services must be provided in a broader context than the dominant medical model. <h3>Reproductive rights as human rights</h3>Women's rights are a part of the human rights conventions, therefore instruments requiring government accountability on reproductive rights are already in existence. The strongest of these is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights also states: "The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights".<p>Human rights relating to family planning must address the rights of both partners and emphasize equality and partnership in decision making and responsibility. Furthermore, the sexual health of both partners is severely affected by lack of information and services, particularly as regards STDs. However, whilst partnership is paramount, it is still the health and lives of women that are directly affected by lack of access to reproductive health care, as they bear the brunt of unsafe abortion, unsafe deliveries, and inappropriate contraceptive methods. The right of a woman over her own body and security of person has to be recognized and observed as a paramount right of the individual.<p>Another aspect of the human rights issue is the debate over legally imposed contraception for handicapped or `defaulting' mothers and the right of the state over and above that of the individual to make this decision. Is it justifiable to impose contraception on a woman because she is mentally handicapped?. Attempts have been made to sterilize a mother who has abandoned her children, when it is the underlying cause of her behaviour which needs to be addressed. Poor women on social assistance in developed countries are also being pressured by the state to accept long-term contraceptive methods or have their support reduced. <h3>Women and population policies</h3>At this time, most countries of the world enforce policies and legislation concerning access to modern methods of fertility management and control. The official discourse on population invariably holds women responsible for what is popularly called the 'population crisis' or the 'population explosion'. Women as procreators are held responsible for the poverty of families, depletion of natural resources and degradation of the environment.<p>National population policies have an impact on the range of reproductive choices open to women. Their personal desires for childbearing may come into conflict with a policy presented as for the national good, whether pro- or anti-natalist. Yet under circumstances where many women are denied access to the basic resources available in the national economy, it appears as a gross injustice to demand that these women place the lofty ideal of the good of the nation over and above their individual and family needs.<p>The issue of reproductive rights crystallizes sharply the implication of patriarchal power for women's life choices. Women's control over their own bodies is critical to their own selfhood. The population establishment appears to emphasize the need for fertility reduction as a route to poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability. Women's groups themselves seem to have differing views. While most women's advocates are unlikely to subscribe to the causal interlinking of poverty and environmental degradation on the one hand and population control on the other, many do acknowledge that the decision to bear or not bear children will have profound social implications. As one group of Third World feminists state "women know that child bearing is a social and not a purely personal phenomenon, nor do we deny that world population trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions by the end of the century", but they go on to stress that unless women's bodies cease to be treated as pawns in the struggle amongst states, religions, male heads of households and private corporations, and unless women's needs and interests are taken into account, population programmes are unlikely to succeed.1<p>Unfortunately family planning programmes in many countries are dominated by the official imperatives of population control rather than women's need for reproductive choices. If feminist interpretations of women's needs were adopted, the provision of reproductive technology would be geared to enhancing women's choices and health and supporting their reproductive rights. The fact that bearers and carers of children, women, have a particular stake in the conceptualization, formulation and implementation of family planning programmes must by recognized. Women's health advocates call for these programmes to take a qualitative, reproductive health care approach rather than a quantitative approach based on targets, quotas and control.<h3>Continuing concerns</h3>A basic dilemma facing women's health advocates is how women's reproductive rights can be guaranteed in the context of the harsh realities that exist in a majority of developing countries. Clearly the reproductive health framework demands a fundamental change in the current health system which requires political will and commitment. <p>There is also a dilemma in the field of contraceptive technology. The user-controlled technologies which many women's health advocates are propagating are still associated with relatively high levels of failure, and very few of the methods currently available are delivered through systems which emphasize equality and responsibility of both partners. It is important to question to what extent women in different social and cultural contexts favour user-controlled or provider-controlled methods. There is further concern over how the inadequacy and failure of different contraceptive methods can be dealt with in situations in which abortion is illegal and access to safe abortion services denied. These concerns present important challenges to service providers.<h3>Conclusion</h3>When trying to control their fertility women are confronted with many power relations: between men and women, between health providers and clients, and between the state and its people. The issues related to the conduct of family planning programmes and the nature of contraceptive technologies have much to do with women's access to formal mechanisms of power. To guarantee women's free and informed choice of contraceptive technologies, it is these power relations that need to be addressed even more than the manner in which family planning programmes are conducted or the nature of contraceptive technologies used.<p>In the light of the various controversies, all those working in the fields of reproductive health and rights should make a point of listening to women's views and the voices of their advocates. FPAs have committed themselves to action in support of women's empowerment through Vision 2000. We have to gather our strengths, look beyond our differences and act together. Women are not looking for sympathy, but for recognition of their equal rights. <p><hr width=60%><p><i>Morag Humble is Research Officer, Women's Unit, at IPPF Central Office. <br>This article is an edited version of a discussion paper prepared for a joint meeting of IPPF's International Women's and International Programme Advisory Panels.</i><p> <hr><p>©Copyright IPPF 1995.<br><font size=-1>Picture: &copy;Mark Edwards/IPPF</font><hr><img src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo2.gif"> <a href="index.html">IPPF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<html><head><title>Unicef  - Children First: Issue 32, A market in innocence</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#333366" vlink="#3399ff" text="#000000"><img src="../unicef_pix/unicef_logo.gif"><hr><h2 align=center>A market in innocence</h2>FLIP through the travel brochures for the latest &quot;exotic&quot; holiday destinations, and you will surely see pictures of smiling, carefree children on beaches, in parks, alongside temples and castles. They are there spreading the feel-good factor. Yet in these same countries childhood for an increasing number of children is anything but carefree. Behind the endearing facade is an ever-growing international trade: in child prostitution; in the abuse of street children; of kids being bought to feature in pornographic films and magazines; and the trafficking of young girls.<p>The criminal nature of this trade in children's bodies makes it difficult to collect accurate data on the number of children involved. But what is known, is that it is a multi-billion dollar trade that, from Asia to Africa draws in one million children every year. And it's not just happening in developing countries: reports are showing a growing number of children - boys and girls - trading their bodies on the streets of Europe as a means of survival. And the age of the children involved is dropping: children as young as five are being treated like commodities - taken from their homes and families to work in brothels, massage parlours, clubs and bars, or as private playthings of those who buy them like goods in a supermarket. <p>The reality of this trade is powerless children forced to service whoever is presented to them, in whatever way required. Christine Beddoe from ECPAT (the End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism campaign) says that this often involves &quot;children being forced to take part in sadistic acts, group sex and all kinds of perversion.&quot; It's the daily degradation of the nine-year-old Indian girl sold to a &quot;Bombay Man&quot;, who commands her to put on lipstick each afternoon and service the steady supply of men sent into the dark room where she was kept. It's the ordeal of street boys, caught up in the dealings of men like Freddy Peat who, for years, lived in Goa posing as a doctor and imprisoning the boys he befriended, using them for every kind of cruel and perverted sexual act he could dream up.<p><center><hr width=71%><p><font size=4 color=blue>Half of all child prostitutes are estimated to be HIV positive</font><p><hr width=71%></center><p>It's the unimaginable fear of children who are beaten and tortured if they refuse to comply, and who know they may never see their families again. And it's a death sentence for the estimated 50 per cent of child prostitutes who are HIV positive and will die from AIDS-related illnesses - a hideous irony when the demand for sex with children is growing because of a mistaken belief that they will be free of the virus. <p>Finally the world has woken up to this gross violation of children's rights. In August the first ever World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children will be hosted by the Swedish government. Organised by UNICEF, ECPAT and the NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it is, says Amihan Abueva, Executive Director of ECPAT, &quot;a vital opportunity for the world to start doing something about this dreadful trade. Almost every country in the world has signed the UN Convention, a commitment to protect children globally, but what is happening makes a farce of that promise.&quot;<p><table align=left width=150><tr><td><img hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 width=128 height=145 src="pg14.jpg"></td><tr><td><font size=2>Pensri holds up a dress made by one of the girls from the Daughters' Education Programme. Educating girls and giving them the skills they need to earn a living is one of the most effective ways to stop them becoming involved in the sex industry.&copy;Olly Hoeben</font></td></tr></table><br>The causes of this trade are as diverse as the children trapped in it, and include the massive income differences between rich and poor, urbanisation, the breakup of the family, and gender discrimination. The pressures of tourism have also had a major impact on developing countries as they try to make the changes necessary to cater for tourists. Many countries have seen well-observed value systems breaking down through contact with foreign visitors. And while plenty of tourists really do travel for wonderful beaches, reliable sun and the pleasure of meeting people from different cultures, a chilling number also see the opportunity they could not have at home. It is something Dr Kitija Phornsadja, Project Director for UNICEF in Bangkok, who has made fighting child sexual exploitation her priority, has seen very clearly. She says: &quot;It is as though these men (almost 100% of sex tourists are men), a lot of whom come from the West, believe they are entitled to come and buy whatever they want in a poor country and that the children should be grateful because they get some money.&quot;<p>In Thailand they have made a commitment to get tough with the sex tourists and the Thai men who use child prostitutes: very long prison sentences are being introduced - an English paedophile recently got a 50 year prison sentence; and policewomen are being trained to find child prostitutes and help them. Just as importantly, concerted efforts are being made to get at the procurers. But in the end, Phornsadja points out: &quot;The most effective thing would be if the children can be protected from ever being drawn into the industry.&quot;<p>That was the view of Sompop Chantaker who, in 1991, started the inspirational &quot;Daughters' Education Pro- gramme&quot;. He had seen how many girls in Thailand's northern villages including his own, Mae Sai, were being taken to work in the cities by agents' who persuaded their families they would have a glamorous career' and earn money on a scale unimaginable in their home villages. <p><center><hr width=71%><p><font size=4 color=blue>&quot;We told them what really happens to their children when they are sold&quot;</font><p><hr width=71%></center><p>Chantaker knew that the only way of changing things was by presenting an alternative for these girls. With the help of UNICEF, he raised money for scholarships to cover secondary education for the girls, and training in skills and crafts with which they would be able to earn a living. The scholarships were to be offered to girls who local teachers, priests and village leaders identified as most at risk of being sold into prostitution. Parents were approached and, explains Chantaker: &quot;We told them what really happens to their children when they are sold. But we also had to help them see that if their girls came to us they would have a means of earning when they finished - because families are desperately poor in these places and it is a tradition for daughters to go to work and support them.&quot;<p>The DEP started out with just 19 girls involved in a programme that includes consciousness raising and work designed to build self-esteem, helping them challenge some of the ideas about having to be passive and obedient as women. After initial reluctance, families have grown more and more enthusiastic and 300 girls are now enrolled in the programme. The families are offered small, low-interest loans and help with developing crop-growing or small businesses, and they have seen that they need not lose their daughters. <p><table align=right width=140><tr><td><img hspace=10 vspace=10 width=119 height=100 border=1 src="pg15.jpg"></td><tr><td><font size=2>Thailand's policewomen are playing their part in the fight to tackle the sex trade: they are trained to find, and help, child prostitutes.&copy;Olly Hoeben</font></td></tr></table><br>Pensri Mia Pow, 19, was one of the first girls to join the programme seven years ago. She says; &quot;My sister went into sex work and it was very sad. I did not want to go, and I was very lucky because somebody working with DEP came and offered me this opportunity. Now I am training to be a teacher, and I am a leader which means I work with younger girls here and I go out into the community and talk to young girls there. I believe it is possible to change things so that girls like my sister do not feel there is no alternative but go to work as prostitutes.&quot;<p>The idea of education as the best form of prevention has also taken up by the Pan Pacific Hotel in Bangkok, who have joined with UNICEF to launch a Youth Career Development Programme, which offers at risk girls the opportunity of a 20-week training course in all aspects of hotel work. This year five more hotels, including the Sheraton Grand in Bangkok, have joined the scheme. Phornsadja says: &quot;Potentially schemes like this and DEP have the power to radically alter the child prostitution business. If girls are being educated, learning to be strong, so that they are not available for the sex industry then that will stop it more effectively than anything.&quot;<p>These are inspirational schemes, but what is needed is an international effort to stop this gross violation of children's basic human rights. If we do not act now then we are condemning another generation to a cycle of exploitation.<p> <hr>©Copyright: UNICEF 1996<hr><center><SMALL><b> [<ahref="../index.html" target="_parent"> UNICEF Home Page</A>] [<ahref="http://www.childrenfirst.org">Support UNICEF</A>] [<ahref="../news.html">News</A>] [<ahref="../events.html">Events</A>] [<ahref="../publications.html">Publications</A>] [<ahref="../education.html">Education</A>]</font></SMALL></b></center></body></html>

<h2>Baroness Chalker to attend Women's Summit <br>in Peking</h2><p>

<i>Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development, confirmed today that she will be attending the fourth World Conference on Women in Peking in September.</i><p>
<hr>
Speaking to a specially invited audience of academics, parliamentarians and representatives of non governmental organisations to mark International Women's Day, Lady Chalker said:  "It is vital we improve the role and status of women in developing countries.  I hope the Peking conference will build on the valuable work achieved at the Cairo Conference on Population where we affirmed the fundamental connection between women's rights and sustainable development.<P>
"I will be taking up this theme at the Social Summit at Copenhagen this weekend.  I will stress the need for women to take greater control of their lives and improved well-being - and how vital it is that men work in partnership with them to do so."<P>
Lady Chalker went on to outline some of the projects that have helped women:
<ul>
<li>Domestic water supply projects, with stand-pipes positioned where women want them, so that they do not have to walk long distances.  For example, in the project the ODA is supporting in remote communities in Nepal through the Ghurka Welfare Trust.<P>
<li>Assistance to help women participate in village development committees, open bank accounts, learn to read and write and ride bicycles.<P>
<li>Support to women politicians and administrators to influence policy in favour of women generally.   For example, the ODA funds a Women in Public Life project in Ghana.<P>
<li>Women also need assistance to cope with disaster and conflict as emergency aid has not always been sufficiently conscious of women's, as distinct from men's needs.

<h2>Do Actions Speak Louder than Words?</h2>
<p>
<i><b>Teresa Garlake</b> of Oxfam's Young People Team and <b>Alison Norris</b> of Oxford DEC look at the ExChange project at ODEC and see  links between education and action in the work of Paolo Freire and Augusto Boal. From this exploration other tensions are raised that the Development Education movement must face.</i>
<hr>
In the last twenty years the Development Education movement has devised a range of creative techniques for helping people (mainly teachers and students) cut through the racism and ignorance which colours our view of the South.  This is an achievement to be proud of.  But is it enough?  Or is David Hicks' assertion that  "understanding without action is equal to ivory-towered impotence" correct?  How many of those school students have got involved in developing their own society, or in any action which supports people trying to change other societies?  Is the best that the Development Education movement can offer in response to such a question the uncritical hope that a particular Development Education experience has made people more likely to act.  If Development Education is education for development rather than education about development then hoping that people will act as a result of it is surely not enough. 
<p>
In an attempt to find a way of practising Development Education which is better at involving participants in tackling social issues, the ExChange project draws on the ideas of Southern educators.  A key resource is the work of the Brazilian educator, Paolo Freire.  Freire was influential in the early years of Development Education and his ideas continue to be refined and developed in a wide range of settings.  His cornerstone was the concept of conscientisation which may be defined as: 
<p>
<i>"an awakening of consciousness, the development of a critical awareness of a person's own identity and situation, a reawakening of the capacity to analyse the causes and consequences of one's own situation and to act locally and reflectively to transform that reality."</i>
<p>
For Freire there can be no transformation, or change, without conscientisation.  Put simply, awareness leads in a cyclical fashion to action and then on to reflection on the consequences of that action.  Reflection contributes to a deeper awareness which generates, in turn, further action.  
<p>
The transferring of Freireian methodology from the 'South' to the 'North' gives rise to some basic questions for Development Education, questions which many Development Education Centres (DECs) have been grappling with.  One dilemma is that Freireian methodology is subversive.  It creates an equal relationship between 'students' and 'teachers'.  It exposes unjust social structures.  However, most Development Education practitioners work in the formal sector where schools have a hierarchical structure and exist, some would argue, to reproduce unjust social structures.
<p>
In 1988, Kenneth Baker, then Secretary for Education proclaimed that "the age of egalitarianism is over" and signalled the beginning of a "conservative restoration" in education.  As the market systems tighten their grip on education, schools are encouraged to aim for progress up the league tables at the expense of critical, creative learning.  Given this context, can a Freireian type of education take place in schools at all?
<p>
The issue of the National Curriculum restricting the potential of awareness raising in schools was a question that was raised at an evening meeting between local teachers and a Brazilian Teacher, Jaide Barrieros, who uses Freireian methods in her school.  Jaide replied that she too deals with a National Curriculum.  She teaches two lessons, one to cover the required curriculum and the other a Freireian approach to the same material!  
<p>
If Development Education ignores the formal sector because of the difficulties associated with introducing genuinely radical education, then it loses any chance of influencing a key social institution which has a profound effect on the majority of people in the country.  There is an increasing temptation for Development Education practitioners working in the formal sector to overcome critics by striving for a 'safe' approach which avoids thorny issues and to fit in with the market place requirements that schools are forced to adopt.  As a movement, Development Education needs to consider what compromises are worth making. 
<p>
The informal sector often seems to offer more opportunities for radical Development Education aiming to generate action.  However, this raises different yet equally difficult questions:  
<p>
<ul><li>Few people in the wider community recognise the term Development Education.  It takes time for Development Education practitioners to build up trust with groups that are already working for change.  The Development Education movement needs to recognise that it is not a blank sheet.  It has an agenda shaped by its own values and an interpretation of 'desirable' awareness and change. Agendas may conflict.
<p>
<li>The international perspective is not always perceived as relevant or welcome; to people with immediate and difficult problems it may be overwhelming.  For example, older people have readily accepted that younger people may want to get involved in discussing pension rights because one day they will need pensions themselves.  They seem to be less impressed with vague assertions of the need for a more just world!
<p>
<li>Another fundamental issue is how to act in genuine solidarity with other people. If Development Education practitioners do not fully share the experiences and reality of those with whom they work, what is the basis for partnership?   Pensioners' action groups are interested in pensions and ageism - why are Development Education practitioners interested in that?  Extending this, what gives us the right to raise other people's consciousness?  
</ul><p>
The work of another Southern practitioner, Augusto Boal, provides a further set of tools for tackling the problem of creating a genuine partnership. Known as 'Theatre of the Oppressed', Boal's work was heavily influenced by Freire and began in the midst of the repressive military regime of Brazil in the 1960s.  Whilst touring a revolutionary play amongst the peasants and workers of northern Brazil, Boal recognised that the play was revolutionary only in theory - the middle-class actors were still prescribing reactions to situations which they had never experienced.
<p>
Boal designed a format whereby spectators became 'spec-actors'.  Through storytelling techniques, members of the audience are engaged in finding their own solutions to collective problems.  Whilst the story unfolds, the action may be stopped at any stage to allow the audience to improvise alternative action, thus rehearsing for social change.  All participants in the 'Theatre of the Oppressed' are allowed to experience, through the process, each other's realities - everyone is at some stage experiencing an oppression or being in the position of 'an oppressor'.  People are able to cast aside masks of solidarity and explore together the real issues that confront them all.
<p>
Boal's techniques have inspired practitioners in countries as far apart as Burkina Faso, Estonia and Sweden. In Oxford a four day workshop involved a very mixed group of people, including theatre and youth workers, Development Education practitioners, and people involved in Aids support work.  Groups worked on the issues of Aids, racism, sexism and class.  The workshop sparked powerful responses, with many questions being asked about how sharing experiences of oppression allowed groups to overcome it.  The process set up challenging situations which, with further work, could generate action for social change.
<p>
Once the Development Education movement has found an effective way to act in solidarity with other people, another question arises - how far do we go?  Should Development Education workers be on the 'frontline' of change, supporting local groups as they struggle to transform their reality.  Would this give Development Education credibility with the groups it works with?  Or is our role simply to act as 'enablers'? To stay involved beyond a certain point could be to encourage a dependency amongst local groups which smacks of the most ill-thought out of development aid programmes to the 'South'.  Is it more appropriate for practitioners to 'sow the seeds' through raising issues and introducing techniques, then leave it to community groups to get on with the job?  At what stage should Development Education practitioners pull out, if at all?
<p>
The ExChange project, working so far with the techniques of Freire and Boal, has offered a practical way of exploring action for social change.  The process has not delivered easy answers and there is much learning still to do.  Perhaps this question of involvement is an artificial one, which we in Development Education consider because we are used to being involved in other people's struggles.  If the issue really concerns us personally we will not want to give it up.  If it does not make any vital difference to us, why are we involved at all?

Early for the tour, they went for a walk along Sizewell Beach. In front
of them, a little out to sea and resembling the truncated piers of a nineteenth
century holiday resort, were the water in-takes and out-takes for the nuclear
power plant's cooling system. <BR>
<BR>
Just a few yards back from the beach were the two power stations themselves:
Sizewell A, a concrete 1960s building housing an old Magnox reactor due
to have been decommissioned a decade ago. The other, Sizewell B, one of
the world's newest, biggest and most expensive nuclear power installations.
A flagship for the industry, in the process of being sold off to the private
sector, it was painted a tasteful French blue, its white dome gleaming against
the dark grey summer sky. <BR>
<BR>
Gloria and Claire made their way to the Visitors Centre where they were
handed blue hats. 'Small ones for the ladies,' said the matronly woman in
a floral patterned dress who was to be their guide. 'We call this type of
Magnox reactor &quot;the workhorse of the industry&quot;,' she said as they
entered the main hall of Sizewell A. 'It was intended to have a lifetime
of 20 years, but it is so productive and reliable we have kept it going.'<BR>
<BR>
'What would be the cost of decommissioning it?' asked Claire.<BR>
'That's too complicated to go into,' replied the guide, moving quickly on
to explain how fuel-rods worked.<BR>
<BR>
For the tour of Sizewell B they had another guide. Same floral patterned
dress, different woman. This power station was closed for 'routine maintenance
work', they were told. Nearly 900 men had been brought on to the site to
do the work - cleaning out, maintaining, replacing radioactive fuel-rods.
They came from the US, France, and 'all over' and were 'experts', they were
told. <BR>
'Glow boys,' whispered Claire to Gloria. <BR>
'What's that?'<BR>
'Guys who are paid a lot of money to work with radioactive material. They
go around the world doing it.' <BR>
'Records are kept of the radiation dosage of all the people who work in
the power plant,' the guide was explaining. <BR>
<BR>
Claire remembered seeing the records of a man she knew who had worked at
Sizewell before his child was conceived. The baby developed leukaemia. But
according to the records, and the official standard set, the father's dosages
were okay. <BR>
<BR>
'We go over the top on safety,' the guide repeated. 'We are rather proud
of Sizewell B,' she went on, glowing. 'It's unique!'<BR>
<BR>
The station was completed last year. The reactor is a Pressurized Water
Reactor built by the US company Westinghouse - the type used at Three
Mile Island in the US, site of one of the world's better-known nuclear accidents.
<BR>
<BR>
'It's basically the same model but we have improved it. We have used French
computer technology and made it even more safe. There isn't one like it
in the world...'<BR>
<BR>
'And isn't likely to be...' muttered Claire.<BR>
'What's that?' said Gloria.<BR>
'I'll show you later...'<BR>
On the way back Claire asked Gloria what she had thought of the tour. There
was a long pause. <BR>
Then Gloria replied: 'Well, I think they are very keen to promote their
plant.'<BR>
<BR>
Back at the office Claire handed her a magazine article entitled 'Eyeing
the East'. <BR>
'Where's this come from?'<BR>
'The New Internationalist...' <BR>
'Ah..' said Gloria, enigmatically as she began to read: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<table cellpadding=7 bgcolor=#ffcc99 border=1>
<tr><td valign=top>
<font size=2>

<B>EYEING THE EAST</B><BR>
The US company Westinghouse and British Nuclear Electric have lost their
combined bid to sell their model nuclear plant based on Sizewell B to the
Government of Taiwan. It failed to meet that country's procurement and safety
requirements. <BR>
<BR>
This is another blow for the ailing nuclear industry, which has virtually
ground to a halt in the West. It is 18 years since a nuclear reactor has
been ordered in the US, and none are being built in Canada or Australia.
In 1995 the British Government decided there was no economic justification
for public funding for new reactors and two proposed stations were cancelled.
Even 'nuclear-happy' France has no 'new build' at the moment. <BR>
<BR>
Until recently it looked as if Japan were the only industrialized nation
still keen on nuclear power. It provides a third of the country's electricity
and there are plans for another 5 stations in addition to the existing 49.
But the tide of public opinion appears to be turning. With a two-to-one
majority the people of the small town of Maki recently voted against the
construction of a nuclear power plant on their doorstep. Other towns seem
likely to follow suit. <BR>
<BR>
There are three major problems facing the nuclear industry. One is the high
cost of decommissioning power stations when they have reached the end of
their intended lifetime, usually around 20 years. The Yankee Rowe reactor
in Massachusetts, which cost over $186 million to build in 1960, was closed
in 1991. To dismantle the plant fully will cost some US$370 million -
a lot more than it cost to build. Naturally governments and energy companies
favour extending lifetimes rather than footing the massive bill for closure.
<BR>
<BR>
The second obstacle is safety. Chernobyl and Three Mile Island are etched
on the public consciousness and it seems unlikely that confidence will ever
climb back to 1960s and 1970s levels. Nuclear watchers reckon it is only
a matter of time before another large-scale accident occurs, especially
if old outdated plants keep having their lives extended. <BR>
<BR>
Even the newest technologies are failing the safety test. In December 1995
sodium coolant leaked from the Fast Breeder Reactor at Monju, Japan. This
was meant to be the latest state-of-the-art, supposedly safe, technology.
The nuclear industry's attempt to cover up  the full extent of damage did
little to help restore confidence. <BR>
<BR>
Third, there is the growing and seemingly insoluble problem of what to do
with nuclear waste - the 'back-end' of the process as it is rather
graphically described. While this is essential it is hardly a profit-spinner.
The commercial pressure for the industry is to build and sell new power
stations. <BR>
'The future of the nuclear industry depends, in the short term, on exports,'
admits Keith Parker of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, an organization
that represents an international array of nuclear industries.<BR>
<BR>
<B>YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS NUCLEAR </B><BR>
In the 1960s nuclear was touted as a clean, inexhaustible system that would
be so economic to produce it would be 'too cheap to meter'. Nuclear power
now produces 17 per cent of the world's electricity but has not met its
promises on cost by any stretch of the imagination. Even after Chernobyl
a huge amount of public money has been - and continues to be -
pumped into nuclear power. In 1990, according to the International Energy
Agency, $3,936 million was spent on nuclear research and development, of
which $857 million  was for nuclear fusion, compared with just $550 million
for all renewables, including solar, wind and hydro. Nuclear fusion might
or might not come up with a better, safer way of generating nuclear power
than fission, but signs so far are that it will probably cost about ten
times more. <BR>
<BR>
So the main sales pitch today is that nuclear power is good for you because
it's 'clean'. Unlike fossil fuels such as oil, gas and petroleum, it does
not produce the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming and the
greenhouse effect. <BR>
<BR>
The other pitch is 'You need it'. The people who are currently being informed
they 'need it' are the decision-makers in Eastern Europe and Asia. China,
South Korea and Taiwan all have plans to increase their nuclear power programs.
Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines have recently expressed interest.
The company - or increasingly, international consortium - that
brings the best finance package is likely to win the contract.<BR>
<BR>
According to Roger Hayes, Director General of the British Nuclear Industry
Forum: 'There is a tremendous export market for Western companies in countries
like China, Indonesia and Vietnam. All this is driven by population and
industrial growth and increasing energy demand. So despite minor opposition
in some places, they know there is no choice. They have to have nuclear
energy as part of the portfolio.' <BR>

</font>
<BR>

</td><td valign=top>
<font size=2>


People living in Korea and Taiwan might not agree. In these countries public
resistance to nuclear power, and particularly to radioactive dump sites,
continues to mount. <BR>
<BR>
And what about the safety implications of building more nuclear plants in
Asia? <BR>
'China is an issue,' says Hayes. 'They are going hell for leather for nuclear
power and there is a bit of a risk that for pricing reasons they could cut
corners and go for a Soviet reactor at a certain price. But I don't think
safety is going to be a big problem in China. I think a far greater problem
will be if they don't use nuclear. Then they are going to use their coal
and that will be far more polluting. China is already about to take over
from the US as the world's biggest polluter.'<BR>
<BR>
The safety implications for the world of more nuclear power plants in areas
of instability or in countries where there is not what the industry calls
'a safety culture' does not worry Roger Hayes unduly. 'Ours is a dangerous
world. And we will share safety technology with them. There is also training
available.'<BR>
<BR>
<B>TWO MORE CHERNOBYLS</B><BR>
These words may ring somewhat hollow to people living within wind-blowing
distance of Chernobyl. The disaster there on 26 April 1986 unleashed a plague
of cancers and affected, either directly or indirectly, nine million people
in the former Soviet Union. The effects continue. <BR>
According to Anna Syomina, director of MAMA-86, a pressure group set up
by mothers of children with radiation-related sicknesses, as many as 70
per cent of Ukrainian children are born with birth defects and of the 30
per cent born healthy only 20 per cent are still healthy. <BR>
<BR>
'Previously, when my mother's friends came to see her, they laughed a lot
and talked mostly about art and politics,' says Aleksandr Sirota, aged nine
at the time of the accident. 'Later, their conversation was most concerned
with their children's illnesses and with grief in their families and the
families of their friends and acquaintances.'<BR>
<BR>
The financial cost of the accident has been estimated at between $283 and
$358 billion, making it the most expensive disaster ever. <BR>
<BR>
But it's right here, in Ukraine, home of Chernobyl, that the nuclear industries
of the West have set their sights. Earlier this year the G7 countries -
Canada, US, UK, France, Germany, Japan and Italy - agreed to fund the
closure of Chernobyl and the completion of two new nuclear plants in Ukraine
- Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 - to replace it. This will cost one
billion dollars. It's deemed the 'least cost' option. <BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists and non-nuclear energy experts are not only concerned
about safety, but also argue that the power is simply not needed. <BR>
<BR>
Ukraine has the dubious accolade of being the most energy-intensive <BR>
country in the world. It uses ten times more energy per capita than Japan
and seven times more than the US. The most simple no-cost, good-housekeeping
energy conservation measures, which have been applied in the West for decades,
would lead to an energy <BR>
<BR>
saving of ten per cent - that is three-per-cent more energy than produced
by Chernobyl. <BR>
The trouble is that by focusing on managing supply rather than demand, energy
over-capacity will only increase and there will be no incentive to move
in the direction of energy efficiency. It would make a lot more sense to
pump the money into new local, energy <BR>
<BR>
efficiency industries, such as making energy-efficient lightbulbs -
something already successful in Poland. Or as the Ukrainian Institute of
Electrodynamics points out, windpower could be developed to provide 40 per
cent of current nuclear output.<BR>
<BR>
<B>DOUBLE STANDARDS</B><BR>
Patching up dubious old Soviet plants is another market contract-hungry
Western nuclear industries are keen to enter. In Mochovce, Slovakia, construction
of a nuclear plant that started in 1984 came to a halt in 1991 due to lack
of finances. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development drew up
plans to complete it. But the Slovak Government ditched them because the
safety requirements were too costly. Instead a consortium consisting of
French Framatome and German Siemens have undertaken to do the work with
a 40-per-cent lower safety budget. What this means, in effect, is that French
and German companies are taking part in a project which will not raise Mochovce
to Western safety standards. Yet the involvement of Western companies will
give the impression that this is being done. <BR>
<BR>
Siemen's nuclear arm needs the work. Since the disaster at Chernobyl no
new power plants have been completed in Germany. Mochovce will provide the
company with a showcase of what it can do for many other nuclear reactors
- and there are some 60 of the same type in Eastern Europe alone.<BR>

<BR>
'Yes, but what do the people in Eastern Europe want?' said Gloria, putting
down the article. 'Or is it just Western environmentalists from Greenpeace
making a fuss...?' <BR>
<BR>
'No, Eastern and Western environmentalists are working together on these
issues. And there have been a number of anti-nuclear protests in Eastern
Europe. There was a big one in Hungary recently to try and stop the dumping
of German nuclear waste in the city of Paks. But the campaign against Mochovce
is one of the most concerted. Let's check the Internet when we get back
and see if there's anything about it,' said Claire. The modem buzzed and
after a brief search the following appeared on the screen, from Juro, a
Slovakian activist. <BR>

Dear Dr. Pierer,<BR>
Siemens' corporate image is being tremendously damaged because of your willingness
to take part in the completion of the Slovak nuclear power plant. It is
obvious that neither your company nor any other is able to upgrade Mochovce's
safety to acceptable standards.<BR>
<BR>
Mochovce would not get a licence to be operated in the EU nor in the USA.
It would be impossible to build Mochovce somewhere in Munchen: do not take
part in a project which could not be acceptable in your country. Drop the
double standards. Mochovce is not the most cost-effective method for the
Slovak energy system. There are many options of cheaper and more environmentally
friendly energy production. By halting your participation in the Mochovce
project, you will contribute enormously to nuclear safety in Slovakia and
Central Europe.<BR>
<BR>
It may be business to you, but it is dirty money you want to earn. I want
to let you know until you halt your participation in the Mochovce project,
I will boycott your products. I will not buy Osram, Siemens Nixdorf, and
Siemens products...<BR>
<BR>
Stop Mochovce!<BR>

'OK,' said Gloria. 'So in Eastern Europe they have surplus capacity and
unsafe nuclear reactors. It's crazy to go on building up nuclear capacity
there. But that's not the case in my country. In South Africa we have eight
million people homeless and 60 per cent of our people have no electricity.
We need houses and we need power - lots of it. And if it has to be
nuclear, many people will say: &quot;so be it&quot;. If nuclear companies
come to us with attractive financing proposals, why should we turn them
down?' <BR>
<BR>
'But do you have to copy our  mistakes?' Claire was becoming quite animated.
'We have been screwing up the environment for 25 years! Huge power stations,
economies of scale that don't exist! Phenomenal wastage in domestic and
industrial use! Estimates vary but if we were using energy wisely we could
be doing the same things with at least 30-per-cent less power than we currently
use!'<BR>
<BR>
'That may be true for you. But what would you say to a rural woman who spends
her day looking for firewood and whose life would be transformed if she
could just hook up to the electricity grid? Or to women I know whose families
suffer from respiratory problems because they rely on coal and kerosene
to heat and light their homes? Look, we want to develop, properly, in a
way that will benefit all the people. We want to electrify the country.
To do that we need power stations. Coal-fired, gas-fired, nuclear-fired
power stations.' <BR>
<BR>
The colour was rising in Claire's cheeks. 'But you have a real window of
opportunity to do things differently! Why close it? You have a program to
build homes for eight million people. You can use energy-efficient models
and methods and so lessen the demands for new power stations. Look,' she
was pulling out a file from her drawer. 'Are you familiar with this study?
It's from the International Institute for Energy Conservation.' A photo
of a rural house with the North-facing wall painted white, and windows of
different sizes depending on their relation to the sun, fell out. 'This
is passive solar-energy heating in rural South Africa. Simple but ingenious,'
she said, picking it up. 'And it saves on fuel bills.'<BR>
<BR>
Gloria laughed. 'It's very nice. I like white walls too. And conservation
sounds good. But we can't conserve what we haven't got.'<BR>
<BR>
'Haven't you got it? You have a lot of power already, and lots of it is
wasted by tremendous energy inefficiencies in South African industry. Your
steel industries, for example, use 50-per-cent more energy per output than
in Western Europe. And you have sun and wind and water, don't you?'<BR>
'Plentifully.'<BR>
'Use those.'<BR>
'Maybe sometime in the next millennium but our deadline is the year 2,000!'<BR>
'But you can leapfrog now! You can go straight to the technologies that
are clean and cheap and renewable. You can go directly to ways of using
energy that are efficient. People are doing it now, in lots of places in
the Third World!'<BR>
'Oh yeah? Show me!'<BR>
Claire sat down at her computer and brought up a file. The answer-machine
was flashing. <BR>
'Oh my God, I forgot. My partner!'<BR>
Gloria laughed, sitting on the edge of Claire's desk.<BR>
'Ah, here it is... one I prepared earlier...' Claire brought up onto a screen
something she been putting together for her students. 'It's not quite finished
yet. I've called it Leapfrogging.'	<BR>

<h2><a href="cartoon.html">Cartoons and Censorship</a></h2>


This is a request for help with research.

<p>I'm a professional cartoonist based in London, and presently studying for an MA in Cartooning at The University of Central England in Birmingham.  For my Programme of Study I'm collecting details on cartoonists who are currently working under difficult circumstances.

<p>The results of the study will be contained in a report which will be made available to pressure groups such as Index on Censorship, Amnesty International and Article 19 in December 1995.

<p>I already have details on the recent censorship of cartoonists in over 20 countries.  I would be very grateful for any information you can offer.

<p>As I can understand that this information can in some cases be highly sensitive, I promise to respect and protect any requests for anonymity.

<h3>FLAGS OF CONVENIENCE SIGNAL SAFETY ALERT</h3>
<i>
A big oil spill off the coast of Britain has focused attention on concern over 
large-scale deregulation in the shipping industry. Tougher international safety 
measures are promised, reports <b>Gemini News Service</b>, amid fears that creaking 
vessels crewed by untrained staff are sailing towards potential disasters all 
over the world.<p>


By <b>JON MITCHELL</b> in Panama City and </b>ALAN MARTIN</b> in London</i><hr><p>

        An oil disaster in western Wales has thrown a spotlight on problems 
linked to a big rise in flag-of-convenience shipping.<p>

        Investigators are trying to establish why the Liberian-flagged tanker 
Sea Empress  ran aground off Milford Haven oil terminal in mid-February, 
spewing 70,000 tonnes of crude into the sea and contaminating a large area of 
sea and coastline.<p>

        Arguments remain over who will pay for the clean-up and compensation 
costs, likely to run to hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>

        As a British newspaper, the Independent, said of the stricken vessel: 
"Built in Spain; owned by a Norwegian; registered in Cyprus; managed from 
Glasgow; chartered by the French; crewed by Russians; flying a Liberian flag; 
carrying an American cargo; and pouring oil on to the Welsh coast. Who takes 
the blame?"<p>

        Investigators have the task of untangling a web of business interests 
spanning three continents.<p>

        There was no indication that the ship or its operators were to blame 
for the oil spill. However, critics of the growing use of flags of convenience 
on merchant ships say they are surprised that maritime disasters do not happen 
more often.<p>

        "We are campaigning for an end to the whole practice of 
flag-of-convenience registries," says Richard Flint, a London-based official of 
the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF).<p>

        The practice of registering under a flag of convenience was begun 
after the Second World War by the North American shipping industry in a quest 
for lower costs and fewer regulations.<p>

        Often based in tax-free havens or countries with less-stringent 
operating standards, registry companies compete to provide owners with access 
to cheaper labour pools and lower taxes and licensing fees.<p>

        The cost of operating a ship from such a country could be 20 to 50 per 
cent less than in the owner's country, says Flint.<p>

        Although the crews are often multinational, they are not necessarily 
from the registry country. <p>

        "Frequently, the captain and first mate will not share the same 
language," says Flint. Such problems, combined with "badly or untrained crews 
and cost-cutting on the part of the ship-owner, can and do lead to disasters.<p>

        "Often ships flying the flags of Panama, the Bahamas and Liberia are 
found by our inspectors to have questionable safety."<p>

        In recent years, the switch to flags of convenience has gathered pace. <p>

Increasing economic liberalisation and the collapse of the Soviet bloc have 
driven more shipping companies - which together move 80 per cent of world trade 
- to deregulate themselves and "flag out" in low-cost havens. East European 
ship-owners are leading the charge.<p>

        By 1994, 30 per cent of the world's fleet had joined a flag of 
convenience, according to Flint. The number is currently rising by about three 
per cent per year.<p>

        "Shipping is notorious for cycles of feast and famine," says Barry 
Everts, a shipping broker for Taipan Shipping in Panama City, referring to the 
unstable nature of the industry.<p>

        "The reasons for flagging out are quite clear to many ship-owners. One 
is avoidance of potentially onerous taxation and the other is a low-cost crew."<p>

        Crews often come from developing nations such as Ghana and the 
Philippines, and are frequently badly treated and poorly paid, says Flint.<p>

        "The policy of employing cheap crews often compromises safety to an 
unacceptable level," he says. "Some seafarers buy into an employment agency, 
bribing an official for a guaranteed job, even though they may have never been 
on a ship in their lives."<p>

        He also argues that there is little economic benefit for the 
flag-of-convenience countries. Often the operations there are no more than 
front companies for registry firms whose real offices are in the United States.<p>

        Another criticism is that many of the ships in these fleets are 
elderly. According to the 1995 figures from the Panamanian Flag Agency, 3,323 
vessels in service and flying Panama's flag were more than 30 years old.<p>

        The ITF has also found flag-of-convenience ships to be twice as likely 
to sink due to age and disrepair than those operated under the national flag of 
the owner.<p>

        This has added to growing concern and has prompted the International 
Maritime Organisation (IMO), a United Nations-funded body, to bring in new 
safety regulations.<p>

        "It isn't game as usual - there is a change coming," says IMO 
Secretary-General William O'Neil. "In the next few years, the plans of the IMO 
should bear fruit. [No longer] is it going to be a simple thing like: 'Register 
with me and you can get away with murder.'"<p>

        Among the changes the IMO is seeking to introduce are mandatory and 
universal training programmes for crews - who would be required to obtain 
recognised qualifications - and regional safety inspectorates to make escaping 
detection harder.<p>

        Under the present system, national port inspectors check for possible 
safety hazards under IMO regulations. Ports have the legal power to impound a 
ship until proper repairs have been undertaken. However, such safeguards can be 
bypassed by corrupt inspectors taking bribes from shipping operators, says Bob 
Veno of the US Bureau of Shipping.<p>

        The process of enforcing new standardised safety procedures is likely 
to be gradual. But until all flag-of-convenience states are brought into line, 
the hazards will remain very real, says Veno.<p>

        "On one ship we inspected recently," he notes, "there was no-one from 
captain to cook who knew how to launch a lifeboat." <p>

<h1>A dastardly business</h1> 

<font size=+1><b><b><i>by Dulue Mbachu</i></b></b></font><p>


Despite protests from western governments on the conduct of the proceedings, the trials of alleged coup plotters continues in secret in Nigeria.<p>


The continuing story of a supposed plot to overthrow Abacha has proved particularly intriguing in recent months. In late February, a number of independent publications reported that some military officers had been arrested on suspicion of subversion. The army information department denied the reports, saying that a few officers were merely being questioned for spreading 'rumours and disaffection'. Shortly afterwards, the military authorities were singing a different tune: a coup plot had indeed been uncovered and 29 officers and civilians were under investigation.<p>

The investigations took an unusually long time by Nigerian standards and, at one point, the London Observer reported that scores of non-commissioned officers had been executed near the capital, Abuja, in connection with the alleged plot - to the vehement denials of the military authorities, whose spokesman decried the story as 'wicked'. Some newspapers even came to the conclusion that there had been no plot at all. Nonetheless, in March, Abacha himself publicly indicted the former head of state, General Olusegun Obasanjo, saying that he was 'personally embarrassed' when security reports indicated Obasanjo's complicity in such 'a dastardly act'.<p>

The trials of the plotters eventually began in a military court on 5 June, when the press was allowed to photograph the handcuffed suspects as they listened to the charges against them but entered no pleas. The trials have since continued in secret and were due to conclude by the end of June. However, reports that Obasanjo has already been sentenced to a lengthy prison term, and other defendants sentenced to death, are being vigorously denied by the government. <p>

Concurrent with the trial, mass arrests and detention without trial, the stock-in-trade of General Sani Abacha's regime, reached a new peak in the run-up to the second anniversary of the annulment of the presidential election of 12 June 1993. Alhaji Wada Nas, Abacha's minister for special duties, raised the spectre of a plot by pro-democracy activists to disturb the peace in commemoration of the election; a few days later, on 31 May, a bomb exploded at an official function killing five people and injuring more than 20 others.
No-one claimed responsibility for the blast, and if the blast was aimed at Mariam Abacha, absent from the function at which she was expected, it failed. But, as if on cue, security operatives swung into action, picking up all known critics of military rule. Among those arrested was Chief Michael Ajasin, the 87-year-old leader of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), along with about 70 of his members. The information minister, Dr Walter Ofonagoro, told the BBC that 'there is nothing democratic in an octogenarian planting bombs.' In the event, however, Ajasin was only accused of holding an illegal meeting and, after spending the night at a police station, was allowed to go home. <p>

Many human rights activists were also hauled in for questioning; some were locked up, others released. On the eve of 12 June, one report claimed that over 200 pro-democracy activists had been arrested in the preceding fortnight. <p>

Nor were journalists spared: Kunle Ajibade, editor of the News, Ben Charles Obi, editor of Weekend Clasique, George Mbah, an assistant editor with Tell magazine, and Chris Anyanwu, publisher of the Sunday Magazine, were all arrested around the same time and are being held at the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI). On 8 June, the attorney-general's office announced the extension for another six months of the proscription of two newspaper houses: the Concord group, owned by Moshood Abiola, the winner of the annulled 1993 elections, and the Punch group. It is generally believed that, when the current proscription of the Guardian newspaper group runs out in August, that will also be extended. <p>

<title>Newsflash 1995 - The situation in Rwanda</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<h2>The crisis in Rwanda and Zaire</h2>

<font size=-1> <br><br>The Kibumba camp near Goma, in Zaire, has been home to Rwandan refugees since the war and genocide last year.  <br>Now they are being deported back to Rwanda<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Photo ©Copyright: Unicef</font><br clear=left>
<h3>Latest update on the situation in Rwanda (updated mid-September)</h3>

<b>The rifts in the Rwandan government cracked open this week, as President Pasteur Bizimungu dismissed the prime minister.</b>
<p>
The government is a coalition of Hutus and the Tutsi-domiated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).  The RPF siezed power last year, ending the genocide by Hutu government soldiers, mobs and militias, in which 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.<p>  

The coalition has come under increasing strain recently, because of objections by Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu to the continuing power of the RPF.  He was concerned that the army did not feel under political control.<p>

Four other government ministers resigned after the prime minister's sacking.  All are members of the Hutu majority.  International observers worry that if the government continues to disintegrate along ethnic lines, renewed fighting might break out.

<p>

<h3>Renewed refugee crisis after Zairean expulsions</h3>

<b>International condemnation followed the decision by Zaire last week to start deporting Rwandan refugees.</b><p>

As some of the camps were beginning to resemble permanent settlements, the Zairean authorities apparently decided on a policy of forced repatriation to end the refugee occupation of border areas.<p>

However, Zairean soldiers carried out the evictions with such brutality that over 100,000 refugees in Uvira fled to hills surrounding the camp, rather than be herded into trucks and driven to the border.<p>

Families were split up as soldiers grabbed people at random.  Hundreds of children were left unaccompanied after their mothers were driven away.<p>

The Zairean government stopped the deportations on 25 August, in response to heavy international pressure.  A UN plan for voluntary repatriations was considered, but later rejected.  <p>

However, many Rwandans in the massive border refugee camps have no reason to return to Rwanda.  Many fear that they will be accused of genocide - of which some are undoubtedly guilty - and thrown into overcrowded prisons.  Others know that their homes will have either of been destroyed or occupied by Tutsis who have returned from exile in Uganda.<p>

Relations between the Rwandan government and the government of Zaire have also been worsening.  Zaire has been giving support to the exiled Hutu army in military-style camps on the border. The army and militias orchestrated last year's genocide, before being driven out of the country by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).<p>

The renewed threat of an invasion by extremist Hutu militias and soldiers is destabilising Rwanda already, by putting the Tutsi-dominated military in a stronger position, and leaving the government in Kigali powerless.  <p>

In Burundi, the Tutsi-dominated army has been waging war against the Hutu majority.  Many Hutus have fled to Zaire, and are joining up with extremist exiles from Rwanda.  <p>

<b>The prospect of stability and regeneration in the region appears once again to be receding.</b>

</H2>
<BR>
Use of <a href="unicef_pix/nnud_9.jpg">Picture 9</a> in small groups would probably produce
a great deal of discussion as items are identified, and their taste and
use in cooking discussed. (Depending on where you live, and the ethnicity
of your pupils, much of the produce illustrated may be completely unknown.)
The picture provides an opportunity to discuss food very broadly - you may
well find that there are some of your pupils who eat virtually no fresh
food at all, for many pulses and spices may be completely new. <BR>
<BR>
You may wish to raise questions of the climatic conditions that different
plants need, seasonal produce in our shops, the importing of foods - who
benefits most from this? (Traidcraft can provide information on Tanzanian
cash crops - see <a href="nnud_resources.html">Resources</a>.)<BR>
<BR>
You might like to ask someone over 40 years of age to talk about the foods
they ate as a child in the 1950s. A comparison of our diets today with that
of the 1950s will clearly highlight how our culinary horizons have broadened
along with increased imports and foreign holidays. The UNICEF resource <B>We
are what we eat</B> provides a full programme of work on eating habits and
food choices. Before doing the work on the Agip Menu you might want to discuss
the variety of 'restaurants' and fast food places where food can be bought
and eaten. Pupils could collect menus and look at advertisements for 'restaurants'
and compare their main features and costs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Spices and global interdependence</B><BR>
Spices provide a perfect opportunity to look at global interdependence since
so few are grown in the UK. A collection of spice jars and packets can be
related to a world map to show how we depend on other countries for this
fragrant addition to our food. Tanzania is renowned for its spices, particularly
cloves which come from Pemba, the second island of Zanzibar.<BR>
<BR>
If you can, purchase a range of foods which come from Tanzania or nearby
African countries. Compare their cost with UK produce and see if the journey
these foods have made can be traced. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Using the Agip menu</B><BR>
The Agip is an international hotel in Dar es Salaam. It is extremely expensive
and many of those who stay there are foreign visitors. However, besides
its restaurant with starched table cloths and shiny cutlery it has a snack-bar
restaurant, which also has a take-away service. This is much used by those
of the local population who can afford it - it is still far more expensive
than you would pay for a meal in a village restaurant which would only offer
a variety of four or five dishes.<BR>
<BR>
1.	Look at the menu closely, what do you notice about the food offered?<BR>
2.	If you spent a day in the Hotel Agip what food and drink would you choose
for meals at 8 am, 1 pm, 6pm?<BR>
3.	Make a bill out for each of these meals and ask two friends to check
your answers.<BR>
4.	List the foods on the menu that you do not recognise. Try to find out
what they are.<BR>

<HR>

<P>

<I>&quot;We must not accept that the poor will always be with

us.  The world has the material and natural resources, the know-how

and the people to make a poverty-free world a reality.  And until

the Social Summit last March, all that was lacking was a global

commitment.  This is more than just a dream.  One hundred sixty

years ago the world launched a crusade against slavery.  Most

people were sceptical.  But there was a will to change.  Today,

I call upon you to launch a similar crusade - for a world without

poverty.&quot;</I>

<P>

James Gustave Speth, Director of the UNDP (January 1996).

<P>

In the last three decades, the well-being of mankind has been

considerably improved in a number of fields.  Infant mortality

has been reduced by half.  The extent of malnutrition has been

reduced by 30 per cent.  And over 60 per cent of people in rural

areas now have safe drinking water, compared with only 10 per

cent in the 1960s.

<P>

These are successes, certainly, but they need to be put into context.

 In 1996, declared by the United Nations as the International

Year for the Eradication of Poverty, 1.9 billion people are living

in poverty.  Every day, their numbers increase by 67 000.  The

global army of poor people is growing by more than 25 million

every year, mainly in developing countries.  All around them and

through the media, they see the new prosperity that is denied

them.

<P>

During the World Summit for Social Development in March 1995 in

Copenhagen, governments made new commitments in the battle against

poverty.  People's basic rights to food, health, education, the

right to be able to support themselves and the right to equal

participation in society were explicitly recognised in Copenhagen.

<P>

To date,  governments have barely drawn the consequences of this.

 Few countries have made these basic rights a central feature

of their policy, which should be aimed at giving poor people the

opportunity to take an active role in their development process.

<P>

To change that, we must do a number of things.  Development aid

is very important, but is only really effective if it is part

of an overall government policy aimed at social development. 

Aid that is actually able to reach the poorest people makes an

important contribution to implementing basic human rights;  The

report &quot;<I>Reality of Aid 1996</I>&quot;, written by a large

number of NGOs from all over the world that deal with aid and

actions to relieve poverty, makes this abundantly clear. The potential

of development aid will only be fully exploited when governments

in the North and the South put human development and the eradication

of poverty at the top of their agenda.

<P>

Secondly, effective emphasis needs to be placed on the people

involved, to obtain their participation.  Development aid projects

that do not properly take account of the opinions and knowledge

of those who are supposed to benefit from the project are doomed

to failure. The 20:20 compact is a step in the right direction.

 The Social Summit in Copenhagen accepted this concept in which

20 per cent of aid and 20 per cent of government expenditure in

developing countries are devoted to investments in social sectors.

 These cover: basic education, primary health care, including

reproductive health care and family planning, nutrition, safe

drinking water and hygiene, and increasing the institutional capacity

to provide these services.  This initiative offers donors and

the recipient countries the opportunity to take responsibility

jointly for a policy of social development.

<P>

&quot;Sustainable development&quot; and &quot;human security&quot;

sound good in statements at Summit Conferences.  But here we are

not talking soundbites:  these concepts must be made central features

of government policies worldwide.  Policy in fields like trade,

debt, defence etc. cannot be treated in isolation from social

development.  The way in which we in the industrialised countries

treat the environment, agriculture and consumption has direct

consequences for poverty in other parts of the world.

<P>

Finally, development aid is a scarce resource and is becoming

even scarcer.  What is even worse is that a significant proportion

of the aid is still tied to projects which have more to do with

commercial or political interests than with the eradication of

poverty.  Aid must reach where the need is greatest.  Thorough

evaluation must identify those programmes that have the required

impact, and then the flow of aid must be channelled in that direction.

<P>

In the past year, a number of positive developments have occurred.

 After the Social Summit in Copenhagen, a meeting was held recently

in Norway where a number of countries discussed the 20:20 compact.

 There appeared to be a broad consensus about fulfilling the objective

of the 20:20 compact.  A number of donors and developing countries

expressed the intention to start using the concept and hold a

follow-up meeting in a maximum of two years to discuss progress.

<P>

The resources for implementing 20:20 will have to come from a

re-allocation of the existing budgets.  The developing countries

will review their national budgets and divert resources to basic

social provisions, and this will also be done at regional and

local level  Extra resources are necessary for this, in view of

the great extent of poverty and indebtedness of these countries.

 The donor nations present agreed to reserve more resources for

basic social provisions and allocated them via the existing aid

channels (aid to programmes and projects) and via multilateral

or private organisations.

<P>

The Oslo Declaration, which was adopted by the meeting, invited

the Development Assistance Committee of OECD (the organisation

of the rich, industrialised countries) to devise further criteria

and set up a reporting system to help the donor countries in re-allocating

their aid expenditure.  This initiative offers possibilities to

reach a policy genuinely aimed at eradicating poverty, provided

that civil society and NGOs are involved in all phases of policy,

from inception to evaluation, and not just in the implementation

phase.

<P>

The Social Summit and the follow-up conference in Norway are important

steps forward.  However, a great deal more is needed to make governments

all over the world shift the emphasis of their policy to the social

sector and the eradication of poverty. The world is standing on

the threshold of a new millennium, in a situation in which one

in every five inhabitants of the planet is born and dies in abject

poverty.  The situation can be combated effectively.  What we

need is the political will to make it the number one priority.

<h3>Creating free and fair societies</h3><p>


As well as sound public administration, lasting development also needs a healthy and flourishing private sector. Aid in support of the private sector in developing countries seeks to encourage measures to liberalise economies, develop capital markets, and provide more incentives to producers. It also provides for specific technical assistance to strengthen businesses. <p>

The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) borrows from ODA in order to provide loans, equity funds and help with management to a broad range of private enterprises in 51 countries. In 1993 it invested £217 million in 100 projects, its largest ever programme. Nearly 90 per cent of new investments were in the private sector. In 1994 Baroness Chalker announced new targets for the next five years under which CDC will concentrate on the poorest countries and promoting the private sector. <p>

Aid for privatisation concentrates on the former Soviet Union and central and eastern Europe with 32 projects costing £11.4 million for mass privatisation programmes and privatisation legislation. These include a project to help the Russians take the first steps in the critical area of land privatisation. But technical assistance and aid was also provided in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The aim is to encourage more dynamic management, foreign investment and better service for consumers.<p>


When David Allan took up his post as adviser to the Inspector General of Police in Namibia, he was in for a surprise. "Modern methods of policing and democratic accountability were unfamiliar territory to some people in Namibia," says David. He had arrived there, sent by the ODA to help reform the police force after the 20 year guerrilla war. As former deputy commandant of the Scottish Police College, responsible for training all of Scotland's police officers and with 32 years in the force, he had the experience necessary to help introduce 250 separate reforms, covering every aspect of policing from CID and special branch to traffic and personnel. "I visited many police stations around the country. Some of them were particularly grand buildings, some little huts and some just a table under a tree."<p>

In 1994, the ODA helped more than 30 countries reform their police services, by upgrading through training the technical and managerial skills of police personnel, for example, and making the police more responsive to the communities they serve. Aid targeted at helping countries build up strong civil police forces in place of military alternatives, is one aspect of the ODA's support for 'good government' in developing countries. Government that is democratic and accountable for its own actions with strong institutions, that weeds out corruption and promotes human rights and has the participation and consent of the people it represents, can make a huge difference to the quality of life.
<p>

The ODA considers good government aspects 
in the design of its aid projects generally. But it specifically promotes good government by funding projects that improve the legal sector, civil service and public services. It also helps support elections, combat corruption and enhance the competence of government institutions.<p>

The ODA's policy involves both penalties and incentives. In recent years, aid to Malawi, Burma and Sudan was cut because of good government concerns, for example, but, in the case of Malawi, was restored in 1993 after the Government of Malawi held a referendum which led to multi-party elections in 1994. 
The Programme for Democracy in Russia, part of the Know How Fund, aims to help with the development of parliamentary democracy through a programme of visits, exchanges and courses.<p>
<b>Reforming for the future</b><br>

Through its support for economic reform in developing countries, the ODA works with governments to help them make sure their country is run in a way that supports their citizens and provides the right environment for economic progress and lasting development. This means governments creating and using sound economic policies which provide stability, a competitive environment, freedom from unnecessary controls and cost-effective public services. Sustainable development is impossible without these policies. Aid for reform comes in the form of balance of payments grants, known as programme aid, which provides finance for essential imports that countries would not otherwise be able to afford, and through technical cooperation. Examples of technical cooperation projects designed to assist in the process of reform  have included, in recent years, eight in Africa and four in Asia all focusing on improving tax administration and revenue collection. In 1994, projects in Malawi, Poland, Uganda, Ukraine, Guyana and Colombia provided assistance and training for civil service reform.<p>

The ODA also helps finance reforms through international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Development Association and the European Development Fund and countries receiving aid have to comply with agreements made with the IMF and the World Bank. This work is particularly important in Africa and 48 per cent of the ODA's programme there has economic reform as its principal objective. Much of Britain's programme aid for reform goes to support the World Bank's Special Programme for Assistance to Africa. The initiative covers 31 developing countries and the ODA focuses mainly on Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania and Ghana. <p>

<b>A boost for business</b><br>
Together, small businesses make a substantial contribution to any country's economic growth and long-term development prospects. The ODA uses aid to bolster small businesses by providing incentives in the form of affordable loans and grants, technical help, start-up assistance, guidance on marketing and capital investment. Since 1990, when it set up the Small Business Development Fund to investigate and promote new projects and activities with these aims in mind, the ODA has steadily stepped up its work in this area. In 1993/94 it 
spent an unprecedented £20 million on these activities.<p>

<b>Know-how </b><br> 
Created in 1989, the Know How Fund is Britain's response to the tumultuous changes in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It aims to support the countries of the region in their transition to pluralist democracy and the market economy. Management training is an important component. Managers in the region were left ill-equipped to cope with new concepts such as supply and demand, consumer choice and energy-efficient or environmentally sound production. To train people to put new systems and policies into action, the ODA has set up a range of projects, including the establishment of four regional management centres in Poland that focus on training and business advice targeted at small and medium enterprises. <p>

In 1993/94 the Know How Fund accounted for 
£59 million. <p>


An administrator at the Rakitnoya sugar factory in Ukraine takes a break, sampling some of the sugar produced on site. Specialised support from the Know How Fund has improved the quality and quantity of sugar produced at Rakitnoya. The Fund has also provided training and technical expertise for the farms - both private and state-run - which supply the plant with sugar beet on a daily basis. <p>


<b>Encouraging enterprise</b><br>
Retreading tyres has become good business for Peter MacManu and a success for the ODA-funded Ghana Enterprise Development Project. In 1985 Peter set up MACAL Tyre Retreading Company in Sekondi, in an old factory with two friends. In 1991 a bank loan helped them buy new equipment, 
but some items were inappropriate and poorly installed. A volunteer from BESO - British Executive Services Overseas which sends senior executives from British industry on short term consultancy assignments - solved the technical problems and trained the staff. Equipment failures are now down 80 per cent to five per cent and the company produces around 100 high quality retreaded truck tyres per week. Peter is typical of thousands of owners of small to medium-sized businesses, probably family-owned and employing a small number of staff, who have benefited from the aid programme.  <p>


Bread queues in Moscow used to be familiar scenes to British television viewers. But the Know How Fund's Moscow Bread project has been working hard to change that. After a study by Andersen Consulting in 1991, a training course in basic business skills for bread shop managers was set up. Nearly 600 retailers were trained. Other retailers now come to their shops to see how they have improved their operations, making them more attractive to consumers - by repainting furniture and rearranging equipment for example. <p>


Small businesses, often based in people's homes, can create opportunities for them to earn much-needed cash and improve their quality of life.

<H1>HOVI <U>H</u>elp Practical Screen</h1>   

<P>Extensive experience with computer training has shown that the best way to

learn a program is by trying things out for oneself. Many of the multimedia

training packages available rely on dummy screens which don't allow the user to

experiment. For this reason understanding and memory retention using these

multimedia packages is often poor.</p> 

<P>The picture below shows a typical HOVI Help practical window which &quot;floats&quot;

on top of the program that is being taught. The practical window can be dragged

around the screen to a convenient location. Once the exercise is completed, the

user clicks on the Back button to return to the

<A href="screen1.html">main screen</a>.</p>

<P>For large <A href="corporat.html">corporate users</a>, practical screens can

you need to put up with the Volcano Coffee Company when your staff want to learn

how to use software for the common day to day tasks in your business. </p>

conventional book this requires struggling through the index or a dictionary to

try and translate what you are reading into plain English. One of the beauties

of an electronic book like HOVI Help is that any complicated term can be

<P>The picture below shows an example of the extensive HOVI Help glossary.

Everything is explained in simple terms and there are often colour pictures to

illustrate the points. One other nice feature is that all terms are

cross-referenced like the example shown below.</p>

<h2>ZIMBABWE: MORE AID FOR DROUGHT RELIEF</h2>

<b>Britain is giving an emergency aid package of around £3 million to Zimbabwe to help tackle drought-related problems, Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development, announced in Harare today.</b> <p>

<hr><p>

The grant will provide 5,000 tonnes of food aid and £2 million in emergency grants to international and non-governmental organisations for food and water supply projects.  This adds to the £500,000 Britain has committed this year for drought relief in Zimbabwe, which has had only 60 per cent of its average rainfall since the beginning of the year.<p>


Lady Chalker also announced an aid grant of £1.38 million towards the supply of 300 Land Rover kits for Zimbabwean authorities with large transport needs, such as the Department of National Parks and Wildlife and the Electricity Supply Authority.  The vehicles will be used to enhance wildlife conservation, combat game poaching and improve efficiency in the electricity and communications sectors. <p>


During her visit Lady Chalker also opened the new Overseas Development Administration office in Harare, which administers the British aid programme in central Africa.  The office has recently tranferred from Lilongwe, in Malawi. <p>


<h3>NOTES FOR EDITORS</h3>

<ul><li>	Lady Chalker is paying an official visit to Zimbabwe from 31 July to 3 August.

<li>	Zimbabwe is one of the leading recipients of British aid in Africa, receiving almost £40 million in 1993/94.  This year Britain has already pledged £10 million in programme aid, contingent on continued progress with economic reform.

<li>	The supply of Land Rover kits is being financed under the Aid and Trade Provision.  The ODA will contribute £1.38 million towards the cost of the £3.9 million deal.  The remaining finance will be backed by ECGD. 120 vehicles will be supplied for use by the Department of National Parks and Wildlife; 145 to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority; 20 to the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation and 15 to the Forestry Commission.</ul><p>

<br><font size=+1>Anuradha 
Vittachi mourns the deaths of the nine Ogoni campaigners - and the international community's lacklustre response.  </font><br clear=left>
<p></b>


<font size=+2>L</font>ike thousands of people all over the world, we have been mourning the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa. And of his eight colleagues: Saturday Dobee, Felix Nuate, Nordu Eawo, Paul Levura, Daniel Gbokoo, Barinem Nubari Kiobel, John Kpuinen and Baribur Bera - their names should not be forgotten because the Saro-Wiwa name has become iconic.
<p><b>
But sadness is not all. There is also widespread anger and shame that so little was done by those in positions of power to put pressure on Nigeria's military ruler, General Sani Abacha. 
<p></b>
Now the British public has taken action in the most decisive way it knows how: by putting ethics before profits and dumping thousands of Shell International shares.  One stockbroker is reported to have received four times the usual number of sell orders last week. Several major British charities, including OneWorld's partner Amnesty International, are also considering what action they can take - without contravening their official requirement to be 'apolitical'. 
<p>
Britain's Church Commissioners, who have an estimated £26 million invested in Shell, say: "We are monitoring the situation closely as we do with all companies where ethics are a worry." Earlier this year, the Commissioners went back on their previous commitment to boycott Nestle products. It may be that the higher political profile of the Ogoni crisis will encourage them to take a different stance this time.
<p>
In the meanwhile, both General Abacha and Shell are protesting their good faith. The General's 'Not in Our Character' campaign has culminated in the launch, last Thursday, of the Sani Abacha Foundation for the promotion of Peace, Unity and the Brotherhood of Man. 
<p>
Shell has taken out full-page advertisements in British newspapers arguing its case. The multinational company has a $4.5 billion Liquified Natural Gas deal with the Nigerian government hanging in the balance - and claims that it wants to stay in Nigeria because that would be better for the people of the Niger Delta.  If it pulled out, Shell says, thousands of Nigerians would suffer through being out of work.  And, it adds, it neither has nor should have the power to influence political decisions.  
<p>
How disingenuous is this stance? One might concede that Shell deserves the benefit of some doubt - if the company could show it had honestly done everything in its power to influence the Nigerian government to show clemency towards the activists before the fateful Friday. 
<p>
But a new report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> newspaper, 19 November, if substantiated, would put paid to this charitable view.  Apparently Ken Saro-Wiwa's younger brother, Dr Owens Wiwa, has told them that a senior Shell official "offered last summer to use the oil giant's influence over the military regime to win freedom for Saro-Wiwa" - but only if the Ogoni leaders made international campaigners stop voicing their protests against Shell's own activities. Dr Wiwa was, understandably enough, shocked at such a cynical bargain. 
<p>
None of this, of course, should distract us from remembering that the authorisation for the executions came from General Abacha, not from Shell. There is no question of 'blaming the West' for the actions of Africans, as one Western commentator has recently complained.  But surely anyone - from West, East, North or South, whether an individual with a few Shell shares or a political or business leader - who is more interested in making a fast buck than in standing up against tyranny is part of the problem.
<p>
One last point: the Saro-Wiwa family has stood up and spoken out. As a result, Kenule Saro-Wiwa is dead. His brother is now in hiding.  Ken Jnr may be in danger. There is a natural tendency for the public to expect both these men to spend the rest of their lives fighting the cause that has become synonymous with the family name.
<p>
But that, in my view, is unfair:  it is another kind of tyranny. The cause for which Ken Saro-Wiwa fought and died was one to which he chose to dedicate his life. If others in the Wiwa family want to take up his mantle for the rest of their lives, too, that must be a decision each one of them takes of their own free will - just as it must be for any individual. And if they come to decide that the loss of one member of the family is sacrifice enough, who are we to demand more?<p>

<title>IRA bomb in London shatters 18-month ceasefire</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">OneWorld News Service<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b><center><h2>IRA bomb in London shatters 18-month ceasefire</h2></center>
<p>
        
 
<b>12 February 1996</b><p>

People in Britain and Ireland were today mourning the end of the Irish Republican Army's 18-month ceasefire.<p>

On Friday 9 February, a huge IRA bomb blast rocked the Docklands area of London, and left the Northern Irish 'peace process' in tatters.<p>

Two people were killed in the explosion, when a newsagent's shop was destroyed.  Several other buildings were badly damaged, and hundreds of businesses saw their offices wrecked.<p>

Security and intelligence forces in Britain warned that more terrorist attacks were probable, as the IRA was expected to begin a new bombing campaign on the British mainland.<p>

British Prime Minister John Major has been heavily criticised by the Irish Government and Irish nationalists, who blame him for holding up peace talks.  Major's ruling Conservative Party has a slim majority in Parliament, and relies on the support of Protestant Northern Irish MPs to remain in power.<p>

Many now fear a return to the bitter conflict which has engulfed Northern Ireland for 25 years.  It began in the early 1970s, when a Catholic campaign for civil rights - they had been denied proper housing and voting rights by the Protestant majority - degenerated into violence in the face of Protestant and British intransigence, with the formation of the Irish Nationalist 'Provisional IRA'.  <p>

The IRA then began a campaign of bombings and shootings against military and police targets in Northern Ireland and England.  In response to what they saw as the Catholic threat, some Loyalists set up their own terrorist groups - the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters - which attacked Catholic targets.<p>

While many - but not all - Catholics want to see Northern Ireland re-united with the Republic of Ireland, most Protestants remain 'Unionists' - loyal to the United Kingdom.  The Northern Ireland province of Ulster was divided from the south in 1920 after the Anglo-Irish war, on the insistence of its majority Protestant population.<p>

The Northern Irish peace process has been stalled for several months.  While the IRA - through its political wing Sinn Fein - has offered to hold all-party talks with the Unionists and the two governments, the Unionists and the British Government refused to meet the IRA until it had begun to surrender or 'decommission' its weapons.<p>

In an effort to transcend this impasse, a three-man International Commission - including the former United States senator George Mitchell - was asked to produce a report.  Two weeks ago, they recommended that talks should begin anyway and that the issue of weapons should not hold them up.<p>

The British Prime Minister John Major, while giving a luke-warm response to the report, then proposed elections across Ulster - a suggestion likely to alarm Nationalists, who have never forgotten the discrimination imposed on them by the Protestant-dominated Stormont Parliament before it was suspened in 1972.<p>

Now Major is taking the blame for missing his chance to promote real peace in Northern Ireland.  His apparent rejection of the Mitchell report is interpreted by many Nationalists - and even some in his own party - as being due to his need for continued Unionist support in Parliament to prevent his own government's collapse.<p>

If the IRA has now given up its attempt to secure a peaceful re-integration of Ireland, then the head of its political wing Sinn Fein - Gerry Adams - also stands to lose his credibility.  Adams was central to securing the ceasefire in the first place, in September 1994.  If he becomes marginalised, it is likely that the hardliners within the IRA's command have triumphed. <p>

In this event, Northern Ireland - and mainland Britain - will be preparing for more long years of violence.<p>

This test is just a bit of fun and not 'scientific' at all. But marketing

<br><font size=-1> Dr David Bernadino, who ran a clinic in Huambo until 1992, when he was assassinated by Unita.<br><br>   As a skilled intellectual, he was the epitome of all that the Unita leader, Jonas Savimbi, hated.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Photographer unknown</font><br clear=left>
<p>
<hr><center><font size=+1>Throughout 20 years of war in Angola and a lost election, the rebel Unita leader Jonas Savimbi has bided his time.  He still aims to rule the country and, despite his war crimes, he still has clout.  Will he torpedo the UN's latest peace mission?  <p>

<b>Victoria Brittain </b>reports</font></center><hr><p>


<b>The Unita death squad waited for David Bernadino on the dusty red earth track outside the health post he founded more than 20 years before.</b><p>

No one could have been easier to find: he went there almost every day at the same time and left his car outside.  As he bled to death his assailants disappeared into the long grass and banana trees on the outskirts of Huambo.  <p>

It was December 1992.  Six weeks previously,  his closest friend, Fernando Marcelino, an internationally-known agricultural scientist, together with his wife and sister, were gunned down by Unita in their car at dusk in the centre of the town.<p>

The assassinations marked the end of hope in Angola.  In October that year, elections supervised by the United Nations were supposed to have put an end to the war in Angola that had been dragging on for three decades.<p>

Savimbi, the favoured son of the West and of the apartheid government in South Africa, had confidently expected to defeat the leftist MPLA government and win the presidency for himself.  He threatened, if he lost, to reduce Angola to another Somalia.<p>

He did lose - the MPLA government led by Eduardo Dos Santos hung on - and Savimbi set about fulfilling his threat.  The Huambo murders were a sign that no one, however highly regarded, was immune.<p>

Only the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia wiped out skills, human endeavour and potential on the scale Angola has endured since October 1992.  In effect, the UN peace initiative and the elections intensified the war.<p>

Now a similar scheme is under way, with all the same deluded optimism.  The UN, badly needing a success to offset its humiliation in Bosnia, is trying to secure a permanent ceasefire between the MPLA and Unita - enemies who began fighting each other even before independence in 1975.<p>

Savimbi himself is considering accepting the offer of a desperate government to make him vice-president.  There is little doubt that, at age 61, his ambition is still to be undisputed leader of Angola, whatever the cost.  His forces already have control of 40 per cent of the country.<p>

Savimbi was born in Munhango, the son of a station master, in August 1934, and was educated by Protestant missionaries.  Under the Portuguese colonialists, the country boy left Angola in 1958 to study medicine at Lisbon and later Lausanne.  He spent the mid-Sixties in exile, ambitious and looking for a cause.  <p>
<center><hr><b><font size=+1>Suave, never without his ivory-handled pistol, and multi-lingual after many years of close contact with every intelligence service in the West, Savimbi became the darling of the Reagan White House.</font></b><hr></center><p>
After a flirtation with the main Angolan liberation movement, Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), he began working for PIDE, the Portuguese secret service, and was recruited by the CIA. <p>

With their encouragement he founded his own Unita movement - through which the Americans hoped to gain control of Angola after independence.<p>

Suave, never without his ivory-handled pistol, and multi-lingual after many years of close contact with every intelligence service in the West, Savimbi became the darling of the Reagan White House.<p>

Known to his admirers as "the black de Gaulle", he was feted as the democratic hope for Angola, and indeed for Africa, by the generation of US right-wingers who funded the contras in Nicaragua and the Mujahedin in Afghanistan.<p>

He has always enjoyed the support of powerful conservative interests in Europe: Vote Savimbi posters went up in the streets of Lisbon during the run-up to the 1992 elections.<p>

Huambo province, covering the central area of Angola, was Savimbi's birth-place and he has spent more than 20 years building up a sense of separateness and grievance in this region among his largely rural ethnic group, the Ovimbundu.<p>

His closest associates are from his own clan.  This has been the ethnic power base of the military machine built by South Africa and the United States to crush the MPLA and the passionate nationalism they stood for in Africa.<p>

In the 1992 elections, the Ovimbundu vote went overwhelmingly to Unita - much of it by coercion, observed silently by the UN - and gave them just over a third of the seats in the National Assembly. <p>

This is almost the same as the Ovimbundu proportion of the country's population.  Savimbi has few followers in the rest of the nation.  Support for the MPLA, spread along the coast and round the edges of the Central Highlands, is multi-racial and multi-tribal.<p>

</font><br clear=left>

It has always been Savimbi's goal to make his headquarters at Huambo town.  He held the town for 100 days at independence in 1975, with his South African military backers.  The MPLA won it back, with the help of Cuban troops, and held on to it for another 17 years: a government-controlled outpost in the midst of Unita territory.<p>

For the Portuguese, Huambo had been the jewel of the Central Highlands, where they built their pink and blue villas with patterned tiles and verandahs under great, flowering purple jacaranda and flame trees.<p>

It was home, too, to a group of the MPLA's leading intellectuals, several of them descended from the Portuguese settlers.  They remained the incarnation of what the MPLA had been during the liberation war.  With boundless optimism - and the backing of a good many Cuban doctors and teachers who followed the Cuban troops - they set out to make one of the most backward countries in Africa an example of non-racial socialist transformation.<p>

Dr Bernadino ran the clinic he had built at the edge of the bush, while Fernando Marcelino became internationally known for his work at the Chianga agricultural research station, with its priceless plant and soil collections.<p>

As the MPLA drifted away from its principles under pressure of war, Dr Bernadino was one of the rare critics of the party from the inside, publishing a small political magazine, Jango.<p>

However, that made him no less of an enemy for Unita.  He and the rest of the Huambo group were the epitome of all Savimbi hated and, in 1992, when he won the control of the town again, they were easy targets.  Dr Bernadino and the Marcelino family were assassinated.<p>

"We believed then we could change the world with our energy and our principles," said a university lecturer who was a teacher in Huambo in the Seventies.  "Today we are absolutely without hope."
<p>
<center><hr><b><font size=+1>"We believed then we could change the world with our energy and our principles... Today we are absolutely without hope."</font></b><hr></center><p>

Huambo was a special place in a special country.  Through the Seventies and Eighties, Angola became a proxy battleground in the Cold War.  The US backed Savimbi, and the Soviet Union and other socialist bloc countries supplied the MPLA government with a formidable military force - not least because Angola was a key player in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.<p>

The Angolan government allowed the African National Congress guerrillas to set up training camps within their borders.  As a result, southern Angola became a target for successive South African Defence Force invasions.<p>

The US, Portugal, France, Zaire, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and others, have backed Savimbi openly or covertly for all these years; undercover South African troops fought alongside Savimbi.<p>

The Angolan government, meanwhile, depended, from independence to 1990, on a 40,000-strong Cuban troop force.  Angola's riches of oil, diamonds and gold have for decades acted as a magnet for every shady business outfit on the continent.  The stage was set for Africa's longest-running war.<p>

The latest ceasefire, brokered by the US and the UN, was agreed upon in Lusaka last November as the first step to yet another peace process.  But for anyone living there now, peace is a chimera.  Fire fights on the main roads are commonplace. <p>

And, since Unita controls most areas beyond a perimeter of about 10 miles around Huambo itself, the province is effectively partitioned.<p>

Last month a truck carrying a vaccination team was blown up by a mine after a day working in villages.  Six people were killed.  Yet complete freedom of movement throughout the country was agreed as part of the Lusaka Protocol, and 7000 UN troops were to police it at a cost to the international community of $800 million.  <p>

The first of them to arrive were a battalion of Uruguayans now encamped near Huambo airport.  Even they often cannot get permission from Unita to visit Bailundo, Savimbi's latest headquarters, or to travel into the interior.<p>

The other key part of their mission is to oversee the disarmament of Unita troops and their eventual demobilisation.  The UN soldiers are strictly forbidden to talk to journalists, but, as one said, that is certainly not because they could tell you what is going on, they don't know themselves.
<p>
The previous UN mission, to prepare the 1992 elections, was a fiasco because Unita continued to occupy one fifth of the country (it now has about twice that).  Unita did not disarm; and it abused the quartering areas by filling them with young boys and old men, while the core of the Unita army remained ready for renewed war.<p>

The government kept better faith with the agreement and did disband its army, which is why the MPLA were so badly wrong-footed when Unita launched their attack after the elections - the more so because they no longer had the Cuban troops to support them.  Savimbi himself fled to Huambo as soon as he knew he had lost the vote.<p>

The Huambo murders marked the beginning of a period of the worst destruction the country has seen.  Within two years at least half a million people died, three million or more were uprooted - more than in the previous two decades.<p>

Today the entire population is traumatised.  From late 1992, Unita unleashed a war which reduced government control to the coastal strip and half a dozen garrison towns which withstood sieges of nine months or more.<p>

The diamond mines of the northeast, seized by Unita, provided the means to buy arms on a massive scale.  In the process Angola, rich not only in oil, but in many cultures, lost its infrastructure and all the development of education, health, commerce and industry built up, despite the war, since independence.<p>

<center><hr><b><font size=+1>The Huambo murders marked the beginning of a period of the worst destruction the country has seen.  Within two years at least half a million people died, three million or more were uprooted... </font></b><hr></center><p>

Huambo itself suffered a 55-day siege of constant shelling by Unita before it fell with tens of thousands of deaths.<p>

One man described living through the siege in a hole underground with a stock of food and his entire family, including the dog, the cat and a bird.  Barely a building was left intact and every wall and every car is pock-marked with bullet holes.<p>

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children fled on foot, abandoning the dying, fording rivers, striking paths through the bush, to the safety of government areas three weeks' walk away on the coast.<p>

Those who stayed behind in Huambo under Unita say it became "a silent town".  Under a regime of secret police, spies and denunciations, people were afraid to talk or even laugh. <p>

Savimbi made it his capital for more than a year until the government retook it last November.  Stories of disappearances, bodies thrown into wells, and constant fear come up again and again.<p>

Huambo mirrored the dictatorship which Savimbi had established over nearly 20 years in Unita's previous headquarters at Jamba in the southeast corner of the country.<p>

Stories of corporal punishment, denunciations, women burned at the stake accused of witchcraft, repression of all kinds seeped out in the 1980s, but were mostly discounted in the press as government propaganda.  What happened in Huambo is well known, but the international community is forgetting as fast as possible.<p>

The Unita occupation was all the more traumatic because of the contrast with the years of peace before the elections of 1992, when Huambo bounced back to life as roads and rail links to the coast were opened again.  Normal economic life began and the factories were working at capacity for the first time for years.  "Everyone wanted to believe we had a new life and the UN was there to protect it."<p>

Today every factory stands idle, stripped of machinery and spare parts in a town where the population has resorted to theft to survive.  Government structures are hanging by a fragile thread.  Nurses and doctors, for example, are working in the hospital despite not having been paid for seven months.<p>

Ten years ago this hospital was filled with pitiably afflicted patients but survived on a spirit of defiant energy.  Dozens of Cuban, Russian and Angolan doctors operated around the clock, despite the lack of mains water and electricity.  <p>

Today it is a shadow of the past, with few patients making the effort to come there, and blank despair in the eyes of the remaining 11 Angolan doctors and 10 Vietnamese.  They live by whatever trading they can do on their day off.<p>

Retreating Unita troops systematically looted all the foreign aid agencies, including the Red Cross complex at Bomba Alta where all 56 foreign workers left in the town were gathered.<p>

It was a lesson to the international community of Unita's ruthlessness, turned for once on them.  "All of us lost every single thing.  They took all the cars, radios, computers and communications equipment," said one official.<p>

Savimbi set up a new headquarters at Bailundo, a small town 40 miles north of Huambo, simply turning people out of their houses and taking them over.<p>

<center><hr><b><font size=+1>Mr Boutros-Ghali embraced him warmly and, in the course of his speech, raised his arms with a "Viva Unita", according to a foreigner present. </font></b><hr></center><p>

The government, having regained Huambo and the road to the coast, held back from driving Unita out of the province entirely, under heavy pressure from the United States to save Savimbi from humiliation.<p>

History has been assiduously rewritten to ascribe the failure of the previous UN mission to lack of UN personnel and facilities.  But the real issues were first, Unita's lack of commitment to the agreement, and second, the cynical decision within the UN Security Council to keep Unita's violations of the agreement largely hidden from the world.<p>

Nine months after the Lusaka agreement exactly the same situation is being reproduced.  Only the Angolan army commander, 38-year-old General Joao Matos, has publicly drawn the parallel and warned of the consequences of another UN failure: a return to war.<p>

UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali visited Angola last month and described its peace process as an example to other nations at war.  <p>

"Peace of heart exists," said the Secretary-General who met President Dos Santos in Luanda before travelling to Bailundo to meet Savimbi.  The two men have known each other for 30 years, since Savimbi was a young man based in Cairo.  <p>

Mr Boutros-Ghali embraced him warmly and, in the course of his speech, raised his arms with a "Viva Unita", according to a foreigner present.  Even without that, the visit to Bailundo itself was widely seen as an insult to President Dos Santos and a signal of support for Savimbi.  It was a last-minute decision made by the Secretary-General after a high-level US team which visited Bailundo failed to persuade Savimbi to travel to Luanda to meet Dr Boutros Ghali. <p>

Savimbi has thus achieved implicit UN endorsement of Bailundo as an alternate seat of power to Luanda.
<p>
Savimbi himself met President Dos Santos on May 6 in Zambia and pledged himself publicly to peace, to accepting every clause in the Lusaka protocol, and to accepting Dos Santos as his president.<p>

On the South African model the President offered Savimbi one of two vice-presidencies, and the National Assembly has approved a change in the constitution if he accepts.  <p>

It was an offer President Dos Santos made to the Unita leader once before, in September 1992, just before the election when he proposed that whichever of them won should make the other vice-president.  Savimbi turned it down then, sure that he would win and with no wish to share power.<p>

The international support for Savimbi, which saw him backed by millions of US dollars and by thousands of South African Defence Force soldiers in an earlier phase, still allows him to bide his time - perhaps for a Republican presidency in Washington.<p>

Savimbi's reputation has weathered revelations of the killings of some of his closest lieutenants and their families, wholesale detention of tens of thousands of people, a long alliance with the apartheid regime, and the defection of his top cadres.<p>

Even the destruction of the past three years has not seen him labelled as a war criminal.  Every round of negotiations with the UN has given him another lease of respectability while further eroding the government's capacity to do anything for its people.  General Matos speaks for many when he says: "The UN is contributing to the degradation of Angola, not to peace."<p>

Even the country which was at the root of Angola's crisis has joined the international chorus.  President Nelson Mandela met Savimbi earlier this year and called for reconciliation, echoing his own treatment of Chief Buthelezi, Savimbi's old friend and ally during the days of apartheid.<p>

<b>But it hurt Angolans deeply.  Tens of thousands of Angolans paid with their lives in the regional war against apartheid.  They did not know, as the survivors do now, that the country would also pay with the death of their hopes, their pride, and their dignity, as the international community chose to reward the crimes of a man who remains the tool of the powerful outsiders who want control of Angola's riches and its destiny.</b><p>

<html><head><title>Unicef  - Children First: Issue 32, The £3 million 'change' for good</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#333366" vlink="#3399ff" text="#000000"><img src="../unicef_pix/unicef_logo.gif"><hr><h2 align=center>The &#163;3 million 'change' for good</h2>EVERY year millions of pounds in foreign coins and notes are lost down the backs of sofas, or sit tucked away in drawers when people return home from other countries. &quot;Change for Good&quot; is a UNICEF scheme designed to collect that lost currency and transform it into services for children. Passengers on a number of airlines have responded with enthusiasm, but nowhere with as much combined success as on British Airways flights. In just over two years BA passengers have donated a staggering £3 million, which has helped children all around the world.<p>British Airways' belief that customer service should not end as soon as a passenger disembarks, means that one of the company's goals is &quot;To be a good neighbour, concerned for the community and the environment&quot;. The Change for Good scheme has been a very successful way of helping to realise that goal. Money from the scheme has gone to support UNICEF programmes on every continent and in almost every area of UNICEF's work. And the scheme has shown how relatively small amounts of money can make a real difference. <table align=left width=170><tr><td><img width=147 height=105 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 src="pg19.jpg"></td><tr><td><small>HRH The Duchess of Kent meets BA staff at the Compass Centre crew base.&copy;Ken McKay</small></td></tr></table><br><br>UNICEF's Representative in Kenya, Chrispin Wilson, is delighted with the £75,000 of Change for Good funding his office recently received for a sanitation programme in the slums of Nairobi: &quot;This money is very important. It's going to bring relief to 100,000 people whose sanitation and drainage facilities are currently virtually non-existent. It will have a big impact&quot;.<p> Of course the success of the scheme depends on the genorosity of BA passengers. Although the idea is that passengers put the coins and notes they no longer need into the special Change for Good envelopes, in practice many people make a more substantial donation encouraged by an in-flight appeal video. One passenger gave a cheque for US$3,000 - hardly small change! In fact the small coins that were the initial target account for less than 10 per cent of the phenomenal total. <p>It is not only passengers who have been generous in their response. British Airways cabin crew and ground staff have worked tirelessly to promote Change for Good, which was originally suggested to British Airways management through the &quot;Brainwaves&quot; staff suggestion scheme. In June, the Patron of the UK Committee, HRH the Duchess of Kent, visited British Airways' flight and cabin crew headquarters to thank staff for all their hard work as the public face of Change for Good's success. An impressive new visual display has been set up at the Compass Centre crew base to keep track of the scheme's progress. Crew and ground staff based overseas will also be able to visit programmes and see the scheme in action for themselves.<p>British Airways also recommend a number of projects with which they have a special link. One of these, the &quot;Dhaka Project&quot; is an orphanage actually founded by BA crews, which understandably has a special place in the heart of staff members. During her visit to the Compass Centre, HRH The Duchess of Kent presented a cheque for £20,000 for the orphanage, raised by Change for Good. Captain Rob Jenkinson, a BA staff member who is one of the trustees of the project explains: &quot;The village we built at Sreepur has now been open for over seven years we have recently had a major maintenance survey carried out at the village and the UNICEF donation will enable us to carry out most of the urgent repair work needed.&quot; <p>Captain Jenkinson also sums up the incredible response to Change for Good when he says: &quot;It is an excellent Scheme appreciated by passengers and crews alike. Long may it continue.&quot;<p><center><table width=95% bgcolor=#ccffff border=1 ><tr><td><h3 align=center>Change adds up to a healthy future</h3><font size=4>EARLIER this year HRH the Duchess of Kent visited UNICEF work in India. During her visit she saw at first hand what Change for Good money is able to do. UNICEF Press Officer, Victoria Rae, accompanied the visit, and describes the exciting changes being made in a slum in Madras.</font><p>On a hot, dusty morning we arrived at the urban slum of Pulianthope in Madras to be met by the sights, sounds and smells of a city community going about the hustle and bustle of daily life. Women and their children came out to greet us, dressed in their best clothes and jewellery, often borrowed for the occasion. But this was no red-carpet visit. We were quickly in the thick of it, amongst the crowds, carts, animals and endless smiles - hit by the whole experience of the environment, its vibrancy and its poverty. <table align=right width=170><tr><td><img hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 width=170 height=115 src="pg18.jpg"></td><tr><td><small>Children from Pulianthope line up to greet the royal visitor.&copy;Victoria Rae</small></td></tr></table><br><br>Pulianthope is one of five slums in the Madras area with a total of about 40,000 families chosen for a pioneering, community-based water and sanitation programme. Across India, around a million children die every year from diarrhoeal diseases from drinking unclean water or living in an unhygienic household environment. In crowded inner city areas, disease can be rife and Pulianthope is one of the areas worst affected by diarrhoeal disease.  <p>To combat this, the Pulianthope programme takes a holistic approach aimed at improving the whole environment: providing safe water, education about how to prevent disease, and practical ways which will help improve families' daily lives and so help improve the whole neighbourhood. This innovative programme, along with similar work in Delhi and Calcutta has received £170,000 from Change for Good.<p><center><font size=4 color=blue><b>The success lies with the people themselves</b></font></center><p>As we were greeted by smiling, excited women and children, it became clear that the success lies not really with UNICEF, which provides the momentum and technical support for the project, or with our partners the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, but with the people themselves. They, and particularly the women, are the driving force behind the improvements - and they are slowly but surely reaping the benefits. <p>Imaginative means - puppet shows and handbills - are used to communicate the importance of hygiene to everyone, young and old. Mothers are trained in administering Oral Rehydration Solution to treat outbreaks of diarrhoea in their children, who in turn are taught the importance of washing their hands, and grandmothers learn about washing food in boiled water before cooking. <p>With Change for Good support, income generation schemes are now up and running where women can learn new skills, offering them a route out of the urban poverty which is so closely linked with the local health conditions. We visited a tailoring centre where young women were learning to make clothes, a trade which will bring not only money, but a feeling of empowerment as they are able to better provide for their families. Savings schemes administered by groups themselves mean that women can take out loans to buy not just latrines but also equipment for their new employment.<p><center><font size=4 color=blue><b>An exciting future for the children of Pulianthope</b></font></center><p>It all adds up to an exciting future - healthier, cleaner future for the children of Pulianthope. I'll certainly remember the laughter and the commitment of the many people we met on our visit and not forget the difference that donations collected through BA can make to their lives.<p></td></tr></table></center><p> <hr>©Copyright: UNICEF 1996<hr><center><SMALL><b> [<ahref="../index.html" target="_parent"> UNICEF Home Page</A>] [<ahref="http://www.childrenfirst.org">Support UNICEF</A>] [<ahref="../news.html">News</A>] [<ahref="../events.html">Events</A>] [<ahref="../publications.html">Publications</A>] [<ahref="../education.html">Education</A>]</font></SMALL></b></center></body></html>

In blue indelible pen he wrote his name, his events - 800 metres and 1500 metres - his country, Burundi, and topped it all off with his signature, as illegible as you'd expect a budding computer programmer's signature to be. He handed the T-shirt on to Steve Cram, whom we'd run into almost by accident at an indecently late hour in a bar in Atlanta. Cram, too, signed the T-shirt, adding the word &quot;retired&quot; underneath his autograph. <p>The half dozen past, present and future Olympians gathered in Atkins Park bar for a BBC Radio Five interview about Olympic Aid-Atlanta, laughed at Cram's footnote. Their laughter highlighted the camaraderie that characterises the Olympic Aid-Atlanta programme, the unique collaborative fund-raising venture between UNICEF and the International Olympic Committee, which aims to help children in fourteen countries at war. And it symbolised the way in which the Olympic Games can bring together athletes of every race, religion and creed, allowing them to converse on equal terms, using the international language of sport.<p>When Cram set his world record, Gilbert was a young boy growing up in Burundi. In 1993, when Cram was entering the twilight years of his illustrious career, Gilbert was a pupil at Kivimba High School. On October 21st of that year, a group of Hutu soldiers Ð Gilbert is Tutsi Ð rounded up Gilbert and 200 of his schoolmates, placed them in a room of the schoolhouse, doused them with petrol and set them alight. Gilbert was one of the few who, miraculously, survived: &quot;The soldiers were around the house, waiting for someone to try to escape so that they could kill him, but when they saw me, my back, legs and arms were on fire, and they said, Leave him; he'll die anyway.'&quot; Gilbert ran into the bush and put out the fire that was eating away at his flesh. <p><img align=right width=185 height=122 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 src="pg8.jpg"><center><i>&quot;Sometimes in hospital I had nightmares... now that's finished and I dream about sport&quot;</i></center><p><font size=2>Image: Outside a village health centre near the Afghan city of Balkh women and children gather for the immunisation campaign funded by Olympic Aid-Atlanta.<br>&copy;UNICEF/HQ96-0178/Hartley</font><p>After three hours of running, Gilbert came across some friendly soldiers, who took him to hospital, where he spent three months recovering from the burns that have left terrible scarring on his arms and back. &quot;Sometimes in hospital, I had nightmares, bad dreams of what happened to me. But now that's finished. I dream about sport. I dream about track and field, about improving. I dream about holding the national and world records in my distance.&quot;<p>His unseen scars have been aided in healing by psycho-social counselling, his visible scars by medical care, both in Burundi and the United States. It's for youngsters like Gilbert that Olympic Aid was created: to give them hope and a chance to succeed in spite of senseless wars that ravage their countries. Gilbert is one of the lucky ones, a young man who seems to have beaten the psychological physical handicaps that war can inflict on its innocent victims. <p>Without funding from programmes like Olympic Aid-Atlanta, young men such as Gilbert would have neither dreams nor the hope to fuel them. It seems almost obscene that the average corporate sponsorship sum at the 1996 Olympics was $42 million, while the goal of Olympic Aid-Atlanta 1996 was to raise just half that amount. With $21 million, UNICEF would be able to help vaccinate, counsel, educate and care for some 18 million children in 14 countries in war. <p>Olympic Aid-Atlanta hopes to harness the goodwill and solidarity engendered by the Olympic Games, and turn it into tangible help in the form of donations which will be used to step up programmes delivering essential medicines and health supplies, fund immunisation campaigns and provide education and trauma counselling to children whose lives have been disrupted by war. <p>Roger Black, one of Britain's silver medalists, and one of two dozen British Olympians who support Olympic Aid-Atlanta 1996, sums up the initiative saying: &quot;Children who grow up in war may have important contributions to make to the field of international athletics, but without the most basic necessities, many of these children will never have a chance. That is why I believe that Olympic Aid-Atlanta is so important: through it, we can give these children a start.&quot;<p><h4>Olympic Aid-Atlanta in Action</h4><img width=125 height=83 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 src="pg9.jpg"><br>MID-JUNE, and British Olympic gold medalist David Wilkie is on his way to Afghanistan. He's off to witness the first phase of a mass immunisation campaign which is the launch of the Olympic Aid-Atlanta programmes. This early delivery of aid to recipient countries was made possible through a $5 million donation in April by the European Community Humanitarian Office.<p><font size=2>Image: David Wilkie greets a baby and girl at the ICRC's orthopaedic workshop in Kabul on his visit to see Olympic Aid-Atlanta programmes in Afghanistan.</font><p>Before the immunisation campaign started, negotiations had to be undertaken to try to ensure a &quot;period of tranquillity&quot; during the vaccination campaign - and the truce held, for the most part, for the necessary five days, allowing over 32 million children under the age of five, and 1.1 million women to travel in security to be vaccinated. <p>Wilkie and Ann Cody, a gold medalist in the paralympics, saw at first hand the effects - both direct and indirect - that war can have on the lives of children. They met Sabura, who lost the use of her left leg after contracting polio five years earlier. Had the long-running war not prevented her from attending an immunisation campaign a few years earlier, she would still have full use of both legs.Her brother, Alimuddin, lost his right leg when a mine which had been planted in the bathroom of his home exploded. Sabura and Alimuddin are just two of hundreds of children, women and men who are treated every at the ICRC Orthopaedic Workshop in Kabul. Although many are victims of bombs and mines, the majority of the patients suffer from the effects of polio, a disease that can be simply prevented by two doses of an oral vaccine. Simply prevented - if only the potential victims, who are primarily children, had safe access to immunization programmes.<p>The second round of the vaccination programme coincided with the Olympic Games, from July 19th to August 4th. It had been hoped that another truce could be negotiated, subliminally mirroring the Olympic truce that characterised the Games of antiquity, when the warring sides laid down their arms and travelled to the valley of Olympia to take part in the Games in the spirit of peace, tolerance and cooperation. It was hoped that the same could be achieved in modern-day Afghanistan.<p>But the UNICEF-brokered period of tranquillity ended on July 24th, when a rocket attack on Kabul showered the UNICEF offices with shrapnel, injuring two workers. Despite the setback, phase two of the immunisation programme appeared to be going well: some 15,000 health workers were making their way to designated vaccination spots by any means possible, and an appeal was launched immediately to urge the warring factions to reinstate the period of tranquillity.<p>For David Wilkie the Olympics are a unique opportunity to encourage the fighters to lay down their weapons for children: &quot;The great thing about the Olympic Games,&quot; he says, &quot;is that the world pays attention for two weeks, and it's a great vehicle to use to say to countries at war, Let's have peace for two weeks and see what it's like. And if it's good, let's continue it for a long, long time.'&quot; <p>Winning gold at the Olympics marked the greatest moment in his sporting life, he said. Now, twenty years later, he continues to use the high public profile of an Olympic gold medalist to call attention to the plight of others less fortunate than himself.<p><i>Donations to Olympic Aid-Atlanta can be made until the end of 1996. Funds raised will be used to accelerate aid programmes to children in 14 war-torn countries.

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Quebec Separatists Narrowly Defeated</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<center><h2>Quebec separatists narrowly defeated in referendum</h2></center>
<p>

Canada faced off the biggest threat to its unity in its 128-year existence yesterday, when the province of Quebec voted narrowly to remain within the country.<p>

Separatists in the French-speaking province had been running a vigorous campaign against the federalists, urging voters to give Quebec a new start.<p>

But they were defeated by a majority of 50.6 to 49.4, much narrower than the 60:40 margin during the 1980 referendum on separation.<p>

In a struggle that has raised emotions and tensions on each side, separatists vowed to continue their fight for an independent Quebec.  "We want a country and we will have it," promised Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau in Montreal.<p>

The shadow of racial tension was also raised, as French-speaking nationalists blamed <b><a href="../gemini/wk43_gemini_quebec.html">immigrants</a></b> for the vote against them - which is thought to have hinged on a mere 53,000 'yes' votes.  Parizeau scornfully claimed that his campaign had been beaten by "money and the ethnic vote".<p>

Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called on Canadians of all backgrounds to work together in a united country.  "The time has come for reconciliation," he said in a televised address to the nation.<p>

But the bitter divisions did lead to some violence.  Four people were injured and 50 arrested after police clashed with disappointed separatists on Monday night.<p>

In Montreal the office of the leader of Quebec's 'No' campaign was set on fire and badly damaged.  Other demonstrators threw stones and bottles at police and burned the Canadian flag.<p>

EGYPT: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CALLS FOR PROMPT THOROUGH AND 

IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALL CASES OF TORTURE AND 

DEATHS IN CUSTODY</title>

<h3>EGYPT: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CALLS FOR PROMPT THOROUGH AND 

IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALL CASES OF TORTURE AND 

DEATHS IN CUSTODY</h3>
Deaths in custody are on the increase in Egyptian police 

stations and prisons. At least 26 people have died in 

detention so far this year, Amnesty International said. 

<p>

In releasing a new report, the organization singled 

out al-Wadi al-Gadid Prison as having the highest numbers 

of death in custody. More than 2000 political detainees have 

been transferred to this prison since it opened early this 

year in the desert, west of Asyut.

<p>

The brutalizing climate at al-Wadi al-Gadid Prison is 

such that, according to reports, on their arrival, detainees 

are given "Hafl al-Istiqbal" (welcome party). This means 

that they find two rows of security officers waiting for 

them and have to crawl on their hands and feet, while the 

officers keep beating them with sticks until they arrive in 

their cells.

<p>

"Torture and ill-treatment, together with poor 

hygiene, overcrowded cells, poor diet and absence of basic 

medical facilities caused or contributed to most of these 

deaths," Amnesty International said in a report issued 

today.

<p>

The human rights organization, concerned by the 

increasing number of deaths in custody, claims that the 

systematic use of torture and ill-treatment which takes 

place immediately after arrest in the Headquarters of the 

State Security Investigations Department in Lazoghly Square 

and in police stations, now takes place even in prisons. 

This has been facilitated by keeping detainees in prolonged 

incommunicado detention.

<p>

Most of those who died were suspected members or 

sympathizers of banned Islamist groups such as al-Gama'a al- 

Islamiya and al-Gihad. Some of them had been held without 

charge or trial for several years, while others, tried and 

acquitted by state security or military courts, were kept in 

illegally prolonged detention, sometimes for as long as 22 

months.

<p>

In most cases, families of the dead have reportedly 

not been given copies of any medical and autopsy reports or 

even death certificates. Some were not even told of the 

cause of the death.

<p>

The Egyptian authorities continue to claim that all 

allegations of torture and deaths in custody are officially 

investigated. However, Amnesty International is deeply 

concerned that the methods of such investigations and their 

full findings are not made public, contrary to the 

requirements of international standards. Sixteen months have 

now elapsed since the death, reportedly following torture, 

of the lawyer 'Abd al-Harith Mohammad Madani and the 

findings of the official investigation into the 

circumstances surrounding his death have yet to be made 

public.

<p>

"All detainees should be treated humanely and have 

access to their families, lawyers and medical doctors at all 

times. The conditions of detention should meet 

internationally agreed minimum standards," the human rights 

organization said.

<p>

Amnesty International urges the Egyptian Government to 

live up to its international obligations and act decisively 

to end human rights violations.<p><hr><p>

<font size=4>

The renewed IRA bombing attack should have come as no surprise, argues one of Ireland's leading columnists. The media was in a position to know, but failed in its obligation to warn the public.</font><p>

<hr width=71%><p>


Why did the breakdown of the Provisional IRA's ceasefire take everybody by surprise? Since the first bomb exploded in Canary Wharf in February one question has been put over and over again to journalists: why was there no warning in the media that the situation had deteriorated to this extent?<p>


To be fair, it does seem that even Sinn Fein leaders like Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not know that the bomb was going to go off when it did. But equally, looking back now, it is clear that they did expect that, sooner or later, the IRA would lose patience with the slow pace of the Peace Process and that when this happened, its most likely target would be one of several prestige buildings in the City of London.<p>


It's always been an article of faith that these 'spectaculars' in Britain have much more impact on politicians at Westminster than any number of deaths in Northern Ireland. 'When I saw John Major speaking in the House of Commons and "binning" the Mitchell Report (containing the recommendations of an international body set up under former US Senator George Mitchell to resolve the long standing problem of decommissioning IRA weapons) I knew it was only a matter of time before the IRA did something', one Sinn Fein member who had been an active supporter of the Peace Process told me.<p>



It is ironic, all the same, that the original IRA ceasefire, announced at a time when Sinn Fein was still banned from the airwaves in Britain, was fully flagged in advance in the media. The return to violence took place when there was no official censorship of this kind, and Gerry Adams had a degree of access to the airwaves which was a cause of envy to many politicians.<p>



So how did we get it so wrong? Journalists - and I'm as much to blame as anyone -   should have realised and reported that the situation was deteriorating fast, that a breakdown of the ceasefire could happen at any time. Whenever one talked to Gerry Adams, and those close to him in Sinn Fein, they warned of the growing impatience among Republican activists, that the pursuit of politics as an alternative to 'the armed struggle' was not yielding the tangible results they had expected - and which, they believed, they had been promised.<p>



Within the IRA, where mistrust of the British government's motives and strategy in regard to Northern Ireland is deeply engrained, the suspicion was growing that they 'had been taken for a ride'. Those opposed to the 'alternative unarmed strategy' (ie politics) from the start had always argued that the British would raise obstacles to delay progress towards meaningful talks, and would then use that time to demoralise and break the IRA.

These tensions were reported but, for a whole variety of reasons, the real threat was not taken seriously. When Gerry Adams warned that the whole Peace Process could unravel he was accused by politicians of making threats or crying wolf. This disapproval was echoed by interviewers on television and in the editorial columns of most newspapers. By the time the ceasefire broke down he seemed to find it difficult to ward off these criticisms. I remember asking him what he meant when he said the the process could go 'into reverse' and his answer was to point his right hand upwards and, slowly, make a gesture as though pulling a trigger.<p>



There were other warning signs which were reported but not, perhaps, properly analysed or understood. The increase in punishment shootings and beatings of alleged drug dealers were written about in terms of their savagery. The British and Irish governments insisted that, because they were not directed against members of the security forces, they did not constitute a breach of the ceasefire and journalists went along with this explanation. But what these attacks were about politically was that the IRA was determined to assert control of the ghetto areas from which it had traditionally drawn support. After the cease fire was announced in 1994, many of these activists had become involved in political activity, organising marches and so on. They had been prepared, at the minimum, to give politics a chance. But even that level of support, according to Sinn Fein, had been dropping away for some time before the Canary Wharf bomb. Politics, it seemed, was no longer credible.<p>



There are many forms of censorship and, from personal experience, I know that self censorship by journalists of what they write and report is the most corrosive, at least in a democracy where theoretically there are few restrictions on the freedom of the press. One saw this over and over again in Northern Ireland. Most journalists who reported on the conflict came to understand that they were working within serious, if unspoken, constraints - political disapproval, fear of offending public opinion, the denial of access to certain sources. To deny these realities, to insist on making waves meant running the risk of being branded as 'unreliable', a 'Provo-lover', labels which were not likely to help the individual's career prospects.<p>



What this meant was that the public was not given the information to enable it to understand what was happening in Northern Ireland. Instead it was told that the IRA was a bunch of psychopaths, that it had no support in the Catholic community, that by drawing peace loving people on both sides together the terrorists could be marginalised and defeated. To take an example: it was only after the leaking of an official British Army report which argued that the IRA could not be defeated by military methods, that it became acceptable for journalists to voice the same views.<p>



In the case of the ceasefire, different political influences were at work. Different but perhaps even more persuasive. After 18 months of peace we had come to believe that it could not break down. Those of us who had covered the tragedy of the Northern Ireland conflict for more than 20 years, stood in bleak graveyards, and watched the bewildered faces of widows and children, desperately wanted the peace to be secured. We seized on reasons for optimism, the enormous outpouring of emotion that greeted President Clinton's visit to Northern Ireland, for example. We either did not see, or did not want to see, the danger signals that all was not well.<p>



Worse still, there was considerable disapproval of those journalists who did go against the grain, insisted on reporting that tensions were growing within the Republican movement and that the peace could break down. There was a sense that they were somehow not fully committed to peace just as, in the past, there was an unspoken feeling that anyone who was critical of the police or the security forces was 'soft on terrorists.'<p>

<I>Italian business promoters and company representatives go from

the Italian sales representatives draw up a contract and a small

project (often in Italian) and either party promises to use his

influences and lobby the necessary bodies for the project's goahead.

<I>The European Community Delegations, which represent the Community

in other countries, are equally constrained by limited staffing.

Often expertise in specific areas is lacking. Delegation staff

are often expected to control programs  twice or even ten times

larger than other donors, who are working with the same number

of people or more.</I>

<P>

Mirjam van Reisen, author of the chapter on the European Community's

development  cooperation programme

<P>

<I>The process constructed to manage and implement the Community

program is the result of the perceived needs of the Member States

to oversee their own interests. However, apart from the costs

involved, it is obvious that, given the relatively limited number

of staff, the strain on the Commission who has to manage these

Committees, is enormous, and, consequentially,  constrains the

quality of the implementation of the European Community Program.</I>

de la Coop&eacute;ration)</h4>

<HR>

<BR>

<P>

A la demande du pr&eacute;sident de la R&eacute;publique fran&ccedil;aise,

le prochain sommet des sept pays les plus industrialis&eacute;s

(G7) abordera la question de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement,

&agrave; l'issue de ses travaux. A la veille de cette rencontre,

comment notre pays se situe-t-il par rapport &agrave; ses partenaires

occidentaux ? Comment s'articule notre dispositif de coop&eacute;ration

?

<P>

<H3>Une aide en augmentation</H3>

<P>

En 1994, la France a consacr&eacute; 47 milliards de francs &agrave;

l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement, soit 0,64% de son produit

int&eacute;rieur brut, se situant ainsi -pour ce qui est du rapport

APD/PIB- en t&ecirc;te des sept pays du G7, et au cinqui&egrave;me

rang des Etats membres du Comit&eacute; d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement

(CAD) de l'OCDE. En augmentation depuis cinq ans, cette aide se

rapproche de l'objectif fix&eacute; il y a plus de dix ans par

les Nations unies, qui &eacute;tait de consacrer au moins 0,7%

du PIB &agrave; l'APD.

<P>

Parmi les principaux pays industrialis&eacute;s, le Japon, la

France et le Royaume-Uni sont les seuls &agrave; avoir accru leur

APD en 1994, les Etats-Unis, le Canada, l'Allemagne et l'Italie

l'ayant sensiblement r&eacute;duite. Les ressources sont r&eacute;parties

ainsi : 78% des versements de l'APD fran&ccedil;aise sont all&eacute;s

&agrave; la coop&eacute;ration  bilat&eacute;rale, l'Afrique sub-saharienne

restant la premi&egrave;re b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire (plus de

47% de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale), loin devant l'Am&eacute;rique,

l'Asie et l'Afrique du Nord. Le reste des versements transite

par des organismes internationaux, essentiellement le Fonds europ&eacute;en

de d&eacute;veloppement (pr&egrave;s de la moiti&eacute; de l'aide

multilat&eacute;rale) et la Banque mondiale.

<P>

<H3>D'o&ugrave; viennent les fonds ?</H3>

<P>

Le minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration g&egrave;re environ

12% de l'APD (ce ratio est en baisse depuis plusieurs ann&eacute;es).

Pr&egrave;s de 49% de l'aide publique transite par le minist&egrave;re

de l'Economie et des Finances, qui intervient sous forme de contribution

aux institutions multilat&eacute;rales, de pr&ecirc;ts et dons

du Tr&eacute;sor, de consolidation ou d'annulation de dettes,

de soutien aux ajustements structurels. 

<P>

La Caisse fran&ccedil;aise de d&eacute;veloppement (CFD), institution

financi&egrave;re sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e, est plac&eacute;e

sous la double tutelle du minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration

et du minist&egrave;re de l'Economie et des Finances. Elle intervient

&eacute;galement dans le dispositif d'aide en accordant notamment

des subventions et des pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; long terme pour des

projets d'investissement productif.

<P>

Les autres apports publics fran&ccedil;ais proviennent de minist&egrave;res

conduisant des programmes de coop&eacute;ration technique (Affaires

&eacute;trang&egrave;res, DOM-TOM, Sant&eacute;, Education nationale,

Agriculture, Recherche...).

<P>

<H3>Un mot-cl&eacute; : la coordination</H3>

<P>

La r&eacute;forme de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement intervenue

au premier trimestre 1996 avait pour objectif de rendre l'aide

plus transparente, de la simplifier et de mieux coordonner l'action

des diff&eacute;rentes instances gouvernementales. Le renforcement

de la coordination interminist&eacute;rielle en mati&egrave;re

d'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement, sur les aspects bi et

multilat&eacute;raux, passera par la r&eacute;union r&eacute;guli&egrave;re

d'un Comit&eacute; interminist&eacute;riel de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement

(CIAD). La direction en sera assur&eacute;e par le Premier ministre

et le secr&eacute;tariat g&eacute;n&eacute;ral par le ministre

des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res et le ministre d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;

&agrave; la Coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

Cette r&eacute;forme du syst&egrave;me fran&ccedil;ais de coop&eacute;ration

s'inscrit elle-m&ecirc;me dans un effort de coordination et de

compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; des politiques d'aide au niveau

europ&eacute;en et au sein des instances internationales.

<H3>Abstract:<P>

</H3>

This article contributes to the debate on the re-evaluation of Dutch foreign policy on the basis of five items considered essential for this debate: 1. the concepts used in the debate should be more clarified; 2. the limited impact of political science; 3. the expansion of the concept of "security"; 4. the often misleading use of the "national interest" concept; and 5. bureaucratic/organizational contradictions and lack of coherence.

<B>In 1991 (drie jaar na het wonderjaar 1989) onderbraken wij met

de werkgroep `Buitenlands Beleid van Nederland' (B4) ons normale

onderzoekprogramma en publiceerden wij een bundel essayachtige

stukken over de rol van Nederland in de sinds 1989 zo veranderende

wereld. Wij bepleitten toen het houden van een `grand debate'

over de vraag welke gevolgen de veranderingen in de wereld zouden

moeten hebben voor het Nederlands beleid.<a href="#1">(1)</a> Weliswaar niet op onze

wenken, want pas vier jaar later worden we nu bediend, althans

zouden we bediend kunnen worden, wanneer het debat over de `herijking'

zich niet beperkt tot de vraag wie hoeveel waaraan moet betalen.</B>

<P>

<a name=inleiding></a><B>Inleiding</B>

<P>

Over zowel de noodzaak als de wenselijkheid van een groot debat

is al het nodige gezegd. De wereld van nu is immers in tal van

opzichten een andere dan die waar we tot voor kort mee vertrouwd

en aan gehecht waren. Dat de wereld er na 1989 eerder meer dan

minder ingewikkeld uitziet, is even duidelijk. Ook over de onduidelijke

term `herijking' en de al even ongelukkige suggestie dat men de

wereld even zou kunnen stilzetten, terwijl Nederland nadenkt en

pas op de plaats maakt, is al het nodige gezegd.

<P>

De term suggereert misschien ook te veel dat `beleid' een soort

meesterplan is van samenhangende doeleinden, instrumenten en strategie&euml;n.

Zo is het niet, of maar zeer ten dele. Wat voor `beleid' doorgaat,

is in de praktijk vaak helemaal geen grootse conceptie vooraf,

maar eerder de resultante van vele tientallen kleine beslissingen

en van doormodderen, waar men achteraf enige lijn in ontdekt.

Het woord `herijking' suggereert ook een vorm van eenmalige evaluatie

die de zaken voor langere tijd vastlegt. Zo is het echter niet,

al zullen bijvoorbeeld eventuele wijzigingen in de departementale

en bureaucratische structuur niet weer van de ene dag op de andere

ongedaan kunnen worden gemaakt.<a href="#2">(2)</a> Ook zijn de beperkingen, internationaal

en nationaal, waaronder beleidsvorming plaatsheeft zodanig, dat

radicale beleidswendingen zelden mogelijk zijn. Evaluatie is echter

niet iets dat eenmalig moet gebeuren, maar continu plaatsvindt,

of zou moeten vinden, in de vorm van kritische reflectie over

doelstellingen en prioriteiten enerzijds, en over werkwijze en

behaalde of uitgebleven resultaten anderzijds.

<P>

Dat wil natuurlijk niet zeggen dat het geen zin heeft van tijd

tot tijd een stapje achteruit te doen en van enige afstand naar

eigen doen en laten te kijken. Uit de nood van partijpolitieke

onenigheid over budgettaire prioriteiten zou nog best een deugd

kunnen worden gemaakt in de vorm van een systematisch debat over

doelstellingen, middelen en organisatie van het buitenlands beleid,

en dan bij voorkeur in de meest brede zin. Zover is het nog niet

en of het ooit zover zal komen, mag worden betwijfeld.

<P>

Het grote debat is in ieder geval nog niet echt op gang gekomen.

Dat ligt goeddeels aan het kabinet en in het bijzonder aan de

nauwst betrokkenen, die ons, afgezien van de aangekondigde intenties,

nog geheel in het duister laten tasten over de vraag of het alleen

maar om het geld zal gaan (de verdeling van de &#166;400 miljoen

die voor nieuw beleid beschikbaar is of ook een herverdeling van

bestaande middelen), dan wel of ook de substantie van het beleid,

de doelstellingen en prioriteiten enerzijds en de instrumenten

en organisatie anderzijds, aandacht zal krijgen. Er is geen regeringsstandpunt

waar men op kan steunen of schieten. Wat we zien is een minister

Van Mierlo die honderd bloemen laat bloeien, terwijl zijn beide

collega's Pronk en Voorhoeve elkaar de hand boven het hoofd houden

en andere bewindslieden hun claims indienen. Het echte debat wordt

niet afgesloten met een positiebepaling van de regering, maar

zal dan pas beginnen.

<P>

Wat we tot dusverre wel hebben, zijn &#190; min of meer overwogen

-bijdragen en losse flodders van partijen en organisaties en van

individuele politici. De ontwikkelingslobby is bezig te mobiliseren,

de werkgeversorganisatie VNO liet van zich horen en de vredesbeweging

zint ook op nieuwe kansen het beleid in de door haar gewenste

richting te sturen. Voor zover er een debat is, heeft het nog

weinig samenhang, richting en structuur. Dat is jammer, want de

zaken die op het spel staan zijn er belangrijk genoeg voor.

<P>

Ik wil mij in deze bijdrage aan het debat concentreren op vijf

punten die bij de herijking aan de orde zijn of zouden moeten

komen. Zij vertonen natuurlijk wel verwantschap, maar staan toch

min of meer op zichzelf. Ik sluit af met enige suggesties in welke

richting het beleid gewijzigd en verbeterd zou kunnen worden.

<P>

<a name=begrippenapparaat></a><B>Het begrippenapparaat</B> 

<P>

Zonder duidelijke begrippen heeft geen enkel debat kans op succes,

wanneer dat debat tenminste niet is gericht op punten scoren,

maar op het verkrijgen van beter inzicht. Daarin onderscheidt

zich de wetenschap van de politiek.

<P>

`Herijking' en het ook wel gebruikte `ontschotting' zijn beide

onduidelijke begrippen. Misbruik of oneigenlijk gebruik van de

termen ligt daarom op de loer. Aangezien ze nu toch gebruikt worden,

een enkele opmerking. Onder `herijking' versta ik een stelselmatige

beoordeling van het beleid. Dat kan en zal, als het goed en grondig

gaat, in verschillende termen en langs verschillende dimensies

plaatsvinden. Allereerst gaat het om de doelstellingen, richting

en intensiteit (prioriteiten) van beleid. Wat wil men bereiken?

Wat heeft de voorrang? En wat moet wijken als niet alles tegelijk

of ineens kan?

<P>

Vervolgens komt de vraag naar de daartoe nodige en beschikbare

middelen en instrumenten (financieel/militair/hulp en handel/diplomatie),

alsmede de organisatie van beleidsvoorbereiding, -vorming en -uitvoering.

Samen vormen ze de <U>input</U>-kant van het beleid. Ze kunnen

afzonderlijk, maar ook in hun onderlinge samenhang worden geanalyseerd.

<P>

Aan de andere kant staan de resultaten (de <U>output</U>-kant).

Wat heeft al die <U>input</U> aan geld, tijd en energie opgeleverd?

Kan het beter, effectiever, effici&euml;nter? Het gaat daarbij

niet alleen om de gewilde effecten; ook moet men rekening houden

met niet-beoogde en niet-verwachte, positieve en negatieve, effecten.

Resultaten kunnen worden gemeten naar hun effectiviteit (doelbereiking),

bijvoorbeeld de invloed van Nederland op een bepaald besluit,

en naar hun <U>efficiency</U> (het rendement van ingezette middelen).

Effectiviteit en <U>efficiency</U> zijn niet hetzelfde. Ideaal

is wellicht dat beide hoog zijn, maar ook zijn nog aanvaardbare

combinaties hoog-laag denkbaar, terwijl beide natuurlijk ook laag

kunnen zijn (volgens het door F. Bolkestein en anderen geschetste

beeld van het resultaat van ontwikkelingshulp).

<P>

Goed beleid betekent de optimale inzet van schaarse middelen.

Idealiter zou het marginale rendement van iedere ingezette gulden/ambtenaar

op het brede terrein van de buitenlandse politiek gelijk en, voor

zover nog niet gerealiseerd, de maatstaf bij reallocatie van middelen

moeten zijn. Maar dat rendement (bijvoorbeeld, in onderlinge vergelijking,

van militaire uitgaven, ontwikkelingshulp of assistentie aan de

herstructurering in Midden- en Oost-Europa) is vaak slechts bij

benadering, en meestal in het geheel niet, te meten. Daartoe ontbreekt

het instrumentarium ten enen male en zijn de doelstellingen meestal

te vaag.<a href="#3">(3)</a> Bovendien zijn de doelstellingen vaak zeer uiteenlopend

en onderling onvergelijkbaar en zijn daardoor de criteria voor

succes of falen te verschillend. Hulp kan bijvoorbeeld worden

gegeven aan land A, en niet aan land B, omdat het verwachte rendement

daar het hoogst of de behoefte het grootst is, dan wel om redenen

van direct economisch belang of van veiligheidspolitieke aard.

De aard van het doel en het perspectief van waaruit daarnaar gekeken

wordt, zullen het oordeel over de effectiviteit kleuren of zelfs

geheel bepalen.

<P>

Zonder de dobbelsteen als belangrijkste hulpmiddel bij de beleidsvorming

te hanteren, moet worden erkend dat we natuurlijk wel politieke

voorkeuren kunnen uitspreken en verschuivingen in prioriteiten

kunnen bepleiten, maar dat de bepaling van effectiviteit goeddeels

natte-vingerwerk blijft. Wie iets anders beweert, maakt zich schuldig

aan misleiding. Toch lijkt het voor de hand te liggen het debat

meer dan tot dusver het geval is te richten op het te verwachten

rendement van onze inspanningen en minder op het formuleren van

nieuwe, mooie doelstellingen.

<P>

In het debat wordt gesproken over `herijking' en over `ontschotting'.

Voor zover die begrippen iets betekenen, is dat niet hetzelfde.

Het eerste is algemeen, het tweede kan een specifiek gevolg zijn

van het eerste, niet andersom. Ontschotting zie ik als het in

hun onderling verband analyseren van deelproblemen enerzijds en

het wegnemen van daarbij horende organisatorische en bureaucratische

scheidslijnen anderzijds. Het verwachte resultaat daarvan is gemeenlijk

de vergroting van de samenhang en daarmee van de effectiviteit

van het beleid. Bij sommigen bestaat vooral de, al dan niet heimelijke,

verwachting dat ontschotting ook tot andere beleidsprioriteiten

zal leiden. Ontschotting kan dus leiden tot meer inhoudelijke

en tot grotere organisatorische samenhang.

<P>

Bij pleidooien voor ontschotting wordt vaak gesproken over `integratie'

en `co&ouml;rdinatie' van beleid. Het beleid zou te versnipperd

zijn om effectief te zijn. Departementen zouden tegen elkaar in

werken, terwijl dat best te vermijden zou zijn. Het zijn echter

vaak niet meer dan toverwoorden, die weinig inhoudelijks betekenen.

Als men niets anders weet te verzinnen, is dat altijd nog goed.

Het lijkt vervelend dat de linkerhand niet weet wat de rechter

doet, maar er is evenwel weinig aan de hand, zolang ze niet precies

hetzelfde doen of elkaar niet manifest in de weg zitten.

<P>

Ernstiger is de situatie waarbij ze elkaar wel tegenwerken. In

het eerste geval is het probleem nogal triviaal. Het gaat er dan

om door eliminatie van dubbelwerk tot <U>efficiency-</U>verbetering

te komen. Die kan het gevolg zijn van ontschotting. Dat kan overigens

ook het gevolg zijn van andere maatregelen die niet of slechts

oneigenlijk als ontschotting kunnen worden aangemerkt, bijvoorbeeld

veranderingen in de relaties tussen de krijgsmachtdelen en eliminatie

van dubbel werk (departementale structuur, opleidingen, transportcapaciteit).

Daartoe is echter geen inhoudelijke herijkingsoperatie, maar slechts

het aandraaien van de budgettaire duimschroef nodig.

<P>

Het tweede geval, waarbij delen van de overheid tegenstrijdige

belangen nastreven, is problematischer.

<P>

<a name=beperkte></a><B>Beperkte rol van de wetenschap</B> 

<P>

Vanwege alle onzekerheden en vanwege het feit dat persoonlijke

taxaties en waardeoordelen een zeer grote rol spelen, kan de wetenschap

slechts van beperkt nut zijn in het herijkingsdebat. Politieke

oordelen zullen doorslaggevend zijn, en dat kan niet anders. Over

de vraag wat hoofddoelstellingen en prioriteiten in beleid behoren

te zijn (wat mede inhoudt hoeveel geld waarvoor wordt uitgetrokken),

is en blijft steeds legitiem verschil van mening mogelijk. Dat

zijn en blijven in essentie politieke vragen, waarvoor dan ook

niet het waarheidsgehalte van de wetenschap geclaimd kan worden.

Wel kan deze op twee manieren hulp bieden: <U>a</U> door een bijdrage

te leveren aan (meer) analytische duidelijkheid en aan de zuivering

van het gehanteerde begrippenapparaat; en <U>b</U> doordat zij

op grond van meer dan willekeurig gekozen voorbeelden uitspraken

kan doen over bijvoorbeeld het te verwachten rendement van bepaalde

inspanningen. Systematische beleidsevaluatie is tot op zekere

hoogte mogelijk (zoals dat bijvoorbeeld ook gebeurt door de Inspectie

Ontwikkelingssamenwerking). Problematisch blijft echter de onzekerheid

over de vraag of bepaalde uitkomsten aan Nederlandse inspanningen

kunnen worden toegeschreven, terwijl de onkwantificeerbaarheid

van bepaalde uitkomsten het opmaken van een balans steeds zal

bemoeilijken. Men denke bijvoorbeeld aan de recente discussie

over de kosten en baten van ons lidmaatschap van de Europese Unie.<a href="#4">(4)</a>

<P>

Ik richt mij hieronder vooral op het eerste type bijdrage aan

het debat en wel in het bijzonder op twee benaderingen van het

probleem van de herijking/ontschotting, die zeker <U>niet</U>

zinvol zijn en zelfs averechts kunnen uitwerken: <U>1</U> het

zoeken van een oplossing in een voortdurende uitdijing van begrippen;en

<U>2</U> het forceren van keuzen met een beroep op `het nationaal

belang'.

<P>

<a name=uitdijend></a><B>Het uitdijend heelal van het veiligheidsbegrip</B> 

<P>

Het is karakteristiek voor het debat over de internationale politiek

dat op gezette tijden grote ontvankelijkheid bestaat voor pleidooien

om begrippen een veel ruimere inhoud te geven dan voorheen gebruikelijk

was. Zo kwam in de polemologie rond 1970 een discussie op gang

waarin naast <U>vrede</U> als afwezigheid van direct, fysiek geweld

een veel ruimer begrip vrede werd onderscheiden, dat als `positieve

vrede' duidde op de afwezigheid van wat als `structureel geweld'

werd omschreven. Vrede werd een container waarmee al het goede

kon worden omvat. Iets dergelijks zien we een aantal jaren later

gebeuren met het begrip <U>mensenrechten</U>, dat dan beter in

de markt ligt dan het in diskrediet gebrachte begrip vrede. Zo

leerden we naast de politieke en sociaal-economische mensenrechten

een derde en wellicht volgende generatie van `mensenrechten' kennen,

tot en met een `recht op vrede' en een `recht op geluk'. Opnieuw

moet &eacute;&eacute;n begrip dienen als label voor alles wat

goed, mooi en nastrevenswaardig is.

<P>

De laatste jaren is er, op dezelfde wijze, een uitdijend heelal

te zien rond het begrip <U>veiligheid</U>.<a href="#5">(5)</a> Behalve over militaire

veiligheid spreken we nu over economische, sociale, ecologische

veiligheid en zelfs over `human security' als alles overkoepelende

doelstelling.

<P>

Van deze neiging tot imperialistisch woordgebruik zijn in elk

geval drie dingen te zeggen:

<P>

<OL>

<LI> Op zich zelf verdient het streven de aandacht te vestigen

of gevestigd te houden op de volle breedte van het scala aan armoede,

onrecht, onderdrukking en levensbedreiging ieders steun. Aandacht

voor die problemen wordt door de ernst ervan ten volle gewettigd.

<P>

<LI> Dat doel wordt echter niet gediend door alle problemen

met hetzelfde begrip aan te duiden. Integendeel, ons inzicht in

de oorzaken en onderlinge samenhang en daardoor in de oplossing

van die problemen wordt er waarschijnlijk door geschaad, en derhalve:

<P>

<LI> heeft de verruiming van het woordgebruik alleen politieke

en ideologische functies, die in het vlak van de `politieke correctheid'

liggen.

</OL>

<P>

Het komt er in feite op neer dat men met gebruikmaking van begrippen

die goed in de markt liggen en met het stijlmiddel van de analogie

en de metafoor verschuivingen in beleidsprioriteiten probeert

te bewerkstelligen en/of te legitimeren. Door onrecht of milieuvervuiling

onveiligheid te noemen kan men bepleiten niet alleen geld aan

militaire macht maar ook, of meer, aan hulp of milieubescherming

uit te geven (het gaat immers in beide gevallen om `veiligheid').

Onder het motto `veiligheid' kan de NAVO zich nu ook met het moslimfundamentalisme

gaan bezighouden. Je kunt dan ook bepleiten militaire operaties

uit het budget voor de ontwikkelingssamenwerking te betalen. Veiligheid

is immers het nieuwe woord voor ontwikkeling. Maar evengoed laat

zich een pleidooi voeren dat budget te laten groeien ten koste

van de defensieuitgaven. Voorkomen is immers beter dan genezen.

Kortom, wat vroeger vrede of, nog ouderwetser, gerechtigheid heette,

heet nu veiligheid.<a href="#6">(6)</a>

<P>

Over de vraag waar de problemen vandaan komen, hoe ze samenhangen

en wat we er eventueel aan kunnen doen, weten we ondanks alle

begripsverruiming echter nog even weinig als daarvoor, laat staan

dat de wereld op zich zelf er anders of beter door geworden is.

<P>

Hebben die verschuivingen in woordgebruik dan helemaal geen gevolgen?

Dat is niet het geval. Het gaat de voorstanders van de begripsverruiming,

zoals gezegd, primair om het bereiken van een verschuiving in

politieke prioriteiten in doelen en middelen in de richting van

het eigen belang en perspectief. Het woordgebruik is immers een

deel van de definitie van de situatie, die onder meer bepaalt

waar het probleem om draait en wie er aan tafel mogen zitten bij

het nemen van de beslissingen.<a href="#7">(7)</a> In de literatuur wordt het aangeduid

als `framing'.<a href="#8">(8)</a> Het is het probleem dat Alice ontmoet in het wonderlijke

land achter de spiegel, waar alles op zijn kop lijkt te staan

en anders heet: `The question is', zei Alice, `whether you c&aacute;n

make words mean so many different things'. `The question is',

zei Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master'.<a href="#9">(9)</a>

<P>

Ze mogen dan hun politieke functie hebben, vanuit wetenschappelijk

oogpunt zijn die uitdijende begrippen echter eerder verwarrend

dan verhelderend of vernieuwend. Gebruikt als pleidooi voor ontschotting

suggereren ze een eenheid en samenhang in de analyse van problemen

die nu juist eerst voorwerp van onderzoek moet zijn. Ze suggereren

causale samenhangen en analytische analogie&euml;n, maar bewijzen

die niet. Wat het oplevert zijn oppervlakkige metaforen met slecht

doordachte conclusies, zoals het toekennen van nieuwe taken aan

de marine bij de `oorlog tegen de drugs' of bij het verzekeren

van `milieuveiligheid', of het promoveren van soldaten tot de

nieuwe ontwikkelingswerkers.

<P>

Natuurlijk is het nodig na te gaan of het beleid verbeterd kan

worden door de problemen in hun samenhang te bestuderen. Een zogenaamd

holistische benadering waarin alles met alles samenhangt, is echter

slechts op het eerste gezicht diepzinnig. Essentieel is het juist

te onderkennen dat wetenschap precies het omgekeerde moet doen,

namelijk laten zien dat sommige dingen meer en andere juist niet

samenhangen, kortom reductie van de complexiteit. Dat is erg lastig

en verschaft helaas geen warm gevoel van binnen.

<P>

Essentieel voor het herijkingsdebat is ook te onderkennen dat

juist niet alles hetzelfde is en dat beleidsdoelstellingen niet

per definitie in elkaars verlengde liggen en integendeel elkaar

juist vaak in de weg zitten (groei versus milieu, mensenrechten

versus plezierige relaties, interventie versus zelfbeschikking,

vrede door kernwapens versus proliferatieproblemen versus civiele

kernenergie versus milieu, enz.). Natuurlijk moet iedere regering

in haar buitenlands beleid proberen deelbelangen en deelperspectieven

te verzoenen, maar dat is maar beperkt mogelijk en dan zijn, soms

pijnlijke, keuzen onvermijdelijk. Die kun je niet ontlopen door

te suggereren dat eigenlijk alles hetzelfde is en alles met alles

samenhangt. Als dat zo zou zijn, zou het tot de conclusie moeten

leiden dat het er niets toe doet of je het een of het ander doet

of waar je begint. Containerbegrippen helpen niet om de onmacht

bij het begrijpen van ingewikkelde samenhangen te overwinnen en

tegen elkaar in werkende processen precies te beschrijven en te

verklaren. Ze verhullen alleen.

<P>

<a name=nationaal></a><B>Het 'nationaal' belang als richtlijn?</B> 

<P>

Een tweede methode om de herijkingsdiscussie in te gaan en in

een bepaalde richting te sturen, is het gebruik van en beroep

op het begrip `nationaal' belang. Ik beweer niet dat nationale

belangen in het geheel niet bestaan, noch dat ze geen leidraad

moeten vormen bij de beleidsbepaling, wel dat de manier waarop

dat gebeurt meestal, al dan niet bewust, misleidend is.

<P>

Het is natuurlijk goed dat wordt erkend dat ook Nederland niet

uit louter idealisme handelt, maar &#190; net als andere staten

-belangen probeert te beschermen of te verwezenlijken. Zonder

geheel in subjectivisme te vervallen is het echter allereerst

evident dat vaak absoluut niet duidelijk is wat de nationale belangen

<U>in concreto</U> zijn. Daarover wordt in de overheidsdepartementen

en onder de client&egrave;les die zij vertegenwoordigen vaak fundamenteel

verschillend gedacht. Ook niet-materi&euml;le belangen kunnen

een nationaal belang vormen. Wat men als belang ziet, varieert

naar tijd en plaats, en naar de groep waartoe men hoort. Dat geldt

ook voor economische belangen (bijvoorbeeld vrijhandel versus

protectie). Pleiten voor het eigenbelang (of het belang van bepaalde

groepen) mag natuurlijk, maar de identificatie van particulier

en publiek belang die in het gebruik van het begrip `nationaal

belang' besloten ligt, is niet vanzelfsprekend. Spreken over nationaal

belang mag niet dienen om de vraag wie de baten opstrijkt en wie

daarvan de kosten dragen, te ontlopen.

<P>

Belangrijker echter is het feit dat rond een begrip als `het Nederlands

nationaal belang' drie sterk verschillende discussies worden gevoerd,

die vaak, zo niet constant, worden verward, zodat debatten over

dat nationaal belang meestal meer hitte dan licht verspreiden

en waardoor het begrip iedere functie als richtsnoer voor het

beleid verliest.

<P>

In de eerste plaats kunnen we belangen (dan vooral verstaan als

materi&euml;le belangen en ook wel aangeduid als `eigenbelang')

als motief voor een bepaald beleid onderscheiden van andere motieven,

zoals idealisme en altru&iuml;sme (voorbeeld: belangeloze humanitaire

noodhulp). Over de mate waarin het een dan wel het ander moet

prevaleren is een, politiek-ethisch, debat mogelijk dat op zich

zelf zinvol kan zijn.

<P>

Dat debat moet echter niet worden verward met een tweede discussie,

waarin het niet gaat om belangen tegenover andere waarden, maar

om belangen van Nederland tegenover die van andere landen (bijvoorbeeld

de benoeming van Nederlanders op hoge internationale posten).

In deze betekenis is het begrip nationaal belang wellicht nog

het minst onduidelijk, al kan <U>in concreto</U> nog verschil

van mening bestaan over wat precies in het Nederlands belang is.

Dat kan hier echter gevoeglijk buiten beschouwing blijven.

<P>

Een derde dimensie van de discussie over het begrip nationaal

belang is die waarbij het gaat om het `Nederlands' belang tegenover

het `internationaal' belang. Dat is de moeilijkste van de drie

discussies. Soms is een internationaal/wereldbelang ook een direct

Nederlands belang in engere zin, terwijl men natuurlijk kan betogen

&#190; al is dat een beetje een truc om moeilijke vragen te ontlopen

&#190; dat ieder internationaal belang indirect ook een Nederlands

belang is. Soms liggen beide niet in elkaars verlengde of zijn

ze zelfs tegenstrijdig. De vraag of nationale en internationale

belangen tegenstrijdig, dan wel verenigbaar of zelfs identiek

zijn en hoe ze moeten worden afgewogen, is vooral moeilijk te

beantwoorden naarmate we meer met collectieve goederen te doen

hebben. Nederland heeft uiteraard deel aan het collectief belang

bij vrede en stabiliteit in Europa, maar ligt veilig achter de

Duitse rug en zou wat dat betreft, zo laat zich betogen, ook best

zonder leger kunnen. Die besparing is dan een direct Nederlands

belang. Hoe moeilijk de discussie is, toont het debat over de

voor- en nadelen van het Nederlandse EU-lidmaatschap (nog daargelaten

of en hoe kosten en baten daarbij kunnen en moeten worden berekend).

<P>

Essentieel bij collectieve goederen is dat de consumptie door

de een consumptie door de ander niet in de weg staat. Daarom doet

zich steeds het `free rider'-dilemma voor, voor ieder afzonderlijk.

Voor iedereen is het van belang dat het goed wordt geproduceerd

(bijvoorbeeld een einde aan oorlogen en conflicten op de Balkan),

maar voor ieder afzonderlijk is het nog aantrekkelijker dat anderen

de kastanjes uit het vuur halen. In een klimaat waarin pleidooien

voor het opkomen voor nationale belangen op zich zelf in goede

aarde vallen, is het moeilijk weerstand te bieden aan de verleiding

op de treeplank mee te rijden. De vraag zal steeds zijn wat een

redelijke Nederlandse bijdrage is aan de verwezenlijking van collectieve

goederen. De 0,7%-norm voor ontwikkelingshulp bewijst hier haar

nut. Dergelijke afspraken over nieuwe vormen van `burdensharing'

zijn ook nodig waar het gaat om militaire inspanningen ten behoeve

van collectieve verdediging en optreden ten behoeve van collectieve

veiligheid en vredeshandhaving, maar ook wat betreft het opvangen

van asielzoekers en migranten, zeker voor het instandhouden van

een binnenlands politiek draagvlak. Een beroep op `nationale ambities',

zoals ten grondslag ligt aan de norm in de Prioriteitennota waarin

de Nederlandse militaire bijdrage is gedefinieerd, is onvoldoende

overtuigend om op den duur de vraag van het `Mourir pour Danzig?'

te ontwijken en een dam in stand te houden tegen begerige andere

departementen.

<P>

Het begrip `nationaal belang' is dus eerder versluierend dan verhelderend

en kan in het herijkingsdebat dus worden gemist. Dat betekent

uiteraard niet dat er wat betreft elk van de drie dimensies niet

kan en moet worden gedebatteerd over de vraag wat redelijk en

wenselijk is, hoe deelbelangen moeten worden afgewogen en wat

het relatief gewicht van doelstellingen en prioriteiten moet zijn.

Een centrale plaats moet daarbij de vraag innemen wat een redelijke

Nederlandse bijdrage is aan de verwezenlijking van internationale

belangen en collectieve waarden en goederen. Vooral dit laatste

is bij de herijkingsdiscussie van groot belang. We willen hopelijk

geen <U>free rider</U> zijn, maar al te goed is buurmans gek.

Dat is zo, zowel om morele redenen als uit oogpunt van effectiviteit:

wat wij zouden doen hoeft een ander immers minder te doen. Die

discussies zijn niet eenvoudig. Wat echter alleen bij het punten

scoren helpt, is het dooreen halen van de dimensies van het debat.

<P>

<a name=linkerhand></a><B>De linkerhand en de rechter</B> 

<P>

Hierboven noemde ik al het gegeven dat binnen de overheid de linkerhand

vaak niet weet wat de rechter doet, of zelfs weet dat de rechter

hetzelfde of iets anders doet, maar niet bij machte is dat te

verhinderen. Ik wees er ook op dat hierbij vaak de toverwoorden

`integratie' en `co&ouml;rdinatie' worden gebruikt als hulpmiddel

tegen de waargenomen kwaal. Discussie is mogelijk over de vraag

hoe dat het beste kan. Er laten zich verschillende modellen denken,

die ieder hun evidente voor- en nadelen hebben. Ik noem slechts

enige mogelijkheden:

<P>

<OL>

<LI>Een centrale en sterkere rol voor de minister-president

en het ministerie van Algemene Zaken, vooral vanwege diens rol

in de Europese Raad;

<P>

<LI>Een herstel en versterking van de traditionele co&ouml;rdinerende

rol van het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken en het voor de beleidsvoorbereiding

en -uitvoering onmisbare apparaat van de diplomatieke dienst (vooral

in multilateraal verband), met de `vakdepartementen' in een secundaire

rol;

<P>

<LI>Horizontale co&ouml;rdinatie tussen de betrokken ministers

en de belangrijkste departementen: in elk geval Buitenlandse Zaken,

Economische Zaken en Defensie;

<P>

<LI>Het instellen van een `superministerie' voor alle internationale

aangelegenheden, met uitvoerende rijksdiensten voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking

en eventueel militaire zaken onder staatssecretarissen.

</OL>

<P>

Maar ook andere formules zijn denkbaar. Doel is vooral het verminderen

van dubbel werk en de verhoging van de effectiviteit en <U>efficiency</U>

van het beleid. Co&ouml;rdinatie wordt uiteraard meer nodig naarmate

ten gevolge van internationalisering meer departementen intensiever

bij internationaal beleid en Brusselse besluitvorming betrokken

raken.

<P>

Problematischer is daarentegen de situatie, zowel vanwege de oorzaken

als vanwege het feit dat oplossingen minder makkelijk te bedenken

zijn, wanneer delen van de overheid tegenstrijdige en onderling

onverenigbare doelstellingen nastreven. Het is de vraag of `integratie'

en `c&ouml;ordinatie' dan veel soelaas kunnen bieden. Sommige

beleidsdoelstellingen zijn intrinsiek tegenstrijdig in die zin

dat ze elkaar in de weg zitten. Men kan bijvoorbeeld denken aan

de wens de NAVO in Oosteuropese richting uit te breiden en tegelijk

Rusland te vriend te houden; verdieping van de Europese integratie

onder gelijktijdige verbreding. Andere tegenstrijdigheden bestaan

wel, maar zouden wellicht door compromissen of door andere vormen

van beleid kunnen worden opgeheven. Zo kan men denken aan het

leveren van wapens aan landen die tegen ons gebruikt kunnen worden

in militaire VN-operaties waar Nederland bij betrokken is of geraakt;

het onder druk zetten van landen vanwege hun mensenrechtenbeleid,

terwijl men tegelijkertijd de politieke steun van de betrokken

landen zoekt; en het willen bevorderen van economische ontwikkeling

in Midden-Europa, terwijl men de grenzen gesloten houdt voor hun

produkten.

<P>

Sommige van die tegenstrijdigheden zijn eenvoudigweg het gevolg

van de verschillen in belangen, doelstellingen en perspectieven

van de departementen en hun client&egrave;les. Zij zijn daarom

maar in beperkte mate vatbaar voor een oplossing langs de weg

van integratie en co&ouml;rdinatie. Dat hangt immers samen met

de aard van de dilemma's. Die kunnen intrinsiek en extrinsiek

zijn.

<P>

<a name=dilemma's></a><B>Dilemma's: belemmering of <U>blessing in disguise</U>?</B>



<P>

Soms kan analytisch inzicht in de aard van samenhangen en tegenstrijdigheden

helpen bij het oplossen van tegenstrijdigheden en dilemma's, maar

veelal vereist dat oplossen simpelweg het doorhakken van politieke

knopen.

<P>

Dat de linkerhand niet weet wat de rechter doet of zelfs weet

dat die iets anders doet, is soms het gevolg van organisatorisch

of beleidsmatig onvermogen en zou dan in principe kunnen worden

verbeterd. Het is echter na&iuml;ef te denken dat analyse en reflectie

(het `grand debate') daar steeds uitkomst kunnen bieden bij alle

dilemma's. Natuurlijk is het beleid verkokerd en gecompartimentaliseerd

en daarmee suboptimaal in termen van effecitiviteit, maar dat

kan ook een <U>blessing in disguise</U> zijn, die ons lastige

politieke keuzen bespaart, vooral bij de allocatie van middelen.

<P>

Regeringen worden voortdurend geconfronteerd met de noodzaak te

kiezen. Soms gaat het louter om keuzen die worden afgedwongen

door schaarste aan middelen (geld, tijd, energie). Je kunt het

geld maar &eacute;&eacute;n keer uitgeven. In dergelijke gevallen

zijn compromissen vaak wel mogelijk. Interessanter en moeilijker

is het wanneer er sprake is van echte dilemma's en een keuze voor

de ene optie het bereiken van een ander doel belemmert en alle

keuzen (ook) negatieve effecten hebben. De keuze voor een nieuwe

helikopter voor het Nederlandse leger is een voorbeeld van zo'n

dilemma. Soms gaat het nog verder en gaat het om het kiezen tussen

twee kwaden.

<P>

Hoe doen regeringen dat? Het huidig onderzoek van de interuniversitaire

werkgroep `Buitenlands beleid van Nederland' (B4) is gewijd aan

een studie van de manier waarop regeringen met echte dilemma's

omgaan. Een groot aantal `strategie&euml;n' of methoden hoe in

beginsel met dilemma's kan worden omgegaan, is ge&iuml;dentificeerd

en aan de hand van vergelijkende <U>case studies</U> wordt onderzocht

onder welke omstandigheden welke strategie&euml;n worden gebruikt.

Ik noem er daarvan een paar: uitstel van de beslissing (`komt

tijd komt raad'), compartimentalisering van de besluitvorming

(de linker- en de rechterhand), van ondeelbare beslissingen deelbare

maken (toelating van Middeneuropese landen tot de NAVO, maar extra

hulp geven aan Rusland), misleiding (men zegt thuis iets anders

dan in het buitenland), enz. Ten slotte komt de vraag aan de orde

of dilemma's echt kunnen worden opgelost en wat daar voor gevolgen

aan vastzitten voor de richting van het beleid en inrichting van

de besluitvorming. Dit alles kan licht werpen op de vraag of `herijking'

en `ontschotting' van het beleid kunnen bijdragen aan het oplossen

van de (vele) dilemma's waarmee beleidmakers worden geconfronteerd.

<P>

<a name=concentratie></a><B>Concentratie van inspanningen gewenst</B> 

<P>

Ik sluit af met een paar conclusies, die overigens geen wetenschappelijke

status claimen. Eerder dan op de doelstellingen van beleid zou

ik &#190; ook al is het onderwerp wat minder `sexy' &#190; het

(herijkings)debat willen concentreren op de Nederlandse mogelijkheden

en op wat kan worden gedaan om de effectiviteit en <U>efficiency</U>

van de inzet van onze middelen (geld, energie, tijd, talent, mankracht)

te vergroten. Dat is nodig en relevant omdat die middelen niet

alleen eindig, maar ook beperkt zijn. Dat alles zal snel concrete

gevolgen hebben. Het debat over de doelstellingen kan daarentegen

in hoge mate vrijblijvend blijven, vooral als de vraag naar de

prioritering en de vraag wat voorrang verdient als doelstellingen

botsen, wordt ontlopen.

<P>

Bij dit alles bedenke men dat de buitenlands-politieke agenda

van Nederland voor het grootste deel door het buitenland wordt

bepaald, door de gebeurtenissen in de wereld en door de organisaties

waar wij lid van zijn. Onze autonomie is derhalve beperkt. Wat

voor beleid doorgaat, is grotendeels reactief van aard en dan

beperkt autonomie zich tot de keuze van de mate waarin men tijd,

geld en energie investeert in een bepaalde kwestie.

<P>

Er is echter ten dele ook, in ieder geval n&oacute;g, sprake van

echte autonomie. Afgezien van min of meer vastliggende verplichtingen

(de verplichte EU-bijdrage, NAVO-verplichtingen, de 0,7%-norm

op het gebied van ontwikkelingssamenwerking), is Nederland betrekkelijk

vrij in de prioriteit die het aan zijn internationale inspanningen

stelt. Bij het vaststellen van de noodzakelijke militaire capaciteit

gaat het eensdeels om NAVO-normen maar anderzijds, aldus de Prioriteitennota,

om een nationaal vastgestelde norm van deelname aan vier vredesoperaties,

als een kwestie van `nationale ambitie'. De ene norm is exogeen

bepaald, de andere endogeen. De afweging tussen `idealistische'

en `nationale' belangen is een ander terrein waarop de nationale

autonomie redelijk groot is.

<P>

Gegeven die beslissingsvrijheid bepleit ik concentratie van onze

inspanningen op een beperkt aantal zaken, vooral die waar Nederland

goed in is (qua expertise, middelen, nationaal draagvlak, consensus).

Die beperking en concentratie kan op vele terreinen worden gezocht:

op dat van de geografische grenzen (bijvoorbeeld wel militairen

naar Joegoslavi&euml;, maar waarom mariniers naar Cambodja of

Haiti?), of op het aantal landen dat ontwikkelingshulp ontvangt,

op specifieke delen van het mensenrechten- en milieu-terrein.

Eerder onderzoek toonde aan dat bij geconcentreerde aandacht,

met inzet van veel energie en wanneer een aantal voorwaarden is

vervuld (zoals persoonlijke betrokkenheid van de bewindsman, consensus

binnenslands en steun van een of meer grote bondgenoten [de samenwerking

met Duitsland springt hier in het oog]) de Nederlandse invloed

wel degelijk mogelijk en soms zelfs aanzienlijk kan zijn.<a href="#10">(10)</a> Dat

betekent dat het herijkingsdebat geen irrelevante exercitie hoeft

te blijven.

<P>

Buitenlandse politiek betekent voortdurend kiezen tussen vaak

hoogst onzekere alternatieven binnen nauwe marges. Een helder

analytisch kader kan daarbij helpen om tegenstrijdigheden in doelstellingen

en werkwijze te identificeren en om optimaal gebruik te maken

van de beschikbare hulpbronnen. Oplossing van de echte dilemma's,

voor zover ooit mogelijk, vergt echter meer. Meestal kan noch

een beroep op het nationaal belang, noch het spelen met woorden

daarbij de oplossing brengen. Het probleem zit hem minder in de

doelstellingen dan in de optimale organisatie en aanwending van

middelen en instrumenten.

<h2>2.2 Donor-driven policies</h2>

In the poorer countries, donors can be the single most important source of health financing. Where foreign aid forms a vast proportion of the country's overall health budget, a situation arises where donors dictate policy. They allocate resources for certain priorities for a certain period of time. This results in local governments becoming almost entirely dependent on international donors: it is a case of whoever controls resources, controls policy.<p>

From such a position of power, donors and their agents make decisions about policy that may be governed by factors that distract from the real needs of the countries they seek to help.<p>

Uganda, for example, has seen five different national health plans since 1986; National Relief Plan 1986; Rehabilitation and Development Plan 1987; Ten Year Plan 1990; Three Year Plan 1992; and National Plan of Action for Children 1992. Mostly the brainchild of different donors, each reflected what donors thought should be Uganda's health priorities. None stood as the national document; different donors have worked to different planning documents while the government sought approval for its own preferred plan. On the ground, district medical officers could find themselves dealing with up to 16 separate donor-funded vertical programmes, sometimes conflicting with each other.<p>

At times the donor's agenda is an organisational one: the need to return to head office with results that are consistent with the agency's ethos and goals. At others, political expediency governs the decisions reached by donor countries. And sometimes, changes in international health policy trends come more frequently than changes in the health priorities on the ground.<p>
<p>

<h3>The quick fix mentality</H3>

<i>"Congress likes to keep things simple. These are the sorts of indicators they like. USAID is forced to use these indicators because of Congress' quick fix mentality." </i> USAID spokesperson<p>


Long-term benefits take at least five years to show themselves and several generations of children to prove themselves sustainable. Donors and international agencies cannot wait that long. They are under pressure to measure the success of pilot phases and campaigns - by their nature short-term - in terms of the number of children immunised, the number of contraceptives distributed, the number of latrines constructed.<p>


These serve as proxy indicators for a more uncertain distant future and satisfy investors' needs for results during the period of investment.<p>

Donors are very restricted in their ability to create sustainable health systems in the current mould. Aid ministries in western countries are under continual pressure to justify their budgets to treasuries and to their governments as a whole.<p>

<font size=4><b>Ghana</b></font> is just one example of several countries which were lagging when the 1990 target for 80 per cent immunisation loomed and which launched countrywide immunisation campaigns to boost coverage. The value of immunising maximum numbers of children was widely accepted. But to reach the target, health staff were forced to stop other health services in order to carry out the campaign.<p>


In Ghana, a dramatic peak in coverage was recorded followed by a drastic trough as focus shifted elsewhere.<p>


<i>In 1990, when 80 per cent coverage was reached, the campaigns were stopped and money for immunisation activities was quickly withdrawn. Previously we were funded to do mass immunisation. We had money for fuel. Now that this money is not coming, we cannot immunise and coverage has come down. We are now stuck to think of other ways within our resources to improve coverage".</i>
<center>District medical officer, Ghana</center><p>
<p>
Excessive use of targets seemed to overshadow the importance of building up the structures to continue to meet targets once donors left, according to officials in Ghana.<p>


<i>"If the process is donor-driven but designed in a way that ensures that government can take over, it creates a sense of purpose and ownership. If targets and activities are determined only by the donor and for the donor, the intervention is less likely to be sustained."</i><p>
<center>Ministry official, Ghana</center><p>


Health officials came to feel that donors had created an artificial environment by the way in which they introduced and implemented the immunisation campaign.<p>


A more sustainable integrated programme now under way is reaping results: five out of ten regions are now achieving an increase on 1990 coverage levels.<p>
<p>

<h3>Shifting Political interests</h3>

The political upheavals of the early nineties which changed the balance of world power led to a shift in donors' interests from Cold War politics (which in some ways benefited many of the poorer countries where donors vied for strategic advantage) towards more domestic and regional concerns within Europe, the USA and the former Soviet Union.<p>
<a name="mozambique's">
<font size=4><b>Mozambique's</b></font> </a>health sector is overwhelmingly donor-dependent: over 90 per cent of the development budget and 60 per cent of running costs are funded by donors.<p>


Mozambique is an example of a country which is almost entirely dependent on donors. Foreign aid forms a vast proportion of its overall health budget.<p>
 
It is also an example of a country highly susceptible to foreign influences. Its strategic interest for western governments during the Cold War led to the arrival of numerous international donors when the peace agreement was singed in 1992.<p>


Faced with an absence of infrastructure or administration after the war, donor agencies worked in isolation, each dictating policies which led to inevitable competition and duplication. The government, financially powerless and lacking a strong civil service cadre and skilled health staff, was too weak to be able to regulate this.<p>


Now donor support is beginning to wane. The country has lost its strategic interest for the West and donors are increasingly moving their limited investment away from Africa. In 1996 the Danish government agency DANIDA is withdrawing its funding from Mozambique's Expanded Programme of Immunisation to concentrate on other development programmes. With the emergency now over, Medecins Sans Frontires (MSF) is also pulling out of health care work in Zambesia province.<p>

Because non-government organisations (NGOs) and donors have not been working in support of national structures, when they go, they leave few benefits behind them. The level of foreign aid in Mozambique, the extent to which donors have dictated policy, and the political expedience of their assistance are threatening the country's long-term capacity to sustain health care.<p>

in rich countries cut aid to the world's poorest communities,

say non-governmental organisations from 27 countries in the 1996

<I>Reality of Aid</I>.

<P>

The fourth annual <I>Reality of Aid</I> report notes the contribution

made by aid in halving child death rates and a 30% reduction in

malnutrition over the last 30 years.

<P>

But in spite of commitments by donors to social development and

poverty eradication at the UN Social Summit in March 1995, the

report shows that 8 out of 21 donors cut their aid in 1994, with

a further 4 only managing to maintain their aid as a percentage

of GNP.

<P>

Although every donor (except the USA) has reaffirmed its commitment

to the UN 0.7% aid target within the last 5 years, aid in 1995

looks set to fall to its lowest level ever.

<P>

The report points out that by cutting $6 billion from aid programmes

in 1993, governments saved just 1.8 cents out of every thousand

dollars of public expenditure.  $6 billion dollars would have

paid for universal access to safe and reliable family planning.

<P>

The report welcomes donor policies that emphasise investment in

people,  but points to the gulf between these policies and statistices

which show no increase in spending on the two key areas of health

and education.

<P>

Figures published for the first time in 1995 show almost unbelievably

small expenditures - just 0.1% of total aid allocated to basic

education (things like primary schools and adult literacy) and

just 0.3% to basic health.  The average amount spent by donors

on water and sanitation is just 4%.

<P>

The gulf between donors' rhetoric and actions is a key theme of

the <I>Reality of Aid</I>.

<UL>

<LI>OECD donor countries support the principle of free trade and

market mechanisms - yet their tying of aid reduces competition

and therefore costs recipient countries and estimated $2 billion

in overpricing;

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Donors stress good governance, human rights and the need for

recipients to reduce military spending.  But such considerations

are often submerged under the weight of commercial pressures as

donors compete for markets;

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Donor commitment to poverty reduction, aid coordination and

long term development has not led to any noticeable moves towards

effective concentration by individual donors on those countries

which are most vulnerable:

</UL>



<P>



<P>

Least Developed and other Low Income Countries have seen their

share of aid fall by 7% since 1990.  Bilateral aid to Sub Saharan

Africa has now fallen consistently in real terms for the past

five years.  Since 1991, donors have reduced aid by $670 million

- more than the entire national income of Sierra Leone.

<P>

Spending by official aid agencies on emergencies has quadrupled

over a decade to about $6 billion in 1994 - reducing the levels

available for long term development programmes

<P>

The <I>Reality of Aid</I> criticises OECD governments for their

lack of leadership and for failing to foster political commitment

to poverty eradication.

<P>

In 1996, the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty,

the <I>Reality of Aid</I> calls on governments to:

<UL>

<LI>Set time bound targets for reducing overall poverty and for

the eradication of absolute poverty;

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Restore aid to a growth path, at the very least, maintaining

aid at the 0.33% average.  Between now and the end of the century

all donors are called upon to ensure positive annual growth in

aid as a percentage of GNP;

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Allocate fifty per cent of ODA for direct investment in social

development;

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Find the $34 billion a year which is needed to provide for

the global unmet demand for family planning, universal primary

education, clean water and safe sanitation, basic health care

and nutrition;

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Put in place measures to relieve the burden of multilateral

debt on the Least Developed Countries;

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Become more transparent and accountable for aid spending -

setting and reporting on specific targets for the allocation of

aid to poverty reduction.

</UL>



<P>



<P>

The <I>Reality of Aid</I> challenges donor governments to build

on consistent public commitment to humanitarian action.  It underlines

the need for donors to invest in public awareness and understanding

at home.

<P>

It urges governments not to squander aid in the narrow pursuit

of political or economic interest, but to see aid as an investment

- an effective catalyst which enables poor people to help themselves.

<P>

The <I>Reality of Aid</I> concludes that the eradication of poverty

is possible within our lifetimes.  The challenge is to find the

vision and sustained political commitment needed to complete the

task.<HR>

<h1 align=center>Homelessness - The Facts</h1>

<font size=4>It takes more than a roof over your head to make a home. Worldwide, more
than 1,600 million people live in 'life-threatening' and 'health-threatening'
conditions - overcrowded and lacking in basic services. <font size=2><b>1</b></font>  That's almost
a third of the world's population. </font><BR>
<BR>
<br clear=all><hr width=71%><p>

<h2 align=center>Under threat</h2>
<font size=4>No-one can feel at home when their life is threatened by illness and disease
because of where they live.</font><p>



<li>Case studies of cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America show that it
is common for at least 30% of the population to live either in illegal settlements
with little or no infrastructure or services, or in overcrowded and often
deteriorating tenements and cheap boarding-houses. <font size=2><b>1</b></font><BR>



<li>18 million people in Latin America suffer from Chagas disease and 100
million are at risk. Infection occurs in low-income families in rural areas
where poor housing provides breeding sites for the disease vector, the parasite
Trypanosoma cruzi.<font size=2><b>1</b></font><BR>
<li> The incidence of rheumatic fever in developed countries is reported to
be below 5 per 100,000 population, whereas in many developing countries,
among children living in populations with overcrowded living conditions,
it may approach 300 per 100,000. <font size=2><b>1</b></font><BR>
<li> 1.3 million homes in Britain are officially unfit for human habitation. <font size=2><b>2 </b></font><p>
<hr width=71%><p>

<h2 align=center>The burden of bad homes. <font size=2><b>3</b></font></h2>


<font size=4>Bad housing, poor diet and an unhealthy physical environment cause <b>tuberculosis</b> to flourish; poor sanitation and water supplies foster 
<b>diarrhoeal diseases</b>. This chart shows how many 'life days' <font size=2><b>4</b></font> are lost on average per person in each region of the world from these two 
causes alone</font>.

<p><br clear=all><hr width=71%><p>

<h2 align=center>Poor</h2>
<font size=4>Hundreds of millions of people who lack the basic resources needed to make
a decent home are left without one - and their number is growing. The
proportion of poor people in the world has fallen slightly, but with a rising
world population their total number is increasing fast. </font><p>

<li> During the 1980s average incomes were reported to have fallen by 10% in
most of Latin America and 20% in sub-Saharan Africa. In many urban areas
wages have fallen by as much as 50%. <font size=2><b>1</b></font><BR>
<li> A recent summary of studies on the incidence of poverty in individual
developing countries reveals levels regularly in excess of 50% of the population. <font size=2><b>6</b></font><BR>
<li> Inequality between rich and poor has grown as fast in the North as in
the South: average real wages in the US have not increased at all for the
past 10 years.<font size=2><b>1</b></font> <BR>
<li> One in three children in Britain lives below the poverty line. <font size=2><b>7</b></font>   <p>

<h2 align=center>Vulnerable</h2>

<br><br>

<font size=4>The combined populations of the US, Canada, Britain and Australasia (the
main reader countries of the NI) is about 371 million: the same as the number
of the world's poorest rural people who are forced to live where their environment
causes insecurity because of soil erosion, the threat of landslip or flooding
and other environmental hazards.</font> <font size=2><b>5</b></font><p>




<p>
<br clear=all><hr width=71%><p>

<h2 align=center>Megamyths</h2>

<br>

<font size=4>It is often assumed that millions of people are homeless because they have
migrated to the slums of Southern 'megacities'. But such cities still comprise
a very small proportion of the total population, both North and South:</font><p>

<li> In 1975 Mexico City was projected by the UN to have a population of 31.6
million by the year 2000: in 1994 the projection was reduced to 16.4 million;
for Cairo the projections have been reduced from 16.4 million to 10.7 million.
<BR>
<li> For most of the past 2,000 years the largest cities in the world have
always been in Asia and Africa: only briefly during the nineteenth century
and the beginning of the twentieth were more than half of the world's 10
biggest cities in Europe and North America.<p>

<b>( right: Megacities North and South</b>: per cent of total population. <font size=2><b>)1</b></font><BR>

<BR>

<br clear=all><hr width=71%><p>


<h2 align=center>Third World in the First</h2>

<font size=4>Only very rough estimates are made of the number of homeless people in the
wealthy countries of the 'North'; but all of them show that the number has
been increasing sharply.</font><p>

<li>In the US a very conservative estimate of the number of people sleeping
on the streets or in shelters increased from 125,000 in 1980 to 324,000
by 1990. <font size=2><b>9</b></font> <BR>
<li> Anywhere between 130,000 and 250,000 people sleep rough or in night shelters
in Canada. <font size=2><b>10</b></font><BR>
<li> In Britain, the number of 'households' (on average comprising more than
two people) officially accepted as homeless more than doubled from 62,920
in 1980 to 148,250 by 1992. <font size=2><b>11</b></font><BR>
<li> Conditions for poor people in the North are far worse than for the relatively
wealthy in the South: infant mortality rates on the Easterhouse housing
estate in Glasgow, Scotland (46.7 per 100,000 live births) are more than
double those in the S&atilde;o Caetano do Sol region of S&atilde;o Paulo,
Brazil (18 per 100,000 live births). <font size=2><b>12</b></font> <BR>
<li> The real numbers of homeless people are very much higher than official
statistics suggest; in Britain something like two million people are 'unofficially'
homeless or 'hidden', sleeping on friends' floors or in overcrowded conditions. <font size=2><b>11</b></font><BR>
<li> In the early 1990s around 18 million people within the European Union
were homeless or extremely badly housed. <font size=2><b>3</b></font>
<p>
<br clear=all><hr width=71%><p>

<br>

<h2 align=center>Reasons for Homelessness. <font size=2><b>11 </b></font></h2>

<br><br><br>
<font size=4>Detailed analysis reveals that 40% of those officially homeless in Britain
became so because parents, relatives or friends were no longer willing or
able to accommodate them.</font>
<BR>



<br clear=all><br><hr width=71%><p>

<h2 align=center>Refuge</h2>

<br>

<font size=4>Political repression, war, hunger and environmental degradation force increasing
numbers of people to flee their homes.</font><p>



At the end of 1994 some 23 million people qualified for international assistance
as official refugees. Of these nearly three million were from Afghanistan
and just over two million from Rwanda. The number of people 'displaced'
within their own countries by destitution, war or environmental degradation
doubles this figure. An estimated two million people are homeless in the
former Yugoslavia. <p>

<html><head><title>The world of our grandchildren</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img align=left hspace=3 src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo.gif"><h3>International<br>Planned<br>Parenthood<br>Federation</h3><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="ippf_info.html">IPPF</a></i><br clear=left><hr><h1>The world of our grandchildren</h1><b>by Halfdan Mahler</b><p><img align=right hspace=10 src="ippf_pix/ippf_grandchildren.gif">Dr Halfdan Mahler, outgoing Secretary-General of IPPF, has been honoured with the 1995 United Nations Population Award. In his acceptance speech, reproduced here, he put forward his vision and hopes for a better future for human kind, stressing that a better world can only be created if women are freed from oppression and enabled to use their strength for the benefit of all.<p>I can only accept this award with humility and pride as I try to visualize the world of our children and grandchildren as seen through the wishful eyes of their mothers and grandmothers in developing countries.<p>Will it be a world where women control their own reproductive lives?  Where women are equal partners with men at work and in the bedroom?  Where adolescents understand their sexuality and know how to control it?  Where children are born to parents who have chosen to have them, and who are ready to feed them and clothe them and love them?  Where, in even the poorest places on earth, people have reason to expect that hard work may lead to a better life?<p><h3>The flame of hope</h3>If we, collectively, succeed, our children and grandchildren will inherit such a world.  It will be a world, mind you, of 10,000 million people - double the current world population.  A world, no doubt, of inequalities and strains between peoples and between nations, and of continued stress on the environment.  But it will be a world in which the flame of hope burns brightly.  <p>If we, collectively, are unsuccessful, our children and grandchildren will inherit a very different sort of planet.  One inhabited by 15,000 million people, triple the current world population.  One where, far too often, childbearing is a woman's destiny, not her choice.  One where an even greater number of children are born to teenage mothers, blasting the hopes of both generations.  One where still more women are trapped by absolute poverty, pregnancy and perpetual fatigue.  One where still more desperate women with no other recourse, choose unsafe, illegal abortions and are maimed or killed in the process.  One where competition for dwindling resources sets group against group and nation more fiercely against nation.  <p>The prospect of failure is a dismal one.  The price in human suffering would be intolerable.  We must not fail.  But to succeed, we must be determined, we must be united, and we must be bold.  <h3>Stopping coercive motherhood</h3>If hope is to survive in every corner of our grandchildren's world, women everywhere must have the power to control their own fertility.  This is still a distant goal in the developing world with more than 50 million unwanted pregnancies and tens of millions of unwanted children born in just one year.  Indeed, millions of these unwanted pregnancies and motherhoods are nothing less than coercive from a woman's perspective.  <p>Surely, we can and must given women the power to reduce that number of unwanted pregnancies and motherhoods.  Couples and individuals have both a right and responsibility to determine the number and spacing of their children.  Individual choice is the ethical bedrock on which we must build, free from coercion and free from obstruction.  Any interference with this right to choose, for whatever cause, is morally repugnant.  Once we are clear about this, there is no contradiction between macrodemographic public strategies and microdemocratic private decisions.  <p>I am speaking of a fundamental human right that encompasses more than parenthood alone.  Women, men and youth have a right to make free, informed, and responsible choices regarding their sexual and reproductive lives.  <p>Damaging practices that infringe on these rights, such as premature marriage and female genital mutilation, must be abolished everywhere.  Abominations such as the selling of young women into prostitution must likewise be eliminated wherever this form of slavery persists. <h3>Making reproductive health a reality</h3>Thus far, the international community has been reasonably willing to acknowledge sexual and reproductive rights in the abstract. Winning agreement on principles is the easy part.  The real challenge lies in empowering women to exercise their rights.  Too many governments have been slow to provide the information, education and services women require.  Establishing sexual and reproductive health services costs money.  Frequently, it costs political capital too.  In many parts of the world, both kinds of currency are in short supply.<p>The unmet need for family planning services is vast.  Today, several hundred million couples and individuals on earth would like to regulate their fertility but cannot because they have no proper access to family planning information and modern contraceptive methods.  Reaching these people should be our top priority between now and the year 2000.  But these unserved or under-served people will not be easy to reach.  Many have been marginalized in the development process.  They may live in urban slums or in rural squalor where schooling and jobs are scarce. Some may be migrants or refugees driven from their homelands by poverty, oppression or war.  Their nutrition is poor and their primary health care minimal.  Our only hope of reaching them is through co-ordinated and co-operative actions by the public, non-governmental and private sectors. <p>Some of the people we must reach live in countries where they are deliberately denied family planning services.  The opponents of modern contraception are well-organized, determined, and politically astute.  Opposition to family planning comes from several extremist persuasions, but all of them share one feature in common:  they are the politicized creations of men.  This is an ideology invented by men, expounded by men and enforced by men.  But it is women who suffer its consequences.  <h3>Anti-women ideology</h3>I believe that thoughtful people everywhere are increasingly troubled by anti-women ideology parading int he robes of "religion" and "morality".  It is the opposite of moral.  It is immoral to exalt the rights of a fetus over the rights of a woman and her existing family.  It is immoral to give men rights and privileges and deny the same to women.  It is unconscionable to condemn women to a life of perpetual pregnancy and childbearing. If men cannot end this immorality, I am confident that women will.  As women around the world raise their voices in the 21st century, male-dominated institutions will either heed them or fade into irrelevance.  <p>In the coming decade, we must also become much more effective in reaching young people.  <p>Teenage pregnancy is epidemic in both the industrialized and the developing world.  Some 15 million girls aged 15 to 19 give birth every year.  Some 5 million others have abortions.  There are currently more than 500 million people between the ages of 15 and 19, and their numbers will mount for at least another century. Unless we act, the incidence of teenage pregnancy, abortion and STDs including AIDS, will continue to soar.  <p>Childbearing is especially risky for the adolescent mother and her infant.  Physically, adolescents are not fully developed. Births may be obstructed, or the infants may be small and weak. And few adolescents are emotionally ready to become adequate parents.  <h3>Educate and trust the young</h3>Of course, many teenage pregnancies are unintended.  Few young people who are sexually active use contraceptives, even when they are aware that they exist.  Many adolescent women then choose to end their pregnancies, adding to the danger by having abortions late in their pregnancies or by resorting to unsafe methods.  <p>Many adults object that telling young people about sexuality and contraception is actually inviting them to become sexually active.  This fear has no basis in reality.  In fact, young people who have had sexual education in school, coupled with enlightened discussions in society and at home, may actually delay becoming sexually active.  And when they do become active, they are likelier to use safe contraception. <p> And what are the alternatives?  To withhold information in hopes that young people won't think about sex on their own?  To tell young people to abstain from sex, even though we know full well that many of them will not abstain?  If we withhold information, we are failing the next generation, and failing them terribly. an unwanted pregnancy could be tragic.  An HIV infection could be fatal.  Leaving young people in the dark about pregnancy and AIDS is like sending them out to cross a minefield with a blindfold over their eyes.  <h3>Ending the abortion hypocrisy</h3>I want to say just one word more about abortion.  Many nations have tried to abolish abortion, but none have succeeded.  All they have managed to do is to drive it underground.  When women are weary from bearing children, when they cannot face yet one more pregnancy, they will risk their lives to avoid having another child.  Every year, tens of thousands of women die from unsafe, illegal abortions, and many more are disabled.  Is it not time to end the hypocrisy and to make abortion rare, safe and legal where it is not?  Above all, the only way to fight abortion is to provide all women everywhere with quality sexual and reproductive health care.  <h3>Let us work together</h3>So what kind of world will our grandchildren inherit?  I believe it will be the world of hope that I described at the start.  One that frees women to be productive as well as reproductive.  One that gives women the tools, including education, to produce goods and services as well as children.  Womanpower is a formidable resource for both social and economic development.  <p>None of us can create this world on our own but working together, we have an excellent chance of success.  <p> <hr><p>©Copyright IPPF 1995.<br><font size=-1>Pictures: Top:&copy;John Rowley/IPPF Middle & bottom &copy;Mark Edwards/IPPF</font><hr><a href="index.html"><img src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo2.gif"> IPPF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<h2 align=center> NEW INITIATIVE  BRINGS CLEAN WATER TO HEBRON</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>



     
     Save the Children will launch a new project which will bring a regular 
     supply of
     clean water to children and their families in the South West bank 
     district of
     Hebron, (recent focus of Israeli- Palestinian negotiations) on 
     Wednesday 29
     January.<p>
     
     Funded with a grant of $400,000 from the Overseas Development 
     Administration,
     the project will also involve local communities in the establishment 
     of a low cost
     refuse collection and sewerage system. This will reduce the  risk of 
     environmental
     health hazards and diseases now commonplace in densely populated urban
     neighbourhoods and refugee camps in the region. The project will be 
     managed
     jointly by Save the Children UK and US.<p>
     
     Frances Moore, Save the Children's UK  Regional Adviser for the Middle 
     East, said:<p>
     <blockquote>
     "Year round supplies of clean water are a luxury for many families in 
     the West
     Bank. This critical water shortage is just one illustration of how 
     children of all
     communities have been deprived of the conditions required for a normal 
     healthy
     development."
     </blockquote><p>
     She added:<p>
     <blockquote>
     "This project arrives at a crucial time in Hebron's history. Although 
     the peace
     process and recent events have raised new hopes and expectations, for 
     most
     families, their economic and social  situation is actually 
     deteriorating."<p>
     </blockquote>
     
     Tomorrow 24 January as part of an official ministerial visit, the 
     British Overseas
     Development Minister Baroness Chalker will visit a similar ODA funded 
     water and
     sanitation programme run by Save the Children in Qalqilia district in 
     the north-
     eastern part of the West Bank.<p>

pauvret&#233; urbaine a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; au ministre de la Coop&#233;ration au

d&#233;veloppement, J.P. Pronk.</b>

<p>

Le pr&#233;sent r&#233;sum&#233; contient une description du probl&#232;me tel qu'il a &#233;t&#233;

identifi&#233; par le Conseil, les r&#233;sultats de l'analyse de la question et de la politique actuelle, les

conclusions du Conseil et les recommandations concernant la politique du ministre de la Coop&#233;ration

au d&#233;veloppement.

<p>

<h3>La croissance des villes et de la pauvret&#233; urbaine dans le Tiers-Monde</h3>



Selon les pr&#233;visions des Nations Unies, 51 % de la population mondiale vivront dans les villes en l'an

2000: ce chiffre atteindra m&ecirc;me les 65 % en 2025, date &#224; laquelle la population mondiale sera

de 8,4 milliards de personnes, 4,4 milliards de cette population vivant dans les villes des pays en

d&#233;veloppement. Ce sont les villes, - aussi bien les villes principales que celles de moyenne importance

-, des pays en d&#233;veloppement notamment d'Asie et d'Afrique qui conna&icirc;tront une croissance

explosive. Du fait d'une structure d&#233;mographique d&#233;s&#233;quilibr&#233;e - grand nombre de

migrants jeunes et exc&#233;dents d&#233;mographiques &#233;lev&#233;s - la population continuera

encore longtemps d'augmenter plus rapidement dans villes qu'&#224; la campagne, m&ecirc;me si l'exode

rural devait se faire moins important.

<p>

On assiste &#224; une augmentation du pourcentage de la population urbaine vivant au-dessous du seuil de

pauvret&#233; en Am&#233;rique latine, en Afrique et en Asie. Si la population du Grand Sa&otilde;

Paolo a cr&ucirc; de 44 % entre 1970 et 1980, celle des quartiers populaires a augment&#233; de 446 %

dans la m&ecirc;me p&#233;riode. En 1985, plus d'un tiers des citadins vivait au-dessous du seuil de

pauvret&#233; en Asie (au Bangladesh, m&ecirc;me 86%). M&ecirc;me dans les pays d'Asie de l'Est et

d'Asie du Sud qui connaissent une croissance rapide de leur &#233;conomie, 10 % de la population urbaine

vit au-dessous du seuil de pauvret&#233;.

<p>

La pauvret&#233; absolue, mesur&#233;e en termes de revenus, est encore la plus importante dans les

campagnes. Et selon les statistiques, le niveau des infrastructures est plus &#233;lev&#233; en ville

qu'&#224; la campagne. Toutefois, un nombre croissant de citadins pauvres sont victimes de la

concentration de facteurs de pauvret&#233; interd&#233;pendants. La "vuln&#233;rabilit&#233;" est ce qui

caract&#233;rise principalement leur existence selon la perception des citadins pauvres eux-m&ecirc;mes.

Les citadins pauvres n'ont d'ordinaire pas acc&#232;s aux structures d'enseignement, aux soins de

sant&#233;, &#224; un logement ad&#233;quat, au cr&#233;dit ni &#224; d'autres facilit&#233;s de

travail et de revenu. Dans la plupart des villes du Tiers-Monde, une grande partie de la population active est

sans travail ou n'a qu'un travail temporaire; dans les villes, la population active - entre 15 et 65 ans -

cro&icirc;t g&#233;n&#233;ralement plus rapidement que l'ensemble de la population. L'offre de travail

des pouvoirs publics et des grandes et moyennes entreprises a diminu&#233; fortement dans les

ann&#233;es 80 dans un certain nombre de pays en d&#233;veloppement. La chute des salaires r&#233;els

dans le secteur public et dans les grandes entreprises et le nombre &#233;lev&#233; de ch&ocirc;meurs ont

&#233;galement fait baisser les salaires r&#233;els dans le secteur dit informel. La protection sociale des

travailleurs a s&#233;rieusement d&#233;clin&#233;.

<p>

Les citadins pauvres manquent de r&#233;seaux sociaux, d'influence sur les d&#233;cisions politiques et de

contr&ocirc;le sur leurs conditions de vie. Les administrations urbaines ne poss&#232;dent pas, en

g&#233;n&#233;ral, la capacit&#233; de management ni les moyens pour s'attaquer efficacement &#224;

ce probl&#232;me complexe. De nombreux citadins pauvres n'en parviennent pas moins &#224; rehausser

effectivement leur niveau de vie. Dans un certain nombre de villes, des organisations d'habitants de

bidonvilles r&#233;ussissent souvent &#224; atteindre des objectifs tr&#232;s concrets (logement, eau). Les

conditions de vie m&#233;diocres des pauvres des villes se caract&#233;risent &#233;galement par des

probl&#232;mes psychosociaux: stress, d&#233;sorientation, instabilit&#233; et incertitude, renforc&#233;s

par les espoirs d&#233;&#231;us et l'inad&#233;quation entre le revenu et les tentations de la ville. Une

situation qui conduit souvent &#224; des explosions sociales, &#224; des formes de violence et de

criminalit&#233; - dont les jeunes sont tant les auteurs que les victimes -, &#224; la maltraitance des

enfants et &#224; la violence envers les femmes dans les m&#233;nages.

<p>

<h3>Les groupes les plus touch&#233;s</h3>



Le cercle vicieux de la marginalisation dans les villes touche principalement trois groupes de pauvres.

<ul>

<li>Les m&#232;res, notamment celles qui assurent le revenu d'une famille pauvre: les m&#233;nages

entretenus par les femmes. La mauvaise qualit&#233; de l'alimentation, de la sant&#233; et du logement

dans les bidonvilles, les longs temps de travail et les longs trajets affectent le plus les travailleuses enceintes.

<li>Les enfants des rues. En 1992, les enfants et les jeunes de 0 &#224; 24 ans constituaient 55,8 % de la

population des pays en d&#233;veloppement (en Afrique, 65 %). Le faible revenu familial des pauvres,

l'acc&#232;s limit&#233; au travail et la d&#233;sint&#233;gration de la famille jettent de plus en plus

d'enfants &#224; la rue. Selon les estimations, ils seraient actuellement quelques dizaines de millions de par

le monde. Les plus vuln&#233;rables sont encore une fois les filles de 12 &#224; 16 ans, et les

pr&#233;adolescents. Les enfants des rues sont contraints de se d&#233;brouiller tout seuls et tombent dans

la criminalit&#233; et la prostitution; ils sont utilis&#233;s par les cartels de la drogue et, en

Am&#233;rique latine, ils sont expos&#233;s &#224; la violence de la police et des escadrons de la mort.

<li>Les jeunes sans emploi. Le ch&ocirc;mage est particuli&#232;rement &#233;lev&#233; parmi les

jeunes jusqu'&#224; 25 ans. Le secteur informel et les petites entreprises leur sont peu accessibles; ils se

trouvent en outre en concurrence avec les adultes devenus ch&ocirc;meurs dans le secteur formel.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>La politique actuelle de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine</h3>



Dans son avis, le Conseil r&#233;pertorie les politiques d'un grand nombre d'acteurs dans le domaine de la

lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine. Il constate que les priorit&#233;s des pays en d&#233;veloppement,

des donateurs multilat&#233;raux et du ministre n&#233;erlandais de la Coop&#233;ration au

D&#233;veloppement ne concordent pas sur tous les points. Les autorit&#233;s des pays en

d&#233;veloppement ne consid&#232;rent qu'exceptionnellement le probl&#232;me des citadins pauvres

comme un probl&#232;me distinct. Une organisation comme la Banque Mondiale situe, elle aussi, la lutte

contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine dans le cadre g&#233;n&#233;ral du d&#233;veloppement urbain. Bien

que les priorit&#233;s politiques des Pays-Bas - travail et revenu, habitat et am&#233;lioration de

l'administration - ne soient pas diff&#233;rentes des priorit&#233;s des organisations multilat&#233;rales,

la forte orientation de la politique n&#233;erlandaise actuelle vers la lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233;

constitue une exception.

<p>

En r&#233;sum&#233;, le Conseil constate, en ce qui concerne la politique n&#233;erlandaise de d&#233;veloppement:

<ul>

<li>que la politique de d&#233;veloppement &#224; l'&#233;gard de la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;

urbaine est formul&#233;e comme une politique d'accompagnement, non seulement par rapport &#224; la

politique de presque toutes les organisations multilat&#233;rales concern&#233;es, mais aussi par rapport

&#224; celle de la plupart des pays en d&#233;veloppement.

<li>que la politique dans son ensemble n'est pas explicitement ax&#233;e sur les probl&#232;mes du

ch&ocirc;mage parmi les jeunes et sur l'absence de formation professionnelle, sur la situation des femmes

dans les villes et le probl&#232;me de l'environnement urbain, ni sur les possibilit&#233;s

particuli&#232;res qu'offre la politique n&#233;erlandaise pour aider &#224; r&#233;soudre les

probl&#232;mes dans les villes d'importance secondaire. D'apr&#232;s les publications, il n'appara&icirc;t

pas que les programmes prioritaires "Les femmes et le d&#233;veloppement" et "L'environnement" ont

int&#233;gr&#233; l'aspect urbain dans leurs activit&#233;s. Le Conseil estime que le ch&ocirc;mage des

jeunes est un domaine important auquel on n'a toujours pas accord&#233; d'attention.

</ul>

<p>

Le Conseil reconna&icirc;t l'importance des programmes de la FMO (soci&#233;t&#233; financi&#232;re

n&#233;erlandaise pour les pays en d&#233;veloppement) et du programme PUM (programme de

d&#233;tachement de managers) pour g&#233;n&#233;rer de l'emploi dans les pays en

d&#233;veloppement.

<p>

<h3>Les principes de la politique de la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;</h3>



La principale conclusion du Conseil est que, vu la nature et l'urgence croissante qu'il y a &#224; combattre

la pauvret&#233; urbaine, il est n&#233;cessaire de formuler une politique distincte &#224; cet

&#233;gard. Le Conseil part du principe que la politique de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine fait partie

int&#233;grante de la politique g&#233;n&#233;rale de d&#233;veloppement n&#233;erlandaise.

<p>

Le Conseil consid&#232;re que l'aide bilat&#233;rale n&#233;erlandaise pour la lutte contre la

pauvret&#233; urbaine doit se limiter aux villes qui ne comptent pas plus de un ou deux millions

d'habitants, ne serait-ce que pour la simple raison que les Pays-Bas ne peuvent pas s'appuyer sur une

exp&#233;rience dans l'administration de villes plus grandes. &Eacute;tant donn&#233; la nature

structurelle du probl&#232;me, les Pays-Bas devront opter pour une coop&#233;ration de longue

dur&#233;e avec des "villes cibles". Le Conseil est &#233;galement d'avis que la politique

n&#233;erlandaise de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine doit cibler son action sur trois groupes

principaux: les m&#233;nages entretenus par les femmes (women maintained households), les jeunes sans

emploi et les enfants des rues.

<p>

La politique n&#233;erlandaise doit &ecirc;tre &#233;labor&#233;e sur la base d'une vision large et

int&#233;gr&#233;e et d'une aide-programme proj&#233;tis&#233;e. Vu les interd&#233;pendances

&#233;voqu&#233;es plus haut, l'amorce d'une solution au probl&#232;me de la pauvret&#233; urbaine

exige des interventions politiques &#224; diff&#233;rents niveaux administratifs et de diverses natures: la

valorisation des ressources humaines pour augmenter la productivit&#233;, l'am&#233;lioration de

l'administration et du management, une politique macro-&#233;conomique; la cr&#233;ation

d'&#233;quipements sociaux, la promotion de la participation et de la constitution d'organisations de

citadins pauvres; l'investissement dans des activit&#233;s &#233;conomiques et dans les infrastructures, en

relation avec l'am&#233;lioration de l'environnement urbain.

<p>

Le Conseil attache une grande importance &#224; la stimulation de la croissance &#233;conomique qui est

une condition n&#233;cessaire (mais insuffisante) de la lutte contre la pauvret&#233; en

g&#233;n&#233;ral et contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine en particulier. Il est n&#233;cessaire d'augmenter

la productivit&#233; dans de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement, malgr&#233; le risque de

ch&ocirc;mage &#224; court et &#224; moyen terme que comporte cet objectif.

<p>

Le Conseil est d'avis que la politique n&#233;erlandaise de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine doit tenir

compte de la mesure dans laquelle la politique de d&#233;veloppement men&#233;e par les autorit&#233;s

des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires int&#232;gre les cons&#233;quences qu'une telle politique

entra&icirc;ne pour les citadins pauvres.

Les Pays-Bas peuvent donc opter, sur cette base, pour une politique d'accompagnement ou de soutien de la

politique men&#233;e par ces autorit&#233;s ou organisations multilat&#233;rales, et pour le soutien de

certaines activit&#233;s d&#233;ploy&#233;es par exemple par des ONG locales. Le Conseil pense que

dans les pays o&ugrave; les autorit&#233;s nationales ne m&#232;nent pas de politique de redistribution, il

convient d'appuyer les ONG qui d&#233;fendent les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des pauvres, dans le but d'amener

les gouvernements concern&#233;s &#224; revoir leur politique.

<p>

<h3>Recommandations</h3>



Le Conseil recommande d'intensifier le Programme de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine afin de

pouvoir r&#233;aliser l'approche int&#233;gr&#233;e pr&#233;conis&#233;e dans les recommandations.

<p>

Le Conseil recommande de faire usage si possible d'un "indice de pauvret&#233; urbaine" dans le choix

des villes cibles.

<p>

Le Conseil fait une distinction entre la lutte directe et la lutte indirecte contre la pauvret&#233;. Il entend

par lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233; les activit&#233;s qui sont entreprises en coop&#233;ration avec

les groupes cibles cit&#233;s ou &#224; leur initiative. La lutte indirecte contre la pauvret&#233; comprend

des activit&#233;s qui ont pour but d'am&#233;liorer la situation des groupes cibles, sur laquelle ceux-ci

n'ont ni influence ni contr&ocirc;le, mais d&#233;termine n&#233;anmoins leur destin&#233;e.

<p>

<h3>La lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233;</h3>



Le Conseil recommande de promouvoir la lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233; dans les villes en

continuant &#224; soutenir directement ou indirectement les ONG, qui visent &#224; encourager les

pauvres &#224; se r&#233;unir en organisations et &#224; assurer l'accueil des enfants des rues. Il est

&#233;vident que la mise en oeuvre de la politique en faveur des jeunes sans emploi exige une

coop&#233;ration avec les MFO (organisations n&#233;erlandaises de cofinancement), les entreprises

n&#233;erlandaises - aussi bien les syndicats que les organisations patronales - et la SNV (Association

n&#233;erlandaise d'assistance au d&#233;veloppement), qui participent d&#233;j&#224; &#224; de telles

activit&#233;s. Le Conseil recommande d'examiner quelles sont les possibilit&#233;s envisag&#233;es par

ces organisations pour contribuer &#224; la formation professionnelle des jeunes et dans quelle mesure les

entreprises locales peuvent &ecirc;tre impliqu&#233;es dans ce type d'activit&#233;s.

<p>

Le Conseil recommande que les Pays-Bas contribuent &#224; la mise en place de filets de protection

sociale provisoires du type utilis&#233; en Bolivie et en Jama&iuml;que. Un tel fonds de

d&#233;veloppement social (Social Development Fund) devra imp&#233;rativement satisfaire aux conditions

qui sont n&#233;cessaires pour que les fonds disponibles profitent directement en particulier aux groupes

cibles cit&#233;s. Bien que dans un certain nombre de pays les salari&#233;s fassent partie des groupes

vuln&#233;rables lors de l'apparition de ch&ocirc;mage, le Conseil estime qu'ils n'occupent pas une

position d'exception &#224; cet &#233;gard.

<p>

Le Conseil recommande de tenir compte, dans le dialogue politique avec les pays en d&#233;veloppement

sur le probl&#232;me de la pauvret&#233; urbaine, des consid&#233;rations suivantes relatives aux

conditions de logement et d'existence dans les quartiers populaires:

<ul>

<li>l'accroissement de la faisabilit&#233; et de la durabilit&#233; des activit&#233;s par la participation

de la population &#224; la planification et &#224; l'ex&#233;cution;

<li>l'octroi du droit au logement et des droits fondamentaux et am&#233;lioration de l'infrastructure

urbaine par l'approvisionnement en eau potable salubre, l'assainissement et l'enl&#232;vement des

d&#233;chets;

<li>la cr&#233;ation de possibilit&#233;s pour des activit&#233;s li&#233;es &#224; l'agriculture - par

exemple la culture potag&#232;re et l'&#233;levage de petit b&#233;tail - ou l'autorisation l&#233;gale de

ces activit&#233;s dans les quartiers populaires;

<li>le moyen d'amener les petites et moyennes entreprises des quartiers populaires, par des activit&#233;s

de conseil, &#224; am&#233;nager les processus de production de fa&#231;on &#224; r&#233;duire la

quantit&#233; de d&#233;chets industriels et &#224; am&#233;liorer les conditions de travail en particulier

des groupes cibles dans ces entreprises, et

<li>l'am&#233;lioration de la qualit&#233; des prestations de services des autorit&#233;s urbaines.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>La lutte indirecte contre la pauvret&#233;</h3>



Le Conseil recommande d'appuyer la politique de la Banque Mondiale et du FMI visant &#224;

am&#233;liorer la structure &#233;conomique et la politique macro-&#233;conomique des pays

b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Il faut tenir compte &#224; cet &#233;gard des cons&#233;quences que cette

politique peut entra&icirc;ner pour les citadins pauvres. Au besoin, des activit&#233;s d'accompagnement

peuvent &ecirc;tre d&#233;ploy&#233;es, en particulier dans les villes cibles, par l'interm&#233;diaire du

canal bilat&#233;ral, sur la base d'une analyse de ces cons&#233;quences.

<p>

Le Conseil estime que la coop&#233;ration entre le Centre des Nations Unies pour les &#233;tablissements

humains (UNCHS), le Programme des Nations Unies pour le D&#233;veloppement (PNUD) et la Banque

Mondiale au sein du programme de planification urbaine (Urban Management Programme) m&#233;rite

d'&ecirc;tre soutenue davantage et recommande qu'on examine dans quelle mesure le choix des villes

&#224; op&#233;rer par les Pays-Bas et le recours &#224; l'expertise n&#233;erlandaise peuvent

&ecirc;tre pris en compte dans son ex&#233;cution. Vu l'absence de moyens des autorit&#233;s urbaines,

le Conseil recommande d'&#233;tudier dans quelle mesure les Pays-Bas peuvent participer aux Pr&ecirc;ts

de d&#233;veloppement urbain (Urban Development Loans) de la  Banque Mondiale, notamment  pour ce

qui est des volets relatifs &#224; l'am&#233;lioration de l'infrastructure urbaine.

<p>

Le Conseil recommande d'examiner sous quelles conditions il est possible d'amener des entreprises

n&#233;erlandaises &#224; investir dans des activit&#233;s &#233;conomiques dans les villes-cibles. Le

Conseil est convaincu que la demande de produits des petites entreprises est d&#233;termin&#233;e en

grande partie par les revenus des salari&#233;s des grandes et moyennes entreprises et des fonctionnaires.

<p>

Le Conseil recommande d'examiner s'il est possible de cr&#233;er par l'interm&#233;diaire des canaux

bilat&#233;raux et multilat&#233;raux, des conditions visant &#224; stimuler l'octroi de cr&#233;dits pour

la construction de logements au moyens de pr&ecirc;ts en devises locales. Il importe de poursuivre la

politique actuelle pour soutenir - surtout par le canal des ONG - des initiatives sur le plan de

coop&#233;ratives de cr&#233;dit.

<p>

<h3>&Eacute;tudes</h3>



Le ministre a &#233;galement demand&#233; au Conseil si des &#233;tudes sont n&#233;cessaires pour

augmenter l'efficacit&#233; de la politique de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine. Le Conseil a

identifi&#233; treize lacunes pouvant donner lieu &#224; une &#233;tude et estime qu'il est important,

dans chacune des &#233;tudes, d'int&#233;grer les perspectives des pauvres eux-m&ecirc;mes. Les cinq

principales lacunes sont les suivantes:

<ul>

<li>la perception du probl&#232;me urbain par les pauvres eux-m&ecirc;mes et les strat&#233;gies de

survie qu'ils ont d&#233;velopp&#233;es, en tant que points de d&#233;part de la politique;

<li>la conduite r&#233;guli&#232;re d'&#233;tudes dans les pays cibles et notamment dans les villes-

cibles sur les effets de la politique macro-&#233;conomique sur la pauvret&#233; urbaine;

<li>les conditions pour que les organisations de pauvres aient une influence r&#233;elle sur la politique

urbaine locale, dans le cadre de la politique des ONG et des administrations locales et nationales;

<li>le r&ocirc;le des ONG et des entreprises dans la formation professionnelle des jeunes;

<li>l'int&#233;gration et l'exclusion des migrants dans les villes et les strat&#233;gies de survie au

niveau des m&#233;nages, et en particulier des m&#233;nages entretenus par les femmes.

Britain's relations with Africa primarily via South Africa</h2>

<hr>

<b>Britain's African policy is dictated by pragmatic and economic

interests. Beyond this, London shows very little interest in the

continent. The Queen, on the other hand, is happy to imagine

herself in the Golden Age of the former British Empire.</b>

<p>

"Awfully pragmatic", was how Richard Dowden described Britain's

African policy. Great Britain's relations with the African

countries are primarily determined by the economic advantage that

Britain is likely to derive. Just as in colonial times, commercial

interests constitute the most important motive for British

involvement with the continent. "The consideration is purely in

terms of the scope of British investments in a country. If these

prove to be insufficient, the country in question is immediately

demoted. Diplomatic representation and development aid are being

scaled down," says Dowden, the African correspondent for the

renowned journal "The Economist."

<p>

During the eighties British investments in Africa were sharply

reduced. This development was further speeded up by the end of the

Cold War. "At that stage Great Britain was very much focused on the

enormous possibilities and opportunities opening up in Eastern

Europe. Eastern Europe seemed to be the future," according to

Dowden. Subsequently London was preoccupied with crises such as the

Gulf War. And the "Continentþ also began to exert an increasing

pull, says Adotey Bing, director of the Africa Centre in London. "I

think Great Britain opted for a stronger integration in Europe and

that Africa will henceforth be viewed from a European perspective."

<p>

The result has been that in recent years London has increasingly

turned its back on Africa. Diplomats were recalled. African

students are no longer encouraged to come and study at British

universities. And even the support of English-language radio

broadcasts within the continent is being run down. "In Africa you

come across members of the general public who ask: "Why isnþt

England helping any more?þ But the British Government appears to be

turning a deaf ear," recounts Dowden. He goes on to say:

"Essentially, Great Britain is no longer interested in its former

African colonies."

<p>

There is also great concern regarding the threatened cut-backs on

development cooperation. Oxfam is anticipating a cut of at least 12

percent over the total budget (bilateral aid currently amounts to

0.3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product). The cuts are also bound

to hit Africa. "Development cooperation is less important for Great

Britain now that there is no longer the political motivation for

it," says Bing. "Now that the African countries can no longer

appeal to the Soviet Union, the British Government can afford to

reduce development aid. Thus," according to Bing, "development aid

is focused less on political issues and more on economics."

<p>

The lack of interest at government level certainly does not also

apply to the British people. Correspondent Dowden was amazed by the

public response to the catastrophe in Rwanda. "Never was so much

money collected in so short a time as for Rwanda. The public forced

the government to extend official development aid to Rwanda. The

Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to send a diplomat to keep

track of the money sent. The same diplomat is still in Rwanda. It

was exceptional that the public appeal forced a government to take

measures when it would otherwise have been inclined to do far

less," says Dowden. Bing predicts that on an economic level Africa

will not be entirely abandoned. At the end of the eighties British

exports to Africa only accounted for 4 percent of the total

exports, but there are signs that exports to Africa are increasing.

Imports from Africa have also increased. In its traditional role of

supplier of raw materials, the continent will continue to carry a

certain relevance. "In view of the fact that London aspires to the

role of international trading centre, Africa is inevitably of

interest since that is where the raw materials come from," says

Bing.

<p>

Economic British-African relations centre on a handful of

countries. The list is headed by South Africa, followed by Nigeria.

In third place comes Kenya. As far as Great Britain is concerned,

South Africa offers the greatest prospects. For years the British

Government was at odds with the international community because

London was opposed to the economic sanctions on Pretoria. But with

the new South Africa the gates are wide open. "On an economic

level, British relations with Africa will primarily be determined

via South Africa," says Bing. Dowden shares the same opinion,

according to Dowden: "British economic interests are mainly

concentrated in South Africa. Britain can use South Africa as a

base from which to do business with the rest of Africa, especially

with the region." 

<p>

In its political approach to Africa, Great Britain prefers to adopt

the role of observer, a strategy which is an extension of the

method of "indirect ruleþ which London applied to the colonies.

Only in the case that matters really go too far will the British

Government be heard to voice loud protest. Thus the Kenyan

Government was put under heavy pressure to initiate a

democratization process in the country. London is a great deal more

cautious in its dealings with the powerful giant Nigeria, the

preference being given to 'silent diplomacy." As a rule, the

British Government is reticent in its response to political issues.

When it comes down to it, even the most faithful of African allies

are abandoned entirely to their fate.

<p>

This was experienced by the former president of Gambia, Dawda

Jawara. For thirty years Jawara was on Britain's side. Never once

did he criticize British policy with regard to South Africa. "He

was seen by the British as a shining example of how an African

leader should be," recounts Dowden. The Gambia maintained close

ties with Great Britain. The land was blessed with British

investments and British tourists. When John Major became Prime

Minister, and was of the impression that he needed to show Africa

that the continent was important to him, he decided to invite

Jawara for a special state visit. "But when Jawara was overthrown

by five officers demanding higher salaries, Great Britain did

absolutely nothing," says Dowden.

<p>

The British, says Bing, appear to have accepted the fact that the

Great British Empire no longer exists. This, however, does not mean

that the old colonial sentiments have entirely disappeared. Former

Prime Minister Thatcher seemed to have the utmost difficulty in

accepting the idea that the British Empire was a thing of the past.

And though the Commonwealth, which was once one of the most

important political organizations in the world, has lost a great

deal of its strength, the memory of the old alliance between Great

Britain and its former colonies is still cherished. "It's a nice

get-together," grins Dowden in speaking of the annual Commonwealth

reunion, where Her Majesty makes small talk with heads of state

from the former colonies and where problems can be discussed in an

informal way. "she knows all the heads of state, their families and

the ministers. She speaks with them along the lines of: "I knew

your grandfather." Dowden goes on to say: "There is currently a

relatively strong movement in Great Britain to put an end to these

top-level gatherings, but the Queen is attached to them. Because

not only does it make her the Queen of England, it also makes her

a kind of world player."

<p>

That the alliance is also useful as far as Africa is concerned can

be seen from the expected extension of the Commonwealth group of

states. Cameroon and Mozambique have both become members of the

Commonwealth. "The reasons for this are not so much economic as a

question of language," says Bing. The Portuguese-speaking

Mozambique wants greater connection with the surrounding

English-speaking countries, but has scarcely enough money for

English tuition. The Commonwealth could be helpful to Mozambique in

this respect. Bing: "I can imagine that as an institution the

Commonwealth will cease to exist, yet it will continue to function

as a cultural network."

'Panorama' looks at shocking new evidence that death rates among Britain's poor are rising for the first time in decades.  The rich are now living longer and the poor dying younger and, in some cases, that gap widened by as much as 45 per cent during the '80s.<p>Lorna and Rosa live a few hundred yards apart and both are expecting babies.  Lorna's baby can expect to live eight to 10 years less than Rosa's.  Rosa lives in a comfortable detached house, while Lorna lives in a one room sharing a single bed with her 10-year old daughter and with her possessions stored in black rubbish bags.<p>Inequality is increasing in Britain faster than any other industrialised country except New Zealand.  In some of the most deprived areas of Britain, there has been a real increase in death rates in the young and middle-aged for the first time since the '30s.<p>Alan has no job and lives on a run-down estate with his partner, Caroline.  They have both tried to kill themselves in the past and her brother has committed suicide.  They tell the programme that, in their view, poverty definitely kills.  In Scotland, the suicide rate for young men went up by a staggering 78 per cent in the '80s.<p>Yet, for the last 14 years, the Government has been reluctant to accept the link between poverty and poor health.  Dr Peter Phillimore, lecturer in social policy at Newcastle University, tells the programme: "There is sometimes a feeling that inequalities in health are always going to be with us, just as inequality is always going to be with us and what we are seeing is some kind of natural phenomenon.

<b>D&#233;but octobre 1993, l'avis du Conseil Consultatif National pour la Coop&#233;ration au

D&#233;veloppement sur la relation entre la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement et le

probl&#232;me des r&#233;fugi&#233;s a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; au ministre de la

coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, M. J.P. Pronk.</b>

<p>

<h3>La question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s. Probl&#232;mes mis en &#233;vidence par le Conseil</h3>



Comment la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement peut-elle contribuer &#224; emp&ecirc;cher

l'apparition de flux massifs de r&#233;fugi&#233;s et &#224; combattre et/ou &#224; pr&#233;venir leurs

effets n&#233;gatifs? Comment soutenir les pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires (en particulier les pays en

d&#233;veloppement) dans l'accueil de r&#233;fugi&#233;s et de personnes d&#233;plac&#233;es, a

demand&#233; le ministre lorsqu'il a sollicit&#233; un avis sur la question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s. Et

comment soutenir des solutions durables - outre l'accueil dans la r&#233;gion - au probl&#232;me des

r&#233;fugi&#233;s? En effet, le nombre de gens qui fuient leur pays est aujourd'hui plus grand que

jamais. D'apr&#232;s les estimations, vingt millions de personnes ont aujourd'hui quitt&#233; leur patrie.

Plus encore, un nombre &#233;quivalent de personnes ont &#233;t&#233; chass&#233;es de leur foyer

&#224; l'int&#233;rieur m&ecirc;me de leur pays. Il s'agit pour la majeure partie de femmes et d'enfants

de pays en d&#233;veloppement, fuyant vers d'autres pays en d&#233;veloppement. Une grande partie

d'entre eux attend, parfois depuis des dizaines d'ann&#233;es, dans des camps sordides. Le pr&#233;sent

avis porte en particulier sur l'aide &#224; apporter &#224; ces personnes - il ne s'agit nullement ici des

personnes venant chercher un travail en Europe - tout en &#233;voquant les mutations qu'a subies la notion

de r&#233;fugi&#233; au cours des derni&#232;res d&#233;cennies. Le Conseil se situe dans le droit fil de

la politique d&#233;velopp&#233;e par le HCNUR, l'organisation de l'ONU pour les r&#233;fugi&#233;s.

<p>

En ce qui concerne les possibilit&#233;s de contribution de la Coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement

&#224; la solution du probl&#232;me des r&#233;fugi&#233;s, nous ne pouvons qu'&#233;mettre des

r&#233;serves. En effet, il est presque impossible de r&#233;pondre &#224; la question de savoir dans

quelle mesure le sous-d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique  a contribu&#233; &#224; l'apparition de

flux de r&#233;fugi&#233;s. Le lien entre l'in&#233;galit&#233; &#233;conomique et les bouleversements

sociaux violents est tr&#232;s complexe. N&#233;anmoins, la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement

est de plus en plus consid&#233;r&#233;e comme un instrument pr&#233;ventif et l'on sp&#233;cule sur la

r&#233;duction du nombre de demandeurs d'asile par le "d&#233;veloppement" des r&#233;gions pauvres.

Du fait qu'une telle politique serait une prime &#224; la mauvaise gestion, il s'agit d'une formule qui ne

tient compte en aucune fa&#231;on de l'impr&#233;visibilit&#233; de la question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s.

Selon le Conseil, le sous-d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique n'est pas en lui-m&ecirc;me la cause

principale de l'&#233;mergence de flux de r&#233;fugi&#233;s.

<p>

On peut m&ecirc;me se demander si les conflits ne sont pas inh&#233;rents au processus de

d&#233;veloppement lui-m&ecirc;me. Le d&#233;veloppement implique en effet une mutation sociale,

l'apparition d'une nouvelle situation pour les groupes de population et pour les relations entre les gens et

leur environnement. Cela va rarement sans coup f&#233;rir. Certains critiques estiment que la crise

&#233;conomique, et la violence qui lui est inh&#233;rente (comme la progression de la criminalit&#233;

(inter)nationale, les conflits violents, les guerres civiles, le trafic de drogue et la d&#233;t&#233;rioration

de l'environnement) sont une cons&#233;quence du mod&#232;le de d&#233;veloppement dominant, qui

est fond&#233; sur des normes occidentales.

<p>

D'autre part, la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement est &#233;galement consid&#233;r&#233;e

comme un moyen possible de pr&#233;vention de conflits entra&icirc;nant des flux de

r&#233;fugi&#233;s. De meilleures conditions de vie pourraient emp&ecirc;cher l'apparition de conflits

caus&#233;s par le d&#233;nuement, la d&#233;gradation de l'environnement ou l'in&#233;galit&#233;

&#233;conomique. Mais, comme il a d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; dit, les causes des flux de

r&#233;fugi&#233;s sont multiples: constitution d'&Eacute;tats ou de nations, d&#233;colonisation -

 compliqu&#233;s ou non par des facteurs &#233;conomiques -, &#233;volution des institutions ('soft

state', &Eacute;tat faible) sans oublier la d&#233;t&#233;rioration de l'environnement. Dans ces

conditions, la violation des droits de l'homme, la violence meurtri&#232;re et les catastrophes naturelles et

&#233;cologiques incitent les gens &#224; fuir en masse, que ce soit devant la r&#233;alit&#233;

collective des "pers&#233;cutions", ou pour le motif plus personnel de la peur. Cela est en rapport

&#233;troit avec le changement d'identit&#233; des habitants de pays en d&#233;veloppement,

g&#233;n&#233;r&#233; entre autres par l'&#233;ducation et le d&#233;veloppement, et avec

l'&#233;mergence d'une nouvelle individualit&#233;. Des valeurs telles que l'autonomie, la libert&#233;

individuelle, la responsabilit&#233; propre, le respect mutuel et surtout la garantie de l'int&#233;grit&#233;

physique acqui&#232;rent ainsi - certainement pour les jeunes - une signification plus grande. Cela implique

que la violence sociale est plus souvent jug&#233;e comme injuste et inadmissible, ce qui peut aboutir

&#224; une radicalisation politique et donc &#224; une fuite forc&#233;e. Dans le m&ecirc;me temps, la

participation &#224; des processus politiques scl&#233;ros&#233;s se r&#233;duit de plus en plus et

l'action collective ne constitue plus &#224; vrai dire une option. Il ne reste donc plus aux jeunes des pays

du Sud, conscients de tout cela, qu'&#224; quitter leur pays. Les motifs &#233;conomiques ne sont

certainement pas la raison principale de leur d&#233;part. La plupart d'entre eux resteraient s'ils se savaient

&#224; l'abri de la violence ou des caprices d'une tyrannie impr&#233;visible.

<p>

<h3>Conclusions et recommandations</h3>



En cons&#233;quence, le Conseil estime que la politique de d&#233;veloppement doit &ecirc;tre davantage

fond&#233;e sur la notion de diversit&#233; sociale, &#233;conomique et culturelle comme base d'un

d&#233;veloppement librement choisi et mis en oeuvre &#224; partir de la base. &Agrave; long terme, une

telle politique peut avoir un effet pr&#233;ventif ou du moins mod&#233;rateur quant &#224; la

polarisation et les expressions violentes de l'individualit&#233; fondamentale (fondamentaliste). En outre,

comme le constatait l'avis n&#186; 100 du NAR, de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement connaissent

une situation de croissance d&#233;viante, o&ugrave; la construction de la soci&#233;t&#233;

pr&#233;sente un caract&#232;re unilat&#233;ral et est domin&#233;e par les institutions

&#233;conomiques ou par un appareil &#233;tatique d&#233;mesur&#233;. Cela provoque souvent des

tensions sociales, qui donnent parfois lieu &#224; une opposition violente, et constitue un obstacle &#224;

la recherche d'un d&#233;veloppement durable.

<p>

Dans ce cadre, le Conseil estime qu'il est essentiel de promouvoir les droits de l'homme. Des mesures telles

que le syst&#232;me d'alerte rapide  (early warnings), la pr&#233;sence physique d'organisations

internationales et la promotion d'une bonne administration peuvent avoir un effet pr&#233;ventif direct. Le

Conseil recommande de soutenir les organisations de d&#233;fense des droits de l'homme,

pr&#233;cis&#233;ment lorsque les violations de ces droits augmentent. Dans le prolongement de ce

soutien, il importe &#233;galement de coop&#233;rer avec les organisations sensibles aux droits de

l'homme, comme les syndicats et les mouvements f&#233;ministes. Il est aussi souhaitable de faire

tr&#232;s t&ocirc;t des rapports sur les d&#233;veloppements en mati&#232;re de violations de droits de

l'homme. Les ambassades devraient &#233;galement rendre compte de l'application des lois, des

d&#233;buts d'incidents tels que les disparitions, incarc&#233;rations et ex&#233;cutions. Rendre

fid&#232;lement compte des violations des droits de l'homme et de l'apparition des flux de

r&#233;fugi&#233;s, envoyer des journalistes en reportage ou en inviter et faire r&#233;aliser des

documentaires en coop&#233;ration avec les journalistes des pays concern&#233;s, pourrait contribuer

&#224; faire prendre conscience de ce probl&#232;me. En raison du renforcement de la

conditionnalit&#233;, tous les pays industrialis&#233;s devraient se d&#233;clarer pr&ecirc;ts &#224;

accepter une surveillance internationale du respect des droits de l'homme dans leur propre r&#233;gion,

comme la plupart des &Eacute;tats europ&#233;ens l'ont fait en signant la Convention de Strasbourg.

<p>

Le Conseil veut attirer une nouvelle fois l'attention sur le fait que 80% des r&#233;fugi&#233;s au niveau

mondial sont des femmes et des enfants. Il serait utile de faire remarquer cette donn&#233;e dans un

contexte bilat&#233;ral et multilat&#233;ral et d'harmoniser la politique sur ce point.

<p>

En ce qui concerne les d&#233;penses des Pays-Bas en mati&#232;re d'aide aux r&#233;fugi&#233;s (y

compris l'accueil de demandeurs d'asile), le Conseil constate avec grande inqui&#233;tude que les

r&#233;fugi&#233;s des pays en d&#233;veloppement n'ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; que de 35% du

montant total qui y a &#233;t&#233; consacr&#233; en 1992 dans le cadre de l'aide au

d&#233;veloppement. Dans les ann&#233;es &#224; venir, ce pourcentage risque de diminuer encore plus.

Le Conseil insiste pour que l'on inverse cette tendance et pour que l'accueil des demandeurs d'asile aux

Pays-Bas ne soit plus imput&#233; au budget de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement.

<p>

Il convient &#233;galement de soutenir l'accueil dans la r&#233;gion sans toutefois perdre de vue que pour

certains r&#233;fugi&#233;s, la r&#233;gion "culturelle" se situe plut&ocirc;t en Occident que dans les

pays voisins de leur patrie. Il e&ucirc;t &#233;t&#233; inad&#233;quat de renvoyer dans un des camps du

subcontinent les partisans pakistanais de Bhutto venus chercher asile &#224; Londres. Le Conseil juge

souhaitable qu'il y ait s&#233;paration, au niveau de la politique, entre le probl&#232;me de l'admission et

de l'accueil des r&#233;fugi&#233;s aux Pays-Bas d'une part, et le soutien aux r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans

les pays en d&#233;veloppement d'autre part. Ne serait-ce qu'en raison des divergences d'optique en

mati&#232;re de d&#233;lai, il n'est pas dans l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t des r&#233;fugi&#233;s et des

demandeurs d'asile, ni dans celui de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de les lier sans plus

politiquement.

<p>

Le Conseil consid&#232;re que la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement a une t&#226;che en ce qui

concerne les projets de retour volontaire des r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans leur pays d'origine. Des efforts tant

bilat&#233;raux que multilat&#233;raux peuvent &ecirc;tre efficaces, certainement lorsqu'il s'agit de la

construction et de la reconstruction d'un pays. Il convient &#233;galement de promouvoir activement le

r&#233;tablissement des droits de l'homme tant politiques que socio-&#233;conomiques. Si l'on veut que le

rapatriement volontaire soit de nature durable, la situation du pays d'origine devra &ecirc;tre telle que les

int&#233;ress&#233;s ne soient pas une nouvelle fois oblig&#233;s de trouver leur salut ailleurs.

<p>

Au sein m&ecirc;me de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, il conviendrait d'accorder une plus

grande attention aux relations sociales dans une situation post-conflictuelle. Cela implique

concr&#232;tement qu'il faudrait oeuvrer davantage &#224; une r&#233;conciliation active entre les

groupes de population. On peut suivre en cela une politique internationale, qui prend forme tout doucement,

d'organisation de la paix par le d&#233;veloppement. Le Conseil estime &#233;galement souhaitable de

s'int&#233;resser de plus pr&#232;s au probl&#232;me des "r&#233;fugi&#233;s militants". Il s'agit de

millions de personnes qui vivent en exil depuis de nombreuses ann&#233;es au sein d'une

communaut&#233; de r&#233;fugi&#233;s dot&#233;e d'une structure politique et de sections

arm&#233;es, et qui m&#232;nent une guerre &#224; des fins politiques. Leur existence ne suscite pas

seulement des probl&#232;mes au niveau de la cr&#233;ation de fonds, mais elle provoque aussi des

dilemmes en droit international puisque le statut de r&#233;fugi&#233; d'une part et l'activisme politico-

militaire d'autre part ne sont pas compatibles.

<p>

Les r&#233;fugi&#233;s et leurs organisations en Occident devraient &ecirc;tre associ&#233;s

&#233;troitement aussi bien aux projets de retour au pays qu'aux processus de r&#233;conciliation. Leurs

connaissances, leur exp&#233;rience et leur engagement dans les projets de coop&#233;ration mis en

oeuvre dans leur patrie seraient doublement efficaces. D'une part, la fuite de cerveaux serait un peu moindre

dans le pays en d&#233;veloppement, puisque les personnes poss&#233;dant une bonne formation

pourraient jouer un r&ocirc;le dans la construction de leur pays et que, d'autre part, les donateurs

occidentaux pourraient profiter de l'expertise des r&#233;fugi&#233;s.

<p>

Selon le Conseil, des approches r&#233;gionales int&#233;gr&#233;es qui abordent les aspects politiques,

&#233;conomiques et de d&#233;veloppement de la question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s ou du retour au pays

m&#233;ritent d'&ecirc;tre soutenues. Ce type d'approche demande de la coordination en particulier entre

(et au sein de) l'ONU et la CE et entre les diff&#233;rentes organisations (d'aide) internationales, pour

harmoniser les diff&#233;rentes t&#226;ches. Le HCNUR tente d'&#233;tendre ses programmes et de

renforcer ses actions. Le Conseil estime qu'il importe de soutenir largement le HCNUR sur ce point comme

dans les activit&#233;s plus ou moins classiques, &#224; savoir: l'augmentation et l'am&#233;lioration de

l'aide d'urgence en coop&#233;ration avec d'autres organisations internationales, les donateurs nationaux et

les organisations non gouvernementales, l'accroissement des possibilit&#233;s du retour volontaire des

r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans le pays d'origine, entre autres par l'introduction de projets de

d&#233;veloppement &#224; r&#233;sultats rapides, le d&#233;placement des r&#233;fugi&#233;s dont la

vie ou la satisfaction des besoins fondamentaux sont menac&#233;s et l'am&#233;lioration de la protection

des r&#233;fugi&#233;s.

<b><li>Human Rights are Women's Right</b><br>
For millions of women the 1990's have meant terror, deprivation and the imperitive of fighting for justice.  Today what unites women internationally is their vulnerability to abuse of their fundamental human rights and their dedicated efforts to claim those rights.<p>

Most of the casualties of war are women and children; most of the world's refugees are children; most of the world's poor are women and children.  Human rights abuses against women remain rampant because they are largely hidden.<p>

This report launches Amnesty International's 1995 campaign for the protection of women's rights.  The report highlights the situation of women in some seventy five countries and shows how much work must be done if we are to have the United Nations' objective of 'equality by the year 2000".<br>

<b><li>Changing Women's Lives and Work</b><br>
<b>An analysis of the impacts of eight microenterprise projects</b><br>
<i>Lucy Creevey</i><br>
This book is an in-depth analysis of eight microenterprise projects - in India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Peru, Guatemala, Honduras, Ghana and Tanzania. It attempts to describe the effects the different projects had on women's lives and to look at their impacts from the point of view of the women themselves.<p>

The case studies are of projects undertaken by three agencies - ATI, specializing in the business approach; ITDG, specializing in the technological components of development; and UNIFEM, tending to use the community development approach. To the interest provided by such a comparison is added the opportunity of examining not only projects which attempted to achieve their aim through a single-aspect intervention (the 'unidimensional' projects) but also those which clustered several interventions (the 'multidimensional'). In general the multidimensional projects achieved greater impacts.<p>

The book is unique in its highly detailed presentation of such a varied range of individual projects, and in its use of a single analytical framework for all the projects, enabling comparisons to be tightly drawn between them. It is designed for planners and practitioners, graduate students, and others interested in the results of the microenterprise programmes now popular throughout the developing world. <br>

<b><li>Do It Herself<br>

Women and technical innovation</b><br>

<I>Edited by Helen Appleton</I><br>

Although women are the majority of small-scale technology users,

their technical knowledge and understanding has largely been

overlooked by organizations involved in technical assistance.

Against this background, this book investigates the contributions

of women to technical innovation at grassroots level, using 22

case studies of technical innovation by women in 16 countries in

Africa, Asia and Latin America. There has, until now, been

limited research on technology development and the impact of

technological change at a local level, and the information that

was available rarely addressed gender differences.<P>



The countries and regions described in this book have very

different histories, cultures, geography, and economic, social

and political environments, but certain themes emerge as central

to women's use, production and adaptation of technology. Women

are not generally high-profile users of technical hardware, but

have important technical skills and knowledge, and are engaged

in complex production processes. They constantly adapt and

innovate, or contribute to the adaptations and innovations of

others, but their expertise is unrecognized.<br>

<b><li>Genero y desarrollo: Nudos y desafios en el trabajo no gubernamental en el Ecuador<br>
(Gender and Development: Knots and Challenges in Non-governmental Work in Ecuador)</b><br>
<i>Lilia Rodriguez, 1993, 96 pages, ISBN 9978-82-157-0. Published by and available from CEPAM, Apartado Postal 17-15-0182-C, Quito, Ecuador.</i>
<br>
This book marks ten years of the Ecuador Centre for Women's Advancement and Action (CEPAM), an institution of which the author was a co-founder.  The author offers a "critical reflection borne out of personal experience and praxis in the non-governmental sector" in Ecuador (page 16).  In so doing, she critically examines the work of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in women related projects and inquires whether such projects "contribute to an elimination of women's subordination in society, while promoting women's development as individuals and a strengthening of their organizations" (page 15).<p>
 
Other issues considered include the extent to which women's projects are linked to national development strategies, and the future influence that women oriented institutions can have in shaping social policies and long-term development programmes.<p>

The book is organized into five chapters and an introduction.  The first chapter offers a brief overview of the recent evolution of Third World NGOs, with particular reference to gender issues (understood as the socially determined roles of men and women).  The second
chapter presents a short history of NGOs in Ecuador and a critical overview of women related projects in the context of changing national and international development strategies.  In Ecuador today, 33 out of a total of 323 NGOs claim that their beneficiaries are women. <p>

The third chapter confronts the issue of the effectiveness of NGOs in meeting gender needs, while chapter four uses the experience of CEPAM to explore the relationship between the state and NGOs.  A fifth chapter contains some conclusions.<p>

In contrast to its predecessors, Ecuador's social democracy Borja government (1988-1992) created the conditions for some participation by NGOs in the formulation of social
policies.  CEPAM was invited to advise the National Women's Directorate (DINAMU), an institution within the Ministry for Social Welfare in charge of policies, programmes and projects relating to women.  An extension of this was a joint project between CEPAM and the Ministry to establish the first shelter for battered women and children in the country, in official recognition of a widespread problem in Ecuadorian society. <p>

After a year of joint work, tensions and disagreements between the two institutions surfaced, a result of their different work styles and aspirations.  Shortly after CEPAM was put in charge of the project at the end of the second year, a new minister decided to withdraw all official support, which
prompted protests from parliamentarians, the media and the general public.  CEPAM was allowed to continue administering the shelter, but was left in charge also of finding funds to
resource it. <p>
 
This partnership experience leads the author to conclude that such arrangements are bound to generate difficulties that demand a change in attitude by both NGO staff and government officials.  It also revealed the importance of establishing alliances not simply within women's groups but also with other social actors, such as political parties, parliamentarians and the media.  Governments will generally engage in such partnerships
under certain political circumstances and, in order to take advantage of such openings, NGOs must not merely exhibit their competence, knowledge and professionalism in their chosen field, but must also demonstrate that they have systematically assessed and disseminated their
own experience.

The joint authors of this book come from very different backgrounds.  In their previous work, one had focused on the impacts of the capitalist world system on the people and nature of the South, the other had focused on the same processes but had considered the impacts on women.  In this book, they bring together their individual experiences and common concerns.  Within Ecofeminism they develop and discuss an alternative philosophy to that which has dominated Western thinking in recent centuries. <p>

 Through a common introduction and mainly individually authored chapters they explore three types of domination: by men over women, by North over South and by capitalist methods of production over nature.  Drawing on these perspectives and their knowledge of women's
resistance struggles, they consider a range of issues of concern to development, the environment and feminism.<p>

The authors argue against the dominant philosophical position articulated by thinkers commonly associated with the philosophical period of Enlightenment.  In discussing the concerns of grassroots women activists, the authors emphasize that their "...universalism does not deal in abstract universal human 'rights' but rather in common human needs which
can be satisfied only if the life-sustaining networks and processes are kept intact and alive" (page 13).<p>
  
The introduction includes a short history of ecofeminism and a discussion of different approaches to this philosophy.  The remaining 19 chapters are divided into six parts.  The first part focuses on the inadequacies of existing theories and ideologies.  The second, entitled "Subsistence v. Development", considers trends in and impacts of mainstream
development and environment strategies.  The third section focuses on some of the consequences of global trends, in particular, communities that have been displaced, changing perceptions of the state in India, and gender relations and modern consumerism. <p>

Biotechnology is the focus of part four with trade issues being considered in part five.  The sixth and final part, before the concluding chapter, is entitled "Subsistence: Freedom v. Liberalization" and includes three chapters on, respectively, consumer liberation, the decolonization of the North and population and reproduction issues.<br>

<b><li>Shelter, Women and Development - First and Third World Perspectives</b><br>
<i>Edited by Hemalata C. Dandekar </i><br>
This book is a collection of around 50 papers from a conference on shelter, women and development held at the University of Michigan in 1992.  Over the past five decades, the prevailing networks and customs that maintained women in traditional households have been transformed and disrupted.  However, changes to the position and status of women have not been reflected in changes to the legal, social and architectural approaches to housing.  <p>

This collection serves to emphasize the importance of housing in women's lives and their development, and the concerns about women's access and relationship to shelter.<p>
  
The papers are divided into nine sections, grouped according to specific themes.  Each section begins with an introductory overview chapter, followed by a number of papers on the specific theme.  The papers focus on the special concerns and issues that need to be addressed if enabling development oriented shelter is to be accessible to women and their
dependent children.  Case studies presented in some of the papers give examples of how access or lack of access to shelter has significant implications for the well-being and development of women. 
<p>
The themes are:
<ul><b>*</b>Shelter Policy: Implications for Women's Development<br>
<b>*</b>The Structure of Legal Interventions<br>
<b>*</b>Shelter and Women in Crisis<br>
<b>*</b>Women's Participation in the Production of Shelter<br>
<b>*</b>Shelter and Income Opportunities<br>
<b>*</b>Women and Shelter Related Services and Infrastructure<br>
<b>*</b>Non-traditional Living Arrangements: Beyond the Nuclear Family<br>
<b>*</b>Design and the Creation of Shelter for Women<br>
<b>*</b>Shelter Options for Elderly Women<br>
</ul><p>

The editor argues that there are six elements that re-occur throughout the various themes and papers and that are particularly detrimental to women.  These are: a gender-neutral approach to housing; the influence of the nuclear family and patriarchal traditions; the value of housing as a productive good; the effects of poverty; the need for appropriate
designs to satisfy women's needs; and the need to meet both practical and strategic development objectives through shelter.  She also argues that the papers reveal a compelling argument for paying special attention to women's needs for shelter and its relationship to development, and examines briefly the reasons why professionals and policy makers have
neglected this area.<br>

<b><li>Women in Micro and Small-Scale Enterprise Development</b><br>
<i>Edited by Louise Dignard and Jose Havet</i><br>


This book brings together contributions from both practitioners

and researchers in the field of women in micro- and small-scale

enterprises (WMSEs), in order to provide a detailed analysis of

current knowledge, and guidelines towards improved practice.  



Women's role in enterprise development is now acknowledged as

crucial, and a sense of urgency seems to beset all practitioners

in the field.  However, this eagerness in the sphere of practice

has not been matched by equal efforts in research, so there is

a danger that entrenched positions on good practice are adopted

without research evidence being available to support them. 

Policy prescriptions and programme implementations may therefore

be based on narrow and partial evidence.



The book presents the complexity of women's situations in WMSEs,

and the importance of the issues being addressed and will thus

be useful to all those working in the field of small enterprise

development.<br>

<B><li>Transforming Development<br>
Women, poverty and politics<BR></b>
<I>Margaret Snyder</i><BR>
The argument of this book, that women are central to development,
is presented through the story of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) - and of its projects in the field. It is a story which describes the reality of development within the context of the development system itself. The author, UNIFEM's founding Director, describes UNIFEM's beginnings: the search for structure, securing independent management, and riding the political and bureaucratic waves. Part II, `At work in the world', examines projects and activities that have been assisted worldwide, ranging from augmenting productivity at village level, to analysing the impact of the global market on women, and is a rare look at the longer-term effects of projects that have `come to an end'. These are women striving to be `agents of change, not creatures of circumstance'.<br><br><br>

<B><li>Women's Roles in Technical Innovation<br>
UNIFEM</b><BR>
Women's indigenous technical knowledge and innovative solutions to problems are in evidence across the whole range of food cycle activities. Unlike other books in this series which focus on specific food-related technical areas, this book highlights the broad scope of expertise that exists in rural areas.<BR>

 <b><li>Assessing the Gender Impact of Development Projects<br> 
Case studies from Bolivia, Burkina Faso and India</b><br>
 <i>Vera Gianotten, Verona Groverman, Edith van Walsum and Lida Zuidberg</i><br>
 Gender impact assessment is a way to estimate the expected impact of an intervention, such as a development project, on women; and to what extent the specific interests and needs of various categories of women will be affected. Such assessment provides information relevant to project planning, and should preferably take place before a project begins. This book presents three case studies from Burkina Faso, India and Bolivia in which this method was used, plus an introduction to the methodology, conclusions regarding its use, and the lessons to be learned from the studies.<br>

<h5>Le texte de cet avis et une liste des publications du  Conseil consultatif national pour la coop&#233;ration au

<b>Le 1er juillet 1993, le Conseil Consultatif National pour la Coop&#233;ration au

D&#233;veloppement (NAR) a pr&#233;sent&#233; &#224; M. Jan Pronk, ministre de la

Coop&#233;ration au D&#233;veloppement, une d&#233;claration sur la teneur et la

norme de la coop&#233;ration n&#233;erlandaise au d&#233;veloppement.</b>

<p>

<h3>R&#233;sum&#233;</h3>



Par cette d&#233;claration, le Conseil entend apporter une contribution au d&#233;bat

engag&#233; au sein de la soci&#233;t&#233; et du monde politique aux Pays-Bas sur la

coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Il pose &#224; cet effet:

<ul>

<li>qu'il convient de mettre fin le plus rapidement possible &#224; la confusion qui

r&#232;gne actuellement quant au contenu et &#224; la norme - dans cet ordre - de l'aide

n&#233;erlandaise;

<li>que la norme appliqu&#233;e jusque r&#233;cemment n'est absolument pas

excessive, eu &#233;gard aux probl&#232;mes, nouveaux ou connus, auxquels les pays en

d&#233;veloppement sont confront&#233;s;

<li>que les probl&#232;mes actuels des pays en d&#233;veloppement doivent &ecirc;tre

consid&#233;r&#233;s ou reconsid&#233;r&#233;s &#224; la lumi&#232;re des

d&#233;veloppements r&#233;cents;

<li>qu'une clarification de la politique n&#233;erlandaise s'impose, certainement si l'on

prend en compte le soutien que le Conseil a constat&#233; au sein de la population pour la

coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. 

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Clarifier la politique</h3>



Le Conseil pr&#233;conise qu'un certain nombre de mesures soient prises, dans un

d&#233;lai pr&#233;alablement fix&#233; de cinq ans, pour faire face aux

probl&#232;mes, nouveaux ou connus, qui se posent: aide accrue pour les pays en

d&#233;veloppement les plus pauvres, aide r&#233;duite pour les pays en

d&#233;veloppement plus riches, mesures en faveur de l'Europe centrale et orientale et

mesures en faveur de l'environnement. Une fois la nouvelle composition de l'aide

d&#233;finie, il convient de fixer, &#224; la fin de la p&#233;riode de cinq ans, le volume

de l'aide n&#233;erlandaise au niveau actuel, soit 1, 5  per cent du revenu national net (RNN).

<p>

Le Conseil plaide en faveur d'une conclusion rapide des n&#233;gociations commerciales

multilat&#233;rales dans le cadre de l'Uruguay Round, devant d&#233;boucher sur des

possibilit&#233;s accrues d'exportation pour les pays en d&#233;veloppement. Il entrevoit

par ailleurs la possibilit&#233; de parvenir &#224; des accords commerciaux au niveau

r&#233;gional entre le Nord et le Sud.

<p>

La protection des march&#233;s des pays riches contre les importations de biens en

provenance des pays en d&#233;veloppement et contre l'immigration de ressortissants de

ces pays en qu&ecirc;te de travail limite les possibilit&#233;s de d&#233;veloppement des

pays du Sud. Raison de plus pour apporter une aide &#224; ces pays de mani&#232;re

&#224; compenser les limitations qui leur sont ainsi impos&#233;es.

<p>

Le d&#233;bat sur les nouvelles t&#226;ches dans le domaine de l'environnement, de la

paix et de la s&#233;curit&#233; et sur l'aide 0ux pays d'Europe centrale et orientale ne

doit pas &ecirc;tre &#233;vit&#233;. Ces domaines pr&#233;sentent des points de

convergence avec la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement et peuvent donc &ecirc;tre

int&#233;gr&#233;s, sous certains conditions, &#224; la politique du d&#233;veloppement.



<p>

Par souci d'efficacit&#233; et afin de pr&#233;venir la dispersion de l'aide, le Conseil

entend limiter le nombre de pays - actuellement 54 - avec lesquels les Pays-Bas

entretiennent des relations de coop&#233;ration. Pour ce qui est de la r&#233;alisation des

objectifs de lutte structurelle contre la pauvret&#233;, l'accent doit &ecirc;tre mis sur les

37 pays les plus pauvres auxquels les Pays-Bas accordent actuellement une aide. L'extension

du programme d'aide aux pays d'Europe centrale et orientale n&#233;cessite

&#233;galement une r&#233;duction du nombre de pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiant de l'aide

des Pays-Bas.

<p>

<h3>Stopper le d&#233;tournement de l'aide &#224; des fins impropres</h3>



Le Conseil est optimiste quant au soutien de la population n&#233;erlandaise pour l'aide au

d&#233;veloppement. Il s'oppose au d&#233;tournement de l'aide &#224; des fins

impropres dans la politique n&#233;erlandaise, ainsi qu'&#224; la prise de d&#233;cisions

politiques non seulement confuses, mais encore contraires aux intentions et aux voeux d'une

grande partie de la population n&#233;erlandaise.

L'utilisation, en particulier depuis 1989, des cr&#233;dits de la coop&#233;ration au

d&#233;veloppement &#224; des fins impropres doit &ecirc;tre stopp&#233;e dans un

d&#233;lai pr&#233;alablement fix&#233; afin d'ouvrir la voie &#224; une politique

nouvelle.

<p>

<h3>Mesures &#224; prendre</h3>



Partant de la situation actuelle, le Conseil recommande au gouvernement de prendre dans

les cinq ann&#233;es &#224; venir les mesures suivantes :

<ul>

<li>Aide publique au d&#233;veloppement (APD): La premi&#232;re priorit&#233; doit

&ecirc;tre de porter cette aide,dont profitent les pays en d&#233;veloppement par le biais

de programmes multilat&#233;raux et bilat&#233;raux (y compris par l'interm&#233;diaire

des organisations de cofinancement) &#224; 1% du PNB (elle est actuellement de 0,78 %)

dans le budget pour 1998. Le tableau ci-dessous indique les objectifs &#224; fixer:

<p>

<li>Suppression des d&#233;penses impropres: Il convient de pr&#233;ciser clairement

les d&#233;penses qui doivent rester imput&#233;es au budget de la coop&#233;ration et

celles qui pourraient le devenir. Un certain nombre de d&#233;penses actuellement

imput&#233;es au budget du d&#233;veloppement doivent en &ecirc;tre exclues, en

particulier les frais d'accueil des demandeurs d'asile, la contribution vers&#233;e au

minist&#232;re de l'Enseignement et divers autres postes qui ne servent  en rien les

int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des pays en d&#233;veloppement. Les deux premiers postes (accueil

des demandeurs d'asile, contribution au minist&#232;re de l'Enseignement)

s'&#233;l&#232;vent dans le budget de 1993 &#224; 36 % de la totalit&#233; du budget

non-APD, soit 497,7 millions de florins sur un total de 1.385 millions. La totalit&#233; du

budget non-ADP repr&#233;sente 0,24 % du PNB ou 0,31 % du RNN. Cette mesure doit

intervenir dans un d&#233;lai fix&#233; &#224; l'avance (de 5 ans).



<li>S&#233;lection des pays: Il est imp&#233;ratif, pour des raisons d'efficacit&#233;,

de d&#233;finir de fa&#231;on plus rigoureuse le nombre de pays entrant en ligne de

compte pour une aide au d&#233;veloppement. Au moins 80 % des cr&#233;dits APD

pour l'aide bilat&#233;rale doivent &ecirc;tre mis &#224; la disposition de pays dont le

revenu par habitant &#233;tait inf&#233;rieur, en 1991, &#224; 650 $, les pays dont le

revenu par habitant (en 1991) &#233;tait sup&#233;rieur &#224; 1235 $ ne devant

b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'aucune aide au titre de l'APD. Les pays dont le revenu par

habitant se situe entre ces deux montants peuvent b&#233;n&#233;ficier, dans des

circonstances particuli&#232;res, de pr&ecirc;ts &#224; des conditions de faveur

r&#233;pondant aux crit&#232;res APD.



<li>Nouveaux pays: L'aide aux pays d'Europe centrale et orientale pourra

automatiquement &ecirc;tre imput&#233;e au budget APD lorsque ces pays

r&#233;pondront aux crit&#232;res de la liste CAD et pourvu que ce soit &#224; des

conditions de faveur suffisantes. Cette aide doit &ecirc;tre imput&#233;e au budget de

l'aide au d&#233;veloppement dans la mesure o&ugrave; les d&#233;penses impropres

seront supprim&#233;es; dans le cas contraire, il faudra voter des cr&#233;dits

suppl&#233;mentaires.



<li>D&#233;penses au titre de l'environnement: Les aides accord&#233;es par les Pays-

Bas aux pays de la liste du CAD par le biais de canaux bilat&#233;raux et

multilat&#233;raux (du Fonds pour l'Environnement Mondial, par exemple) et susceptibles

de leur permettre de satisfaire aux obligations des conventions internationales en

mati&#232;re d'environnement, seront automatiquement class&#233;es APD par le CAD.

Ces aides devront &ecirc;tre imput&#233;es au budget de l'aide au d&#233;veloppement

dans la mesure o&ugrave; les d&#233;penses impropres seront supprim&#233;es; dans le

cas contraire, il faudra voter des cr&#233;dits suppl&#233;mentaires.



<li>S&#233;paration des d&#233;penses: Un certain nombre de d&#233;penses

imput&#233;es au budget de la coop&#233;ration qui, bien qu'ayant un rapport avec les

pays en d&#233;veloppement ne sont pas class&#233;es dans la cat&#233;gorie APD par le

CAD, doivent &ecirc;tre plafonn&#233;es (d&#233;penses non-APD pour les frais

administratifs, certaines bonifications d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t, etc.). Ces d&#233;penses

doivent &ecirc;tre ramen&#233;es &#224; 0,14 % du PNB dans un d&#233;lai de cinq

ans.



<li>S&#233;curit&#233;: Les fonds destin&#233;s &#224; l'aide au

d&#233;veloppement ne doivent pas &ecirc;tre utilis&#233;s pour mettre un terme &#224;

des conflits; ils peuvent toutefois &ecirc;tre consacr&#233;s tant &#224; l'aide humanitaire

en cas de conflit qu'&#224; la reconstruction apr&#232;s un conflit. Pour &#233;valuer le

niveau des d&#233;penses militaires des pays en d&#233;veloppement et arr&ecirc;ter la

politique d'aide, il y a lieu de se conformer, dans la mesure du possible, aux crit&#232;res

communs propos&#233;s par l'ensemble des pays donateurs. L'aide au processus de mise

en place d'institutions d&#233;mocratiques, y compris au niveau local, en particulier

d'institutions visant &#224; promouvoir des proc&#233;dures fiables, doit &ecirc;tre

prioritaire.

</ul>

"Ce serait un miracle si nous r&#233;ussissions, avec notre fa&#231;on de fonctionner!"

d&#233;clarait Nehru en pr&#233;sentant le premier Plan quinquennal de l'Inde. Le

Conseil est convaincu que les probl&#232;mes internationaux en mati&#232;re de

s&#233;curit&#233;, de pauvret&#233; et d'environnement augmenteront en gravit&#233;

et en ampleur dans la d&#233;cennie &#224; venir et qu'ils exigeront des efforts et des

sacrifices plus grands de la part des pays industrialis&#233;s. En tant que partenaire dans la

coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement et d&#233;fenseur au niveau international des

int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des pays en d&#233;veloppement et de leurs populations, les Pays-Bas

doivent confirmer qu'ils fourniront une contribution appropri&#233;e et fiable &#224; la

solution de ces probl&#232;mes. Ils doivent m&ecirc;me, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant,

s'efforcer de relever la norme de l'aide, un objectif de 2 % du revenu national net

n'&#233;tant pas excessif.

Dutch aid has never been so donor-centric</h2>

<h4>by <i>Marit Scheepmakera</i>

<p>

Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly magazine on

development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol 29, No. 5, 1995: page

8</h4>

</center>

<hr>

<b>The "use" of development cooperation is discussed ever more

openly in the Netherlands. Aid doesn't help, or so claim the

sceptics, and they point primarily to Africa. No other continent

receives so much aid per head of population, and, at the same time,

in no other continent is the poverty so vast. But the Dutch

Government now wishes to take a different approach to development

cooperation - hopefully one which will prove to be more efficient.

A new exchange in which the recipient countries are to assume

greater responsibility.</b>

<p>

In recent years Dutch aid to African countries has fluctuated

between 1200 and 1300 million guilders. In 1996 a sum of 685

million guilders has been set aside for the regular cooperation

programmes with Egypt, Ethiopia, Yemen, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso,

Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda,

Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Thatþs 35 million guilders more

than in 1995 and 23 million more than was spent in 1994. With

adjustment to account for inflation, the total expenditure on

Africa is roughly the same as in 1990. In that year, at the first

meeting of the GCA in Maastricht, Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers

promised that Dutch aid to Africa would increase by 50% by the year

2000. Thus up to now little of what was promised has materialized.

Yet there would certainly appear to be every reason to increase the

aid. The current expectations are that by the year 2010 there will

be another 300 million chronically underfed people in Sub-Saharan

Africa. Yet in the explanatory statement accompanying the budget

for 1996 it appears that the Dutch Government is now thinking more

in terms of a different - and hopefully more effective - approach

to aid.

<p>

The same applies to Africa as to the other developing countries

with which the Netherlands cooperates: less aid in the form of

projects and more in terms of budget support, programme aid and

sector aid.

<p>

"It has too often been the case in the past that our policy

objectives differed from those of the African Governments," says

Bernard Berendsen, Head of the Africa Directorate at the

development deopartment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS).

"It appears that many projects fail because they do not mesh with

the policy of a country. As a result, as soon as the donor's back

is turned, the results of the project disappear like snow in the

sun. The inevitable conclusion is that we have to renounce

involvement in a project if the policy conditions are

unfavourable."

<p>

The DGIS is working to integrate development aid within the

national or regional policy of the various African countries. For

example, by contributing "x" million guilders to the education

budget of a country, the DGIS also hopes to be able to exert a

certain amount of influence on the policy as a whole. "The aim is

that the money should find its way to those actively implementing

the programme by means of the shortest route. Thus less money is

sidetracked into all sorts of intermediary organizations and

bodies."

<p>

But what if the organization of the government in question is weak,

corrupt or very centralized? Amongst other things, the latest

explanatory statement to the budget refers to the corruption in

Kenya and Tanzania as being a serious problem. Are such countries

really ideal partners for cooperation?

<p>

Berendsen: "In such cases we will have to keep a strict watch on

expenditure and accountability. There will be a certain amount of

paternalism." He points to the fact that development aid

contributes to a reduction of precisely this kind of corruption and

simultaneously encourages good governance. This can be achieved,

for example, by a reorganization of the mechanism of government

combined with increased salaries for officials. Civil servants are

often forced to take on all sorts of additional employment or to

ask for extra money for services rendered in order to survive.

Another way in which the state mechanism can be strengthened is by

improving the system of taxation in a country.

<p>

Paul Hoebink, who is attached to the Third World Centre of the

Catholic University in Nijmegen is highly sceptical about the new

policy plans. "The Dutch aid to Africa is progressively of symbolic

value. If the Netherlands wishes to exert some kind of influence it

needs to concentrate on a number of countries. This is something we

could do in consultation with the Scandinavian countries and

Germany. If the Netherlands were to "adopt" six or seven African

countries, that would be sufficient. At the moment the development

aid is parcelled out over 56 countries. Minister Pronk is

attempting to use the aid as a crowbar, as a means of exerting

political influence. But the amounts of aid involved are too small

to serve such a purpose. For this reason I don't expect to see the

number of projects being reduced. Small amounts are easily spent on

projects. Hoebink is a member of the National Advisory Council for

Development Cooperation, which came forward earlier this year with

a similar recommendation. He points to the fact that not all

countries encounter problems in managing a large number of projects

- an argument that is often used against support in the form of

projects. "Mali, for example, manages projects very well."

<p>

Pieter Marres, director of training and education at the Royal

Institute for the Tropics, considers that the Netherlands does not

have a genuinely political Africa policy. "It is development

cooperation policy," believes the former head of the West Africa

division of the DGIS. "What you see is the political dimension

gradually being introduced into development cooperation. The issues

concerned being human rights, the position of women, the

environment, democratization and good governance. This has led to

a situation in which Dutch development projects are now assessed on

the basis of a multitude of criteria. The objectives of the Dutch

policy are very worthy objectives, but it is difficult to translate

them into separate projects. Aid has never been so "donor-centric",

by which I do not mean that the aid is primarily intended to

benefit the Dutch business community. The proportion of the aid

going to the business community is only 20 to 30%. It is more so

the case that the aid carries the ideological objectives of the

donor. Instead of this, the Dutch Government would be far better

off considering which of its objectives it wishes to realize in

bilateral consultation with a particular African country

independent of the aid being given. The policy discussion - also in

relation with the developing countries - needs to be carried out at

a high political level. And this is actually the task of the Dutch

Minister of Foreign Affairs. Relations with Mali are not

essentially any different from relations with France." That

Minister Jan Pronk might function in practice as a kind of Minister

of Foreign Affairs for Africa is wrong as far as Marres is

concerned. "I find it wrong on principle. Development cooperation

is one of the instruments of foreign policy. Issues such as

democratization, good governance, peace missions and the

environment do not solely concern the developing countries, and, as

such, these issues are the responsibility of the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs."

<p>

Marres welcomes the intention to finance fewer projects with

development money and to extend more programme, sector and general

aid, such as budget support. "I need to see it, before I believe

it. Pronk has a tendency to get very involved in the details when

it comes to the spending of development money. The officials will

also be less enamoured of this new form of aid since it means that

they will be less involved. The implementation will have to be done

far more in the countries themselves. And they will claim that a

great deal will go wrong if they are not involved. And naturally

there is less to be gained by the Netherlands if you say to a

developing country: "You organize it and we will pay."

<p>

He agrees with Pronk that there are good reasons to reduced aid in

the form of projects. "It was an unfortunate choice of aid, since

such a multitude of projects is an enormous burden for the

administrative organization of the African countries." Besides, the

disappointing results of twenty, thirty years of development aid

are sufficient reason in themselves to introduce a different

approach. "If you see how bad education and healthcare are in rural

Africa. That after so many years there is just one book for a whole

class of school children. That in clinics there is absolutely

nothing but three aspirins past their shelf life. Itþs certainly

cause for thought."

<p>

Marres is of the opinion that the DGIS should probably concentrate

all its efforts on macro support. "Why not leave the financing of

projects entirely to the co-financing organizations in the

Netherlands, the business community, trade unions, institutes and

similar organizations? The ministry can restrict itself to a global

policy assessment. In addition to this, the enlisting of local NGOs

is of great importance. The embassies could play an important role

in the selection of the NGOs, sorting out the wheat from the chaff,

investigating which of the local NGOs really meet a need and are

supported. There is so much expertise in the embassies, easily

twenty to twenty-five years experience in the field of development

cooperation. They could do with some work.

<p>

In this set up, the DGIS would have to take on the role of

inspection and evaluation. "And I would appoint some extremely

annoying people to take part in the delegations."

Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek Inzake Ontwikkelingssamenwerking<P> door<I> Kristien Verbrugghen</I>

<h4>Tekst van een artikel verschenen in <I>Universiteit & Beleid</I>, vol. 9, no. 4, 1995: pp. 44-49

<p></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

<B>In uitvoering van de op 26 september 1994 door de VL.I.R. en Staatssecretaris voor 

Ontwikkelingssamenwerking E. DERYCKE afgesloten overeenkomst m.b.t. beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking (BVO), organiseerde de VL.I.R. in het voorjaar van 1995 de selectie van projecten voor BVO 1995. In dit artikel wordt uiteengezet hoe de selectie werd georganiseerd en wat het resultaat hiervan is. Dit artikel blikt tenslotte vooruit op 1996, het jaar waarin de Vlaamse universiteiten hun beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO vorm willen geven. 

<P>

De procedure voor de selectie van projecten voor BVO 1995 bestond achtereenvolgens uit het bepalen van drie algemene en drie punctuele thema's, het lanceren van de oproep tot de Vlaamse universiteiten tot het indienen van voorstellen, het evalueren van de 16 ingediende projectvoorstellen door de bevoegde VL.I.R.-deskundigencommissie, het formuleren van het definitief VL.I.R.-advies, het bespreken van het VL.I.R.-advies door de Stuurgroep en de definitieve selectie van 8 projecten door de Staatssecretaris.

</B>

<P>

<H4>1. BELEIDSVOORBEREIDEND ONDERZOEK INZAKE ONTWIKKELINGSSAMENWERKING 1995</H4>

<P>

<H4>Concept van beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek</H4>

<P>

Op 26 september 1994 werd door de VL.I.R. een overeenkomst ondertekend met Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking E. DERYCKE m.b.t. de organisatie van het beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek en de advisering op het vlak van ontwikkelingssamenwerking (BVO). Deze Overeenkomst regelt de bijdrage van de VL.I.R. tot de organisatie en uitvoering van wetenschappelijk onderzoek en studies die worden opgezet met het oog op de ondersteuning van het overheidsbeleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Het doel is enerzijds het versterken van de analytische capaciteiten van het ABOS, en anderzijds het cre&#235;ren binnen de universiteiten van kennis over de ontwikkelingsproblematiek waarop het beleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking een beroep kan doen. 

<P>

<H4>Bepaling van de thema's voor BVO 1995</H4>

<P>

Artikel 6 van bovenvermelde Overeenkomst stipuleert dat de Staatssecretaris, bij het begin van elk jaar, op voorstel van het ABOS en na raadpleging van de Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek" - die is samengesteld uit vertegenwoordigers van het Kabinet, het ABOS en de universiteiten -, de thema's voor BVO vastlegt. De IODEWE - Interuniversitaire Overlegstructuur Derde Wereld - richtte op vraag van de Stuurgroep op 22 december 1994 een schrijven tot alle Rectoren en tot alle leden van de IODEWE met de vraag voorstellen voor thema's voor BVO 1995 in te dienen v&#243;&#243;r 16 januari 1995. Deze universitaire voorstellen werden, tezamen met de ABOS-voorstellen, door de Stuurgroep op 24 januari 1995 besproken, op basis waarvan de Stuurgroep een advies aan de Staatssecretaris formuleerde. 

<P>

In navolging van de eerder door de Stuurgroep genomen beslissing om het aantal thema's enerzijds te beperken en anderzijds aan te houden gedurende twee &#224; drie jaar, met het oog op het vergroten van de continuteit in het onderzoek en op een mogelijke taakverdeling tussen de Vlaamse universiteiten, werden drie algemene thema's geselecteerd : politiek-juridische dimensie van het ontwikkelingsstreven, armoedebestrijding en macro-economische dimensie van ontwikkeling. Daarnaast werden nog drie thema's bepaald voor kortlopend, punctueel onderzoek : wegtransport versus spoorwegvervoer in Afrika, universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking : een strategisch onderzoek, en twinning arrangements als vorm van ondersteuning van het onderwijs in derde-wereldlanden. Dit advies van de Stuurgroep werd door het ABOS aan de Staatssecretaris overgemaakt. Op 20 februari 1995 ontving de VL.I.R. van de Staatssecretaris de definitieve lijst met thema's voor BVO 1995. Deze lijst verschilde op &#233;&#233;n punt van het advies van de Stuurgroep : het thema "ecologie en duurzame ontwikkeling" dat aanvankelijk door de Stuurgroep, op aandringen van het ABOS, was afgevoerd, was nu t&#243;ch opgenomen als thema voor punctueel onderzoek.

<P>

<H4>Budget BVO 1995</H4>

<P>

De globale toelage voor BVO 1995 bedraagt minstens 15 miljoen BF. Hiervan is 1 miljoen BF bestemd als tussenkomst van het ABOS in de door de VL.I.R. gemaakte kosten naar aanleiding van de administratieve ondersteuning van het BVO. In maart 1995 werd door Staatssecretaris E. DERYCKE voorgesteld om van het bijkomend krediet van 100 mio BF toegekend aan universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking, 1 mio BF toe te voegen aan het budget voor BVO 1995. Hiervan zal 500 000 BF bestemd zijn voor punctueel advies b&#250;iten de BVO-thema's. Deze bijkomende uitgave moet echter nog door het nieuwe Parlement worden goedgekeurd. De Stuurgroep besliste bovendien reeds tijdens haar eerste vergadering op 20 december 1994 om, ter bekrachtiging van een eerder door de Staatssecretaris genomen beslissing, het lopend onderzoeksproject "Early warning systems" van Prof. R. DOOM (RUG) te verlengen op de kredieten voor BVO 1995, a rato van 825 000 BF. Het te verdelen budget voor BVO 1995 bedraagt derhalve minstens 13 175 000 BF, wellicht 13 675 000 BF. Ongeveer 80 % van dit budget is bestemd voor de financiering van onderzoeksprojecten kaderend in &#233;&#233;n van de algemene thema's; 20 % is voorbehouden voor onderzoek kaderend in &#233;&#233;n van de punctuele thema's. 

<P>

<H4>Vraag naar universitaire projectvoorstellen voor BVO 1995</H4>

<P>

Op 21 februari 1995 werden de Vlaamse universiteiten uitgenodigd om onderzoeksvoorstellen voor BVO 1995 bij de VL.I.R. in te dienen, uiterlijk op 3 april 1995. Onderzoeksvoorstellen dienden zoveel mogelijk te kaderen of in &#233;&#233;n van de algemene thema's of in &#233;&#233;n van de thema's voor punctueel onderzoek voor BVO 1995. Het stond de universiteiten echter ook vrij voorstellen in te dienen buiten de BVO-thema's; de kans dat deze voorstellen voor financiering zouden worden geselecteerd, was echter aanzienlijk veel kleiner dan voor de thema's die door de Staatssecretaris werden vooropgesteld. Zowel de VL.I.R. als de Staatssecretaris moedigden de Vlaamse universiteiten aan interuniversitaire projecten in te dienen. 

<P>

<H4>Prioriteitsrangschikking van de ingediende projectvoorstellen</H4>

<P>

Op 20 april 1995 werden de 16 ingediende projectvoorstellen voorgelegd aan de VL.I.R.-deskundigencommissie "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek", die werd samengesteld uit leden uit de VL.I.R.-deskundigencommissies "Humane wetenschappen" en "Economische en toegepaste economische wetenschappen", de VL.I.R.-Werkgroep "Ontwikkelingssamenwerking" en de voormalige VL.I.R.-Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek". Aan de commissie werd gevraagd een prioriteitsrangschikking van de projectvoorstellen op te maken. Hiertoe heeft de commissie ondermeer gesprekken gevoerd met de promotoren van de projectvoorstellen. Hierbij dient aangestipt dat het in de bedoeling lag van het VL.I.R.-secretariaat om, op basis van de beoordeling van individuele projectvoorstellen en met het oog op het uitbouwen van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming en interuniversitaire samenwerking, over te gaan tot het vormen van interuniversitaire projectgroepen. De commissie is het secretariaat hierin gevolgd voor wat het thema van armoedebestrijding betreft : het is een verdienste te noemen dat daags na de commissievergadering de promotoren van de drie weerhouden projecten rond het thema van armoedebestrijding zich principieel akkoord hebben verklaard tot het beter afstemmen op mekaar van elk van de drie projecten. Hiertoe werd door de promotoren een intentieverklaring opgesteld. Voor wat de overige thema's betreft, heeft de commissie de individuele projecten beoordeeld en naar prioriteit gerangschikt, zonder in dit stadium interuniversitaire samenwerking expliciet in de projecten in te bouwen. De commissie ging er echter wel mee akkoord dat in het licht van de voorbereiding van BVO 1996 zou worden nagedacht over hoe de indienings- en selectieprocedures zouden kunnen worden aangepast met het oog op het uitstippelen van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming en interuniversitaire samenwerking. De VL.I.R. verklaarde zich op 4 mei 1995 akkoord met de door de deskundigencommissie opgestelde prioriteitsrangschikking.

<P>

Op 9 mei 1995 kwam de Stuurgroep opnieuw samen om, op basis van het VL.I.R.-advies, een gezamenlijk advies aan de Staatssecretaris te formuleren m.b.t. te financieren onderzoeksvoorstellen. Het VL.I.R.-advies werd op alle punten gevolgd, met uitzondering van het volgende : er werd beslist het project rond sociale clausules van Prof. D. VAN DEN BULCKE (RUCA) te verdagen naar de volgende indieningsronde omdat de vraag tot verlenging voorbarig was - het BVO 1994-project rond sociale clausules werd pas op 1 februari 1995 opgestart -, omdat de Stuurgroep de resultaten van het lopend onderzoek wou afwachten, en omdat de beleidsrelevantie voor het ABOS niet echt duidelijk was. Voorts werd beslist het interuniversitair project over universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking dat door de VL.I.R. zelf werd ingediend, w&#233;l op te nemen in de lijst van te financieren projecten, zonder het echter in de prioriteitsrangschikking op te nemen. Het project kreeg het label "buiten categorie". De Stuurgroep was het immers eens over de noodzaak om een moment van evaluatie in te bouwen in de huidige praktijk van universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking, gelet op de nieuwe Overeenkomst m.b.t. universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking die de Vlaamse universiteiten op het punt stonden af te sluiten met de Staatssecretaris. Het is echter wel de bedoeling dat tussen het VL.I.R.-project en het project van Prof. R. DEVISCH, dat dezelfde thematiek behandelt, een nauwe samenwerking en informatie-uitwisseling wordt gerealiseerd. Het advies van de Stuurgroep werd door het ABOS aan de Staatssecretaris overgemaakt.

<P>

<H4>Definitieve selectie van BVO 1995-projecten</H4>

<P>

Op 2 juni 1995 ontving de VL.I.R. het officieel schrijven van Staatssecretaris E. DERYCKE m.b.t. de definitieve selectie van onderzoeksprojecten voor BVO 1995. Met zijn selectie komt de Staatssecretaris tegemoet aan het advies dat de Stuurgroep hieromtrent had geformuleerd. De projecten zullen vermoedelijk in het najaar van 1995 worden opgestart.

<H4>2. BELEIDSVOORBEREIDEND ONDERZOEK INZAKE ONTWIKKELINGSSAMENWERKING 1996 : VOORBEREIDING VAN HET TE VOEREN BELEID VAN ZWAARTEPUNTVORMING

</H4>

<P>

<B>De VL.I.R. beoogt om in het kader van BVO 1996 een gedegen, interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te concipi&#235;ren en te voeren, en hiermee de toon te zetten voor de komende jaren. Hiervoor rekent de VL.I.R. op de constructieve inbreng van de Vlaamse universiteiten, die recent werden verzocht hun concrete voorstellen voor thema's waarrond continu zwaartepuntonderzoek dient te worden uitgebouwd, aan de VL.I.R. over te maken.

</B>

<P>

<H4>Situering</H4>

<P>

De VL.I.R. heeft van bij het opstarten van het beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek de noodzaak beklemtoond van het uitstippelen door de Vlaamse universiteiten van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO. De visie van de VL.I.R. op onderzoek dat gericht is op de voorbereiding van het overheidsbeleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking kan alsvolgt worden samengevat:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>met dit onderzoek moet ingespeeld kunnen worden op beleidsvragen van de overheid;



<LI>teneinde op de vragen van de overheid te kunnen inspelen, moet het BVO dat aan de universiteiten wordt uitgevoerd, versterkt worden;

<LI>dit onderzoek moet van internationaal niveau zijn, i.e. van dermate kwaliteit dat het internationaal meespeelt. Dit veronderstelt zwaartepuntvorming  aansluitend bij bestaand onderzoek en de eigen inspanningen van de universiteiten waarbij dit zwaartepuntonderzoek moet kunnen rekenen op voldoende sterke en continue financile ondersteuning. Een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming sluit echter geenszins vernieuwing uit;

<LI>het BVO vormt op Vlaams niveau best een geco&#246;rdineerd geheel, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met het zwaartepuntonderzoek in Franstalig Belgi&#235; en internationaal. Vanzelfsprekend wordt interuniversitaire samenwerking rond zwaartepunten aanbevolen;

<LI>het BVO moet tevens de belangstelling voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking in de universiteiten z&#233;lf levendig houden. Daarom dient het best te berusten op onderzoekskernen in verschillende universiteiten.

</UL>

<P>

Dat het de VL.I.R. ernst is wanneer aangedrongen wordt op geco&#246;rdineerde zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO, blijkt uit het op 16 juni 1995 door de VL.I.R. aan de Staatssecretaris voorgestelde meerjarenprogramma voor indirecte universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Een dergelijk meerjarenprogramma wordt vereist door de nieuwe Overeenkomst inzake universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking die onlangs tussen de VL.I.R. en de Staatssecretaris werd afgesloten. In dit meerjarenprogramma wordt voorzien dat het BVO-budget geleidelijk zou toenemen van 16 mio BF in 1995 tot 35 mio BF in 2000, op voorwaarde echter dat hier tegenover een duidelijk geconcipieerd interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming rond een beperkt aantal thema's staat.

<P>

<H4>Themata</H4>

<P>

De Vlaamse universiteiten moeten zich derhalve beraden over het antwoord op de vraag rond welke thematieken zij continu zwaartepuntonderzoek in het BVO wensen uit te bouwen. Het antwoord op deze vraag hangt enerzijds samen met het Vlaams, universitair potentieel inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking, i.e. er dient te worden nagegaan wie op dit ogenblik bezig is met ontwikkelingsrelevant onderzoek rond welke problematiek. Anderzijds hangt het antwoord samen met het beleid dat de Vlaamse universiteiten m.b.t. het BVO willen voeren en de eigen inspanningen die zij ervoor willen leveren. Bij het bepalen van de zwaartepunten dient voorts ook rekening te worden gehouden met het zwaartepuntonderzoek dat elders rond ontwikkelingssamenwerking wordt bedreven, ondermeer door de Franstalige universiteiten, alsook met de internationale agenda's en de actualiteit.

<P>

In de loop van de maand september 1995 zal de Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek" de voorbereidingen voor het BVO 1996 opstarten. Dit omvat in de eerste plaats het bepalen van de prioritaire thema's waarrond onderzoek zal worden uitgevoerd. 

<P>

De Stuurgroep heeft in december 1994 beslist om, vanaf BVO 1995, jaarlijks slechts een beperkt aantal algemene thema's te selecteren, die gedurende een eerste periode van 2 &#224; 3 jaar zouden worden behouden. Voor dit beperkt aantal algemene thema's zou &#177; 80 % van het beschikbare BVO-budget worden uitgetrokken; deresterende 20 % van het budget zou worden voorbehouden voor 1 of 2 punctuele thema's voor kortlopend onderzoek, die wel veranderlijk zouden zijn per jaar. Hierbij dient gewezen op het onderscheid tussen algemene en punctuele thema's. Algemene thema's zijn thema's die gedurende meerdere jaren worden aangehouden en die doorgaans vrij breed zullen worden gedefinieerd zodanig dat de mogelijkheid bestaat om op gezette tijden andere deelaspecten van eenzelfde problematiek te bestuderen. Punctuele thema's zijn thema's die jaarlijks zullen wijzigen. In het kader hiervan zal enerzijds kortlopend onderzoek worden verricht naar actuele en zeer specifieke problemen. Anderzijds zal via dit kanaal kortlopend onderzoek worden verricht om de relevantie van een bepaalde problematiek aan te kaarten, wat impliceert dat de mogelijkheid bestaat dat punctuele thema's kunnen uitgroeien tot zwaartepunten. Het onderzoek dat wordt verricht rond punctuele en algemene thema's is gericht resp. op beleidsconceptie en op beleidsvoorbereiding en -implementatie. De beslissing om het BVO aldus te organiseren, was een eerste aanzet tot het uitstippelen en voeren van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO.

<P>

Het ligt in de bedoeling van de VL.I.R. om in het kader van BVO 1996 een gedegen, interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te concipi&#235;&#235;ren en te voeren, en hiermee de toon te zetten voor de komende jaren. Hiervoor rekent de VL.I.R. op de constructieve inbreng van de Vlaamse universiteiten. Op 17 juli 1995 werden de Vlaamse universiteiten derhalve door de VL.I.R. uitgenodigd tot het formuleren van voorstellen voor prioritaire thema's voor BVO 1996, zowel voor algemene als voor punctuele thema's, uiterlijk op 11 september 1995. Deze voorstellen zullen door de VL.I.R. als input worden gebruikt om een interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te ontwerpen. 

<P>

Tenslotte dient vermeld dat de Stuurgroep, bij het formuleren van haar advies m.b.t. de thema's voor BVO 1996, de drie algemene thema's voor BVO 1995 - "politiek-juridische dimensie van het ontwikkelingsstreven", "armoedebestrijding", en "macro-economische dimensie van ontwikkeling" - weliswaar indien mogelijk zal trachten te behouden, maar deze toch slechts eerder als voorlopige opties zal beschouwen, gelet op het feit dat deze drie thema's met een minimum aan universitaire inbreng en in een zeer kort tijdsbestek werden bepaald.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Opposition press, politicians under fire in Albania </TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="ffffff" text="#000000" link="#9c181c" vlink="#9c181c"><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="../info.html">Index on Censorship  </a></i><hr><h2>Opposition press, politicians under fire in Albania</h2> <i>by Laura Bruni</i><p>Assault charges against journalist Altin Hazizaj were dropped on 2 February, following international protests against his detention. Hazizaj, who works for <i>Koha Jone</i> one of Albania's most prominent and outspoken papers, had been arrested while covering a violent conflict between police and demonstrators two days earlier. The paper said the case was 'the culmination of a campaign of intimidation', which included the seizure by police of <i>Koha Jone</i>'s six distribution vehicles the week before.<p>Albania's opposition papers have become used to harassment and claim that the independent press functions despite the prevailing political culture not because of it. The latter part of 1995 was a difficult time for those out of favour with the government and the outlook for this year, with general elections due in the spring, looks even bleaker. <p>The main opposition parties, the Socialists and the Democratic Alliance, claim that Albanians now enjoy fewer freedoms than in 1992, when the current government of Dr Sali Berisha was elected. They point to three recent pieces of repressive legislation. One of them, the Verification Law, empowers a state committee to decide whether people may hold public office on the evidence of files maintained by the Sigurimi (the former Communist secret police), a vetting procedure which extends to journalists in the state media and in large-circulation newspapers, whether state-owned or not.<p>The Genocide and Communist Crime Law, furthermore, bars prominent ex-Communists from public office until 2002 and is so vaguely worded that it can be applied selectively to prevent many prominent opposition politicians seeking re-election this year - even those who served only very briefly in the reformed Communist regime of Ramiz Alia. Interestingly, the law makes a specific exception for those ex-Communists who acted against the official line and publicly distanced themselves from the Communist regime. This allows President Berisha, Enver Hohxa's personal doctor and a former Albanian Workers' Party functionary who resigned from the Party in 1990, to remain in office and run for President again. When the Constitutional Court rejected as 'groundless' appeals lodged against both laws, opposition leaders accused the government of creating a dictatorship to deal with the consequences of a previous dictatorship. Both laws have come under fire from rights organisations such as Article 19 and Human Rights Watch.<p>A further blow for the opposition was the passage in early February of the new Electoral Law which threatens to squeeze out small parties by preventing groups from joining together to break the four per cent barrier needed to secure parliamentary representation. Changes in the procedure for counting votes and the system for allotting campaign airtime on television both reportedly favour the ruling Democratic Party. The broadcast media are still under strict state control and state television currently grants little coverage to opposition views. On 23 January the Socialist Party accused Albanian TV of censorship after important parts of an interview with the Party's general secretary, Gramoz Ruci, in which he talked about the country's social and economic problems, were cut. It seems unlikely that proposals to allow the establishment of private broadcast media will be implemented in time to redress the balance of electoral coverage in favour of opposition parties.<p>Laws regulating the press have also come under serious criticism, most recently in a December1995 report by Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights entitled <i>Press Restrictions in Albania</i>. The report criticises the Press Law and Penal Code on several fronts, not least because they are so broadly drawn that they effectively criminalise legitimate criticism and investigative journalism without providing any constititional protection for freedom of expression. The authorities have not held back in using the law to attack opposition critics and prosecutions appear to be heavily influenced by the government and ruling party to the extent that only opposition and independent journalists have been prosecuted. The situation has been made worse by attempts to assert economic control over the press through the imposition of prohibitive taxes and complex financial regulations.<p>Politics in Albania have degenerated into a series of battles between personalities and power groups and is becoming increasingly violent. Gjergj Zefi, a leading Democratic Alliance politician received head injuries after a severe beating by a gang in the town of Shkoder in early January. <i>Aleanca</i>, the Democratic Alliance newspaper, suspects that the attack may be an attempt by organised crime to intimidate the local government opposition. Meanwhile some 45 judges have been granted police protection after bomb attacks on the homes of two chief justices in Kukes and Tirana. <p>Albania's leading writer Ismael Kadare, interviewed in 1995, characterised the current political mood as aggressive, cruel and stubborn. He argues that the opposition bear some responsibility for creating a culture of hatred, passion and personal vendettas. If Kadare is right, it is to be feared that, whichever party forms the next government, it will be some time before Albania can progress towards genuine political stability. <hr></BODY></HTML>

Italian aid? No grazie! We'd rather have nothing at all</h2>

<h4>by <i>Jan van der Putten</i>

<p>

Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly magazine on

development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol 29, No. 5, 1995: page

9</h4>

</center>

<hr>

<b>Italy's African policy was based on blind self-interest. It

mainly took the form of colossal corruption and the financing of

local despots. Fortunately - both for Italy and for Africa - the

policy collapsed. There is now the wait for a new era.</b>

<p>

Long before they were allies in the Second World War, Germany and

Italy were already in the same camp: the camp of the colonial

losers. In both countries national unity was late to arrive. At

that stage the choice colonial morsels had long been shared out.

But Italy spotted the Horn of Africa, and with that, in 1889

Italian colonialism was born.

<p>

More than a hundred years later, Italy's colonial legacy is proving

a terrible embarrassment. For if the former Italian colonies are

today the scene of chaos and bloodshed, this is in no small measure

thanks to the former mother country. Italy chose to pursue a policy

in which its own self-interest took the form of colossal corruption

and the financing of local despots. Now that the true nature of the

policy has been revealed nothing more remains. If Italy still

harbours certain intentions where Africa is concerned it is solely

thanks to the efforts of private and clerical organizations.

<p>

In 1905 the Italian protectorate of Somalia was granted colonial

status. The dictator Mussolini, who was so desperately determined

to turn Italy into a great Power, embarked on a campaign of

conquest. In the war against Ethiopia (1935-1936) bombers were

used. After the Italian victory there emerged an Italian East

Africa consisting of the colonies of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.

The monumental work by the historian Angelo del Boca on Italian

colonialism completely destroys the myth of the relatively decent

comportment of the Italians in the Horn of Africa.

<p>

Before Italy had lost the Second World War, Italy had already lost

its colonies - but not its influence. In 1950 it was commanded by

the UN to guide Somalia towards emancipation. Ten years later the

country became independent. At that time it was not scourged by

armed bands and there were no starving children roaming the streets

of Mogadishu. No one could then have suspected that a civil war

would raise the country to the ground. Italy contributed powerfully

to the outbreak of the war with its support of the dictatorship of

Siad Barre, regardless of whether it was described as development

aid or went by some other name. This support stimulated the

rebellion of the clans which had no access to the Italian wealth.

<p>

Has Italy ever pursued an African policy worthy of the name? Of

course good relations were entered into with Algeria and Libya

since the neighbouring countries were important oil suppliers. This

was the reason that Italy was pro-Arab. This worked out well for

the great American ally, it meant that pro-Israeli Washington had

a link to the Arab world. Apart from that, after a brief period of

idealism, there was no policy at all, except that of profit.

Initiatives announced with a great deal of fanfare, such as the

formation of a cooperative of all of the countries around the

Mediterranean turned out to be nothing more than hot air.

<p>

Under the Ministers of Foreign Affairs Giulio Andreotti (Christian

Democrat, 1983-1989) and Gianni de Michelis (Socialist, 1989-1992)

Africa became a neo-colonial extension of national politics. Just

as the entire Italian society was divided up into party political

provinces, so Africa was carved up along party political lines.

Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya and Za&iuml;re were allocated to the Christian

Democrats, while Somalia, Algeria and Tunisia became the hunting

grounds of the Socialists. Morocco, Kenya, the Sudan and Senegal

were fraternally shared by the Christian Democrats and the

Socialists and, appropriately enough, the (ex-) communists of the

opposition were allocated their share of the booty in the form of

the Marxist countries of Angola and Mozambique.

<p>

The implications of this division? An entrepreneur wishing to do

business with Ethiopia first had to hand over a percentage to the

Christian Democrat Party. A development project in Somalia? The

palms of the socialists first needed to be greased. An Italian

hospital for Angola? Permission first had to be purchased from the

communist executives in Rome. The remainder of the developing world

was divided up along the same lines. But Italy focused most of its

attention on Africa, and within Africa on the former colonies. From

1979 to 1992 Italy set aside 42 trillion Lire for development aid.

Calculated at the current very much devaluated exchange rate that

still amounts to 42 billion guilders. The government proudly

announced that no other country in the world was doing as much in

terms of development aid as Italy. That was in the time that De

Michelis declared that Italy had become the fourth great world

power. The majority of the development money was intended for the

former colonies of Somalia and Ethiopia. Development of some sort

may well have taken place, but it had little to do with the

population. In the period from 1980 to 1987, the years of the most

intense Italian aid to Somalia, income per capita fell by

two-and-a-half percent.

<p>

The colonial leaders from the time of fascism may be accused of

many things but not of ignorance. The neocolonials of the political

parties, on the other hand, didn't know the first thing about it.

Actually, they didn't need to as long as they were able to add up,

especially in their own favour. Italian development aid finally

went under in a sea of scandal. It was rescued by examining judge,

Vittorio Paraggio. 

<p>

How hard Paraggio worked can be assessed from the fact that

ex-Socialist leader Craxi, the symbol of national corruption,

attributed to him a whole file of poisonous insinuations. Despite

calls for extradition, Craxi is still sitting high and dry in

Tunisia, where he has little need to worry about the possibility of

extradition. After all, he's a close friend of the Tunisian

president who still remembers the Italian's Socialist "development

aid."

<p>

Of every three aid programmes, at least two failed, assuming it was

ever the intention that they should succeed. Many projects were not

even begun or never come off, or they proved unusable or were found

to be full of defects. As a rule, preliminary studies were

dispensed with. As were invitations for tenders and controls. More

than likely because everything was furtively arranged.

<p>

The examples are as revealing as they are monotonous. A useless dam

in Mozambique. An unusable textiles factory in Ethiopia. A

superfluous university in Somalia. A huge central hospital in a

region populated by nomads. A chemical fertilizer factory where

there was no electricity. Hundreds of silos of unusable material.

The export of redundant, unusable or harmful products.

<p>

In Somalia the rate applying for backhanders could rise as high as

17 percent. This money generally found its way into the coffers of

Siad Barre and his family and closest colleagues. General Aidid and

other mass murderers were also on the payroll of the Italian

development aid. Food aid was traded for weapons to support the war

in Somalia and other countries.

<p>

The most expensive (700 million guilders) and the most disputed

Italian development project, the clearing of an area of twenty

thousand hectares in Ethiopia, was a service to the dictator

Menghistu. Most of the eighty thousand Ethiopians employed on this

Tana-Beles project were the political opponents of Menghistu, who

had deported them to this region. The project was destroyed in 1991

by the guerrillas of the Popular Liberation Front of Tigr&#233;.

<p>

Notorious also was the extortionately expensive road from Garoe to

Bosaso in Somalia, intended for the transport of the troops of Siad

Barre to the guerrilla territory.

<p>

The money went to dictatorial regimes, not to the people. Not a

single condition was attached to the money relating to

democratization or human rights. Siad Barre, a close friend of

Craxi, was supported by Italy up to the last. Little wonder, then,

that in the - failed - Restore Hope operation, the Italian

contingent was given anything but a warm welcome by the population.

Italy's African policy was based on blind self-interest and the

equally blind and shameless support of the regimes in power, since

that was the most effective way to achieve the ultimate objective

of the African policy: by fair means or foul and inexorably, the

Italians and their African friends had to profit by it.

<p>

Craxi had it right, when as personal representative of UN Secretary

General, P&#233;rez de Cu&#233;llar, he had to produce a report on the Third

World's foreign debt. "Whoever accumulates wealth," he wrote

cynically, "generally does so at the expense of someone else." At

the same time, Andreotti was heard to declare that Italy was

heading the battle on behalf of development.

<p>

Italy's old politics have collapsed, and as yet there are no signs

of a new order. Foreign policy is also a huge vacuum. And, as far

as Africa is concerned, it's just as well.

<h3>TAXI CYCLISTS PEDAL FROM POVERTY</h3>
<i>
With few buses or cars, the Kenyan city of Kisumu needs a reliable form of 
transport. In recent years, reports <b>Gemini News Service</b>, a growing number of 
enterprising cyclists have been whisking commuters to and from work in spartan 
comfort at minimum cost.<p>


By <b>ROBERT OTANI</b>,<br>
2 July 1996,<br>
Kisumu, Kenya     </i><hr><p>


Shortly after five each morning, Ochieng Okelo jumps onto his bicycle and 
heads for his favourite parking spot on the eastern suburbs of Kisumu, Kenya's 
third-largest city.<p>

He rides off with the parting words to his wife: "Anyango dear, pray for me 
that I should come back home in one piece. The roads have become so dangerous 
in Kenya."
Okelo earns a living from the energy-sapping job of transporting commuters to 
and from the centre of the sprawling community of half a million people about 
500 kilometres west of Nairobi.<p>

Kisumu is critically short of commuter vehicles. Few cars ply the routes 
between the centre and the suburbs. A typical Peugeot 404 jalopy groans under 
the weight of eight people. <p>

The government-owned Nyayo Bus Corporation is almost grinding to a halt, due 
mainly to mismanagement and a lack of spare parts. <p>

Okelo is one of more than 1,000 entrepreneurs whose bicycles answer the need 
for a readily available and cheap mode of commuter transport. High rates of 
unemployment and poverty in the neglected region have driven an increasing 
number of people in recent years to seek a living out of bicycle taxis.<p>

Their efforts can be generously rewarded.<p>

A typical operator charges eight shillings per kilometre. A trip from the 
suburbs to the city centre costs Sh40. An ambitious operator can make Shl2,000 
a month, which is the salary of a university lecturer and way above an average 
civil servant's pay.<p>

The initial investment is small. A standard bicycle costs Sh3,500. The 
operator has no fuel costs, although a good diet is required because of the 
heavy work. With maintenance costs low, most of the income can be pocketed.<p>

"I have been in this business for the past five years, and I can assure you I 
can never look back," Okelo told me before I climbed onto his crossbar for a 
ride.<p>

He was wearing what he called his professional uniform - a tough and 
weather-beaten pair of denim jeans and a sturdy short-sleeved shirt. <p>

"I love this work," he said. "At first it was pretty tedious and I almost gave 
it up, but now I'm used to it and, apart from the cash benefits, it's a form of 
exercise and a pleasure to me." <p>

The machine rocked and hopped and snaked its way along the pot-holed road. As 
we approached a steep hill, I asked my chauffeur if I should alight to reduce 
the weight. <p>

"Oh no!" the 38-year-old rider replied. "Nothing like that. If you do that, 
you will have the legal right to demand some refund. This is just like the 
sleek Mercedes Benzes the wadosi (bosses) travel in from the Kenatco taxi hire 
company in Nairobi. Only mine is a little less comfortable and much slower." <p>

I could not help but admire this cogent reasoning, and wondered aloud if it 
applied to all the bicycle taxi operators.<p>

"Oh yes! " he bellowed. "Once we agree on a certain distance and the fare, you 
are on throughout the journey, even if I have to push the bike with you on in 
case of a breakdown or crossing a river."<p>

When I finally came to my destination, the rider produced a slimy rug from a 
bag slung on the bicycle frame and began the ritual of polishing his machine.
"I have to do this at the end of every journey," he said with a wry smile. <p>

"Apart from doing this for the sake of my customers, I owe a lot of whatever I 
can stake claim to, by way of property, to this iron horse.<p>

"It has given me not only a wife and children," explained the father of four, 
"but also a good house and a piece of land on which I grow sugar cane, which I 
sell to the nearby Muhoroni sugar company. Things like school fees and the bike 
do not worry me any more." <p>

This means of commuter transport may be compared to the Asian rickshaw, but 
the latter contrivance has one advantage - a hood to protect the passenger from 
the elements.<p>

"Right now, we're liaising with the jua kali (informal sector artisans) to 
have hoods fixed on our machines for greater convenience to our customers," 
Okelo says. <p>

The taxi cyclists have also contacted the government with a view to forming a 
cooperative society. <p>

"This mode of transport is becoming increasingly important to this town, which 
has only one car to every 100 residents," says the Kisumu district cooperative 
officer. "Thus the government will do everything possible to help them get the 
most out of their venture." <p>

<h1>Rivers - The Facts</h1>





<font size=+1>For centuries the great river systems of the South have watered the fields,
put fish on the table and acted as avenues of communication with the outside
world. Their importance gives them a crucial place in the cosmology of myth
and religion. But now rampant industrialism has brought competing demands
that threaten both traditional ways of life and the river eco-systems themselves.</font><p>
<hr><p>

<br><br>


<br clear=all><br><br><br>



<h3>The Nile</h3>

<b>Eco-system: </b>The longest river in the world. The Blue Nile rises in the Ethiopian
highlands and the White Nile flows out of Lake Victoria through the tropical
plains of Southern Sudan and the great Sudd swamps. They join together just
north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum and their combined flow survives
the arid journey through the Nubian and Arabian deserts to the Mediterranean.
Almost all Egyptians live clustered close to the Nile's banks. <BR>
<BR>
<b>Threats:  </b>The Aswan High Dam  - one of the world's largest  -
has proved a mixed blessing. One gallon in five of the Nile's water evaporates
from Lake Nasser behind the dam. Lack of silt and improper drainage in downstream
fields means serious problems with water-logging and salination. Dependable
water supplies mean new agricultural production but often for thirsty export
crops like cotton. Sea erosion and lack of silt have reduced the Nile's
fertile delta and the river is now a mere trickle at its mouth. <BR>
<BR><BR>


<h3>The Amazon</h3>

<b>Eco-system: </b>The largest river in the world in <BR>
volume of water and drainage area and one of the world's widest, varying
between 6 and 10 kms. Originating in Peru, it carries 1,000 million tons
of sediment a year into the Atlantic Ocean in Brazil and the patch of brown
at its mouth can be seen darkening the South Atlantic in satellite photos.
Vast reaches of the Amazon basin are still essentially unmapped and little-known.
<p>

<b>Threats:  </b>Massive logging campaigns have dramatically increased erosion and
caused international concern that rainforest destruction will contribute
to ozone depletion and global warming. While the slow-flowing Amazon has
been saved from dam construction, Brazil's official 'Plan 2010' envisages
80 dams on its tributaries. Dams like the Balbina on the Vartna are flooding
arable lands, uprooting inhabitants and adding to rainforest destruction.
Watershed stability is threatened by clear-cutting for cattle rearing. <font size=-1>4</font><BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<h3>The Yangtze</h3>

<b>Eco-system: </b>Known as the 'Long River' or 'The River of Golden Sand', the
Yangtze is the longest river in Asia. It rises in the Tanglha mountains
very near Tibet and flows through Szechwan and Hunan to enter the Yellow
Sea near Shanghai. Some of its 600 million annual tons of mud and silt,
gets deposited on its fertile delta and Chongming Island at the river's
mouth. The Yangtze has 700 tributaries and its drainage basin covers 20%
of China's total land area.<font size=-1>6</font> One in 13 people on the planet live in its
basin.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Threats:  </b>The Yangtze's dangerous floods have drowned 300,000 people this
century alone.  For centuries a system of dikes held back floods -
some as ancient as the eighth century are still in working order. The Three
Gorges Dam will be the world's biggest and is projected to control flooding
and provide energy-inefficient Chinese factories with hydro-power. It will
cost $20 billion, take 20 years to build and flood a million people from
their homes. Some 300,000 farmers will lose their land and controversies
rage on the dam's effectiveness in controlling floods and long-term social
and ecological costs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<h3>The Ganges</h3>

<b>Eco-system:  </b>The Ganges rises in the Himalayan glaciers in the mountainous
region of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It flows 2,480 kms through
India to enter the Bay of Bengal where it forms one of the world's largest
deltas made up of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. The width
of its flood plain varies between two and eight kms.<font size=-1>5  </font><BR>
<BR>
<b>Threats:  </b>The waters of the Ganges are considered sacred in Hindu mythology,
but are nonetheless heavily polluted, partly from the 40,000 people cremated
yearly at Benares, but mainly from the distilleries, refineries, chemical
factories and fertilizer complexes along the banks, especially at the city
of Kanpur. Earthquake danger due to over-damming endangers over 100 villages
and the town of Hardwar.<font size=-1>5</font> Large-scale irrigation projects started a century
ago and 500 new ones in the last 40 years have displaced millions of poor
farmers and altered the volume speed and silt load of the river's flow.<BR>
<BR><br>


<h3>The Zaire <BR>
(Congo)</h3>

<b>Eco-system: </b>The source of the Zaire (meaning river) is the Lualaba river
which rises in the Zairian province of Katanga near the Zambian border.
It heads north, then west, then south swallowing <BR>
river after river in its rush to discharge 1.4 million cubic feet per second
into the Atlantic Ocean. The banks of the Zaire are heavily forested and
its relatively slow and navigable course is punctuated by wild rapids at
the Porte d'Enfer and the Stanley and Inga Falls.<font size=-1>6 </font>The Zaire has long been
an African trade and communications route, home to several pre-colonial
kingdoms like the Luba inland and the Kongo near the coast. <p>

<b>Threats:  </b>Despite the Inga dam and power site and some localized pollution
the Zaire is largely unaffected by industry. Overfishing is a potential
problem. But blueprints to divert a massive amount of flow north into the
Sahel to solve drought problems there have the support of Zaire's President
Mobutu. This would be one of the largest-ever water diversions - in
one version carrying 100 cubic kilometres of water annually (more than the
flow of the Nile). The developmental and ecological problems of cutting
the Zaire's flow and transporting the fish, insects and diseases of tropical
rainforest into a semi-arid desert are unimaginable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<center><h2>Down the Drain</h2></center>
Global water use has tripled since 1950 to 4,340 cubic kms - 8 times
the annual flow of the Mississippi. Some 65% of this is used in agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
More than 10% of the world's irrigated land suffers from yield-suppressing
salt build-up which is spreading at the rate of 1.5 million hectares a year.
Currently less than 40% of water used in irrigation ends up benefiting crops.<font size=-1>3</font><BR>
<BR>
Engineers have now built 36,000 dams worldwide. Construction continues at
the rate of 170 dams a year. An estimated 1% of dam capacity is lost every
year as reservoirs become clogged with a million tons of silt (about 10%
of global river discharge). This fertile silt is also lost to downstream
farmers.<font size=-1>4</font><BR>
<BR>
Farmers could cut water use by <BR>
10-50%, industry by 40-90% and cities by 1/3 with no sacrifice to economic
output or quality of life.<font size=-1>3</font><BR>

<center>Why Community Radio?

<h3>Community Radio for  development, human rights and the
environment</h3></center>

<br clear=left>

<blockquote>





<hr align=left width=30%><b>By Francis Rolt<br>
July 1996</b><hr align=left width=30%><p>


Community radio has enormous potential in both rural and urban settings in
the South. It can raise awareness on issues such as the position of women,
play a part in improving literacy and education, and provide information on
health, the environment, agriculture, democracy, as well as such things as
landmines. <p>

It can do this over a larger area and for far less money than
any team of outreach workers, paramedics or literacy trainers. This is not
to say that radio can do these things alone, or that community radio does
away with the need for trainers and educators, but it can enormously
increase their reach and success rate, as well as providing information in
areas where outreach workers are rarely able to visit. <p>

<font size=2><b>Photo: Childrens' Radio Project, Khayelitsha, South Africa. ©Copyright: <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Coppi/">Coppi e. V.</a></b></font><p>



Of course any kind
of radio campaign has to be followed up with visits by the local education
or health team (for example) - to answer questions, correct
misapprehensions and to ensure that the right message is getting through -
but such visits supplement information which can be repeated again and
again on the radio, hammering home a message.<p>

A health team, for example, may visit a remote, rural village, spend some
time trying to gather busy people together, only to leave again a few hours
later, perhaps not to return for a week or a month, by which time any
information imparted may well have been forgotten. <p>

But a simple radio
message, thirty seconds or a minute long, repeated ten or twenty times a
day can help ensure that the main message is not lost or forgotten during
the period that the health professionals, paramedics, teachers or trainers
are not there. <p>

For example, in central Mali, a small community radio
station (Radio Daande Douentza) supported by <b><a href="../../../oxfam/index.html">OXFAM (UK)</a></b> reaches a
listenership of 92,500 people with such messages at a cost of only £0.25 (35 - 40 U.S. cents)
per listener per year. What other means of passing on information to a
largely illiterate population with many repeated messages and information
costs so little?<p>

In addition, community radio is itself an empowering tool for any community
- whether it be ethnic, linguistic or simply poor - which is ignored or
insufficiently catered for by state, national and/or commercial radio and
television. <p>

<b>By broadcasting from the community to the community, about
everyday problems and real issues, about the community's own history and
culture, and in the local language or dialect, community radio can empower
by giving people a greater sense of their own value and
potential.</b><p>

<center>Community Radio in the South</center><p>



<blockquote>



<hr align=left width=30%><b>By Francis Rolt<br>
July 1996</b><hr align=left width=30%><p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Latin America
</h2>
<blockquote>



The first community stations started broadcasting in <b>Latin America</b>
nearly fifty years ago. The legal status of community radio in different
countries has not always been clear; some stations are still illegal
operations while others, which may have started out as clandestine
broadcasters (notably <i>Radio Venceremos</i> in El Salvador), have since
been given licenses and some freedom. <p>

Successive regimes in different South
and Central American countries have either supported community radio,
tolerated it or suppressed it by revoking licenses, destroying equipment,
and arresting or 'disappearing' staff . <p>

But as regimes or policies change
so attitudes to community radio can change - in 1995 the Mexican Government
tried to close down the thirty year old <i>Radio Huayacocotla</i>, but
after national and international condemnation the authorities backed down.<p>

Also in Mexico, in the state of Chiapas, microradio programmes aligned with
the rebel Zapatistas can be heard, while in downtown Mexico City last
Autumn, a central traffic island became the base for <i>Radio
TeleVerdad</i>  ('Radio Tell-the-Truth'), providing five-watt FM
transmission while hundreds of thousands of vehicles whizzed by.<p>

In general, however, community broadcasters are now well-established and/or
tolerated in South and Central America - in Colombia for example, where the
community radio movement began only ten years ago, the Ministry of
Communications granted one thousand new community radio licenses in
1995.<p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Caribbean

</h2>
<blockquote>

The first community station in the <b>Caribbean</b> went on the air only in
1995 in Haiti, where the new government has a refreshingly positive
attitude to community radio; in 1995 Mallard Concepts set up four stations
in some of the remotest coastal areas and started work on the construction
of seven more small stations which were expected to open in 1996.<p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Africa
</h2>

<blockquote>




In <b>Africa</b> radio is undoubtedly the most important medium of
communication, but the development of community radio has been slower than
in Latin America, and some early experiments collapsed and failed in the
sixties and seventies. <p>

Until recently autonomous community radio existed
in few African countries, but there were a number of rural radio  stations
- usually managed from the capital by national broadcasting systems through
a government department. <p>

<font size=2><b>Photo: Childrens' Radio Project, Khayelitsha, South Africa. ©Copyright: <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Coppi/">Coppi e. V.</a></b></font><p>



However, since the late 1980s many African
governments have loosened up and now allow a more genuine form of community
radio, although in general it is still integrated into national
broadcasting structures; in Senegal it is a sector of government, in Ghana
a department, and in Zaire a state-owned enterprise. <p>

Nonetheless there are,
for instance, nineteen independent, rural or community stations in Mali
alone, a proliferation due entirely to the sudden freedom of the press
instituted in 1991. And the vast spaces of Mauritania also boast at least
four independent rural radio stations.<p>

The new regime in South Africa is living up to its promise to
democratise the air-waves - although the South African Independent
Broadcasting Authority has been criticised for issuing a high proportion of
the recently awarded seventy nine community licenses to religious and
ethnic stations (in a country still recovering from the divisions caused by
apartheid). <p>

Despite this, one of the most exciting projects
anywhere is the <i>Eyabantwana Radio Station</i>, or the children's radio
project in Khayalitsha - a very poor and violent residential area near Cape
Town - which aims to have children between seven and fourteen running the
station themselves within a year.<p>

Other African countries with community or rural radio stations include,
Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia and Uganda.<p>

</blockquote>

<h2>South Asia</h2>

<blockquote>

In much of <b>South Asia</b> radio is perhaps the means of communication
with the greatest potential for growth and use in development. However, in
most of the region the situation is still tightly controlled by
governments, and state monopolies rule. <p>

With a few exceptions community
stations hardly exist in the region. In Nepal, following the 1990
revolution, the first community radio - <i>Radio Sagarmatha</i> - was all set
to begin broadcasting in 1995, but the station's license to broadcast is
still not approved at the time of writing (July 1996). But once this first
station does go on the air there is likely to be a rush as at least eight
other licences have been applied for.<p>

In Sri Lanka the <i>Mahaweli Community Radio</i>, a branch of the national
broadcasting system, has been broadcasting since 1981, but has always faced
major budgetary problems - perhaps partly because it seems to have been set
up without much thought about sustainability. Also in Sri Lanka,
<i>Guirandurukotte Community Radio</i> has been running for nearly ten
years.<p>

The situation in general in South Asia is likely to change in the near
future. In general multi-lateral donors and agencies are exerting
considerable pressure on South Asian governments to deregulate the
airwaves. Indeed, in India at the end of 1995 the Supreme Court directed
the Government to end its monopoly of electronic media, and to create an
independent and autonomous broadcasting authority, thus theoretically
opening up the possibility for community broadcasters there. <p>

And other
South Asian governments may also decide to, or be forced to, relax their
hold on broadcasting, despite a rather cautious beginning.<p>

</blockquote>

<h2> South East Asia</h2>

<blockquote>

In <b>South East Asia</b> the Philippines stands out as an exception,
largely because its broadcasting system was influenced by commercial
traditions from the United States, and there have been a number of rural
radio projects established by universities and other institutions. <p>

The
big recent success story seems to be <i>Tambuli</i>, a community radio
project financed by the Danish International Development Agency (Danida)
and administered by UNESCO's International Programme for the Development of
Communication (IPDC). In 1996 Tambuli won the IPDC's rural
communication prize. <p>

The project aims to set up community media centres in
some 12 isolated and economically depressed areas in the Philippines, to
democratize communication in the country and to empower people through
media. Each community was to organize its own FM radio station, using
low-powered (20-watt) transmitters and simple production equipment. <p>

By
1995, at the end of the pilot phase, six such centres were operating.
"Awards and prizes do not constitute our goals," cautions Louie Tabing,
TAMBULI's project manager,"The true measure of the project's worth is how
much people and individuals in the community have changed because of
us."<p>

In 1994, underground radio stations sprang up in Taiwan and became the
focus of the then military government's attention. These stations opened
hot lines for call-ins, enabling taxi drivers, home makers and other
listeners to become street commentators on political events and social
issues. <p>

The immediacy of call-in dialogues inspired popular participation
and brought forth opinions that had been ignored by officially sanctioned
radio stations. <p>

On August 1, 1994, the KMT government used helicopters and
a police force of six thousand to crack down simultaneously on all 14
underground radio stations in Taiwan. This attack provoked mass protests
and a riot in the capital city, Taipei. Some stations resumed broadcast
almost instantly and received large sums of money from supportive
listeners, and there can be little doubt that these stations played an
important role in the democratisation process in Taiwan.<p>

Since 1991 Vietnam has established a few, relatively independent community
stations operated by community representatives. But with these few
exceptions  South East Asian governments seem unwilling to lose control of
the airwaves, and state national or national commercial stations dominate.<p><p>

<h2>Financial planning for a community radio station</h2><p>

	<br clear=left><br>




<ol>	<li> What are the overall financial requirements for equipping and running the
station or studio? Divide them into intitial investments, running costs,
depreciation of equipment (for re-investment), fees and taxes, etc.<p>

<li>	Running expenses must be broken down into different budgets: e.g. renting
and supply (energy, water, etc.), programme acquisition (including courtesy
fees), programme production (including consumption materials), personnel
(staff salaries, free-lancers' remuneration etc.), service and maintenance,
general administration (travel expenses, telephone), etc.<p>

<li>	Implement regular control methods if possible ensure that the annual
financial plan is screened by a professional business consultant or
chartered accountant.<p>

<li>	What are the chances of generating income by selling air-time to third
parties,  getting programmes sponsored, and/or advertisements? What other
sources of regular income exist? Would this income be sufficient to cope
with the running costs, and to make savings for necessary
re-investment?<p>

<h2>Administration and organisation checklist for planning community
radio </h2><p>

	<br clear=left><br>





<ol><li>	Consider the broadcast laws in your country and the legal procedures for
allocation of frequencies. Which authority determines the frequencies? Is
the frequency allocation limited in time?<p>

<li>	Which authorities are likely to to try to exert control on either the use
of frequencies and/or programme content? How should you liaise with government
officials and private enterprises relevant to your work?<p>

<li>	Are there networking possibilities for your service (programme exchange
with other stations/studios), or sideways connections (on-site connection
of different stations)?<p>

<li>	What management, administrative and editorial structures need to be
installed? How is programme production going to be organised (editorial
control)? Who is responsible for station or studio management and
networking?<p>

<li>	How much personnel do you need (creative, administrative, technical) for
the hours you intend to broadcast? And where can the staff be trained or
up-graded? To what extent can the programmes be made by the listeners
themselves (with a little help and training)?<p>

<li>	Are there organisations of private radio stations or programme producers
in your area/country? Can you join as a member in order to share resources
(programme input, training, service, etc.) and joint marketing
activities?<p>

<li>	What are the prospects of going commercial? Consider legal possibilities
and restrictions. What is the market for selling air time or having
programmes sponsored? Is there a code of advertising? Would advertising as
such harm the cultural integrity of your target audience? How much
advertising would you allow (percentage of total air time)? Can you exclude
certain organisations, companies or products from advertising or allocation
of air time?<p>

<h2>Programme checklist for planning community radio</h2><p>

<ol>
<li>  Is there a specific demand for information, education and/or
entertainment in a given area that can be covered by broadcasting?<p>

<li>	Is radio the best way to respond to this demand? What is its special role
in comparison to and in connection with other media and/or the traditional
forms of communication in the area?<p>

<li>	What role does radio play in the overall media strategy of your
organisation, and what are your special communication aims in this field?
How do they fit into your overall plan or development programme for the
area concerned? Are there special social issues you want to promote?<p>

<li>	What are your target audience's communication needs? Which topics are
they interested in and which programme formats would they prefer? What is
their taste in music? Identify appropriate research methods (survey,
interviews, group discussion etc) to clarify these questions.<p>

<li>	How would your programmes fit into your listeners' daily routine? What do
they do at what time of the day? What social contact do they have? What
other media do they use? Make an appropriate programme schedule
accordingly.<p>

<li>	Is it necessary to put a whole new channel on the air, or would it be
sufficient to supply programmes to other stations?<p>

<li>	Identify appropriate marketing tools to promote the station or programme
identity. Launch programme-related side activities such as publications,
advertisements, lotteries, listeners' clubs, local festivals, etc. Ensure
continuous feedback and audience participation programmes. Allow access
programming for campaigners and interest groups related to the topics you
wish to promote.<p>

<li>	Constantly evaluate the changing audience demands. Make regular audience
research a permanent element of programme design and re-design. Give
institutional space for creative programme development. Make sure that the
programmes' style, language and accent fit the communication patterns of
your audience.<p>

Conf&#233;rence internationale sur la population et le d&#233;veloppement qui aura lieu au Caire en

septembre 1994.</b>

<p>

<h3>R&#233;sum&#233; des probl&#232;mes pos&#233;s dans l'avis</h3>



Quelle peut &ecirc;tre la contribution des Pays-Bas, dans le cadre de leur politique de coop&#233;ration au

d&#233;veloppement, &#224; la formulation et &#224; la mise en oeuvre d'une politique

d&#233;mographique? C'est sur cette question que le ministre de la Coop&#233;ration a demand&#233; au

Conseil d'&#233;mettre un avis, en vue de la pr&#233;paration de la Conf&#233;rence internationale sur la

population et le d&#233;veloppement, qui aura lieu au Caire en septembre 1994. La d&#233;l&#233;gation

n&#233;erlandaise &#224; la Conf&#233;rence sera &#233;galement appel&#233;e &#224; faire

conna&icirc;tre son point de vue sur l'avortement, sur la relation entre le droit des femmes &#224; choisir

ou non d'avoir des enfants et les objectifs d&#233;mographiques, ainsi que sur la relation entre les droits

des femmes et les responsabilit&#233;s des hommes. Le Conseil aborde ces diff&#233;rents points dans cet

avis. 

<p>

La politique d&#233;mographique touchant l'individu dans ses relations, ses normes et ses valeurs les plus

intimes, ainsi que dans ses strat&#233;gies de survie, elle constitue un sujet d&#233;licat, suscitant souvent

des r&#233;actions passionn&#233;es. Pourtant un consensus se d&#233;gage de plus en plus au niveau

mondial sur la n&#233;cessit&#233; de freiner la croissance d&#233;mographique mondiale. Cette prise de

conscience s'explique notamment par l'attention accrue apport&#233;e au d&#233;veloppement durable. En

effet, la croissance d&#233;mographique repr&#233;sente une charge de plus en plus grande pour

l'environnement. Mais des mod&#232;les non durables de production et de consommation portent tout

autant atteinte &#224; l'environnement. Les probl&#232;mes r&#233;sultent pr&#233;cis&#233;ment de la

relation complexe entre la question d&#233;mographique et des mod&#232;les de production et de

consommation qui se caract&#233;risent par une r&#233;partition in&#233;gale des richesses et du pouvoir.

<p>

Ce sont surtout les pauvres qui voient dans les enfants une s&#233;curit&#233; pour l'avenir. Et, dans le

m&ecirc;me temps, ce sont les pauvres qui, faute d'avoir acc&#232;s aux moyens de r&#233;gulation des

naissances, se trouvent limit&#233;s dans leurs choix au niveau de la procr&#233;ation. Par ailleurs, il est

connu que le manque d'acc&#232;s &#224; l'enseignement, aux soins de sant&#233; et au travail conduit

&#224; une f&#233;condit&#233; &#233;lev&#233;e. La politique d&#233;mographique doit donc

s'inscrire dans une strat&#233;gie globale de lutte contre la pauvret&#233;, et inversement. Car une

croissance d&#233;mographique qui reste &#233;lev&#233;e entrave pr&#233;cis&#233;ment la lutte

contre la pauvret&#233;. Et il est ainsi de plus en plus difficile de r&#233;aliser l'objectif de la

qualit&#233; de l'existence pour le plus grand nombre. La croissance d&#233;mographique appara&icirc;t

donc comme &#233;troitement li&#233;e &#224; la pauvret&#233;.

<p>

Mais la croissance d&#233;mographique n'est pas toujours le seul ou le principal probl&#232;me. La

dispersion g&#233;ographique, la pyramide des &#226;ges (vieillissement) et la migration ont

&#233;galement une influence sur la structure d'un groupe de population et peuvent engendrer des

probl&#232;mes. L'urbanisation en particulier, c'est-&#224;-dire la concentration croissante de la

population dans les villes, constitue un probl&#232;me de plus en plus aigu. Cela signifie donc qu'il n'y a

pas un seul probl&#232;me d&#233;mographique, et qu'il n'y a donc pas de solution unique.

<p>

La f&#233;condit&#233; - c'est &#224; dire le nombre d'enfants par femme - varie consid&#233;rablement

en fonction de leur situation socio-&#233;conomique, de leur environnement culturel et religieux et de leurs

perspectives d'avenir, lesquels sont &#233;videmment indissociables de celles des hommes. Toutefois,

l'in&#233;galit&#233; entre les hommes et les femmes au niveau du pouvoir de d&#233;cision, aussi bien

dans les relations individuelles qu'&#224; l'&#233;chelle publique, exerce une influence consid&#233;rable

sur les mod&#232;les en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation. Dans la plupart des pays, les joies et les

charges de l'enfantement et de l'&#233;ducation des enfants sont tr&#232;s in&#233;galement

r&#233;parties. On constate, dans la formulation et la mise en oeuvre de la politique d&#233;mographique,

une tendance &#224; faire des femmes l'instrument d'une politique de r&#233;gulation des naissances. Les

femmes se trouvent ainsi limit&#233;es dans leur autonomie, tout en devant assumer la pleine

responsabilit&#233; de la r&#233;duction de la croissance d&#233;mographique. La traduction de la

politique d&#233;mographique en programmes de planning familial ne r&#233;pond pas suffisamment aux

besoins des femmes.

<p>

&Agrave; la suite de l'&#233;volution des conceptions sur la r&#233;gulation des naissances, les services

de planning familial ne sont plus uniquement consid&#233;r&#233;s comme un moyen de r&#233;duire la

croissance d&#233;mographique, mais plut&ocirc;t comme un &#233;l&#233;ment d'un train plus vaste de

mesures ax&#233;es en particulier sur la sant&#233; des femmes en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation.

Ces mesures portent non seulement sur la fourniture de moyens contraceptifs, l'&#233;ducation sexuelle et

la pr&#233;vention, mais aussi sur le diagnostic et le traitement des maladies et autres infections

sexuellement transmissibles, ainsi que sur l'assistance m&#233;dicale en cas de grossesse non

d&#233;sir&#233;e. Des &#233;tudes effectu&#233;es r&#233;cemment sur l'efficacit&#233; des

programmes de planning familial par les institutions oeuvrant dans le domaine de la politique

d&#233;mographique, telles que le PNUAP, la Banque mondiale et le Conseil d&#233;mographique,

indiquent que le succ&#232;s de ces programmes est moins tributaire de facteurs quantitatifs que de facteurs

qualitatifs (traitements respectant davantage l'individu, mesures ad&#233;quates d'accompagnement, etc.).

<p>

Par ailleurs, dans le d&#233;bat international, ces mesures sont le plus souvent plac&#233;es dans une

perspective plus large: le planning familial n'est qu'un des &#233;l&#233;ments qui permettent de freiner la

croissance d&#233;mographique. En effet, cette croissance est le r&#233;sultat &#224; la fois de la

f&#233;condit&#233; non d&#233;sir&#233;e, de la f&#233;condit&#233; d&#233;sir&#233;e et du

"moment" d&#233;mographique, c'est-&#224;- dire l'accroissement du nombre de femmes et d'hommes

f&#233;conds &#224; la suite de l'augmentation des naissances dans la g&#233;n&#233;ration

pr&#233;c&#233;dente. Le planning familial n'est efficace qu'au niveau de la f&#233;condit&#233; non

d&#233;sir&#233;e, elle n'a aucune influence sur d'autres &#233;l&#233;ments d&#233;terminant la

croissance d&#233;mographique. Cela signifie que la politique d&#233;mographique doit &ecirc;tre

int&#233;gr&#233;e dans la politique globale, comme &#233;tant un aspect d'une politique socio-

&#233;conomique plus large. De plus, les politiques &#233;ducative et sanitaire devraient &#233;galement

&ecirc;tre adapt&#233;es en fonction des objectifs de la politique d&#233;mographique. En effet, la

dur&#233;e de scolarit&#233; des femmes reste toujours le meilleur indicateur du nombre d'enfants qu'elles

auront: plus le niveau d'enseignement est &#233;lev&#233;, moins la femme a d'enfants. La

mortalit&#233; infantile joue &#233;galement un r&ocirc;le dans l'ins&#233;curit&#233; quant &#224;

l'avenir. Il importe donc d'accorder davantage de cr&#233;dits aux secteurs de l'&#233;ducation et de la

sant&#233;, et la politique socio-&#233;conomique doit veiller &#224; modifier la r&#233;partition des

t&#226;ches entre les hommes et les femmes. Le souci d'assurer ses vieux jours a une influence sur les

d&#233;cisions relatives au nombre d'enfants, tout en permettant de satisfaire les besoins du nombre

croissant de personnes &#226;g&#233;es dans de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement. Le rythme du

ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de vieillissement fait qu'il est souhaitable de tenir compte dans la r&#233;partition

des cr&#233;dits des besoins sp&#233;cifiques des personnes &#226;g&#233;es, dont les femmes

constituent un pourcentage &#233;lev&#233;. Enfin, l'urbanisation n&#233;cessite d'adapter les mesures

sanitaires en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation aux conditions de vie sp&#233;cifiques et aux

diff&#233;rences de comportement au niveau de la sexualit&#233; et de la procr&#233;ation dans les villes.



<p>



<h3>Conclusions et recommandations</h3>



Il est important que les gens aient acc&#232;s &#224; des &#233;quipements et des mesures sanitaires de

qualit&#233; en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation, afin d'&ecirc;tre en mesure de faire librement le choix

du nombre d'enfants qu'ils souhaitent. Cela s'applique tout particuli&#232;rement aux femmes qui n'ont que

peu d'influence sur leurs relations sexuelles et qui ne peuvent pas d&#233;cider elles-m&ecirc;mes de leur

f&#233;condit&#233;. L'acc&#232;s limit&#233; des filles et des femmes &#224; l'enseignement et la

r&#233;partition traditionnelle des t&#226;ches au sein de la famille d&#233;terminent le cadre dans lequel

elles doivent faire leurs choix en mati&#232;re de maternit&#233;. Et, dans bien des pays, la

l&#233;gislation contribue &#224; restreindre les possibilit&#233;s de choix.

<p>

Le Conseil arrive &#224; la conclusion que le planning familial doit &ecirc;tre plac&#233; sous le signe de

la politique sanitaire en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation. Il est essentiel que les programmes qui sont

pr&#233;sent&#233;s dans le cadre du planning familial comprennent un large &#233;ventail de services de

qualit&#233;. Si l'on ne fournit pas les bons contraceptifs (par exemple la pilule en cas de contre-indication

ou un st&#233;rilet alors qu'il y a infection) ou si l'on ne donne pas suffisamment d'informations sur les

effets secondaires, les femmes renonceront &#224; participer aux programmes. Outre la mise &#224;

disposition de contraceptifs, il faut &#233;galement offrir aux femmes des possibilit&#233;s de diagnostic et

de traitement des maladies sexuellement transmissibles et des infections des organes de reproduction. Il faut

veiller &#224; toucher &#233;galement les jeunes ainsi que les femmes non mari&#233;es ou

c&#233;libataires. Le Conseil estime qu'il faut &#233;galement conscientiser les hommes, par des

programmes d'information appropri&#233;s, par rapport &#224; leurs responsabilit&#233;s en

mati&#232;re de comportement sexuel et de f&#233;condit&#233;.

<p>

Le train de mesures doit &#233;galement comprendre la possibilit&#233; d'avortement m&#233;dicalement

assist&#233; pour les femmes confront&#233;es &#224; une grossesse non d&#233;sir&#233;e. Les

grossesses non d&#233;sir&#233;es peuvent r&#233;sulter du manque d'acc&#232;s &#224; de bonnes

m&#233;thodes de r&#233;gulation des naissances ou de l'&#233;chec des moyens utilis&#233;s, mais

aussi, dans bien des cas, de la violence exerc&#233;e contre les femmes, du viol, que se soit ou non au sein

de la famille, et dans des situations de guerre. Le Conseil consid&#232;re qu'il faut attirer l'attention des

pouvoirs publics sur leurs responsabilit&#233;s en mati&#232;re de sant&#233; des femmes et de

l&#233;galisation de l'avortement pour permettre des avortements m&#233;dicalement s&ucirc;rs.

<p>

Le Conseil arrive &#224; la conclusion en concernant du paiement aux groupes cibles de primes visant

&#224; r&#233;duire la f&#233;condit&#233;, qu'un tel instrument se heurte &#224; des objections de

principe et &#224; de grandes difficult&#233;s pratiques au niveau de la mise en oeuvre. Le Conseil est

d'avis que, dans la pratique, il n'existe pas de m&#233;thode, &#233;conomiquement fructueuse, qui offre

une garantie suffisante que de tels instruments ne conduisent pas &#224; des abus, &#233;tant donn&#233;

les conditions de corruption, le statut peu &#233;lev&#233; des femmes et la pauvret&#233; qui

r&#232;gnent dans ces pays. Le Conseil consid&#232;re, en revanche, que l'on pourrait indemniser les

frais engag&#233;s pour accro&icirc;tre l'accessibilit&#233; des services de planning familial, par exemple

en remboursant les frais de transport d'une visite &#224; la clinique.

<p>

Le Conseil recommande de soutenir davantage la recherche visant &#224; am&#233;liorer et &#224;

&#233;largir concr&#232;tement l'offre de m&#233;thodes de r&#233;gulation des naissances, la

pr&#233;f&#233;rence devant &ecirc;tre donn&#233;e &#224; la recherche sur les contraceptifs masculins.

Le Conseil recommande &#233;galement de soutenir les travaux de recherche portant sur des

m&#233;thodes dont les femmes peuvent contr&ocirc;ler elles-m&ecirc;mes l'utilisation. On peut songer

dans ce contexte aux travaux actuellement en cours sur l'&#233;laboration d'un gel protecteur contre

l'infection par le VIH, dont deux vari&#233;t&#233;s sont mises au point, l'une en tant que contraceptif,

l'autre en tant que simple moyen de protection contre l'infection et ne compromettant donc pas la

f&#233;condit&#233;. Le Conseil estime moins heureux de soutenir la recherche et l'inoculation de vaccins

immunologiques aux femmes, &#233;tant donn&#233; les dangers potentiels li&#233;s &#224; leur

application ainsi que le contr&ocirc;le limit&#233; que les femmes peuvent exercer sur ces m&#233;thodes.

<p>

Il faut chercher, dans la formulation de la politique d&#233;mographique, des possibilit&#233;s

concr&#232;tes de faire une plus grande place aux objectifs des populations cibles. Le Conseil

consid&#232;re qu'il est indispensable de concr&#233;tiser des m&#233;canismes de participation aux

programmes d&#233;mographiques. Des commissions de conseil ou d'encadrement, au sein desquelles

seraient repr&#233;sent&#233;es des organisations priv&#233;es, des organisations non gouvernementales

et en particulier des organisations de femmes, pourraient par exemple &ecirc;tre associ&#233;es &#224; la

formulation et &#224; la mise en oeuvre de programmes. De plus, les programmes doivent pr&#233;voir

des formes d'&#233;valuation conjointe avec les groupes cibles.

<p>

Le Conseil est d'avis qu'il faut engager un d&#233;bat ouvert avec l'&Eacute;glise catholique sur les effets

des conceptions qu'elle professe en mati&#232;re de sexualit&#233; et de r&#233;gulation de la

f&#233;condit&#233;.

<p>

Le Conseil souligne les points communs qui caract&#233;risent l'approche de nombreux mouvements

&#233;cologistes et mouvements f&#233;ministes. Ces points communs se manifestent tr&#232;s clairement

lorsqu'on soumet &#224; un examen critique les mod&#232;les actuels de d&#233;veloppement dans le

contexte du souci du d&#233;veloppement durable. Il n'est pas possible de modifier ces mod&#232;les sans

changer les rapports de force existants et la r&#233;partition in&#233;gale du pouvoir et des richesses.

Dans une telle approche, une place centrale serait donn&#233;e aux strat&#233;gies de survie et &#224; la

participation des pauvres. Une strat&#233;gie commune doit viser &#224; obtenir la promesse des

responsables politiques qu'ils affecteront davantage de cr&#233;dits &#224; une approche large et

int&#233;gr&#233;e des probl&#232;mes d&#233;mographiques.

<p>

En ce qui concerne le dialogue sur les probl&#232;mes d&#233;mographiques dans le Sud entre les

gouvernements des pays industrialis&#233;s et les gouvernements des pays en d&#233;veloppement, il

importe que le Nord ne cherche pas non plus &#224; fuir ses responsabilit&#233;s pour la r&#233;alisation

d'un d&#233;veloppement durable. C'est en effet le Nord qui, en adoptant des mod&#232;les de production

et de consommation non durables, s'approprie une partie disproportionnellement &#233;lev&#233;e des

ressources de la plan&#232;te. De l'avis du Conseil, les probl&#232;mes d&#233;mographiques ne

devraient pas conduire, dans les relations de d&#233;veloppement, &#224; de nouvelles formes de

conditionnalit&#233; impos&#233;es unilat&#233;ralement, mais plut&ocirc;t &#224; un dialogue

d'&#233;gal &#224; &#233;gal.

<p>

Deux membres du Conseil, qui faisaient partie du groupe de travail charg&#233; de la pr&#233;paration de

l'avis, y souscrivent pour une grande partie, notamment au fait de transmettre activement, au Caire,

l'id&#233;e d'une strat&#233;gie &#233;tendue et consistante et l'offre d'approfondir, dans un avis

ult&#233;rieur, la mise en oeuvre pratique d'une politique d&#233;mographique large. Ces membres ont

toutefois des opinions divergentes sur un certain nombre de points, dont les principales peuvent se

r&#233;sumer dans les termes suivants:

<ul>

<li>Le principal probl&#232;me d&#233;mographique est, de loin, la persistance de la croissance. Des

probl&#232;mes tels que l'urbanisation et le vieillissement en sont des corollaires. Le probl&#232;me de la

croissance d&#233;mographique m&#233;rite donc une attention prioritaire.

<li>Les mesures recommand&#233;es par le Conseil ne suffiront vraisemblablement pas &#224;

att&#233;nuer l'ampleur du probl&#232;me de la d&#233;mographie. Aussi longtemps en tout cas que

subsiste une croissance d&#233;mographique rapide, il faut recourir &#224; tous les moyens acceptables

pour r&#233;duire cette croissance, parmi lesquels le paiement, sous certaines conditions, de primes aux

groupes cibles en vue de promouvoir un abaissement de la f&#233;condit&#233;.

<li>Il faut fixer des priorit&#233;s plus pr&#233;cises en particulier en ce qui concerne l'&#233;tendue

des mesures &#224; mettre en place pour le planning familial et l'information &#224; ce sujet.

</ul>

<A NAME="first"><B>Children First</B></A><BR>

That children occupy such a comparatively high place on the international agenda today did not happen by chance. It is the result of years of pressure and lobbying by individuals and organisations as highlighted in Maggie Black's anniversary biography of UNICEF, Children First.<BR>

Ostensibly about UNICEF, the book is also an examination of the evolution in development thinking over the past fifty years with UNICEF acting as a mirror to those changes.<BR>

From its inception, UNICEF's remit has broadened to meet all the needs of children. Originally conceived as a short-term emergency relief organisation to help children in post-war Europe, it soon adopted an increasingly developmental role, helping children throughout the world. In the 1980s, under the guidance of Executive Director James Grant, UNICEF asserted the principle of "children first" in all macro-policy spheres, economic and developmental as well as humanitarian.<BR>

The 1980s also saw UNICEF move away from the "technical fix" to child survival, to favouring low cost public health techniques, such as mass immunisation. The setting of measurable child survival goals for the year 2000 and drawing up a plan of action to achieve them at the 1990 World Summit for Children, was the expression of this shift in thinking.<BR>

Today, in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF's focus is increasingly on looking beyond child survival and asking "survival for what?" Children First  argues that it will be through the implementation of the Convention, both in developing and industrialised countries, that the international prominence of the children's cause will be sustained.<BR>

<P>

Children First, published by Oxford University Press, is available from UNICEF shops or leading bookshops priced &pound;9.99 (ISBN 0-19 828088-20).<BR>

<B>Emergency Updates</B><BR>

<P>

<A NAME="niraq"><B>Northern Iraq</B></A><BR>

UNICEF programmes in Northern Iraq have been able to continue despite the recent escalation of fighting. All 38 UNICEF staff in Northern Iraq were reported to be safe.<BR>

UNICEF has a wide range of programmes covering health, nutrition, water and education throughout Iraq. Water quality has been improved through the provision of water treatment systems and constant monitoring of their effectiveness. In Northern Iraq, essential drugs are provided through 1,300 primary health care centres. Immunisation, controlling diarrhoeal diseases and reducing maternal mortality are among the main features of the UNICEF health programme in the region. UNICEF helped to negotiate a period of tranquillity to immunise approximately 63,000 children in Northern Iraq as part of Olympic Aid-Atlanta.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="burundi"><B>Burundi</B></A><BR>

International sanctions imposed on Burundi following the 25 July coup have forced UNICEF to drastically reduce its activities to help children in need. The biggest impact has been from the stopping of fuel supplies through Tanzania which has disrupted the work of relief agencies.<BR>

Due to the fuel shortage, travel outside the capital, Bujumbura, has been restricted. Burundi was on the verge of reaching 75 per cent immunisation of under one year-olds but there are now no supplies of polio or BCG (tuberculosis) vaccines left in the country.<BR>

As part of UNICEF's "Anti-War Agenda", launched in December 1995, the organisation believes that a child impact assessment should be carried out at the point when economic sanctions are imposed upon a country, followed by constant monitoring thereafter. In Burundi, UNICEF and other agencies are advocating protected supply routes for humanitarian assistance to children, including food supplies, fuel, vaccines and medical supplies.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="rwanda"><B>Rwanda</B></A><BR>

The last of the Rwandans who fled to Northern Burundi in 1994 have returned home to begin the process of rebuilding the country. A total of 62,000 refugees returned home during August -  the highest level of return to Rwanda since the 1994 exodus.<BR>

UNICEF has been working with other agencies to help the returnees at transit camps along the Rwandan border, providing food, shelter and clothing. UNICEF is registering all unaccompanied children and, so far, more than 20,000 unaccompanied children have been reunited with family members.<BR>

Within Rwanda, the Gitagata Re-education and Production Centre has been transferred from the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The Centre houses almost 200 children who were originally accused of genocide, but have subsequently been classed as criminally non-responsible under Rwandan law because they were less than 15 years old. The change in ministerial status is important as it means the Centre can now play a genuine role in the social re-integration of child prisoners.<BR>

UNICEF has also been strengthening its programme to restock primary schools. So far, a total of 1.6 million exercise books, 70,000 pencils, 80,000 pens, 2,000 globes and 60,000 slates have been distributed throughout the country.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="afghan"><B>Afghanistan</B></A><BR>

The re-opening of several vital roads to traffic, as a result of agreement between warring factions, has been a bright note in the current situation in Afghanistan. The Salang Pass, which carries the road between Kabul and northern Afghanistan, was re-opened after nearly three years of closure. Despite continuing problems with mines, traffic is moving in both directions.<BR>

Improving water supplies has been the focus of UNICEF's work in Afghanistan in the past month. UNICEF, together with other UN agencies and NGOs, has begun upgrading pipelines in Zabul and Jawzjan provinces, which will provide drinking water for 35,000 people.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="liberia"><B>Liberia</B></A><BR>

A clearer picture of the effect of the current civil war is emerging as the situation becomes slightly calmer. Over half the population of Monrovia fled their homes during intensive fighting and looting in April and May. An estimated 4,500 people died in fighting between factions and there has been massive structural damage. An estimated 476,000 people remain displaced in camps within Monrovia. Most of the camps lack adequate water and sanitation and there is a serious rubbish problem throughout the city.<BR>

The work of relief agencies was severely curtailed by the fighting with most expatriate staff evacuated and most local staff displaced. Agencies have been gradually resuming their activities, including food distribution, vaccinations, water supply and trauma counselling,  following a ceasefire on 31 May. The rights of Liberia's children are being severely compromised in the country at present, either deliberately or as a consequence of the war. In particular, there is widespread recruitment of children as soldiers and it is being reported that schools are being targeted for destruction as it is easier to recruit children who are not at school.<BR>

Despite this, there is a gradual return to normality. 

Health services which initially dropped to about 25 per cent of their pre-crisis level, have recovered to about 65 per cent with 27 out of 42 health facilities currently functioning.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="sierra"><B>Sierra Leone</B></A><BR>

A ceasefire between government and rebel RUF forces is generally holding, with sporadic violations of the ceasefire appearing to be related to food shortages amongst rebel troops. A number of major roads have been reopened and relief activities have been stepped up.<BR>

UNICEF is undertaking water supply and chlorination of existing wells in the townships of Freetown, Bo, Makeni, Kenema, Koidu, Magburaka, Port Loko and Kambia. Sanitation is being improved in camps for internally displaced people. A latrine disinfectant, dudustop, has been provided for over a thousand latrines in four camps.<BR>

To date, almost 120,000 children have been vaccinated against measles and received vitamin  supplements. Drugs and medical supplies have been provided to a German NGO for health programmes in the south of the country.<BR>

Women's groups received financial support and agricultural tools from UNICEF in the Western area. The groups are involved in soap production, backyard gardening and a bakery. Seeds and fertilizer have been distributed to farming organisations in Bo.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="sudan"><B>Sudan</B></A><BR>

UN agencies mounted an emergency relief operation in the Pochalla district of southern Sudan, last month, following severe floods. The flooding destroyed crops and left villages isolated. At least 15,000 people have been affected and preliminary surveys indicate that food aid will be necessary at least until the January harvest. UNICEF has delivered more than eight tonnes of emergency relief items, including blankets, oral-rehydration salts, medicines and primary-health kits.<BR>

Forty children attended the opening of the Totto-chan Centre for Child Trauma in Juba in southern Sudan, on 3 August. The centre will undertake advocacy, research and training on dealing with trauma.<BR>

<P>

<B>Other News</B><BR>

<P>

<A NAME="sexcong"><B>Action pledged on commercial sexual exploitation of children</B></A><BR>

The World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, which took place in August, has adopted a Declaration and Plan of Action to combat the problem.<BR>

Delegates from 126 countries, 300 NGOs and international agencies and 450 media representatives attended the Congress in Stockholm, which was co-sponsored by UNICEF. Proceedings were opened by Queen Silvia of Sweden who stated: "Our abhorrence, and the depth of our compassion, will be put to the test by our willingness to take action."<BR>

The Declaration calls on states to work more closely together and to criminalise the commercial sexual exploitation of children. UNICEF Executive Director, Carol Bellamy said: "It is a cruel fact that it is often children and not their exploiters who are arrested and treated as criminals when brothels are raided."<BR>

The Plan of Action identifies priorities for action in prevention, protection, recovery and re-integration, as well as child participation.<BR>

The Congress included workshops on sex tourism, health, education, children and pornography and the role of the media. This last workshop was addressed by UNICEF Special Representative for the Film Arts, Roger Moore, who called for "art with responsibility" criticising the increasing use of children's sexuality to sell products in the media to an adult market.<BR>

Mr Moore said "The creators of these images will argue this is art', but... surely we can't accept that the dignity, childhoods, even lives of thousands of children might be sacrificed for the sake of art without responsibility?"<BR>

<A NAME="saarc"><B>Child rights in Asia</B></A><BR>

Seven countries in south Asia have committed themselves to eliminating child labour from bonded work by the year 2000 and ending child labour by the year 2010. Members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) meeting in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in August, agreed to combat child trafficking and sexual exploitation, with a special emphasis on protection for girls. The conference also designated the first decade of the new century as the SAARC Decade of the Rights of the Child.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="polio"><B>Polio gets the boot</B></A><BR>

The "Kick Polio Out Of Africa" campaign was launched by South African president, Nelson Mandela on 2 August. The campaign uses soccer, which is popular throughout the continent, as a medium for polio immunisation messages. The campaign is led by the World Health Organisation and supported by UNICEF, Rotary International and the Organisation of African Unity.<BR>

Polio cases in Africa have dropped by more than 75 per cent in the past three years. While the last reported case of polio in South Africa was in 1989, more than 20 per cent of children have still not been protected through routine immunisation.<BR>

President Mandela said "No country can be safe from this disease until the whole world is rid of it."<BR>

National Immunisation Days in August in Zambia and Zimbabwe saw strong turnouts. UNICEF Zambia provided 4.2 million doses of polio vaccine and supported social mobilisation and logistics as its contribution to the programme. Such mass immunisation days are an important part of the programme to eradicate the disease as it catches children who may have been missed through routine coverage with oral polio vaccine.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="midgoals"><B>Mid-decade goals</B></A><BR>

Paraguay announced details of its national progress towards the goals for the year 2000, in August, including 90 percent immunisation coverage, a decline in the number of children dying from dehydration due to diarrhoea and 95 per cent access to the first grade of primary school. However, the report also noted a number of challenges still to be met, including iodisation of salt, universal access to safe water and reducing the numbers of children dropping out of school.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="americas"><B>Children in the Americas</B></A><BR>

Delegates from 34 countries reaffirmed their commitment to the goals of the 1990 World Summit for Children at a regional meeting in Santiago, Chile.<BR>

All countries attending adopted a Santiago Accord pledging to step up their efforts to meet the Summit goals with action on growing problems such as HIV/AIDS, child labour and early pregnancy.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="oman"><B>Progress on the Convention</B></A><BR>

Oman has almost completed the process of ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child, following agreement from the national parliament. Switzerland is also reported to be accelerating the process of ratification with the national parliament due to discuss the issue this month. Ratification by these two countries will leave just three countries who have not yet ratified.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="bfhi"><B>Baby Friendly Hospital news</B></A><BR>

Nigeria declared 128 health facilities "Baby Friendly" as part of activities to mark World Breastfeeding Week in August. Over 8,000 health facilities worldwide have been certified under the UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative which encourages hospitals to adopt the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, designed by UNICEF and WHO.<BR>

In the UK, three more hospitals - Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital in London, Rutherglen Maternity Hospital in Glasgow and the Royal Oldham Hospital - have received certificates of commitment. The hospitals must adopt a policy on breastfeeding and begin to work towards full Baby Friendly status within a year.<BR>

<h1 align=center>The Facts</h1>

<font size=4>Class divisions are about more than money and material wealth - they're
about power, ownership and control as well. As free-market capitalism spreads
wider and deeper, 
so does class division.</font><BR>
<BR><hr width=71%><p>

<h3 align=center>Ownership</h3>

<b>It's not just how much you earn, but what you <i>own</i> - the power and privilege
that ownership conveys - that matters. Wealth accumulates for the wealthy.
The disparities of ownership are even greater than those of income:</b><p>
<ul>

<li> In 1983, <i>two-thirds</i> of all individual wealth in the US was owned by the
top 10% of the population.<BR>
<li> By 1989 the richest 0.5% of US households (some 419,000 families) had
increased their share of total private wealth in the US from 24% to 29%
- they could have paid off the entire national debt in 1989 and still
have been left with about 10% more net worth than they had in 1983.<BR>
<li> Then, between 1989 and 1995, the valuation of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average of shares doubled, and with it the value of the 80% of all US financial
assets that are held by the top 10% of American households, hugely increasing
the value of their assets.</ul><p>

<center></center><br clear=all><br>


<hr width=71%><p>

<h3 align=center>Mobility</h3>

Recent and definitive academic research has revealed that a 'bedrock' of
class inequality operates similarly in all industrial societies - and
has changed little this century. So, for example, women from top 'salariat'
homes in the US are 2.98 times more likely to achieve salariat employment
(and avoid working-class jobs or unemployment) than women from working-class
backgrounds - in Russia 2.78 times. Supposedly 'open' societies like
the former West Germany or the US do not have significantly greater class
mobility than 'class-ridden' Britain. <p>

<center></center><br clear=all><br>



<hr width=71%><p>

<h3 align=center>Work</h3>

The countries of the South now account for 80 per cent of the world's 'working
class', its industrial workforce. In the North more people now work in service
industries than in factories, though in the world as a whole more people still work in agriculture
than in any other single category.<p>

<h3 align=center>The World's Worst</h3>

Every year the UN calculates a 'Human Development Index' (HDI) for all the
countries of the world, from which points are deducted for high levels of
inequality. Brazil has one of the most unequal 
distributions of income in the world, with the richest 20% of Brazilians
receiving 26 times the income of the 
bottom 20%. <p>

This results in a 16.38% reduction in its HDI score. Some industrial countries
once thought of as more 'egalitarian' than others - like Aotearoa/New
Zealand - which have implemented 'free-market' reforms, are now among
the most divided. The worst of the 53 countries for which this information
is available feature in this table.<BR clear=all>

<b>The gap between rich and poor is getting wider everywhere. But it is wider
in some areas of activity than in others. </b><p>
<ul>
<li>The richest 20% of the world's people now have a virtual monopoly of access
to commercial bank lending - an astonishing 485 times more than the
poorest 20%, who in effect have no access at all. <BR>
<li>The main reason for this is that the richest 20% own assets which they
can use as 'collateral' for loans, whereas the poorest 20% own virtually
nothing.</ul><p>

<h2>THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR WOMEN: A GUIDE TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S POSITION ON THE UN CONFERENCE ON WOMEN</h2>


<h3>What does Amnesty International want to come out of the UN Conference on Women?</h3>
 

This is the first UN Conference on Women where human rights issues are on the agenda and Amnesty International is looking for a commitment in both words and action to improve the protection of those rights. The key issues for Amnesty International are: 

<ul><li>The universality and invisibility of human rights </ul><p>


The Platform of Action, the main document that will emerge from the conference , still does not make a strong and clear statement that all women, wherever they live in the world or whatever their circumstances, should enjoy all the human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that all these rights are inextricably linked. This principle is expressed as the universality and indivisibility of human rights.<p>


It is astounding that commitments on this very point made by 171 governments just two years ago at the 1993 UN World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 are barely visible in the Platform of Action. At that conference, governments adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which states:
<ul><li>The human rights of women and the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of human rights. The human rights of women should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities, including the promotion of all human rights instrument relating to women. The World Conference on Human Rights urges Governments, institutions, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights of women and the girl-child. </ul><p>


At this stage, many governments have resisted attempts to affirm and build on the commitments to all human rights they made in Vienna, and at other global conferences on the environment, population and social development. The message many governments are sending is that they will not treat all human rights on the same footing , and in particular that they do not want to tackle human rights violations for which they have direct responsibility. <p>


<h3>Violence against women</h3>

Until the most recent draft of the Platform of Action, state violence against women, such as torture, "disappearances", and extrajudicial executions , was barely mentioned. The current draft states explicitly that governments should "refrain from engaging in violence against women" and prevent and investigate such acts and punish those responsible including state agents. <p>


What is still missing, though, is a statement that torture by state agents is one of the most common forms of violence suffered by women. For the Platform of Action to commit governments to eliminating this form of violence, it needs to include a strong exhortation for all government to ratify without any limiting reservations the Convention Against Torture and other relevant human rights instruments.<p>


It must also urge them to take prompt steps to implement the Convention including a clear statement that any state agent suspected of being responsible for torture will be brought to justice.<p>


This point is crucial not only because any attempt to stem violence against women must eradicate brutality by police and soldiers but also because any government which does not do so sends a message to others in its society that violence against women is not taken seriously. <p>


<h3>Armed Conflict</h3>

Women are disproportionately the victims of human rights violations and abuses including rape and other torture, "disappearances" and summary or arbitrary executions during armed conflicts, a central point that the conference must take on board for it to make a real impact on the human rights violations suffered by women.<p>


The conference must also recognize that both governments and armed opposition groups are bound by international humanitarian law , known as the laws of war , that prohibit rape and other forms of torture, as well as hostage taking, and extrajudicial execution. <p>


Increasingly, rape is used by soldiers as a weapon of war, and the conference should specifically condemn such torture and governments should commit themselves to eliminating rape by their forces.<p>


<h3>How do human rights issues relate to the other key points of debate at the conference? </h3>

The themes of the World Conference on Women , equality, development and peace - will not be achieved unless governments commit themselves to ensuring that women fully enjoy all human rights.<p>


The rights to equality, development and peace are inextricably linked to civil and political rights because any woman who faces arbitrary imprisonment, torture, "disappearance", judicial or extrajudicial execution stands no chance of exercising any other of her rights. <p>


The conference in Beijing will be the first opportunity for the world's governments to spell out how past commitments to the human rights of women can be implemented to achieve real and measurable change for women by the year 2000. <p>


<h3>What are the obstacles to achieving a commitment from governments on human rights protection?</h3>

The major obstacles will be governments who ignore the urgent need for action on human rights protection for women in favour of vested political interests, and those who will ignore the fact that the state is a major cause of the violations of the human rights of women. <p>


<h3>Does Amnesty International believe that the outcome of the conference will make a difference to the human rights of women? </h3>

It can make a difference if the governments at the conference build on, and do not roll back, their commitment to all human rights for women, and if they then take concrete action to promote and protect those rights when they leave Beijing and return to their countries. <p>


The real test for the success of any major UN conference is not just what is said or agreed at the conference itself, but what takes place afterwards. The three previous world conferences on women have not dealt with the human rights of women , this is long overdue and we hope the conference will finally come to grips with human rights. <p>


Amnesty International will judge the ultimate impact of the conference on whether governments ratify the various human rights instruments that are relevant to the protection of women, implement them by changing their national laws and policing, trial and other procedures, and, finally, whether human rights violations against women decrease. <p>


Whatever the Platform for Action says, and we hope that governments will use this opportunity to make firm commitments to human rights, it is ultimately what governments do that will change the situation of women.<p>

<b>

La France still considers Africa as a domaine r&#233;serv&#233; offering the

previous coloniser the grandeur of a medium-sized world power.

Despite all the eloquent speeches on the necessity of democracy in

Africa, the French still like to work with the dictators. "The

crueler the regime, the more certain it is of French support."</b>

<p>

"Tonight we will watch the results on television with a whole

group," said a West African friend who had no other alternative a

few years ago but to go into exile in the Netherlands in order to

save his own life. It was May 7 last, the day of the presidential

elections in France. "Whoever wins, this result is important for

our future" he added. His country's dictatorial regime has been

supported by the French Republic for years. The military who

ordered the people to be tortured were educated in French military

schools. French officials advise the army leaders. And while the

IMF strictly restricts funds, the budget is helped by rich uncle

France. In exchange, France has a loyal ally and it profits from

the raw materials which the government friend sells cheaply.

<p>

Each change of presidents in France stirs the hope that there will

be a change in the French African policy. Not only for the African

democrats and the opposition, but also for concerned Frenchmen.

"Monstrous" is how Fran&#231;ois-Xavier Verschave describes the French

interference in the African continent. Verschave is president of

the French organisation  "Survie", which campaigned for a healthy

and democratic African policy in the months prior to the

presidential elections together with a few other Non Governmental

Organisations (NGOs).

<p>

"Ever since we started researching these relations, we have been

stunned a few times by the reality. Each time we discovered

something aggravating, it appeared later on that the reality was

even worse than we could have expected" says Verschave.

<p>

According to Verschave, Franco-African relations are determined by

a mafia-like old-boy network in which tyranny, geo-political,

strategic and economic interests are important.

<p>

France, convinced of its superior culture during the colonial era

and with its enormous urge to civilise, never let go of Africa.

During World War II, General De Gaulle promised the African

colonies "a kind of emancipation" as a reward for their

contribution in fighting off naziism. But after the War, the highly

weakened France had trouble with the prospect of continuing without

the colonies. Besides, Paris feared the competitive influence of

the Communists and the Americans in French-speaking Africa. After

all, they reasoned, this area belongs to France anyway, considering

its geographic proximity and the historical ties. When

decolonisation was to take place, Paris and the colonies made a few

cooperation agreements for defence, foreign policy, and economic

and monetary affairs. The interests of both parties were

safeguarded through the coop&#233;ration. For example, in 1960, when the

Cameroon government was pressured due to an uprising in the south,

Elys&#233;e was quick to respond. French troops dealt quickly with the

uprising. Many villages were burned down and wiped off the map.

When the revolt's leader was later poisoned in Geneva by the French

secret service, the revolt again broke out. President Ahidjo,

supported by French advisers, ordered the attack. In two years,

between 300,000 and 400,000 people were slaughtered. Throughout all

of it, France supported the Cameroon government which carried out

a reign of terror.

<p>

Le gendarme often interfered in order to control African  history.

At will, African leaders are installed or removed. There have been

thirty French military interferences since 1963. Even today there

are more than fifty thousand French military on the continent. 

<p>

The French government has a remarkable preference for dictatorial

regimes in its choice of allies (Zaire, Gabon, Togo, Rwanda, Chad,

the Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic etc.).

<p>

"In general, the French are convinced that Africa can only function

if a strong government has the power. Africa is supposed to have

strong regimes, and as a rule this signifies dictatorial regimesþ

is how Sorel Keita puts it, a journalist and secretary of the

African Journalist Association in France. Verschave shares this

opinion: "The crueler the regime, the more certain it is of French

support."

<p>

French presidents attach great interest to their domaine r&#233;serv&#233;

which offers them the prestige of being the leader of an empire.

General De Gaulle was permanently informed by Jacques Foccart, who

was specially responsible for the African policy. After the

general's departure, the central decision-making was dispersed and

various groups of interests had free play. "Under Giscard d'Estaing

the clientelism developed into a family-like network in which

cousins and friends of Giscard became involved in various trade

transactions with Africa" according to Verschave. Giscard d'Estaing

also wanted his friendship with African leaders to be proved with

gifts such as diamonds.

<p>

The Franco-African family extended itself even more in the

socialist government of president Fran&#231;ois Mitterand. His son Jean

Christophe nicknamed, "Papamadi" (father told me) favoured the

African continent. One year after his father's election, Mitterand

started working for the cellule africaine, the Department of

African Affairs which is directly under the president's

responsibility, and he soon climbed to the top. "There is not one

African dictator's son with which Jean-Christophe is not

permanently in contact with", says Verschave. Some of his intimates

include Ali Bongo (Gabon), Jean-Pierre Habyarimana (Rwanda), Manda

Mobutu (Zaire). In 1992 Jean-Christophe, who became head of the

cellule after the forced departure of Guy Penne, had to leave it

due to a number of affairs, including the disappearance of 195

million francs which were intended as a guarantee for the storage

of cacao in the Ivory Coast.

<p>

According to Verschave, Jean-Christophe Mitterand is not the only

one with a preference for the continent. He estimates that there

are about 15 active networks surrounding people such as Charles

Pasqua (ex-Minister of the Interior) and Jacques Foccart (adviser

to De Gaulle and now once more for Jacques Chirac). Next to that

there are lobbies of companies such as oil multinational Elf, the

army and three secret services. "These networks all are securing

their own interests varying from geo-strategic and simply

commercial interests to trade in precious stones, drugs or weapons

and laundering black money" says Verschave. "Franco-African

relations are showing more and more mafia-like characteristics."

<p>

One of the most recent scandals is the French action in Rwanda.

"The Rwandese president, Juvenal Habyarimana", says Verschave, "was

a great seducer. He knew how to take Mitterand in completely." And

while Rwanda more and more became a fascist state in the past few

years, France decided to reward Habyarimana for his loyalty.

Starting in 1990, France sent airplanes, light tanks, helicopters,

munition, missiles. French instructors trained the army and Hutu

militia. And France also offered to finance the military purchases

in South Africa and Egypt.

<p>

When the Front Patriotique Rwandais (FPR), the Tutsi liberation

front, started a large offensive in the north of Rwanda in October

1990, president Habyarimana directly called Jean-Christophe

Mitterand requesting he send military. Mitterand directly

responded. In a little while, French military were helping the

Rwandese army in beating off the attack of the Khmers noirs, as the

Tutsi rebels are called. And France kept on sending military. In

1991 a judicial inspection mission discovered that French officials

participated in questioning FPR prisoners and that their barracks

were at Kigali prison, where torturing took place.

<p>

When Rwanda became a hell after president Habyarimana's death due

to Hutu extremists massive slaughter of Tutsis and moderate Hutus,

France befriended members of the Hutu power. On April 9,

Habyarimana's widow, one of the founders of the infamous radio

Mille Collines, was evacuated. She was received with flowers and

200,000 francs developmental funds upon her arrival in order to be

able to settle down. Other Hutu extremists also were able to come

to France. The French ambassador in Rwanda decided to burn his

archives. Then president Mitterand announced the "Op&#233;ration

Turquoise" under the guise of a humanitarian operation. The "safe

zone" in the southwest of Rwanda which was created by the French,

was an escape route for those guilty of genocide. And France also

was able to prevent that the new FPR regime received international

aid from the European Union and the World Bank until 25 November.

<p>

The question remains why France was so interested in the

poverty-stricken Rwanda. "Mitterand's son was involved in various

affairs in Rwanda, such as probably drugs trade and perhaps other

things. There was a considerable weapon trade in the region" says

Verschave. Gustave Massiah 1, of the Centre d'Etudes et

d'Initiatives de Solidarit&#233; Internationale, suggests that the

Habyarimana regime was covering the provision of nuclear technology

to South Africa in the time that there was an embargo against

Pretoria.

<p>

It is a fact that France's paranoia of the Anglo-Saxon block in the

region was an important factor for supporting Habyarimana. "The

Americans showed interest in (the Ugandan president) Museveni, who

in turn, supported FPR. As of then Museveni is an enemy who should

be resisted and therefore the Francophone Habyarimana is turned toþ

according to Verschave.

<p>

The same fear caused Paris (with the Minister of the Interior of

that time Charles Pasqua) to tighten the bonds with the Sudanese

regime. In Sudan a civil war between Arabic-islamic Khartoum and

the black liberation front in the south had been going on for years

which was supported by the United States. "France is prepared to

support the massacres in Sudan, arguing that the Americans are

helping the other party" explains Verschave.

<p>

In 1993-1994 the Sudanese secret service was invited to France four

times for a working visit. The espionage service was given

communication instruments and bugging devices. "France helped

reorganise the Sudan gestapo. Satellite photographs were handed out

so that the Sudan population in the south could be bombarded.

Genocide is taking place in the south of Sudan and France is

quietly taking part", says an outraged Verschave. In exchange for

France's service, Charles Pasqua was able to arrange Sudan's

extradition of the terrorist Carlos in August 1994. And with this,

Pasqua was able to boost his badly damaged image in France.

<p>

France's interference in Africa is not only

psychologically-strategically motivated. "Africa has been and still

is an economic partner for France as supplier of raw materials, as

a market for its products and capital investments and as support of

its monetary unit" writes Guy Martin 2, professor at Clark Atlanta

University of Georgia. To a large extent, France depends on the

minerals in Africa. In this sense, France depends 100 per cent on Gabon and

Niger for uranium. Ninety per cent of its bauxite is from Guinea.

Fifty-seven per cent of France's copper comes from Zaire and Zambia. And

about 31 per cent of the iron ore comes from Liberia and Mauritania. "It is

remarkable that the French balance of trade, which shows a chronic

shortage with the rest of the world, always has been positive with

Africa" declares Martin. After a regression, the French export to

Africa has stabilised or even increased to 82 million francs since

1988. After Europe and North America, Africa is the third export

market for France.

<p>

The French Connection also has another lubricant: developmental

funds. French president Mitterand's warning in 1990 during the

Franco-African summit in La Baule that development aid would become

independent of the democratisation process had little effect.

According to Martin, the developmental aid to countries in

transition, such as Benin, Mali and Niger, diminished while aid to

authoritarian regimes such as Cameroon, Togo and Zaire increased.

<p>

Pascal Krop 3 explains where the development funds are directed to.

He estimates that for each 100 francs of development aid, 25 to 30 per cent

goes directly to the African leaders. They then channel part of the

funds to the French political parties. About 12 per cent of French aid is

spent as salaries of French development employees. Between 55 and

60 per cent is regulated aid and must be spent in France. Krop concludes

that in the end merely 3 per cent is spent on the population's well-being.

Besides, 80 per cent of the aid is never evaluated.

<p>

Verschave also has facts on the "development mafia." He explains

that part of the developmental aid is hors projet, intended to

support the structural adjustment programmes. "That money is

intended to gloss over the embezzlement of state funds" according

to Verschave. "Take Cameroon, for example. The income from the oil

exploitation goes directly to president Biya. The state treasury

has a systematic deficit because the countries riches go directly

to private bank accounts. For years France has helped fill the gaps

in the Cameroon budget.

<p>

Besides that, there is l'aide aux projets. These projects can be

almost anything, says Verschave. "It can be a presidential palace,

an ultra modern hospital which never will be used, an inaccessible

university or a motorway which can only by used by the presidential

palace. This money is the biggest possible donation for governments

who owe no one anything."

<p>

Verschave claims that the position of the NGO's is extremely

limited. Merely 0.7 per cent of France's development aid is done through

NGOs. "We have campaigned for allowing NGOs to deal with

one-seventh of the development aid. In 1989 72 per cent of Parliament

signed a bill to achieve this. But the initiative never followed

through", says Verschave.

<p>

Despite the growing criticism of the French policy, nothing is done

within government circles. "I am very pessimistic about the

opportunities for France with Chirac," says Sorel Keita. A change

will most probably be an African initiative. Verschave points out

that in countries such as Zaire and Cameroon, an increasing

"Francophobia" is taking place. Keita indicates that in cities such

as Abidjan, young people are openly protesting against the wrongs. 

"It is a spontaneous revolt of young people who have nothing to

lose due to the economic crisis" he says.  For many youngsters,

people like Burkina ex-president Thomas Sankara, who paid with his

life for resisting the former mafia system, have become heroes.

<H3>Oxfam briefing to the UN Security Council and the Bureaux of ECOSOC, the Second, and the Third Committees on the Great Lakes region</H3>

<H4>12 February 1997<BR>
David Bryer, Oxfam
</H4>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>This unprecedented briefing by NGOs is a welcome opportunity for us to raise those issues that are of concern to us and that affect our work with the people of the Great Lakes region and beyond. For Oxfam, meeting the needs of the regions people presents almost daily dilemmas  - in short, the challenges of working in turbulence. This turbulence is now extending beyond what we have come to accept as the Great Lakes region. Whilst Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire continue to form the centre of the region, our experience increasingly shows that the consequences of conflict in the Great Lakes are stretching far beyond. The dimensions of the crisis in the Great Lakes demand a concerted international response, beyond the remit of NGOs to provide. We appeal to all UN member states to act where humanitarian agencies cannot.

<H3>Humanitarian needs in the region</H3>
<P>The absence of protection: The scale of needs in the region are vast - whether people are genocide survivors, refugees, displaced, refugee affected, or destitute in their homes. Meeting peoples humanitarian needs has three aspects - protection, assistance and access. In the Great Lakes, where our work is set in a context of war and violence, all three aspects are compromised. The Geneva Conventions enshrine principles for the protection of civilians in conflict, yet these principles are systematically ignored. The protection afforded to refugees under the Refugee Conventions has been eroded by the failure to apply the conventions exclusion clauses undermining the claims of bona fide refugees. Many people in Eastern Zaire may yet pay with their lives for the international failure to separate genocidaires from bona fide refugees. The absence of protection is a frequent feature of the lives of those who Oxfam seeks to assist. 

<P>The lack of  access: Meeting humanitarian needs inevitably demands that we are able to assist people adequately. This requires that we have sufficient and appropriate resources to address those problems that we face. Critically in the Great Lakes, meeting needs also requires access to those in need of assistance. Access is increasingly under threat. Belligerents throughout the region frequently do not recognise either the right of civilians to humanitarian assistance, nor the impartiality of agencies seeking to assist them. This is a source of great frustration and concern to us. Our lack of access also, inevitably, impedes our ability to brief adequately on the needs in the region. Without access we have only partial information on the precise scale of the needs throughout the region. Furthermore, where access is most difficult is likely to be where needs are most acute. 

<H3>The widening regional crisis and the need for a regional approach</H3>
<P>The fortunes of the Great Lakes countries are critically interlocked. That the devastating repercussions of conflict and genocide have reached across borders is perhaps familiar to us. Less familiar, but increasingly apparent in Oxfams work, is the widening extent of this destabilisation and threat to livelihoods. For example, the counter-offensive in Zaire has caused Sudanese refugees in Zaire to return to Sudan where Oxfam, among others, is attempting to assist them. Conflict is also intensifying in Northern Uganda, exacerbated by the war in Zaire and displacing yet more people who we are seeking to assist. We are witnessing the crystallisation of new alignments and the linking up of conflict in the Great Lakes with other conflicts across Africa. Addressing the causes of these conflicts  requires concerted international political action far beyond the remit of NGOs. The consequences of the failure to engage politically, diplomatically and economically with this region is potentially wider war in Africa.
<H3>The role of the UN Security Council and UN member states</H3>
<P>The consequences of the policy vacuum: The Joint Evaluation of the Rwanda Emergency published nearly one year ago described the international response to crisis in the Great Lakes as being characterised by a policy vacuum. Having failed to prevent or halt the genocide, despite all the warning signs, the international communitys sole response to the aftermath of genocide was to launch a vast relief effort. Humanitarian action was used as a substitute for political action. This policy vacuum continues. 

<P>The people of the Great Lakes are the victims of this vacuum. The work of NGOs is directly affected. By relying on NGOs to be substitutes for foreign policy, the great powers have reinforced or created perceptions that NGOs are instruments of foreign policy, the agents of foreign governmental intervention. Increasingly this results in refusal of access for NGOs to people requiring assistance, tightening control over NGO activity, the expulsion of NGOs , and even assassination. The absence of an adequate international response compromises NGOs abilities and attempts to respond to the needs of the regions people.

<H3>Oxfam appeals to the UN Security Council and UN member states for the following:</H3>
<ul>
<li>Reinvigorate your commitment to upholding the Great conventions, namely the Genocide convention, the Geneva conventions and the Refugee conventions
<li>For example, although genocide was not halted in Rwanda, it must now be punished and prevented. The rights of civilians in conflict must be protected. The exclusion clauses of the refugee conventions must be applied if the right to refugee status for those entitled to it is not to be permanently undermined.
<LI>Devise co-ordinated, coherent strategies for the region integrating the political,    economic, military and humanitarian dimensions
Any durable solution for the Great Lakes region requires action on a number of levels, both in the immediate, medium and longer term. The UNSC has several instruments at its disposal to ensure this including the Departments of Political Affairs and Peace Keeping, and the authority to ensure coherence and coordination of humanitarian responses.

<LI>Adopt a sustained regional approach that addresses underlying causes  - poverty, the politics of exclusion and the denial of basic rights
<P>All too often  we have witnessed partial measures to address the crisis in the Great Lakes. The enormity of recent horrors have tended to eclipse the fact that crises in the region stem from underlying causes that are both long established and complex. The UNSC and UN member states have yet to demonstrate their commitment to a response commensurate with the scale of suffering in this region. Any solution must of course come from the region itself. Without the will of the regional governments and powers to seek peace and prosperity of their people, international efforts will prove ineffective. However, to address the causes of conflict in this region requires sustained international efforts as part of a co-ordinated regional approach to complement national efforts. A regional conference could play a role in such a process. However such a conference could not itself, as a one off event, constitute a durable solution, even with serious preparatory work, and concrete measures of international support. Durable solutions  require work at all levels, as a process over the coming years. Our goal must surely be a lasting settlement in the region. This requires sustained, concerted  international action, including financial and logistical support for Ambassador Sahnoun. We need at least the same level of commitment to central Africa as we saw in the formerYugoslavia.

<P>The Great Lakes crisis remains Oxfams institutional priority. Given the scale of what we are already experiencing and its potential to worsen, we urge you to make it yours.

<TABLE BORDER=0 width=100% cellspacing=3>
<TR>
<TD valign=top width=45%>Long ago, before you or I were born, snakes used to have many legs but
no eyes. And the millipede used to have eyes but no legs. These creatures
lived together as a family.<BR>
<BR>
One day there was a festival in the village and all the animals were invited.
The elder millipede and the elder snake were also invited. They were both
delighted to attend.<BR>
<BR>
The snake asked his friend the millipede,<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Will you lend me your eyes so that for once I can see all the fun
of the festival? In return I will lend you my legs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The millipede, who felt sorry for the snake because he could not see, agreed
that he would lend him his eyes while they went to the festival. He gave
his eyes to the snake and in return the snake gave the millipede his legs.<BR>
<BR></TD>
<td valign=top width=55%>
They set off to the festival with the snake leading the way because he could
see. <BR>
<br>
The snake was very happy. For the first time he could see all the animals
and their colourful coats. The millipede was not so happy because  he could
not see the other creatures and the events of the festival, although he
could hear the drumming.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the festival the snake and millipede went home together with
the snake again leading the way. But when they got home the snake refused
to give the millipede back his eyes. When the millipede went near the snake
the snake quickly slid away and disappeared into the forest.<BR>
<BR>
The millipede is still looking for the snake so he can recover his eyes,
but he hasn't yet found him. And that is why the snake has eyes and no legs
and the millipede has hundreds of legs but no eyes.<BR>

THE BASIC PHYSICS: Energy can be neither produced nor destroyed, but can
only be converted from one form to another. This is known as the FIRST LAW
OF THERMODYNAMICS.<BR>
With every conversion of energy from one form into another, <BR>
conversion losses occur. Because of these losses, heat and other emissions
are released that bring disorder or entropy. <BR>
This is known as the SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS.</b></center><BR>

The world currently relies on fossil fuels for most of its energy<br>

<b><font size=4 color=#006600>FOSSIL FIXATION</b></font>
<BR>

Fossil fuels - oil, coal and gas - currently provide the world
with most of its energy. But burning these fuels is the primary source of
carbon dioxide emissions, the main cause of global warming. <BR>
At this rate the global temperature is set to rise 3-4 <sup>o</sup>C by 2100, causing
a rise in sea levels of 66 cms and the disruption of the world's climate.
The low-lying Maldive islands, in the Indian Ocean, would disappear entirely.<sup>5</sup><BR>
<BR>
In 1992, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that a
cut of 60-80% in human-generated emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is needed
to stabilize the world's climate.<sup>4</sup><BR clear=all>

<BR>
THE COST OF DIFFERENT ENERGY SYSTEMS IS SKEWED IN FAVOUR OF FOSSIL FUELS

One of the arguments against renewable energies is that they are uneconomic.
But this is wearing thin as the price of electricity generated from renewable
sources comes down and the technology becomes more efficient. <BR>
<BR>
<li> In 1995 the cost of electricity generated from gas and coal was 3-4 cents
per kilowatt hour, from nuclear was 10-14 cents, from wind was 5-7 cents,
and from solar photovoltaic was 25-40 cents.<BR>

<li> Biomass: More than 50 Third World countries would be able to produce as
much energy from the residues generated by sugar production as they use
now via imported oil.<sup>9</sup><BR>

A Kanga is the traditional clothing of Tanzanian and Kenyan women. It consists
of two rectangles of cotton exactly the same - called a 'doti'. Printed
in bold designs and bright colours with a border all around it, it is 150
cm long and 110 cm wide, wide enough to cover a grown woman from neck to
knee or from breast to toe.<BR>
<BR>
Make your own Kanga from one or two lengths of cotton sheeting - you may
want to scale the size down if you are not yet full grown. Make your own
design, Kanga designs are usually only three or four colours maximum, sometimes
just two. Batik, tie-die, screen printing, fabric crayons could be used
to make your design. Then try wearing your Kanga in the styles shown here.
Kangas are always worn over a petticoat or dress.<BR>

EU Council of Development Ministers<br>

Statement issued following the Special Meeting of European Union Development and Humanitarian Aid Ministers, Brussels, 7 November 1996</h2>

Source: <A HREF="../../liaison/index.html">Liaison Comittee of Development NGO's to the European Union</A></h4></center>

<p>

<hr>

<p>

1.	A special meeting of European Union development and humanitarian aid

Ministers was held in Brussels on 7 November 1996 to examine recent

developments in the Great Lakes Region and to discuss the humanitarian

situation of refugees and displaced people in eastern Zaire and ways and

means to bring about an easing of the humanitarian crisis and an enhancement

of the prospects for a sustainable solution.  The meeting was chaired by the

Minister of State, Joan Burton T.D. of Ireland and was attended by

development and humanitarian aid Ministers or representatives from all EU

Member States.  The Commission was represented by Mrs Emma Bonino and Prof J

. Pinheiro.

<P>

2.	Commissioner Pinheiro made a short general statement on the situation

facing the Great Lakes Region and Commissioner  Bonino briefed Ministers on

the humanitarian response of the Commission to the crisis to date and

presented a plan of action, which will be examined immediately and in more

detail in the competent committee on humanitarian aid. Commissioner Bonino

emphasised the urgency of immediate intervention to alleviate the suffering

of refugees and displaced people and presented ideas concerning future

action.  The EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr Ajello, briefed

the meeting on the current complex political situation in the region.  Mr

Akashi, Under-Secretary of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), Mrs

. Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs  Bellamy, Director of UNICEF

, Mr Graisse, Assistant Executive Director of World Food Programme and Mr De

Courtin, Director of Operations for the International Committee of the Red

Cross also gave briefings on the evolving humanitarian situation in the

region.

<P>

3.	The meeting reaffirmed the Union's deep concern at the deteriorating

situation in Eastern Zaire and the threat posed to peace and stability in

the entire Great Lakes Region. The meeting reaffirmed the Union's

determination and commitment to do everything in its power to help and to

assist immediately vulnerable people, refugees and displaced persons in

Eastern Zaire, in averting further human tragedy there and in avoiding a

potentially catastrophic humanitarian disaster in the region.  The meeting

also reiterated the view of the Union that the complex problems at issue can

only be resolved through early and substantive dialogue and called again on

all parties concerned, including in particular Zaire and Rwanda, to begin

such a process as soon as possible. The meeting acknowledged the strong

interconnection between the immediate humanitarian requirements and the

broader political issues underlying the conflict and the need to address

them in a comprehensive way.

<P>

4.	In this regard, the meeting expressed full support for the efforts of the

United Nations, regional leaders and the Organisation of African Unity to

facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the conflict and

reaffirmed the Union's commitment to assist in every way possible.  It

welcomed the outcome of the Nairobi Summit of Heads of State of the region

on 5 November.  The meeting endorsed the call by the Heads of State in their

Press Statement for an immediate ceasefire which should be strictly observed

to enable the intensification of diplomatic efforts to achieve lasting peace

.  The meeting shared the view expressed by the Regional Heads of State 

concerning the importance of the territorial integrity of Zaire, in

accordance with the OAU Charter and, in particular, the Cairo Declaration of

1964,  an end to cross-border incursions and  the inalienable rights of all

people, including those of citizenship and nationality. The meeting welcomed

the call by the Heads of State for the immediate setting up of safe

corridors and temporary sanctuaries inside Zaire to facilitate humanitarian

assistance and the repatriation of refugees and noted their request in this

regard to the Security Council for the deployment of a "neutral force".  The

meeting also welcomed the call by the Heads of State for the intensification

of efforts towards voluntary repatriation of refugees to Rwanda and the

"implementation of the long-standing decision to separate the intimidators

and bona fide refugees". The meeting also underlined the importance of

support for the democratic process in Zaire.

<P>

5.	The meeting noted that special arrangements were urgently required in the

short term to ensure a stable security situation in Eastern Zaire, to

facilitate both the necessary humanitarian tasks and the process of dialogue

.  It noted that efforts to this end were being pursued by the Security

Council, taking into account recent proposals which have been made. The

French and Spanish Ministers briefed the meeting on their proposal in this

regard for a temporary force for strictly humanitarian purposes in order to

enable the delivery of aid to the populations concerned.

<P>

6.	In this context, the meeting recalled the Conclusions of the European

Council in Florence on 21-22 June 1996 which indicated that the Council

"continues to support the convening of an international conference under the

joint auspices of the UN and the Organisation of African Unity in order to

address within a global approach the root causes of the crises and to ensure

respect for commitments".

<P>

7.	The meeting expressed its warm appreciation of the efforts of the EU

Special Envoy in seeking, on behalf of the EU, to facilitate a peaceful

resolution of the conflict and the addressing of the immediate humanitarian

requirements and welcomed the fact that Mr Ajello would be continuing his

work in the region in that regard. It looked forward to close coordination

between him and the newly appointed Special Envoy of the Secretary General

of the United Nations, Ambassador Raymond Chr&#233;tien.

<P>

8.	The meeting agreed to send immediately a special mission of development

Ministers from Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy together with Commissioner

Bonino to make an assessment of the humanitarian situation and to identify

ways and means to speed up humanitarian assistance. The EU Special Envoy

will also participate in the mission. The conclusions of this mission will

be transmitted urgently to the General Affairs Council.

<P>

9.	The meeting recalled the Union's commitment to promote the voluntary

return of refugees to their countries of origin. It strongly underlined the

need to ensure safe and protected humanitarian corridors in order to

facilitate the delivery of immediate relief supplies to the victims of the

crisis where they are, as well as the voluntary safe and dignified return of

 refugees to their countries of origin. The need for support for development

efforts as well as for strengthening the legal system notably within Rwanda

to facilitate the integration of returned refugees was also noted.

<P>

10.	The meeting agreed on the need to work in a coordinated manner with

international humanitarian agencies and NGOs to ensure an effective

humanitarian response to the crisis and underlined the coordinating role of

the DHA in the UN system.  It noted the resource needs of the humanitarian

agencies and agreed on the importance of ensuring that aid resources are

made available for agreed priorities as a matter of urgency. The meeting

called on all parties in the region to ensure the safety and freedom of

movement of all international humanitarian aid personnel.

<P>

11.	Since the beginning of the crisis in the Great Lakes Region in 1994, the

European Community and its Member States have provided in the order of 755

MECU in humanitarian aid. At the meeting, the humanitarian agencies

indicated  that they will be shortly in a position to approach the Community

and the Member States regarding precise requirements and needs.  It was

agreed that the most urgent consideration will be given to these appeals.  

<P>

12.	Ministers emphasised that the scale of the current humanitarian crisis

in the Great Lakes Region calls for a coherent and concerted international

response.  It was reaffirmed  that the Union will play its full part in this

task.

<h5>OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE BRIEFING PAPER FEBRUARY 1994</h5>
<h3>POLITICAL LIBERALISATION AND ECONOMIC REFORM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</h3>
<p>
<i>The last decade has seen unprecedented moves towards more liberal and democratic forms of political rule across the developing world. There have been expectations, in Africa and elsewhere, that such political changes would have a positive influence on economic reform measures. This Briefing Paper first describes the nature of the reforms and the links between political systems and economic management. It then examines some recent evidence of economic reform under new, and more democratic, political regimes in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.</i>
<hr>
<h3>The Nature of Reforms</h3>
The current process of <i>political liberalisation</i> has been characterised by a series of reforms which involve greater respect for individual and collective rights, greater freedom of association and expression, amnesties for political prisoners and the institution of new constitutional changes such as the replacement of single-party by multi- party systems and the introduction of regular, free and fair elections for political succession. Democracy has been held to be consolidated when the new 'political rules' are generally recognised and become habitual, when elected assemblies have more than token power vis-a-vis the political executive and there is civil control over the military. 
<p>
A number of Latin American countries have progressed beyond the process of political liberalisation which began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and appear to be in the period of 'democratic consolidation'. Several East Asian countries are in the political liberalisation phase. In sub-Saharan Africa, since 1989, there has been some political liberalisation following initial popular protests. Typically, these began with largely urban interest groups - unions, business people, students - seeking to improve their specific conditions but also protesting against government corruption, repression and mismanagement. The degree of political liberalisation has varied widely and, in Africa especially, it is premature to talk of the consolidation of democratic rules or norms. 
<p>
<i>Economic reform </i>(or economic adjustment) can be broken down into those policies which effectively achieve macro-economic stabilisation through the use of rigorous fiscal and monetary policy, and those moves towards market liberalisation which involve more freely functioning markets for foreign exchange, credit and labour; reduced government intervention and regulation of marketing and pricing of traded products; the dismantling of state foreign- exchange management and import restrictions; and the introduction of more commercial principles into the management of public enterprises. There is near consensus that control of fiscal deficits and inflation is essential for the proper functioning of markets, though there are differences of view on the appropriate sequencing of some of the above reforms.
<p>
While domestic forces have been major influences on the rate of both political and economic reform in developing countries in the 1980s, the global movement towards greater freedom from the arbitrary power of the state, and external financial pressures, have also played a powerful role. In Latin America a major influence was the drying up of access to international finance after 1982; in sub-Saharan Africa donor pressure for economic and political reform was a key factor. In the 1990s the aid agencies are setting conditions for both political and economic reform before releasing programme aid to many poor recipient countries, mainly but not entirely, in sub-Saharan Africa.<link to> (See <a href="odi_pol_donors.html">DONORS AND THEIR CRITICS</a>)
<p>
<h3>Political Systems and Economic Performance</h3><br>
 Until the mid-1980s there was a widespread belief that tough authoritarian government was good for economic performance and adjustment programmes. This view was based on particular experiences of reform following military coups (eg Brazil 1964, Chile 1973, Argentina 1976, South Korea 1961, 1980, Ghana 1983).
<p>
This view is now less widespread, despite successful authoritarian economic management in, for example, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. However, authoritarian governance has depended on the specific nature and quality of the political leadership as well as reliance on patronage systems for survival. There have been explanations of why authoritarian regimes take a short-term perspective and seek personal gains from state- protected and subsidised activities. In contrast, some authoritarian leaders have taken a longer view and have promoted policies of economic stabilisation and effective industrialisation and development, with bureaucracies competent to implement the strategy.
<p>
More systematic research has now been done on the economic performance of different types of political regime in the developing countries. This fails to show that more authoritarian regimes are better at controlling their public expenditure, budget deficits, credit ceilings or inflation. Nor does it show that economic growth has been greater under such regimes.
<p>
The economic reform credentials of democratic rule have similarly not been established. Nearly a hundred World Bank structural adjustment programmes were recently examined to discover the degree of initiative and commitment evidenced by the domestic political leaders and officials. No systematic connection was found with the type of political system or regime: a high level of commitment was demonstrated in some politically liberal countries (eg Costa Rica, Mauritius), but it was paralleled in some less liberal ones (eg Korea, Ghana). 
<p>
<h3>Why Link Democratisation to Economic Reform?</h3><br>
 Given this unsurprising evidence of the lack of a clear link between economic performance and type of government, why have donors and some developing country governments argued for the need to link political democratisation to economic reform programmes? One reason is the current attachment to the idea of an affinity between 'democratic' and 'market' systems. It is argued, for example, that 'markets require democracy' to limit arbitrary political intervention in individual decision- making and to protect property rights and freedom of contracts.
<p>
The prospect of simultaneously combining political liberalisation with economic reform is problematical but the following arguments are put forward to support it.
<p>
<ul><li>New governments with commitments to a fresh economic agenda can be fairly elected and can gain some trust and legitimacy from the public. The new political coalitions can include representatives of those interests - business, intellectual, religious, labour unions - which genuinely want a change in the way the economy is managed. 
<p>
<li>A new democratic government can more easily enlist support for wide-ranging reforms if the political change occurred because of failures in economic policy associated with the previous regime.
<p>
<li>Such governments can blame their predecessors for their difficult inheritance and hence win some patience from the public in their adjustment effort.
<p>
<li>The freer association and expression accorded to a range of newer civic groups (or old ones freed from state dependence) can be influential in lobbying for economic reforms. Rural constituencies and small farmers are often seen as particularly important because, as domestic food and export crop producers, they should support, and benefit from, reforms in the marketing and pricing systems. 
<p>
<li>A more open and consultative style of government should ensure economic and institutional changes worked out by compromise and consensus politics. It is recognised, however, that in times of simultaneous political and economic change some tensions are inevitable, for the following reasons. 
<p>
<li>Both processes involve 'new rules' that raise great uncertainties about how they will work - for politicians, interest groups, producers, workers, consumers, etc.
<p>
<li>With new and perhaps excessive expectations and demands from previously frustrated groups, it may be difficult to control budget spending and deficits and to ensure a more productive use of public funds.
<p>
<li>Politicians and bureaucrats are often inexperienced in their new political roles. They have to reconcile the 'insulation' of policy in order to achieve stabilisation and inflation control with the novel openness and responsiveness of more politically liberalised politics. This also requires them to resolve the conflicts of interest between newly articulate civic interest groups.
<p>
<li>Urban groups, which are often a major force in political liberalisation may well lose jobs and protected markets and face an increase in their cost of living from economic policy changes. 
</ul><p>
These are the main considerations which appear to influence the outcome of simultaneous efforts at democratisation and economic reform. How, in practice, are the tensions being resolved? We look first at middle-income 'new democracy' countries, particularly in Latin America, and then consider sub-Saharan Africa where the problems of economic reform seem most intractable.
<p>
<h3>Latin America and other Middle-Income New Democracies</h3>
<b>Economic Stabilisation</b><br>
In the middle-income countries, to date at least, the transition from authoritarian to democratic regimes has been associated with considerable macroeconomic instability. The transitions have tended to increase budget deficits and inflation though this has often been a legacy of the outgoing regime's desperate attempts to survive unpopularity through expansionist policies (Argentina 1983, Brazil 1985 and Poland more recently). But with very high inherited levels of inflation, incoming new democratic governments, in particular, have found it difficult to bring monetary policy under control, compared with established democracies. 
<p>
In the first place, democratisation has heightened popular expectations and released hitherto suppressed social demands and grievances. These have sometimes coincided with misjudgments on the part of inexperienced and insecure newly elected politicians. Populist governments have emerged and typically this has generated a sudden expansion of public spending on the creation of jobs (eg Brazil, 1984-9). Nevertheless, in general, neither in election years nor in the years before or after elections, have there been larger fiscal deficits or higher inflation, perhaps because voters in these countries are not so obviously duped as is sometimes thought.
<p>
Secondly, when a country passes a certain 'threshold of crisis', public expectations about what the state can do seem to fall. Politicians become more experienced but also more aware that they will be held 'accountable' for the results of their stewardship. Hence they become more cautious and more realistic; they gain in authority and credibility by promising less than before (eg Menem in Argentina and Salinas in Mexico).
<p>
Where there have been 'democratic pacts' providing guarantees to the property-owning classes, it has been relatively easier to maintain control of inflation in the initial democratic period, although the situation tended to relax in the subsequent period when there is more political competition. On the other hand, when the transition to democracy has led to a temporary relaxation and the collapse of inflation control, it has then been followed by drastic 'shock treatment' to stabilise the economy. Both processes have placed a strain on economic adjustment and the consolidation of democracy (eg Argentina and Bolivia in 1982). 
<p>
Thirdly, the margin for manoeuvre of the newly democratic governments been constrained by the legacy of their predecessor authoritarian regimes; the military (eg Turkey); influential business groups with ties to the old regime (eg Chile), and continuity of personnel (eg South Korea). Yet, from a longer-term viewpoint, wider public participation in policy-making, which goes beyond narrow democratic pacts, in Latin America especially, may fail to generate a wider 'social consensus' on either neo-liberal economic doctrines or on the priority for price stability as against the reduction of gross inequalities and the perceived obstacles to development.
<p>
<b>Market Liberalisation</b><br>
There is growing evidence, in Latin America and the Caribbean, of far-reaching external trade policy reforms (reduced and harmonised tariffs and QRs, export incentives, etc) which have accompanied or have been preceded by significant real exchange- rate depreciation often leading to macro-economic stabilisation. So far these have suffered no major reversals and the incoming democratic regimes in many countries have adopted the trade policy reforms despite serious political opposition. This evidence is inconsistent with concerns that democratic leaders are particularly vulnerable to powerful interest groups.
<p>
By contrast there has been much less progress in the domestic liberalisation of industrial activities; in other words reducing regulations that distort domestic product and labour markets. This situation may arise from sensitivity towards those interests which stand to lose from such changes during a political transition.
<p>
There has been slow and fairly limited reform of public enterprises driven by the pressures to cut the fiscal deficit. The threat of job lay-offs resulting from public sector reform has often met with strong opposition from organised labour. Yet in some cases public enterprise reform, managed by technocrats insulated from the political arena and receiving support from heads of state, has been partially effective. It may be reconcilable with the transition to greater democracy where the public has been apathetic and interest groups poorly organised, so the specific changes have not become the sparking-plug for opposition on the part of entrenched coalitional interests (eg India, Turkey and Mexico). There has been considerable privatisation in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is not obviously incompatible with political liberalisation provided that it is carried out in an open and transparent way - which has not always been the case - and does not arouse too much popular sensitivity about the underpricing of assets as a 'give-away' to favoured buyers.
<p>
 Much economic reform has been initiated by governments under pressure from the conditions imposed by external financiers, rather than from civic interests and pressures within their own societies. Yet changes in economic policy changes can themselves have both a positive and a negative influence on the degree of participation by the public. This is illustrated by the situation in Jamaica where the introduction of a floating exchange rate made private business groups immediately aware of any relaxation in the government's control of public expenditure and inflation and caused them to press for more effective state budgetary control. At the same time, the undoubtedly unpopular ceilings set for budget deficits, encouraged less than transparent handling of public finances which made it very difficult for the public to know what was happening.
<p>
<h3>Sub-Saharan Africa</h3>
In sub-Saharan Africa, the movement towards political liberalisation largely dates from 1989. Constitutional changes have led to multi-party elections in Ghana, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Mauritania, Kenya and Nigeria, although most of these have been marred by controversy. Countries with more genuine political liberalisation and freer elections include Cape Verde, Mali, Sao Tome and Principe, Congo, Madagascar and Zambia, apart from more durable democracies like Botswana, Gambia and Mauritius. In Zimbabwe there has been greater openness and consultation with a wide range of independent interest groups. Regimes in some countries have continued to withstand the new pressures (Burundi, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Zaire) or are still at the stage of promises or in the planning phase (Tanzania, Malawi, etc). Some countries show signs of reversing their new political freedoms (Kenya, Benin, Nigeria). 
<p>
National elections and the freedom to form different parties have provided only a first, partial step towards political liberalisation. Often the single governing party has been replaced by fragmented party systems. Effective opposition parties have rarely emerged or been allowed to emerge and have usually failed to offer alternative economic agendas (eg Tanzania), while pre-electoral debates have shown little concern with economic policy and programme issues (eg Kenya). Where more public debate has been encouraged it has indicated a low level of popular understanding of basic issues and hard economic choices. Indeed, public debate and elections can be viewed as more about the power of the state, personalities and human rights issues than economic policy choices. 
<p>
The new 'electoralism' in Africa potentially offered scope for the election of governments representing fresh coalitions committed to more vigorous economic reform. Yet, so far, elections have resulted in only a few changes of government (Benin, Cape Verde, Mali, Congo, Madagascar and Zambia). In Benin quite substantial economic reform had already taken place before the political liberalisation. However, the open debate before the elections (1989) generated demands to which the new government did not have the means to respond, and the reform seems to have stagnated. In Zambia, political reform and the change of government have accelerated economic reform efforts. (See <a href="odi_pol_zambia.html">POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM IN ZAMBIA</a>) 
<p>
A new government has not always been necessary to propel economic reform. In Gambia, after considerable economic deterioration, the incumbent government party was re-elected in 1985 on a strong reform platform. It has carried out significant liberalisation, devaluing the exchange rate, liberalising the price of groundnuts, the main cashcrop, and cutting the public sector workforce, while keeping the public fully informed. Authoritarian government in Ghana pursued major and effective economic reforms and stabilisation measures in the 1980s, well before the holding of national elections (though with limited political liberalisation) in 1992. Although successful economic reform efforts in the past were undoubtedly a factor in the re-establishment of the incumbent regime, the election itself weakened the previously successful fiscal stabilisation programme.
<p>
Elections have not removed incumbent governments elsewhere, in Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon and Nigeria, and the momentum of economic reform appears threatened. These elections were contested and when the results were rejected by wide sections of society, this weakened the legitimacy of the government and its confidence in embarking on stronger economic measures, and may result in some inertia.
<p>
So far there is limited evidence of opposition parties and individual MPs within newly elected assemblies articulating more effective criticism of government economic policy or scrutinising and following up misuse of public funds more vigorously. The traditional dominance of the executive over the legislature has remained little changed and this especially limits the scope for improvement in public expenditure management - an important economic reform.
<p>
Despite some moves towards fiscal stabilisation during the years of political protest and liberalisation, much remains to be done to bring inflation under control. There has been widespread liberalisation of marketing and pricing of major food crops in the last few years and (to a less extent) of major agricultural exports, but the rate of progress seems to have had little to do with the extent of political freedom, elections or changes of government, nor with the influence of small farmers and rural constituencies which have been seen as a new force under more democratic systems. 
<p>
A key to sustained development is a more competent, independent civil service, motivated less by loyalties of patronage and more by performance- related incentives. However, civil service reform has proved to be a long-term problem everywhere and difficult to achieve in the current political transition.
<p>
Overall, political reform in sub-Saharan Africa has thus far been only partial and, together with the survival of patronage networks, has generated somewhat unfavourable conditions for maintaining the momentum of economic reform. Partial liberalisation brings about a politically mobilised but discontented population and the continuance of governments which lack widespread public support or credibility, and seems likely to paralyse economic change rather than to galvanise it.
<p>
<h3>What Are We to Conclude?</h3>
Neither authoritarian rule nor continued political liberalisation offers an assured framework for economic reform. Several Latin American countries are in the process of consolidating democracy and there have been important economic reforms. In sub- Saharan Africa, partial political reform has so far not generated very promising conditions for democracy or economic reform.
<p>
Those seeking from outside to achieve simultaneous political and economic liberalisation will need to think through very carefully the pace and the means by which this is to be encouraged.

<h3>DONORS AND THEIR CRITICS</h3>
<hr>
In the 1990s, donors are setting the double requirement of political and economic reform as the condition for the release of aid to recipient countries. Political conditions have related primarily to improved behaviour on civic and political rights and on free and fair national elections. This has attracted three main criticisms:
<p>
<ul><li>That donor understanding of appropriate and sustainable political changes has been weak. There has been excessive concern with multi-party electoral systems and insufficient concern with more fundamental issues of civic interest groups and political party mobilisation and articulation which will offer the public policy choices.
<p>
<li>That donors have not been explicit on how or why political liberalisation and wider participation in decision-making will ensure more effective implementation of economic reforms.
<p>
<li>That donors who set political conditions and consider their implementation of fundamental priority need to relax the pace and extent of their parallel economic reform conditions, since there may be considerable incompatibility between them, especially during periods of political transition.

<h3>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM IN ZAMBIA</h3>
<hr>
 Zambia since 1990 is a rare case in Africa of a country that has embarked on the difficult strategy of simultaneous political and economic reform. The new government typically in such a situation, has inherited a legacy of economic mismanagement and decline. How does the balance sheet look after two years of experience of the Third Republic? 
<p>
Novel political developments were free and fair elections which produced a government led by the newly established Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), the emergence of newspapers outspoken in their criticisms of government action, and a more active and wider range of civic interest groups. 
<p>
Economic reforms have included a major devaluation of the exchange rate, liberalised foreign currency management and cuts in some subsidies. The large budget deficit has over two years been turned into a surplus despite delays because of drought. An ambitious five year privatisation plan has been initiated, labour markets have been liberalised and interest rates deregulated.
<p>
Other economic reforms, including the reform of public enterprises and relaxation of state control over food and export marketing and prices, have been slow in implementation and there has been public suspicion about the way privatisation has been handled.  There has also been resistance to change from the unions and disaffection in the townships.
<p>
Some commentators have suggested that further economic reforms (which adversely affect the dominant interest groups in Zambia), if too long delayed, may not yield their benefits soon enough to enable the fragile democratic structure to survive, with the MMD itself already suffering from internal disputes and breakaway movements.
